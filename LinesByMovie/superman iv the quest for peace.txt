are we going to skip the country, uncle lex?
lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. your uncle lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . destroying superman!
regardez.  voila monsieur david warfield.
that tycoon who owns all those sleazy tabloids?
au contraire, mon ami! he owns all those sleazy tabloids and the daily planet!
not so fast!  all trips are canceled. we pay for wire services. and what we don't get from them, we'll invent.
mr. white, come with me i want to see
no paris?
i don't think we're being treated fairly, lois. and i'm going to tell miss warfield.
clark . . . wait!
is he for real?
one hundred percent.  and i like him that way.
i think he's kind of cute.
forget it, princess. clark is the world's oldest boy scout  trustworthy, loyal, obedient, helpful... and i don't remember the rest, but he's them too. and i promise, he's not interested in anyone like you.
but all men like me, lois. i'm very rich.
. . . and  very naïve!
the president is about to speak. i don't think it's going to be good news.
you always overreact, clark. how terrible can it be?
do you realize what i can create with a single strand of superman's hair!
a toupee that flies?
. . . i look at you, lenny, and i know how the romans felt when the barbarians arrived at their city gate.
but why the hair?
that hair contains a sample of superman's genetic material. the building blocks of his body. with my genius and enough nuclear power to mutate those genes, i will create a being with all his powers . . . but with absolute allegiance to me!
it's brilliant. daddy thinks so, too. you'll write a new series -- 'metropolis after hours.'
i really don't think . . .
but you're perfect for it. you're young, you're single, you're successful...
and i'm usually in bed by ten-thirty.
that's just it! you don't have to flaunt it. you're no slave to fashion ... although ...
they make my eyes itch.
don't worry. i won't make you do it alone. i know all the right places. i'm a member at all the right clubs . . . we'll start tonight at the grand opening of the metro club! it's a date!
this letter was addressed to superman care of me.
superman gets mail here?
oh, probably just a picture request. i'll take care of it if you want, lois.
i don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  read it, clark.
i think there's an angle.
an angle?
daddy loves to whip up campaigns! people eat it up. we'll make this kid a celebrity. the whole world will be waiting for superman's answer.
impossible? why?
because i made a vow. never to interfere in the destiny of your planet.
but what good is a vow if everything gets blown away?  what good was my letter?
i'm going to pass this letter on to all the leaders of the world. i promise you. for it is they , and not i, that represent the people of earth.
well, i don't understand.
i'm sorry.
he missed the door, uncle lex.
quiet! you'll make him self-conscious.
what i need this for?
for dignity. my reputation is at stake. just put it on.
whoa. . .
he has all of superman's powers. if i've planned it right. . .
gee, uncle lex, i don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
let's try to keep your i.q. a family secret, leonard. before we launch him against superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the metro club gala. and once he proves himself, then . . .
you're late. very late.
gosh, i'm sorry, we better get in line.
oh, clark, you're so delightfully primitive.
i've never been in a place like this before.
this is metropolis after hours! this is what you'll be writing about. c'mon, let's dance.
don't tell me. you learned to dance at church socials.
actually, i had a crash course from my mother the night before my prom.
my prom was so boring. we all flew to paris the next day to recover . . . sometimes my whole life seems boring. i thing maybe i should just give everything away and go live among the poor people. then i remember how smashing i look in sable . . . oh, it's all so confusing. you think i'm silly, don't you?
no ... metropolis is a confusing place. back in smallville -- my hometown -- everything was more simple. people would sacrifice everything just to lend a helping hand.
that's not what we were taught. 'look out for number one' -- that's daddy's golden rule ... he always ends up with the gold.
oh . . . no, there's no one back home.
what about here?
well, my career takes up a lot of my time.
don't tell me you're waiting for lightning to strike. wide-eyed romantics are an endangered species.
that sounds kind of pessimistic.
no, realistic. there's no magic in the world. girls just don't get swept off their feet anymore.
i feel kind of light-headed . . .
don't worry, i've got you.
superman broke your monster, uncle lex.
i must have miscalculated. how. . .
who does clark kent think he is anyway! he never even said good night!
clark kent! you socialized with him . . . a . . . reporter!
oh . . . no . . . i mean, we just went  dancing . . . for  a story . . .
your grandfather had one iron rule that's stood me well. never fraternize with the help. keep too your own station. am i clear?
i know i'm not exactly a girl scout but . . . maybe if i show him i'm trying . . . he'll like me.
who?
clark. he's late again.  i can't figure him out.
that's because there's nothing to figure out. now will you please pay attention. i'm not through insulting your father.
lois, have you ever fallen for a guy and he's not like other guys . . . he's different. it's like you come from two different worlds.
and your heart beats faster just thinking about him.
right . . . you want to tell him how you feel . . .
but he's never there.
why, lois, i didn't know . . . who is he?
would you mind taking a walk with me?
absolutely!
would you mind waiting for me in the visitor's gallery?
n-no...i mean...you bet.
what's he going to say?
something . . . wonderful.
gee, uncle lex, i was just getting to the good part.
get the box, nephew.
close the curtains. the sun is hurting my eyes.
of course it is. do you know what the sun is? why it's just one huge nuclear bomb. a bomb with enough radiation to incinerate an average man like . . .  that.
but superman isn't an average man.
and what am i? a shriner? no, if you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
boys, old lex has a secret recipe in this dish . . . call it a genetic stew. you help me place it on one of your missiles and i promise you . . . if superman throws it into the sun, he'll get the biggest surprise of his life. i'll be able to introduce superman to his first nightmare . . . a nuclear man!
and this so-called . . . nuclear man. . . of yours can defeat superman?
do people die in italian operas? gentlemen, if all goes to plan nuclear man will return from the sun with power awesome enough to do what none before him has ever been able to . . . pierce superman's skin. he'll be mortal, he'll get sick . . . and we'll dance on his grave.
and what do we get out of it?
if my plan works, gentlemen, i'll just take a tiny commission . . . something . . .appropriate. . . a number with a lot of zeros after it.
maybe i should sit this one out.
don't give up. this is a perfect subject for your series on young metropolis. now let's get those knees up!
now you try, clark. we'll start you off with 60 pounds.
if you say so. here goes.
he's a jerk. i never noticed it before. seems like a lot of people i know are jerks . . .  . . . maybe you think the same thing about me. that's why you keep avoiding me.
i'm not avoiding you. i've been very busy and . . . i like you . . . i really do.
then prove it. lois is doing an interview with superman about his peace mission . . .
yes, i know. i'm sure it will be a great story.
i'll just invite them both to my hotel suite and we'll have high tea. it's very chic.
gee, i don't think . . .
come early. the view is so romantic from my balcony.
hey, uncle lex, how's the nuclear guy goin' to find his way here?
oh leonard . . . when i sent the remains of my last experiment . . .
the one superman wrecked up?
not how i might have put it, but, correct. the remains i sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. he'll remember everything that he experienced. not to worry. he'll find his way back to me.  did you hear that?
you're spookin' me out, uncle lex.
there!
hey! he looks . . . normal.
he's . . .  beautiful. perfect.
i hadn't counted on this but . . .  . . . of course - the power of the sun has given him internally generated heat. i am a ...
you are . . .
what? a genius? . . . an inspiration?
you are . . . nothing. i am father now.
hey! just remember i made you.
you're just an experiment, freako!
i am an experiment? i am freako?
i made you, and i can destroy you.
what was that about?
didn't you see it? he lifted me up and crashed me down.
hmm . . . nuclear levitation. now that's a trick that could come in handy.
he's . . . cold. . .
good. let's hope he stays that way.
of course! that's his one vulnerability. the one way he can be stopped.
what?
hello, lacy. can anybody break a twenty? the cabbie didn't have any change.
. . . let me get my purse.
'are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
it's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. how can i ask superman such a dumb question.
politely?
shouldn't you pay the cabbie?
oh . . . right. . . i'll be back in a flash.
what's that?
our other dinner guest.
i missed you. it wasn't any fun up there with just lois and superman. they're so boring. let's go do something wild!
but they're expecting us. it wouldn't be polite.
oh . . . my . . .
clark. . . !
where's clark?
he was getting on . . . and then this man with luggage and . . .  oh, it's a long story.
it always is with clark.
hi. is dinner ready? i'm famished.
let's sit down. they walk to the table. lois calls out to the balcony.
gee, i'm really sorry.
no mind, it's only antique irish linen.
guess who? it's your old friend, lex.
luthor, i suspect if you had actually planted a bomb you'd be far away from here by now.
silly me. how do i ever think i can fool the super guy. you're right, no bomb. i just knew you were too busy with the world peace bit to make a social call.  i confess . . . i tricked you. hey, you look great!
if you have any social skills, you've learned them from a rattlesnake. just what are you up to?
know something? you're a workaholic. a good guy 24 hours a day. stop and smell the roses sometime. take up a hobby. get a pet . . . a kitten or a puppy. . .
it's common knowledge you hate children and animals. why are you back in metropolis?
why? because i want to be the first one to introduce you to a new kid on the block.
look closely at his cell structure. see anything familiar?
you've broken all the laws of man, luthor. and now you've broken the laws of nature! . . .  i assume you must have hidden a device in one of the missiles i hurled into the sun!
boy, are you gonna get it.
my nephew, leonard. he worships me.  let's share a toast to you . . . a nice guy who's about to finish last.
destroy superman!
wait! not yet! back!
your time in prison has twisted you into a delusionary state, luthor.
no, no, listen. i escaped with only one thing on my mind . . . the end of superman.
i'm not going anywhere.
i'll ignore that . . . so, i created a monster who didn't work nearly as well as i might have liked -- you were clearly his better  --  he needed more energy, more power.
which explains why you sent his organic matter to the sun.
precisely. and then it came to me. my greatest ever plan. i made a deal with some minor league bad boys. arms dealers, renegades generals, you know the type. with you gone, we'll make a fortune rearming the world.
you'd risk worldwide nuclear war for your own personal financial gains.
nobody wants war. i'd just like to keep the threat alive.
a mind is a terrible thing to waste, lex luthor. and you've wasted yours on this foul monstrosity. i'm taking you in.
nifty, huh?  goodnight sweet prince, parting is . . . inevitable  now, destroy superman.
first, i have fun.
. . . please leave your message at the beep.
clark, it's lois. this is the fourth message. i've left. . . where are you ?
darling, it's good riddance. let her go. and while you're at it, fire that clark kent. he hasn't been here in days. he hasn't even called.
i know daddy. i'm worried about him.
didn't we have our little talk about personal involvement with the help? now that you're the publisher . . .
daddy . . . ?
yes, darling?
stuff it.
lex, we all appreciate how you've supported us lately and . . . uh . . . in recognition of your hard work we've decided to increase your commission to 12 percent.
gee guys, that's swell of you. but  . . . i've got another idea.
nice bit. you're good. with my brain and your, well, frankly, brawn, the possibilities  are staggering. i could be . . . emperor, king! did you see how scared those guys were?
what do you fear?
me? now? with superman dead and you on my team? it's like i'm the coach and you're the best power forward ever. what could i have to fear?
destiny.
it's just a bad flu, really. how did you know . . .
you haven't been at work . . . you didn't call the office . . .  you didn't even call me. how could you not call back?
superman? has something happened to him?
everyone's saying he's . . . dead. but i know that isn't true. i feel it in my heart. i think he just needs help.
you know him so well.  but i'm sure he'll manage . . . wherever he is.
stop! i command you . . . you mutant!
i am master now.
tone down our headlines? lacy, that's all the common man reads!
i'd just like to have a little less sensationalism.
less sensational papers go broke. i thought i taught you long ago the business of newspapers is business.
no, daddy. our business is journalism. we can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
don't be over-dramatic, young lady. what kind of disaster could we help bring about?
we'll all fry.
this wasn't in the plan.
i think he has his own plan, uncle lex.
don't worry honey, i'm sure he'll make a swell husband.
ready, uncle lex?
if you need us we'll, be five hundred feet underground waiting for the nuclear winter to turn to nuclear spring.
superman. . .  but you're... dead!
still having delusions, lex luthor?
i'll deal with you later.
right, good. tell you what, we'll wait right here. till you get back.
you think he'll find us.
never. but we have to hide out for a  while. lay low. say. . . a couple of years. by then i'll have a new plan.
lucky i brought my drums.
but . . . how could you beat him?
high school physics, luthor. while i was recuperating i had time to figure out that if your foul creature was born from the sun, it must have been his source of energy.
but . . . but isn't the world about to be osterized?
no . . . it's the way it always is . . . on the brink . . . with good fighting evil.
daddy's offered me jobs at some of his other companies. but, i've been thinking maybe i'll take some time off.  i'm going to find a place like smallville, in the country. maybe a  farm . . .  see what the slow lane is like.
i'm sorry to see you go.
you don't have to be polite, clark. i've got a pretty good idea of how you feel about me.
i'm not so sure you do.
any more like you back home, clark?
like me?
you know: strong, gentle, tall men with bright blue eyes and square. men who like to dance slow, the old fashioned way, the way their mothers taught them on the night before their prom.
you'll find a good man lacy. you deserve one.
maybe if you'd have met who i am now, instead of the spoiled brat you met a few weeks ago, it would have been different between us.
lacy. . . i . . .
it must have been a super effort to get out of bed, clark.
well, i'm feeling a lot better . . . almost chipper . . .  . . . and all because i had a visit from a very good nurse.
awesome!
jeremy, i need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
i'll try. . .
well . . . i see the ocean currents. . . and the rain . . . and mountains and rivers. . . but . . .
go on . . .
but you can't tell where one country begins and another ends. you can't see any borders. it's just . . . one world.
good. if you can see it, and i can see it, maybe some day everyone will see it.
