well, wait now.  i still have to ask darryl if i can go.
you mean you have not asked him yet? for christ sake, thelma, is he your husband or your father?  it is just two days.  for god's sake, thelma. do not be a child.  just tell him you are goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  tell him I am havin' a nervous breakdown.
he already thinks you are out of your mind, louise, that do not carry much weight with darryl.  are you at work?
no, I am callin' from the playboy mansion.
I will call you right back.
damnit, thelma, do not holler like that!  have not i told you i can not stand it when you holler in the morning.
I am sorry, doll, i just did not want you to be late.
hon.
what.
have a good day at work today.
uh-huh.
hon?
what?!
you want anything special for dinner?
no, thelma, i do not give a shit what we have for dinner.  i may not even make it home for dinner.  you know how fridays are.
funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a friday night.  you would almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
well then, it is a good thing you are not regional manager and i am.
'bye, honey.  i will not wait up.
see ya.
not this weekend, sweetie, she is runnin' away with me.  hi.  what did he say?
what time are you gonna pick me up?
you are kiddin'!  alright!  I will be there around two or three.
what kind of stuff do i bring?
i do not know.  warm stuff, i guess. it is the mountains.  i guess it gets cold at night.  I am just going to bring everything.
okay.  i will, too.
and steal darryl's fishin' stuff.
i do not know how to fish, louise.
neither do i, thelma, but darryl does it, how hard can it be?  I will see you later.  be ready.
we do not need the lantern.  the place has electricity.
i wanna take it anyway.  just in case.
in case of what?
in case there is some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
oh yeah, sure, thelma, that lantern will come in real handy.  maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
we would have to.  that thing barely makes it down the driveway.
whose place is this again?
it is bob's, the day manager's.  he is gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he is just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
I have never had the chance to go out of town without darryl.
how come he let you go?
'cause i did not ask him.
aw, shit, thelma, he is going to kill you.
well, he has never let me go.  he never lets me do one goddamn thing that is any fun.  all he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he is out doing god only knows what.
how much longer is it going to be?  I am hungry.
another hour of so.  we have got enough food for a month.
I will never make it... can not we stop just for a few minutes...
we have not going to get to the cabin till after dark as it is, thelma.
then what difference does it make if we stop?  come on.  i never get to do stuff like this.
i have not seen a place like this since i left texas.
is not this fun?
thelma!
tell me somethin'.  is this my vacation or is not it?  i mean, god, you are as bad as darryl.
i just have not seen you like this in a while.  I am used to seeing you more sedate.
well, I have had it up to my ass with sedate!  you said you and me was going to get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
alright...  i changed my mind.  I will have a margarita with and a shot of cuervo on the side, please.
yeah!
your name's harlan?  i got an uncle named harlan!
you do?  is he a funny uncle? 'cause if he is, then he and i got somethin' in common.
jeez, louise, that was not very nice.
can not you tell when somebody is hittin' on you?
so what if he was?  it is all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that is all.
maybe.
well, just relax, will ya.  you are makin' me nervous.
so, jimmy still has not called yet?
givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  asshole.
I am sorry, louise.  i know you are all upset.  it is just I am so excited to be out of the house, i guess.  i wonder if darryl's home yet.
i wonder if jimmy's gotten back.
why do not you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
why do not you ditch that loser husband of yours?
exactly.
in the meantime, you said we were going to have some fun.  so let's have some!
thelma, I am going to hit the little girls' room, and then we got to hit the road.
ready when you are.
oh shit.
what is wrong?
stop.
what for?
I am spinning.
i guess I am startin' to feel a little better.
yeah, you are startin' to feel pretty good to me, too.
don't.  I am married.  i do not feel good.  I have been sick.
it is okay.  I am married, too.
you are beautiful.  it is okay.  i will not hurt you.  it is okay.
stop it!  goddamnit, i mean it! louise is gonna wonder where i am. let go!
louise is alright.
do not hurt me.  harlan.  please.
shut up.
oh my god.
get the car.
jesus christ!  louise, you shot him.
get the car!
shit!  i... i, which way?
west.  left.
louise.  where are we going?
i do not know, thelma!  i do not know! just shut up a minute so i can think.
should not we go to the cops?  i mean, i think we should tell the police.
tell them what?!  what, thelma? what do you think we should tell them?
i do not know.  just tell 'em what happened.
which part?
all of it.  that he tried to rape me.
only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, thelma!  who is going to believe that?!  we just do not live in that kind of world.  pull over!
we gotta be inconspicuous.  do you know what that means?
yes.
it means you do not talk to anybody. you do not draw attention to yourself in any way.  do you understand that?
we have to think this through.  we have to be smart.  now is not the time to panic.  if we panic now, we are done for.  nobody saw it. nobody knows it was us.  we are still okay.  now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
our next move?  I will say one thing, louise.  this is some vacation.  i sure am having a good time.  this is real fun.
if you were not so concerned with having a good time, we would not be here right now.
just what is that supposed to mean?
it means shut up, thelma.
so this is all my fault, is it.
could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?
hal, I have told you about twenty times, yes, i could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.
well, you are not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?
if waitin' tables in a bar do not make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and i could have told you that harlan puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. I am just surprised it did not happen before now.
who do you think did it?
has anybody asked his wife?  she is the one i hope did it.
lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya?  do have any ideas or do not ya? i been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and i still got to go file a report before i can go home in time to get back up again!
well, if i had to guess, I would say it was some old gal, some old gal's husband.  but it was not either one of those two.  the tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.
you did not happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?
it is a nightclub, not a drive-in, hal.  i do not follow the customers to the parking lot.
alright, lena.  go on home.  we might have to call you in for some more questioning.
we are going to go to the next town and stop.  we will get a motel room.  i can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  we are going to need money.  thelma.  how much money do you have with you?
what?  oh, i do not know.  let me look.
I am cash poor.
hmmm.  we gotta get some money.
oh, i do not know.  I am just nervous. i got to figure out what to do.
well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
just what the hell is wrong with you?
what do you mean?
why are you actin' like this?
actin' like what?!  how am i supposed to act?  'scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody is head off!
you could help me try and figure it out!  i gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.
i suggested we go to the police, but you did not like that; so, frankly, louise, I am all out of ideas.
well, what is the big rush, thelma? if we just give 'em some time, they will come to us...!  oh christ. I am just not ready to go to jail yet.  why do not you go out to the pool or something and I will figure it out...
give me the keys.
you are not touchin' that car.
my stuff's in the trunk!  god!  you care more about that car than you do about most people.
most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it.
louise!  where are you?  are you alright?  honey...
hi.  I am okay.  how are you?  long time no see.
louise, honey... where are you?  you sound funny.
i am funny.  I am real funny.
are you in town?  this sounds long distance.
no, I am out of town.  I am in... I am in real deep shit, jimmy.  deep shit arkansas.
louise, just tell me what the hell is going on here!  i come back, nobody knows where you are.  is thelma with you?  darryl's been callin' here every half-hour sayin' he is going to kill you both when you get back, he is goin' nuts.  i do not envy her if she is.
where did you all go?
fishing.  look, jimmy... i need you to help me.  this is serious.  I am in trouble and i need you to help me.  can you do that?
i have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. now i know you will not be able to get it out, but I am good for it.  i need that money.  can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I will pay you back?  please, I am desperate.
what the fuck is going on?
something real bad has happened and i can not tell you what, just that it is bad and i did it and i can not undo it.  can you help me?
of course.  of course!  where?  can not i bring it to you?  for god's sake, baby, please, just tell me what is happened, what could possibly be so bad?
do you love me?
christ, sure... yes!
wire it to the western union in oklahoma city,
you are in oklahoma?!
not yet.
louise, let me call you back after i wire it, so you will know which office to go to.
can not it go to any office?
no, for that much money i have to tell them exactly which office.  i know, I have had to have money wired to me on the road.  and there has to be a code word or they will not give it to you.  I will have to tell you the code.
tell me now.
call me back.
okay.  I will call you back.  in an hour.  do not tell darryl.
i know.  call me back.  louise, i love you, okay?
okay.
did you finish thinking?
i think better when i drive.
all we know is there were two women in a green t-bird convertible that turned left out of the parking lot, going real fast.  we are trying to get a make on the car, but nothin' yet.  so far, we got nothin'.
well, you would best get something. even if they did not do it, it times out that they most likely witnessed it.  i want somebody to at least talk to 'em.  put out an apb with a description and see what we get back.
alright.
is there any reason to believe they have left the state?
that is certainly possible.
why do not we go ahead and let the bureau in on this.
i have no problem with that.
somebody is butt is going to bar-b-que.
do not get mad, louise, but where are we going?
oklahoma city.  jimmy's going to wire me some money, and then...
you talked to him?!  is he mad?  did you tell him?
no, i did not tell him.  and that is something we got to get straight. darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. when you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this.  you got to make sure everything sounds normal.
i called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he was not even home.  i do not know what he is got to be mad about.  I am the one who should be mad.
I have been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
do you think darryl's having an affair?
i do not think darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
but you think he fools around.
thelma, I am going to mexico.  i think i can make it in two and a half days, but I am going to have to haul ass.  are you up to this?  i mean, i have to know.  this is not a game.  I am in deep shit.  i got to know what you are going to do.
i... i do not know.  i do not know what you are askin' me.
do not you fall apart on me. goddamnit, thelma.  every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... not this time. everything's changed now... now you can do whatever you want, but I am going to mexico.  I am going.  are you coming with me?
is that how you answer the phone?
i got it.  i was afraid I would missed you.  i almost could not get a check cashed.  it is saturday.
who did it?
friend of mine, owns a club.  dickie randall.  you would know him if you saw him.  his brother was in your class. terry.
you did not say what it was for, did you?
no, honey.  i told him i was buyin' a car.  what is it for?
good.  that was good.  where do i go?
it is a place called shaw's siesta motel.  the address is 1921 north east 23.  it is under your name.
and what is the mysterious code word?
peaches.
what?
that is the code word.  i miss you, peaches.
call him?
call him.  do not tell him anything. tell him you are having a wonderful time and you will be home tomorrow night.
will i be?
i do not know.  i will not be.
... only for one day and we will be back tomorrow night.
no you won't.  you will be back today. now!  you get your ass back here, thelma, now, goddamnit.  thelma, do you understand me?
darryl.
what?
go fuck yourself.
louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and i thought since...
it is probably not a good idea.
louise.
i wish we could have brought him with us.
what did darryl say?
he said "okay, thelma.  i just wanted to know you were alright.  i hope you are havin' a good time.  you sure deserve one after puttin' up with me all the time.  i love you, honey."
i just do not see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride.  did you see his butt?  darryl does not have a cute butt.  you could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
I am sorry.  I am just not in the mood for company right now.  here.  take this map.  i need you to find all the secondary roads to mexico from oklahoma city.  i think we should stay off the interstates.  we are too conspicuous.
well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards dallas, then cut over to...
i do not want to go that way.  find a way that we do not have to go through texas.
wait.  what?  you want to go to mexico from oklahoma and you do not want to go through texas?
you know how i feel about texas... we are not going that way.
i know, louise, but we are running for our lives!  do not you think you could make an exception just this once?!  i mean, look at the map. the only thing between oklahoma and mexico is texas!
thelma!  I am not going to talk about this!  now find another way or give me the goddamn map and i will!  you understand?
no, louise.  how come you never said what happened?
so j.d., what are you studying in school?
human nature.  I am majoring in behavioral science.
so how come you do not have any kids?
darryl, that is my husband, he says he is not ready.  he is still too much of a kid himself.  he prides himself on being infantile.
he is got a lot to be proud of.
louise and darryl do not get along.
that is puttin' it mildly.
she thinks he is a pig.
he is a real piece o' work.  i wish you could meet him.
did you get married real young?
twenty-four is not young.  I would already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married.  I have never been with anybody but darryl.
well, if you do not mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
it is okay.  he is an asshole.  most of the time i just let it slide.
what kind of gun was it?
a .38.
right.  where are they?
hey, peaches.
oh my god!  jimmy!  you... oh my god!  what are you doin' here?
can we get another room?  just put it on my credit card.
jimmy!  hello, stranger.  what in the world are you doin' here?
ask me no questions, I will tell you no lies.
good answer.  same goes double for me.
who is your friend?
this is j.d.  he is a student.  we are just givin' him a ride to... to here.  louise said we could bring him here and then he would have to go. and that is what he is doin'.  he is goin'.  are not you, j.d.?
yup.  thanks for the ride.  you all take care.
yup.  that is him goin'.  i love to watch him go.
thelma kinda took to him.
well, come on, gal, i got you a room.  you can go on in and take a nice cold shower.
do not mind me, jimmy, I am just a wild woman.
i always knew that.
a regular outlaw.
i do not care what you say about him. the boy has got it bad.
he is always got it bad as long as I am running in the other direction. do not be fooled, he is no different than any other guy.  he knows how to chase and that is it.  once he is caught you, he do not know what to do.  so he runs away.
i heard that.
so what are you gonna tell him?
nothing.  I am not going to tell him a thing.  the least i can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
you are so sweet to that guy, you really are.  imagine not wanting to drag him into this.  he is a lucky man.
i did not ask him to come!  it is like i said, thelma, he just loves the chase.
well boy, he is got his work cut out for him now, do not he?
put a lid on it, thelma!  it is hard enough as it is.  just let me get this part over with.  now stay here and guard the money.  if there is any problem I am in room 115.
i will not wait up.
how do i look?
you are a vision, louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
have another drink, thelma.
hello...
who is it?
it is me.
louise, is that you?
thelma?  it is me.
well, i guess I would better...
wait...!  um, where ya going?
i do not know.  nowhere.  what are you doin'?
i do not know.  nothin'.  took a shower.
that sounds nice.
well, you wanna use the shower?
oh.  i... where is louise?
she is off with jimmy, that is her boyfriend.
that is lonely for you, i guess.  i always think of motel rooms as lonely.
now, my little coconut, what seems to be the trouble here?  tell daddy everything.
jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
okay, okay, just tell me what is the trouble.
okay, peaches, okay.  but can i ask you one thing?
maybe.
does it have something to do with another guy?  are you in love with him?
it is nothin' like that.
then what?!  what, goddamnit, louise!  where the fuck are you going?  are you just leaving for fucking ever?  what, did you fuckin' murder somebody or what?!
stop it!  stop it, jimmy, or I will leave right now.  I am not kiddin'!
alright, alright.  I am sorry.
can i just ask you one other thing?
maybe.
will you at least see how it fits?
jimmy... it is beautiful!
you did not see that one comin', did ya?
so whaddya think.  i mean... i could... uh... get a job.  of some kind.  i mean you have been tellin' me that for years, right?
why now, jimmy?
'cause, louise.  i do not want to lose you.  and for some reason i get the feelin' you are about to split. permanently.
I am the one... i never made it work. i just... it is not that i do not love you.  it is not that.  i just never thought I would be thirty-six years old and i never thought... i do not know what i thought.  what do you want, darlin'.  what do you want me to do.
i do not know.  it does not even matter anymore.  i just want you to be happy... it is not that i do not love you either.  but jimmy, your timing could not be worse.
are you just doin' this to punish me?
believe me, the last thing i want is for you to get punished.
i am the great and powerful oz...
j.d.!  just tell me.  i know you are not some schoolboy.  now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
I am just some guy.  a guy whose parole officer is probably having a shit fit right about now.
what?!  parole officer?  you mean you are a criminal?
well, not anymore, thelma, except for bustin' parole, i have not done one wrong thing.
what did ya do?
I am a robber.
you are a bank robber?
nope.  I have never robbed a bank.
what?
well, i robbed a gas station once, and i robbed a couple of liquor stores, and some convenience stores. and that is it.
how?
well, i was just down on my luck and it seemed like somethin' i was good at so i...
no, i mean how would you do it?  do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
naw, honey, that would be burglary. i never got arrested for burglary. burglary's for chicken shits.  if you are going to rob someone, ya just have to go right on up to 'em and do it.  just take the money.  that is robbery.  that is a whole 'nother deal.
tell me.
well, first you pick your place, see, then I would just sit back and watch it for awhile.  ya got to wait for just the right moment, which is something you know instinctively, that can not be taught.  then I would waltz on in...
I have always believed if done right, armed robbery does not have to be a totally unpleasant experience.
god.  you are a real live outlaw!
i may be the outlaw, but you are the one stealin' my heart.
and smooth, boy, you are smooth.
you are kinda the best thing that is happened to me in a long time.
you are a little angle, you are.
do not worry darlin'.  I will say i never found you.  I will say anything you want.  we will find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
damn, jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
I am choking on it.
honey?
yes, baby?
do you think you could ever shoot someone?
what?
do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
i could shoot your cousin eddie.
why?
because he is an inconsiderate asshole.
I am asking you seriously, sarah, a stranger?
i do not know, honey.  i guess it would depend.
on what?
well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids.  I am sure i could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
yeah, i could too.  but... i do not know why I am even asking you this. it is just... we can not place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. i do not know.  i keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable.  if just one person would say...
honey.  nothing's impossible.  you just do not shoot someone like that for no reason.  maybe he was askin' for it.  anyway, somebody is husband probably got old harlan.
that is what everybody says.  only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... could you shoot eddie in the face?  at point blank range?
in the leg.
i gotta go to little rock.
what happened to your hair?
nothing.  it got messed up.
what is wrong with you?
nothing.  why?  do i seem different?
yes, now that you mention it.  you seem crazy.  like you are on drugs.
well, I am not on drugs.  but i might be crazy.
i do not think i wanna hear what you are going to tell me.
oh, thelma.  oh, no.
i mean i finally understand what all the fuss is about.   this is just a whole 'nother ball game!
thelma, please get a hold of yourself.  you are making a spectacle.
you know, louise, you are supposed to be my best friend.  you could at least be a little bit happy for me. you could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life i have a sexual experience that is not completely disgusting.
I am sorry.  i am happy.  I am very happy for you.  I am glad you had a good time.  it is about time.  where is he now?
taking a shower.
you left that guy alone in the room?
we are going to leave someone here at the house in the event that she calls in.  someone will be here until we find them.
the important thing is not to let on that you know anything.  we want to try and find out where they are. now i do not want to get too personal, but do you have a good relationship with your wife?  are you close with her?
eighty-eight dollars am not going to make a dent, baby girl.
do not worry about it.  you want anything?
no.
drive!  drive away!
what happened?
I am sorry.  well, we need the money. now we have it.
oh shit, thelma!!  shit!  shit! shit!
now you get a grip, louise!  just drive us to goddamn mexico, will ya!
okay.  shit, thelma!  what did you do? i mean, what did you say?
well, i just...
good god.
my lord.
holy shit.
lemme see the map.
for the first time in my life, i wish this car was not green.
are you sure we should be driving like this?  in broad daylight and everything?
no we shouldn't, but i want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last goddamn crime!
oooooweee!!  you shoulda seen me! like I would been doin' it all my life! nobody would ever believe it.
you think you have found your calling?
maybe.  maybe.  the call of the wild!
you are disturbed.
yes!  i believe i am!
i swear to god, she would not tell me one thing!  christ!  you oughta try to find that kid that was with 'em.
tell us about him.
just some young guy.  around twenty years old.  dark hair.
this is serious, son.  a man is dead.
i know!  I would tell you if i knew! goddamn!  i know something happened, or she would not have left.  I am trying to remember everything!  find that fucking kid.  he probably knows something.
so what is the plan, thelma?  you just going to stay drunk?
try to.
litterbug.
ugh!!  why do they have to do that?
they think we like it.  maybe they think it turns us on.
is this the guy you saw them with?
it is him.
armed robber.
oh, great.
thelma.
yeah.
i want you to call darryl.
what for?
to find out if he knows anything. if you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
jeez, louise, tapped the phone?  you think so?
oh, come on!  murder one and armed robbery, thelma!
murder one!  god, louise, can not we even say it was self-defense?
but it wasn't!  we got away!  we were walkin' away!
they do not know that!  it was just you and me there.  I will say he raped me and you had to shoot him!  i mean, it is almost the truth!
it will not work.
why not?!
no physical evidence.  we can not prove he did it.  we probably can not even prove he touched you by now.
besides, what do we say about the robbery?  no excuse for that.  no such thing as justifiable robbery.
alright, louise!
who is the nut?
that is thelma dickinson's husband.
aw, god.
alright!  she did good!  did not she?
well, son, she is doin' a damn sight better 'n you right now.
we spoke with a gentlemen today who says he personally delivered very close to that same amount to a miss louise sawyer.  do you know her too?
umm, yes.  she was driving.
he said he took it to a motel in oklahoma city.  he also says that at that time he met a man.  he identified you through a series of mug shots.  he also told us that you and mrs. dickinson seemed "close." is that true?
you might say we had a meeting of the minds, yes.
did either of them ever indicate that they might be running from the law?
now that you mention it, they might have been a little bit jumpy.
you know what?  you are starting to irritate me.
how do you know i took it?  how do you know they did not just give it to me?
there is two girls out there that had a chance, they had a chance...!  and you blew it for 'em.  now they have gotten in some serious trouble, some very serious trouble and for at least part of it, I am going to hold you personally responsible for anything that happens to them.  I have got no feelin' for you.  but i may be the only person in the world who gives a rat's ass what happens to them and you are either going to tell me every damn thing you know, so there is a small chance i can actually do them some good, or I am going to be all over you like a fly on shit for the rest of your natural life.  your misery is going to be my goddamn mission in life.  that is a sincere promise.
now, for one thing, you violated your parole two days out.  and you know judge hainey.  he hates this sort of thing.  once he gets wind of this, he is going to blow sky high.  and then when he finds out that you are a possible accessory to murder and armed robbery, well, i think we can safely place your ass back in the slammer for at least the remaining eight, do not you?
oh, definitely.
fill her up.  there is a phone right over there.
let's get it over with.
I have been better.
you girls are in some hot water.
yes, sir.  i know.
we are both fine.
good.  you wanna tell me what happened?
sure.  maybe over coffee sometime. I will buy.
that j.d. kid is a little shit.
what.
how did they find out we are going to mexico, thelma, how they know that?
i... i...
you told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'?!
i just told him if he ever gets to mexico to look us up.  i asked him not to tell.  i did not think he would tell anybody.
why not?!  what is he got to lose? other than my life's savings, that is.  shit!
just stop talkin' to people, thelma! stop bein' so open!  we are fugitives now.  let's behave that way!
you are right.
louise?  where are we?
just past boise city.
idaho?
oklahoma, thelma.  we are crossing into new mexico.
i always wanted to see new mexico.
now what?
now what what?
whaddo we do?
oh, i do not know, thelma.  i guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on saturdays.  maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
I am not suggestin' that!  I am not goin' back.  no matter what happens. so do not worry about me.
can i ask you kind of a weird question?
yeah.
of all the things in the world that scare you, what is the worst thing that scares you the most?
you mean now or before?
before.
i guess i always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
what little dogs?
you know those little dogs you see people with?
like a chihuahua?
those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
oh yeah.  you mean peek-a-poos.
yeah.  those.  that always put the fear of god in me.  what about you?
well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
i can see that.
i mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  it is bad enough i have to get old, but doin' it with darryl around is only going to make it worse.  i mean, i do not think he is going to be very nice about it.
well, now, maybe you will not have to.
always lookin' on the bright side, are not ya?
this is so beautiful.
gosh.  it sure is.
i always wanted to travel.  i just never got the opportunity.
well, you got it now.
look!  look who it is, thelma.  I will be darned.  what is he doin' way out here.
just ignore him.
oh, christ.  i hate this guy.
we should have just ignored him.
what?
nothing.  it is not funny.
what?  what is not funny, thelma!
what?!
harlan.
what?!  what about him?!
just the look on his face when you...  ... it is not funny.
now, thelma, that is not...
boy, he was not expectin' that!
thelma!
suck my dick... boom!!
i do not want to talk about it! thelma, I am not kidding!  do not you even...
... in texas... did not it?  that is what happened... oh my god.
I am warning you, thelma.  you better drop it right now!  i do not want to talk about it!
okay, louise... it is okay.
what do we do?  what do you want to do?!
i do not know!  shit!  let's just play it by ear.  he may not know. he may just give me a ticket.
please, god, please do not let us get caught.  please, please, please...
hello, officer.  is there a problem?
you wanna let me see your license, please?
you wanna take it out of your wallet, please?
oh yeah.
i told you to slow down.  hell, officer, i told her to slow down.
about how fast was i going?
is this your car?
yes.
you wanna come with me, please? walk around and get in the car, please.
in the back?
front.
am i in trouble?
as far as I am concerned, yes, ma'am, you are.
i am really sorry about this.
i swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this.  but if you ever met my husband, you would know why i just can... you wanna step out of the car, please?  you wanna put your hands on your head, please?  louise, shoot the radio.
what?
shoot the radio!
sorry!
sorry!
ready?
hit it.
i know it is crazy, louise, but i just feel like I have got a knack for this shit.
i believe you.
it is just not working like this.  we got to do something.  it would be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but jesus, hal, this is makin' us look bad.  i do not know... maybe they are not movin'.  maybe that little creep lied.
he is got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  nothin' at all.  he already got all their money.  i just do not know what we are dealin' with here. anyway, it went out again last night on nationwide teletype.  let's just wait it out a little longer.  she said she was going to call back.  let's just sit tight.
we do not have a whole lotta choice, do we?  i can not figure out if they are real smart or just really, really lucky.
it do not matter.  brains will only get you so far and luck always runs out.
louise... are we still going to mexico?
yes.
well, i figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it is best to just get on out of the state if you can.
just asking.
i do not want to see any more beef jerky.  i mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. it is drivin' me crazy.  the whole car smells like it.
it is good.  it is what the pioneers ate.
i do not care what the damn pioneers ate.  you just keep that shit away from me, now i mean it.
and i do not want any more wild turkey, either.  it is burning a hole in my stomach.
okay, okay... I have got some tequila. you want some tequila?
you do?
yeah, you want it?
yeah.
shit.  I am gettin' tired.
are you alright?
i think I have really fucked up.  i think I have got us in a situation where we could both get killed.  why did not we just go straight to the police.
you know why.  you already said.
what did i say again?
nobody would believe us.  we would still get in trouble.  we would still have our lives ruined.  and you know what else?
what?
that guy was hurtin' me.  and if you had not come out when you did, he would a hurt me a lot worse.  and probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  and they woulda made out like i asked for it.  and my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  at least now I am havin' fun.  and I am not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I am only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  and if i haven't, i wanna take this time to thank you, louise.  thank you for savin' my ass.
i said all that?
no, louise, you said the first part. i said all the rest.
whatever.
hey.
how are things goin' out there?
weird.  got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
you are still with us though.  you are somewhere on the face of the earth?
well, we are not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.
you are gettin' in deeper every moment you are gone.
would you believe me if i told you this whole thing is an accident?
i do believe you.  that is what i want everybody to believe.  trouble is, it does not look like an accident and you are not here to tell me about it... i need you to help me here.
no!
you want to come on in?
you know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. so, come out alive?  i do not know. let us think about that.
louise, I will do anything.  i know what is makin' you run.  i know what happened to you in texas.
louise?
yes, thelma?
you are not going to give up on me, are ya?
what do you mean?
you are not going to make some deal with that guy, are you?  i mean, i just wanna know.
no, thelma.  I am not going to make any deals.
i can understand if you are thinkin' about it.  i mean, in a way, you have got something to go back for.  i mean jimmy and everything.
thelma, that is not an option.
but i do not know... something is crossed over in me and i can not go back.  i mean, i just could not live...
i know.  i know what you mean.  i do not wanna end up on the damn geraldo show.
he said they are charging us with murder.
eeuww.
and we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
gosh, did not he say anything positive at all?
louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
sure... you know how to hotwire a car?
no.
well, let me know when you figure it out.
you awake?
you could call it that.  my eyes are open.
me too.  i feel awake.
good.
wide awake.  i do not remember ever feelin' this awake.  everything looks different.  you know what i mean.  i know you know what i mean. everything looks new.  do you feel like that?  like you have got something to look forward to?
we will be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, mamasita.
we can change our names.
we can live in a hacienda.
i wanna get a job.  i wanna work at club med.
yes!  yes!  now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
it would have to be pretty good.
it would have to be pretty damn good.
we should head a little further in. there is not that many roads in this state.  i want to try to hit mexico somewhere not so close to new mexico.  they probably wanna kill us in new mexico.
you are drivin'.
oh my god!  louise!  look!  look! see if that is him!
it is him.  he is got california plates.  it is the same guy.
pass him!
hi!
hi there!  you alright?
we are fine!  how are you?
grrrreat!
where you goin'?
fresno.
we been seein' you all along the way.
yeah.  i been seein' you, too.
what?  what are you talkin' about?
you know good and damn well what I am talkin' about.
i mean really!  that business with your tongue.  what is that?  that is disgusting!
and, oh my god, that other thing, that pointing to your lap?  what is that supposed to mean exactly?  does that mean pull over, i want to show you what a big fat slob i am or...
does that mean suck my dick?
you women are crazy!
you got that right.
I am not apologizing for shit!
say you are sorry.
fuck that.
oh, jesus!
you probably even called us beavers on your cb radio, did not you?
yeah... sure did.
damn.  i hate that!  i hate bein' called a beaver, do not you?
are you going to apologize or not?
fuck you.
hey.  where did you learn to shoot like that?
texas... you were right about what happened to me there.
you know what is happened, do not you?
what?
we have gone insane.
yup.
i guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
yeah, right.  we are not going to get caught.
how far are we from mexico?
about two hundred and fifty miles.
how long do you think that will take?
shit!
did you see that guy?!  he was right in the middle of the road!
shit!
what?!
what?!  what d'you think?!
oh.
we probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
why?
they will probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
i know this whole thing was my fault.  i know it is.
there is one thing you oughta understand by now, thelma, it is not your fault.
louise... no matter what happens, I am glad i came with you.
you are crazy.
you are a good friend.
you too, sweetie, the best.
i guess i went a little crazy, huh?
no... you have always been crazy. this is just the first chance you have had to really express yourself.
i guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
unbearable, I would imagine.
i guess everything we have got to lose is already gone anyway.
how do you stay so positive?
louise!
what?!
what in the hell is that up there?
where?!
way up ahead!
what in the hell is it?!
it is the goddamn grand canyon!
is not it beautiful?!!
it is grand!
god!  it looks like the army!
all this for us?
hey!  do not let them shoot those girls.  this is too much.  they got guns pointed at 'em!
the women are armed, hal.  this is standard.  now you stay calm here. these boys know what they are doin'.
now what?
we are not giving up, thelma.
then let's not get caught.
what are you talkin' about?
go.
go?
I am sorry to bother you, i know you are real busy right now, but how many times, max?  how many times has that woman got to be fucked over? you could lift one finger and save her ass and you will not even do that?
get a hold of yourself!  you are way out of your jurisdiction, now come on!  calm down!  do not make me sorry i let you come!
you are a good friend.
you, too, sweetie, the best.
