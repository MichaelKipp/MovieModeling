mum...  oh mum, god will surely strike us -
wind - i love you with that which is endless within me.  bring me your eyes - your touch - your voice...
parents say he - uh - fell -
anybody got a bp yet...?
- and he seemed okay.  just banged his -
fast.
uh - then he - be just -
he just went out like & light-
massive subdural hamatoma.  we have to evacuat it - right now.
I will tell or we are bringing -
he is herniating!  forget or.  he is dead batore he is oft the elevator get me a trephine tray -  anesthesia - stat!  we need him intubated and blow down!
sooner or later you are going to run out of things to change.  you always do.
i just - hate it when they are - finished.
go back, michael... go back
the door, michael.  find the key...
help us.  do what you can.
go home, stu  I will call you.
bullshit!  let me in!   mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
on which planet...?
you can not just -
go away, goddamnit!
they like you ------- kids.
i guess so.  the trick is remembering how to act like one.  I am glad you called, mr. curry. i wanted to see you.  why do not we go to my office...
I have read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
'freak at the week.'   that is what the tv crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  they have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  they bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so i can teel them where they are..
i do not remember you at all-  you - you saved my life-  bizarre thing to say, is not it...?
I am glad you are around to say it.
my jury's still out on that,
then call it in. mr. curry. whatever's happeninq to you - death is not the preferable alternative.  I am in the life business - remember..?
do they keep everything 'out' ...?
as far as touching things, yes. but the vision - that keeps pouring into my head-    it will not go away god - if i could just understand it.
what do you see...?
nothing.  absolutely nothing-
just one.  the bar's closed.
the one time i want it to work...
you know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
you are not going to give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? my vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
no. I am not.  doctors should be the first ones to admit utter ignorance about some things.
harder...
rowan...
harder!
like this...?  like this...?!
yessssss...
you are very --- different.
I will bet you say that to all the women who bring you back to life and then seduce you.
what else did you see- michael...?
what are you - a mindreader...?  who was the man on the kitchen floor. ~.?
my uncle.  graham.  he and my aunt, ellie raised me.  he - he - had a stroke-  just before ellie died - of cancer. last year.
you knelt there, helpless-  you could not save him.   there was so such anger in you-.   death infuriates you...
it is unbelievable that you can do that.
it - it feels like - like I am being filled up. crowded out of myself.   like I am fading away-
my mother and i used to take long walks and make up stories about the houses and the people who lived inside.  the queen's house-. the gangster's house-. the clown's house- like that.
and whose houses do you design...?
oh. the green underwater ghost's...  the man with the eyes in his hands...
you still feel that crazy...?
i was born, in new orleans, too-
really...?  your family there...?
nope-  my father died before i was born. my mother died in childbirth.   el1ie was my only blood relation.  so she brought me here... the day after i was born.
too much... too fast...?
mm-hmm.     scared-  i feel a little like the moth and the flame.
he is very pleased with your response to the surroundings.
he fools around with his patients too.
you touched him --- and saw him...? what was he doinging.  kinky...?
it is come to that, huh...?  three weeks - and you need a psychic skin flick to perk up our sex life...?
you look very deep when you do that.  it is interesting.  we are complete opposites-  I would never just sit and wait for insparation.  I would skip my turn and swap some letters.
ms. yin, and mr. yang  aha!
y-u-h-e-e-y-a-h.  yu-hee-yah...? no way, busters use it in a sentence.
okay.     you all make sure and come back now, reeeeal soon - yu'heeyah.
why do not you let at do that...?
just sit there and soak up the vitamin d.
doctor's orders- - -?
captain's orders.
far from it, michael... do not put me up there.
all i meant was -
you do not know what you meant -  because you do not know me.
christ, michael - what the hell are we doing...?  we do not even know -
is this the part where you try and talk yourself out of how good this is...?
I am serious.  you do not -
let's see...  next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we are doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you have drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
stop it.
you stop it.  you are loving, and gentel..  you are the most remarkable woman I have ever met --- so stop telling me i do not know what i feel just cause you are scared.  cause it will not work.
seems more like a year than a month.
michael - this place is increadible.  you - you are brilliant...  the things you created...
i called dr. styles at the neurological institute  in l.a., remember...?  he said he would see you.  he was intrigned.
god knows, I am intriguing.
michael, do you want to wear those for the rest of your life...?

you could fly down tomorrow.  i could be there the next day  i think i can last that long without you.
we are quite a pair, you and i.
mad. for each other.
e11ie - diedre died at five of the clock this morning.    obviously, there are 1egal matters.  your discretion will be -
hello...?  who is this...?
who is this...?
rowan mayfair.  who is calling...?
i wish to speak to ellie mayfair.
i beg your par---
when did she die...?
who is this...?
this is your aunt.  carlotta mayfair.  in new orleans.
i do not have any aunts - and I have never heard of a 'carlotta' - or, for that matter - a 'diedre'!  just who -
diedre mayfair was your mother.
my...mother...?
yes.    listen carefully, rowan. have your attorney contact me at once. there are matters of immediate -
but my mother...  ellie said she died -
i under5tand.  all the same
-ellie said she died when i was born!  she is been alive...? all this time...? why have i been lied to when -
i had you sent away.
who the hel1 -
it was quite warranted by the - situation.    i realize this is a shock, but really, rowan - you never even knew her. it is not as if you have suffered some great -
what is the matter with you...?! what kind of person are you...?!
a very tired one.  I have been up all night - and i would .like to rest before the funeral.     have your lawyer -
when is the funeral...?   i am coming to my mother's funeral!!
out of the question      rowan, coming here will not change the -
I am coming down there!!  and it you put my mother in the ground betore i arrive, you will wish you would never seen my face!  is that understood...?!
hello...?
michael!  jesus  I have been trying -
rowan...?
listen.  last night - oh christ, this'1l take forever to explain. god, michael...
what is wrong..?
michael - i have to go - to new orleans. I will - I will call yati when i -
what about you coming down here...?
go to lax and get on a flight to new orleans.  go to the ponchartrain hotel and wait for me.  I will call you there.
wait a minute.  rowan - what is going on...?
goodbye, michael.   i love you.
harder...
rowan...
harder...
like this...  like this...?
yessss...
always loved you. rowan.  always...
rowan - I am beatrice maytair.  your cousin.  deedee...you'r mother and i - we - we grew up together.
i want to see my mother.
you came.    I am your aunt carlotta, my dear.
i want to see my mother.  where is she...?
in the coffin, my dear.  where else...?
down here. darling, we figure: if you are taking a trip to god knows where - might as well have one hell of a going-away party.
in certain cases, hell is the operative word.
giff - shuttup.    you are mother was a sweet child, rowan... a lost little girl in a world too full at things
jesus I have got - to get to the ho--
rowan's already called the hotel, michael.  at the cemetery by now, i would guess.
how do you know about rowan ...?  i did not --- cemetery...?
with her family.  rowan's mother died yesterday.
rowan's mother died at childbirth. and she does not have. any family.
i ask only that you stay here, long enough to be - educated.  a few hours.
you sound certifiable. yon know that.
i - r saw him as a child.  lots of times...  but no one else did.
come.  there is a lot to read
she was alive all these years... you never let me know her. who gave you that right...?!
a mayfair it ever i saw one.
i might as well be rowan smith - or jones!   you cut me off from every -
I am tired.  i need to rest.
there are things i have to know!
i do not want the -
other properties as well - here and in europe.  and vest holdings - in sugar, oil, gold, electronics.  liquid funds over eighty million.  tmpcssible to put a figure on it all. all yours now.
eighty million doll --- ?
and this - if you decide to take the rest.
what is it...?
the lamplight.  that is all.
you can see well in the dark, rowan.
better than most, i suppose.
put your hatred for me aside, so you can clearly see what is ahead-
you kept her in this filth in restraints...?.
she did not feel them
you are a monster.
antha...your grandmother...her life ended there, on the stones. head split open like a melon.
why are you doing this...?  handing out these horrors! why...?!!
you have the mayfair eyes.   tell me, rowan --- what have those eyes seen that the mind can not fathom...?
he is shown himself to you... on the deck.  in the storm.
'he'...?
lasher touched you and you loved it.
it wes a dream...!
just like your mother - and all the others that felt him - and used his power - and went to hell with a smile!
stop it!
witches. rowan.  that is what we are.
enough!!!
and that is why i pushed your grandmother onto the stones - even as she had him inside her...
you are mad!  your mind is sick!
...and why i put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. to kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
you - are - a - murderer.
but i had to use my hands.  none before you could kill with their mind.  graham, my dear.  your uncle...?
did you like it...? looking down at graham and knowing what you could do...?
I am not like you!  I am not! you are cruel -
you know...?
i know.  it is not possible --- but i know.
she - she said i - i was a ---
- a witch.
it could have been a tornado - or a - a hurricane.  maybe -
michael - i saw him!  twice!  carlotta said i  ---  killed graham - with - with my anger.
ro - you can not really believe that. nobody can murder someone with their feelings.  i mean --- that is crazy.
is it more or less crazy than dying and coming back to life with hands that can see...?  god, michael --- what am i...?
c'mon.  let's go to the ho---
he is in there!  or are you out for a stroll in the garden ...?!  where are you, goddamnit...?!
even if it is all true - that does not make you a witch! it is 1992, rowan!
but it scares the hell out of you, does not it. michael...?
many times over the past thirty years. why he shows himself to me, i do not know but lasher's not some mindless wraith.
then what is he...?
a spacial entity.  an organized energy.  something that precedes our definition of existence.
a what...?
a spirit.  perhaps evil...   ...and he has come to you- with diedre gone - you've... inherited him.
stop looking at me like that! I am not some siren chanting to the moon.  and my life is not a cosmic whim!  i am in charge of my life -  - and i want to stay.  everything that was taken from me is here, michael. all these years, she was there without me.  helpless. i should have been here.
rowan...   think of what is in that book.  think of last night!
i am!   and so are you.  you thought you would found yourself a nice, sensible doctor. pause)  michael, if you do not want -
do you love me, michael...?
yes.  i love you.  very much.
I have come home, michae1, for the first time.  i want to stay here - with you.
going away does not mean you leave lasher behind. he was on rowan's deck - and the plane...  geography seems irrelevant now.
michael - you loved that house as a child.  you could work again! you could make it ours. we will sweep out the horror.  and lasher with it!
it would take mounths... and cost a fortune.
I am soon to be a very wealthy witch.
what about your work back home...?
they need doctors in new orleans too.   michael - think what i could do with the money!
well, normie - you will not have to worry about this one being finished for a lonnnnng time.  how are the hands...?
the guy i told you about - aaron...?  he says i can learn to control them. that i could lose the gloves at some point.
'leave bees be - and the bees be nice.' did not your father ever teach you that...?
that is a wasp.  fuckers'll sting a tree if they are bored-  so - where is she...?
wow...
if you like that type.
rowan mayfair.
sut mckinley.  marry me.
i thought you were almost engaged, stu...?
you really love this guy...?
he is got great hands.
hey - i love gloves-  i look really great in gloves.
i like him.  he can stay.
I will bet she had a wonderful smile.
let's see.
you sure...?
it is the next best thing to being there' - right...?
i hope ryan explained that if you stay in this town, you are shackled with pushy relations for the rest of your life.
he made that quite clear, yes.
gifford - that box glued to your hands...?
are not they gauche...?   those steel things are so - common.
nothing worse than a common tool.
everyone - this is michael curry.
hello..
michael - this is beatrice mayfair. and this is her brother, giff---
you two sees like a perfect fit.   only two mounths...?
mm-hmm.    seems & lot longer.
in the bayou, they have a saying... 'you choose the music for the dance - but fortune picks your partner.'   darling, I would say you are on a roll.
I am wondering why the hell he has not shown up.
he can not hurt us, michael.  it is us - our love.  he can not find a crack in it.  he can not find a way in.
maybe he is just - waiting...
if we married, we would shut him out forever.
ro, how long have we known each other.
i do not think of us that way - ever.
either do i.    i love you, ro.  you know that. you are a total mystery to me - but i love you.
than letts get rnarried, michael.  i could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
you are a ve-ry bad witch, you know that...?
no, I am ve-ry good --- and you aught to know.
we would better get to work on the papers.
papers...?
standard for a mayfair marriage.  rowan - there is a codicil concerning the mayfair assets. they must be... aahhh... held separate from the other party... michael  that is it is in the will - for centuries.  tradition enjoins, rowan.   of course, future earnings from your practice will not fall into -
I have decided not to open a practice here  i want to set up a research clinic.  for infant genetic disorder.
that is new territory for us...but yes, we can look into that.  explore shelter possibilities, funding bodies. we could -
no tax shelters.  no funding.  i want to fund the clinic - exclusively.  the diedre mayfair research clinic.  I would like to find an existing building and move in immediately - while we draw up plans for new construction.
that would mean liquidating sizable amounts of cash.
i plan on liquidating almost evetything.
no scaredy-cats in the talamasca, huh...?
there is a difference between sensing danger - and being afraid.  what defines you in the landscape, michael...?  what anchors your life...? your work...?  your creativity...?
rowan.
then focus on how you feel about her. because your feelings define you.   take off your gloves, michael.
smoking is bad for your heart, michael.
hey - I am getting married in the morning - i already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, doctor.
you are just afraid I will drop dead before i finish the damn house.
and i thought i was the mindreader.
i took off my gloves today - with aaron -  - and it was okay.
that is great!
guess so.    i keep thinking about the witches - when i was... down there    there was - caring.  they saved me, ro.  they said 'go back'...  wel1-  i came back - to you - to love you.  i like seeing it that way, y'know...?
are not we supposed to love somebody for their moral rectitude or their courage or their beneficence -
their what...?
so how come i love you most when you stick your finger in your chin...?
wanna snack...?
a little wine...?
you do not love michael   how can you love - if you lie...?
lie...?
there are things you will not tell him.
hey - you are bleeding.
dropped it.
you okay...?
just nervous.  getting married, you know.     got the rings...?
always give the crovd a taste, darling.  now - ryan said I am supposed to make sure -
i do not want it.
'the heir to the fortune must wear the mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  we should all have to suffer such burdens.
then you wear it.
c'mon now - give a little nod to mayfair tradition.
thank you for this honor, my dear.
you have been shadowing the family for thirty years.  it is only fitting you give one af us away.
I have grown very fond of you you and michael both.
you babbling that nonsense - now...? this is a wedding.
I am not saying i believe it...but i heard it 'nough times to know somebody did.   they made a deal with the devil.  y'know - "make us rich" - worship the number thirteen - the whole bit.  and some stuff about 'bringing them all back through a door...'
gifford mayfair - I will cook your tongue on a spit!    witches!
hell - julien believed it... carlotta too... and god knows, more than a few of us called her a witch!
i have seen him again.  last night.
but you have not told michael.
lasher will act, rowan.  whatever it is he wants - he is waited three hundred years to have it.   facing him alone...  i do not like -
lasher is my legacy - not michael's.   aaron, I have seen the pain in michael.  i can not bear to see anymore.   he is not to know.  swear to me.
yes, michael.  harder--.  more...
like this...?
i am with you, my love. like no other can ever be.
nooo...  no!  stop!
stop!
always loved you..
you look a little green.
mm-hmmm...
maybe the shrimp you bad last night.
mm-hmm...
gee - look at that.  i did not know alligators came this far up on shore
mm-hmm...
nobody makes a car like them nasis...
did you see the old man on the ---
michael!
no - i did not kill him.   would you rather I would let them kill us - after they would raped me...?
no.    this is unreal...
it is not some fairytale in an old book.    michael - look at me.  i did not choose this, michael.  this is who i am.  i love you.
i love you too.
fall in new orleans...  this whole town is waterlogged!  the matches, the wood, my clothes, my skin.
that is cause we are below sea level.
rowan we are below sea level. I have spent time there myself.
that is not funny.
you did that, did not you...?
talking to me dear...?
remember the first time we made love - and then ---
- we made a fire.
michael - what made you fall in love with me...?
your beneficence.
I am serious.    whatever it was - it is still there inside me, is not it - change and all...?
i thought it was 'whistle while you work.
is that a crack about our singing...?
is that what you were doing...?
you alright...?
a little sore.  darm...   finish up my section, will ya...?
is he - is he gonna die...?
lock the door.  lock it
michael - why would he want to hurt stu...?
i do not know.
the wasps were meant for michael - but there is only so much you can control, is not there?  the great and powerful lasher - undone by a faulty ladder-..  why would you hurt him...?!  answer me.
i 1ove you, rowan.  I have always loved you.  i only wanted to be in your thoughts. to bring myself into your thoughts - so i could be as we are now.
you violated me!!!  on my wedding night!
explain this to me --- violated...?
you bastard...
made it...?
it is from love.
to love, you must be able to feel.
if you knew how i yearn for that...
if i could feel like you feel...but i have only others' feelings - . . like breeres that blow through me.  things to be felt, yes --- but not nine to feel...
it you harm michael, i will let my anger loose.  and you will feel that. do you understand...?

you are very clever, are not you...?
i am only what you are --- what all of you have been.   what do you think of yourself now, my love...?
I am sure he is alright, bea. they will find him somewhere.
it is over a month.    the police say it happens all the time.
are you alright...?  you look pale.
i wish everyone would stop commenting on my health.  I am the doctor.
there are two.
two what...?
two heartbeats.
if it is a boy --- taylor.
a bit much.    lucas.
nah - i had a shmuck of an uncle named lucas.    grayson.
where are you gitting these...?  aaron --- if it is a boy.
I am going to have a baby.   michael wants to name it after you - if it is a girl.  diedre mayfair curry. pretty, huh...?  funny --- i never really thought I would ever ---
i bring her flowers too.
there is no one here but the dead.
go away!  i do not want you here.
if that were true, i would not be here.
it is very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
from the night on the moor, when i was swept into the world and first knew this exquisite pain - it is a mayfair who has wanted me!  suzann. and deborah.  stella - marguerite - antha  - diedre -  all of them.  and you will have a child...
a girl...?
it is too soon to know.
you crave what i might show you.  what you can learn.  what i can give you.  so much more than michael can.
what michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
but i could understand. i want to understand!
i love him!
do not tell me that!
i love michael.  michael!!
michael...  do what you can.
michael...  help us...  the door!
do not tell rowan about this.
michael, rowan should -
no!  she is pregnant, aaron.  she is got that to deal with - and the clinic.. she is not to hear about this.   do not you think i know she spends half her lite worrying about me...  listening to my heart, are not you...?  the timex still ticking...?
I am getting --- left behind.
left behind...?  this about rowan...?
yes.   partly.  it is - it is -  stu - do you believe in ---
when aid you get home last night...?
what were you talking about...?
yyou look terrible.  you are exhausted. you practically live at the goddamn clinic.    even pregnant women who are not doctors know that you can not -
dovetails.  gotta be a hundred years old.
go ahead.
something is wrong with you.
nothing is wrong with me.  i know something is in there - and so do you.
what have the witches always asked of you...?
"go back, michael.  do what you can..."
yes - and you have.  do you see...?  he was passing over into death - but the witches sent him back - to the one person they knew had the power to save him... and they gave him the power to show you what no one else could...
with his hands!
but why would they do that...?
you have always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and rowan together.  is not that right...?  they are reaching out to you, rowan!
but it does not make sense.  they - they used lasher...  they conspired with him.
who can say the hope of redemption dies with our last breath...? they must see what the legacy has wrought - diedre, withered inside herself carlotta, killing and stunting her own flesh and blood...  surely they sense the child you carry - and the life it might lead in lashers grasp...   maybe, in death, they feel remorse for the evil they embraced in life...?!
i know that you are evil.
i only wanted to see as others do... feel as others do...  ...but marguerite could not help me.  nor julien...
and now you expect me to stockpile corpses for you...?!
no, my love.  i want nothing more of the dead.  i want you to --- chang me.
I have waited for you - the one whose science could match her powers...  do you know what it is like - to sense the majesty of something so sublime just beyond your reach...?  to float in a dream that keeps a .promise half-hidden in its shadows.-.?  i did not choose to be such as this!  suzanne brought me here.  she called to me!
but have i...?  ever...?!
--- and i have heard you from the beginning... from it is very first beat.
i love michael...
then help me--- for his sake...
you must not hurt him. must not - must not hurt..
focus all your powers on me, rowan until it is done. only me...
only you...
change me, rowan, and we can change everything...
a few hours and I will be wasting away in margaritaville.  oh, sweet decadance.
just do not fall off any ladders.
mikey - pregnant women get crazy you know that.  i mean - hell, they are all crazy anyway - right...?
comes running out the front door - down the walk to them. michael seems to pull inside himself. cool.  aloof.
hi.
hi.    you - you wanna get some breakfast...?  maybe see a movie...?
i - i...  i can't, michael.  there is stuff --- at the clinic -
gotcha.
go on. rowan.  go on.
leave me alone!
what is wrong...?
wrong...?  science is not magic.
i do not understand...
you went into the cells --- and you changed them.  how...?!
there was no thought.  there was no act.    that is not what i am.
i do not know what you are!!!
that is what you must discover.   see what i am, my love. with all your power - see me, and know what i am.
no!
tell me what i am, rowan.
you have gone away from me, ro...  someplace i do not know how to get to.
it is not true.  you have to believe me.
i can't.
that is not good enough.  why not...?!
i can not leave now.  do not ask me to explain!  i just can't!
I have never asked you to explain yourself - because you used to let me inside!  but I am on the outside now...  you put me there!
michael - please -  just. a little longer.  do not leave.
why bother to ask, ro...?  why do not you just make me stay,..?
stop it!
how 'bout a backward hex with a three-quarter twist...?
you bastard!
you could kill me - right now, could not you...?  could not you...?!  tell me the truth --- is it lasher...?  answer me!!
michael - I am sorry...  just give me -
no.
on't know what else to do.  maybe i just do not belong in her life.  well - I am already out of her life.
nothing was ever more false.
then tell me.  is it lasher....
I will probably be back in a week...but i can not spend christmas in that house.   you will check on her - every day...?
every day  twice.
aaron - lieten to me...  it is been lasher - from the start!
what are you talk---
he chose me for rowan --- when i was a child!
rowan...
you have to warn her - this second! I am catching the next flight back!
aaron was in the dream.  a dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, did not you...?
it was an accident.   gifford, too.
the portraits, lasher.  why are the witches always before a door...? tell me, lasher.  now!
they want to come back.    we have a pact - of mutual desire and  consent.  the mayfairs ar. a beautiful tapestry.  i have weaved you all together - from the start.   i brought petyr van abel to suzanne.  he had genius in him.  scientific, precise.  it was a perfect start. and on  it has gone - father to mother... sister to brother... father to daughter...
oh god...
ju1ien was your father   your great-grandfather - your grandfather - and your father. all one in the same...  that is why he fought carlotta for your life.
put - him - down!  his - his heart...
