man, that is one george michael notch from being gay.
dude, get wisdom. we are about to board a seven hour flight. the toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. what if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in christa or blake?  you want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
fag.
c'mon, man, like you really thought you were going to tittie fuck 'em over greenland, or something?
because of you, i got to sit here and watch fuckin' "stepmom."
I will remove him.
fuck you! I will remove myself!
and then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. the the whole plane... blew up. it was so real. exactly how everything goes.
been on many planes that blew up, have you?
you are payin' for my trip, browning!
i wish you were on the plane!
how would i know? you think I am some sort of...
he is not a witch.
i got this... feeling... a weird feeling... i can not explain it...
did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. sleeping pills?
no. i saw it. i saw it!
hope you do not think, browning, that because my name am not on this wall... that i owe you anything.
i don't.
all i owe is these people.  to live my life to the fullest.
me, too.  but my dad does not understand. when he is better; you and me, road trip to the city. catch the yanks.
that is a plan.
it is only the end of june.
yeah, but everything's always in transition. if you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel autumn coming.  almost like bein' able... to see the future.
you went there? I have wanted to go there, but i thought it was off limits.
it is. but that did not stop me. should not stop you.
not a likeness. it is how you make me feel, alex.
i'm... really sorry.
like you, the sculpture does not even know what, or why, it is. reluctant to take form. and, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction.
that is why i was there last night.
I have never dealt with death before. i was not alive when my grandparents died. i wish i could know. i mean, all this... could just be in our heads. now it feels like it is everywhere.
"it?"
what if tod... is just the first... of us?
is that something you are "feeling?"
i do not know. i wish i could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  i would know.
then, let's go see him!
this place?!
doin' somethin' I am not supposed to.
that... him?
i think. but why did they make him up like... michael jackson?
that is him, but... he is not here.
ahhh! fuck! you fucking asshole. you think this is funny, you fucking dick? tod, if you are not dead I am going to fucking kill you!
ohmygod! ohmygod!  ohmygod!  he is not dead?
i'm... a friend of his. his best friend. see, his father...
i know who you are.
cuticle lacerations.
why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
his father's pretty fucked up with denial. maybe he could not deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
in death...
... there are no accidents. no coincidencess. no mishaps.  and no... escapes.
you saying tod did kill himself?
you may not realize it, but we are all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or will not with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
design?
I am sorry we broke in.
no harm. no foul.
he said death has a design. even before he said that i had been seeing patterns.
as in flannels and plaids?
how many died on flight 180?  from our group?
thirty-nine.
remember the gate number?
no.
thirty-nine.
remember the departure time?
like... 4:25.
4:25.
right. april 25th.
wait. i thought you meant the time of your birth. four/twenty-five, as in, month and day... that is a reach.
I am not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I am talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. that, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
that is total bullshit. you can find death omens anywhere you want to.
i do not understand... did you see tod die? did it happen again, like on the plane?
no, but it might as well be the same thing. this was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. but here... you are suggesting tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active presence.
we are losing our favorite teacher.
look, there is something you should all know.
i believe that... ms. lewton's next.
"next?"
yes... see, there is this... pattern... that is occuring.
oh, you have noticed it, too?
alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
no... i can't. as long as I am in here, it is outta my control.
what are you doing?
terry's name should be on this wall.
so, why did you want us to meet you here? now?
they are watching me, see if i go to alex.
and do not pass on the right.
billy! I am gettin' a vision!  you are the next one...
hey, man, why did you say that?!
'cause if you say another word, I am going to fuckn' kill ya!
most kids do, i guess.
most kids never have it happen.
those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
no.. i mean, i do not have anything on me. this will not be safe.
nothing is... anymore.
i can not go home. after lewton's, they will be after me.
we are takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it is only a couple miles from my house.  keep off the highways, they will be lookin' for us.
alright, browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about ms. lewton, or what?
why do you think i was hiding?
billy told the f.b.i. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
they blame me for everything. her, tod, the plane crash...
please tell me I am going to get to see the jets win the super bowl.
me, right? that is why you are not saying.
shoulda' felt up tammy in the pool, that time...
whatta' you whinin' about? he said I am next.
he did not say nothin'. just drive.
you have a responsibility to tell me.
is knowing going to make it easier? it makes it harder.
you get off havin' control over me. let me choose how to deal with it.
it does not matter who is next... we are all on the same list.
knock it off!
may as well go out under my own free will, right?
not with us in the fuckin' car!
what is your fuckin' worry? if it is not your time...? i could get nailed runnin' this red light and you all would not get shit! only me, right?
no!
get control of yourself!
that is what I am doin'!
i know what you are doing!  it is alright to be scared, carter. you do not have to prove to us how big your balls are. not now.
I am not afraid! i decide when it is time! i control my life! i control my death!
stop the car!
let us out!
can not you open the door?!
easy, billy, just open it.
carter, get out!
do not do it! do not do it!
get out! get out of the car!  get out of the fuckin' car!
get out! get out of the car!
it broke!
no one's that strong.
shut up, billy!
we do not need this now!
you should have been next. after lewton, you should have been next. that is the only pattern. you should be dead.
you are the fuckin' devil.
but i saved him. i intervened. just like the plane. that is the design.
police are coming.
that is why it skipped carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; billy.
my intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
"intervention?" what are you, god now?!
of course not! gods are not afraid to die! gods do not die! we do!
you know what to do.
no! no! don't!
when i do this.. it will have skipped you... and it will all be over.
