I am not hungry.
well it is fixed, so you will have to eat it.
no, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
what is the matter with you?
what is this?  why did you change it?
you have seen enough.
you know i do not feel well.
eat your dinner.
yes.
....going well.  how could i be so wrong.  sco 1202 cross wired a 904.  he is been receiving extra credit.  he offered me some.
yes
i did not accept any.  i...  i wanted... to.  but i didn't. you know i didn't.  do not you?
yes.
my mate has been acting very strange.  i can not explain it.....but.  i have not been feeling very well myself.  i do not know, maybe it is me.  i needed an sp9 last night.  i feel as if something odd were happening to me. something....
yes.
i can not understand.  the sedatives....
....i'm taking sp5, but it does not seem strong enough.  i have a hard time concentrating.  please forgive me, i slipped on....
you are a true believer.  blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  thou art a subject of the divine.  created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
what did you get?
i have to see sen.  I have just been given a shift change.
when?
now.
now?
he wants me to come to his quarters.
a shift change should come through the scheduling office.
i do not know.
do not go.
i have to... he is a g-34
you do not have to... i do not trust him.  you ought to file a report.
no, do not make trouble.  it is nothing.
then why did you bring it up?
i didn't.  you asked me about the card.  you are going to get us into trouble.
i have not done anything.
do not be so sure.
I am sure it is warmer in her than outside, though.  i have not been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled...
where is luh?
what?
why did you have luh come here?
why are you so concerned?
what is going on?
i want you for my roommate.
where is luh?
it will be good for both of us. I have got it all arranged.
i do not understand. living....selection is computed. you can't... what have you done to luh?  she was here..
we had a long talk and she agreed that it would be a good idea for you to switch.  she felt that you had not been accurately mated to her in the first place... you are upsetting yourself.  would you like something?
you are in violation.
do not say that.  you look...  you are not well.
i will not have another mate like ona.  you rate very high in sanitation.  I have checked.  in fact, i am surprised that you were ever matched with luh.  her ratings are very erratic - you know what i mean.  we will be happy.
i do not feel well.
....with me?  what am i to her or she to me?  nothing.  she is an ordinary roommate.  i..i share...
yes...
...rooms with her.  our relationship is normal, conforming.  we share nothing but space.  what is she doing to...
yes...
...to me.  i think I am dying.
I have never been under the table before.
look,dirt!
that is not dirt...can't be dirt.. dirt is a violation.
looks like dirt.
look, food!
that is not food.  can not be food.
looks like food.
now...now, I am sorry...don't - don't....please.  it is just... i was happy.  why get me involved? you told sen that you were not satisfied with me.
what?...oh, no, thx.  that is not true.  not satisfied?  thx, i need you so much.
i was so scared...i did not know what would happen with you...once i started.  i almost let you go on so many times.  it will be worth it, together.  when i was alone, i knew.
but it is so hopeless...you're so beautiful.
what time is it?
what?
i said what time is it?  how long was i out?
it is 3+27 hundred
three!  I am going to be late for my shift.
no!  do not go.
they will come for me right away if I am not there.  i have to go.
do not take anything.
I will try.
promise...please do not thx leaves the room.
what are you doing here?  is anything wrong?
no....i though  I am afraid.
you are not cleared for this precinct.  let's cross over first.
you slipped on a t297 transfer just before lunch, did not you?
what?
on the cervix transfer, you almost lost the t297.
what do you think you are doing? you are going to get us arrested.
but...you...
i can not go on like this.  i can't....  i do not just sit around and watch people.  if i make a mistake, it is all over.  you see it every day.  do you want to see me taken away in pieces?
i do not want to lose you.
what are you doing?
i do not know.
if you....if you go back on sedation, you will not feel the same way about me.  you will report me for drug evasion.
I have got a slip movement to install on my next shift.  I will never make it the way i am now.
i could not turn you in, not now. i....i know i wouldn't!
you do not know.  you don't....
if i take something, you suffer. if i don't, i stuff....
i know you can do it without sedation, you can, i know you can.
then what?  it can not go on forever. you know it can't.
we could leave, and live in the superstructure....
it is all right now, shhhh it is all right.
do not let them separate us.
are you all right?
ah ugh.
they know.  they have been watching us.  i can feel it.
they do not know.
they are watching us now.
no one can see us now we are alone.
what are you doing here?  you are not cleared for this area!
you know i have a way with the computers.  i can clear myself for any area.....almost.
I will report you.  it's....
listen to me....you have no need to distrust me.  we are going....
get out of here, leave me alone.
i can not hear him.
cortex bonding....possible temporary.  before you report a possible equipment malfunction, you check the subjects....?
stress category.
correct.  origin?
birth born....ummm...sexact.
violation?
drug evasion with....
triple three, triple three! easy.....
drug evasion with assorted perversions
correct.  now secure a sinex drop reading.
a sinex drop reading of less then 2000 degrees with an accompanying loss of greater then 350 degrees since admission may indicate....?
permant cortex bond.
correct.
hummmm.....
what happened?
see if you can get a reading on tactal retention.  try to estimate it without a meter reading.
hurry up.
4732...?
too low.
control on.
no, evidently you reversed the polarity on his lobal travel. secure another sinex drop.
4000 degrees is usually the point of....?
vocasity
no, tetanty.
no...no, no.
oh, thx... hold me, hold me, thx holds her tightly, tears in his eyes.  they kiss, and luh hides her head in thx's chest.
it is the end.
I am not afraid...i'm not afraid.
it is wrong; so wrong, what we have done....
thx!
no!...no!...
then why are they holding us here? why do not they destroy us right away?  economically, it is not sound at all.  very much unlike....
I have said many times before, and i guess I will have to repeat it again for your...
you always manage to avoid the issue:  what is wrong with our present condition?  we are comfortable and we have plenty of food...i feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. why incite trouble?  you should examine your emotions.  it is senseless...
what are you talking about? when did you sleep last?  do you know what your trouble is? you are blind.  you have been here so long you can not see what is happening.  we must unite.  we need unity.  we need action. ) we have come to a time when we must....
i can just barely see him.  i think he is leaving.
impossible!
i can not see him at all.  he is been destroyed.
no, look!  three degrees from the central azimuth.
he is coming back for the rest of us.  he can not make it alone.
i wonder how far he went.  he is gathered invaluable information out there.
how far did you go?  was it cold?
you have nothing to fear.  you are safe again.
wait!  I will talk to him.
ask him about the air.  he looks out of breath.
i thought you were through with it!
we cannot stay here and allow ourselves to be destroyed.  you can work with us.  an organized plan of escape must be devised first.  could you see anything?  you want to leave.  you are not like them.  you must have left something, or someone.
but we need a creative dissent. our voices are not joined in any harmonious chorus, but the differences are differences of emphasis, not of fundamentals. now, the new alignment's greatest need is to communicate with all its elements, rather than march along in parallel line that never converge.  tomorrow as we focus the new movement more clearly, we will gain a new unity.
what?
good lord!
a shelldweller.  they live in the outer shell of the city.  quite unique, there have been two here before.  they smell.
well?
out of a random selection of 150 locations with 150 possible sightings, there were 146 absolute negatives and four conditionals, most of which occurred in the early familiarization stages of the experiment and can be largely discounted.
not very encouraging.
on the contrary!  it absolutely proves what i have always felt. we are located in an apparently uniform space with no visible limits.  we are just now beginning to push back the clouds of ignorance and perceive the truth.  we must continue the search.
I have got it!  astounding!
what?
no one could have imagined anything one-thousandth as fantastic as the sober facts uncovered by patient inquiry.  this world is in a state of static-mobility:  we are at the same time moving and standing still.
that is the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard.
it may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind, but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design.
there goes another of your disciples.
it seems i am destined to endure many frustrations....but at the same time i am secure in the knowledge that the thrust of my studies has been in the right direction, and that even if it remains incomplete, my search has not been in vain.
I am leaving.
what?
I am leaving.
when?.....how?
right now.
but you can't...you.
what is going on....what are you doing?
we are leaving.
what?
we are leaving.
who?  who is leaving?
thx and me.
but you can't.  we must escape.
we must escape.  we have plans. we can leave.  we must wait until...
incredible!
what?
look!
what are you doing here?
i was lost.
...and you are not lost now?
no, i...
which way?
that way.
how do you know?
look more closely.
we have lost sen!
what?
lost sen!  he will never find us.
too late....stay close.
...it does not matter.  the rest of it just did not happen.
what are you talking about. how do you know?  i need her!  i need her.  she needs me.  I have got to get to her.
maternity ward, huhh!
we will never make it through that mainway...i wonder what happened to sen.  I am crazy!  this whole thing is crazy...what am i doing?  my mind is full of so many things i can not think of anything, anymore.  who are you?
who?  me?...i do not know.
what kind of answer is that?
i do not know.
you have to!....i'm 1138 thx magnum manipulator 347 cell 94107 precinct 3 residence:  level 6421 complex 12 ramp 5.  roommate 3417 lu...h.
oh, that!  I am 5555 srt entron..
i do not care.
you are engaged in an unauthorized procedure.  check cybernetic manual f-45.  if you do no have an f-45, you are in violation.  this is a double a restricted precinct. remain where you are.  authorities will arrive shortly.
you should know better than that!
what was that....
must be an expressway.... you do not have to stay here, you know....
what have you done, cut your hand?
I am all right thx rises and they begin to walk along the passageway. at the end of the hall is a small metal door, a sign read "level 842con g, division of plastic, vendable manufacturing stations" the door is jammed and it is difficult to open.  finally the latch snaps and the door swings open.
would you like part of this? ....it's not much.
all the insides are gone!
this one has eyes.  why did they leave your eyes? could you ever....
no!....
i knew him.
soon he will be a plastic cube.
shut up.
that is not it.
no?
she is not there
no......  she is dead thx........
you do not know that!
all right...
remember this...?
where is luh?
look more closely.
no...no you are wrong.
I am only trying to help you.
I am sorry.
what do you want?
save yourself....
just look at all those people.
i thought of something.....
