you are awake.  can you hear me?  you have been shot.  I am trying to help you.  you were in the water.  you have been shot.  it is okay now.
where am i?
you are american.  i thought so. from your teeth -- the dental work --
where am i?
you are on a boat.  a fishing boat. italian flag.  we are out of vietri.  it is the cold that saved you.  the water.  the wounds are clean.  I am not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  it is clean.
how did i get here?
you we are lost at sea.  they pulled you out.  who are you?  you were shot -- two bullets -- in the back.  you understand me?  who are you?
what if it does not come back?
i told you.  you need to rest.
it came from your hip.  under the skin.  you have a bank in zurich.  you remember zurich?
no.
look, I am just on this boat, okay? I am an engineer.  whatever this is, it is not for me to be involved, okay?
i do not remember zurich.
you drink rum?
i do not know.
it is not much, but it should get you to switzerland.
i will not forget this.
what?
abbott wants to talk.
tell him we are busy.
i tried.
storm clouds are gathering, ted. it looks like rain and i do not have a thing to wear.
i do not know what we are talking about.
we are talking about marseille. we are talking about nykwana wombosi. and I am asking you if this abortion in marseille has anything to do with treadstone.  was this treadstone?
you are asking me a direct question?
yes.
i thought you were never going to do that.
they are putting together an agency oversight committee.  they are going to look through everyone's budgets. treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  what am i going to do about that?
you would want to make that go away. you would want to remind them that treadstone is a training organization.  that it is all theoretical.  you would want to sign off on that.
and what if i could not do that?
then I would have to explain treadstone. and you would have to explain how you let me get this far.  does not sound like much of a plan-b, does it?  we will clean up the field.  you clean up your budgets.
miss kreutz, please... I am going to have to ask you to keep your voice down.
all the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- i brought all the papers --
miss kreutz, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the united states --
you only know that because i told you!  ask the case officer -- find his name -- it is on the papers -- i told him all this myself! --
-- it is not the source of the information that is important here --
-- i paid this fucking guy -- i paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- i told this to the case officer last week...  ...here -- mr. thomas.  i told mr. thomas i did not know this guy was already married -- i admitted this!
-- miss kreutz, please --
-- I am the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the united states government -- me -- I am the one being ripped off!
so now you are asking for a student visa?
-- and they are sure it is him? --
-- he accessed the account --
-- but it was him --
-- yes, sir, it is confirmed --
you are a u.s. citizen?
yes.  i mean, i think so.  yes.  yes...
well, either you are, or you aren't.
right.
you have your passport?
i have a passport.  I have got...  actually, it is a little complicated.
do you have your passport, sir?
look, maybe i should just...
sir, you waited on line.
yeah, i know...
-- what are you talking about? --
-- we are evacuating the building --
-- we are in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- call the code! -- i want everyone out! --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
-- he is running from the cops, he is got a bag filled with god knows what, he is in the building and i do not know where! --
i need a ride.

i need a ride out of here.
oh, jesus...
please.  i do not want to scare you.
it is a little late for that.
I have got a situation here and --
get the fuck away from my car.
I will give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to paris.
great.  you know what?  I will give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before i start screaming my head off.
you do not want the police any more than i do.
jesus...
get me out of here.  please.
what?
zurich police are looking for an american with a red bag.  apparently he put two cops in the hospital last night.
what the fuck is he doing?
maybe it is a game.  maybe he is trying to send us a message.
it does not matter now.  we have just got to be the first ones there.  get everybody up.  i want them all activated.
all of them?
so what is in paris?
i want to go home.
for twenty thousand dollars.
i said ten thousand.
you have blood on your pants.
okay.  twenty thousand.  ten now.  ten there.
no.  no, that was too easy --
wait up --  -- just wait up --
-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, i mean give me a fucking break with this, this is --
look, i want a ride to paris.  that is all i want.  i swear.
you swear?  that is great.  i feel so much better now.
i do not want anything but a ride. all i want to do is go home.
you could buy a car for twenty grand.  you could buy this car.
i do not want to go alone.  i want you to drive me to paris.  like we are a couple.  like we are a couple and we are travelling together.  that is all we are doing.
and i do not get hurt.  i get twenty thousand dollars and i do not get hurt.
i will not hurt you.
what if i say no?
then I will find another ride.
just so you know, if you are going to burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  i was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  it is not my car.
i know that.
shit --  can i tell you how much you are freaking me out?  okay?  because you are -- you are completely freaking me out.
I am sorry.  really.  what do you want me to do?
i do not know.  smile.  sneeze. something.  you have got a bag full of money and a ride to paris.  fuck it, i do not know...  what kind of music do you like?
i do not know.
what does that mean?
listen to what you want.
who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to paris?
i do not know.  i do not know who i am.
yeah, well, welcome to the club.
no.  no, i mean, i really do not know who i am.  i can not remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  I am serious.
what?  like amnesia?
look, go ahead...put the radio on...
amnesia?  you are saying you do not remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
that is what I am saying.

and you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
no.
when you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
nothing.  it is just not there.
well, this is great.  I am sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
i kept trying things, i thought if i could find all the things i could do, i could --
-- you could put it together --
-- which was okay for a while, i was okay with it...  but then -- there is all these other things -- all these other things i know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  i think something bad happened.
what are you talking about?
i do not know.
sounds like you were in an accident or something.
i was shot twice in the back.
okay, so you are a victim.
there was a gun.  who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
lots of people have guns.  you are american.  americans love guns.
i fought my way out of an embassy. i climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- i went out the window and i was doing it -- i just did it.  i knew how to do it.
people do amazing things when they are scared.
why do i? -- i come in here -- instinctively -- first thing i do -- I am looking for the exit -- I am catching the sightlines -- i know i can not sit with my back to the door --
you are paranoid.  you were shot. it is natural.
and that is the best angle of the courtyard?
that is the only angle.
what do they have on the streets? the area.  they must have something.
hang on...
what?
abbott.  he knows about the embassy. he is coming down for a show and tell.
that will solve all our problems.
sir...
what is that?
it is an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
enhance it.
i needed a break.
where are we?
we are about an hour away.
i can not believe i slept.
you were tired.  here...  for twenty-thousand i like to throw in breakfast.  so what do you dream about?
i dream I am asleep.  i dream that I am asleep and i can not wake up.  i do not think i smoke.
you ever think maybe you have a family?
i thought about it.  i do not know.
she is a gypsy.  if it is a cover, it is a great one.
I am assuming we are exploring that possibility.
we are exploring every possibility.  we are in pursuit.  how much more do you want me to tell you?
pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
no.  pursuit ends when we know exactly where he is.
yes, well, i think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  I am bringing in some people from upstairs.
we have been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. we have been sleeping down here.  we just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we finally have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  I would rethink that.
i want a second opinion.
this is an operations desk.
I am not asking.
slow down.  no, do not stop.  just...
that is it?  is that it?
four-fifty.  that is the address...
looks familiar?
no.  no.  go around.  keep going...
where?
yeah.  pull in here.  park it.
so this is it, right?
i guess.
i should go.
i do not remember any of this.
jason...
okay, so...
thanks for the ride.
anytime.
look, i do not know what is up there.
you got me pretty fucking curious.
look, you could come up.  or you could wait if you want.  i could go check it out.  you could wait.
nah...  with you, i mean, you would probably just forget about me, right?
how could i forget about you?  you are the only person i know.
this is like a real apartment.  this is really yours?
i guess so.
this is your office?  god, you live like a monk...
all this stuff -- it is all about boats.  i think I am in the shipping business.
see.  it is starting to come back, yeah?  you mind if i take a bath?
go ahead.
...yes -- oui -- uh...

paris?
yes, sir...  how can i help you?
yes, i'm...i'm looking for mr. jason bourne.
one moment, please...  I am afraid, i have no one by that name registered, sir.
d'accord...  merci.  un moment -- un moment --
-- sir? --
-- hang on -- i need you to check another name for me -- hang on -- un moment, s'il vous plait --
kane.  do you have mr. john michael kane?
one moment, sir.
bonjour?  monsieur?  allo...
yes, I am here...
you call about monsieur kane?  john michael kane?
yes.  is he there?
you are a friend of his?
yes.
i have some very bad news for you, sir.  I am terrible sorry to have to tell you this, but monsieur kane has passed away almost two weeks ago...
there was an accident.  on the motorway.  apparently, he was killed instantly.  really, I am terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
...i understand...
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. when they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
who?  who came?
his brother.  you know his brother?
right.  yes.  of course.
it is very bad this.  terrible sad. such a young man.
do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
i think not...  no, I am sorry.  it was very sudden. he was here very briefly.
-- no -- marie -- no! -- it is not like that --
-- please -- jason -- omigod --
-- quiet -- quiet --
-- what are you doing? -- jason, please, tell me what is happening!
open it --  -- do it -- what is he got in there?
why are you trying to kill me?
...omigod, no...
what? -- what? --  -- what is it?
...this is my picture... he is got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
-- just --
-- where does this come from? --  how do you have my picture?
marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
-- he is got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
-- let me do this, okay? --
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he is got my picture --  -- he is -- my god -- look at him -- he is bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
he is dead is not he?
marie -- look at me -- there is no time for this --
he went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
-- we can not stay here -- i can not stay here -- it is not safe here --
he came to kill us.
-- we can go -- i can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
you knew he was coming.
no.
i trusted you.
you are wrong.  i did not know.
i do not trust anybody and i trusted you!
i did not know this would happen.
he had my picture!  he knew i was here!  he came here to kill us!
and where is he now?  you believe what you want, but I am telling you the truth -- i never would have brought you here if i thought it was dangerous.
oh, jesus...
you stay -- if you want, you stay -- it is okay -- it is better -- maybe it is better -- i do not know --  but i can not stay here.  i can't.
but the police --
-- there is no time --
-- we will explain it --
-- how? --
-- there is two of us -- we will tell them -- we will just --
-- forget it --
-- we will tell them what happened --
i do not know what happened!  i do not know who he is!  i do not know what he wants!  i do not even know who i am!  the only thing i know is that if i stay here, I am never going to find out!
that was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  he is loose.  he is out of control.  it is very clear what needs to happen.  i have work to do.
what if he is working for someone else?  what if he turned?
turn?  to who?  where does he turn? what does he have to offer?  he is got nothing.  he is a killer.  he is a piece of equipment for crissake. where is he going to turn?
you stayed there five times in the past six months.  but i did not have time -- i could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  some room service -- there is half a dozen phone calls here so that is someth--
who paid the bill?
it is a company... mpg capital.
-- let's check that interpol window again --
-- I am on it --
-- i want that red car -- the girl -- we gotta get lucky here --
no.  we can not risk it.
our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  this is it.  he is trained -- conditioned -- they are built to disappear.  you give him another day to run and we may never find him.
this does not go upstairs.
mr. kane...  come right in...please...have a seat.
thanks.
well...  i must admit, when my assistant told me you were here i was, really -- i was quite -- i was surprised.
really.
we thought you were gone for good.
did you?
well, i mean it is a tough business, is not it?  cutthroat.
look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we did not hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we would really like a chance to do a bit better.  I am assuming you are still in the market.  it is the same vessel?
yes.
we just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  i think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as i said, a bit more competitive.
okay.
was it the break-in?
excuse me?
we also thought we had not heard from you -- we have had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
i had not heard.
let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
that would be great.
i found it.  it took six calls.  i found kane.  i found the body.
let's go --  we got to get away from this phone.
where did this body go?
i said, someone came last night --  look, this is not a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it is not just to come in whenever you like --
shit, we did not sign in.
so get the hell out of here.
fine.  but I would like to sign in.  in fact, i insist on it.  where is the book?  i got to sign in --
is this it? --  -- this is it, right? --
-- slow down -- you can not just take the book like that --
-- do not sweat it, i have a pen -- no problem -- just let me find the page --  -- honey, why do not you wait for me outside, okay? --
-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- I am the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
-- what do i? -- i put the name of the person i came to see? --
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
-- here we go -- i found it --
-- i do not know what you are doing and you are scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
nykwana wombosi.
what is that?
it is a name.  mr. wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  he is the proud owner of an alliance security package.  he also paid a visit to the morgue to see john michael kane.
what does that mean?  jason, what does that mean?  jason, please...who is he?
i do not know.
so what are we doing?
go back to the hotel.
-- he went inside! --
-- if we can get a clean shot --
-- inside the house? --
-- that is what they are trained for -- just a surgical strike.
forget it.
what do you want to do?
we do not know what we are into!
we are in the shitter, man!  pick your poison.  maybe he is in there to finish the job.  maybe he is working for wombosi.  maybe they want to go on tv together.  every possibility sucks -- we have got to move!
did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  it was tax shelters, was not it?  swiss debenture-swaps.
mpg capital.
i think investment advice from a dead man, it is a bad idea.  how does it feel to be dead?
it is a lot more stressful than i thought.
who do you think sent me?
i know who sent you.  i do not know why.  i learned many, many things from the cia.  many things.  i learned the way they think.  was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
was this a game or a fuck up?
i do not know.
get the kids out!
I am going to paris.
no you are not.  you are not going anywhere.  I am shutting this down.
you are not doing shit.  you are so scared you can not even think.
you just blew up a house in paris! this program is over.  call it off.
i can not call it off.  he is not responding.  get out of my way.
it does not matter who you were before.  it is who you want to be. that is all that matters.  we have this money.  we have what we have.  i had nothing before and now, i do not know, maybe i have more, maybe it is nothing, but...  i say we leave here.  we leave this place.  we go until we can not go anymore.
you could do that?
yes.  that is who i want to be.
xxxxxx...
xxxxxx
xxxxxx.
xxxxxx
stop where you are.
what?
where is the dog?
my husband's out looking for him.
he run away often?
that old beast?  miss his breakfast? not a chance.  it is always something, right?
get in the basement.
what?
get everyone down in the basement.
what the hell're you talking about?
you are in danger.  all of you.  i have no time to explain.
wait a minute --
I am sorry.
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
i will not let that happen.
xxxxxx

we have to keep moving.

treadstone?
...which one are you?...
paris.  i live in paris...
...headaches...you have that...i get such bad headaches...
yes.
...it's a problem...
treadstone.
...or in a car...when it is dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  treadstone had those pills...
what is treadstone?
...what did you do?...you must have really fucked up...
i think so.
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
what do they want me to do?
...they will not let you go...
why?
and that is it?
if you are lucky.  take it.  there is enough in there to make a life.  any life.  just get out now. get low.  stay low.  take it.
what was i thinking, right?
i can not protect you anymore.
what about you?
I am going to find the end of this.  i can not protect you.
are you treadstone?
am i treadstone?  me?  what the hell're you talking about?
what did you do to me?
what did i do?  i spent thirty million dollars on you.  i spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  what did i do?  what in the name of god have you been doing, jason?
i do not know.
they are right about you, are not they?  you are fried.  you really do not know what is going on, do you?
i know you have been trying to kill me.
of course.  we had to try.  we did not know what was wrong.  we did not know you were in trouble.
so now you know.
so it is time to go home.
that is all i get?
we will make you better.  we can put the pieces back.  we can do that.
i do not think so.
we have to go home, jason.
jason bourne is dead.
there never was a jason bourne.  you have to come with me.  it is the only way.  we can give it back to you...
keep it.
jason...  they can not let you go...
that will be their second worst mistake.
can i help you?
this your store?
yes.
think i could rent a scooter?
you have id?
not really.
