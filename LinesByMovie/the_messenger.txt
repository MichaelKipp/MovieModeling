you know I am always happy to see you, jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...
i need to confess.
but you already confessed this morning...
i need to confess again.
so... alright.  what terrible sin have you committed since then that can not wait till tomorrow to be forgiven?
i saw a poor monk without shoes so i gave him some.
there is no sin in charity, jeanne.
they were not my shoes.  mine were too small.
whose were they?
my father's.
I am sure he will forgive you.
he already did, but i want god to forgive me too.
jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we would spend our whole life in church.
is that bad?
well no, but... jeanne, are you happy at home?
oh yes... very.
and your mother -- everything's fine with her?
oh yes, she's... wonderful.
good, good.  and your sister... catherine -- she is still your best friend?
oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
and what about your other friends... you do not like playing with them?
oh yes, i play with them... lots...
so... everything sounds... wonderful?
yes, it is.
then... why are you here so often?
i feel safe here.  and it is where i can talk to him.
him?
well, i try and talk to him, but mostly he is the one who does the talking.
who is this "he"?
he never says his name.
what... does he... look like?
beautiful.
and what does he say to you?
he says... he says i must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  do you think he is coming from the sky?
perhaps... but wherever he comes from, i think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he is giving you very good advice.
are you alright?  did they hurt you?
no no, I am fine, really...
i was so worried -- we have all been looking for you!  the english are everywhere!  o thank you, lord!
really?
i was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
quick -- hide in here...
what about you?
do not worry about me -- just stay in here... and do not move!
but where are you going to be?
I will be right here... i promise.
i heard about your sister, and i... understand your pain...
why did she have to die?
only god knows the answer to that.
i know jesus says to love our enemies but i can not -- i just want the english to burn in hell for ever and ever!
i realize your anger, jeanne, but we must learn to forgive.  it is hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
then what will?  and what will bring her back?  and why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  why did not he take my life instead of hers?  it was my fault -- i was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
jeanne... calm down...!  calm down, jeanne!
i do not want to wait for his call.
jeanne, be patient.
i want to be with him always...
soon you will be able to take the holy mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
i want to be at one with him now.
she pretends she is been sent by god! these charlatans -- it is a pity there is not enough wood to burn them all!
she says she will be here tomorrow...!
you must not see her, my lord.  we know nothing about her... we do not even know if she is from lorraine.
what difference does it make where she comes from?
if she comes from burgundy it makes a difference.  it might be a trap...  look... signed "x".  what sort of name is "x"?  or must we conclude that a messenger of god can not even write her own name?
not exactly.  she wants you to give her an army -- at your expanse.  bearing in mind that your mother stole every last piece of gold in the treasury, i fail to see how you can afford such an adventure.
i can see her if i want to.  i mean, with half of france in the hands of the english, what have i got to lose?
the other half.
your health and happiness has always been my first concern, charles... ever since you were a little boy -- and i think i know you better than your own mother...
you think?
mmmm.  yes.  i know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  i know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
w-w-what has that got to do with this maiden?
who better than a messenger from god to give answers to your questions?
you really think she is been sent... by god?
you are a fine judge of character, charles.  it will take you less than five minutes to expose her if she is a fake.  but if she is not -- then she will give you your answers... and place the crown on your head.
your majesty, i urge you not to see this woman.  it all reeks of a burgundian trap!
my astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- leo, with virgo rising.  have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the virgin is next to the lion?
supposing she is an assassin?
tremoille, I am not even king yet... who would want to assassinate me?
oh dear, why is life so complicated? sometimes i really wish i could be someone else.
that is a good idea, sire.
what do you mean?
let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
... if she can find me? -- that is a brilliant idea!  if she is really been sent by god she will discover the trap, and if she is an assassin she will kill the wrong man!  bring her up!
why not you -- jean d'aulon?  the only man who is poorer than i am, and so the only man i can trust. dignified, honorable, wise... what more could we ask of a king?
my lord, I am not sure that...
my dear aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
majesty, i can't...
why, are you not ready to die for your king?
of course i am, it is just that...
good.  until then, feel free to live like a king!
sire, you know how bad i am at this sort of game.
so... pretend it is not a game.
there is no need to be afraid, sire.
i'm... I am not the king...
i know you are not yet -- but you will be, soon.
your majesty, i really think you...
my dear loyal tremoille, i know i can count on you...
... as always, majesty...
... to ensure our privacy.  i need to talk to her.  alone.
what was my mission?  to help my country?  but how could i do that? i was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so i decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
you did well...
i did not wait long.  one day i was going to mass, like i do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again...
... and what... what did he say?
he said that i have to save france from her enemies and give her back to god, and he told me that i -- jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at rheims to be crowned king of france.
jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, jean d'aulon.  jean... i place her in your care.  find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
yes, my lord.
i do not need lodgings if we are to be marching on orleans...
orleans has held out for six months. i do not suppose a few days will make much difference.  take some rest.
brilliant idea... but to be really effective, why not send a whole army of virgins?
that will put fire in my soldiers!
listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it was not really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
do you think i could have some water?
i would like some fresh straw.
louis... water and fresh straw!
and i would like to see a priest.
now?
yes.  i did not confess today.
right.  raymond... a priest.
i shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
now?
better today than tomorrow.
well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what i can do.
i also need someone who can read and write.
this i can do.  i was studying at the university of paris -- till the english invaded it.
i thought you were an archer?
yes, i am.  I am an archer who can read and write.  who do you want to write to?
the king of england.  i want to give them the chance to leave orleans in peace before i get there.
my captains have sworn their support.
no doubt your captains will fight for your fine cause -- but what about the ordinary soldier?  they do not fight for causes these days. they fight for money.  who is going to pay them?
you will??
for the sake of france, charles. and for the sake of my grandson.
my lord dunois... i have wonderful news! -- finally -- he is sending her to us -- thanks be to god -- we are saved -- it is wonderful!
calm yourself, xaintrailles.  now slowly.  who has finally done what?
the dauphin -- he is sending us food -- and supplies -- and an army -- led by jeanne -- the maiden from lorraine -- is not it wonderful?!
yes, it is a miracle.
and it is not the first one!  they say she saved a little boy who was dying of...
xaintrailles...!  do not talk to me about miracles...  if i was still sitting there waiting for a miracle, I would be dead now. anyway...
but... do not you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
as long as she brings food and supplies, she will be welcome.
were you sent by lord dunois?
yes... they were.
good.  where are the english?
everywhere.  where is the food?
it is coming -- i rode on ahead.  i have to speak with the captain of the english army... his name's talbot...
i know...
good.  can you bring me to him?
he is on the other side of the river.
so who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
hey, my friend!  I am glad to see your ugly damn face again!
la hire, I am warning you -- do not swear!
sorry jeanne...  did you both meet already?
jeanne, let me introduce the king's half brother, the dogged lord dunois.
then, lord dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
wait, wait...
for what?
because... because -- i mean -- the english have a broad sense of humor, but... i mean, you do not understand... to them you are a witch, working for the devil.  what makes you think they will listen to you?
because if they don't, I will raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
well.  I would love to see that, but after taking counsel with my captains, i felt it would be better to first bring the food into the city, then wait till alencon arrives with reinforcements before doing anything.
you may have been with your counsel, but I have been with mine, and I am telling you, god's counsel is wiser than yours, and he is telling me to speak to the english -- now!
fine -- go now if you want, but not with me!  you may have a duty to god but i have a duty to my people, and my people are starving!  so right now I am going to take the food back to the city, and if you can please calm down, and let me accompany you to orleans, it will be my honor to welcome you.
jesus christ... the goddamn english will pay for this!
they will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
who do they think i am?!
jeanne, calm down.  you can not blame the people -- they have been hearing all about you for weeks.
there is nothing to hear -- i have not done anything.  and why have not i done anything?  because none of you will listen to me!!
and... what does jeanne think?
i do not think.  i leave that to god. I am nothing in all this, I am just the messenger.
so... what is the message?
we offer the english a last chance to return home in peace.  if they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the tourelles.
jeanne, that really makes no sense at all.  the tourelles is virtually impregnable... besides, if we are on the other side of the river attacking the tourelles, what is to stop talbot attacking the city from the north?
god.
god... why of course -- we would forgotten about him!  strange, i do not seem to remember seeing him at agincourt.
damn right!
oh, but i forgot!  it was a sunday... that explains it.  god's day off.
you know, i feel a great sorrow for you, because you are laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of god.
jeanne, with respect -- we can not just attack the tourelles like that -- it is a very complicated matter and...
what complicated about it?  all you have to do is do what you are told -- what could be simpler than that? I am the drum on which god is beating out his message -- beating so loudly it is bursting my ears -- but you are all so full of your own voices, you are deaf to his!
"be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I have shown more patience than a dozen saints!
jeanne, you have to understand -- it is not easy for us -- i mean for our pride -- to suddenly be usurped by a -- well, with all due respect, by a... girl.
ah, so that is it.  to you I am just a girl.
jeanne, put yourself in my shoes for a moment -- how would you feel, if you were me?
knowing what i know?  enormous gratitude.
i do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
me too...
jeanne, stop it!
how dare you stop me doing god's will!
he did not tell you to cut all your hair off...!
how dare you tell me what god tells me to do!
alright, whatever -- but since he is not going to come down and cut it himself, at least let someone cut it properly!
what did they say?
uh... they said... they will think about it.
good.
but... to be honest... i do not think they will leave tomorrow.
what is going on?!
they have started the battle without me!
what happened?  who gave the order to attack?
god knows, but it was a bad idea!
were the men confessed?  where are the priests?
dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  answer me?!
can we -- uh -- discuss this later?
sooner is better than later!
we return to orleans... across the bridge, at the tourelles.
but the bridge has been pulled down!
the english are rebuilding it.
position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up dijon culverins either side of those trees...
the wind will be against us...
the wind will be with us!  do as i say.
there must be something we can do for her for chrissakes!
yes.  we can pray.
good idea...
i swear I will never swear again in my life if you save her life!  but I am warning you, if you let her die, then you are the biggest...
do not swear...
not so... easily.  why are not you... fighting...?  go on... we are almost there...
jeanne, you have been badly wounded...
no, it's... it is nothing, it's...
physicians are a waste of time. you will have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at agincourt!
I would sooner die than use magic!
alright... i promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.
i promise...
jeanne's alive!
good.
we have to press home the attack!
sound the retreat...
but i promised jeanne we would fight on!
i made no such promise.  sound the retreat for the night!
but that was her order!
I am fed up with taking her orders. she swore she would defeat the english before nightfall, instead of which she goes and plays the fool and gets herself nearly killed!  look at the mess we are in!  that is her mess, not mine...!  we are worse off then if she would never come at all!  ... now do as i say and sound the retreat!
what is going on?
we are taking back the tourelles!
jeanne, what are you doing with that... you have got it back to front...
i know what I am doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
prepare these as battering-rams!
what is the use?  the drawbridge is up!
not for long...
the king said you are his finest archer...?
well...
come with me...
clear?
perfectly.
stand by with the battering-rams...
we need another ten minutes...
the bridge will not wait!
jeanne... what are you doing?
playing...
what have you done to me?
i -- i -- i...
jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? are you alright?
yes...
it is over, jeanne.  we won, just as you said!
we... won?!
won?!  such a small word will never do!  this is victory, jeanne, this is... glory!
you call this... glory...?  all this... this blood... this smell of...
... the smell of victory, jeanne! mmmmmmm!  i love it!
it is not possible...
you look disappointed... is not this what you wanted?
no... not like this...
for weeks you have been asking for this... well now you have it!
stop it!  what are you doing?
nothing... just taking his teeth.
but you can not just kill a man for his teeth!
why not?  he has good teeth...
because... because you just can't!
besides, what about these...?
that is different... i mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
jeanne... get up... this is ridiculous...
if you kill him, you kill me!
jeanne... let him do it.  one more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
i care!  and i care because god cares!  all life is precious to god -- even his -- even yours and mine...
jeanne... the man has not been paid for six months -- that is his only reward.  let him take a few teeth...
a few teeth... that is the price of his life?
yeah...
here -- take this instead.
bravo!  what about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  do we let them go too?
maybe... i do not know... but first we have to confess...
jeanne, if you do not mind... I will stay standing... this armor... it is a nightmare to get back up...
i said, kneel!
well...?  shall we go?
not yet.
the english will not wait.
I will go.
jeanne, no...
he is probably right -- let's call a delay...
there is no time, sire -- we can not hold up the ceremony... there is no telling when the english might come back... they are only ten leagues away...
let them come!  let them see who is the true king of france!
it is the sacred place that matters, charles -- not the size.  am i correct, bishop?
oh yes, my lady.  all true kings of france must first be anointed in our great cathedral of rheims... with the holy oil of clovis... for it was within these very walls that saint remy received the sacred oil from heaven, brought to him by a white dove for the anointing of king clovis...
i do not understand... the holy oil of clovis... it was quite full the last time i saw it...
and when was that?
well... at the coronation of king charles vi...
thirty years ago?  I am not surprised it is gone...
no no, you do not understand -- this is no ordinary oil -- this is miraculous... this oil was brought from heaven by a white dove to crown king clovis in this... very... cathedral...
w-w-what are you doing?!
performing a miracle.
ah, jeanne... come here...!  this whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
... you look wonderful...
... and my crown does not fit and...  really??
jeanne...!  are you alright?
yes.  yes, I am fine...  we need more brushwood!  why are you staring at me like that?
because there is an arrow in your leg.
this is no good!
no good?  this is a disaster!
jeanne... the men are exhausted!
i know, but so is the enemy -- they are falling back -- paris is ours...!
jeanne... we are not enough...
so... bring up the reinforcements!
reinforcements?  where??
right behind us -- dunois with another then thousand men!
jeanne, look behind you.
never look behind -- only ahead!
do you know how to count?
of course i do?  bring them up!
jeanne... that is not ten thousand reinforcements -- that is one hundred very loyal but very tired soldiers.
but... where is dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
he never sent them... do not you understand?  he does not want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that is all he ever wanted...
but my voices... they promised me...
to hell with your voices -- it is time to face facts!  we have nothing to do here... none of us... not even you.  you should go home, jeanne.
you do not believe me anymore?
we still believe in you, jeanne.  if it were up to me, I would chase every goddamn englishman into the ocean. but it is not up to us anymore -- it is up to the king...
get them out of here!
now hold on -- you are not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
why did you betray me?  paris was ours for the taking!  all i needed was another few hundred men... why did you take back the army you gave me?
gave you?  well now, i would not quite put it like that...
so how would you put it?
well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done.  now it is time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the english.  you see, my dear jeanne... as it is written in the bible, "to everything there is a season:  a time for war, and a time for peace"...
peace will only be got from the english at the end of a lance!
why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  do you enjoy it?  all that blood and noise and pain? diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
so... what am i supposed to do now?
they have abandoned me... like everyone.
what... what do you mean?
it is been weeks since they spoke to me.  since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
maybe their silence is a sign...? maybe it is a sign to go home?
it is not time yet.  my mission is not over yet.  there is still more i must do before i can really -- finally -- go home.
but how do you know that these -- these voices are not really just -- well, you.
well of course they are me!  that is how god talks to me.  if you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. everyone can hear him.
but i hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
all you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
but how do you know what you hear is the truth?
i do not know it.  i feel it.
you make it sound so simple...
the truth is always simple... it is you, jean, who is making things complicated.
me?!  it is not me, it is god who makes everything complicated!  if he is all-powerful, why not let the english stay on their island in the first place?  and why let this war go on for a hundred years?  and why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family?  why, why?!
so... even you do not believe in me anymore...
jeanne... i believe in you... more than anyone...
if you really want to help me, there is one thing you can do.
tell me...
tell the king to give me more men.
it is true.  there is only one king... people need to be reminded of that. nevertheless... jeanne has done so much for us...
i assure you, charles, the maiden has no greater admirer than myself. but whatever our personal feelings, we cannot allow her to conduct her own private war.  for the sake of the kingdom, it is imperative that you stop her going to compiegne...
i... i can not stop her.
i... i do not know... it will sound like we... betrayed her...?
noooo!
do not worry, charles.  if god is still with her, she will be victorious.  we are not her judges... we are just spectators.  let her go to compiegne, as you let her go to orleans, and let god decide her fate.
but... her army's so small now...
then her faith will have to be bigger.
that is not what i asked... why do you want to marry me?
you listen to your voices, i listen to my heart.
what did the king say?
he said that... he is making a treaty with the duke of burgundy and...
it is a trap!  they are buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from england!
did your voices tell you that?  you told me you had not heard them for months...
no, but...
or maybe it is jeanne who is in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can not stop?
did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
to marry you.
i will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  meanwhile... I am going to compiegne.
jeanne... i have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to compiegne!
jeanne... i believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? do not go... even if you do not want to marry me.
i would like to marry you.  but i have already promised myself... to god.
but... you have done so much for god as it is... can not you do something for yourself for once -- for jeanne?
but it is what i want.
to be killed in battle?
if god wants me to win, he will find a way.  and if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that is fine too.  then I will be with him forever.
will you at least let me stay with you?
it would not be the same without you.
we must sound the retreat!
not yet!
get back inside the town and see if the english are attacking from the other side!
but... why... what is the point?
do as i say!
i want to stay with you...
that is an order!
who... who are you...?
i am that i am.  you do not like my face?  maybe you prefer this one...
who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil?  are you god?
no... no... I am just a messenger... he needs me... a higher calling...
i do not know... i thought...
you think god is not big enough to deliver his own messages?
i do not know... please... tell me I am dead...
who are you to decide if you should live or die?
i... do not know... what do you want from me?
nothing.  I am here to set you free...
so... here is the famous jeanne... savior of orleans... terror of the english?  you look pretty ordinary to me...
am i... am i dead?
dead you are worthless, darling.
where... where am i?
guess.
my king will pay any ransom you ask.
your king?  ah yes, of course... what is he going to pay me with? cows?  chickens?  i prefer gold, and the english have plenty.  i wonder how much they will pay... to have the witch of orleans in their clutches? those english are so arrogant, they can not accept the idea of being defeated by a peasant girl... it has to have been the devil's work.
god defeated the english, not me.
and god who allowed you to be caught?
here... to help pay jeanne's ransom. all the captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of orleans and the other towns she saved...
very generous of you all.  how much?
10,000 gold crowns.
good day, sir.  i trust my honorable duke of burgundy is feeling well?
he is feeling wonderful.
thanks be to god.
and your duke?  the duke of bedford?
not so well, i regret to say.  this business with the maiden... it is caused him endless grief and torment.  that is why he is entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
buying her?
this word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation.  in fact what we -- the church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by god, as she claims.  you understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse god's name in this manner...
i understand.  how much?
5,000 gold crowns.
that is not a lot.
it is all his majesty can afford. he has even donated his very own personal savings.  his majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
i know... but the english want her very badly, and i have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
may i, without offending you, inquire how generous?
20,000 gold crowns.
20,000?!  but... i heard king charles was... financially embarrassed.
do not look at the cost, look at what it brings.  what is your last offer?
8,000.  we can not raise more... we can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
i must offer to the duke.  i will give you his answer tomorrow.
oh, thank you lord!  I am so glad to see you!  i need to confess... i have not been confessed since easter... or been to mass... will you hear me now?
i will hear you... but not now, not here.
who are you?
pierre cauchon, bishop of beauvais. as you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
trial?  what trial??
your trial, jeanne.  on a charge of heresy.
but... the king -- my king -- did not he pay my ransom?
it seems that the english care more about you than the french.
the english??
yes.  they paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at rouen.
what are you doing out here?
i might ask you the same question.
i... I am leaving... i can not take anymore...
and what exactly is it that you can not take anymore of?
everything!  prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- i can not stand it anymore -- I would rather die!
you will be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry?  why not face up to your lies?  it is your lies you can not stand anymore...
i... i never lied!
if you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you would not need to run away from yourself like this...
i am true -- to my lord, the king of heaven.  he knows how much i love him -- that is all that matters to me...
how can you pretend that you love god when you are about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? life is a gift, you should know that by now jeanne -- a gift from god. you know what he would say to you, if he was here?  "what are you doing to me, jeanne?"
that is too easy.  one minute you want to die, the next you want to live...  do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you do not want it anymore?
no, no... I am just so tired, and lost, and... i did not realize what i was doing!
oh?  and just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
i do not know -- i do not care anymore -- i just want to be at peace!
oh, so you do not want war anymore? you want to be at peace?  you want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
i do not understand.  what do you want from me?
i told you already... I am here to set you free...
my dear aulon...  that is fine...
jeanne's been badly injured!  she jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
it is a miracle she is not dead!
we have to do something before she tries it again!  i beg of you, my lord, do not let her down... let me organize an escape...
jean, it's... it is not so easy...
but not impossible... gilles and la hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
jean... me dear, loyal jean... why do you want to oppose the will of god?  jeanne wanted to go to compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  then, on my personal orders, regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  and now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  jean, open your eyes -- can not you see the hand of god in all this?
no.  i see the hand of tremoille, and regnault, and yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
what do you fear most now... my sword?  ... or his hands?
tremoille... don't.  please...
take the holy gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.
i do not know what you are going to ask me questions about.  you may ask things that i will not want to answer.
you will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
i will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I have never told anyone except my king... charles the seventh... the one and only king of france.
you must take the oath!  not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.
i will willingly swear to tell you what i am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, i still will not tell you.
so... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you are allowed to tell us that much?
my name is jeanne.  my little cross i had round my neck was taken away from me.  i would like to have it back.
show us a little more cooperation first.  where were you born?
in a village called domremy.
how old are you?
nineteen... or thereabouts...
were you baptized?
yes.  in the church at domremy.
recite the lord's prayer.
not unless you hear my confession.
jeanne, listen to me very carefully. we are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  we do so in the name of our holy mother church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  but we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and i think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  so now... will you please recite our lord's prayer?
not unless you hear my confession.
jeanne -- be careful -- you are not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...
and you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
arrest them!
what are you doing?  this is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
rouen is in english territory.  i have the right to do anything i like.  take them away.
why were you yelling like that?!
what are you doing here?  please... leave... you can not stay here...
why?  are you waiting for someone else?
yes!
who?
my... visions...
they are going to come and visit you in here?
yes... that is what i pray for...!
i want to see that.  do you mind if i stay... on the side?  i will not bother you.
no, no -- you can not stay or they will not come!
why not?
because... i have to be alone!
they will not come anyway.
what do you mean, they will not come?
why would they?
because!  because I have always been faithful to god, and I have followed everything he said... and I have done everything he asked me...
god asked you to do something?
yes... lots of things!
you mean god said, "i need you, jeanne?"
no, but... he sent me so many signs!
what signs?
like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
no.  that was a sword in a field.
but... it did not just get there by itself.
true -- every event has an infinite number of causes -- but why pick one rather than another?  there are many ways a sword might find itself in a field...
i will not tell you more about that. I am more afraid of displeasing him than not answering you...
you are afraid of displeasing god when telling the truth?!
no...
did god forbid you to tell the truth?
no.  but my revelations were for the king of france, not for you.
when you saw your king for the first time, was there an angel over his head?
if there was, i did not see it...
then why did your king believe in you without any proof?
go and ask him yourself.
jeanne, you are not helping yourself.  if you do not answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.
these questions have nothing to do with your trial.
i assure you they do.  so... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
not long ago...
when exactly?  a day, a week -- when?
last night.
what were you doing when the voice came?
praying.
the voice was in your cell?
yes.
what did it tell you?
many things...
did it give you advice?  good advice?
go onto the next question.
good advice for the french, not for the english!  do you think god hates the english?
i do not know, but you are all men of the church... why not ask him yourself?
tell us, jeanne... do you often hear this voice?
yes...
is it here?  now?  in this room?
who is running this trial, you or her?  i can not believe it!  this wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?
she is loyal to her king... it is only to be expected that she...
i understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...
to hell with procedure!  we paid a bloody fortune for this slut, and we can do whatever the hell we like with her, whether the church likes it or not -- is that clear?
but if this trial seems fixed, i fear you will have the very opposite result to the one you want...
we want her burned as a witch!
but in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you will be burning a martyr...
well then?  start proving... or else the church will have another martyr!
you told us about the appearance of this... voice.  what exactly did you see?  part of it... or all of it?
his face.
does he have hair?
yes.
is it long and hanging down?
I am more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
but if the devil were to take on the physical appearance of a saint or an angel... or a man... how would you recognize him?  by what he said?
go on to the next question.
that is enough!  you will answer the question... or face the consequences!
who told you to wear men's clothes?
the clothes are not important...
you also cut your hair short like a man, and in the bible it clearly states that it is an abomination for a woman to pretend to be a man!  it proves your desire to deceive...
it was just... more convenient as i was among soldiers...
so you think you did well to cut your hair and dress as a man?
i... submit to our lord.
but will you also submit to the decision of the church?
it seems to me that the church and our lord are one and the same.  why must you complicate what is so simple?
let me clarify things for you, jeanne.  on the one hand there is the church triumphant, that is to say god, his saints, and the souls that are saved.  and then there is the church militant, that is to say our holy father the pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the church, the clergy, and all good catholic christians.  moreover this church, when assembled, is guided by the holy spirit and therefore cannot be in error.  that is why we ask you to submit to the church militant... that is to say, us.
so it is the church militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good christian?
it is for us to determine whether you are a good christian, not you.
i am sent by god, and i submit all my words and deeds to his judgment. or do you think that you are better judges than he is?
when you were taken prisoner at compiegne, did you have a horse?
yes... a half-steed... white.
who gave you that horse?
my king.
how many did he give you?
five steeds and a few hackneys...
as much as for a lord?  what an honor!  did your king give you other wealth apart from horses?
no.
what about all those dresses you were given... silk dresses were not they?
yes, i was given a few, but i never had time to wear them...
still, pretty wealthy for a peasant girl would not you say?
and you look pretty wealthy for a servant of god, would not you say?
is it true that you launched an attack on paris?
i tried to.
it was on a sunday, was not it?
i do not remember.  maybe.
do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
i do not know...
and did not you order the citizens of paris to surrender the city in the name of the king of heaven?
no... i said "surrender in the name of the king of france"...
that is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
i can not read.
ah, yes, i forgot... god sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission!  do you think that god made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of france?
i leave the answer to god.
tell us, jeanne... why did you jump from the tower at beaurevoir?
i had been sold to the english.  I would rather die than fall into their hands.
did your voice tell you to jump?
no...
so when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
no...!
how can you deny it when you just said "i'd rather die than fall into the hands of the english"...?
that is now what i meant...
do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  no one is allowed to destroy the life that god created!
i know, but that is not the way things happened...
you mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
yes, but...
and you did not jump of your free will?
no!
oh?  perhaps someone pushed you then?
do you have a sword?
quite a few.
did not you also carry a banner?
yes...
which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
i was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
and why was that?  did it have some particular value or power?
no, it is just... a sword is a weapon.
and?
and so i... i prefer my banner.
why?
to avoid killing anyone.
are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner you would have killed more people?
no, of course not... i never killed anyone...
then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
no!  i warned the english to go back home -- i begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat i would bring on them... why did not they listen to me?
we have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
yes, probably... maybe...
so sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
yes, but...
did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
no, i... i held it up to...
you held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? like this?
yes, maybe... i do not remember...
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
no, i... i never killed anyone!
I am not lying, i... i can not remember... leave me alone!
oh?  you can not remember?  let me help your memory...
no!  i do not want to know anymore! leave me alone!  i did not kill that man!
oh no?  how about this one?
stop, stop... i can not remember!  the battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... i was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps i fought back but it was only to defend myself...
so your memory's coming back?
yes... yes!  and now you tell me why god let all these battles happen in the first place... if he is so powerful... he said he is "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  why did not he?
is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
no, but... why did not he stop it? or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
in his name??
yes!  we fought and killed in his name... the king of heaven!
really?
"let all who love me follow me"... where does god get mentioned?  come on jeanne, be honest.  you fought for yourself, in your name.
i... i was defending myself as best i could!  everyone has the right to defend themselves, do not they?  or should i have let myself be killed?
no, no, you did fine.  I would even say well done.  besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, do not you think?
no, i do not think so.  i do not think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
i agree...
i do not agree.  why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
why are you doing this to me??  do you get pleasure from hurting me?
ah, pleasure... that is a difficult word to define.  when does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? when did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
i never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
really?
calm down, my lord, i beg you!
how can i calm down when I am made the laughing-stock of the whole court?!  I have had enough!
be patient, my lord... you have seen how it is.  this girl has a way with people... but everyday we are making progress...
so long as this bitch remains alive, our armies refuse to fight!  do not you understand?  they want proof that god is on their side... and the only way they are going to believe that is when they see her being burnt as a witch!
it is not for us to burn her, my lord.  that is your prerogative.
... and your prerogative is to find her guilty...
but we can not do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
well what are you waiting for? you have got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!
you will not be able to drag anything from her that way.  you also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
scared of a girl?
scared to make a mistake.  supposing she is right... supposing she really has been sent by god??
whose side are you on, cauchon?
I am on the side of our mother holy church.  besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
well find some other way!  be creative.  tell them she fucks the devil... hmm, not a bad idea... why can not you say that?  sounds good to me... and who can prove she doesn't?
i -- i cleaned up my room, look... and i said my prayers... all of them... and...
what are you doing on the wall?
I am trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
what for?
because... because i do not know what else to do to please him.
do you think this cross will protect you?
no, i...
"love your enemies"...
good.  but "love your enemies"... body and soul.
my voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
i do not think so.
are you going to leave me too?
yes... of course... when you do not need me anymore.
are you sent by god?
there is nothing for me to do here anymore... i do not belong here i want to be with him now...
do you think you are ready?
yes i am.
are you willing to follow all his commandments?
yes...
... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
jeanne, i beg of you... sign!  in god's name, do not you understand? I am trying to save you!  if you do not sign, the english will burn you to death!  is that what you want??
no... i want to be confessed.
sign this, and i will confess you myself if you want.
and may i go to mass?
as often as you like -- now, please -- for the love of god -- sign!!
you know what you just signed, jeanne?  you just signed away my existence... for you I am a lie, an illusion.  you see?  in the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
no...
please... may i have it back...
you have nothing to regret...
i did not mean it!  i did not know what i was signing!  you tricked me...!
silence her!  take her away...!
i do not understand, jeanne... why did you do it?  why?
and you?  why did you lie?  you promised i could be confessed...
i know, jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
it is not my body i want to save. it is my soul.
i ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
i -- i can not jeanne... i can not hear your confession... I am sorry...
you think you are ready now?
yes, my lord.
let's see.
i am ready now...
just give me a moment and then you will be free...
I am already free...
yes yes... any moment... you are always so impatient...
my gentle captain... I am staying.
i -- i do not understand...
one day you will.
you do not know what you are saying. you are going to leave this place, jeanne -- you are going home -- or whatever you want -- you are going to be happy, and have children, and...
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even...  ... would not that be a fine thing? you, a lady of title!
I am staying, jean.
no, you must come, jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... i have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and la hire hardly swears at all anymore...  you can not stay -- they will burn you!
I am not afraid of the fire anymore. it will purify me...
jeanne, you can not leave us like this!
