it took this test package thirty-two hours to get from seattle to st. petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  and then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in st. petersburg to here, a distance of, what --
six kilometers.  four miles.
so how are we going to get this place shaped up?
it is bad.
worse than warsaw.
nobody remembers that.
the failures they remember.  it is the successes they forget.
what do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
borrowed.  i borrowed it.
how did it go?
great.  terrific.  the good guys won one for a change.
you what?
it was fifteen minutes late.
i checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
but i might not have.
jesus.  i got it working... you have no idea how hard it was... they are finally a team...
I am touched.
you fucked us over.
the point of fedex, as i understand it, is to make the damn connection.
i was making a point.
what?  let paris hold its plane?  let memphis take care of it?  let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
every person counts, every package counts, that is my point.
you know what your problem is?  you just see the packages in front of you.  you do not see the big picture.
baloney.  i do see the damn "big picture."
i did not know we had sailboats.
it is a ketch kelly and i had chartered.
for all those vacation days you got coming.
and never take.
look, I am sorry about your plane.  but i could not risk being late into memphis.
forget it.
you know general mclelland, he would not attack unless he had everything just right.  finally abe lincoln came to him and said, general, if you are not going to use my army, could i borrow it for a while?  so he gave it to grant and grant just said, let's go.
I am from arkansas.  tell me a story with robert e. lee in it and maybe I will pay attention.
we are warriors, not desk jockeys.  we have got to be bold.  you always want all your ducks lined up.  but nothing's 100 percent.  it is always 60-40, maybe 51-49. hell, I would take 40-60.  then roll the dice.
that is why you are a gambling man.
that is why I am running foreign and you are not.  that is why you are not married and i am.
for the third time.
take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  that is fedex, that is women, that is life.
you are one sick fucker.
I am trying to help you here.  there is warsaw, there is this --
this was nothing like warsaw.  i held the truck then minutes, it is not that big a deal.
a hundred rubles st. petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
ninety five percent?  just give me the money now.
talk is cheap.  are we on or not?
we are on.
sonofabitch!
hey, be nice to it, it will be nice to you.
your eyes are puffy.  did you take valium again?
you smell like formaldehyde.
my last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
let's take a look.
how was russia?
cold.
do not overwhelm me with details, you know how i hate that.  did you get it fixed?
i thought i did.
got to follow the paper path here.
chuck, forget the xerox.  so russia did not turn out well?
chuck.
what do you want me to say?  that i thought I would done a great job but it all turned to shit?  that i might as well have gone sailing for all the good i did?
yeah, tell me.  tell me all of it.
merry christmas eve.
not if you work for fedex.
four four.  a record.
you do not seem too happy about it.
ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
let me guess, russia came up?
hey, look at you.
i figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
he is a cute thing.
he is your cute thing.
i can not even keep fish alive.
a puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
and for you --
you know, for when you travel.
for when i travel?
i have to go.  I am on call for overflow down at the hub.
a ring.  i wanted a ring.
you did?
look, i love the puppy.  i love you.  but i have to go.
you can not go now.
i have to.
you want to.
this is not working out.
we are a little emotional here.  it is christmas, maybe we are over-reacting.
"we're" not over-reacting.
could you watch jango?
no.
i can not take him to work.
what happened to your pants?
mom, meet jango.
bless us o lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through christ the lord.  amen.
let's eat.
thought you were going to bring her.
so did i.
it seemed like she had such a good time last time.
it is nothing you did, mom, believe me.
look, i help take care of the place.  you got my check, did not you mom?
that new roof, that is your doing.
but chickens?
sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  going to pass beef.  chicken's global.  no religious taboos.  you do not see your hindus and your muslims boycotting poultry.
true enough.  no sacred chickens nowhere, so far as i know.
really?
come on down to the plant.  it is state of the art.  we are doing for chickens what fedex did for the delivery business.
just do not count 'em before they hatch.
mom, this is a farm.  we have got real strawberries growing outside, we have got real cream.
oh no, the prodigal son's home.  we bring out the store bought.
maybe i should take a few days off. roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
do not you even think about it.
the place is falling apart.
I am doing fine.
doing great, mom, do not worry about me.
there is settled folks, and there is nomads.  you are just not a settled folk. you never belonged here.
i need the latest pdrs on st. petersburg.
and how was your christmas?
terrific.  yours?
malaysia's tanking.  we are meeting in ten in operations.
right.  get me everything on indonesia, new guinea, all the way to australia.
trying.
kamal, you are breaking up.  can you hear us?
kamal is not here.
who is this?  where is kamal?
it is ibrim, i, i am a sorter.
what is going on down there?
kamal is not here.  we are very defused.
who is in charge then, where is chinn?
when is the next jumbo?
the regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
anything else?
there is a sweep leaving memphis in an hour, goes through sydney.
that is your dog.
it is our dog.  it belongs to us.
there is not any us.
yes there is.
I am sorry about the presents.  i got a little carried away.
no, it was great.  maybe a little overkill --
i burned the christmas tree.
why did not you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch i was.
i guess i had not thought through how i felt.
what, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, kelly that really made me mad?  do not tell me you are mad.  be mad.  be who you are right now.
look, we will do our trip as soon as i get back.
do not even start.
get back?  from where?
malaysia.  they are holding the sweep.
chuck, you are breaking my heart.
a week, max.  okay?  okay?
go on.  we will be fine.  I will feed jango to the frogs.
save some for tomorrow.
catch another fish tomorrow.
shit!  shit!  shit!
stay calm, identify the problem. problem, rope fraying.  solution, fix rope.
with what?  there is nothing to fix it with.  this rope comes undone, you are going to drown.
get up.
feels so good to lie here.
get up, damn you.
can't.  need water.
you have had today's water.
thirsty.
come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
no water, no work.
okay look, i know you are tired, i know you are thirsty, but give it one more shot, you have just got to do a little more.
do too much, I will die.
do too little you will die.
going to die anyway.
no more water, you said.
take it.
no.
take it, damn it.
no.
wilson, do you believe this?  take the damn water.
if they can not see you, what is the point?
survive today, that is the point.
polaris, where are you?  maybe I am too far south.
you do not know where you are.  you missed the shipping lanes.
moon's too bright.
you are putting off the inevitable.
I am putting it off.
get water!
fix raft first.
water water water --
you are beautiful.  marry me.
you idiot, if he dives, he will capsize the raft.
what are you doing?
can not kill another one.  can't.  can not kill my friends anymore.
you fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
why do they have to die for me?
they would eat you if they could.  they are laughing at you.  listen.
I am lost.  goodbye.
no!
look, just slip off the raft.  the ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  take a little swim.  sleep.
you quitter you quitter you quitter.
the sea is lovely, dark and deep.
but i have promises to keep.  and miles to go before i sleep.  and miles to go before i sleep.  got to fix the sea anchor.  use the sail.
use the sail for a sea anchor and you will not move.
if i do not have a sea anchor I will capsize.
die tomorrow or die today.
that is death knocking, knocking on your door.  crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...
grow up, stop being such a baby.  other people get through a lot worse.
yeah, sure, what?
you know, wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  thank you god.
thank you for fucking up my life.
what are you smiling about?  they will be back.
I am dancing on the roof of the peabody hotel.  with kelly.
permission to come aboard, sir.
permission granted.
may i ask, where are you bound?
san francisco.  and you?
as it happens, I am headed for frisco myself.
would you do us the honor of joining us? we are just sitting down at mess.  pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
no please, join me.  some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on.
they are never going to see you.  you are just another piece of trash in the ocean.
they are on autopilot.
they are always on autopilot.  or else it is night, or you are in the sun, or you are in the trough of a wave.  they will never see you.
damn it!  do not be so negative!
i float.  you sink.  end of story.
I am serious.  I am always going on about me, me, me.  enough about me.  your turn.
it is a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
shut up.
what is so damn funny?
you are.
jesus.
look again, asshole.  it is a mirage.
it is real.
nothing out there but ocean.
let's get a second opinion.  wilson? what do you see?
what did it matter if fedex was five minutes late one day?  the next day we just start over again.
it matters.  we do the best we can, that is all we have.
then we have just got shit.
you can not make it.
shut up.  i do not feel like dying today.
my favorite doctor.  what is the verdict?
under the circumstances your overall health is good.  those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they are healing nicely.
sorry...sorry... why do my joints still ache?
dehydration.  vitamin deficiency. protein deficiency.  any or all of the above.
all i ate was fish.  that is solid protein.
protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
which i did not have.
and fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  so you are going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some vitamin c, so you did not get scurvy.
i am one lucky guy.
your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  it is almost like schizophrenia.  different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
but all that is behind me.  I am fine now.
if you say you are.
i most definitely say i am.
doctor hegel tells me he discussed the vietnam pow syndrome with you.
yes, yes he did.
you are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
not to mention on me.
doc, I am not on the island.  I am not on the raft.  I am alive.  I am so glad to be back, i can not tell you.  i just want out of here.
well, when that iv runs out, you are through with us.  just the dentist tomorrow.
hello?
stan, it is chuck...chuck noland...
god damn!  god damn!  chuck, it is you!
it is me.
you are fucking dead!
I am most definitely not dead.  and as i recall, you are the sick fucker.
i beat the odds!
you beat 'em to shit, pal!  jesus!
hello.
this is amber.  her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.
I am sorry... I am sorry...
hey...hey...it's okay!
right back, you said you would be right back.
a few things came up.  or went down.
i got married.
i thought you might have.
i would never --
i know.
if I would known you were alive --
i would have done the same thing.
i did not want to.  it just happened.  one day gary was there.  he took care of everything.  he took care of me.  i was a mess.
you have any children?
her name's hannah.
is that jango?
no, this is jack.  jango was hit by a ups truck.  can you believe it?
how about we go somewhere else?
want to see my raft?
this stinks really bad.
you should have smelled me.
cool ropes.
i braided them.
must have taken a hell of a long time.
time i had lots of.
what is that?
that is my sea anchor.  my second one. made it out of part of the sail.  it keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  in theory.  and this, this i used to collect water. about half a cup a day.
you were how long on this?
forty-three days.
all that time i waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
what is that, written on the sail?
my epitaph.
there was a coffin?
yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
what was inside?
your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
that about sums it up.
maybe now's when you tell me about it.
the plane went down.  my friends died.  i washed up on an island.  then i found these barrels, built the raft, and here i am.
yeah?
the tide came in, the tide went out.  i survived.  that is the headline.  i survived.
do not overwhelm me with the details.  you know how i hate that.
come on.  try.
cliches, mainly.  do not take anyone for granted.  do not sweat the small stuff. live each day like it is your last.
so simple to say, so hard to do.
not when you have no choice.
you hated being alone.  could not stand it.  busy every minute.  always plugged into something.
i did not know what really being alone was.  no one back here does.
this is so unfair.
that is what i told the fish i caught. but i ate them anyway.
you okay?
great.  really.
what will you do?
i do not know.  i really do not know.
I have got to get back to memphis. hannah's babysitter has finals.
it means a lot...that you came.
i had to come.  to be sure you were okay.
i love you, chuck.
you too.
I am so glad you are alive.
when i first showed up, i thought you would lost your fucking marbles.
i never thought it would end.  then it did.  it was so great to be saved, i could not stop laughing.
to wilson.
to wilson.
you have been over the line and you came back.  you have been saved, hallelujah!
hallelujah.
I am serious.  the burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
what is it all about?  it is about being so thirsty you would crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that is what it is about.
to life.  fuck 'em if they can not take a joke.
to life.
that is all there is.
believe me i know.
digital laser readers.
digital laser readers.  wow.  terrific.
take your time.
what?
that is what it is about.
being patient.  do not rush things.  i get it.
not just that.  take your time.  use it. live it.
deep, real deep.
what, then?
deliver this package.  then, i dunno.
you want that delivered, we will deliver it.  that is what we do.
i need to do it.
finish what you started.  you have not changed, chuck.  it is still you.
okay.  after three years the ptr reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the cpc.  here it is.  ten packages from the same sender.  baku. delhi.  st. petersburg.  the guy was a real road warrior.  this package was kuala lampur.  no activity in his account after this package.  no forwarding addresses after k.l.
what about the sender?
sure.  bettina peterson.  marfa, texas. let's run a current check.
hmmm.  durango, colorado; asheville, north carolina, then...canceled her account.
can you find her?
you are looking at a level iii search. for your level iii, you got to have e-4 authorization.  i do not have it.
thanks.  for everything.
no sweat.
when'd you start working here?
roger got me on.  i was not doing anything, and -- but you are back, you are really back.  i would have come to memphis, but --
i wanted to come here.
I have got all this back pay coming.  why do not you let me get you a place in town?
this is my home.  I am part of the wallpaper.
what a journey you have had.  it seems more than a person should have to bear.
the tide saved me, mom.  i lived by it. I am just wondering where it will take me next.
you came on a bicycle?  no wonder it is so late.
there was an unavoidable delay.
well, i have to say, I am impressed.  you never gave up.
no.
you know what happened to this?
as much as anybody.
want to come in?  get dry for a minute.
okay.  sure.
hmmm.  feels like it might have gotten wet.
possible.  so you did those wings?
yeah.  a long time ago.
they are harder to do than they look.
oh?  you have tried?
well, i do a little drawing --
our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
he was a sorry sonofabitch, and I am sorry i ever married him.
i can not believe this.  i -- i -- they are... you are a gifted artist.  you are into something very powerful.  primal. truly.
well, not really, i --
you are.  yes you are.  what gave you the idea to paint on that cave?
to tell you the truth -- you did.
do you...have any more packages to deliver?
no.  that was the last one.
just sit here, I will get us some lunch.
keep painting.  promise me.
sure.
need some help?
you bet i do.  high tide comes right up to this road.
you are not out of pascagoula, are you?
no.
i used to drive one of those.  a long time ago.
hey, once a driver, always a driver.  you want a lift?  I have just got one more pickup.
sure.
you are chuck noland.
yeah.
did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?
i did not steal it, and he was not crippled.
what brings you out to the sticks?
had a package to deliver.
you?  personally?
i had it on the island with me.
must be a story there.
yeah, a long one.
I have got lots of time.
so do i.
