it took this test package thirty-two hours to get from seattle to st. petersburg, a distance of nine thousand miles.  and then it took forty-one hours to get from our warehouse in st. petersburg to here, a distance of, what --
six kilometers.  four miles.
so how are we going to get this place shaped up?
it's bad.
worse than warsaw.
nobody remembers that.
the failures they remember.  it's the successes they forget.
what do you expect, from the guy who stole a kid's bicycle when his truck broke down?
borrowed.  i borrowed it.
how'd it go?
great.  terrific.  the good guys won one for a change.
you what?
it was fifteen minutes late.
i checked the weather, you had the jet stream, you could have made it up.
but i might not have.
jesus.  i got it working... you have no idea how hard it was... they're finally a team...
i'm touched.
you fucked us over.
the point of fedex, as i understand it, is to make the damn connection.
i was making a point.
what?  let paris hold its plane?  let memphis take care of it?  let somebody down the line clean up your mess?
every person counts, every package counts, that's my point.
you know what your problem is?  you just see the packages in front of you.  you don't see the big picture.
baloney.  i do see the damn "big picture."
i didn't know we had sailboats.
it's a ketch kelly and i had chartered.
for all those vacation days you got coming.
and never take.
look, i'm sorry about your plane.  but i couldn't risk being late into memphis.
forget it.
you know general mclelland, he wouldn't attack unless he had everything just right.  finally abe lincoln came to him and said, general, if you're not going to use my army, could i borrow it for a while?  so he gave it to grant and grant just said, let's go.
i'm from arkansas.  tell me a story with robert e. lee in it and maybe i'll pay attention.
we're warriors, not desk jockeys.  we've got to be bold.  you always want all your ducks lined up.  but nothing's 100 percent.  it's always 60-40, maybe 51-49. hell, i'd take 40-60.  then roll the dice.
that's why you're a gambling man.
that's why i'm running foreign and you're not.  that's why you're not married and i am.
for the third time.
take the plunge, admit your mistakes, move on to tomorrow.  that's fedex, that's women, that's life.
you are one sick fucker.
i'm trying to help you here.  there's warsaw, there's this --
this was nothing like warsaw.  i held the truck then minutes, it's not that big a deal.
a hundred rubles st. petersburg hits 95 percent in a month.
ninety five percent?  just give me the money now.
talk is cheap.  are we on or not?
we're on.
sonofabitch!
hey, be nice to it, it'll be nice to you.
your eyes are puffy.  did you take valium again?
you smell like formaldehyde.
my last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
let's take a look.
how was russia?
cold.
don't overwhelm me with details, you know how i hate that.  did you get it fixed?
i thought i did.
got to follow the paper path here.
chuck, forget the xerox.  so russia didn't turn out well?
chuck.
what do you want me to say?  that i thought i'd done a great job but it all turned to shit?  that i might as well have gone sailing for all the good i did?
yeah, tell me.  tell me all of it.
merry christmas eve.
not if you work for fedex.
four four.  a record.
you don't seem too happy about it.
ah, the staff meeting could have gone better.
let me guess, russia came up?
hey, look at you.
i figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
he is a cute thing.
he's your cute thing.
i can't even keep fish alive.
a puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
and for you --
you know, for when you travel.
for when i travel?
i have to go.  i'm on call for overflow down at the hub.
a ring.  i wanted a ring.
you did?
look, i love the puppy.  i love you.  but i have to go.
you can't go now.
i have to.
you want to.
this isn't working out.
we're a little emotional here.  it's christmas, maybe we're over-reacting.
"we're" not over-reacting.
could you watch jango?
no.
i can't take him to work.
what happened to your pants?
mom, meet jango.
bless us o lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through christ the lord.  amen.
let's eat.
thought you were going to bring her.
so did i.
it seemed like she had such a good time last time.
it's nothing you did, mom, believe me.
look, i help take care of the place.  you got my check, didn't you mom?
that new roof, that's your doing.
but chickens?
sixty three pounds consumed per capita, up from twenty seven in 1960.  going to pass beef.  chicken's global.  no religious taboos.  you don't see your hindus and your muslims boycotting poultry.
true enough.  no sacred chickens nowhere, so far as i know.
really?
come on down to the plant.  it's state of the art.  we're doing for chickens what fedex did for the delivery business.
just don't count 'em before they hatch.
mom, this is a farm.  we've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream.
oh no, the prodigal son's home.  we bring out the store bought.
maybe i should take a few days off. roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
don't you even think about it.
the place is falling apart.
i'm doing fine.
doing great, mom, don't worry about me.
there's settled folks, and there's nomads.  you're just not a settled folk. you never belonged here.
i need the latest pdrs on st. petersburg.
and how was your christmas?
terrific.  yours?
malaysia's tanking.  we're meeting in ten in operations.
right.  get me everything on indonesia, new guinea, all the way to australia.
trying.
kamal, you're breaking up.  can you hear us?
kamal is not here.
who is this?  where is kamal?
it is ibrim, i, i am a sorter.
what's going on down there?
kamal is not here.  we are very defused.
who's in charge then, where is chinn?
when's the next jumbo?
the regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
anything else?
there's a sweep leaving memphis in an hour, goes through sydney.
that's your dog.
it's our dog.  it belongs to us.
there isn't any us.
yes there is.
i'm sorry about the presents.  i got a little carried away.
no, it was great.  maybe a little overkill --
i burned the christmas tree.
why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch i was.
i guess i hadn't thought through how i felt.
what, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, kelly that really made me mad?  don't tell me you're mad.  be mad.  be who you are right now.
look, we'll do our trip as soon as i get back.
don't even start.
get back?  from where?
malaysia.  they're holding the sweep.
chuck, you're breaking my heart.
a week, max.  okay?  okay?
go on.  we'll be fine.  i'll feed jango to the frogs.
save some for tomorrow.
catch another fish tomorrow.
shit!  shit!  shit!
stay calm, identify the problem. problem, rope fraying.  solution, fix rope.
with what?  there's nothing to fix it with.  this rope comes undone, you're going to drown.
get up.
feels so good to lie here.
get up, damn you.
can't.  need water.
you've had today's water.
thirsty.
come on, shape up, get going, you can do it.
no water, no work.
okay look, i know you're tired, i know you're thirsty, but give it one more shot, you've just got to do a little more.
do too much, i'll die.
do too little you'll die.
going to die anyway.
no more water, you said.
take it.
no.
take it, damn it.
no.
wilson, do you believe this?  take the damn water.
if they can't see you, what's the point?
survive today, that's the point.
polaris, where are you?  maybe i'm too far south.
you don't know where you are.  you missed the shipping lanes.
moon's too bright.
you're putting off the inevitable.
i'm putting it off.
get water!
fix raft first.
water water water --
you're beautiful.  marry me.
you idiot, if he dives, he'll capsize the raft.
what are you doing?
can't kill another one.  can't.  can't kill my friends anymore.
you fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
why do they have to die for me?
they'd eat you if they could.  they're laughing at you.  listen.
i'm lost.  goodbye.
no!
look, just slip off the raft.  the ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  take a little swim.  sleep.
you quitter you quitter you quitter.
the sea is lovely, dark and deep.
but i have promises to keep.  and miles to go before i sleep.  and miles to go before i sleep.  got to fix the sea anchor.  use the sail.
use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
if i don't have a sea anchor i'll capsize.
die tomorrow or die today.
that's death knocking, knocking on your door.  crazy little woman come knocking, knocking at my front door...
grow up, stop being such a baby.  other people get through a lot worse.
yeah, sure, what?
you know, wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  thank you god.
thank you for fucking up my life.
what are you smiling about?  they'll be back.
i'm dancing on the roof of the peabody hotel.  with kelly.
permission to come aboard, sir.
permission granted.
may i ask, where are you bound?
san francisco.  and you?
as it happens, i'm headed for frisco myself.
would you do us the honor of joining us? we're just sitting down at mess.  pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
no please, join me.  some sundried fish strips, a few eyeballs, some gills to munch on.
they're never going to see you.  you're just another piece of trash in the ocean.
they're on autopilot.
they're always on autopilot.  or else it's night, or you're in the sun, or you're in the trough of a wave.  they'll never see you.
damn it!  don't be so negative!
i float.  you sink.  end of story.
i'm serious.  i'm always going on about me, me, me.  enough about me.  your turn.
it's a fucking soccer ball, you idiot.
shut up.
what's so damn funny?
you are.
jesus.
look again, asshole.  it's a mirage.
it's real.
nothing out there but ocean.
let's get a second opinion.  wilson? what do you see?
what did it matter if fedex was five minutes late one day?  the next day we just start over again.
it matters.  we do the best we can, that's all we have.
then we've just got shit.
you can't make it.
shut up.  i don't feel like dying today.
my favorite doctor.  what's the verdict?
under the circumstances your overall health is good.  those salt water boils you picked up on the raft are ulcerated, but they're healing nicely.
sorry...sorry... why do my joints still ache?
dehydration.  vitamin deficiency. protein deficiency.  any or all of the above.
all i ate was fish.  that's solid protein.
protein digestion is very costly in water usage.
which i didn't have.
and fish are very low in fat, which is energy inefficient.  so you're going to burn up your own cells no matter how much you eat.  luckily you ate the eyes and pancreas, which contain some vitamin c, so you didn't get scurvy.
i am one lucky guy.
your body chemistry and your exposure to the elements would normally lead to irritability, depression, anxiety, periods of self-reproach.  it's almost like schizophrenia.  different sides of your personality might come to life, speak out, act out.
but all that's behind me.  i'm fine now.
if you say you are.
i most definitely say i am.
doctor hegel tells me he discussed the vietnam pow syndrome with you.
yes, yes he did.
you are aware of the potential disruptiveness on your loved ones when you return to your old life?
not to mention on me.
doc, i'm not on the island.  i'm not on the raft.  i'm alive.  i'm so glad to be back, i can't tell you.  i just want out of here.
well, when that iv runs out, you're through with us.  just the dentist tomorrow.
hello?
stan, it's chuck...chuck noland...
god damn!  god damn!  chuck, it's you!
it's me.
you're fucking dead!
i'm most definitely not dead.  and as i recall, you're the sick fucker.
i beat the odds!
you beat 'em to shit, pal!  jesus!
hello.
this is amber.  her boyfriend lost his foot in a shark attack.
i'm sorry... i'm sorry...
hey...hey...it's okay!
right back, you said you'd be right back.
a few things came up.  or went down.
i got married.
i thought you might have.
i would never --
i know.
if i'd known you were alive --
i would have done the same thing.
i didn't want to.  it just happened.  one day gary was there.  he took care of everything.  he took care of me.  i was a mess.
you have any children?
her name's hannah.
is that jango?
no, this is jack.  jango was hit by a ups truck.  can you believe it?
how about we go somewhere else?
want to see my raft?
this stinks really bad.
you should have smelled me.
cool ropes.
i braided them.
must have taken a hell of a long time.
time i had lots of.
what's that?
that's my sea anchor.  my second one. made it out of part of the sail.  it keeps you from capsizing in a storm.  in theory.  and this, this i used to collect water. about half a cup a day.
you were how long on this?
forty-three days.
all that time i waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
yeah, well...couldn't be helped.
what's that, written on the sail?
my epitaph.
there was a coffin?
yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
what was inside?
your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
that about sums it up.
maybe now's when you tell me about it.
the plane went down.  my friends died.  i washed up on an island.  then i found these barrels, built the raft, and here i am.
yeah?
the tide came in, the tide went out.  i survived.  that's the headline.  i survived.
don't overwhelm me with the details.  you know how i hate that.
come on.  try.
cliches, mainly.  don't take anyone for granted.  don't sweat the small stuff. live each day like it's your last.
so simple to say, so hard to do.
not when you have no choice.
you hated being alone.  couldn't stand it.  busy every minute.  always plugged into something.
i didn't know what really being alone was.  no one back here does.
this is so unfair.
that's what i told the fish i caught. but i ate them anyway.
you okay?
great.  really.
what will you do?
i don't know.  i really don't know.
i've got to get back to memphis. hannah's babysitter has finals.
it means a lot...that you came.
i had to come.  to be sure you were okay.
i love you, chuck.
you too.
i'm so glad you're alive.
when i first showed up, i thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
i never thought it would end.  then it did.  it was so great to be saved, i couldn't stop laughing.
to wilson.
to wilson.
you've been over the line and you came back.  you've been saved, hallelujah!
hallelujah.
i'm serious.  the burning bush, the big picture, the words in neon...
what's it all about?  it's about being so thirsty you'd crush a fish's backbone to suck out the spinal fluid -- that's what it's about.
to life.  fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
to life.
that's all there is.
believe me i know.
digital laser readers.
digital laser readers.  wow.  terrific.
take your time.
what?
that's what it's about.
being patient.  don't rush things.  i get it.
not just that.  take your time.  use it. live it.
deep, real deep.
what, then?
deliver this package.  then, i dunno.
you want that delivered, we'll deliver it.  that's what we do.
i need to do it.
finish what you started.  you haven't changed, chuck.  it's still you.
okay.  after three years the ptr reverts to tape storage, which is okay because we access it through the cpc.  here it is.  ten packages from the same sender.  baku. delhi.  st. petersburg.  the guy was a real road warrior.  this package was kuala lampur.  no activity in his account after this package.  no forwarding addresses after k.l.
what about the sender?
sure.  bettina peterson.  marfa, texas. let's run a current check.
hmmm.  durango, colorado; asheville, north carolina, then...canceled her account.
can you find her?
you're looking at a level iii search. for your level iii, you gotta have e-4 authorization.  i don't have it.
thanks.  for everything.
no sweat.
when'd you start working here?
roger got me on.  i wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  i would have come to memphis, but --
i wanted to come here.
i've got all this back pay coming.  why don't you let me get you a place in town?
this is my home.  i'm part of the wallpaper.
what a journey you've had.  it seems more than a person should have to bear.
the tide saved me, mom.  i lived by it. i'm just wondering where it will take me next.
you came on a bicycle?  no wonder it's so late.
there was an unavoidable delay.
well, i have to say, i'm impressed.  you never gave up.
no.
you know what happened to this?
as much as anybody.
want to come in?  get dry for a minute.
okay.  sure.
hmmm.  feels like it might have gotten wet.
possible.  so you did those wings?
yeah.  a long time ago.
they're harder to do than they look.
oh?  you've tried?
well, i do a little drawing --
our apologies that it never made it to the recipient.
he was a sorry sonofabitch, and i'm sorry i ever married him.
i can't believe this.  i -- i -- they are... you're a gifted artist.  you're into something very powerful.  primal. truly.
well, not really, i --
you are.  yes you are.  what gave you the idea to paint on that cave?
to tell you the truth -- you did.
do you...have any more packages to deliver?
no.  that was the last one.
just sit here, i'll get us some lunch.
keep painting.  promise me.
sure.
need some help?
you bet i do.  high tide comes right up to this road.
you're not out of pascagoula, are you?
no.
i used to drive one of those.  a long time ago.
hey, once a driver, always a driver.  you want a lift?  i've just got one more pickup.
sure.
you're chuck noland.
yeah.
did you really steal a crippled kid's bicycle to make your deliveries, or is that just some bullshit story?
i didn't steal it, and he wasn't crippled.
what brings you out to the sticks?
had a package to deliver.
you?  personally?
i had it on the island with me.
must be a story there.
yeah, a long one.
i've got lots of time.
so do i.
