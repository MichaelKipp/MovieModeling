hey, what is wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
had kind of a long night.
dan keeping you up again?  put a lock on that window, girl.
no, the dan part was nice...
these things are wild...  what do you think?
makes you look like a nun--
yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
next life.  oh, what is that?
my undying love.  have some.
give up, mark, it is hopeless.
i think I am starting to wear her down.  have some anyway.
meet me later.  milkshakes.  cherry pie. banana splits.  and no mom!
pimples, heartburn, cellulite... and no modeling career.
not to mention the heartbreak of psoriasis.
greta, come on.  one burger with me?
good to see you again, mr. grey.  I have got to go find dan.
yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
hi, beautiful.
jesus!  do not do that!
sorry, babe.
the tickets.
they are coach seats, but the plane lands in paris.  it is going to be a helluva summer, hon!
i know.
okay, babe.  what is the matter?
nothing...it's just...i did not see my father at the ceremony.
he will show up.  c'mon, what is really wrong?
about him?
no.  well, not exactly...it's that...i felt like i was not in control.  for the first time since...all that.  I am scared.
you stopped it did not you?  it was probably just a regular bad dream.
yeah...i guess.
you do not dream him up, he can not hurt you.  or me.  or us.  remember...
you are right.
there you go.  love you.
me too.
excuse us, dear.
it is okay, dan
that club sucks, they card everybody. let's just party at your place.
you know my mother -- get real.  what about alice's?
my dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
well we gotta do something!
all right kids, i tell you what we are going to do.  I have got swimming practice until six-thirty today...
yeah...
that means they are going to give me the key to the pool so i can lock up when I am done.
i was afraid you were not coming.
i watched from behind the stands.  did not want to embarrass you, ya know.  "the drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
that is in the past.  unless you have stopped going to the meetings.
no.  a deal's a deal.
dad!
it is the model you have been saving up for. i wanted you to have it for your trip.
where are we going?
to take a picture.
thanks for everything, dad.
you sure you do not want a ride to work?
it is just across the park.
dan.  and he is taking alice with him -- pretty good dive yvonne.  you have been practicing.
two hours a day, six days a week.
have another one, sounds like you need it.
naah, I am done.  got to be on shift in a couple hours.  are not you going in?
nah.  it is getting too cold for me, and my wonderful mother will kill me if i screw up my hair.  she is got some model agency guy coming to dinner tomorrow night.
he is right.  sometimes i feel like I am living with melicertes.
who?
oh, he was this ancient guy i read about who like, killed his kids 'cause they did not want to run the kingdom the way he thought they should.
oh man!  i could have gone all night without looking at that.
i do not believe this... all that gore you paint in the comics and you are squeamish?
vomit?
faint.
it was no accident.  it was krueger.  he used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore.  he is found some other way.
alice, it is no dream.  I am sorry...dan's dead.
I am so sorry, honey...
daddy, he is coming back...krueger's coming back.  make them understand.
hey...wake up.
huh?
should not you be in your room, jacob?
it is lonely in there, in my room.
my name is...
I am sorry your boyfriend got killed.
how did you know that?
i could tell you were sad.  i just wanted to see if you were all right.
have you visited the little boy on my floor?  jacob, the one who looks kind of sad?
there are not any little boys on your floor.
he must have wandered up from the children's ward.  i just wondered what was wrong with him.
did everyone call everyone?
they are waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
I have got to write some of this down.
that is why it is my fault dan's dead.
stop saying that, it is bullshit.
i want to talk about the baby.
look.  dan's parents were pushing him. pushing him hard.  he was bitching about it at the party last night.  he was under pressure.  we all are.
pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.
what is that got to do with it?
when dan died you were not even asleep. you said so.  end of story.
bottom line, alice.  anybody, supernatural or not, that wants to hurt you - he will have to go through us first.
all of us.  right?
how was the meeting?
sobering...
very funny.
alice...
since when are you such a smart shopper?
since my little girl became a mom...
you disappointed in me?
no, I am not.  i sort of hope it is a boy. be nice to have a boy playing in the house again.
mark, are you okay?
yeah.  I am just aces.
i want to talk to both you guys about greta.  and...
I am very fucking sorry, but greta is dead today.  could we interest you in someone else?
it was just an accident.  like with dan.
no accident.  i tried to warn all of you about krueger.
i thought about that.
she must have fallen asleep at the table...
i do not understand what is happening. krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to dan and greta while i was awake. how is he doing it?
why do not you two stick to reality.
why do not you shut up and let her talk! two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
mark...
I am not finished - i loved greta.  a lot. and if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I would like to hear about it!
i can not listen to this.
then get out!
mark!
it is okay.
stick around, please?
do you think I am an idiot...for being in love with her?
nobody thinks that.
maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that polly perfect shit.
it was not her mother.  the only reason we are still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
tell me some more about this krueger guy.
why do not i go make some coffee.  there is a lot to tell.
hi, you do not look very well.  are you feeling all right?
been having bad dreams.
is that who you are waiting for?
no...
i do not think this is a nice place for you to be.  maybe we should go find your mom.
she does not want me around
oh...i'm sure that is not true.  I will bet she is very worried about you.  i would be.
no you are not.  you do not even care about being a mom.  how come you do not think about me?
who said i...wait, what?
who says i do not like you?
my friend, with the funny hand.
who is jacob?
my baby!
what, you named it already?
whoa, slow down.  how're you going to hide from a guy like that, leave the planet?
i do not know!
where are you going?
I am going to see what else i can find out about mr. fred krueger
you had me scared on the phone.  what is wrong with the baby?
i think krueger's trying to do something to it.
oh, alice...no.  honey, i love you but you are going to have to get a hold of yourself...
mark knows I am not crazy.  ask him to show you his hands.
i really think you need to calm down now, okay?
i just can not figure out how he is getting in when I am awake...
i am your friend, and I am worried sick about you.  but, you are like a locked safe.  you have got to start dealing with reality.
krueger is reality.
and so is your baby.  you have got more than just yourself to think of now!
what do you think I am doing?  look.  whether you believe it or not, krueger is back.  he is after the baby and if i do not try to do something about it, who will??
all i know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman.  why do not you take off - leave springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
goddamn it, yvonne!  you do not just run away from this guy!  he finds you in your dreams.
you, too?
he invited me to his house last night.
look...we're all tired.  none of us had any sleep since friday night...
that is the only reason you are alive...
i could not do that, mark.  he is my last link with dan...no, i want him.
then we will find another way.
frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
what i what?  well, I have thought about it.  i plan to keep him.
look, i appreciate what you are offering, but no.  he is my responsibility.
and ours.  it is our grandchild.
in your present condition, alice, we are worried about your ability --
what are you talking about?  my "condition"?...
we know you have been through a lot but there is more than your feelings at stake here.
you are not taking my baby!
they think I am nuts.
that is their problem.
no, it is our problem, mark.  if i do not deal with this, they really might try to take jacob.  you said she committed suicide?
that is what the newspapers thought.  she spent the rest of her life in the asylum. after krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
meaning?
they could not prove it.  no body!  nuns bumping themselves off is bad for business.
but I have seen her grave.
empty plot.  memorial stone.  vacant. they never did put her under.  cool, huh?
poor woman...
no shit.
i do not understand.
she killed herself.  her soul's going to be in torment.
are you alright?
yeah...so that is him.  and you are not crazy.
you think that is the place she is buried?
if they actually bothered to bury her.
what?
jacob.  we have got to get to amanda before it is too late.
but how are we gonna --
we have got to go to the asylum and find her body.  mark said her soul's trapped with it -- that is why she can not come to me.  it must be!
alice!
I have got to go.
no!  i will not have you running around in the middle of the night.  you are coming home.
but dad --
now.
mommy...?
come on downstairs.  he will not hurt you. he needs us both.
where is he?
he is inside you, where he hides.
what do you mean?
it is where he hides out.  inside.  that is how he found me.
but how...?
he says it is easy.  especially with sad people.  with closed-off people.
you do good work, alice.
so did dan.
he sure loves to stay awake.
that is okay.  he is got the rest of his life to catch up on his sleep.
