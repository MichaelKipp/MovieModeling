yes...
chet, i am calling you from portland... oregon.
ok, gordon.
no, it's oregon, portland, oregon. it's regional bureau chief cole. out in portland oregon. i need you out here, chet.
ok, gordon.
oregon. a young girl has been murdered. seventeen years old. named teresa banks.
okay, gordon!!!
got a map of the environs of the yakima indian reservation with your name on it. better bring a pole.
smell something fishy, huh?
i've got a surprise for you, chet. something interesting that i would like to show you. arrangements are being made and i will meet you at the portland, airport.
congratulations. i heard about that.
your surprise, chet. her name is lil.
good luck, chet.  sam, you stick with chet, he's got his own m.o. modus operandi.  you can reach me at the philadelphia offices. i am flying out today.
right, gordon. we'll be in touch.
that was really something.  that dancing girl.  what did it mean?
code. if you work with gordon you learn that right away.
code, i've heard a lot about this.
sort of shorthand.
shorthand. really?
we're heading into a difficult situation.
how do you figure?
i'll explain it to you. do you remember lil's dance?
lil was wearing a sour face.
what do you mean?
her face had a sour look... that means we're going to have trouble with the local authorities. they are not going to be receptive to the fbi.
oh, the uncle is missing.
not cole's uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
so the sheriff had got an uncle who's committed a serious crime.
right, which is probably why lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. let me ask you something, stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
the dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. i noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. it wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
gordon said you were good. the tailored dress is our code for drugs. did you notice what was pinned to it?
a blue rose.
very good, but i can't tell you about that.
what did gordon's tie mean?
what? that's just gordon's bad taste.
why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
he talks loud. and he loves his code.
i see. he does talk loud.
gordon would not have sent us to deer meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
it must be a high priority situation.
okay, that's it. i've had enough of the waiting room now.
oh.
i'm here to investigate the murder of teresa banks.
well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. i don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. in fact, when the state boys called me about a "j. edgar" coming up i think i said, "so what?"
your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the federal government.
you're lucky i am not wasting you.
well, little fella, let me put it this way. the operative word here would be "federal". with or without the semantics of all this, i am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning teresa banks, both while living and deceased.
a basic kill. banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. my boys have been all over this. it's a dead end.
that's why we're here, sheriff cable. where's the body?
out back in our morgue.
it's 4:30. we close at five.
we've got our own clock. we'll lock up.
solved the whiteman case with this.
that's what i heard.
no one could find those splinters without a machine like this. and no one had a machine like this.
that's good.
yes, it is good.  what do you think is in these other drawers?
i don't know, sam.
maybe, later we could take a look.
sure, but let's finish up with this first.
crushed skull. probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
cole said she was 17.
there appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.
oh.
accidental?
agent desmond, would you hold the finger for me. there's something up there.
what is it?
it is a piece of paper with the letter "t" imprinted on it. take a look.
geez, agent desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. where are we going to sleep?
we're not. you and i are going to get some food.
yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. i didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, agent desmond?
had the fbi here once before. back in the fifties when hap was running the place.
where's hap?
he's dead -- good and dead.
sorry to hear it.
he didn't suffer.
i'd like to ask you a few questions about teresa banks
sheriff cable's already asked me a few questions about teresa banks. she worked nights for a month. that's it.
any friends?
no.
ever see her with someone else?
no.
did she ever mention any friends?
no.  ask irene over there.
take a good look around. there's nobody in this place -- you're meetin' the reason why. what'll it be?
how come jack let's you work here?
jack and i are united in holy matrimony.
say no more.
federal bureau of investigation, special agent chet desmond. i'd like to ask you a few questions about teresa banks. jack said you knew her. how well?
she only worked here a month. nice girl. never seemed to get here on time though. ask me she had a little problem with --
came looking for a job with a friend of hers. pretty girl. could've been her sister.
what happened to her?
there was only one job. teresa took the job. her friend took a hike. never saw her again.
did you ever see teresa take cocaine?
no.
do you take cocaine, irene?
no, i do not. i never took cocaine or any other drugs. i don't take drugs.
he's with me.  anything you would like to tell us about teresa banks that would help us out?
i've thought about that. i think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
thanks.
agent desmond, it's...
it's late, sam.
it's not late, it's early. really early.
you know, i never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, teresa's arm went completely dead.
what do you mean?
her left arm. it was numb. she said she couldn't use it. said it had no feeling. probably from the drugs she was taking.  i just thought i ought to tell you.
thanks.
i doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. i could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to portland.
i think that's a good idea.
i think we should see the sun rise at the canyon trailer park.
are you speaking to me in a code?
no, sam, i'm speaking plainly and i mean just exactly what i say.
in that case, we should go to the canyon trailer park.
federal bureau of investigation, special agent chet desmond and agent sam stanley. sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see teresa banks' trailer, please.
more popular than uncle's day at a whorehouse.  god damn, that morning sun is bright! blue bright.
mrs. simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. teresa rented it about a month ago.
did she have someone with her?
right. she had a friend with her. the friend took off.
was there an argument?
not that i know of. but arguments do happen, don't they?
yes they do. did she have visitors?
no, hey, i already told this whole damn thing to sheriff "not-quite- able"... here's the trailer now.
she lived alone.
she must have known someone.
you better dust this place, sam.
i'll get my kit.
take a look at this.
she's wearing a ring.
my guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
may i see the magnifying glass, agent desmond?  there doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
you weren't kiddin'. this stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
that's right. that's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
what are you doing here in the trailer court, deputy?
maybe i just live here, what do you think about that?
can i ask you where you were the night teresa banks was murdered?
you can tell j. edgar that i was at a party and i got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
did you know teresa banks?
got a couple of cups of coffee at hap's from her. that's it. by the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? i could ask you the same question.
no you couldn't.
is there a golf course around here?
not a lot around here, no. got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
thanks for your help, carl. sorry we woke you up.
that's alright. i was having a bad dream. i was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
i couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that deputy cliff was the murderer. you did think that, didn't you, agent desmond?
he's not the murderer.  but he's a bozo.
yes, he is like a clown.
what the hell is that thing doing out there? you're not taking that body anywhere.
we're taking the body back to portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
teresa banks had a ring. any idea what happened to it?
we got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
sam, get the body and put it in the van.  sheriff cable, where were you the night teresa banks was murdered?
my alibi is as strong as these bands of steel.
when he says, "discussion", how do you take that, agent desmond?
i don't take it, sam. i give it.
you try that you little monkey.
i think i'll take off my badge as well.
one thing that has been troubling me. that lamp at the diner. do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
faulty wiring.
esthetics are subjective, aren't they, agent desmond?  i'm sam stanley. if you ever need me.
thanks, sam, for the good work. you have a good eye for detail.
we do notice things, don't we, agent desmond? are you going back to the trailer park for the blue rose?
what is it, gordon?
coop, agent chet desmond has disappeared. gone like the wind in deer meadow.
agent chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. he had me drive the van with the body back here. which we did. it was 105 miles.
anything else?
did gordon show you a woman named lil?
i'm up to speed, stanley.
agent chet wouldn't tell me what the blue rose meant.
and neither will i.
oh, alright.  you know, i liked agent desmond. he had his own m.o.
i cracked the whiteman case with this.
stanley, i heard all about it.
no one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
tell me about the letter.
take a look at this. chet and i found it under teresa banks' ring fingernail.
and no one found the ring?
no, sir, we did not.
god. i'm beginning to lose faith in the united states government and that includes the telephone system. don't you folks talk to one another. that's her trailer there and i haven't touched a god damn thing. agent chet desmond come by a second time and asked too see deputy cliff howard's trailer  ...which i showed him. i went back to my trailer...  after that i never saw him again.
thank you, carl.
that's not the way to cliff's trailer. i told you.
i am not going to cliff's trailer.
well, where are you going?
i am going over here.
god damn, you people are confusing.
what was here, mr. rodd?
a trailer was here. what the hell do you think?
can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
an old woman and her grandson.
can you tell me what their names were?
chalfont. weird. chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. two chalfonts.
is that agent desmond's vehicle?
yep, it sure is.
phillip?
cooper, meet the long lost phillip jeffries. you may have heard of him at the academy.
he's gone.
what?
albert, come back here. he's gone call the front desk.
quickly men... word association, coop. what are you thinking about right now?
teresa banks.
albert?
it was a year ago today that teresa banks was killed. i'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
albert, why tylenol?
if i am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
you didn't do your homework?
noooo...
okay, this test is going to be about the theorems i told you about last week. you remember the...
don't tell me now. tell me right before the test. i won't be able to remember long enough.
you graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
thanks.
james called me last night looking for you.
when?
the usual, 9:15.
he probably wanted to drive over.
were you with bobby? or are you two still fighting?
no, and yes. i don't know what i'm going to do about bobby. i know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks i'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
i don't know what to do.
you know what your problem is?  you're just too adorable...
you know, i think you're right. i'm just too adorable.
laura palmer, you're just too adorable.
i'm just too adorable. i'm just too adorable.
james...
laura, i'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
okay.
laura, do you love me?
yes, i love you. i've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
why? it does.
no, it doesn't... just kiss me.
it does matter. we're in love.
james, you don't know what you are talking about. quit trying to hold on so tight. i'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
you're not a turkey. a turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
gobble, gobble, gobble.
where were you for the last hour? i've been lookin' for you?
i was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  if he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.
i'm not kiddin'. where were you? who were you with?
get lost bobby.
oh, yeah? you'll be callin' soon and maybe i'm not gonna be there.
oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
are you going to see james tonight?
why are you suddenly so interested in who i am going to see at night? nighttime is my time.
you're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see bobby, are you?
maybe.
oh god, laura.
well, why not?
because bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. he's a goon.  james is the one.  he loves you with that "lasting love"... "true love".
yes, james is very sweet. why don't you get out your violin, donna?
sweet? god, he's gorgeous.
james is very sweet and very gorgeous.
do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
faster and faster. for a long time you wouldn't feel anything. then you would burst into fire... forever.
maybe i better start our homework.
okay, i suppose i should go home.
call me.
sure. what do you want me to call you?
call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
can i take the car?
sure honey, what's the hurry?
i forgot my books at school.
laura.
what?
my secret diary. there are pages missing.
who would do that?
bob.
but bob isn't real.
the pages are gone. that's real.
maybe.
bob is real. he's been "having" me since i was 12.
the diary was hidden too well. he's the only one who could know where it was. he's getting to know me, now. he's real. he speaks to me.
what does bob say?
he wants to be me... or he will kill me.
no... no...
oh, yes... yes...
you're not bob are you, harold? if you are, you can kill me right now. kill me right now, if you are.
laura, no, i'm not. i'm not bob.  poor laura. i wish i could help you.
i hate him, i hate it. sometimes i love it. but now i'm afraid. i am so afraid.
but you're strong laura... so much stronger than i... how can i help you? i can't. i can't even go outside.
what about james? can't james help you? you two are so in love.
he's in love with a girl who's dead.  it is dangerous for you to have it. i'm sorry.
i'm so sorry, laura.
you lied to me about those school books. i found them upstairs on your bed.
what were you doing in my room?
i was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which i found balled up in the bottom of your closet. now why did you lie to me? where did you go?
i had to see bobby. i know you really don't like bobby, but there was a problem and i didn't think you would understand.
oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. ever. you can tell me anything. i'll understand.
i'm sorry, mom.
now hurry, dinner's almost ready. your father says he's starving.
hello, laura. hello sarah. where's my axe?  "i'm hungry".
oh, leland.
dad.
hyggelig a mote dem. jeg heter leland palmer.
the norwegians are coming next week and i want you to learn to say what i just learned in norwegian. so you can talk to them. i want you to learn to say, "hello, my name is leland palmer".
but my name isn't leland palmer.
neither is mine. and can't we talk about something serious for a change.
this is serious. mr. benjamin horne's got a delegation of norwegians coming in next week and i want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. sarah, you first.
cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. do you honestly think cole's practice of word association works?
the very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. the world is a hologram, albert.
yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, cooper?
albert.
you said, "teresa banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
yes. either right now or right when i thought of it. the name and memory of teresa banks is haunting me. lately i have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. because it is only a feeling, i am powerless to stop it. and another thing, albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
let's test it for the record. will the next victim be a man or a woman?
a woman.
what color hair will she have?
blonde.
tell me some other things about her.
she's in high school. she's sexually active. she's on drugs. she's crying out for some help.
you're describing half the high school girls in america.  what is she doing right now?
she is preparing a great abundance of food.
shelly, would you give laura a quick hand with the "meals on wheels"?
i'm kind of busy, norma.
you're not busy, sweetheart, now go.
laura just took off. she asked me to do the run today. should i do it?
what's with that laura? yeah, sure, take a look around. there's no one here anyway.
you're right. there's no one here.
there's no one here.
norma, are you alright?
come back as soon as you can.
if leo comes here, he won't believe that i am out doing the "meals on wheels".
don't worry, shelly, i'll handle leo.
laura?
donna, are you my best friend?
of course...
what is it laura? what's wrong?
i just want a friend. just one friend for just one minute...
laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
yes, that's what i want. thanks d.
okay, l.  i am your friend... always. but sometimes... lately... i feel that you don't like being around me because i am so uptight.  no, i am uptight. i hate it... i don't want to be this way, but laura i don't... i mean... i'm your friend no matter what way you are.
you know, even when i think about your face i get happier.
do you want to talk?
no, i want to smoke.
i'm in a mess today, too.  i'm thinking about doing it with mike. what do you think?
donna, you are such a crack up. you don't even like mike. is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
this is about sex, not like.  mom, laura's here and i think i will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  you want a muffin?
if i can smoke it.
you want a muffin?
donna, you are a muffin.
goodbye, muffin.
no, you're the muffin.
hi, honey, how's donna?
fine.
school?
...school's fine...
sit down... sit down... are you hungry?
not really.
let me see.
dad...
your hands are filthy... look, there is dirt way under this fingernail.
leland, what are you doing?
look at this finger here.
leland...
laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  and look at this.
did you get this from your lover?
they don't call them lovers in high school, leland.
bobby didn't give you this?
how would you know if bobby didn't give her that?
did bobby give you that or is there someone new?
leland leave her alone... she doesn't like that. stop it.
how do you know what she doesn't like?
oh, leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
oh, i'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till laura goes and washes her hands.
where were you last night? we were supposed to get together. you didn't show up.
you were supposed to show up. maybe i wasn't.
we were supposed to be together.
how can i be together if i'm not together?
you're on somethin' again, aren't you?
james...
when am i going to see you?
who was that?
a friend from school.
a special friend?
no... no, go away.
i'm glad you let me talk to you. you used to not let me talk to you.
go away. i am not talking to you.
i want you.
laura, now i can't find that blue sweater. did you take it again?
mom... what are you wearing?
my god, i am going to have another breakdown. god, god.
mom, take it easy.
someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. shelly, i know where everything in this house is. sometimes on the road i mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
lay off the bennies, leo.
anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere. to really clean, you have to scrub below the surface.  where the dirt is, shelly.
that's one thing you are going to learn, shelly, -- how to clean. it takes scrubbing, shelly. there is no easy way. this is where we live, shelly.
as if i didn't know.
i'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
come off it, leo. i'm late for work...
what did you say?
where are you going?
no place, fast.  and you're not coming.
come on, laura. i'm your best friend.
isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with mike?
laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
where are the cookies?
you mean fred and ginger?
dancing.
if i had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, i'd be dead.
gotta go, donna. i'll call you tomorrow.
what are you doing?
nothing.
no.  i don't need to take this to be your friend.
yes you do, donna. what a downer you are!!!
baby, you know why? cause it'll never get here.
hey, jacques...
no "jacques". i am the great went.
i am the muffin.
and what a muffin you have.
that's right. she called me. she even asked me what your fathers looked like...
what? she asked about my father?
but it wasn't him... she was after a huge guy, six foot four with a broken nose. she said he looked just like a boxer. speaking of sandwiches... i think bobby was arranging something for you...  speaking of arrangements...  speaking of arrangements... why don't you two come up to the cabin this week? leo and i know that santy claus is coming to town... thursday.
see what we can do to donna?
no! god, no...
don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. never.
okay, i won't wear your stuff... why can't i wear your stuff?
jacques, help me get her home. now!
i won't wear your stuff.  i promise.
not you, donna, not you.
josie, i think we should go public.
that would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since andrew died.
what are you afraid of? what people think?
i don't want to offend the customs of your country.
believe me, josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. for instance, i don't eat fish eyes.
fish eyes?
even if it offended someone, i wouldn't eat a fish eye.
why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, harry?
i saw a guy eat a fish eye once in seattle. he was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat. i guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble. his throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing. and he couldn't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a heimlich maneuver. i went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy. they were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling. splat! it just stuck up there and spread out. it was about the size of a half dollar. and that's why i don't ever eat fish eyes.
i'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way i feel. it's the custom thing i was thinking of. in america we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. we throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
i understand.
we throw away the whole head.
i can't remember anything about last night. is there something i should remember?
no, you should forget about last night.
laura, i am your friend.
i know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
you're not mad at me?
no.
i feel so bad. i had nightmares all night long.  they all knew you at that place.
what can i tell you?
how did the car get back here?
we got it back, that's all.
how did i get in the house? how did i get into my bed?
i can't help you there.
was i wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
all my things have me in them. i don't want you to be like me.
but i love you, laura.
and i love you, too. but don't wear my stuff.
why do you do it, laura?
cause i like it.
when's the next business trip, big fella?
soon. how about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
i can arrange that. i like that.
what are you doing?
who am i?
i don't know.
that's right.
dad... dad... who was that? how do you know him? he looked familiar. have i met him?
no, you haven't met him. have you met him?
no.
we're late to get to your mother.
just sit here for a moment. you seem very upset.
guy just pulls up out of the blue... i mean... what is this world coming to?
what's wrong?
nothing, i chickened out.
are you sure you're okay?
yes.
dad?
yes.
did you come home during the day last week?
no.
oh, i thought i saw you.
you know, i did come home, come to think of it, on thursday. i had a severe headache and i was driving in the neighborhood so i just darted in and out of the house.  where were you, laura? i didn't see you?
i was down the street.
that's not important. i will tell you what is important. the fan will soon be starting.
who are you? who are you really?
i am the one who wants to breathe thru your nose and taste thru your mouth.
i'm nearly out.
it's taken care of, babe. you and i are going to make a big score tonight.  this will tide you over.
thank you, bobby. a big score?
maybe our biggest. i'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
don't be late.
i've got to see you.
not now.
this afternoon?
okay.  oh god, it's johnny horne's birthday today.
what about tonight?
i can't tonight.
what's going on?
i just can't, james. i can't do it.
johnny, johnny... let your daddy and your uncle and leland talk.  ben... leland, we can play the french against the norwegians. what do the french love more than anything?
boating?
no.
hiking?
no.
eating?
you'd think so.
sex?
you're getting warmer.
trees?
exactment. they are nuts about wood. they get goofy over trees.
history is on our side, ben. it's no accident that the great explorers were named hennepin, nicollet, marquette.
they were looking for wood.
hey, pete. can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.
no... hell, no. just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "e" starin' at me.
you know what that big "e" stands for? big ed's gas farm.
yep. you're right. that's why i'm here.
what'll it be?
fill 'er up.
you got it.
i haven't got it yet.
nice night.
yep...  yes...  it is.
you missed somethin', ed.
i did? i didn't see anything.
yeah... look in here. look at it from this angle.
even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.
brother, i hear you talkin'.
here he comes.
here he comes.
this isn't mike.  is this mike?
bobby... ssshhhh... you killed mike.
no.
i want you to kill for me.
no. never. you'll have to kill me.
i want you to kill for me.
babe, i'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. put this cash in your safety deposit box...  it's ten thousand dollars.
you killed mike.
laura, you didn't come and see me today.
i couldn't it was johnny horne's birthday. i promised i'd be with him. i told you not to call me here.
a little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something i am certainly willing to put up with.
i'm not.
did you make me a tape?
i already made you two tapes.
laura, you have to deal with all of this.
i'm dealing with it, doc. big time. maybe i'll make you a tape tomorrow. goodnight.
send me a kiss.
laura. what's wrong this morning?
stay away from me.
i hate asparagus.
sure you do, it's good for you.
where's dad?
ben asked him to stay late to plan for the norwegians.
if it's okay with you i'm going to bobby's to do my homework.
it's a school night... back by nine.
bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
what was?
the stuff we got last night.
baby laxative? we can't snort baby laxative.
no shit...  we killed a guy for baby laxative.
what is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
don't get funny with me again.
i'm not... bobby i'm gonna need some more stuff. i mean it. i'm out.
yeah, and i'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
sure, but i can't get it till after school tomorrow.
let's ditch this place and party.
not tonight. just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
why? why not? where are you goin'?
we can do it right here.
bobby...
bobby's got it.
thanks, bobby.  and my little round friends, too.
good night, mom.
good night, sweetheart.
what the hell is wrong with you?
that's right. there's no place left to go is there, james?
what do you mean?
you know it and i know it.
what is wrong with us?... we have everything.
everything, but everything.
oh, laura.
"oh, laura..."
you always hurt the ones you love.
you mean the ones you pity.
say anything you want... i know you love me and i love you.
i do love you.  let's get lost together.
shit, maybe he'll kill you.
what?
when he finds out.
what?
bobby killed a guy.
what are you talking about? bobby didn't kill anybody.
you want to see...
see what?
right. open your eyes, james. you don't know me. even donna doesn't know me. your laura disappeared... it's just me now.
right on time, baby.
buy me a ticket to the great went.
we're on our way, baby.
let's go all the way.
don't make me do it.
no, you have to kill me.
i always thought you knew it was me.
no! you can't have me.  kill me.
where is the ring?
someone else has it now.
that would indicate that it's the future.
the later events have never been kept a secret.
where am i? and how can i leave?
you are here and there is no place to go...
yes...
chet, i am calling you from portland... oregon.
ok, gordon.
no, it's oregon, portland, oregon. it's regional bureau chief cole. out in portland oregon. i need you out here, chet.
ok, gordon.
oregon. a young girl has been murdered. seventeen years old. named teresa banks.
okay, gordon!!!
got a map of the environs of the yakima indian reservation with your name on it. better bring a pole.
smell something fishy, huh?
i've got a surprise for you, chet. something interesting that i would like to show you. arrangements are being made and i will meet you at the portland, airport.
congratulations. i heard about that.
your surprise, chet. her name is lil.
good luck, chet.  sam, you stick with chet, he's got his own m.o. modus operandi.  you can reach me at the philadelphia offices. i am flying out today.
right, gordon. we'll be in touch.
that was really something.  that dancing girl.  what did it mean?
code. if you work with gordon you learn that right away.
code, i've heard a lot about this.
sort of shorthand.
shorthand. really?
we're heading into a difficult situation.
how do you figure?
i'll explain it to you. do you remember lil's dance?
lil was wearing a sour face.
what do you mean?
her face had a sour look... that means we're going to have trouble with the local authorities. they are not going to be receptive to the fbi.
oh, the uncle is missing.
not cole's uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
so the sheriff had got an uncle who's committed a serious crime.
right, which is probably why lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. let me ask you something, stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
the dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. i noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. it wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.
gordon said you were good. the tailored dress is our code for drugs. did you notice what was pinned to it?
a blue rose.
very good, but i can't tell you about that.
what did gordon's tie mean?
what? that's just gordon's bad taste.
why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
he talks loud. and he loves his code.
i see. he does talk loud.
gordon would not have sent us to deer meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
it must be a high priority situation.
okay, that's it. i've had enough of the waiting room now.
oh.
i'm here to investigate the murder of teresa banks.
well, little fella, we don't need any outside help here. i don't like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. in fact, when the state boys called me about a "j. edgar" coming up i think i said, "so what?"
your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the federal government.
you're lucky i am not wasting you.
well, little fella, let me put it this way. the operative word here would be "federal". with or without the semantics of all this, i am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning teresa banks, both while living and deceased.
a basic kill. banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. my boys have been all over this. it's a dead end.
that's why we're here, sheriff cable. where's the body?
out back in our morgue.
it's 4:30. we close at five.
we've got our own clock. we'll lock up.
solved the whiteman case with this.
that's what i heard.
no one could find those splinters without a machine like this. and no one had a machine like this.
that's good.
yes, it is good.  what do you think is in these other drawers?
i don't know, sam.
maybe, later we could take a look.
sure, but let's finish up with this first.
crushed skull. probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
cole said she was 17.
there appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.
oh.
accidental?
agent desmond, would you hold the finger for me. there's something up there.
what is it?
it is a piece of paper with the letter "t" imprinted on it. take a look.
geez, agent desmond, it's three-thirty in the morning. where are we going to sleep?
we're not. you and i are going to get some food.
yes, it's been several hours since we've eaten. i didn't realize that so much time had past, did you, agent desmond?
had the fbi here once before. back in the fifties when hap was running the place.
where's hap?
he's dead -- good and dead.
sorry to hear it.
he didn't suffer.
i'd like to ask you a few questions about teresa banks
sheriff cable's already asked me a few questions about teresa banks. she worked nights for a month. that's it.
any friends?
no.
ever see her with someone else?
no.
did she ever mention any friends?
no.  ask irene over there.
take a good look around. there's nobody in this place -- you're meetin' the reason why. what'll it be?
how come jack let's you work here?
jack and i are united in holy matrimony.
say no more.
federal bureau of investigation, special agent chet desmond. i'd like to ask you a few questions about teresa banks. jack said you knew her. how well?
she only worked here a month. nice girl. never seemed to get here on time though. ask me she had a little problem with --
came looking for a job with a friend of hers. pretty girl. could've been her sister.
what happened to her?
there was only one job. teresa took the job. her friend took a hike. never saw her again.
did you ever see teresa take cocaine?
no.
do you take cocaine, irene?
no, i do not. i never took cocaine or any other drugs. i don't take drugs.
he's with me.  anything you would like to tell us about teresa banks that would help us out?
i've thought about that. i think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
thanks.
agent desmond, it's...
it's late, sam.
it's not late, it's early. really early.
you know, i never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, teresa's arm went completely dead.
what do you mean?
her left arm. it was numb. she said she couldn't use it. said it had no feeling. probably from the drugs she was taking.  i just thought i ought to tell you.
thanks.
i doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. i could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to portland.
i think that's a good idea.
i think we should see the sun rise at the canyon trailer park.
are you speaking to me in a code?
no, sam, i'm speaking plainly and i mean just exactly what i say.
in that case, we should go to the canyon trailer park.
federal bureau of investigation, special agent chet desmond and agent sam stanley. sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see teresa banks' trailer, please.
more popular than uncle's day at a whorehouse.  god damn, that morning sun is bright! blue bright.
mrs. simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. teresa rented it about a month ago.
did she have someone with her?
right. she had a friend with her. the friend took off.
was there an argument?
not that i know of. but arguments do happen, don't they?
yes they do. did she have visitors?
no, hey, i already told this whole damn thing to sheriff "not-quite- able"... here's the trailer now.
she lived alone.
she must have known someone.
you better dust this place, sam.
i'll get my kit.
take a look at this.
she's wearing a ring.
my guess is there isn't enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
may i see the magnifying glass, agent desmond?  there doesn't seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
you weren't kiddin'. this stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
that's right. that's the best coffee you're gonna get around here.
what are you doing here in the trailer court, deputy?
maybe i just live here, what do you think about that?
can i ask you where you were the night teresa banks was murdered?
you can tell j. edgar that i was at a party and i got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
did you know teresa banks?
got a couple of cups of coffee at hap's from her. that's it. by the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? i could ask you the same question.
no you couldn't.
is there a golf course around here?
not a lot around here, no. got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
thanks for your help, carl. sorry we woke you up.
that's alright. i was having a bad dream. i was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
i couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that deputy cliff was the murderer. you did think that, didn't you, agent desmond?
he's not the murderer.  but he's a bozo.
yes, he is like a clown.
what the hell is that thing doing out there? you're not taking that body anywhere.
we're taking the body back to portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
teresa banks had a ring. any idea what happened to it?
we got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
sam, get the body and put it in the van.  sheriff cable, where were you the night teresa banks was murdered?
my alibi is as strong as these bands of steel.
when he says, "discussion", how do you take that, agent desmond?
i don't take it, sam. i give it.
you try that you little monkey.
i think i'll take off my badge as well.
one thing that has been troubling me. that lamp at the diner. do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
faulty wiring.
esthetics are subjective, aren't they, agent desmond?  i'm sam stanley. if you ever need me.
thanks, sam, for the good work. you have a good eye for detail.
we do notice things, don't we, agent desmond? are you going back to the trailer park for the blue rose?
what is it, gordon?
coop, agent chet desmond has disappeared. gone like the wind in deer meadow.
agent chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. he had me drive the van with the body back here. which we did. it was 105 miles.
anything else?
did gordon show you a woman named lil?
i'm up to speed, stanley.
agent chet wouldn't tell me what the blue rose meant.
and neither will i.
oh, alright.  you know, i liked agent desmond. he had his own m.o.
i cracked the whiteman case with this.
stanley, i heard all about it.
no one could've found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
tell me about the letter.
take a look at this. chet and i found it under teresa banks' ring fingernail.
and no one found the ring?
no, sir, we did not.
god. i'm beginning to lose faith in the united states government and that includes the telephone system. don't you folks talk to one another. that's her trailer there and i haven't touched a god damn thing. agent chet desmond come by a second time and asked too see deputy cliff howard's trailer  ...which i showed him. i went back to my trailer...  after that i never saw him again.
thank you, carl.
that's not the way to cliff's trailer. i told you.
i am not going to cliff's trailer.
well, where are you going?
i am going over here.
god damn, you people are confusing.
what was here, mr. rodd?
a trailer was here. what the hell do you think?
can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
an old woman and her grandson.
can you tell me what their names were?
chalfont. weird. chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. two chalfonts.
is that agent desmond's vehicle?
yep, it sure is.
phillip?
cooper, meet the long lost phillip jeffries. you may have heard of him at the academy.
he's gone.
what?
albert, come back here. he's gone call the front desk.
quickly men... word association, coop. what are you thinking about right now?
teresa banks.
albert?
it was a year ago today that teresa banks was killed. i'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
albert, why tylenol?
if i am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
you didn't do your homework?
noooo...
okay, this test is going to be about the theorems i told you about last week. you remember the...
don't tell me now. tell me right before the test. i won't be able to remember long enough.
you graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
thanks.
james called me last night looking for you.
when?
the usual, 9:15.
he probably wanted to drive over.
were you with bobby? or are you two still fighting?
no, and yes. i don't know what i'm going to do about bobby. i know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks i'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
i don't know what to do.
you know what your problem is?  you're just too adorable...
you know, i think you're right. i'm just too adorable.
laura palmer, you're just too adorable.
i'm just too adorable. i'm just too adorable.
james...
laura, i'll meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
okay.
laura, do you love me?
yes, i love you. i've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
why? it does.
no, it doesn't... just kiss me.
it does matter. we're in love.
james, you don't know what you are talking about. quit trying to hold on so tight. i'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
you're not a turkey. a turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
gobble, gobble, gobble.
where were you for the last hour? i've been lookin' for you?
i was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around.  if he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.
i'm not kiddin'. where were you? who were you with?
get lost bobby.
oh, yeah? you'll be callin' soon and maybe i'm not gonna be there.
oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
are you going to see james tonight?
why are you suddenly so interested in who i am going to see at night? nighttime is my time.
you're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see bobby, are you?
maybe.
oh god, laura.
well, why not?
because bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. he's a goon.  james is the one.  he loves you with that "lasting love"... "true love".
yes, james is very sweet. why don't you get out your violin, donna?
sweet? god, he's gorgeous.
james is very sweet and very gorgeous.
do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
faster and faster. for a long time you wouldn't feel anything. then you would burst into fire... forever.
maybe i better start our homework.
okay, i suppose i should go home.
call me.
sure. what do you want me to call you?
call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
can i take the car?
sure honey, what's the hurry?
i forgot my books at school.
laura.
what?
my secret diary. there are pages missing.
who would do that?
bob.
but bob isn't real.
the pages are gone. that's real.
maybe.
bob is real. he's been "having" me since i was 12.
the diary was hidden too well. he's the only one who could know where it was. he's getting to know me, now. he's real. he speaks to me.
what does bob say?
he wants to be me... or he will kill me.
no... no...
oh, yes... yes...
you're not bob are you, harold? if you are, you can kill me right now. kill me right now, if you are.
laura, no, i'm not. i'm not bob.  poor laura. i wish i could help you.
i hate him, i hate it. sometimes i love it. but now i'm afraid. i am so afraid.
but you're strong laura... so much stronger than i... how can i help you? i can't. i can't even go outside.
what about james? can't james help you? you two are so in love.
he's in love with a girl who's dead.  it is dangerous for you to have it. i'm sorry.
i'm so sorry, laura.
you lied to me about those school books. i found them upstairs on your bed.
what were you doing in my room?
i was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which i found balled up in the bottom of your closet. now why did you lie to me? where did you go?
i had to see bobby. i know you really don't like bobby, but there was a problem and i didn't think you would understand.
oh, honey, you don't have to lie to me. ever. you can tell me anything. i'll understand.
i'm sorry, mom.
now hurry, dinner's almost ready. your father says he's starving.
hello, laura. hello sarah. where's my axe?  "i'm hungry".
oh, leland.
dad.
hyggelig a mote dem. jeg heter leland palmer.
the norwegians are coming next week and i want you to learn to say what i just learned in norwegian. so you can talk to them. i want you to learn to say, "hello, my name is leland palmer".
but my name isn't leland palmer.
neither is mine. and can't we talk about something serious for a change.
this is serious. mr. benjamin horne's got a delegation of norwegians coming in next week and i want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. sarah, you first.
cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. do you honestly think cole's practice of word association works?
the very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. the world is a hologram, albert.
yes, it's a great big psychedelic circus ride, isn't it, cooper?
albert.
you said, "teresa banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
yes. either right now or right when i thought of it. the name and memory of teresa banks is haunting me. lately i have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. because it is only a feeling, i am powerless to stop it. and another thing, albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
let's test it for the record. will the next victim be a man or a woman?
a woman.
what color hair will she have?
blonde.
tell me some other things about her.
she's in high school. she's sexually active. she's on drugs. she's crying out for some help.
you're describing half the high school girls in america.  what is she doing right now?
she is preparing a great abundance of food.
shelly, would you give laura a quick hand with the "meals on wheels"?
i'm kind of busy, norma.
you're not busy, sweetheart, now go.
laura just took off. she asked me to do the run today. should i do it?
what's with that laura? yeah, sure, take a look around. there's no one here anyway.
you're right. there's no one here.
there's no one here.
norma, are you alright?
come back as soon as you can.
if leo comes here, he won't believe that i am out doing the "meals on wheels".
don't worry, shelly, i'll handle leo.
laura?
donna, are you my best friend?
of course...
what is it laura? what's wrong?
i just want a friend. just one friend for just one minute...
laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
yes, that's what i want. thanks d.
okay, l.  i am your friend... always. but sometimes... lately... i feel that you don't like being around me because i am so uptight.  no, i am uptight. i hate it... i don't want to be this way, but laura i don't... i mean... i'm your friend no matter what way you are.
you know, even when i think about your face i get happier.
do you want to talk?
no, i want to smoke.
i'm in a mess today, too.  i'm thinking about doing it with mike. what do you think?
donna, you are such a crack up. you don't even like mike. is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
this is about sex, not like.  mom, laura's here and i think i will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  you want a muffin?
if i can smoke it.
you want a muffin?
donna, you are a muffin.
goodbye, muffin.
no, you're the muffin.
hi, honey, how's donna?
fine.
school?
...school's fine...
sit down... sit down... are you hungry?
not really.
let me see.
dad...
your hands are filthy... look, there is dirt way under this fingernail.
leland, what are you doing?
look at this finger here.
leland...
laura didn't wash her hands before dinner.  and look at this.
did you get this from your lover?
they don't call them lovers in high school, leland.
bobby didn't give you this?
how would you know if bobby didn't give her that?
did bobby give you that or is there someone new?
leland leave her alone... she doesn't like that. stop it.
how do you know what she doesn't like?
oh, leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
oh, i'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till laura goes and washes her hands.
where were you last night? we were supposed to get together. you didn't show up.
you were supposed to show up. maybe i wasn't.
we were supposed to be together.
how can i be together if i'm not together?
you're on somethin' again, aren't you?
james...
when am i going to see you?
who was that?
a friend from school.
a special friend?
no... no, go away.
i'm glad you let me talk to you. you used to not let me talk to you.
go away. i am not talking to you.
i want you.
laura, now i can't find that blue sweater. did you take it again?
mom... what are you wearing?
my god, i am going to have another breakdown. god, god.
mom, take it easy.
someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. shelly, i know where everything in this house is. sometimes on the road i mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
lay off the bennies, leo.
anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere. to really clean, you have to scrub below the surface.  where the dirt is, shelly.
that's one thing you are going to learn, shelly, -- how to clean. it takes scrubbing, shelly. there is no easy way. this is where we live, shelly.
as if i didn't know.
i'm going to show you how to wash this tile and then you're going to do it.
come off it, leo. i'm late for work...
what did you say?
where are you going?
no place, fast.  and you're not coming.
come on, laura. i'm your best friend.
isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with mike?
laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
where are the cookies?
you mean fred and ginger?
dancing.
if i had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, i'd be dead.
gotta go, donna. i'll call you tomorrow.
what are you doing?
nothing.
no.  i don't need to take this to be your friend.
yes you do, donna. what a downer you are!!!
baby, you know why? cause it'll never get here.
hey, jacques...
no "jacques". i am the great went.
i am the muffin.
and what a muffin you have.
that's right. she called me. she even asked me what your fathers looked like...
what? she asked about my father?
but it wasn't him... she was after a huge guy, six foot four with a broken nose. she said he looked just like a boxer. speaking of sandwiches... i think bobby was arranging something for you...  speaking of arrangements...  speaking of arrangements... why don't you two come up to the cabin this week? leo and i know that santy claus is coming to town... thursday.
see what we can do to donna?
no! god, no...
don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. never.
okay, i won't wear your stuff... why can't i wear your stuff?
jacques, help me get her home. now!
i won't wear your stuff.  i promise.
not you, donna, not you.
josie, i think we should go public.
that would be wonderful, but it's only been a year since andrew died.
what are you afraid of? what people think?
i don't want to offend the customs of your country.
believe me, josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. for instance, i don't eat fish eyes.
fish eyes?
even if it offended someone, i wouldn't eat a fish eye.
why wouldn't you eat a fish eye, harry?
i saw a guy eat a fish eye once in seattle. he was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat. i guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble. his throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing. and he couldn't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a heimlich maneuver. i went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy. they were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling. splat! it just stuck up there and spread out. it was about the size of a half dollar. and that's why i don't ever eat fish eyes.
i'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way i feel. it's the custom thing i was thinking of. in america we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. we throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
i understand.
we throw away the whole head.
i can't remember anything about last night. is there something i should remember?
no, you should forget about last night.
laura, i am your friend.
i know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
you're not mad at me?
no.
i feel so bad. i had nightmares all night long.  they all knew you at that place.
what can i tell you?
how did the car get back here?
we got it back, that's all.
how did i get in the house? how did i get into my bed?
i can't help you there.
was i wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
all my things have me in them. i don't want you to be like me.
but i love you, laura.
and i love you, too. but don't wear my stuff.
why do you do it, laura?
cause i like it.
when's the next business trip, big fella?
soon. how about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
i can arrange that. i like that.
what are you doing?
who am i?
i don't know.
that's right.
dad... dad... who was that? how do you know him? he looked familiar. have i met him?
no, you haven't met him. have you met him?
no.
we're late to get to your mother.
just sit here for a moment. you seem very upset.
guy just pulls up out of the blue... i mean... what is this world coming to?
what's wrong?
nothing, i chickened out.
are you sure you're okay?
yes.
dad?
yes.
did you come home during the day last week?
no.
oh, i thought i saw you.
you know, i did come home, come to think of it, on thursday. i had a severe headache and i was driving in the neighborhood so i just darted in and out of the house.  where were you, laura? i didn't see you?
i was down the street.
that's not important. i will tell you what is important. the fan will soon be starting.
who are you? who are you really?
i am the one who wants to breathe thru your nose and taste thru your mouth.
i'm nearly out.
it's taken care of, babe. you and i are going to make a big score tonight.  this will tide you over.
thank you, bobby. a big score?
maybe our biggest. i'll see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
don't be late.
i've got to see you.
not now.
this afternoon?
okay.  oh god, it's johnny horne's birthday today.
what about tonight?
i can't tonight.
what's going on?
i just can't, james. i can't do it.
johnny, johnny... let your daddy and your uncle and leland talk.  ben... leland, we can play the french against the norwegians. what do the french love more than anything?
boating?
no.
hiking?
no.
eating?
you'd think so.
sex?
you're getting warmer.
trees?
exactment. they are nuts about wood. they get goofy over trees.
history is on our side, ben. it's no accident that the great explorers were named hennepin, nicollet, marquette.
they were looking for wood.
hey, pete. can't believe your tank's dry up at the mill.
no... hell, no. just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "e" starin' at me.
you know what that big "e" stands for? big ed's gas farm.
yep. you're right. that's why i'm here.
what'll it be?
fill 'er up.
you got it.
i haven't got it yet.
nice night.
yep...  yes...  it is.
you missed somethin', ed.
i did? i didn't see anything.
yeah... look in here. look at it from this angle.
even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.
brother, i hear you talkin'.
here he comes.
here he comes.
this isn't mike.  is this mike?
bobby... ssshhhh... you killed mike.
no.
i want you to kill for me.
no. never. you'll have to kill me.
i want you to kill for me.
babe, i'm on my way out to the woods to divvy up the product. put this cash in your safety deposit box...  it's ten thousand dollars.
you killed mike.
laura, you didn't come and see me today.
i couldn't it was johnny horne's birthday. i promised i'd be with him. i told you not to call me here.
a little trouble with your parents is the least of your worries and something i am certainly willing to put up with.
i'm not.
did you make me a tape?
i already made you two tapes.
laura, you have to deal with all of this.
i'm dealing with it, doc. big time. maybe i'll make you a tape tomorrow. goodnight.
send me a kiss.
laura. what's wrong this morning?
stay away from me.
i hate asparagus.
sure you do, it's good for you.
where's dad?
ben asked him to stay late to plan for the norwegians.
if it's okay with you i'm going to bobby's to do my homework.
it's a school night... back by nine.
bad news, kid, it was baby laxative.
what was?
the stuff we got last night.
baby laxative? we can't snort baby laxative.
no shit...  we killed a guy for baby laxative.
what is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
don't get funny with me again.
i'm not... bobby i'm gonna need some more stuff. i mean it. i'm out.
yeah, and i'm gonna need that ten thousand dollars back.
sure, but i can't get it till after school tomorrow.
let's ditch this place and party.
not tonight. just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
why? why not? where are you goin'?
we can do it right here.
bobby...
bobby's got it.
thanks, bobby.  and my little round friends, too.
good night, mom.
good night, sweetheart.

that's right. there's no place left to go is there, james?
what do you mean?
you know it and i know it.
what is wrong with us?... we have everything.
everything, but everything.
oh, laura.
"oh, laura..."
you always hurt the ones you love.
you mean the ones you pity.
say anything you want... i know you love me and i love you.
i do love you.  let's get lost together.
shit, maybe he'll kill you.
what?
when he finds out.
what?
bobby killed a guy.
what are you talking about? bobby didn't kill anybody.
you want to see...
see what?
right. open your eyes, james. you don't know me. even donna doesn't know me. your laura disappeared... it's just me now.
right on time, baby.
buy me a ticket to the great went.
we're on our way, baby.
let's go all the way.
don't make me do it.
no, you have to kill me.
i always thought you knew it was me.
no! you can't have me.  kill me.
where is the ring?
someone else has it now.
that would indicate that it's the future.
the later events have never been kept a secret.
where am i? and how can i leave?
you are here and there is no place to go...
