son!
dad!  save yourself!
actually this is all just a bad dream.  you're home in bed. heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you've personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. tragic irony or poetic justice? you tell me.
my god ... it's true.  the penguin- man of the sewers ... please, don't h--
quiet, max.  what do you think, this is a conversation?
what, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
no, just give you a splitting headache.
well it's not working.
most of all, i want to find out who i am.  by finding my parents. learning my "human" name.  simple stuff that the good people of gotham take for granted.
and exactly <u>why</u> am <u>i</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
yawn.  that coulda come from anywhere.
what about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in gotham?
if there were such documents -- and that is not an admission -- i would have seen to it they were shredded.
a lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  by the way, how's fred adkins, your old partner?
fred.  fred?  he's ... actually he's been on an extended vacation, and --
you know what, mr. ... penguin-sir? i think perhaps i could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  and once we're both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
you won't regret this, mr. shreck.
mr. wayne ... something wrong?
no, nothing, ah ...  his parents ... i ... i hope he finds them.
it's cold.
it's vichyssoise, sir.
vichyssoise.  supposed to be cold, right?
i suppose you feel better now, sir.
no, actually i feel worse.
working late?  i'm touched.
no, i am.  yes, i'm boning up for your bruce wayne meeting in the morning.  i pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and mr. wayne's hoped-for investment... i've studied up on all of it ... i even opened the protected files and --
why, how industrious.  and how did you open protected files, may i ask?
well i figured that your password was "finster."  your pomeranian. and it was.  and it's all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, i mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it's gonna be one big giant...
big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  and that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from gotham city, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  which, unless i'm being dense, is a novel approach, i'd say.
and who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?
... where did curiosity get the cat?
i'm no cat.  i'm just an assistant. a <u>secretary</u> --
and a very, very good one.
too good?
it's our secret.  honest.  how can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
i must protect my interests, ms. kyle.  and interest number one, is <u>moi</u>.
okay, go ahead.  intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  i mean, it's not like you can just kill me.
actually, it's a lot like that.
i ... it was terrible, i leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
she jumped.  she'd been depressed.
yes.  <u>yes</u>.  boyfriend trouble ..?
pms.
hmm.  primitive ventilation.
damn those carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
no.  no glass on the inside.
weird, huh?
i'd offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
good time, too.  everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after new years'.
if my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
max, i'm gonna fight you on this. the mayor and i have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  so --
mayors come and go.  and heirs tire easily.  really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with muhammed shreck.
i'm not scared of you, max.
not compared to that "cobblepot" person you're promoting...
scared of oswald, are you?  why, if his parents hadn't eighty- sixed him you two might've been roomies, at prep school!
"oswald" is linked to the red triangle gang.  i can't prove it but we both know it's true.
wayne, i'll not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  if my assistant were here, she'd already have escorted you out, to --
selina?!  selina ... selina ...
that's my name, maximillions. don't wear it out, babe, or i'll make you buy me a new one.
uh, selina, this is, uh, bruce wayne.
we've met.
have we?
sorry.  i mistook me for somebody else.
you mean mistook <u>me</u>?
didn't i say that?
yes and no ...
what happened?
yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
you don't seem like the type who does business with mr. shreck.
no.  and you don't seem like the type who takes orders from him.
well that's a ... long story ...
well, i could ... free up some time...
i'm listed.
i'm tempted.
pouring myself into my work.
i, ah ... didn't catch your last name.
oh.  "kyle."
you buy this "blurry" business?
women... nothing surprises me, chip. excepting your late mother... who even knew selina had a brain to damage?  bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  meanwhile i got badder fish to fry.  yeah -- oswald, please.
don't look, oswald.  it's a surprise.
a big bag of fan mail?  filthy lucre?  wait don't tell me ... is it a broad?
bu ... wh ... i ... i mean ...
yes, adulation is a cross to bear. god knows <u>i</u> know.  but someone's got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress mayor and don't deny it, mr. cobblepot, you've got the magic!
max, elections happen in november. is this not late december, or have i inhaled too much swamp gas in my time?
wonder if it's worth my time.
we need signatures.  to overturn the ballot.  i can supply those, oswald.
i could teach her my "french flipper" trick...
oswald:  we need one more thing.
a platform?  lemme see ... stop global warming.  start global cooling.  make the world a colder place.  <u>frigid</u> ...
that's fine, oswald.  but to get the mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. like the reichstag fire, the gulf of tonkin.
"you're doin' great, mayor cobblepot."  "your table is ready, mayor cobblepot."  "i need you, oswald.  i need you now.  that's the biggest parasol i ever --"
precisely.  but they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that i've provided.  that shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
... want 'em to go apeshit.  nutso. ballistic ... do permanent damage to little old ladies.  loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  <u>sounds</u> fun.  but i ...
i got my own ... <u>quest</u> to pursue up here.  it's crucial i not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
sidetracked?  oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
imagine:  you'll have the ear of the media.  access to captains of industry.  unlimited poon- tang ...
admiring your handiwork?
touring the riot scene.  gravely assessing the devastation. upstanding mayor stuff.
you're not the mayor.
things change.  hey, good to meet you.  we'll be working hand in glove in gotham's glorious future.
once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. must feel pretty good.
better than you know, bat-boy.
what're you really after?
ah, the direct approach.  i admire that in a man with a mask.  but you don't really think you'll ever win, playing it your way ..?
things change.
where's the fire?
"shreck's."  you --
how could you?  i'm a woman...
i'm -- sorry, i --
as i was saying:  i'm a woman, and can't be taken for granted.  are you listening, you batman you?
hanging on every word.
good joke.  wanna hear another one?
a "he-man"?  sure.  they shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole i crawl out of.
wow, a real response and you're not even trying to get into my tights. but explain me ... if you're so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
i just can't sleep at night. exploding department stores keep me up.  one ...
i can't sleep either, lately.  a little link, between us.  but bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and i'm dying to disturb it.  that could put a strain on our relationship.
...four, five.
morning, max.  bummer about the store.  you insured?
i damn well better be.  in fact i want you to phone those goniffs over at gotham insurance and tell them --
actually i have to split.  take a "personal day."  you don't mind? max, you're tops.
i'll warm ya!  i got hot mitts --!
down, oswald.  we have to talk.  you see we've got something in common.
appetite for destruction? contempt for the czars of fashion? wait don't tell me ... naked sexual charisma?
batman.  the thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
huh?  you're implying i'm some kinda psycho criminal?
are you perchance a registered voter?  i'm also a mayoral prospect.
i have but one pet cause, today: ban the bat.
oh, him again.  he's already history -- check it out.
we're gonna disassemble his spiffy old batmobile, then reassemble it as an h-bomb on wheels.  capiche? yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
he'd have more power as a martyr. no, to destroy batman we must first turn him into what he hates most.  meaning, us.
y'mean frame him?
you're quick.  mayor cobblepot.
thanks.  jeez.  not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. generally the babes flock to me, i tell 'em take a number.
you're off the hook, ozzie.  but batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
he napalmed my arm.  he knocked me off a building just when i was starting to feel good about myself. i want to play an integral part in his degradation.
well, a plan <u>is</u> forming ... a vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
i want in.  the thought of busting batman makes me feel all ... dirty.  maybe i'll give myself a bath right here ...
selina.  hi.  didn't mean to --
scare me?  no, actually, i was just scaring myself ...
i don't see how ... anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from ebeneezer shreck.
treat to be here.
the news these days ... weird. people looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
and it's not even accurate ... i mean, "batman blows it"?  the guy probably prevented <u>millions</u> in property damage.
i heard on tv, "catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds."  how do these hacks <u>sleep</u> at night?
you're not coming to that, are you?  "the relighting of the tree" thing?
i wouldn't be caught dead.  no, it's probably how i would be caught.  the mayor stupidly took cobblepot's bait --
-- and it's gonna be a hot time in the cold town tonight.
you almost sound enthusiastic.
i detest violence, but ... christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
you've got a dark side, selina kyle.
no darker than yours, bruce.
well, i'm... braver at night, if that's what you mean...
yeah?  me too...
... maybe i'll watch it on tv.
"we"?  you and...
... and me.  no, that's be me and me.  is that what i said?
yes and no...
i'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, i'd suppose.
executive assistant.  secretary.  girlfriend?
had one.  didn't work.
what went wrong?  hang on, i think i know ... you kept things from her.
nope, i told her everything.
and the truth frightened her?
well ... how can i put this. there were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. because <u>i</u> had trouble reconciling them.  vicki said.
"vicki."  ice-skater, or stewardess?
photojournalist.
sure.
well?  was "vicki" right?  about your difficulty with duality?
if i said yes, then you might think me a norman bates, or a ted bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
it's the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  sickos never scare me.  at least they're commited.
ah ... then you've come to the right lonely mansion.
i, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
nor i, on the second.
what're you doing three dates from now?
sorry, alfred, i have to get to the plaza.  you heard penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
which is why i hoped you'd snub him.
'fraid i can't.  there's been a kidnapping ... tell selina ... ms. kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she'll feel sorry ... no, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that i ... not in a dumb "be my girlfriend way," but --
i will relay the message.
alright, thanks.
hey stud:  i thought we had something together.
we do.
a kiss under the misteltoe. mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
but a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
you're the second man who killed me this week.  but hey, no prob ... i've got seven lives left.
i tried to grab you -- save you --
seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead, or deeply resentful.
let's consummate our fiendish union!
i wouldn't touch you to scratch you.
i oughta have you spayed!  you sent out all the signals!
did i?  only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  corn dog!
me, domesticated?  by you?  i doubt it!  you repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.
the name is oswald cobblepot.
he didn't even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
point is, listen to them.  they've lost faith in old symbols. they're ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  if it works, don't fix it...
selina ... more facets than vicki, huh?  funny, but sort of mysterious...
"affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
i think i'll take the stairs.
max!  relax!  josh and jen'll put a spin on this.  we'll talk it over tonight, at your costume par--
i think you'd feel out of place at my party.  you see, it's for winners.
mr. wayne ... a reminder:  tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious mr. shreck.  may we rsvp in the resoundingly negative?
i'm tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... selina will probably be there ...
ah.  "who", may i ask, are you going "as"?
you'll never guess.
ingenious costume.  let me guess ... trust-fund goody-goody?
course you're feeling fine ... you almost made a monster the mayor of gotham city.
i am the light of this city.  <u>and</u> i am its mean, twisted soul.  does it really matter who's the "mayor"?
it does to me.
yawn.
sorry about yesterday ... some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
's'okay, i had to go home, feed my cat.
no hard feelings?
there's a big, comfy california king over in bedding.  what say we ...
y'mean take off our costumes?
guess i'm sick of wearing masks ...
same here.  so why'd you come tonight?
you first.
now don't give me a killing-max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  aren't you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  when he should be six feet under?
jesus, selina, you're not the judge <u>or</u> the jury... i mean, just who do you think you <u>are</u>?
i don't know anymore, bruce ...
a kiss under the mistletoe. mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
but a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
... what do we do?
i don't know.  till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
you're coming with me, you great white dope!  to die, way down in the sewer!
not chip!  please!  penguin ... if you have one iota of human feeling, you'll take me instead.
i don't.  so, no.
i'm the one you want!  penguin, please!  ask yourself:  isn't it max shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  isn't it max, not chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
okay, you have a point.  plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves.
ten, nine...
the christmas eve of destruction -- !
... eight, seven...
silent night, violent night...
all is shrill, all is blight...
well, um... funny thing, your penguins... they're not responding to the launch command.  fact they're kind of turned around now... like someone jammed our signal...
but who could've ... no, don't say it.
my lips are sealed.
i think you're jealous that i'm a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
maybe you're right.
i don't know what you want, but i know i can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
your blood, max.
my blood?  i ... i gave at the office.
a half-pint.  i'm talking gallons.
let's make a deal.  <u>other</u> than my blood, what can i off--
sorry, max.  a die for a die.
either you've caught a cold, or you're planning to kill me.
first you're gonna shut up.  then you're gonna turn yourself in.
don't be naive.  the law doesn't apply to people like him!  or us --
wrong on both counts.
selina!  selina kyle!?  you're fired!  and bruce -- bruce wayne! why are you dressed up as batman?
he <u>is</u> batman, you moron.
was.
you killed me, batman killed me, penguin killed me.  three lives down.  got enough bullets to finish me off?
one way to find out?
i guess this mean we won.
yes, i suppose that we did.
well ... come what may... merry christmas, mr. wayne.
right.  sure.  and "peace on earth, good will toward men."
