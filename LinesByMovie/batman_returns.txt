son!
dad!  save yourself!
actually this is all just a bad dream.  you are home in bed. heavily sedated, resting comfortably, and dying from the carcinogens you have personally spewed in a lifetime of profiteering. tragic irony or poetic justice? you tell me.
my god ... it is true.  the penguin- man of the sewers ... please, do not h--
quiet, max.  what do you think, this is a conversation?
what, is that supposed to "hypnotize" me?
no, just give you a splitting headache.
well it is not working.
most of all, i want to find out who i am.  by finding my parents. learning my "human" name.  simple stuff that the good people of gotham take for granted.
and exactly why am i gonna help you?
yawn.  that coulda come from anywhere.
what about the documents that prove you own half the firetraps in gotham?
if there were such documents -- and that is not an admission -- i would have seen to it they were shredded.
a lot of tape and a little patience make all the difference.  by the way, how is fred adkins, your old partner?
fred.  fred?  he is ... actually he is been on an extended vacation, and --
you know what, mr. ... penguin-sir? i think perhaps i could help orchestrate a little welcome-home scenario for you.  and once we are both back home, perhaps we can help each other out ...
you will not regret this, mr. shreck.
mr. wayne ... something wrong?
no, nothing, ah ...  his parents ... i ... i hope he finds them.
it is cold.
it is vichyssoise, sir.
vichyssoise.  supposed to be cold, right?
i suppose you feel better now, sir.
no, actually i feel worse.
working late?  I am touched.
no, i am.  yes, I am boning up for your bruce wayne meeting in the morning.  i pulled all the files on the proposed power plant, and mr. wayne's hoped-for investment... I have studied up on all of it ... i even opened the protected files and --
why, how industrious.  and how did you open protected files, may i ask?
well i figured that your password was "finster."  your pomeranian. and it was.  and it is all very interesting, though a bit on the technical side, i mean about how the power plant is a power plant in name only since in fact it is going to be one big giant...
big giant capacitor.  and that, instead of generating power it will sort of be --  -- sucking power, from gotham city, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  which, unless I am being dense, is a novel approach, I would say.
and who ... would you say this to?
... where did curiosity get the cat?
I am no cat.  I am just an assistant. a secretary --
and a very, very good one.
too good?
it is our secret.  honest.  how can you be so mean to someone so meaningless?
i must protect my interests, ms. kyle.  and interest number one, is moi.
okay, go ahead.  intimidate me, bully me if it makes you feel big.  i mean, it is not like you can just kill me.
actually, it is a lot like that.
i ... it was terrible, i leaned over, and accidentally knocked her, out --
she jumped.  she would been depressed.
yes.  yes.  boyfriend trouble ..?
pms.
hmm.  primitive ventilation.
damn those carny bolsheviks the other night, throwing bricks at my windows --
no.  no glass on the inside.
weird, huh?
I would offer you coffee, but my assistant is using her vacation time.
good time, too.  everyone but the bandits seem to be slacking off till after new years'.
if my life has had any meaning, that is the meaning.
max, I am going to fight you on this. the mayor and i have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  so --
mayors come and go.  and heirs tire easily.  really think a flyweight like you could last fifteen rounds with muhammed shreck.
I am not scared of you, max.
not compared to that "cobblepot" person you are promoting...
scared of oswald, are you?  why, if his parents had not eighty- sixed him you two might have been roomies, at prep school!
"oswald" is linked to the red triangle gang.  i can not prove it but we both know it is true.
wayne, I will not stand for mud- slinging in this office.  if my assistant were here, she would already have escorted you out, to --
selina?!  selina ... selina ...
that is my name, maximillions. do not wear it out, babe, or I will make you buy me a new one.
uh, selina, this is, uh, bruce wayne.
we have met.
have we?
sorry.  i mistook me for somebody else.
you mean mistook me?
did not i say that?
yes and no ...
what happened?
yes, did -- did you injure yourself on that ski slope?  is that why you cut short your vacation and came back?
you do not seem like the type who does business with mr. shreck.
no.  and you do not seem like the type who takes orders from him.
well that is a ... long story ...
well, i could ... free up some time...
I am listed.
I am tempted.
pouring myself into my work.
i, ah ... did not catch your last name.
oh.  "kyle."
you buy this "blurry" business?
women... nothing surprises me, chip. excepting your late mother... who even knew selina had a brain to damage?  bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  meanwhile i got badder fish to fry.  yeah -- oswald, please.
do not look, oswald.  it is a surprise.
a big bag of fan mail?  filthy lucre?  wait do not tell me ... is it a broad?
bu ... wh ... i ... i mean ...
yes, adulation is a cross to bear. god knows i know.  but someone is got to supplant our standing-in- the-way-of-progress mayor and do not deny it, mr. cobblepot, you have got the magic!
max, elections happen in november. is this not late december, or have i inhaled too much swamp gas in my time?
wonder if it is worth my time.
we need signatures.  to overturn the ballot.  i can supply those, oswald.
i could teach her my "french flipper" trick...
oswald:  we need one more thing.
a platform?  lemme see ... stop global warming.  start global cooling.  make the world a colder place.  frigid ...
that is fine, oswald.  but to get the mayor recalled, we still need a catalyst, a trigger, an incident. like the reichstag fire, the gulf of tonkin.
"you're doin' great, mayor cobblepot."  "your table is ready, mayor cobblepot."  "i need you, oswald.  i need you now.  that is the biggest parasol i ever --"
precisely.  but they must come and go via the plumbing ducts that I have provided.  that shall be as sacred as the separation between church and state.
... want 'em to go apeshit.  nutso. ballistic ... do permanent damage to little old ladies.  loot, pillage, annoy people in a big way ...  sounds fun.  but i ...
i got my own ... quest to pursue up here.  it is crucial i not get sidetracked, with some silly ...
sidetracked?  oswald, this is your chance to fulfill a destiny that your parents carelessly discarded ...
reclaim my birthright, y'mean?
imagine:  you will have the ear of the media.  access to captains of industry.  unlimited poon- tang ...
admiring your handiwork?
touring the riot scene.  gravely assessing the devastation. upstanding mayor stuff.
you are not the mayor.
things change.  hey, good to meet you.  we will be working hand in glove in gotham's glorious future.
once you were their freak, now these clowns do your bidding. must feel pretty good.
better than you know, bat-boy.
what are you really after?
ah, the direct approach.  i admire that in a man with a mask.  but you do not really think you will ever win, playing it your way ..?
things change.
where is the fire?
"shreck's."  you --
how could you?  I am a woman...
I am -- sorry, i --
as i was saying:  I am a woman, and can not be taken for granted.  are you listening, you batman you?
hanging on every word.
good joke.  wanna hear another one?
a "he-man"?  sure.  they shine that beacon in the sky, then wonder what hole i crawl out of.
wow, a real response and you are not even trying to get into my tights. but explain me ... if you are so down on "them" out there, why bust your bat-buns to protect 'em?
i just can not sleep at night. exploding department stores keep me up.  one ...
i can not sleep either, lately.  a little link, between us.  but bottom line baby, you live to preserve the peace, and I am dying to disturb it.  that could put a strain on our relationship.
...four, five.
morning, max.  bummer about the store.  you insured?
i damn well better be.  in fact i want you to phone those goniffs over at gotham insurance and tell them --
actually i have to split.  take a "personal day."  you do not mind? max, you are tops.
I will warm ya!  i got hot mitts --!
down, oswald.  we have to talk.  you see we have got something in common.
appetite for destruction? contempt for the czars of fashion? wait do not tell me ... naked sexual charisma?
batman.  the thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
huh?  you are implying I am some kinda psycho criminal?
are you perchance a registered voter?  I am also a mayoral prospect.
i have but one pet cause, today: ban the bat.
oh, him again.  he is already history -- check it out.
we are going to disassemble his spiffy old batmobile, then reassemble it as an h-bomb on wheels.  capiche? yesterday's victor is tomorrow's vapor.
he would have more power as a martyr. no, to destroy batman we must first turn him into what he hates most.  meaning, us.
y'mean frame him?
you are quick.  mayor cobblepot.
thanks.  jeez.  not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. generally the babes flock to me, i tell 'em take a number.
you are off the hook, ozzie.  but batman is decidedly not.
he napalmed my arm.  he knocked me off a building just when i was starting to feel good about myself. i want to play an integral part in his degradation.
well, a plan is forming ... a vicious one, involving the loss of innocent life ...
i want in.  the thought of busting batman makes me feel all ... dirty.  maybe I will give myself a bath right here ...
selina.  hi.  did not mean to --
scare me?  no, actually, i was just scaring myself ...
i do not see how ... anyway, it is a treat to find you out in the world, away from ebeneezer shreck.
treat to be here.
the news these days ... weird. people looking to superheroes for their peace of mind, and blaming their problems on super-villains ... instead of themselves, or their spouses at least.
and it is not even accurate ... i mean, "batman blows it"?  the guy probably prevented millions in property damage.
i heard on tv, "catwoman is thought to weigh 140 pounds."  how do these hacks sleep at night?
you are not coming to that, are you?  "the relighting of the tree" thing?
i would not be caught dead.  no, it is probably how i would be caught.  the mayor stupidly took cobblepot's bait --
-- and it is going to be a hot time in the cold town tonight.
you almost sound enthusiastic.
i detest violence, but ... christmas complacency can be a downer, too.
you have got a dark side, selina kyle.
no darker than yours, bruce.
well, i'm... braver at night, if that is what you mean...
yeah?  me too...
... maybe I will watch it on tv.
"we"?  you and...
... and me.  no, that is be me and me.  is that what i said?
yes and no...
I am sure he is wonderful company and all, but ... does not the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I would suppose.
executive assistant.  secretary.  girlfriend?
had one.  did not work.
what went wrong?  hang on, i think i know ... you kept things from her.
nope, i told her everything.
and the truth frightened her?
well ... how can i put this. there were two truths ... and she had trouble reconciling them. because i had trouble reconciling them.  vicki said.
"vicki."  ice-skater, or stewardess?
photojournalist.
sure.
well?  was "vicki" right?  about your difficulty with duality?
if i said yes, then you might think me a norman bates, or a ted bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
it is the so-called "normal" guys who always let you down.  sickos never scare me.  at least they are commited.
ah ... then you have come to the right lonely mansion.
i, ah ... never fool around on the first date.
nor i, on the second.
what are you doing three dates from now?
sorry, alfred, i have to get to the plaza.  you heard penguin, he was practically begging me to show.
which is why i hoped you would snub him.
'fraid i can't.  there is been a kidnapping ... tell selina ... ms. kyle ... that some business came up -- no, tell her some major deal fell through, she will feel sorry ... no, no, here's what to do, just tell her ... let her know that i ... not in a dumb "be my girlfriend way," but --
i will relay the message.
alright, thanks.
hey stud:  i thought we had something together.
we do.
a kiss under the misteltoe. mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
but a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean it.
you are the second man who killed me this week.  but hey, no prob ... I have got seven lives left.
i tried to grab you -- save you --
seems like every woman you try to save ends up dead, or deeply resentful.
let's consummate our fiendish union!
i would not touch you to scratch you.
i oughta have you spayed!  you sent out all the signals!
did i?  only 'cause my mom trained me to, with a man... any man, all men --  corn dog!
me, domesticated?  by you?  i doubt it!  you repulsive... awful... penguin.
the name is oswald cobblepot.
he did not even lose a limb, an eyeball ... bladder control ..
point is, listen to them.  they have lost faith in old symbols. they are ready to bond with you, the icon of the future.  if it works, do not fix it...
selina ... more facets than vicki, huh?  funny, but sort of mysterious...
"affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
i think I will take the stairs.
max!  relax!  josh and jen'll put a spin on this.  we will talk it over tonight, at your costume par--
i think you would feel out of place at my party.  you see, it is for winners.
mr. wayne ... a reminder:  tonight is that loathsome party, hosted by that odious mr. shreck.  may we rsvp in the resoundingly negative?
I am tempted, but ... well ... it is an occasion for celebration, and ... umm ... selina will probably be there ...
ah.  "who", may i ask, are you going "as"?
you will never guess.
ingenious costume.  let me guess ... trust-fund goody-goody?
course you are feeling fine ... you almost made a monster the mayor of gotham city.
i am the light of this city.  and i am its mean, twisted soul.  does it really matter who is the "mayor"?
it does to me.
yawn.
sorry about yesterday ... some big deal came together, no, fell through, and --
's'okay, i had to go home, feed my cat.
no hard feelings?
there is a big, comfy california king over in bedding.  what say we ...
y'mean take off our costumes?
guess I am sick of wearing masks ...
same here.  so why did you come tonight?
you first.
now do not give me a killing-max- won't-solve-anything speech, because it will.  are not you tired of this sanctimonious robber baron always coming out on top?  when he should be six feet under?
jesus, selina, you are not the judge or the jury... i mean, just who do you think you are?
i do not know anymore, bruce ...
a kiss under the mistletoe. mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
but a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
... what do we do?
i do not know.  till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
you are coming with me, you great white dope!  to die, way down in the sewer!
not chip!  please!  penguin ... if you have one iota of human feeling, you will take me instead.
i don't.  so, no.
I am the one you want!  penguin, please!  ask yourself:  is not it max shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  is not it max, not chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
okay, you have a point.  plus, the hysterics are getting on my nerves.
ten, nine...
the christmas eve of destruction -- !
... eight, seven...
silent night, violent night...
all is shrill, all is blight...
well, um... funny thing, your penguins... they are not responding to the launch command.  fact they are kind of turned around now... like someone jammed our signal...
but who could have ... no, do not say it.
my lips are sealed.
i think you are jealous that I am a genuine freak, and you have to wear a mask!
maybe you are right.
i do not know what you want, but i know i can get it for you with a minimum of fuss.  money, jewels, a very big ball of string...
your blood, max.
my blood?  i ... i gave at the office.
a half-pint.  I am talking gallons.
let's make a deal.  other than my blood, what can i off--
sorry, max.  a die for a die.
either you have caught a cold, or you are planning to kill me.
first you are going to shut up.  then you are going to turn yourself in.
do not be naive.  the law does not apply to people like him!  or us --
wrong on both counts.
selina!  selina kyle!?  you are fired!  and bruce -- bruce wayne! why are you dressed up as batman?
he is batman, you moron.
was.
you killed me, batman killed me, penguin killed me.  three lives down.  got enough bullets to finish me off?
one way to find out?
i guess this mean we won.
yes, i suppose that we did.
well ... come what may... merry christmas, mr. wayne.
right.  sure.  and "peace on earth, good will toward men."
