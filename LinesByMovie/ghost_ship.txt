what is slow?
maybe twenty gallons an hour.
where from?
amidships starboard at the beam. just under the waterline. i do not think it is a problem.
hear that, dodge? epps do not think it is a problem.
I will sleep good tonight knowing that.
greer to murphy.
go.
the number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. epps says it is a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. they must have pumped it before we left sitka.
of course they did.
let the buyer beware.
what do you say, dodge?
i thought you say tuesday.
better late than never.
what is this?
you got a leak in the number nine compartment.
no, no. you got leak.
you pump it out and re-seam the hull, she will be good as new.
that cost me twenty grand at least.
fifteen, at the most.
twenty. you knock off twenty and then we see. after my guy looks at it.
you are kidding, right?
you want fair pay, make hamburger for mickey d. otherwise, please to sign.
not bad for dragging a leaky tub half way to russia.
he will sell the scrap for three times what he paid.
i must be in the wrong business.
you got that right.
better than "making hamburger for mickey d."
looks like epps' going to get some tonight.
with that coxswain dickhead.
you are not jealous, are you dodge?
are you kidding me? jealous? epps? gimme a break.
what seems to be the trouble, ladies?
whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
as i said, what seems to be the trouble?
did not you hear me, grandpa? or you got your hearing aid turned down?
i heard you. but I am choosing to ignore you. epps, let's go.
these ladies was having themselves a discussion and you are interrupting it.
you got about two seconds to get your paws off me, tarzan.
or what?
morning everybody.
show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you epps?
showed him a hell of a lot more than that.
i bet you did.
candy?
it is my pen name.
red sky at night, sailor's delight.
red sky in morning, sailor take warning.
one more?
why not.
what is your first name?
what?
it just occurred to me i do not know your first name. all this time and i do not know it.
maureen.
what?
maureen.
maureen?
roger.
roger?
yeah.
you think that is funny
no.
yeah.
there is a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
i been watching it for close to an hour and it has not moved. i can not raise it on the radio either. makes me think it might be in trouble.
alright. I will be right up.
too deep to anchor out there.
looks like it is adrift.
could be a fishing boat.
too big. more like a freighter.
what the hell would a freighter be doing up here? it is way out of the lanes. there is not a port for 800 miles.
smugglers maybe.
call the coastguard?
steer to one eight five. let's check her out.
it is funny.
how is that?
besides a little rust, everything's pretty well-preserved.
murphy, goddamit.
sorry.
probably slipped her moorings, got tangled up in a current.
out here? what, so a seven hundred foot passenger liner drifted out of spokane harbor and nobody managed to bump into her until now?
somebody is probably looking for her as we speak.
whatever the reason, she is adrift and abandoned. we have got every right to salvage her.
you mean tow her back? that is a thirty thousand ton ship you are talking about.
we have done it before.
yeah, from one side of the harbor to the other. but we got half the bering sea and the whole alaskan gulf to drag her over.
you have any idea how much a ship like that could be worth in salvage? the fittings alone could go for a few million.
if you get it back in one piece.
it is a risk I am willing to take.
all we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
so we cut her loose and wait it out. a little weather could not be anything she has not seen before.
it is a bloody navigation hazard. one boat can not control a ship that size.
the damn thing's been floating around for god knows how long and it has not hit anything yet. so we take it easy. a little of the old push pull.
go on.
salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. at least. who knows, could be more. could be a lot more.  what I am proposing is... we split it four ways.
arctic warrior, arctic warrior, arctic warrior. this is united states coastguard station north island. over.
north island, i wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the international maritime convention.
affirmative, arctic warrior. what type of vessel?
a passenger liner. over.
say again. over.
a passenger liner, north island. over.
what is the vessel name, registry, and present position? over.
passenger vessel "chimera." i will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. no registry information is available at this time. i have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at...  two zero one four hours zulu time. over.
affirmative, arctic warrior. please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. over.
roger, north island. arctic warrior over and out.
seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it am not going to be what you would call easy.  any questions?
supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
then we will all be doomed. any other questions?
ready?
bring it on, dude.
with a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make sitka in five days without another stop.
sounds reasonable.
hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to sitka and find out somebody wants it back?
they shoulda thought of that when they let her float away.
i do not care what, am not nobody just going to let us walk away with a ship that size.
the law's on our side. if they want to challenge it, let them try.
they must have scuttled it. nobody just lets a ship float away.
nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either.
ever heard of insurance, big boy?
mother fucker!
what is it?
threw a turbine blade.
the number one turbine's pretty well trashed. number two runs, but it is way underpowered.
how long to fix?
hard to say. i gotta get in there and have a look. at least a couple days. depending.
you think the extra strain caused it?
nah. everything was cool. it is just one of those things.
some classy tub in it is day, huh?
yeah.
looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
he would let you off at the nearest port, that is for sure.
how about now?
sixty pounds.
what? you sure?
that is what it says.
lemme see.
coffee?
yeah. thanks.
what did you find up there?
some charts. a crew manifest.  looks like her last voyage was january 1953. the question is where the hell's she been since.
she was sailing up north, right?
her destination was halifax, yeah.
well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  got stuck in the ice. the passengers and crew evacuated. she froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. they write it off. fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. the ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her.
ever heard of the mary celeste?
nope.
she was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of new york in 1872.  one day she was sighted off the coast of portugal by a merchant vessel, the dei gratia. as the crew of the dei gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the mary celeste. on boarding, they found her completely deserted. the captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. the last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. the table was even set for dinner. and in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
so what did happen?
nobody knows. there've been a lot of theories, of course. but we will never really know for sure.
you think she is sailing without a crew?
i think we would be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.
you are more practical than superstitious.
only way to be.
what is this?
turbine rotor's shot.
i thought you said it was just a blade.
metal's crystallized. got to replace the whole deal.
how much longer's that going to take?
like i always say --
i know i know, two ways to do anything --
the right way and the wrong way.
but how long?
hard to say.
we got to get outa here, dodge. a storm blows up and we are history.
I am telling you, you do not want to be running that fan like it is.
what about running number two by itself?
it is a full 2500 horses down. we could not drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
how long, then?
i gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
how long?
three, four days.
goddamit, dodge.
what do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? can not do it, skipper.
north island, please repeat? over.
arctic warrior, passenger vessel chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  over.
north island, have you got any additional information? over.
affirmative, arctic warrior. the vessel chimera was registered to the dobbins kirk line, halifax.  nova scotia. date of commission day nine month seven year one nine three two. over.
roger, north island. i am tied to the passenger vessel chimera. and she is afloat. repeat, she is afloat. over.
roger, arctic warrior. i say again, our records indicate the passenger vessel chimera was lost at sea. over.
roger, north island. please advise pending further information. over.
affirmative, arctic warrior. this is united states coast guard north island station. over and out.
obviously it is some kind of screw up. the shipping records are not a hundred percent accurate.
man, it gives me the creeps. we got no business towing a ship that size anyway. i say we fix the turbines and hit the highway.
are you crazy? do you realize we got ourselves a ship? we own a ship, dodge.
yeah, a ship that is supposed to have been lost at sea fifty years ago. you do not think that is just a little freaky?
if this thing turns out to be a ship everybody thought sank a long time ago, we just hit the jackpot.
yeah, well how the hell you get something like that wrong? that is a damn big boat. it is either sunk or it ain't.
fucker!
take it easy, dodge. it is only a piece of metal.
damn mind of it is own.
morning, skipper.
morning.
you are up late.
guess i must have fallen back to sleep. where is epps?
went aboard.
she take a radio?
how much you figure that is worth, skipper?
hard to say. maybe forty, fifty million.
ho, baby!
it is a hell of a lot of money.
what, you think there is something funny about it?
a ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift? and nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it?
if they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.
not for fifty million. an ocean liner maybe. but fifty million in gold, they come looking for.
maybe they did not want it back. maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
maybe. but there is always somebody whose interest's at stake.
did not happen yesterday, I will tell you that. torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.
then it happened before they scuttled her.
you mean, before she sank.
cargo like this could make a crew think twice.
then why did not they take it.
probably did not have time.
or somebody stopped them.
either way, they must have had a pretty good reason.
so what are we going to do. that is the big question, right?
a salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. it is ours.
then we are rich. we are damn, filthy stinking rich.
it looks like it.
so what? we gonna unload the gold and get a move on?
we leave it where it is. stick to the plan.
you gotta be kidding? what the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?
so we get a little more for the boat. besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.
yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to sitka.
it is worth the effort. believe me. besides we are going to need her to prove the salvage.
why not call for help?
for now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.
last thing we want is extra partners.
or uninvited guests.
i heard that.
dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.
yeah, yeah. I am on it.
the sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what is ours.
two hundred twenty two kilograms of solid gold.
that is what i call a payday.
hell yeah.
one minute I am minding my own business, the next thing i know the whole place is burning up.  an oxygen tank must have blown on the welder. started an oil fire.
looks like it took out the backup genny too.
this is going to hurt a little.
thanks for the warning -- ow! damn!
what now?
we could call for help.
and get a bunch of fools sniffin' around here?
what other choices have we got?
i tell you one thing, we are not going to be towing no ship now.
arctic warrior, arctic warrior, arctic warrior. this is united states coastguard station north island. your radio check is affirmative. over.
roger that, north island. arctic warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. over and out.
fifty million four ways. that is twelve million and change a piece.  what you going to do with your share, skipper?
not much at all, i guess. retire. live out my golden years and all that.
I am buyin' me a nice outrigger. spend my time hauling rich seattle business men through the puget.
how about you epps?
guess I will just keep working.
what are you crazy?
i like my job.
greer?
moving to sweden.
what is so great about sweden?
it is a beautiful country. very clean. very civilized. and cold.
that is a good thing?
hell, yeah. i like it cold. colder the better.
yeah, but not as cold as those swedish girls you only gonna dream about.
we will see who is dreamin', m'man.
dreamin's all any of you are going to be doing if we do not get this boat running.
yeah, yeah.
sounds like the hull.
warm water current maybe, making the metal expand.
take it easy, you will live longer.
did you see him?
who?
the guy. he just came this way.
what guy?
there is somebody else on this boat.
what? what the hell're you talking about.
i saw him. just a minute ago. some guy.
are you sure?
of course I am sure. i saw him.
you sure it was not me?
it was not you. it was somebody else. there is somebody else aboard.
light in those passages am not so good.
I am telling you, i saw somebody. i do not know who it was. but i saw somebody.
what did he look like?
maybe six feet. lanky. i did not get a good look. he was far away. but i saw him. i saw him as sure as you are standing there.
where is his boat, then? where is his crew? he am not going to be out here by himself, that is for damn sure.
she is so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we would never know it.
maybe that is his boat.
gimme a break.
if somebody is aboard her already, she am not ours. she is theirs.
bullshit. that boat has not made steam for fifty years. we found her. she is ours.
not in the eyes of the law.
so, we find this guy and make a deal with him.
we do not exactly have the best bargaining position.
i say fuck the motherfucker. we are a professional salvage crew going about our business. what is some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway?
and what do you propose? that we knock this guy off?
why not? why the fuck not?
fifty million dollars. fifty million. we gonna let this guy just take it from us? one guy?
so we kill him?
I am saying we got to do whatever we got to do to preserve our interest.
i do not know.
let's just take it easy here, alright? nobody's going to kill anybody.
supposing he wants to get bad with us?
one guy is not going to be so stupid.
maybe he is not alone.
i say we off-load some of that gold now.
would you hold on just a minute here, please? look, there is no reason to panic now. epps saw somebody. fine. it is a big boat.  chances're real good he does not even know about the gold. if we stay cool, nobody'll be the wiser.  the gold stays where it is til we are ready to go. like i said, it will be a hell of a lot safer there than here.
what if that fucker finds it before we are ready to go?
we will stand a watch. four on, eight off. low man first.
guess that would be me. again.
dodge, get on that turbine. i do not care if you do not sleep for a week. the sooner you are done, the sooner we can get out of here. how is the food situation?
pretty low all around.
we will have to take it easy then. i do not think we will find much aboard the ship, but it is probably worth looking around.
if he is reasonable, maybe we can make some kind of deal. if not. we will have to re-consider our options.
yeah, reconsider fucking his shit up.
pretty handy with that scatter gun, epps. you raised on a farm?
seen a lota movies.
no cowboy shit up there, understand?
no cowboy shit. right.
coffee.
you are a pal.
got your light?
yup.
smokes?
oh yeah.
murphy to epps.
epps.
you just shoot at something?
yeah. just a bird. just a stupid bird.
ho-ly shit.
could not have happened much more than a month ago.
bodies're too fresh.
fresh am not the first word that comes to mind.
greek citizen. merchant navy.  obviously we are not the first to come across this ship. they probably stumbled across it just like we did.
and look what happened.
damn barbaric is what it is.
could be meant as a warning.
stay away. or else.
because of the gold.
that would be my guess.
so whoever did this might still be around.
maybe epps's mystery man had something to do with it.
maybe.
let's not be too hasty.
yeah. hell, what difference does it make if we report it now or later? we call this in now, gonna be coastguard, fbi, who knows who, all over the place.
can not you use something else?
i might be able to find something on the ship. but it is going to take time.
do what you need to do. just do it fast.
right.
i need lag bolts, especially one inch standard. and sheet metal. preferably steel, about a sixteenth of an inch. aluminium, even tin'll do.
i am not no mechanic, just so you know.
you find anything that even looks like a compressor. i do not care what, grab it.
dodge to murphy.
murphy.
you better get down here quick, skipper. I am on "c" deck. cabin 400.
what is it?
i think you better see this for yourself.
I am no doctor. but I would say he is in a coma.
a what?
i do not know what else you would call it. he is breathing on his own, but his pupils are completely blown out. he is totally unresponsive to pain.  what happened up there?
i heard a scream. when i got there i found him on the floor. he was having some kind of seizure. i did not see anybody else.
other than the obvious, there is nothing wrong with him that i can see, not on the outside.
then what the hell happened to him?
just before i heard him yell there was somebody on the radio.
greer?
i do not know. no. not greer. somebody.
it was a man's voice. repeating some sort of children's rhyme. i do not know, it did not make any sense. you did not hear it?
not me.
he needs a doctor.
I will call us in. dodge, see how many signal flares you can scrounge up.  keep an eye on him.
how is he doing?
same. any luck?
no. I will try again later.
they are dead in the water that morning. four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. and that evening they issue a general sos.
possibly false. hence the ima record of being lost at sea. i do not think mutiny's out of the question here.
on a passenger ship in 1953?
if they knew what they were carrying.
you are saying they mutinied for the gold?
if they were close enough to shore, they probably figured they could get away in the lifeboats.
only something must have gone wrong.
so. i got a question. just from a, you know, purely technical standpoint. we call the coastguard.  coastguard shows up. what exactly is the plan?
how do you mean?
well, they are going to be asking a lot of questions. about us. about those bodies. about the gold. seems like we oughta be prepared is all.
i guess the best strategy's just to tell them the truth.
yeah, well. the truth is one thing. when there is more than a few hundred million dollars involved, that is a whole new deal.
what do you propose?
for starters, getting that gold off the ship. what they do not know about is not going to bother them.
there is no way we are going to hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the coastguard here. besides, it will be safer where it is.
with all due respect, skipper.  part of that up there is mine. I would kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
just what the hell do you think you are doing?!
i do not know what you are talking about?
i think you know.
maybe you can tell me then.
the radio!
the radio. oh, yeah, the radio.
take it easy, willya? what about the radio?!
you smashed it!
what?!
do not lie to me!
what the fuck -- ?
you did not want us calling anybody. too liable to ruin your big payday.
i did not touch the fucking radio.
i did not touch the fucking radio!  ever occur to you there is somebody else on that boat, skipper?
conveniently enough for you.
look, i did not touch it. alright?
never been more thirsty in my life.
drink up then.
how're you feeling?
lost my sea legs.
any dizziness?
no.
headache, nausea, lights?
lights?
sudden flashes of light.
i feel fine.
what day is it?
i do not know. tuesday?
wrong. it is friday.
try wednesday.
right. wednesday.
what happened?
you do not remember?
last thing i remember i was aboard the chimera. down somewhere in there scavenging around.
you have been out for about a day.
say what?
dodge found you out cold in one of the cabins.
oh, man.
we heard you scream. any idea what you might have seen?
i wish i could tell you. I would be real interested to know myself.
the ah... the radio's out.
what?
somebody took it out of commission last night.
smashed it up pretty bad.
but, who -- ?
did you?
hell no. you think I am crazy?
"the crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill."
february first.
the same day she supposedly went down.
must not've been the captain's entry. he was probably out of the picture by then.
"their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. distress calls have been made."
collision? with what?
the page's missing. then their sos was real.
but where is the damage?
maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
if it was a ship she hit.
yeah.
you better get down here right now! we are taking water! big time!
what the hell happened!
turbine chamber on number two must have blown! took out part of the hull!
we are not going to be able to pump it!
alright. everybody grab your gear! this' is where we get off!
we am not exactly in what you would call your high traffic neighborhood either.
the coast guard has our last position. they will send somebody out soon enough. a ship this size you can not exactly miss.
it is a good bet they will be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
let 'em ask. this ship's legally ours now.
when they find out what it is carrying, they may not be so interested in what is legal.
maybe you shoulda thought a that before you scuttled our boat.
the turbine blew.
lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
gettin' a little hot under the collar, I would say.
shut up.
must be a little too the truth, eh dodge?
that oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants.
if money can buy what he wants.
i do not figure there is much i want money can not buy.
then you are a lucky man.
we will stand the watch on deck tonight. you are up first.
right.
you would think on a ship this size there would be something left to eat.
after fifty years there am not nothin' left but shoe leather.
tomorrow we will see if we can not find some line and tackle. use some of those bodies below decks for bait.
there is a charming thought.
what say, epps? you up for some roasted albatross?
why not?
it is a noaa buoy.
a what?
government weather. it is got a transmitter aboard.
we are still drifting.
the mooring has not come taught.
it is not going to hold us.
does not matter.
hey.
hey.
could not sleep.
wish i could say the same.
what do you think happened on this boat?
i guess that is the sixty four thousand dollar question, is not it?
the what?
never mind. before your time.  i think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. the usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. what happened after that is anybody's guess. but, judging by our greek friends down below, it does not look like the last time.
are we smart enough to avoid that?
i do not know, are we?
when you found me yesterday, at the pool. I would seen... something.  someone.
not our mystery guest again.
no. someone else. a girl.  I am not sure she was... real.
what, like some kind of ghost?
i do not know what else you would call her. one second she was there, the next she was gone.
maybe hallucination is the wrong word. it was more than that. as though they were showing me.
showing you what?
what happened.
maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those greeks.
no. i think they are, were, just passengers. innocent victims.
victims of what?
something bad happened here, murphy.
that much i think we have already established.
more than just a mutiny. more than just the gold.
she said the ship was evil. that we had to leave right away. that if we didn't, we might never leave.
what is that supposed to mean?
i do not know.
why you? how come the rest of us have not seen these people?
just lucky i guess.
dodge.  dodge.
what?
get up.
yeah, yeah.
you are late.
sorry.
do not fall asleep.
right.
i do not even want to know what that is going to taste like now.
better than starving to death.
murphy to epps.
epps, over.
either of you seen dodge?
nope.
he is not on deck and i can not raise him on the radio.
he took the shotgun and a light.
must have heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
epps? you there?
right here.
you okay?
yeah. fine. i just thought i heard something is all.
what?
nothing. let's get outa here.
can not find the shotgun.
so whoever did this now has our shotgun.
does not look like it much matters.
what do we do with him?
leave him till we can get some help.  from now on, nobody comes down here.
what about the gold?
leave it.
now hold up just a minute. let's be reasonable here.
you think whoever did this is reasonable?
all I am saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was.
i can not believe you. dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
i did not sign up to go home empty handed. and i sure am not going to roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. anybody tries to board, we will know about it.  you can do what you want, greer. but neither of us is going to risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
fine with me.
what do you think?
could be a stroke. who knows?  the general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "like wild dogs."
over the gold.
maybe it was more than that.
they went crazy.
crazy with greed. not crazy. not like him.
hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water.
if the weather holds it might not be so bad.
it is not the weather I am worried about. the wrong current could drag us as far as the aleutians before we come across another boat.
what happened?
we hit land.
what?
we are in an island chain. it is only a matter of time before we hit another one.
greer's gone. he broke out of the tank.
you killed them.
it was only a matter of time before somebody killed somebody.  you saw it coming as well as i did. dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. and greer too, except he went nuts. could not take it, i guess. could have happened in the middle of downtown anchorage. but did it make him any less dangerous? i do not think so.
so you killed them?
the way i figure it, it was them or me. i thought putting dodge up on that pipe was a nice touch? bought a little time. made it look like whoever killed those greeks was still around. but it is just us on this ship. us and your... spirit friends.
and now you are going to kill me, is that it?
i did not want it to turn out this way.
murphy, do not you see what is happening?
i think i see it pretty well.
it is the ship. the ship's making you think this way.
i know a little bit about human nature and what I have seen only confirms that.
it is a trap. there was no way we were going to get away with that gold. nobody ever does. it is just the bait. this ship sucks people in and it never lets them out.
i think maybe you been on this boat a little too long, with all that supernatural mumbo jumbo. there is nothing supernatural about greed. and that is what it comes down to, pure and simple.
i do not give a damn about the gold.
i wish i could believe that. either way, you know what I have done. I have got no choice.
