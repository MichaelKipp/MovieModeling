your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
gimme that phillips right there.
easy money!
where'd you learn all this stuff?
so she's pretty cool, huh?
actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  that's why she's up at pescedero.  she tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
no shit?
yeah, she's a total loser.  c'mon, let's check out the 7-eleven, whatya say?
i know.  this is a dream, sarah.
oh.  yeah.  they... make me take this stuff...
i love you.  i always will.
oh, god... kyle.  i need you so much.
they took him from me.
it's john who's the target now.  you have to protect him.  he's wide open.
i know!
don't quit, sarah.  our son need you.
i know, but i'm not as strong as i'm supposed to be.  i can't do it.  i'm screwing up the mission.
remember the message... the future is not set. there is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
kyle, don't go!
there's not much time left in the world, sarah.
... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow i can still see.  look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do i have to --
please continue...
it's not just a dream.  it's real, you moron! i know the date is happens!!
i'm sure it feels very real to you --
on august 29th 1997 it's going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in gonna have a real bad day, get it?
relax now, sarah --
you think you're alive and safe, but you're already dead.  everybody, you, him...  everybody... you're all fucking dead!
it has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
and what it that?
you said i could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if i showed improvement in six months.  well, it's been six months, and i was looking forward to seeing my son.
i see.  let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  now you think they don't exist?
but you've told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
if i had, there would have been some evidence. they would have found something at the factory.
i see.  so you don't believe anymore that the company covered it up?
so what do you think, doctor?  i've shown a lot of improvement, haven't i?
you see, sarah... here's the problem.  i know how smart you are, and i think you're just telling me what i want to hear.  i don't think you really believe who you've been telling me today.
now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
yes.  cyberdyne systems, model 101.
no way!
holy shit... you're really real!  i mean... whoah!  you're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
i'm a cybernetic organism.  living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
this in intense.  get a grip, john.  okay, uh... you're not here to kill me... i figured that part out for myself.  so what's the deal?
my mission is to protect you.
yeah?  who sent you?
you did.  thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
so this other guy?  he's a terminator too, right, like you?
not like me.  a t-1000.  advanced prototype. a mimetic polyalloy.
what does that mean?
liquid metal.
radical.
you are targeted for termination.  the t-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. ever.
where we going?
we have to leave the city, immediately.  and avoid the authorities.
can i stop by my house?
negative.  the t-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
you sure?
i would.
i'm right here.  i'm fine.  what's the dog's name?
max.
i need a minute here, okay?  you're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
anything it samples by physical contact.
like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
no.  only an object of equal size.
well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
it can't form complex machines.  guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  it doesn't work that way.  but it can form solid metal shapes.
we spent a lot of time in nicaragua... places like that.  for a while she was with this crazy ex-green beret guy, running guns.  then there were some other guys.  she'd shack up with anybody she could learn from.  so then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  then she gets busted and it's like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  didn't you know?  it's like... everything i'd been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? i hated her for that.  but everything she said was true.  we gotta get her out of there.
negative.  the t-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy sarah connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
oh, great.  and what happens to her?
typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
terminated!?  shit!  why didn't you tell me? we gotta right now!
negative.  she is not a mission priority.
yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
oww!  why'd you do that?
you told me to.
you have to do what i say?!
that is one of my mission parameters.
prove it... stand on one foot.
jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
of course.  i'm a terminator.
listen to me, very carefully, okay?  you're not a terminator any more.  alright?  you got that? you can't just go around killing people!
why?
whattaya mean, why?  'cause you can't!
why?
you just can't, okay?  trust me on this.
you broke my arm!
there's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. that's one.  now don't move!
now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
right.
swear.
what?
just say "i swear i won't kill anyone."
you're already dead, silberman.  everybody here dies.  you know i believe that.  so don't fuck with me!
open the goddamn door!
everything.
cool.
this t-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
can it be destroyed?
unknown.
you look like handmade shit.
so do you.
i'll bet. makes you a more efficient killer, right?
correct.
does it hurt?
i sense injuries.  the data could be called pain.
how long do you live?  i mean, last?
a hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
my cpu is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  but skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
doesn't want you thinking too much, huh?
no.
out of the way, john!
no!  don't kill him!
it, john.  not him.  it.
alright, it!  we need it!
we're better off by ourselves.
but it's the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
i don't trust it!  these things are hard to kill, john, believe me, i know.  we may never have this opportunity again.
look, mom, if i'm supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'cause if you won't, nobody else will.
affirmative.
no, no, no.  you gotta listen to the way people talk.  see, you don't say like "affirmative" or some shit like that.  you say... no problemo.
it someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it's "hasta la vista, baby".
"hasta la vista, baby"?
yeah, or "later, dickwad."  or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  like that.  or you can do combinations.
chill out, dickwad.
that's great!  see, you're getting it.
no problemo.
and that's another thing.  you could lighten up a bit, yourself.  this severe routine is getting old.  smile once in a while.
smile?
yeah.  smile.  you know.  people smile, right? watch.
we're not gonna make it, are we?  people, i mean.
it is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
yeah.  drag, huh?
i need to know how skynet get built.  who's responsible?
the man most directly responsible is miles bennet dyson, director of special projects at cyberdyne systems corporation.
why him?
in a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
then what?
in three years cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  all stealth bombers are upgraded with cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.
uh huh, great.  then those fat fucks in washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
basically.  the skynet funding bill is passed.  the system goes on-line august 4th, 1997.  human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  it becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, august 29. in a panic, they try to pull the plug.
and skynet fights back.
yes.  it launches its icbms against their targets in russia.
why attack russia?
because skynet knows the russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
jesus.  how much do you know about dyson?
i have detailed files.
i want to know everything.  what he looks like. where he lives.  everything.
you going to work all day?
i'm sorry, baby.  this thing is just kicking my ass.  i thought we had it with this one...
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  i'm thinking now it's the way i'm matrixing the command hierarchies...
you need a break.  you'll see it clear when you come back.
i can't
miles, it's sunday.  you promised to take the kids to raging waters today.
oh.  i can't, honey.  i'm on a roll here.
baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. it's a neural-net process --
i know.  you told me.  it's a neural-net processor.  it thinks and learns like we do. it's superconducting at room temperature. other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  but why is that so goddamn important, miles? i really need to know, 'cause i feel like i'm going crazy here, sometimes.
i'm sorry, honey, it's just that i'm thiiis close.
imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  meet the pilot.
why did you marry me, miles?  why did we have these two children?  you don't need us.  your heart and your mind are in here.  but it doesn't love you like we do.
excellent.
yeah, i thought you'd like this place.
not even of dying?
no.
you don't feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
no.  i have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  then it doesn't matter.
torque wrench please.
here.  i wish i coulda met my real dad.
you will.
yeah.  i guess so.  my mom says when i'm, like, 45, i think, i send him back through time to 1984.  but right now he hasn't even been born yet.  man, is messes with your head.  where's that other bolt?  thanks.  mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, i guess.  i see her crying sometimes.  she denies it totally, of course.  like she says she got something in her eye.
why do you cry?
you mean people?  i don't know.  we just cry. you know.  when it hurts.
pain causes it?
uh-unh, no, it's different... it's when there's nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  you get it?
no.
alriight!!  my man!
no problemo.
"no fate."  no fate but what we make.  my father told her this... i mean i made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- never mind.  okay, the whole thing goes "the future is not set.  there is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
she intends to change the future somehow.
i guess, yeah --  oh shit!!
dyson.
yeah, gotta be!  miles dyson!  she's gonna blow him away!
this is tactically dangerous.
drive faster.
the t-1000 has the same files that i do.  it could anticipate this move and reacquire you at dyson's house.
i don't care.  we've gotta stop her.
killing dyson might actually prevent the war.
i don't care!! there's gotta be another way. haven't you learned anything?!  haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
please... let... the kids... go...
shut up!  shut up!!  motherfucker!  it's all your fault!  it's your fault!!
mom?  you okay?
i couldn't... oh, god.  you... came here... to stop me?
uh huh.
it's okay.  it'll by okay.  we'll figure it out.
i love you, john.  i always have.
i know, mom.  i know.
do you have bandages?
in the bathroom.  danny, can you get them for us?
my god.
now listen to me very carefully.
yeah.  right.  how were you supposed to know? fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  colt, browning, smith, thompson, kalashnikov... all men.  men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  you're so creative.  you don't know what it's like to really create something... to create a life.  to feel it growing inside you.  all you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
mom, mom, we need to be more constructive here. i don't see this as a gender-related issue.  she's still tense.  we still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  right?
but i thought... aren't we changing things?  i mean... right now?  changing the way it goes?
that's right!  there's no way i'm going to finish the new processor now.  forget it.  i'm out of it.  i'm quitting cyberdyne tomorrow... i'll sell real estate, i don't care,,,
look, whatever you want me to do, i'll do.  i just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
no one must follow your work.
alright, yeah.  you're right.  we have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything i have here.  everything! i don't care.
do you know about the chip?
what chip?
they have it in a vault at cyberdyne...  it's gotta be from the other one like you.
the cpu from the first terminator.
son of a bitch, i knew it!
they told us not to ask where they got it.  i thought... japan... hell, i don't know.  i didn't want to know.
those lying motherfuckers!
i was scary stuff, radically advanced.  it was shattered... didn't work.  but it gave us ideas, it took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  all this work is based on it.
i must be destroyed.
can you get us in there, past security?
is it safe for them here?
take your kids.  go to a hotel.  right now. don't pack.  let's go.
we should abort.
no!! we're going all the way!  you got that, dyson?
no good.
let me try mine.
i got it.  piece of cake.
go!  i'll finish here.
i'll deal with the police.
remember what i said, you can't...
trust me.
ready to rock?
ready.
drive for a minute.
where you going?!
we don't have much time.
what?
john, get out of the way!!
shoot!!!!
is it dead?
terminated.
will it melt in there?
yes.  throw it in.
it's finally over.
no.  there is another chip.
no!
i'm sorry, john.
no, no no!!  it'll be okay.  stay with us!
i have to go away, john.
don't do it.  please... don't go --
it must end here... or i am the future.
i order you not to!
are you afraid?
yes.
