the space shuttle has landed!
hold still, damn it!
what are you doing later?
taking my boyfriend to the airport.
i thought i was your boyfriend.
i do not talk that way.
remember, skiers stay up longer.
shut up, tod!  be serious!
i am serious.
watch it, I am going to fall.  I am going to go!
balance, kelly.  bal-lance!
thank you.
want another one?
well, not much longer to go.
what is it, 97 days?
till this opens, not our wedding.
hope i make it through both.
you will.  I will see to it.
look, kathryn.  they are jealous.
they are acting very strange suddenly.
pre-opening jitters.
i guess.
what kind of trouble?
it is not closing, mike.
that is impossible.
i know.  but we show it is not closing.
okay, okay... we will get someone on it.
damn it.  i can not understand!  i got to go, hon.
do not forget you have your brother.
yeah.
see you later.
bring the crane over.  come down. easy down.
hey.
hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
calvin said it was all right.
yeah, well i didn't!
well, we are not going to hurt it, old boy.  i say, love, is flipper ready to go?
go where?
on the telly.  we are to film him for the evening news.
nobody told me.
i just did.  can you make them do tricks?
they are not tricks.  they are behavior patterns.
fine.  have them do some.
i do not know.  they are nervous and skittish right now.
yes, are not we all.
that macho pompous english --
do not let him get you.  just continue your patterns and pretend he is not around.
my imagination is not that good.
honey, i gotta go.
okay, bye.
make sure you put this back.
aww, can not i keep it?
okay now.  have flipper flip or something.
make this quick!
ahhh, ahhh...
now what?
gotta sneeze.
do not you dare.
can not help it... ahh...
it is no use.  they will not come into the lagoon.
well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
wait a minute.  these are not kangaroos, mr. hutton.  they are dolphins.
i thought they were clever.
i can have them walk backwards.
no, no.  that will not do.
i told you, something is upset them.
well, i have to get this into the networks.  if you can not do it, you can not do it, that is all.
I am sorry.
well, we will just try again, dear. keep working on it.  maybe you will get it one of these years.  pack up, boys.  flipper's a flop.
you called, doctor?
everything's going wrong.  I am having more trouble with bobby than i ever have before.  i can not get him to respond.
how come?
i do not know.  i can not understand it.  something is bothering them.
and what else is bothering you?
... hutton.  he really pisses me off.
yeah, you really do not like him.
i do not like what he does.
it is his work.
he does not need the money.  he inherited a fortune.  he kills for kicks.  tv battles between non-predator fish and divers. the diver always wins.
okay, forget him now.  I am going to pick up sean.  take a ride?
i can not leave now.  we taking sean out?
sure.  want to try that new italian place?
no, you do not need all that starch.  you are getting too fat.
not enough loving.
get out of here!
it is miller time!
you buying?
sure am.
coming with us?  overman's buying.
you see the three-quarter socket?
yeah.  down there.
shit.
hey, what is goin' on, little brother!
damn!  you sonuvabitch!  look at you!
look great, do not i?
got a job for me?
yeah, we will find something for you.  shoveling shark shit or something.
sharks???
in a restaurant.  you sit there and they swim around you.
... I will go to mcdonalds.
how did you do in school?
great.  i got one b, two c's, and eight incompletes.
hey, I am proud of you, kid.
so was dad.
took it this morning.
he needs a haircut.
yeah, right.
how is he?  still fighting crime?
last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  gang of kids were using slugs in the pac-man games.
big bust!  he confiscate their water pistols?
booked them all at baskin- robbins.
that is dad...
he taught us good, though, did not he, sean?  we were lucky to grow up the way we did.
who is grown up?
gee, it is good to see you!
i want to see kathryn.
just find your own.  like dad says, there is plenty of fish in the sea.
give me a ride?
sure.
'preciate it.
so, you just get here?
yeah, from boston.
i was seeing this guy off.  he flew in from dallas.  wants to marry me.  he is okay, but texans are so possessive.
massachussettans aren't.
'course they are also so rich.
... massachussettans aren't.
how long you staying?
i do not know, it depends.
you like florida?
i have not seen that much, but so far it looks great.
well, wait till you see the rest.
you gonna work at the kingdom?
depends on big brother.
I am a water-skier.
are you really?
sure am.
that is too bad.  i do not like water.  i do not like being around in.  i never go in it.
how come?
goes back to when i was a kid. mike's okay, he is gotten over his fears, but i haven't.  i can not even drink it.
come on, let's go.
something wrong?
you know overman?
musclehead?
he is missing.
hope with none of my girl friends.
kelly, could you look after sean for a while?  show him around for me?
sure.  no problem.
thanks.
okay, you two, have a good life without me.  i gotta go.
do not hurry back.
i do not understand.  overman's too good a diver to disappear.
have you checked the bars?  the guy's irresponsible;  he is done this before.
I will need more men to look.
can not help you, mike.  do not have the manpower.
we are going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
i know, but you are just going to have to find another way.  so you better start.
i think they will come out now.
they still seem nervous.
i know.
they are coming with us?
we play hide and seek all the time.  they find a lot of things.
where is the rubber band?
look, michael... you do not have to come.
i do not have a choice.
what do i do now?
take a deep breath and hold it.
that is cute, kathryn.  real cute.
just put your mask on.
honey... you all right?
no.
are you scared?
yes.
damn it!
hi, baby.
baby goddamn scared me to death!
they just wanted to say hello.
... friggin' fish.
let's head to the gate and work our way back.
that is a lot of ground to cover.
i know, i built it.  I have just never seen it this way.
well, i needed a cold shower.
come on!  check this out!
it is romantic down here.
oh, yeah.  very.
you know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
let's not talk about that now, okay?
this is where to be.  high and dry.
and alone.
what is wrong?
nothing.
... if nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
... electrical connection malfunctioning.
you sound like houston mission control.  what the hell does it mean?
that we swim.
swim where?  out there?  oh, no, forget it, not me!  you go, I am staying.
michael, the sub's dead.
yeah, and so will i be if i start swimming in that blackass jungle.
okay, stay.  we will come back for you.
where are you going?
up.
and leave me down here???
make up your mind.
what mind?  if i had a mind, I would never have let you talk me into this.
i talked you into this?
I would have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
are you coming...?
no, i do not want to leave now. I am having too good a time... of course I am coming!  you would think you are going to leave me?
you would, would not you?  I would end up whale shit, you would not care.
get your reserve bottle and let's go.
you all right?
i think so.  I am not sure... are you?
I am okay.
michael...
it is all right, baby.  we are safe...
how the hell did it get in here?
god, they are horrible.  i hate them.  did you see its eyes?  how black they are?  the look in them?
do not think about it.  it is over.
it is never over...  here comes another six years of bad dreams.
what you are saying is we have a great white shark in the lagoon.
and a missing man.
unhappy combination.  most likely one's inside the other.
sharks are man-biters, mister hutton.  not man-eaters --
that is a load of codswopple.  a great white does not fear man.  it does not fear beast.  it is an orgy of food and blood.
i think we can capture it.  I would like to try.
that is preposterous!
go on, doctor.
no one's ever caught a great white except indirectly in fishing nets. i want to dart it and keep it alive.
it would make a marvelous attraction;  the only great white in captivity.
i can get it.
you can get killed!
I have handled sharks before. bigger than this one.
calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
no!
it will chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
calvin, i insist i be allowed to capture it!
three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
it is one of the world's greatest creatures.
a shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  you know how many are born?  maybe five. they eat each other before birth! they are born killers!
the only great white in captivity, calvin.  all those people standing in line...
i will.
well, then I am going to film it.
like hell!
make a lovely item for "good morning, america"
absolutely.  good idea.
with those camera lights and...
he is going with you, doctor.
no, it will be too much distraction.  i do not want that many people in the water.  I will go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
and philip will be there to film it.  now that is the end of it!
i want that shark alive.
so do i, love.
you are going down there again?
yes.
after what happened to us?
i know i can capture it.
kathryn, you are crazy.  really crazy.  a suicidal maniac.
we will shoot this with an .18, boys.
that bugger moves fast.
give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.
i would not mind going down with her.
she is a lovely bit of crumpet at that.
are not you suiting up, mate?
no.
well, do not worry about your fiancee.  we will watch over her.
she can take care of herself. she does not need you.
never know down there.  helps to have a friend, sometimes.
how many sharks have you killed?
me?  i do not know.  twenty, thirty.  i love them, think they are the greatest.
oh, yeah.  really nice.  who is your designer?  sassoon shark?
i got it on sale.  a real steel.
here.
what is that?
bracelets.
fine piece of engineering.
should protect you a little, from the compression.  if that thing gets ahold of you.
thank you.
kathryn...
yes?
let us know as soon as you have anything.
right, mike.
would not this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
it is easier to lure sharks at night.
why?  'cause they are hungrier?
you look like an orange worm.
shark bait.  draws them over for closeups.
what in hell is that?
lunch for whitey.  something to munch on in case things get dicey.
we are taking that shark alive!
let's hope he knows that.
i know it and i will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
why?
because i do not trust you, that is why.
you set that thing off down there, you do not know what will happen.
precisely.
i insist you get rid of that bomb.
afraid i can not do that.
you are supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
look, doctor, this is not one of your pet porpoises we are after. it is a torpedo of muscle. murderous expertise!  I have seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  do not be so concerned about them.  worry about yourself.
we see him, mike.  between the stadium and the ski show island.
all right, hit those lights too.
change your mind?
no.
you amaze me.  I am more scared than you.
no, you are not.
i can use a shot of what he is got.
... me, too.
after this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and i are going away.  just the two of us.  no dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. just you and me.
sounds wonderful.
we will go to palm springs, death valley, arizona desert, anyplace where there is no water.
we are ready for you.
i have to walk him till the drug wears off.
you want me to stay?
get some sleep.  and tell sean I am sorry.
sean, that is right...
watch it, brody.  you are ruining the shot.
kind of dull in there for you, is not it?  why do not you throw in another shark?
he is a young one.
and big for his age.
sean.  sean, where are you?
someone is looking for you.
why do not you take a rest, brian?
I am only walking him.  you caught him.  you have to be exhausted.
go on, you are tired.
no, I am fine, thanks.
how is sleeping beauty?
still sleeping.
kiss him, maybe he will turn into a frog.
should be coming out of it soon.
just watch it when he does.
could be a new dance...  walking the shark.
thanks for helping.
not at all.
why are you?
i like it when they wake up.
so do i.  but for different reasons.
and i like you.
you were quite daring in capturing him.  very skillful indeed.
skillful?  i missed my first shot.
some miss all their shots.
somebody could have gotten hurt.
that is what life is, doctor. full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
you are a strange man, mr. hutton.
philip.
before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  now you are helping to nurse it back to life.
that is because i am the shark.
we are all from the sea, mr. hutton. our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  by continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
the grenade's just to intimidate whitey.  he knows i have it, so he watches out.  same is true when i film lions, tigers, rhinos...
i think that you and i are natural enemies.
and here i thought i was charming you.
hello.  i think his nap's over.
get ready to go.
believe me, i am.
brian, he is coming around!
well, doctor.  you have got your shark.
thanks to you.
finally.
how is your patient?
recovering nicely.
me, too.
mmmm... you smell good.
you don't.
it is my new perfume.  great white, the man-eater.
you want to show this?
absolutely.  the audience will stain their drawers.  i did.
they said you would be here.
what is up?
i need more pressure in the shark tank.
okay.
i want to make sure the white is getting enough flow.  would you do that for me?
sure.  let's go.
no, we will go through here.
... mean through the tubes?
yes.  it is faster.
no,  I am not going through there.
michael, come on, do not be silly. this is the quickest way.  you are not going to walk all the way around?
I am not going to walk through that shark arcade.
they are not going to hurt you. they are encased in plastic.
i do not want to see them, kathryn.
michael, i do not have time. please!  it is time you dealt with this and got over it.  now come on!
calvin wants me to move the white for tomorrow.
... he ought to put him in here.
it is too soon to move him.
so tell calvin.
i did.  he wants it on exhibit.
well, that is why you got it.
honey, what is it?
hydrophobia...
michael, take deep breaths.
i have to get out of here.
come on.
i can not take water, kathryn.
yes, you can.
i can't!  my dad had it, and i do not know if you can inherit it or what, but i got it, and i hate it.  i can not stand it!
back, kelly.  lean back!
ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
when did this happen?
ten minutes ago.
it has not adjusted.
get the hose!  we have got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
i knew it;  it is my fault.  we moved it too soon.
do not blame yourself.
i should have never listened to calvin.
no one's ever done it before. it was a good try...
not good enough.
we got it to live for ten hours. that is some kind of record.
do not feel bad.
okay... have them get it out of the tank.
mike, this is fantastic.  i mean, you are responsible for building all this.  what a job you have done! maybe I will quit school and come down here and work with you. brody brothers construction. we have always wanted to do that together.  boat building.
it is not that easy.  worked construction every summer to get through school.  three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  finish school first, sean.  then make up your mind.  if you still want to work with me, we will have plenty of time.
you and kathryn gonna stay here?
this company's expanding.  they got parks in texas, ohio, california.  i think I am going to be going to waco.
well, dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  is there any chance you and kathryn will get married in amity?
tell dad we are getting married in las vegas.  in one of those chapels.  he can meet us there.
yeah, he will really go for that.
it is all up to kathryn.  amity's fine with me if it is fine with her.
she still talking to you?
we are in love.
sure.
no, really.  I have never met anyone like her before.  this is it.
yeah, right.  that is what you said about janet, and beth, and barbara --
puppy love.  this time it is real! we can have a double wedding.
you were great out there!
did you see me?!  was not i terrific?
as always.
hi, mike.
how you doing, kelly?
I am neo-senephrened out.  think I am catching a cold.
better than catching sean's herpes.
herpes?
why you sonuvabitch...
sean, do you have herpes?
no.  of course not.  do not listen to him.  he is - he's...  ... my brother.
besides that.
i do not know, what else is there?
i know!  we can take the gondola ride!
the one that goes underwater?
yes, it is great!
no, kelly, i do not want to...
come on, it is fun!
not for me.  i do not go in the water, remember?
you are not in the water.  you are in a gondola.
no, think of something else.
sean, this is ridiculous.  you are acting very immature.
I am not acting!  i do not want to go in it, okay?
did you see that?
what?
on monitor three.  was a glimpse of something.
that?
yes, there is goes.
it is disappeared.
your friend overman picked a hell of a time to come back.
yeah, poor bastard.
i lost a good cameraman in australia last year.  a great white chopped him in half with one bite.
hey, i do not want to hear.
that is how they do it, you know. seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
buzz off.
i will, old boy, tomorrow.  our work is done here.  just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
yeah?  well, in that case, have a drink.
thanks.  bullshot.
so where you go off to, hutton? some expedition in new guinea or outer mongolia?
no, south georgia.
what the hell's there?
polar bears.
polar bears in georgia???
south georgia, antarctica.
oh...
the world's southern most reaches.
how come you are so brave with all this stuff?
tradition.  royal sense of adventure that is been in my family for centuries.  dates back to the crusades and king richard.  what i was born to do.
yeah, tradition's a bitch, am not it?
reach for the limit i always say.
I will remember that, my lordship.
put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --
it is a shark's tooth!
so?
it was removed from charlie overman's body.
what is the big deal?  a shark got overman, and we got the shark.
that is just it, michael.  we don't!
what do you mean, we don't?
this tooth is from another shark. a shark that could be 30 feet long!
thirty feet???
actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
that is impossible.  if it is that big, why has not anybody seen it? huh?  tell me that.  it is like not seeing the goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
that is what I have come to ask you. is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?
i do not understand.
sharks have to keep moving.  they can never stop or they will suffocate. if water is not always flowing through them, they will die.
is there such a place?  a cave or something with such a flow?
what did you just say before? about water flowing through them?
that is why they are always moving. they have to have it.
you wanted to know about a cave?
filter system number four.  is it large enough?
it is large enough...
how far away is filter number four?
five hundred yards.
you have a man near it?
somebody better get down there!
it is all controlled from the control room.
I have heard of a white that big, in australia...
how did it get in here?!
he is big as a bloody bus!
the water ski show!  we have to get them out!
come on!
you two go!  I will call calvin!
is not this fun!
can hardly wait to do it again.
told you you would like it.
now what is this do?
goes up.
no...  it can not be.
what, hon?
let's go, let's go!
it is okay, sean.
take it up.
he is diving!
take it up!
sean!
how is he?
couple of fractures, lacerations. they say he is going to be all right.
... i have to go, honey.  phillip and i are going down together to kill the shark.
... okay.
we can assume he is back in the water intake passage.
she, mister hutton.
he.  she.  let's blow the bitch up!
after all, that is how you catch fish, is not it?
you could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
what is your plan, brody?
it is easy.  put a net on the derrick.  put the net in the water by the intake passage. turn off the intake passage. shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
a piece of pie on sunday.
the net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
that is right.
who is going to do it?
me.
michael, you are not going down there.
i am.  you are not.
but you --
it is a construction job.  I am the only one that can do it.
I will go with you.
no way.
I will stay out of your way.  i will not interfere.
I am sure you won't.  but you are going to have to wait till we come up.  then you can film all you want.
michael, you do not have to go down there.
i want that shark, kathryn.
you do not have to prove anything.
only to myself.
are you okay?
I am  fine.
he is big, hutton.  you never saw anything so big.  watch yourself.
always do.
