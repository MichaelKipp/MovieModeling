who was this fuckin' guy?
rock and roll, gus.  johnny boz.
i never heard of him.
before your time, pop.  mid-sixties.  five or six hits. he is got a club down in the fillmore now.
not now he don't.
maybe the maid did it.
she is 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
he left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  that is the last time anybody saw him.
what was it?
talcott does not usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. what are they nervous about?
they are executives.  they are nervous about everything.
keep your three o'clock.
do you want me to work the case, phil, or do you want me to --
i said keep it.
am not that cute?  they got his and her pig-assos, son.
i did not know you knew who picasso was, gus.
I am a smart sonofabitch.  i just hide it.
we are sorry to disturb you, we would like to ask you some --
are you vice?
homicide.
what do you want?
when was the last time you saw john boz?
is he dead?
why do you think he is dead?
you would not be here otherwise, would you?
were you with him last night?
you are looking for catherine, not me.
who are you?
I am roxy.  I am her -- friend.
I am de...
i know who you are.
how did he die?
he was murdered.
really.  maybe that is why you are from homicide.  how?
how long were you dating him?
i was not dating him.  i was fucking him.
how long were you having sex with him?
about a year and a half.
were you with him last night?
yes.
did you leave the club with him?
yes.
did you go home with him?
no.  we had a drink at the club. we left together.  i came here. he went home.
was there anyone with you last night?
no.  i was not in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
i do not really feel like talking anymore.
listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
read me my rights and arrest me and I will go downtown.
how are you, nick?
I am fine.  come on, beth!  you know I am fine!  how the hell long do i have to keep doing this?
as long as internal affairs wants you to, i suppose.  sit down, nick.
it is bullshit.  you know it is.
i know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay?
so -- how are things?
things are fine.  i told you. they are fine.
how is your -- personal life?
my sex life is fine.  my sex life is pretty shitty actually since i stopped seeing you -- maybe i should think about my electrolux again.
how about the booze?
it is been three months.
how about the coke?
no.
no?
no!  I am working my tail off.  I am off the sauce, I am not even smoking anymore.
how is not smoking?
it is fucked -- now will you please tell i.a. that I am just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
yes.
thank you.
how did it go, son?
she misses me.
hallelujah.
she is a suspect.
on what basis?
catherine tramell.  age 30.  no priors, no convictions.  double major, magnum cum laude, berkeley, 1980.  literature and psychology. daughter, sole survivor -- marvin and elaine tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, catherine tramell sole heir.  estimated assets $110 million.
are you kidding me?
formerly engaged to roberto vasquez, deceased --
i love it.  she is got a hundred million bucks.  she fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  and she is got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
you forgot her degree in literature. she is a writer.  she published a novel last year under a pen name. do you want to know what it is about?
so what do we do -- nothing?
we bring her in for questioning.
she is got enough money to burn this whole department down.
she was the last person seen with the guy -- I will take the responsibility.
it is yours.
ms. tramell, we would like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
are you arresting me?
if that is the way you want to play it.
do you always keep old newspapers around?
only when they make interesting reading.
you have the right to an attorney.
why would i need an attorney?
do you have a cigarette?
i do not smoke.
yes, you do.
i quit.
i thought you were out of cigarettes.
i found some in my purse; would you like one?
i told you -- i quit.
it will not last.
you workin' on another book?
yes i am.
it must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time.
it teaches you to lie.
how is that?
you make it up, but it has to be believable.  they call it suspension of disbelief.
i like that.  "suspension of disbelief."
what is your new book about?
a detective.  he falls for the wrong woman.
I am john corrigan.  I am an assistant district attorney, ms.  tramell. can we get you anything?  would you like some coffee?
no thank you.
did i miss something?
i told them you would not want an attorney present.
i told them you would not want to hide.
i have nothing to hide.
there is no smoking in this building, ms. tramell.
what are you going to do?  charge me with smoking?
would you tell us the nature of your relationship with mr. boz?
i had sex with him for about a year and a half.  i liked having sex with him.
did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
exactly what do you have in mind, mr. corrigan.
did you ever tie him up?
no.
but you said you liked men to use their hands.
no.  i said i liked johnny to use his hands.  i do not give any rules, nick.  i go with the flow.
did you kill mr. boz, ms. tramell?
I would have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way i described in my book. I would be announcing myself as the killer.  I am not stupid.
we know you are not stupid, ms. tramell.
maybe that is what you are counting on to get you off the hook.
writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.
yes it does, does not it?
the answer is no.  i did not kill him.
do you use drugs, ms. tramell?
sometimes.
what kind of drugs?
cocaine.
you like playing games, do not you?
I have got a degree in psych.  it goes with the turf.  games are fun.
how did you feel when he died?
i loved him.  i hurt.
how did you feel when i told you johnny boz had died -- that day at the beach.
i felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
but you did not hurt --
no.
because you did not love him --
that is right.
even though you were fucking him.
you still get the pleasure.  did not you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, nick?
in the beginning.  then i got to like what he did for me.
that is pretty cold, am not it, lady?
I am a writer,  i use people for what i write.  you write what you know.  let the world beware.
sure.
thanks.
I am tired.
it is got to be tiring to beat that machine.
if i were guilty, and if i wanted to beat that machine, it would not be tiring.  it would not be tiring at all.
why not?
because I am a professional liar. i spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies.  for my writing.
i passed.
you see?  we are both innocent, nick.
how do you know all this stuff about me?
you know all about me.
i do not know anything that is not police business.
you know i do not like to wear any underwear, do not you, nick?
what is all this "nick" stuff -- nick would you like a cigarette. nick can you give me a ride.
she did not ask me for the ride. she asked anybody.
and you volunteered.
what you doin', son?
it is my first drink in three months. that okay with you, pop?  she does not know me.  i never saw her before gus and i talked to her.
you sure?
I am sure.
now what?
what now what? now nothing.  she passed the polygraph.  that is it.
she knew she could beat it.  that is why she asked to take it.
how the fuck do you know?  what is it with you and this broad anyway?
come on, phil.  you are not going to let this slide.  what about her parents?  what about what else she is published?  at least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that is an amazing real-life coincidence.
her parents died in an accident. i do not care what else she is written.  what are you -- a book critic?
how did they die?  was there an investigation?
how you are saying she killed her parents?  did she kill bobby vasquez, too?
not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
maybe she did, gus.  maybe she grew herself an afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
fuck you, phil.
fuck you, too nick.
you okay?
yeah.
you do not look so okay.
what are you doing here?
baby-sitting.  rookie cop.
what else is new?
maybe it is for old-time's sake.
sometimes i think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with internal affairs.
he am not that way.  he is got heart.
yeah.  i know.
what was she like?
who?
catherine tramell.
she said what you said she would say.
we were in some of the same classes.
why did not you tell me?
i need a cigarette.
i thought you quit.
you look like dogshit.
he looks a little shrunk, that is all.
we got a call from berkeley p.d. there was a killing.  a professor. icepick.  in his bed.  multiple stab wounds.  1977.
she was there, was not she?
gus -- go over to berkeley. harrigan -- find out what else she is published.  andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. carbon beth on everything.  i want some psychological input on this andrews and harrigan go; nick is left there with gus.
what about me?
you are already gettin' psychological input, son.
go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  see where she leads.
am not you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
what are you doing here, pop?
i came in here to jack off the damn machine.  one dead psychology professor. noah goldstein.  dr. noah goldstein. and guess what?  he was her counselor.
was she ever suspect?
no, sir.  they never even got a statement from her.
do you remember a case -- 1956 -- hazel dobkins?
hell yes!  could not get it outta my head for years.  still can't. nice little kids -- nice husband, was not porkin' around -- no financial problems.  one day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em.  all of 'em.  used a knife. he got for a wedding present. did not even deny it.  sweet as honey.  said she did not know why she done it.
am i... disturbing you?
no.  come in.
would you like a drink?  i was just going to have one.
no, thanks.
I would like to ask you a few more questions.
I would like to ask you some, too.
you tell me.
i do not know.  but you do.
it was an accident.  they got in the line of fire.
four shootings in five years.  all accidents.
they were drug buys.  i was a vice cop.
tell me about professor goldstein.
there is a name from the past.
you want a name from the present? how about hazel dobkins?
noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  that is probably where i got the idea for the icepick.  for my book. funny how the subconscious works.  hazel is my friend.
she wiped out her whole family.
yes.  she is helped me understand homicidal impulse.
did not you study it in school?
only in theory.  you know all about homicidal impulse, do not you, shooter?  not in theory -- in practice.
what happened, nick?  did you get sucked into it? did you like it too much?
no.
i didn't.
yes, you did.  they never tested you, did they?  but internal affairs knew.
what are you talking about, nick -- what is wrong with you?
who is got access to my goddamn file?
it is a confidential psychiatric record, it would be illegal --she backs into a wall.  she looks very scared. he comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.
don't, beth.  do not lie to me.
it is internal affairs, is not it?
no, nick, please --
who?
nilsen.
what is goin' down, son?
nothin'  I will be okay, pop.
no, sir.  you won't.  there is smoke off yonder on the horizon.  they are going to want your badge.
i got tired of being played with.
you sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that.
she knows where i live and breathe. she is coming after me.
what is it you got between you?
i do not know.
somethin', though.
i do not owe you anything; you do not owe me anything.  we went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  it was not memorable enough to carry any obligations.
sometimes i really hate you.
yeah?  well why do not you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out.  but take my advice.  put a little more life into it than you usually do.
you did it for me.
yes.  i care about you.  i did it for you.
you think i --
i do not son, but i got the minority opinion.
okay.  i went after him.  i lost my temper.
do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
no.
where were you tonight?
home. watching tv.
all night?
yeah.
were you drinking?
yeah, i was drinking.
when did you start drinking again?
a couple days ago.
there is no smoking in this building.
what are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
I will ask you once, nick -- for the record did you kill him?
no.
come on -- I am going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I am going to kill him?  I would have to be really dumb to do that.
going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that is your alibi.
i do not think it is funny.
well, hell, son, it is got a certain ring to it, I will say that.
it is the least i could do... considering i got you into this mess with those reports.
no.  i mean it, thank you.
how do you know catherine tramell saw my reports?
she knows stuff about me that only you know.
she must really be something.  from a clinical point of view.
what was she like in school?
i hardly knew her.  she gave me the creeps, though.  i do not know why.
beth.  i did not mean what i said. about --
yes you did.  I am a big girl.  i can handle it.
take care, you hear?
did you find out about her parents?
you are on leave, man.  you are on psycho leave.  I am talking to a possible whacko here.
you know I am whacko, sam, what did you find?
the boat blew.  there was a leak in the gas line.  there were two previous repairs.  there was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  a real heavy investigation.  zilch. goose-egg.  it was an accident.
thanks.
i.a.'s going to talk to you more about nilsen.  they are handling the investigation, we are not. stay in touch with dr. gardner, it will help on the evaluation.
she killed him.
beth?  now you have got beth killing people?
catherine tramell.  it is part of her game.
first you have got her buying your file.  now you have got her killing nilsen.  forget her, willya?  go someplace.  sit in the sun.  get away from this goddamn fog.  get her out of your system.
you do not but it, do you?  she knew nobody would but it.  she knew I would say she did it.  and she knew nobody would buy it.
how exactly did you hear?
i have attorneys.  they have friends.  i have friends.  money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
i do not know about that i do not have any money i do not have any attorneys gus is my only real friend.
i was not talking about real friends. why does not gus like me.
i like you.
do you?
yeah.  would you like to come up and have a drink?
you are not easy to figure.  I am just very good at figuring.
do not get too cocky.
why not?
you can make a mistake.
not me.
jack daniel's okay?  it is going to have to be.
fine.
ice?
please.
what did you pay nilsen?
is not he the policeman that you shot, shooter?
what if i asked you not to call me shooter?
what if i call you nicky?
my wife used to call me that.
i know, nicky, but i like it.
cheers.  my friends call me catherine.
what did bobby vasquez used to call you?
bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  you do not have any coke, do you?  i love coke and jack daniel's.
there is pepsi in the fridge.
it is not the same thing, is it?
say -- "what do you want from me, catherine?"
what do you want from me, catherine?
are not you going to thank me?
what is it about?
a boy kills his parents.  they have a plane.  he makes it look like an accident.
why does he do it?
to see if he can get away with it.
when did you write it?
you mean did i write it before my parents died?
yes.
no.  i wrote it years afterwards.
you are not going to stop following me around now just because you are on leave -- are you?
no.
good.  I would miss you.  you can get into trouble, though. you are not really a cop anymore.
I will risk it.
why take the risk?
to see if i can get away with it.
how is your new book?
I am getting deeper and deeper into my character.
I am leaving the house around midnight.  in case you are going to follow me.  I am going down to johnny's club.
I will meet you there.
forgive me for askin', son, and i do not mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you have got your head so far up your own ass?
she want to play?  fine.  i can play.
everybody that she plays with dies.
i know what that is like.
maybe she saw something she did not see before.
she is seen everything before.
did you think it was so special?
i told her it was the fuck of the century.
what did you think?
i thought it was a pretty good beginning.
how about roxy?  is she a fuck to the century, too?
do you want her to join us sometime?
how is your shoulder?
fine.  how is your back?
it hurts.
are you kidding?  you think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  i do not do those.
i thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
i told you i had a vivid imagination.
you should not play this game.
i do not have a choice.
you are in over your head.
i know.
easy there, partner -- i was not there.
i went over last night, too.
i was not there last night, either.
you... fucked her!  goddamn dumb sonofabitch... you fucked her! goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
I am not going to get aids, pop --don't worry about it.  i always use a rubber.
i do not give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about aids!
you oughta use a rubber, pop.  you really should.
what in the hell for?  you think I am gettin' any at my age?  i do not like blue-haired women.  i do not like 'em.
you do not like punk rockers?
say what?
you feeling better?
i feel fine!
I am not afraid of her.
why the hell not?
i do not know.  I am just not.
that is her pussy talkin' --he gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  he winks at her.  the woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
it does not make sense.  she did not know me three months ago.
maybe it was not her that paid him. maybe the money was for somethin' else.  how the fuck do i know? I am just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
you all right, pop?  you want me to drive you?
in that little pissant car of yours? hell, no.  i am not gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I am gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate seiko watch.
come on, I will drive you in this thing.
you think I would let you drive my cadillac car?  i am not lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my cadillac car.
tell me again.  i want to hear you say it again.
it was an accident.
you are driving around north beach for no particular reason and this car will not get out of the way --
i do not think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
do not fuck with me, nick.  i do not need a reason to put your ass in a sling.
you knew her, did not you?
gus and i talked to her at tramell's house.  all we did was write her name down.
i told you to stay away from tramell.
yeah.  but you did not tell me to stay away from her car.
i want you in dr. gardner's office at nine o'clock.  you are out of control, curran.
who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
what is your problem?  I am trying to help you.  why will not you let me help you?
i do not need any help.
yes you do.  something is on with you.  you are sleeping with her, are not you?
what is this interest you have got in her?
my interest is in you, not in her. she seduces people, she manipulates --
i thought you hardly know her.
i know the type.  I am a psychologist.
i should have known.  i came into the house when you were down on the beach.  she looked at me so strangely.  she left right after you.  i should not have let her watch us. she wanted to watch me all the time.  she tried to kill you, did not she?
did you like her to watch?
do you think i told her to kill you?
no.
everybody that i care about dies.
it is ok.  it is ok.
make love to me.
do you think she killed johnny boz?
for what... to set me up?  she loved me she would not frame me.
maybe she got jealous of johnny boz, too.
no, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  i do not have luck with women. there was this girl i met while i was in college.  i slept with her once.  she started following me around, taking my picture.  she dyed her hair, copied my clothes. lisa something... oberman.  it was awful.
i thought you did not do adolescent secrets.
i never have before.
no.
no?
no more games, nick.  I am tired of playing games!
you will not believe me.
try me.
i paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
when?
about three months before i met you.
why?
I would read about your shootings in the papers.  i decided to write a book about a detective.  i wanted to know my character.
you paid $50,000 for your character?
i would have paid more.  i wanted to know everything about you.  then you came down here after johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
what about the other night. what about last night?  was that to get to know your character?
maybe I am losing interest in my book.
do you believe me?
i do not know.
I will convince you.
catherine says you do not like her.
she is right.  you got an icepick in you yet?
what did he say?
he asked if i had an icepick in me yet.
funny.
you know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?
i do not believe it.
why not?
you are my friend, gus.
how old was she when this happened?
fourteen.  we seal juvenile records until they are deceased.  that is why you did not find it in your computer.
what was the motive?
she said she did not know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  the razor just happened to be there.
i do not understand what the hell's going on here, pop.
am not that hard, son.  this young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em.  just like 'ole hazel dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young roxy here, she did not use a wedding present.  she used daddy's razor.
I am not sure anymore she did it.
which one you talkin' about now, son?  we know ole hazel did it; we know young roxy did it -- and the other one well, hell, she is got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
anderson.  jack w. donald m.  I am sorry.  no lisa.
did you check all four years?
yes i did.
can you check again?
no lisa anderson, detective.
can there be some mistake?
only if you are making it.
can i talk to you a minute?
honey, why do not you go in the car?  I will be right there.
you like to hang out with murderers or what?  did you know roxy --
of course i knew.
i can get my butt kicked for this. you are not supposed to be in here.
it is not going to take long, sam.
hey, that is dr. gardner, is not it?
bring 1976 up.
what do you want, nick?
tell me about catherine.
she told you, did not she?
what did she tell me, beth?
i slept with her once in school.  i was just a kid.  i was experimenting.  it was just that one time.  she developed a... fixation... on me.  she styled her hair like mine. she wore the same kind of clothes i did.  it scared me.
i did dye my hair.  it did not have anything to do with her.  i was a redhead for a while, too.
did you know noah goldstein?
i had him in two classes.
you saw all the reports, beth!
she is really sick you know.  do not you know what she is doing?  she knows i went to berkeley.  she knows i knew noah.  she makes up that story about me.  she is handing you somebody who is obsessed with he her.
she did not hand you to me.  she does not even know who you are. she told me about lisa henderson.
she knew you would find out who lisa henderson is.  you are a good cop -- what did she do?  tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant?  did she tell you in bed, nick? that is how I would do it.
why did you change your name?
i got married.  he was on staff at the clinic.  i was down in salinas.  it didn't... last long.
you should do something about this lock.
she is evil.  she is brilliant.  be careful, nick.
i just thought I would surprise you.  what is the matter?
i found lisa henderson.
did you?  what is she doing?
you are not going to tell me what she is doing.  i thought we were not playing games anymore.
i did, too.  she told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
you still think i kill people, do not you?
no.
liar.
so nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  you do not know what the hell was in it?
catherine told me what was in it.
if she is telling  you the truth.
do not you get it, gus?  if beth killed johnny boz to frame catherine -- she would not want anyone to know what happened at berkeley.  it gives her the motive to kill nilsen.
how did she know nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
he was i.a.  he probably asked her about it.
she would have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound christmas fruitcake. she is not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is.
she is a writer -- it is part of what she does.
goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  there is got to be somebody at berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
i know what happened.  catherine told me what happened.
you got goddamn tweety-birds flutterin' around your head, that is what you got.  you think you are going to fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after?  oh, man.
how did you get in here?
i decided to give you one more chance.  i missed you.
you did not not see me long enough to miss me.
did you miss me?
no.
come over here and tell me no.
i have to do some research tomorrow.
I am very good at research.  I will help you.
no thanks.
what are you researching?
I am writing a book.
really.  what are you writing about.
a detective.  he falls for the wrong girl.
what happens to them?
they fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
it will not sell.
why not?
somebody has to die.
why?
somebody always does.
he died -- about five or six years ago.
he was shot.
he was walking home from work. they only lived a coupla blocks from the clinic.  somebody drove by and shot him.
what was the weapon?
.38 revolver.  never recovered.
were there ever any suspects?
no suspects, no motive.  unsolved.
was his wife ever a suspect?
i had another one of you guys down here from frisco -- about a year ago -- he asked me the same question.  what is this about anyway?
routine.
yeah, he said it was routine too. now it is two guys saying it is routine.
do you remember his name?
nope, can not say that i do.
nilsen?
that is him.
was she ever a suspect?
nope.  there was some talk; it never panned.
what kind of talk?
the usual -- a girlfriend.
he had a girlfriend?
nope. she did.  like i say.  it never panned.
thanks.
i hope i helped you out.
you did.
i finished my book.
