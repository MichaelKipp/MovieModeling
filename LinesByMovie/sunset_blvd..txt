joseph c. gillis?
that is right.
we have come for the car.
what car?
relax, fans.  the car is not here.
is that so?
i lent it to a friend of mine. he took it up to palm springs.
had to get away for his health, i suppose.
you do not believe me?  look in the garage.
sure we believe you, only now we want you to believe us.  that car better be back here by noon tomorrow, or there is going to be fireworks.
you say the cutest things.
all right, gillis.  you have got five minutes.  what is your story about?
it is about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that is batting 347.  the poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  but he is trying to go straight -- except there is a bunch of gamblers who will not let him.
so they tell the kid to throw the world series, or else, huh?
more or less.  only for the end I have got a gimmick that is real good.
got a title?
bases loaded.  there is a 4o-page outline.
get the readers' department and see what they have on bases loaded.
hello, mr. sheldrake.  on that bases loaded.  i covered it with a 2-page synopsis.  but i would not bother.
what is wrong with it?
it is from hunger.
nothing for ladd?
just a rehash of something that was not very good to begin with.
I am sure you will be glad to meet mr. gillis.  he wrote it.
this is miss kramer.
schaefer.  betty schaefer.  and right now i wish i could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
if i could be of any help...
I am sorry, mr. gillis, but i just do not think it is any good. i found it flat and banal.
exactly what kind of material do you recommend?  james joyce? dostoosvsky?
name dropper.
i just think pictures should say a little something.
oh, you are one of the message kids.  just a story will not do. you would have turned down gone with the wind.
no, that was me.  i said, who wants to see a civil war picture?
perhaps the reason i hated bases loaded is that i knew your name. I would always heard you had some talent.
that was last year.  this year I am trying to earn a living.
so you take plot 27-a, make it glossy, make it slick --
carefull those are dirty words! you sound like a bunch of new york critics.  thank you, miss schaefer.
goodbye, mr. gillis.
well, seems like zanuck's got himself a baseball picture.
mr. sheldrake, i do not want you to think i thought this was going to win any academy award.
of course, we are always looking for a betty hutton.  do you see it as a betty hutton?
frankly, no.
now wait a minute.  if we made it a girls' softball team, put in a few numbers.  might make a cute musical: it happened in the bull pen -- the story of a woman.
you trying to be funny?  -- because I am all out of laughs.  I am over a barrel and i need a job.
sure, gillis.  if something should come along -
along is no good.  i need it now.
have not got a thing.
any kind of assignment.  additional dialogue.
there is nothing, gillis.  not even if you were a relative.
look, mr. sheldrake, could you let me have three hundred bucks yourself, as a personal loan?
could i?  gillis, last year some- body talked me into buying a ranch in the valley.  so i borrowed money from the bank so i could pay for the ranch.  this year i had to mortgage the ranch so i could keep up my life insurance so i could borrow on the insurance so i could pay my income tax.  now if dewey had been elected -
goodbye, mr. sheldrake.
so you need three hundred dollars? of course, i could give you three hundred dollars.  only I am not going to.
no?
gillis, get this through your head.  I am not just your agent. it is not the ten per cent.  I am your friend.
how is that about your being my friend?
do not you know the finest things in the world have been written on an empty stomach?  once a talent like yours gets into that mocambo- romanoff rut, you are through.
forget romanoff's.  it is the car I am talking about.  if i lose my car it is like having my legs out off.
greatest thing that could happen to you.  now you will have to sit behind that typewriter.  now you will have to write.
what do you think I have been doing? i need three hundred dollars.
maybe what you need is another agent.
i just put my car in the garage. i had a blow-out.  i thought --
go on in.
look, maybe I would better take my car --
wipe your feet!
you are not dressed properly.
dressed for what?
suppose you listen just for a minute -
madame is waiting.
for me?  okay.
i would not know.
i do not care anyway.  i want the coffin to be white.  and i want it specially lined with satin. white, or deep pink.
how much will it be?  i warn you - do not give me a fancy price just because I am rich.
lady.  you have got the wrong man.
i had some trouble with my car. flat tire.  i pulled into your garage till i could get a spare. i thought this was an empty house.
it is not.  get out.
I am sorry, and I am sorry you lost your friend, and i do not think red is the right color.
get out.
sure.  wait a minute -- have not i seen you -- ?
or shall i call my servant?
i know your face.  you are norma desmond.  you used to be in pictures.  you used to be big.
i am big.  it is the pictures that got small.
i knew there was something wrong with them.
they are dead.  they are finished. there was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world.  but that was not good enough.  oh, nol they wanted the ears of the world, too.  so they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
that is where the popcorn business comes in.  you buy yourself a bag and plug up your ears.
look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! they took the idols and smashed them.  the fairbankses and the chaplins and the gilberts and the valentinos. and who have they got now?  some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
do not get sore at me.  I am not an executive.  I am just a writer.
you are! writing words, words! you have made a rope of words and strangled this businessl but there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles, and technicolor to photograph the red, swollen tongue!
ssh! you will wake up that monkey.
get out!
just a minute, you!
yeah?
you are a writer, you said.
why?
are you or are not you?
i think that is what it says on my driver's license.
and you have written pictures, have not you?
sure have.  the last one i wrote was about cattle rustlers. before they were through with it, the whole thing played on a torpedo boat.
the wind gets in that blasted pipe organ.  i ought to have it taken out.
or teach it a better tune.
how long is a movie script these days?  i mean, how many pages?
depends on what it is -- a donald duck or joan or arc.
this is to be a very important picture.  i have written it myself.  took me years.
looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
it is the story or salome.  i think I will have demille direct it.
uh-huh.
we have made a lot of pictures together.
and you will play salome?
who else ?
only asking.  i did't know you were planning a comeback.
i hate that word.  it is a return. a return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
fair enough.
salome -- what a woman! what a part! the princess in love with a holy man.  she dances the dance of the seven veils.  he rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
they will love it in pomona.
they will love it every place.  read it.  read the scene just before she has him killed!
right now?  never let another writer read your stuff.  he may steal it.
i am not afraid.  read it!
bring something to drink.
yes.  madame.
well?
this is fascinating.
of course it is.
maybe it is a little long and maybe there are some repetitions... but you are not a professional writer.
i wrote that with my heart.
sure you did.  that is what makes it great.  what it needs is a little more dialogue.
what for?  i can say anything i want with my eyes.
it certainly could use a pair of shears and a blue pencil.
i will not have it butchered.
of course not.  but it ought to be organized.  just an editing job.  you can find somebody.
who?  I would have to have somebody i can trust.  when were you born -- i mean, what sign of the zodiac?
i do not know.
what month?
december twenty-first.
sagittarius.  i like sagittarians. you can trust them.
thank you.
i want you to do this work.
me?  I am busy.  just finished one script.  I am due on another assignment.
i do not care.
you know, I am pretty expensive. i get five hundred a week.
i would not worry about money. I will make it worth your while.
maybe I would better take the rest of the script home and read it -
oh no.  i could not let it out of my house.  you will have to finish it here.
it is getting kind of late --
are you married, mr.  -- ?
the name is gillis.  I am single.
where do you live?
hollywood.  the alto nido apart- ments.
there is something wrong with your car, you said.
there sure is.
you can stay here.
I will come early tomorrow.
i made your bed this afternoon.
thanks.  how did you know i was going to stay, this afternoon?
this room has not been used for a long time.
it will never make house beautiful. i guess it is o.k. for one night.
there is the bathroom.  i put in soap and a toothbrush.
thanks.  say, she is quite a character, that norma desmond.
she was the greatest.  you would not know.  you are too young.  in one week she got seventeen thousand fan letters.  men would bribe her mani- curist to get clippings from her fingernails.  there was a maharajah who came all the way from hyderabad to get one of her stockings.  later, he strangled himself with it.
i sure turned into an interesting driveway.
you did, sir. gillis' voice he goes out.  gillis     i pegged him as slightly looks after him, hangs   cuckoo, too.  a stroke maybe. his coat over a chair,   come to think of it, the walks over to the win-   whole place seemed to have dow, pulls down the      been stricken with a kind of rickety venetian blind.  creeping paralysis, out of as he does so, he looks  beat with the rest of the down at:                 world, crumbling apart in slow motion ...
I am talking to you.  my clothes and things are up in the room.
naturally.  i brought them myself.
is that so!
why are you so upset?  is there anything missing?
who said you could?  who asked you to?
i do not know why you should be so upset.  stop that playing, max.  it seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
look, I am supposed to fix up your script.  there is nothing in the deal about my staying here.
you will like it here.
thanks for the invitation, but i have my own apartment.
you can not work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
I will take care of that.
it is all taken care of.  it is all paid for.
I am used to paying my own bills.
you proud boy, why did not you tell me you were having difficulties.
okay.  we will deduct it from my salary.
now, now, do not let's be small about such matters.  we will not keep books.  go on, unpack mr. gillis' things.
unpack nothing.  i did not say i was staying.
suppose you make up your mind. do you want this job or do not you?
what is that?
just a scene i cut out.
what scene?
the one where you go to the slave market.  you can cut right to the scene where john the baptist -
cut away from me?
honestly, it is a little old hat. they do not want that any more.
they don't?  then why do they still write me fan letters every day. why do they beg me for my photo- graphs?  because they want to see me, me, me!  norma desmond.
okay.
some men are here.  they asked for you.
I am not here.
that is what i told them.
good.
they found your car in the garage.  they are going to tow it away.
i want to talk to you for a minute.
not now, my dear.  I am playing three no trump.
they have come for my car.
please.  now I have forgotten how many spades are out.
i need some money right now.
can not you wait till I am dummy?
now what is it?  where is the fire?
I have lost my car.
oh...and i thought it was a matter of life and death.
it is to me.  that is why i came to this house.  that is why i took this job -- ghost writing!
now you are being silly.  we do not need two cars.  we have a car.  and not one of thuse cheap new things made of chromium and spit.  an isotta-fraschini.  have you ever heard of isotta-fraschinis?  all hand-made.  cost me twenty-eight thousand dollars.
that is a dreadful shirt you are wearing.
what is wrong with it?
nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station.  and I am getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants.  max, what is a good men's shop in town?  the very best... well, go there !
i do not need any clothes, and i certainly do not want you buy- ing them for --
why begrudge me a little fun? i just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.
how about some evening clothes?
i do not need a tuxedo.
of course you do.  a tuxedo and tails.
tails.  that is ridiculous.
you will need them for parties. you will need them for new year's eve.  where are your evening clothes?
whose room was this?
it was the room of the husband. or of the husbands, i should say. madame has been married three times.
hey, what is this with the door? there is not any lock.
there are no locks anywhere in this house.
how come?
the doctor suggested it.
what doctor?
madame's doctor.  she has moments of melancholy.  there have been some suicide attempts.
uh-huh?
we have to be very careful.  no sleeping pills, no razor blades. we shut off the gas in her bed- room.
why?  her career?  she got enough out of it.  she is not forgotten. she still gets those fan letters.
i would not look too closely at the postmarks.
you send them.  is that it, max?
I would better press your evening clothes, sir.  you have not for- gotten madame's new year's party.
no, i haven't.  i suppose all the waxworks are coming?
i do not know, sir.  madame made the arrangements.
joe,  you look absolutely divine.  turn around!

come on!
all padding.  do not let it fool you.
come here!
you know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
i do not like those studs they have sent.  i want you to have pearls. nice big pearls.
now, I am not going to wear ear- rings, i can tell you that.
cute.  let's have some drinks.
should not we wait for the others?
careful, it is slippery.  i had it waxed.
not on the same floor with valentino!
just follow me.
do not bend back like that.
it is those feathers.  they tickle.
it is a quarter past ten.  what time are they supposed to get here?
who?
the other guests?
there are no other guests.  we do not want to share this night with other people.  this is for you and me.
i understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the metropolitan and sat there listening to la traviata, all by himself.  he was afraid of catching cold.
hold me tighter.
come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on max's head?
you think this is all very funny.
a little.
is it funny that I am in love with you?
what is that?
I am in love with you.  do not you know that? I have been in love with you all along.
what are the notes?
"mad about the boy."
norma, i can not take it.  you have bought me enough.
shut up.  I am rich.  I am richer than all this new hollywood trash. I have got a million dollars.
keep it.
i own three blocks downtown. i have oil in bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. what is it for but to buy us anything we want.
cut out that us business.
what is the matter with you?
what right do you have to take me for granted?
what right? do you want me to tell you?
has it ever occurred that i may have a life of my own? that there may be some girl I am crazy about?
who? some car hop, or a dress extra?
why not? what I am trying to say is that I am all wrong for you. you want a valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot --
what you are trying to say is that you do not want me to love you.  is that it?
well, what do you know ! joe gillis !
hi, artie.
where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours?
in a deep freeze.
i almost reported you to the bureau of missing persons.  fans, you all know joe gillis, the well-known screen writer, opium smuggler and black dahlia suspect.
give me your coat.
let it ride for a while.
you are going to stay, are not you?
that was the general idea.
come on.
judas e. priest, who did you borrow that from? adolphe menjou?
close, but no cigar.
say, you are not really smuggling opium these days,  are you?
where is the bar?
good party.
the greatest.  they call me the elsa maxwell of the assistant directors.  hey, easy on the punch bowl.  budget only calls for three drinks per extra. fake the rest.
listen, artie, can i stick around here for a while?
sure, this'll go on all night.
i mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks?
it just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch.
I will take it.
I will have the bell-hop take care of your luggage.
let me help you.  betty schaeter, sheldrake's office.
sure.  bases loaded.
wait a minute.  this is the woman i love.  what is going on? who was loaded?
do not worry.  she is just a fan for my literary output.
hurt feelings department.
about that luggage.  where is the phone?
you forgot this.
thanks.
I have been hoping to run into you.
what for? to recover that knife you stuck in my back?
i felt a little guilty, so i got out some of your old stories.
why, you sweet kid.
there is one called....window... something with a window.
dark windows.  how did you like it?
i didn't.
thank you.
except for about six pages. you have got a flashback there ...
is there someplace we can talk?
how about the rainbow room?
now if i got you correctly, there was a short stretch of my fiction you found worthy of notice.
the flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
i had a teacher like that once.
maybe that is why it is good. it is true, it is moving.  now why do not you use that character...
who wants true? who wants moving?
drop that attitude.  here's some- thing really worth while.
want me to start right now? maybe there is some paper around.
I am serious.  I have got a few ideas.
I have got some ideas myself.  one of them being this is new year's eve.  how about living it up a little?
as for instance?
well....
we could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  or should we just turn on the shower?
how about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door?
are you hungry?
hungry? after twelve years in the burmese jungle.  i am starving, lady agatha -- starving for a white shoulder --
phillip, you are mad!
no, phillip, no.  we must be strong.  you are still wearing the uniform of the coldstream guards!  furthermore, you can have the phone now.
o.k.  i find I am terribly afraid of losing you.
you won't.  I will get us a refill of this awful stuff.
you will be waiting for me?
with a wildly beating heart.
life can be beautiful!
how is she?
she is upstairs.
go away.
what kind of a silly thing was that to do?
to fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
it sure would have made attractive headlines: great star kills her- self for unknown writer.
great stars have great pride.
go away.  go to that girl of yours.
look, i was making that up because i thought the whole thing was a mistake.  i did not want to hurt you. you have been good to me.  you are the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me.
why do not you just say thank you and go, go, go --
not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
I will do it again, I will do it again, I will do it again!
wait a minute.  i want you to get out the car.  you are going to take the script over to paramount and deliver it to mr. de mille in person.
yes, madame.
you are really going to send it to de mille?
this is the right day.
did she read the script?
demille is leo.  I am scorpio. mars has been transmitting jupiter for weeks.  today is the day of greatest conjuction. now turn around.  let me dry you.
i hope you realize, norma, that scripts do not sell on astrologers' charts.
I am not just selling the script. I am selling me.  demille always said i was his greatest star.
when did he say it, norma?
so he said it quite a few years ago.  so what?  i never looked better in my life.  do you know why?  because I have never been as happy in my life.
have one of mine.
they are awful.  they make me cough.
pull up at the drugstore, will you, max.  I will get you some.
you are a darling.
hello, artie.  good evening, miss schaefer.
you do not know how glad i am to see youl
walking out on the mob.  what is the big idea?
I am sorry about new year's. would you believe me if i said i had to be with a sick friend?
someone in the formal set, no doubt, with a ten-carat kidney stone.
stop it, artie, will you?  where have you been keeping your- self? I have got the most wonderful news for you.
i have not been keeping myself at all.  not lately.
i called your agent.  i called the screen writers guild.  finally your old apartment gave me some crestview number.  there was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  you were not there.  you were not to be spoken to.  they never heard of you.
is that so? what is the wonderful news?
sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
what teacher?
dark windows.  i got him all hopped up about it.
you did?
he thinks it could be made into something.
into what? a lampshade?
into something for barbara stan- wyck.  they have a commitment with barbara stanwyck.
o.k.  where is the cash?
where is the story? i bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. it is really just a springboard. it needs work.
i was afraid of that.
I have got twenty pages of notes. I have got a pretty good character for the man.
sorry, miss schaefer, but I have given up writing on spec.
i tell you this is half sold.
as a matter of fact.  I have given up writing altogether.
mr. gillis, if you please.
right with you.
the accent! I have got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. get those studs.  get those cuff-links.
I have got to run along.  thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
it is not your career -- it is mine. i kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  i do not want to be a reader all my life.  i want to write.
sorry if i crossed you up.
you sure have.
so long.
what on earth, darling? it took you hours.
i ran into some people i knew.
where are my cigarettes?
where are your...?
i can still see myself in the line: bebe daniels, marie prevost, mabel normand ... mabel was always stepping on my feet ...what's the matter with you, darling?  why are you so glum?
nothing is the matter.  I am having a great time.  show me some more.
all right.  give me this.  i need it for a moustache.  now close your eyes.
madame is wanted on the telephone.
you know better than to interrupt me.
paramount is calling.
who?
paramount studios.
now, now do you belive me? i told you demille would jump at it.
it is not mr. demille in person. it is someone by the name or gordon cole.  he says it is very important.
certainly it is important.  it is important enough for mr. demille to call me personally.  the idea of having an assistant call me!
i myself was surprised at mr. de mille's manners.
say that I am busy, and hang up.
very good, madam.
how do you like that? we have made twelve pictures together. his greatest successes.
maybe demille is shooting.
i know that trick! he wants to belittle me.  he is trying to get my price down.  I have waited twenty years for this call.  now mr. demille can wait till I am good and ready.
if you will pardon me, madame. the shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced.
thank you, max.
i hate to think where that puts me.  i could be her father.
I am terribly sorry, mr. de mille.
it must be about that appalling script of hers.  what can i say to her? what can i say?
i can tell her you are all tied up in the projection room.  i can give her the brush ...
listen, thirty million fans have given her the brush. is not that enough?
i did not mean to --
of course you didn't.  you did not know norma desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
i hear she was a terror to work with.
she got to be.  a dozen press agents working overtime can do terrible things to the human spirit.  hold everything.
do not you want to come along, darling?
i do not think so.  it is your script.  it is your show. good luck.
thank you, darling.
hello, young fellow.
hello, mr. demille.
last time i saw you was someplace very gay.  i remember waving to you. i was dancing on a table.
lots of people were.  lindbergh had just landed in paris.  come on in.
norma, i want to apologize for not calling you.
you would better.  I am very angry.
I am pretty busy, as you can see...
that is no excuse.  you read the script, did not you?
yes, i did.
then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
what assistant?
do not play innocent.  somebody named gordon cole.
gordon cole?
and if you had not been pretty darned interested in that script, he would not have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
gordon cole... look, norma, I am in the middle of a rehearsal.  make yourself comfortable.
did you see them? did you see how they came?
you know, crazy things happen in this business.  i hope you have not lost your sense of humor ...
what is the matter, norma?
nothing.  i just did not realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio.  i had no idea how I would missed it.
we have missed you too, dear.
we will be working again, will not we, chief? we will make our greatest picture.
that is what i want to talk to you about.
it is a good script, is not it?
it is got a lot of good things.  of course, it would be an expensive picture...
i do not care about the money. i just want to work again.  you do not know what it means to know that you want me.
nothing would thrill me more -- if it were possible.
but remember, darling -- i do not work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
we are ready with the shot, mr. demille.
you will pardon me, norma? why do not you just sit and watch?  o.k.  here we go.
roll 'em.
action! the scene starts.
you see those offices there, mr. gillis? they used to be her dressing room, the whole row.
that did not leave much for wallace reid.
he had a great big bungalow on wheels.  i had the upstairs.  see where it says 'readers' department'? i remember my walls were covered with black patent leather...
just so you do not think I am a complete swine -- if there is anything in dark windows you can use, take it.  it is all yours.
well, for heaven's sake!
i mean it.  it is no good to me anyway.  help yourself.
why should you do that?
if you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  if you get an oscar, i get the left foot.
you know, I would take you up on that in a minute.  I am just not good enough to do it all by myself.
what about all those ideas you had?
see if they make sense.  to begin with, i think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
this story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  to me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
check.
now i see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  the first time they meet ...
look, if you do not mind, i have not got time to listen to the whole plot ...
I will make it short.
sorry.  it is your baby now.
I am not good enough to write it alone.  we will have to do it together.
I am all tied up.  i can't.
could not we work in the evenings? six of the clock in the morning? this next month I am completely at your disposal.  artie is out of town.
what has artie to do with it.
we are engaged.
good for you.  you have got yourself the best guy in town.
i think so.  they are on location in arizona, shooting a western. I am free every evening, every week- end.  if you want, we could work at your place.
it is just impossible.
nobody can be that busy.
look, betty, it can not be done. it is out.
you are tough, all right.
you are on your own.  stop being chicken-hearted and write that story.
honest to goodness, i hate you.
and do not make it too dreary.  how about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  he teaches at night.  right?  they do not even know each other, but they share the same room.  it is cheaper that way.  as a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse.
are you kidding? because i think it is good.
so do i.
came  on back.  let me show you where it fits in.
oh, you --
and here's a title: an apple for the teacher.
what is the matter, max?
i just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  it is not miss desmond they want.  it is the car they want to rent.
what?
goodbye, young fellow.  we will see what we can do.
I am not worried.  everything will be fine.  the old team together. nothing can stop us.
how did it go?
it could not have gone better. it is practically set.  of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
he must be quite a guy.
he'a a shrewd old fox.  he can smell box office.  only I am going to outfox him a litt1e.  this is not going to be c. b. demille's salome. it is going to be norma desmond's salome, a norma desmond production, starring norma desmond...home, max.
do not turn around.  keep your eyes on the book.
yes, norma.
i just came to say good night. i do not want you to see me -- I am not very attractive.
good night.
I have lost half a pound since tuesday.
good.
i was a little worried about the line of my throat.  this woman has done wonders with it.
good.
you would better get to bed yourself.
i think I will read a little.
you went out last night, did not you, joe?
why do you say that?
i just happen to know it.  i had a nightmare and i screamed for you.  you were not here.  where were you?
i went for a walk.
no you didn't.  you took the car.
all right, i drove to the beach. norma, you do not want me to feel I am locked up in this house?
of course not, joe.  it is just that i do not want to be left alone. not now, while I am under this terrible strain.  my nerves are being torn apart.  all i ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
i have not done anything, norma.
of course you haven't.  i would not let you.
good.
what is good about it?  i miss him something fierce.
i mean this is good dialogue along in here.  it will play.
it will?
sure.  especially with lots of music underneath, drowning it out.
do not you sometimes hate yourself?
constantly.  no, in all serious- ness, it is really good.  it is fun writing again.  I am happy here, honest i am.
who is norma?
who is who?
I am sorry.  i do not usually read private cigarette cases.
oh, that.  it is from a friend of mine.  a middle-aged lady, very foolish and very generous.
I will say.  this is solid gold.
i gave her some advice on an idiotic script.
it is that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street.  she turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
that is the trouble with you readers.  you know all the plots. now suppose you proof-read page ten while the water boils.
look at this street.  all card- board, all hollow, all phoney. all done with mirrors.  i like it better than any street in the world.  maybe because i used to play here when i was a kid.
what were you -- a child actress?
i was born just two blocks from this studio.  right on lemon grove avenue.  father was head elec- trician here till he died.  mother still works in wardrobe.
second generation, huh?
third.  grandma did stunt work for pearl white.  i come from a picture family.  naturally they took it for granted i was to become a great star.  so i had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. then the studio made a test.  well, they did not like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  i went to a doctor and had it fixed.  they made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they did not like my acting.
nice job.
should be.  it cost three hundred dollars.
saddest thing i ever heard.
not at all.  it taught me a little sense.  i got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the stenographic. now I am a reader...
come clean, betty.  at night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
not once.  what is wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? it is really more fun.
three cheers for betty schaefer! i will now kiss that nose of yours.
if you please.
may i say you smell real special.
it must be my new shampoo.
that is no shampoo.  it'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  how old are you anyway?
twenty-two.
that is it -- there is nothing like being twenty-two.  now may i suggest that if we are ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me ...  now back to the typewriter.
what is it, max? want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours?
you must be very careful as you cross the patio.  madame may be watching.
how about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. will that do it?
I am not inquiring where mr. gillis goes every night...
why do not you? I am writing a script and I am dying to finish it, no matter what.
it is just that I am very worried about madame.
sure you are.  and we are not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  getting herself ready for a pioture ...  what happens when she finds out?
she never will.  that is my job. it has been for a long time.  you must understand i discovered her when she was eighteen.  i made her a star.  i cannot let her be destroyed.
you made her a star?
i directed all her early pictures. there were three young directors who showed promise in those days: d.w. grirrith, c.b. demille, and max von mayerling.
and she is turned you into a servant.
it was i who asked to come back, humiliating as it may seem.  i could have gone on witn my career, only i found everything unendur- able arter she divorced me.  you see, i was her rirst husband.
hey, what is the matter... betty, wake up!  why are you staring at me like that?
was i?  I am sorry.
what is wrong with you tonight? what is it, betty?
something came up.  i do not want to talk about it.
why not?
i just don't.
what is it you have heard.  come on, let's have it.
betty, there is no use running out on it.  let's face it, what- ever it is.
it is nothing.  i got a telegram from artie.
from artie.  what is wrong?
he wants me to come on to arizona. he says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  it would kind of save us a honeymoon.
why do not you? we can finish the script by thursday.
stop crying.  you are getting married.  that is what you have always wanted.
i do not want it now.
why not? do not you love artie?
of course i love him.  i always will.  I am just not in love with him any more.
what happened?
you did.
hello, betty.
i do not know why I am so scared, joe.  is it something awful?
come on in, betty,
ever been in one of these old hollywood palazzos? that is from when they were making eighteen thou- sand a week, and no taxes.  careful of these tiles, they are slippery. valentino used to dance here.
this is where you live?
you bet.
whose house is it?
hers.
whose?
just look around.  there is a lot of her spread about.  if you do not remember the face, you must have heard the name of norma desmond.
that was norma desmond on the phone?
want something to drink?  there is always champagne on ice, and plenty of caviar.
why did she call me?
jealous.  ever see so much junk? she had the ceiling brought from portugal.  look at this.
her own movie theatre.
i did not come here to see a house. what about norma desmond?
I am trying to tell you.  this is an enormous place.  eight master bedrooms.  a sunken tub in every bathroom.  there is a bowling alley in the cellar.  it is lonely here, so she got herself a companion. a very simple set-up: an older woman who is well-to-do.  a younger man who is not doing too well ... can you figure it out yourself?
no.
all right.  I will give you a few more clues.
no, no! i have not heard any of this.  i never got those telephone calls.  I have never been in this house ... get your things together. let's get out of here.
all my things? all the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases?
come on, joe.
come on where? back to a one-room apartment that i can not pay for? back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not?
if you love me, joe.
look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. a long-term contract with no options. i like it that way.  maybe it is not very admirable.  well, you and artie can be admirable.
joe, i can not look at you any more.
nobody asked you to.
what are you doing, joe?  what are you doing?  you are not leaving me?
yes, i am, norma.
no, you are not.  max! max!
max is a good idea.  he can help with my luggage.  thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  and thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
the rest of the jewelry is in the top drawer.
it is yours, joe.  i gave it to you.
and I would take it in a second, norma -- only it is a little too dressy for sitting behind the copy desk in dayton, ohio.
these are nothing.  you can have anything you want if you will only stay.  what is it you want -- money?
norma, you would be throwing it away. i do not qualify for the job, not any more.
you can not do this!  max!  max! ... i can not face life without you, and I am not afraid to die, you know.
that is between you and yourself, norma.
you think i made that up about the gun...
see, you did not believe me!.. now i suppose you do not think i have the courage!
oh.  sure -- if it would make a good scene.
you do not care.  do you?  but hundreds of thousands of people will carel
wake up, norma.  you would be killing yourself to an empty house.  the audience left twenty years ago. now face it.
that is a lie!  they still want me!
no, they don't.
what about the studio? what about de mille?
he was trying to spare your feelings. the studio wanted to rent your car.
wanted what?
de mille did not have the heart to tell you.  none of us has had the heart.
that is a lie!  they want me, they want me!  i get letters every day!
you tell her, max.  come on, do her that favor.  tell her there is not going to be any picture -- there are not any fan letters, except the ones you write yourself.
that is not true! max?
you heard him.  I am a star!
norma, grow up.  you are a woman of fifty.  there is nothing tragic about being fifty - not unless you try to be twenty-five.
I am the greatest star of them all.
goodbye.  norma.
no one leaves a star.  that makes one a star.
you do not deny having killed this man, miss desmond?
did you intend to kill him? just answer me that.
was it a sudden quarrel?  had there been any trouble between you before?
if it was a quarrel, how come you had the gun right there?
this guy -- where did you meet him for the first time?  where did he come from? who is he?
did he have a wife?  did he had a girl friend?  did you know them?
had he been trying to blackmail you?
did the deceased ever threaten you? were you in fear of bodily injury?
did you hate him?  had you ever thought of doing something like this before?
was theft involved?  did you catch him trying to steal something, or find he had stolen something?
cameras? ...what is it, max?
the cameras have arrived, madame.
they have?  thank you, max.  tell mr. demille i will be on the set at once.
well, it is one way to get her down stairs.
okay.  and let's have the car right outside.
what is the scene? where am i?
this is the staircase of the palace.
oh, yes, yes.  they are below, waiting for the princess ... I am ready.
all right.  camera!  action!
