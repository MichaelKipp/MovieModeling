i'm missing two!
shit! temp's dropping! we should have left this rock an hour ago!
yo, teach, what the fuck?
we're missing two of the kids!
get your ass back to the shuttle. i'll check it out.
the air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.
somebody wanted the place to stay hidden.
in twenty-eighty-two many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape . . .
creepy.
cool.
hey teach! this rock's starting to freeze! get your ass back hre!
keep your shirt on! i'm working on it. you won't believe what we found.  adrienne! stoney!
fat lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. call grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!
now wait a minute! i don't think you should open that door.
this is a science excursion corporal. just stay out of the way.
the cryo unit leaked. the computers sealed the room. no airborne viruses no hazardous materials. i've shut down the until. alright, stand back.
hold your breath. initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.
kicker!
defense droids. i'm on it.
leave him behind!
no! he's coming with us!
nice touch.
and you said high school was boring.
oh my god . . . what the hell is . . .
just get us to the ship!
get them in the lab!
not so fast yllo! there's a protocol here.
my god! this is way over your head, pal. we need to call some experts and . . .
i am an expert!
you're a teacher.
brodski i'll talk slow so you can understand me. she's thawing. if we don't get her to the lab, she'll die, and that will be on your bald fucking head!
what if they're carrying? did you even check?
how do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
damnit, yllo! i don't like it.
i don't give a shit. this one's prime for decryonization. we're brining her back.
i still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
i am a scientist you asshole! this could be the most important discovery in 400 years. do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
right now, i care only for the safety of this crew. you don't know anything about these two -
jesus what the hell is that?
that's exactly what we need to find out. check your orders, sergeant. i out rank you where discovery is concerned. now step aside. i have a medical emergency to deal with.
watch it punk, i'm armed.
punk?
this is what it means right here.
small brains make your balls itch?
and what's with the headgear?
the mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve.
now what?
we wait. i need about fifteen. call me if there are any changes. if she farts i want a full report.
you're quicker than usual.
later.
you prefer an apple?
you son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
we just left old earth. you'll never believe what we found.
i'm sending you the files.
yeah, yeah if this is another ancient farrari . . .
trust me. i'm bypassing regular channels. see what kind of payday we're looking at.
alright, i'm . . .  no way . . . is this a joke?
hypothetically, how much are we talking?
if you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. doesn't include touring and guest lectures. when can you get them here?
i'll reset our course . . . 3 hours?
see you then . . . doctor.
it's time.
what about the others? shouldn't we wait?
i've waited long enough. kay . . . you know what to do.
what the hell are you doing?
my job.
fine, just stay out of my way.  hit it.
spunky . . .
she broke my fucking nose!
where..? who . . .?  i'm alive. you brought me back.
obviously so.
how did i get here, how did you bring me back?
nanotechnology.
nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
we've had nano-tech for the last 30 years.
30? how long was i out?
now lay back we need to do some tests and i have some questions...
jason?! where is he?!
the hockey player? he a friend of yours?
hockey player? he's not a ...
he's dead! everyone's dead! old earth is dead!
old earth?
we need to do some tests...i'd like to ask you a few questions.
but...i...400 years?
that's right, now if you could...
wait a minute...i need...
give it a rest yllo. she needs some time.
well?
she needs a little time.
more time...shit, she's had 400 years...
that's really funny.
i'd want her statements before we reach porch. jesus, women.
yeah, like you'd be a rock after everything she went through?
jason? he's on this ship?!
of course he is. he's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. look if you're worried about pr don't be. you're walking and talking.  he's a stiff. you'll get the publicity.
are you finished?
god damnit! will you stop doing that?!
oh i like her a lot.
i'm with you kid.
where is he?
lab two, relax. what's the matter? he's dead.
no, you're dead! you're all dead!
jesus!
oh my god! adrienne?
what have you done?
what have i done?! idiots.
brodski! get to lab two. we have an emergency!
er, guys. where's the hockey player?
i'll tell you where he is. he's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
maybe she tripped.
jesus, god!
oh man, what the hell happened?
jason! can't you see? he did this.
impossible! he was dead before he entered cryo-statis. there is no possible way he could be alive.
i didn't say he was alive.
that's nine to four, geek-boy.
you got lucky.
you got lucky. i could have waited until he ate your head.
speaking of which, duck!
that sucks. why won't he go down?
pause play.
he's not part of the program.
hey cool. they brought ancient hockey guy back to life.
asshole that does not count as a kill.
yes it does.
oh, come on!
okay, enough of this shit.
alright, asshole.
i don't have all day, kid.
yeah yeah i better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
azrael can you repeat that?
get him out of there!
he's dead. they're both dead. you don't understand what is on this ship. this is a being that kills. that's what he does. that's all he does. and he is very good at it.
kicker, sven. get into the grid and tell me what the hell is going on!
where are you going?
we have to get off this ship.
that's ridiculous. you're overreacting.
why don't you get it? he's going to kill us all!
i doubt that. i think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
look! just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! that's the only way you're going to live.
you just need to relax. rizzo ti's the future. we have soldiers on board, e-x grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? i'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
i hope so.
report to weapons. we're going on a hunt.
roger that.  time to kick some ass!
yllo, what's your head count?
looks like we're missing two. stone and kkinsa.
i need to know what you know about this guy.
don't go out there. you can't win. we need to get off this ship. that's all there is to it.
not an option. i'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down.
all i'm saying is dock with space lab, couple of hours no more. let them take a look at our friends.
not a chance.
just don't go in there half cocked. you guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later.
you got that right.
you sumbitch! three dead! on my watch! if that...that thing is out there, it's dead! you got it!!!
fuckin a...
now get out of our way...get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... we've got a job to do!
robot huh?
kay-em 14.
barbie from hell...
cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six...
yeah 3cpo, i saw star wars, now how about you help me get out of this coffin, barbie...
i'm afraid i cannot assist.
i'm surrounded by idiots.
you need to get laid!
got it! let's move out girls. yllo go to lab two and cover out backs.
at least try to get him alive...will ya brodski?
yeah, i got ya. i don't see anything inside though.
you just keep an eye out.
yeah yeah. got it.
kicker, anything?
negative.
so, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? they could hack him to pieces?
exactly.
you see that?
briggs, geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
jesus, sarge, what is this thing?
teach! where the hell are you?! where's our visuals?!!
fat lou, we're changing courses for the solaras space lab.
i'll need the sergeant's okay on that.
we've got a situation here! just do as  you're told!
alright, relax. 20 minutes. soon as we've passed tara's rings we'll make the course correction.
thank you.
ok sarge, what's your status?
what's my status?! i've lost three men and your worthless fuck! after i kill this asshole i'm coming your yllo!
but i didn't see...
yes!
listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing.
duck fuckers?
he's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. okay, you know , that's it for me. i'm outta here.
outta here?
isn't there an escape pod on this ship? something?
sergeant!
what?
i don't understand...what does he want?
he wants to kill you...and me...and everyone on this ship.
you're not going anywhere.
you wanna die?
are we locked down?
what good will that do?
they can deal with this sort of thing.
more soldiers?
scientists. very intellegent men.
that's great. i bet they'll kick jason's ass at a spelling bee!
look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
try to calm down. just think, you're going to be famous!
guys, please come with me!
4you're not going anywhere.
now hold on! we should hear her out!
she's obviously dealt with this guy before.
shut up! she just wants this thing dead!
no shit. i got no problem with that.
listen to me. please. let's get off thsi ship. come with me.
rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? we'll die oout there.
how do you open the damn door?
you're crazy!
rizzo, he's out there.
yeah and he'll be here soon enough.  last chance.
what are you doing?
jesus! can't you knock?  diminish power to shutttle beowulf.
what?
ssh.
how do you know?
i just know.
we must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey.
i'm thinking rizzo was right.
thinking with your dick again, delongpre?
maybe we should go with them. like you said, your space lab connections can deal with this thing. at least we'll be safe.
they are not going anywhere. i cut power to the  shuttle.
something's wrong.
keep trying!
yuck.
we're screwed.
the power's back up!
then open the doors!
thirty seconds.
what do we do?!!
crutch?
it's okay, he just wanted his machete.
three...two...one...
now that's just gross.
go, go, go!
go-go-go-go-go!!!!
he's right behind us!
damn!  close the door! i'll be right back.
what?!!
i gotta go back.
but?!!
better let me.
where'd you get the gun?
forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
what do you mean, not enough time?
well, i'm not hanging out here with ms. showtunes.
guys!!! the shuttle?
i feel better. now how do you fire this damn thing?
just go! i've a feeling he's right behind us!
don't just stand there! shoot him!
no you don't!
uh-oh.
what?!
kkinsa! open the doors!
kkinsa, open the goddamn door!
yeah, that's it, scare the hell out of here, that'll work.
kkinsa, crutch is hurt! we need access to the shuttle's med-kit or he'll die.
med-kit?
i guessed.
i didn't say i was good at it.
oh shit! there he is!
we're screwed!
400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
just make a break for the door. he'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
we're not leaving crutch!
we don't have time to argue!
everyone okay?
i think i broke my arm.
goodbye old friend.
okay, he was a great guy, now let's move out.
could you show a little compassion?!
push off toward us.
forget her, she's a pain in the ass. let her hang there.
i'm gonna spew.
that ought'a help the situation.
what if you miss?
what if we don't?
okay that hurt.
thorgan, pull us in.
you think it killed . . .  yeah, i guess not.
let's just get out of here.
shit!
the hull's imploding!
rizzo! can you hear me?!
it's locked!
then break it! if you don't pull it, the ship's going to depressurize!
what are you doing?!!
if the ship goes, so does jaso.
rizzo pull the fucking lever!
no.
rizzo?!
it's better this way. if we were rescued jason would just get off the ship. you want him on your precious earth ii?
hurry! she's lost it!
so what else is new?
boeman don't. you know i'm right.
are you crazy?! pull the lever!
what's that?
that's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
no...  that's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
are there any other shuttles?
no.
teleportation? some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
you read a lot of science fiction didn't you?
a little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
i'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a knofflapod. damn.
am i in there?
sory...
hey.
that's a good fantasy, though. kinky, but good.
hey!!
what's this?
it's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
can we get through these?
sure but what good will that do?
when the left hull goes, so will the right.
what if we blow the walkways first? leave jason over here to go up with the ship?
any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental.
i'm just saying.
come on. you got all these gadgets and shit. why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways?
we'd need charges.
we could convert fission transistors.
we're not supposed to do that.
what are you gonna do, tell me?
yeah, great idea! and i'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job.
would you?
now this is getting exciting.
remember to roll his balls around a bit.
i'll need system four converters.
they're back here.
how many?
bring 'em all. let's move!
hey! i'm not ready.
then you better hurry. i'll blow alley one, delongpre, you and rizzo take there. janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
you're so bossy.
you're leaving me here alone?
it's just you and me, then.
come here, might as well fix that arm.
i think i speak on behalf of the group when i say this is bad news.
thorgan? you coming?!
almost done.
ow!
oh, hush. i disengaged your pain programming.
sometimes i just wish i had a kitten.
that's why i'm here.
so, you thought you'd be cool. go against your father's wishes? yeah, that's grown up.
my father's company imports and exports. archaeology is part of the business. we happen to get along just fine, smartass. look, why don't you bust somebody else's balls for a change.
i thought you meant...
you thought i meant...too tough to apologize, huh? you must have been a very lonely girl.
sorry, sorry.
who are you apologizing to?
good point.
jason seemed to have the right stuff. physically, anyway. radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. he just kept going.
were you close to your father?
it's on the table where i left it! what the hell are you doing?! hurry up!
i'm on my way.
thorgan, quit screwing around and come on!
i'm coming, i'm coming.
they were all wrong. they couldn't control him.
and what happend to ...?
i couldn't save them.
well, we'd be dead without you. you know that, don't you?
where is everybody? what happened?
damnit! you scared the hell out of me!
give me a break! what happened?
jason. he's what happened. then grendel hit space lab.
space lab?! wait'll i get my hands on yllo.
yllo's dead. we...we thought you were too.
takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down.
where is...?
you tell me! she's only set one charge. and it's not finished!
where have you been?!!
he....he...
we can't lead him into the other hull!
we don't have a choice!
do i have to?
yes, i've reprogrammed you. you are very brave. bad ass.
oh, alright.
where the hell were you?!!
he came for me, i had to run!
kay-em, you okay?
don't worry about me. i live for this shit.
i'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
then stop talking and work faster!
i...i don't know what i did...
you lost the charge?
he was chasing me!
can we blow it with just two?
if we don't sever the hull completely she'll drag us down with her.
then what do we do?!
i don't know!
damnit to hell, you left me back there to die!
sergeant? we thought you were...
yeah, yeah.  well, what have you got to say for yourself?
i don't know...sorry?
sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
bomb?
explosive. we're blowing the walkway.
blowing the walkway? you come up with that yourself?
rizzo did.
kay-em!
what are you doing back?!!
sumbitch won't be giving us anymore trouble.
you killed him?
blew half his skull away, one leg, one arm and left his entrails stretched across the lab. and look at me! i'm covered in his filthy blood!
you did good, kay-em. i'm proud of you.
a real mamma's boy that one. dissed his mamma and he nearly threw a tantrum. little good it did him.
his mother?
what?
i don't know. nothing.
as long as they're connected we can blow them all simultaneously from a safe distance.
two more charges to go.
done!
let's move out!
hurry!
faster! don't we have another gun?
they're not gonna make it. close the door before he gets us all.
they'll make it.
close the fucking door!
no!
minimal.
we made it?
kay-em we made it!
oh, goody. i'm so pleased. i'd clap if i could.
see? we're not so bad.
not so bad.
pull me in!
i'm pulling, damnit!
we need weapons.
weapons? all this technology and what good has it done?!
it bought us some time.
and now we're all out of it.
the ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. when it  reaches the core, we're done.
done?
kaboom.
again?! jesus!
you must shut down the engines.
then do it. the rescue ship can find us here right?
can't shut em' down from here.
somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room.
you know, this future shit sucks. i'll fucking do it.
you?
wait around on your asses all day.  i'll need a distraction.
hurry up, guys. we've got the rescue ship on radar.
delongpre! out of time!
guys, he's right behind us!
it's okay.
okay?!!
just come on, i've got an idea.
got it.  you ever space walked?
oh sure, all the time.
earth ii.
suit up.
i'll help you in.
kay-em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you?
i knew you were a little sick, but geez.
i get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but i get a kick out of you.
goodbye, my love.
thorgan, suit up.
this is gonna work. if he sticks to the program. will he? stick to the program?
his mother was killed before his eyes. that's what drove him insane. it'll work.
that sounds like rizzo having faith in some of that future shit.
eat me.
oh, shit. he's going to see us.
well, do something!
sergeant!
get out of here!
boeman, the ships not here.
use the thrusters and you'll be fine. we'll huddle together out there.
hey, easy now.
you wanna release your air tanks?
okay, good tip.
you'll be fine.
remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. we'll be fine.
why wouldn't we be. i mean, look around. so far so good.
rizzo, you okay?
no i'm not okay! i don't know what the hell i'm doing!
you're doing fine. i won't let anything happen to you, remember?
rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time?
i think i had some when i was eight.
did you like it?
i think so, why?
he's trying to ask you out on a date.
shut up, thorgan!
delongpre, you don't even know me.
i know you.
rizzo, pull away!
i'm stuck!
you okay?!
oh great...yeah, having a great time, and you?
no thank you, you crazy old woman.
old woman?
well i mean, technically you are old enough to be my great, great, great...
i get it.
kay-em you okay?
i am now. i missed you, thorgan.
i missed you too.
i love you.
