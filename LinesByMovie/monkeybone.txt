you want to leave? but stu - you are a big hit! everyone loves you!
they do not love me. they love monkeybone.
it was you who got the standing o. it was you drawing on the belly over there...
that was especially monkeybone. come on, doc, i do not want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. i just want to be us. home. alone! <i></i> i have something i have to give you.
can not you give it to me later?
yeah, i could, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
sorry, julie - will not be a minute. now stu - i know you do not like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -
julie and i - we were just gonna go...
go? there is a potload of money here, pal. you got three major toy companies...you got the guys from burger god over here...
burger god. the ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
never proven. they are ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. kids love burger god -
herb, it is too much. it is all out of hand.
do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? you got to strike. I am talking mansions. lamborghinis. champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
i do not want to be rich. it is just a trap!
being rich is not a trap. that is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
herb. i have to go.
why?
i got the ring. <i></i> tonight's the night, herb. tonight's the night.
oh my god...you're proposing?
my life was totally crappy, herb, and she... fixed it. she made me happy. which I would never been. she loves me the way i am - right now. <i></i> i do not want everything to change. i do not want her saying yes to some big success. i just want her saying yes to me.
...in some weird way i respect that.
look at this! he will not let us leave!
who?
the monkey!! he is everywhere! he will take over both our lives if we let him.
stu - stop it. that monkey is good luck. you thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he is probably going to make you rich. so relax! enjoy it!
I am trying. it is weird, that is all. i never had any good luck, until i met you...what if it is all just another bad dream?
what is the "bad" part?
i might wake up.
<i></i> if you do, I will be right there beside you. so face it. you are just going to have to be happy!
i am happy. it just so happens this is the happiest night of my life.
did we just - hit something?
i do not think so.
are you okay??
I am fine, baby. we are all okay. we were lucky.
I would better go report this...
chasing me - animals - horrible -
animals? what kind of animals?
yeah, i know - picasso. guernica, right? that is what everybody says - although personally, i do not see the resemblance. what are you drinking?
uhh - martini?
olive or eyeball?
olive. - where exactly am i?
dark town. land of nightmares. I am bull.
stu miley.
yeah, I have seen a few of your dreams. you are quite a celebrity down here.
jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
sad commentary, huh?
<i></i> i beg your pardon?
i did not say anything.
i was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
yo, jumbo. we got us some kind of ventriloquist here.
now do not pick a fight. I am staying over.
oh, poor buster. he has not been fed in a day and a half. let me get some food...
special occasion?
i do not know. i guess it was...
who did this?
stu. that was right about the time we met.
when he first came in to the sleep lab?
yeah...before your time.
jesus, honey...he always joked about you curing him, but i never realized what you cured him from.
he had not gotten a good night's sleep in years. the nightmares would wake him up, and he would start right in painting... <i></i> that boy looked like pluperfect hell.
how do you get from here - to there?
switch hands.
what?
I am serious. it was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. he was a rightie, so i made him switch the pencil to his left hand. just to see what did come out.
monkeybone?
left-handed, he was funny. he would been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> and then the nightmares just...stopped.
wow - two guys in the same brain. - which one did you fall in love with?
oh, julie...my poor stu...my poor baby brother...
when'd you get in?
an hour ago. <i></i> i tried to prepare myself, but i did not know he would be like, like this. i can not even bear to look at him... how about you? you are okay?
I am fine, kimmy. fine.
i had so much i always wanted to say to him. at least he had a chance to give you the ring.
the ring...
grandmama's ring. the engagement ring. he asked me to send it to him -
vital signs have stabilized. that is good.
can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
he is held on this far. we can not do much but wait and see.
but these...machines are what is keeping him alive, is that right?
at the moment, yes.
can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
comas are unpredictable. he could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
honey, i have to clarify this. the thing is, dr. edelstein, my brother has an absolute horror of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
kimmy, he does not know what is going on. he does not even know he is in a -
please, julie. this is not easy for me. our father took a long time to die. a long time. it just about killed us all. and stu and i made a pact that when our time came - we would not let it drag out.
it is too soon even to - talk about that!
give me a date, doctor.
three months. <i></i> there is always some brain damage. but at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
i want him to have every chance, doctor. we can certainly give it...three months.
hey, stu, why so glum? everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
three months, bull. three months tonight. three months since the accident - and I am no closer to going home than i was then.
aw, buck up. have another 'tini.
I am sick of martinis. I am sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's nightmares. and of course, i need not add -
you have humiliated me in public for the last time.
i doubt that. besides, i can not help myself. I am just a figment of your imagination.
then you can learn to act normally. i had to!
aw, come on. you know you love me. you are a masochistic pain freak. you gotta love me.
i am not. and i do not gotta.
you are too! mooning over julie when we could both be gettin' some o' this fine local action. it is not like she is going to know. out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma do not count.
sorry. the women here are not my type. most of them are not even my species.
nothing for him! he is being repressed.
is something wrong, stu? you seem so tense.
aaah, it is the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
I have been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what is his name?
hypnos?
yeah. to see if he could expedite my case. but i wait, and i wait, and...i'm starting to think I will never see her again.
my fellow americans. i have a dream. let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
<i></i> I am sorry, kitty - what were you saying?
come on, pal! it was a compliment! you'da done the same if you had the equipment!
that does it! back in the pack!
forget it! no way! I am not getting -
I am reportin' this to my union!!
what union?
the sidekicks' union! me, tonto, and robin the boy wonder. you top bananas better watch your ass!
i left my phone number in your undies. try not to lose it in traffic.
sorry, kitty! I will be right back after i choke my monkey.
he is ninety. he is practically dead already. how come he goes back and i stay here?
maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
<i></i> hey!! hey, you!!
he got an e-ticket. where is mine? when do i get to wake up??
stu? stu? let's not disturb the nice reaper.
I have been stuck down here for months. somebody had better start paying attention, or I am going to - I am going to kick ass!
let's not kick the nice reaper's ass.
kimmy! what is the matter?
this is hard for me, julie...very hard...but it is been three months now, and... <i></i> i gave the order.
y'call that art? why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
like you would know. you started out on the back of a napkin, you little...doodle.
how did you get in there?
stu... it is a party.
mr. hypnos - sir - i needed to talk to you -
wait a minute. stu miley, right? boys and girls ...mr. stu miley, in the house! <i></i> this is an honor. we see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like caviar, man. you da shits!!
mr. hypnos, i saw a dream. my girlfriend was having it. she dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. she was watching me die.
uh huh. and?
well, i have to get a message to her. i have to let her know I am okay. until i can get out of here...
kid - did not they tell you about this party?
tell me what?
it is a special kind of party. a farewell party. do you...get what I am saying?
farewell? you mean - you mean I am -
i think i...i'm about to... am i mistaken, or do not i get to... is there some...
y'see, stu, as i understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
pact? pact? no life support??
well - yeah - but that doesn't...apply. it was different then. i was depressed. my life is great now. I am in love!
besides, julie wouldn't...she'd never...
actually, stu, julie does not get to decide. that is why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> they are pulling the plug at nine am.
nine am! but that is - twelve hours.
I am so dumb! i deserve to die -
mr. hypnos, you run this place. I am begging you. there is got to be something i can do.
stu, i like you personally, i admire your work, but I am just the god of sleep. this is death's bailiwick.
maybe you could talk to death!
me? me, go crawling to death? my friend, it will be a cold, cold day in las vegas, nevada, before i go crawling to that piece of -
now death is not what you would call a people person, like me. death is a putz - and i should know. I am his little brother.
you are death's brother?
oh yeah. mr. by-the-book, stick-up-the-ass, my- way-or-the-highway death. believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of that schtick. <i></i> so i need a job. he sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I am supposed to be grateful?
guys, i do not mean to be rude, but i only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
oh, right. cheating death. there is one thing you might try. only one guy in history ever pulled it off. well, actually two. actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, very few people have done it.
hyp, I will do anything.
land of death. how do i get there?
kid, listen: that's all I am saying. and you did not hear it from me.
fate worse than death! well, it is been real, boss, but i got to go buff up my resum. anybody here need a figment?
fine! do not put yourself out. I will go to the land of death alone.
stu, you have my absolute confidence. - dead man! dead man walking!!
<i></i> I have got one chance to get back to julie, and I am going to take it - with or without you.
hey. are not you going to talk me into it?
no. goodbye. thanks for nothing.
you got to talk me into it. you will screw up on your own. i mean, a guy's got to have a sidekick. for moral support! wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> it is the land of death, stu, the land of death! do not go in there without your comedy relief!!
all right. you can come.
oh, thank you! thank you! th-- <i></i> something went very, very wrong here.
now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
he is taking her to the land of death, right? so all we have got to do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> stop shaking! I will protect you.
oh, sure. mr. action hero! why could not i be arnold schwarzenegger's figment?
where did he go??
i do not know.
holy shit.
he is stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> anybody here know what oneirix is?
no. i want to give him more. i want to give him a massive dose.
that is not going to stop his nightmare -
i do not want to stop the nightmare, hutch. i want to crank it up. i want to take it right off the charts. i want to scare him awake.
you know, julie, even if this works - which it probably will not - that stuff is tricky. you do not know what it will do to his brain.
what will it do if they pull the plug?
stu...stu...
it is not working.
there is a thing here! there is a switch!
stu...look!
what?
is not that lulu?
what is the maximum safe dose?
most we have ever used is half a cc.
five cc's.
you saved my life, monkeybone. i never would have made it without you.
move it. we got exactly five minutes left.
it is just...now that I am leaving, i feel like there is lots of things i have not said. who is going to look out for you? are you going to be okay when I am gone?
oh, do not you worry. I will be fine.
you have been a hell of a figment, pal. i sure wish i could take you home with me.
awwww. worried about my feelings, are you? well, there is a new twist.
do not joke around, little buddy. i mean it. i really do love y--
no! do not you understand?? he is got my e-ticket! he is got my -
sorry, stu. it is all part of the deal. we have got big plans for that body of yours!
stu?
julie?... hey, you are a looker.
sorry, steve, maybe next time. and how is our new guest settling in - ?
you set me up!!
easy, pal! i was coming to congratulate you. it am not easy snatching one of those e-tickets. steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
why did you do it? what did i ever do to you?!?
it is simple, stu. we need nightmares - lots of 'em. so whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a nightmare maker! like steve here. poe. rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to atilla and genghis khan!
but why me? why did you pick on me??
the monkey, of course. it was his idea.
monkeybone...!?
nobody wants to be a sidekick, stu. so one day he comes to us - he is got a proposition. we help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
you are nuts! I am a comic strip artist! what is he going to do - draw really scary cartoons??
oh, no, no, no. y'see, stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. and she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice!
oh, baby, i can not believe you are back.
home sweet home, huh? actually, i was expecting something a little swankier. how much loot does old stu rake in, anyway?
meaning me, of course. I am referring to myself. you have to assume monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...
baby? why do not you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I will be right back.
bitchin' good cake.
stu, are you...feeling okay?
sure. why?
you are acting kind of...odd.
<i></i> in what way?
what are you watching?
ohhh, nothing.
you sure this is...medically advisable?
got a doctor on duty.
well. as long as it is okay with monkeybone -
how was it? i do not recall.
it was great, baby. let's get you to the er.
I am so sorry, stu. i wanted to tell you what was going on. i really, really liked you.
kitty...my situation is really not important. the thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
you are such a beautiful man. look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
listen to me! is there any way i can warn her what monkeybone is up to??
priceless! priceless! this stuff just kills me!
I am heading in to work, baby. are you sure you will be okay?
oh yeah. there is just one thing i do not get. "monkeybone creator awakens from coma" that is a big story! that is front page news! but i can not find a word of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> hey. do not i have a tv show?
they only made the one episode. they have shown it about nineteen times.
i need a new pr guy.
and speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy miss julie mcelroy.
i had to park two blocks away. is something -
what is this about merchandising? you always hated merchandising!
well, baby, i do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a potload of money here.
stu? is that you? where did you go?
me? nowhere. i was asleep.
baby, do not lie. i know you went out.
not me. nope. you must have been dreaming.
you are wearing a topcoat, stu. - where are your pants?
well, miss smarty, if i did not go out, i would not need any pants. now would i?
what is the matter?
i think it is a pig hair. <i></i> how much is mcdonald's offering?
less.
oh, here's something. the city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. they wonder if you would be willing to appear at a benefit.
how much?
well, nothing. it is a benefit. but we could probably get people and entertainment tonight to cover it.
i get it. we could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. brilliant!!
and last...you remember bill here, from the bazoom toy company? he is got a little something i think you will like.
so here's my idea. we do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. we get a big piata. we fill it with monkeybone dolls - hundreds of 'em.
a piata. that is a great idea!
the thing is, I am responsible for the way he is acting. it is the nightmare juice. it is got to be.
julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
i can not explain this, alice, but I am not so sure it did. it is as if...he's not stu any more. the stu i love is gone! <i></i> he spends all his time in the garage. he says he's...autographing.
do not ask where i got it.
you can not do this! you will get in trouble!
you are the only true-hearted man i ever met. you find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
how am i gonna get past the guards?
i'll worry about the guards. <i></i> okay, stu. see you in a day or two.
go. just go.
thanks, kitty, I will never forget you for th--
"4/17: subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet."
they had a case like that at johns hopkins. wires got crossed between hands and feet.
you are really going to pop the question?
got the ring. got the airline tickets. soon as they break that piata, we will grab a cab - and it is off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
i can not believe you. you used to hate being the center of attention. now you are proposing, in public, at a benefit.
yeah, i was thinking...i mean, I am a celebrity now, do i really want to get married? but on the other hand, if you are married, they can not testify against you.
the nightmare juice! it is gone! somebody switched it for a beaker of grape kool-aid!!
kool-aid!? but who would would want to -
you are mad at me. great. you have every right to be. but we are both mad at dark town. we are both mad at hypnos.
oh, sure. now you are going to tell me it was all his idea. you were completely innocent -
I am not going to tell you that. i wanted that e- ticket. i wanted it so bad I would stare you right in the face to get it - and I would do the same again.
why??
i have a girl up there. and i never - i should have - i just want to tell her i love her.
I am a simple man. I am just doing my job. i enjoy my job. why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is so irresponsible.
death, I am trying to make things right. take my soul. turn me into a paper doll. but give me just one lousy hour.
well - you would need a body.
if it was not for that comic strip of yours, i would not be doing this. but a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> that one where monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - i thought i would die.
coming from you, that is quite a compliment.
<i>de nada</i>. now, come here...bend over...before i change my mind.
bend over?
we will hop a plane tonight. an island ceremony. an abba dabba honeymoon!
it looks so...new.
it is new. why would not it be new?
but the heirloom ring. your grandmother's ring...
heirloom? huh? you want a used ring - ?
boy, the nuts are out tonight. what did that creep call you - ?
he called me "doc."
death!!
i dress up when i want to make an impression. - so how did it go?
fine, thanks. saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's going to be okay. <i></i> i guess I am yours now.
hey. where is monkeybone?
back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> no offense, stu, but on your own you are kinda vanilla. i did not want to send you back without him.
back? you are sending me back?
it is irregular, but...i just love that strip of yours. i figure I will take the "family circus" guy instead.
death! thank you!
thank me next time you see me.
oh, stu. tell me I am not dreaming.
baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
what is the matter?
my tail itches.
