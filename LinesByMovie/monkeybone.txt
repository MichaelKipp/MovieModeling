you want to leave? but stu - you're a big hit! everyone loves you!
they don't love me. they love monkeybone.
it was you who got the standing o. it was you drawing on the belly over there...
that was <u>especially</u> monkeybone. come on, doc, i don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. i just want to be <u>us</u>. home. alone! <i></i> i have something i have to give you.
can't you give it to me later?
yeah, i <u>could</u>, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
sorry, julie - won't be a minute. now stu - i know you don't like the idea, but you really ought to talk to these guys -
julie and i - we were just gonna go...
go? there's a potload of money here, pal. you got three major toy companies...you got the guys from burger god over here...
burger god. the ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
never proven. they're ready to pop for a pre- emptive endorsement. kids love burger god -
herb, it's too much. it's all out of hand.
do you know what kind of opportunity you have here? you gotta <u>strike</u>. i'm talking mansions. lamborghinis. champagne for mouthwash when you brush your teeth!
i don't want to be rich. it's just a trap!
being rich is <u>not a trap</u>. that is a dirty lie perpetuated by rich people to keep the failures from killing them.
herb. <u>i have to go</u>.
why?
i got the ring. <i></i> tonight's the night, herb. tonight's the night.
oh my god...you're proposing?
my life was totally crappy, herb, and she... fixed it. she made me happy. which i'd never been. she loves me the way i am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> i don't want everything to change. i don't want her saying yes to some big success. i just want her saying yes to me.
...in some weird way i respect that.
look at this! he won't let us leave!
who?
the monkey!! he's everywhere! he'll take over both our lives if we let him.
stu - stop it. that monkey is <u>good luck</u>. you thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. so relax! enjoy it!
i'm trying. it's weird, that's all. i never had any good luck, until i met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
what's the "bad" part?
i might wake up.
<i></i> if you do, i'll be right there beside you. so face it. you're just going to have to be happy!
i am happy. it just so happens this is the happiest night of my life.
did we just - <u>hit</u> something?
i don't think so.
are you okay??
i'm fine, baby. we're all okay. we were lucky.
i'd better go report this...
chasing me - animals - horrible -
animals? what <u>kind</u> of animals?
yeah, i know - picasso. <u>guernica</u>, right? that's what everybody says - although personally, i don't see the resemblance. what are you drinking?
uhh - martini?
olive or eyeball?
olive. - where exactly am i?
dark town. land of nightmares. i'm bull.
stu miley.
yeah, i've seen a few of your dreams. you're quite a celebrity down here.
jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
sad commentary, huh?
<i></i> i beg your pardon?
i didn't say anything.
i was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
yo, jumbo. we got us some kind of <u>ventriloquist</u> here.
now don't pick a fight. i'm staying over.
oh, poor buster. he hasn't been fed in a day and a half. let me get some food...
special occasion?
i don't know. i guess it was...
who did this?
stu. that was right about the time we met.
when he first came in to the sleep lab?
yeah...before your time.
jesus, honey...he always joked about you <u>curing</u> him, but i never realized what you cured him <u>from</u>.
he hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. the nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> that boy looked like pluperfect hell.
how do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
switch hands.
what?
i'm serious. it was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. he was a rightie, so i made him switch the pencil to his left hand. just to see what'd come out.
monkeybone?
left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. he'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> and then the nightmares just...stopped.
wow - two guys in the same brain. - which one did you fall in love with?
oh, julie...my poor stu...my poor baby brother...
when'd you get in?
an hour ago. <i></i> i tried to prepare myself, but i didn't know he would be like, like <u>this</u>. i can't even bear to look at him... how about you? you're okay?
i'm fine, kimmy. fine.
i had so much i always wanted to say to him. at least he had a chance to give you the ring.
the ring...
grandmama's ring. the <u>engagement</u> ring. he asked me to send it to him -
vital signs have stabilized. that's good.
can you give us a realistic sense of my brother's chances?
he's held on this far. we can't do much but wait and see.
but these...machines are what's keeping him alive, is that right?
at the moment, yes.
can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
comas are unpredictable. he could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
honey, i have to clarify this. the thing is, dr. edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. he doesn't even know he's in a -
please, julie. this is not easy for me. our father took a <u>long</u> time to die. a long time. it just about killed us all. and stu and i made a pact that when our time came - we wouldn't let it drag out.
it's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
give me a date, doctor.
three months. <i></i> there's always some brain damage. but at three months...the chances of coming back shrink dramatically with every day.
i want him to have every chance, doctor. we can certainly give it...three months.
hey, stu, why so glum? everybody loves a good humiliation nightmare.
three months, bull. three months tonight. three months since the accident - and i'm no closer to going home than i was then.
aw, buck up. have another 'tini.
i'm sick of martinis. i'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's <u>nightmares</u>. and of course, i need not <u>add</u> -
<u>you</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
i doubt that. besides, i can't help myself. i'm just a figment of your imagination.
then you can learn to act normally. i had to!
aw, come on. you know you love me. you're a masochistic pain freak. you <u>gotta</u> love me.
i am not. and i don't gotta.
you are too! mooning over julie when we could <u>both</u> be gettin' some o' this fine local action. it's not like she's gonna know. out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't <u>count</u>.
sorry. the women here aren't my type. most of them aren't even my <u>species</u>.
nothing for him! he's being repressed.
is something wrong, stu? you seem so tense.
aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
i've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
hypnos?
yeah. to see if he could expedite my case. but i wait, and i wait, and...i'm starting to think i'll never see her again.
my fellow americans. i have a dream. let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
<i></i> i'm sorry, kitty - what were you saying?
come on, pal! it was a compliment! you'da done the same if you had the equipment!
that does it! back in the pack!
forget it! no way! i'm not getting -
i'm reportin' this to my union!!
<u>what</u> union?
the sidekicks' union! me, tonto, and robin the boy wonder. you top bananas better <u>watch your</u> <u>ass</u>!
i left my phone number in your undies. try not to lose it in traffic.
sorry, kitty! i'll be right back after i choke my monkey.
he's ninety. he's practically dead already. how come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>i</u> stay here?
maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
<i></i> hey!! hey, you!!
<u>he</u> got an e-ticket. where's mine? <u>when do i get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
stu? stu? let's not disturb the nice reaper.
i've been stuck down here for <u>months</u>. somebody had better start paying attention, or i'm gonna - i'm gonna <u>kick ass</u>!
let's not kick the nice reaper's ass.
kimmy! what's the matter?
this is hard for me, julie...very hard...but it's been three months now, and... <i></i> i gave the order.
y'call that art? why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
like you'd know. you started out on the back of a napkin, you little...<u>doodle</u>.
how'd <u>you</u> get in there?
stu... it's a <u>party</u>.
mr. hypnos - sir - i needed to talk to you -
wait a minute. stu miley, right? boys and girls ...mr. stu miley, in the <u>house</u>! <i></i> this is an <u>honor</u>. we see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like <u>caviar</u>, man. you da <u>shits</u>!!
mr. hypnos, i saw a dream. my girlfriend was having it. she dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. she was watching me <u>die</u>.
uh huh. and?
well, i have to get a message to her. i have to let her know i'm <u>okay</u>. until i can get out of here...
kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
tell me what?
it's a special kind of party. a <u>farewell</u> party. do you...get what i'm saying?
farewell? you mean - you mean i'm -
i think i...i'm about to... am i mistaken, or don't i get to... is there some...
y'see, stu, as i understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
pact? pact? no life support??
well - yeah - but that doesn't...<u>apply</u>. it was different then. i was <u>depressed</u>. my life is great now. i'm in love!
besides, julie wouldn't...she'd never...
actually, stu, julie doesn't get to decide. that's why she was having the nightmare. <i></i> they're pulling the plug at nine am.
nine am! but that's - <u>twelve hours</u>.
i'm so dumb! i <u>deserve</u> to die -
mr. hypnos, you run this place. i'm begging you. there's gotta be something i can do.
stu, i like you personally, i admire your work, but i'm just the god of sleep. this is death's bailiwick.
maybe you could talk to death!
me? <u>me</u>, go crawling to death? my friend, it will be a cold, cold day in las vegas, nevada, before i go crawling to <u>that</u> piece of -
now death is not what you would call a people person, like me. death is a <u>putz</u> - and i should know. i'm his little brother.
you're death's <u>brother</u>?
oh yeah. mr. by-the-book, stick-up-the-ass, my- way-or-the-highway death. believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of <u>that</u> schtick. <i></i> so i need a job. he sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. i'm supposed to be <u>grateful</u>?
guys, i don't mean to be rude, but i only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
oh, right. cheating death. there's <u>one thing</u> you might try. only one guy in <u>history</u> ever pulled it off. well, actually two. actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, <u>very few people</u> have done it.
hyp, i'll do anything.
land of death. how do i get there?
kid, listen: <u>that's all i'm saying</u>. and you didn't hear it from me.
fate worse than death! well, it's been real, boss, but i gotta go buff up my resum. anybody here need a figment?
fine! don't put yourself out. i'll go to the land of death alone.
stu, you have my <u>absolute confidence</u>. - dead man! dead man walking!!
<i></i> i've got one chance to get back to julie, and i'm gonna take it - with or without you.
hey. aren't you gonna talk me into it?
no. goodbye. thanks for nothing.
you gotta talk me into it. you'll screw up on your own. i mean, a guy's gotta have a <u>sidekick</u>. for moral support! wisecracks - snappy banter - <i></i> it's the land of death, stu, the land of death! don't go in there without your comedy relief!!
all right. you can come.
oh, thank you! thank you! th-- <i></i> something went very, very wrong here.
now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
he's taking her to the land of death, right? so all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! <i></i> stop shaking! i'll protect you.
oh, <u>sure</u>. mr. action hero! why couldn't i be arnold schwarzenegger's figment?
where'd he go??
i don't <u>know</u>.
holy shit.
he's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> anybody here know what oneirix is?
no. i want to give him <u>more</u>. i want to give him a massive dose.
that's not going to stop his nightmare -
i don't want to <u>stop</u> the nightmare, hutch. i want to crank it up. i want to take it right off the charts. i want to <u>scare him awake</u>.
you know, julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. you don't know what it'll do to his brain.
what'll it do if they pull the plug?
stu...stu...
it's not working.
there's a thing here! there's a switch!
stu...look!
what?
isn't that lulu?
what's the maximum safe dose?
most we've ever used is half a cc.
five cc's.
you saved my life, monkeybone. i never would've made it without you.
move it. we got exactly five minutes left.
it's just...now that i'm leaving, i feel like there's lots of things i haven't said. who's gonna look out for you? are you gonna be okay when i'm gone?
oh, don't you worry. i'll be fine.
you've been a hell of a figment, pal. i sure wish i could take you home with me.
awwww. worried about my feelings, are you? well, there's a new twist.
don't joke around, little buddy. i mean it. i really do love y--
no! don't you understand?? he's got my e-ticket! he's got my -
sorry, stu. it's all part of the deal. we've got <u>big plans</u> for that body of yours!
stu?
julie?... hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
sorry, steve, maybe next time. and how's our new guest settling in - ?
you set me up!!
easy, pal! i was coming to congratulate you. it ain't easy snatching one of those e-tickets. steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
why'd you do it? what'd i ever do to you?!?
it's simple, stu. we need nightmares - lots of 'em. so whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! like steve here. poe. rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to atilla and genghis khan!
but <u>why me</u>? why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
the monkey, of course. it was his idea.
monkeybone...!?
nobody wants to be a sidekick, stu. so one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. we help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
you're nuts! i'm a comic strip artist! what's he gonna do - draw <u>really scary cartoons</u>??
oh, no, no, no. y'see, stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. and she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice!
oh, baby, i can't believe you're back.
home sweet home, huh? actually, i was expecting something a little swankier. how much loot does old stu rake in, anyway?
meaning me, of course. i'm referring to myself. you have to assume monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...
baby? why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. i'll be right back.
bitchin' good cake.
stu, are you...feeling okay?
sure. why?
you're acting kind of...odd.
<i></i> in what way?
what are you watching?
ohhh, nothing.
you sure this is...medically advisable?
got a doctor on duty.
well. as long as it's okay with monkeybone -
how was it? i don't recall.
it was great, baby. let's get you to the er.
i'm so sorry, stu. i <u>wanted</u> to tell you what was going on. i really, really liked you.
kitty...<u>my</u> situation is really not important. the thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
you're such a beautiful man. look at you - stuck in this place, and only thinking of her.
listen to me! is there any way i can <u>warn</u> her what monkeybone is up to??
priceless! priceless! this stuff just <u>kills</u> me!
i'm heading in to work, baby. are you sure you'll be okay?
oh yeah. there's just one thing i don't get. "monkeybone creator awakens from coma" that's a big story! that's front page news! but i can't find a <u>word</u> of coverage in this stinkin' rag! <i></i> hey. don't i have a tv show?
they only made the one episode. they've shown it about nineteen times.
i need a new pr guy.
and speaking of which, here's the light of my life, the pert and saucy miss julie mcelroy.
i had to park two blocks away. is something -
what's this about merchandising? you always hated merchandising!
well, baby, i do, but to look at it from another angle...there's a <u>potload</u> of money here.
stu? is that you? where did you <u>go</u>?
me? nowhere. i was asleep.
baby, don't lie. i know you went out.
not me. nope. you must've been dreaming.
you're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, stu. - where are your pants?
<u>well</u>, miss smarty, if i didn't go out, i wouldn't <u>need</u> any pants. now would i?
what's the matter?
i think it's a pig hair. <i></i> how much is mcdonald's offering?
less.
oh, here's something. the city zoo is kicking off a fund-raising campaign. they wonder if you'd be willing to appear at a benefit.
how much?
well, nothing. it's a benefit. but we could probably get <u>people</u> and <u>entertainment tonight</u> to cover it.
i get it. we could give the public the impression that we were doing something... charitable. brilliant!!
and last...you remember bill here, from the bazoom toy company? he's got a little something i think you'll like.
so here's my idea. we do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. we get a big piata. we fill it with monkeybone dolls - <u>hundreds</u> of 'em.
a piata. that's a <u>great</u> idea!
the thing is, i'm responsible for the way he's acting. it's the nightmare juice. it's got to be.
julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
i can't explain this, alice, but i'm not so sure it did. it's as if...he's <u>not stu</u> any more. the stu i love is gone! <i></i> he spends all his time in the garage. he says he's...autographing.
don't ask where i got it.
you can't do this! you'll get in trouble!
you're the only true-hearted man i ever met. you find a way back to that girl of yours and make her happy.
how am i gonna get past the guards?
<u>i'll</u> worry about the guards. <i></i> okay, stu. see you in a day or two.
go. just <u>go</u>.
thanks, kitty, i'll never forget you for th--
"4/17: subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet."
they had a case like that at johns hopkins. wires got crossed between hands and feet.
you're really gonna pop the question?
got the ring. got the airline tickets. soon as they break that piata, we'll grab a cab - and it's off to the land of palm trees and coconuts.
i can't believe you. you used to hate being the center of attention. now you're proposing, in public, at a benefit.
yeah, i was thinking...i mean, i'm a celebrity now, do i really want to get married? but on the other hand, if you're married, they can't testify against you.
the nightmare juice! it's gone! somebody switched it for a beaker of grape kool-aid!!
kool-aid!? but who'd would want to -
you're mad at me. great. you have every right to be. but we're both mad at dark town. we're both mad at hypnos.
oh, sure. now you're gonna tell me it was all <u>his</u> idea. you were completely innocent -
i'm not going to tell you that. i wanted that e- ticket. i wanted it so bad i'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and i'd do the same again.
<u>why</u>??
i have a girl up there. and i never - i should've - i just want to tell her i love her.
i'm a simple man. i'm just doing my job. i <u>enjoy</u> my job. why does everyone want to make it difficult for me? stealing tickets, switching bodies...it is <u>so</u> <u>irresponsible</u>.
death, i'm trying to make things right. take my soul. turn me into a paper doll. but give me just one lousy hour.
well - you'd need a body.
if it wasn't for that comic strip of yours, i wouldn't be doing this. but a good chuckle is darned hard to come by. <i></i> that one where monkeybone stole the soap cake out of the urinal - i thought i would die.
coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
<i>de nada</i>. now, come here...bend over...before i change my mind.
bend over?
we'll hop a plane tonight. an island ceremony. an abba dabba honeymoon!
it looks so...<u>new</u>.
it is new. why wouldn't it be new?
but the heirloom ring. your grandmother's ring...
heirloom? huh? you want a <u>used ring</u> - ?
boy, the nuts are out tonight. what'd that creep call you - ?
he called me "doc."
death!!
i dress up when i want to make an impression. - so how'd it go?
fine, thanks. saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. <i></i> i guess i'm yours now.
hey. where's monkeybone?
back in your head, where he belongs. <i></i> no offense, stu, but on your own you're kinda vanilla. i didn't want to send you back without him.
back? you're sending me back?
it's irregular, but...i just love that strip of yours. i figure i'll take the "family circus" guy instead.
death! thank you!
thank me next time you see me.
oh, stu. tell me i'm not dreaming.
baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
what's the matter?
my <u>tail</u> itches.
