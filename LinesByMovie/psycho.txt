call your boss and tell him you are taking the rest of the afternoon off. it is friday anyway... and hot.
what do i do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
we could laze around here a while longer.
checking out time is three p.m. hotels of this sort are not interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up...  sam, i hate having to be with you in a place like this.
I have heard of married couples who deliberately spend occasional nights in cheap hotels. they say it...
when you are married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
you sure talk like a girl who is been married.
sam!
I am sorry, mary.  my old dad used to say 'when you can not change a situation, laugh at it.' nothing ridicules a thing like laughing at it.
I have lost my girlish laughter.
the only girlish thing you have lost.
sam. this is the last time.
for what?
this! meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! you come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... i wish you would not even come.
okay. what do we do instead, write each other lurid love letters?
i have not time to argue. I am a working girl.
and I am a working man! we are a regular working-class tragedy!
it is tragic! or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
you can not laugh at it, huh?
can you?
sure. it is like laughing through a broken jaw, but...
and besides, when you say i make tax- deductible excuses you make me out a criminal.
you could not be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
i wish i were. not an active criminal but... a nice guy with the conscience of a criminal.  next best thing to no conscience at all.
i have to go, sam.
i can come down next week.
no.
not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
we can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
and after the steak... do we send sister to the movies and turn mama's picture to the wall?
sam! no!
all right.
mary, whenever it is possible, tax- deductible or not, i want to see deductible you. and under any conditions.  even respectability.
you make respectability sound... disrespectful.
I am all for it! it requires patience and temperance and a lot of sweating- out... otherwise, though, it is only hard work.  but if i can see you, touch you even as simply as this... i will not mind.
I am fed up with sweating for people who are not there. i sweat to pay off my father's debts... and he is in his grave... i sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony, and she is living on the other side of the world somewhere.
i pay, too. they also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
a couple of years and the debts will be paid off. and if she ever re- marries, the alimony stops... and then...
i have not even been married once yet!
yeah, but when you do... you will swing.
sam, let's go get married.
and live with me in a storeroom behind a hardware store in fairvale. we will have a lot of laughs. when i send my ex-wife her money, you can lick the stamps.
I will lick the stamps.
you know what I would like? a clear, empty sky... and a plane, and us in it... and somewhere a private island for sale, where we can run around without our... shoes on.  and the wherewithal to buy what I would like.  mary, you want to cut this off, go out and find yourself someone available.
I am thinking of it.
how can you even think a thing like that!
do not miss your plane.
hey, we can leave together can not we?
I am late... and you have to put your shoes on.
is not mr. lowery back from lunch?
he is lunching with the man who is buying the harris street property, you know, that oil lease man...  so that is why he is late.  you getting a headache?
it will pass. headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
you got aspirins? i have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  teddy was furious when he found out I would taken tranquilizers!
were there any calls?
teddy called.  me... and my mother called to see if teddy called. oh, and your sister called to say she is going to tucson to do some buying and she will be gone the whole weekend and...
are not you going to take the pills?  they will knock that headache out.
i do not need pills... just sleep.
in quite a hurry.
yes.  i did not mean to sleep so long. i was afraid I would have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so i decided to pull over...
you slept here all night?
yes. as i said, i could not keep my eyes...
there are plenty of motels in this area. you should have... i mean, just to be safe...
i did not intend to sleep all night! i just pulled over... have i broken any laws?
no, m'am.
then I am free to go...?
is anything wrong?
of course not! am i acting as if... something is wrong?
frankly, yes.
please... I would like to go...
is there?
is there what?  I have told you there is nothing wrong... except that I am in a hurry and you are taking up my time...
now wait just a moment! turn your motor off, please.
in the course of my duty, i never "take up" anyone's time, whether it is to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! believe that, m'am.  now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that is one thing. but when you act as if I have just placed you under arrest...
I am sorry.
no need to apologize...
wait a minute!
now what?
may i see your license?
why?
please.
I am in no mood for trouble!
what?
there is an old saying, "first customer of the day is always the most trouble!" but like i said, I am in no mood for it so I am just going to treat you so fair and square you will not have one human reason to give me...
can i trade in my car and take another?
you can do anything you have a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  that yours?
yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I am just...
sick of the sight of it!  well, suppose you look around for something that strikes your eyes and meanwhile I will have my mechanic give yours the once over and... want some coffee? i was just about...
no. thank you. I am in... a hurry. i just want to make a change and start...
that is the one i'd've picked for you myself!
how much?
go ahead! spin it around the block. now i know you do not know anything about engine condition, but you can feel, can not you... and it is all in the feel, believe me, you feel that one around the block...
it looks fine. how much will it be, with my car...?
you mean you do not want the usual day and a half to think it over?  you are in a hurry! somebody chasin' you?
of course not. please.
well... heck, this is the first time i ever saw the customer high-pressure the salesman!  I would figure roughly...  ...your car plus five hundred.
five hundred.
aha! always got time to argue money, huh...?
all right.
i take it... you can prove that car's yours... i mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
i think i have the necessary papers. is there a ladies room...
in the building ...  mary starts for the building, glancing once in the direction of the patrolman.
i think you would better give it a trial spin. do not want any bad word of mouth about california charlie.
I would really rather not. please.  can not we just settle this and...
I will be perfectly honest with you, ma'am. it is not that i do not trust you, but...
but what?  is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? do you think I have stolen... my car?
no, m'am. i was only about to say, I have sent my mechanic out to give your car a little test... that is all.
I would like to be ready when he gets back.
okay. if you will come along...
yes, mr. lowery.
caroline...? mary still is not in?
no, mr. lowery... but then she is always a bit late on monday mornings.
buzz me the minute she comes in.
call her sister! if no one's answering at the house....
i called her sister, mr. lowery, where she works, the music makers music store, you know? and she does not know where mary is any more than we do.
you better run out to the house. she may be... unable to answer the phone...
her sister's going to do that.  she is as worried as we are.
dirty night.
you have a vacancy?
we have twelve vacancies. twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  they moved away the highway.
i thought I would gotten off the main...
i knew you must have. no one stops here anymore unless they do.
your home address. oh, just the town will do.
los angeles.
i want sleep more than anything. except maybe, food.
there is a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside fairvale.
am i that close to fairvale?
fifteen miles. I will get your bags.
stuffy in here.  well... the mattress is soft and there are hangers in the closet and... stationary with "bates' motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there....
the bathroom.
I will be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
thank you, mr. bates.
norman bates.
you have something most girls never have.
i have?
there is no name for it... but it is something that, that puts a person at ease.
thank you. again.
you are not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
no.
then will you do me a favor?  will you have supper here?  i was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I would like it if you would come up to the house and... i do not set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
I would like to.
all right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and I will come for you soon as it is ready...  ...with my trusty umbrella.
i will not have you bringing strange young girls in for supper...  ...by candlelight, i suppose, in the cheap erotic fashion of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
mother, please...
and then what? after supper, music? whispers?
mother, she is just a stranger... hungry, and the weather's bad...
mother, she is just a stranger!  as if men do not desire strangers, as if... oh, i refuse to speak of disgusting things because they disgust me! you understand, boy?
go on, go tell her she will not be appeasing her ugly appetite with my food... or my son! or do i have to tell her, cause you do not have the guts? huh, boy? you have the guts, boy?
shut up! shut up!
I have caused you some trouble.
mother...  ...what is the phrase... "she is not herself today"... i think that is it.
you should not have bothered. i really do not have that much of an appetite.
I am sorry. i wish... people could apologize for other people.
do not worry about it.  but as long as you have made us supper, we may as well eat it. huh?
you are very... kind.
it is all for you. I am not hungry. please go ahead.
you eat like a bird.
you would know, of course.
not really. i hear that expression, that one eats "like a bird," is really a falsie, i mean a falsity, because birds eat a tremendous lot.  oh, i do not know anything about birds. my hobby is stuffing things... taxidermy. and i guess I would just rather stuff birds because...  well, i hate the look of beasts when they are stuffed, foxes and chimps and all... some people even stuff dogs and cats... but i can't... i think only birds look well stuffed because they are rather...  passive, to begin with... most of them...
it is a strange hobby. curious, i mean.
uncommon, too.
i imagine so.
it is not as expensive as you would think. cheap, really. needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything.
a man should have a hobby.
it is more than a hobby... sometimes... a hobby is supposed to pass the time, not fill it.
is your time so empty?
oh, no!  i run the office, tend the cabins and grounds, do little chores for mother... the ones she allows i might be capable of doing.
you go out... with friends?
friends? who needs friends.  a boy's best friend is his mother.  you have never had an empty moment in your whole life. have you?
only my share.
where are you going? i do not mean to pry...
I am looking for a private island.
what are you running away from?
why do you ask that?
no. people never run away from anything.  the rain did not last very long.  you know what i think? i think we are all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever climb out. we scratch and claw... but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.
sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
i was born in mine. i do not mind it anymore.
you should... mind it.
oh i do... but i say i don't.
if anyone ever spoke to me, the way i heard... the way she spoke to you, i do not think i could ever laugh again.
sometimes when she talks that way to me I would like to... curse her out and leave her forever!  or at least, defy her.  but i couldn't. she is ill.
she sounded strong...
i mean... ill.  she had to raise me all by herself after my dad died... i was only five... and it must have been a strain. oh, she did not have to go out to work or anything, dad left us with a little something... anyway, a few years ago... mother met a man. he talked her into building this motel... we could have talked her into anything... and when.  well... it was just too much for her when he died, too... and the way he died... oh, it is nothing to talk about when you are eating.  anyway, it was too much of a loss for my mother... she had nothing left.
except you.
a son is a poor substitute for a lover.
why do not you go away?
to a private island, like you?
no, not like me.
it is too late for me. and besides... who would look after her? she would be alone up there, the fire would go out... damp and cold, like a grave. when you love someone, you do not do that to them, even if you hate them. oh, i do not hate her.  i hate... what she is become. i hate... the illness.
would not it be better if you put her in... someplace...
an institution? a madhouse?  people always call a madhouse "someplace."  put her in someplace!
I am sorry... i did not mean it to sound uncaring...
what do you mean about caring?  have you ever seen one of those places? inside? laughing and tears and cruel eyes studying you... and my mother there?  why? has she harmed you? she is as harmless as... one of these stuffed birds.
i am sorry. i only felt... it seemed she was harming you. i meant...
well? you meant well?  people always mean well, they cluck their thick tongues and shake their heads and suggest so very delicately that...
I have suggested it myself. but i hate to even think such a thing.  she needs me... and it isn't...  ...it is not as if she were a maniac, a raving thing... it is just that... sometimes she goes a little mad. we all go a little mad sometimes. have not you?
yes, and just one time can be enough.  thank you.
thank you, norman.
norman.
you are not going to... to your room already?
I am very tired. and I will have a long drive tomorrow. all the way back to phoenix.
phoenix?
i stepped into a private trap back there -- and i want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  before it is too late for me, too.
why do not you stay a little while, just for talking.
I would like to, but...
alright. I will see you in the morning. I will bring you breakfast.  what time will you...
very early. dawn.
alright, miss...
crane.
that is it.
good night.
yes?
may i talk to you?
sure...
I am mary's sister.
lila.
is mary here?
is something wrong?
i want to know if my sister is here.
here?
with you.
where?
i do not know where. in your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
what is the matter?
do not you know?
what should i know?
to begin with, where mary is. do you?
no. i take it you do not either?  how long?
last friday. she left work, and home... i was in tucson over the weekend... i have not heard from her, not even a phone call.
and you thought she would come up here, to me? if she had, what reason would she have for not calling you?
a good reason, i suppose.
well what do you think, we eloped or something? or we are living in sin and...
mr. loomis, you are so busy being defensive that you have not even reacted to the most serious fact of all. mary is missing.
i was getting to that!
what do you know about it?
nothing! you are putting me on the defensive.
look, if you two are in this thing together, i do not care, it is none of my business... but i want to see mary. i want her to tell me she is all right and it is none of my business. then I will go back to phoenix and...
what thing?
huh?
what thing could we be in together?
i hate tears.
is mary... in trouble?
yes.
well why did not she come to me... call me...?
not that kind...  you men and your egos.
never mind my ego. let's talk about mary.
let's all talk about mary.
who are you, friend?
milt arbogast, private investigator.  where is she, miss crane?
i do not know.
would not have been able to tail you if you did.
what is your interest?
money.
somebody better tell me what is going on and tell me fast! i can take so much and then...
your girl friend stole forty thousand dollars.
why?
must have needed it.
what are you talking about?  what is this?
someone has seen her. someone always sees a girl with forty thousand dollars.  she is your girl friend, is not she?
sam, they do not want to prosecute, they just want the money back. it was all in cash...
casharoonie!
sam, if she is here...
you came up here on a hunch, miss crane? nothing more? no phone call... from him, or from your sister herself?
not even a hunch. just hope.
with a little checking, i could get to believe you.
i do not care if you do or... i want to see mary... before she gets in any deeper...
did you check in phoenix... hospitals... maybe she had an accident... a hold-up...
she was seen leaving town in her car. seen by her very victims, i might add.
i do not believe it.  do you?
yes... i just... did. the moment they told me...
you might have doubted for say five minutes or so, sister.
i just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'she stole the money.' 'we do not want to get her in trouble.' 'no do not bring the police in'...
it was her boss' idea not to report it to the police?
no. the man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and i... i should have called the police.
he must have had a darn good reason for wanting them kept out of it... all that cash...
i ought to call the police right now!
no.
why not? sam, is she hiding here? are you two planning to go away with the money?
how could i go away? I am in debt up to my...  if she did steal that money...  it is hard to believe she did because it is hard to see why she would. unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
she have not even called you?
i did not see her... and i did not hear from her! believe that!
i need to... i need to believe something. this is the first time I have ever come up against anything i couldn't... understand.
you have led a charmed life.
no. i just think... anything can be explained. but mary, doing a thing like this... i do not know how to handle...
maybe we can handle it together.
i came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all i know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I would better go home.
i think she will contact me if she contacts anybody. why do not you stay here. when she shows up... or calls... be here.
you want me to stay here?
she will need both of us.
where... can i stay?
first rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. come on.  after we check you in we will go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. then we will come back here... and wait.
i always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  twelve in fact. twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
in the past two days I have been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. this is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
i do not really forget the sign, it just does not seem... any use.  this used to be the main highway.  want to register, please?
sit down. i do not want to trouble you, just want to ask...
no trouble. today's linen day. i change all the beds once a week, whether they have been used or not... dampness. i hate the smell of dampness.  it is such a dank smell.
you out to buy a motel?
no.
oh. i thought... you said you would been to so many in two days...  what was it you wanted to ask?
I am looking for a missing person.  my name's arbogast, private investigator...  trying to trace a young girl who is been missing almost a week. from phoenix.  it is a private matter... family wants to forgive her...  she is not in trouble.
i did not think the police went searching for people who were not in trouble.
I am not the police.
oh.
we have reason to believe she came this way... might have stopped in this area...  did she stop here?
no. no one has stopped here in weeks...
mind looking at the picture before committing yourself?
committing myself to what? you sure talk like a policeman.
look at the picture. please.
no. at least i do not recall.
she might have used an alias. mary crane's the real name, but she might have registered...
i do not even bother with guests registering any more... i mean, little by little, you drop the formalities.  i should not even bother to change the linen. i guess habits die hard. which reminds me...
now there is a couple even remarking about your sign, and see how easily you forgot them?
what?
you thought no one has stopped here in weeks. now, try to remember if this girl...
do not know where she got "marie," but "samuels" figures. her boy friend's name is sam.  was she in disguise? or do you want to check the picture again?
i did not lie to you. i just have trouble keeping track of... time.
it was raining and her hair did not look like that... damped out, i guess.
tell me all about her.
she arrived kind of late, wet and hungry and she was very tired and went right to bed and left early.
how early?
very early. dawn.
of which morning?
the following morning. sunday.
no one met her?
no.
or arrived with her.
no.
she did not call anyone? even locally?
no.
you did not spend the whole night with her did you?
no! of all...
how do you know she did not make a call?
she was tired. she said she had a long drive ahead of her, in the morning... yes, now I am remembering very clearly because I am picturing. when you make a picture of the moment in your mind, you can remember every detail. she was sitting back there, no she was standing up, with some sandwich still in her hand, and she said she had to drive a long way.
back where?
what do you mean?
you said she was sitting "back there," or standing rather...
oh. my private parlor. she had an awful hunger... so i made her some supper. and then she went to bed and left in the morning. i did not even see her leave.
how did she pay you?
what?
cash or check? for the cabin...
cash.
and when she left, she never came back.
why should she? I am sorry, i have work to do, mr... if you do not mind...
i do mind. if it do not jell, it am not aspic!  this am not jelling.
i do not know what you expect me to know about... people come and go...
she is not still here, is she?
not at all!
suppose i wanted to search the cabins, all twelve... would i need a warrant?
look, if you will not believe me, go ahead. you can help me make beds if you like.  come on.
i guess I have got one of those faces you can not help believing.
anyone at home?
i live there. alone.
someone is sitting in that window.
my mother.
she's... ill. confined to her room. it is practically living alone.
if this girl mary crane were here, you would have no reason to hide her would you?
of course not.
if she paid you well?
now, look...!
or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you would not be fooled... you would know she was just using you. would not you?
I am not a fool! and I am not capable of being fooled! not even by women!
i did not mean that as a slur on your manhood. I am sorry.
that is all right. maybe she could have fooled me.  but...  she did not fool my mother.
your mother met her?  can i talk to your mother?
no. i told you, she is confined...
just for a moment. she might have picked up a hint you would miss.
sick old women are sharp. come on, i will not disturb...
no! just no!  i have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I am near it. there is just so much pushing i can take and i think...
all right!  might save me a lot of leg-work if i could just talk to your mother.  but I would need a warrant for that, will not i?
sometimes saturday night has a lonely sound. ever notice, lila?
sam. he said an hour. or less.
it is been three.
are we just going to go on sitting here?
he will be back. let's sit still and hang on, okay?
you have an awfully nice habit, sam.
hundreds! which one is your pet?
whenever i start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that god-looks- out-for-everybody look and... i feel better.
i feel better when you feel better.
where is the old highway?
you want to run out there, bust in on arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
yes.
that would not be a wise thing to do.
patience does not run in our family. sam, I am going out there!
arbogast said...
an hour! or less!
got the number of the motel out on the old highway? bates, i think.
sam! why call when we can go?
and maybe pass arbogast on the road?  thanks.
probably on his way back right now.
sam, I am going.
you will never find it.
stay here.
why can not i go out there with you?
i do not know...  one of us has to be here in case arbogast's on the way.
just wait here?
contemplate your... panic button.
he did not come back here?
sam.
no arbogast. no bates. and only the old lady at home...  a sick old lady unable to answer the door... or unwilling.
where could he have gone?
maybe he got some definite lead. maybe he went right on...
without calling me?
in a hurry.
sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. do not you think he would have called if he had anything...
yes. i think he would have.
let's go see al chambers.
who is he?
he is the deputy sheriff around here.
our deputy sleeps.
well?
nothing.  just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
does that mean we can't...
no. I am just procrastinating.  people hate when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night.  come on.
oh?
sorry, mrs. chambers. i hate bothering you...
you didn't!  it is tinkerbell.  al wants to be sure he will hear it if anyone rings it in the middle of the night.  well come on in, at least!
we have a problem.
let's go out back and have some coca while the men are talking.
no, thank you. it is my problem, too.
i do not know where to start...  except at the beginning.
yes.
this is lila crane, from phoenix. she is been here for a few days, looking for her sister. there is a private detective helping... and, well, we got a call tonight, from this detective, saying he would traced mary...
mary is lila's sister?
yes. he traced her to that motel, out on the old highway...
bates' motel.  he has a mind like a mechanical brain and the more information you feed it... go on, sam.
he traced her there and called us to say he was going to question mrs. bates...
norman took a wife?
no. an old woman, his mother.  that was early this evening. and we have not seen or heard from him since. i went out to the motel, just got back. no one was in the office, and...
will you help us? i think something is wrong out there!
now. your sister is missing how long?
she left phoenix a week ago yesterday. and no trace until...
how did you and this detective come to trace her to fairvale?
they thought she would be coming to me.
left phoenix under her own steam?
yes.
she am not missing so much as she is run away.
yes.
from what?
she stole some money.
a lot?
forty thousand dollars.
and the police have not been able to...
everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
explains the private detective. he traced her to the bates place.  what did he exactly say when he called you?
mary had been there, one night, and had left.
with the forty thousand dollars?
he did not mention the money.  what he said on the phone is not important, is it?  he was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! that is what i want you to do something about!
like what?
go out there! find somebody, ask some questions!  I am sorry if i seem over-anxious to you. i keep thinking... something is wrong. i have to know what!
i think something is wrong, too, miss. but not the same thing. i think your private detective is what is wrong.  i think he got himself a hot lead as to where your sister was going... probably from norman bates...  and called you to keep you still while he took off after her and the money.
he said he was dissatisfied... and was going back.
why do not you call norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it will make the girl feel better, albert.
at this hour?
he was out when i was there. if he is back he probably is not even in bed yet.
he was not out when you were there. he just was not answering the door in the dead of night... like some people do. this fellow lives like a hermit...
recluse. kinder word.
you must remember that bad business out there. about ten years ago...
I have only been here five. right now it feels like ten, but...
all right! then call! at least, call!
norman? sheriff chambers.  been just fine, thanks. listen, we got some worries here. did you have a man stop out there tonight...  well, this one would not be a customer, anyway. a private detective, name of...
arbogast.
arbogast.  and after he left?  no, it is okay, norman. how is it been going out there?  well, i think you oughta unload that place and open up closer in to the action, a smaller place, you know... but...
please!
sorry i got you up, boy. go back to sleep. yeah, be glad to.  said to give you his regards.
was that all?
this detective was out there and norman told him about the girl and the detective thanked him and went away.
you should have called in the police the second you found your sister has skipped. you go starting private investigations, using people you do not even know...
what difference does that...
your detective told you a nakedfaced lie.
barefaced.
he told you he was not coming right back cause he wanted to question norman bates' mother, right?
yes.
norman bates' mother has been dead and buried in greenlawn cemetery for the last ten years!
i helped norman pick out the dress she was buried in. periwinkle blue.
it am not only local history, sam, it is the only murder-and-suicide case in fairvale ledgers! mrs. bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  strychnine. ugly way to die.
norman found them dead together.  in bed.
you mean that old woman i saw sittin' in the window was not norman bates' mother?
maybe you saw mary!
I would know the difference between mary and an old woman.
now wait a minute, sam. you sure you saw an old woman?
yes! in the house behind the motel. i pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
and you want to tell me you saw norman bates' mother.
we thought, if you did not mind, we would go out to the motel with you.
he is already been.
went out before service.
have you two had breakfast?
you did not find anything.
nothing. here, let's clear the path.
did he say anything about my sister?
just what he told your detective.
no mother.
you must have seen an illusion, sam. now, i know you are not the seeing- illusion type... but no woman was illusion there and i do not believe in ghosts, so there it is!
i still feel...
can see you do. sorry i could not make you feel better. you want to come to my office this afternoon and report a missing person... and the theft, is what you want to do!  sooner you drop this thing in the lap of the law, that is the sooner you will stand a chance of your sister bein' picked up. how about that?
i do not know.
maybe i am the seeing-illusions type.
you are not.
i will not feel satisfied unless i got out there, sam.
neither will i.
i wonder if we will ever see mary again.
of course we will.
alive.
where did you go to college?
i didn't. i got a job, too.  i wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me?  some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you do not let them.
she was willing to lick the stamps.
i wonder so many things about her now.  why she never told me about you...  funny, when you think there is an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
we were going to get married. are going to get married!
do you know how i found out about you? i found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, sam.
this is the old highway.
i suppose... when you were able to marry her she would have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
watch your tenses.
huh?
she always tries to be proper.
you going to wait here for me?
I am going with you. but we would better decide what we are going to say and do when we walk in...
we are going to register. as man and wife. and get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
you will not believe it...  but this will be the first time I have ever pulled one of those man- and-wife-renting-cabin capers!
i believe it.
i wonder where norman bates does his hermiting?
someone was at that window. i saw the curtain move.
just coming up to ring for you.
i suppose you want a cabin.
we would hoped to make it straight to san francisco, but we do not like the look of that sky. looks like a bad day coming... does not it.
I will take you to...
better sign in first, has not we?
it is not necessary.
uh, uh! my boss is paying for this trip... ninety percent business... and he wants practically notarized receipts. i better sign in and get a receipt.
I will get your bags.
have not any.
I will show you the cabin.
we should have asked for cabin one... the one mary was in.
I am glad we didn't.
we have to go into that cabin and search it, sam... no matter what we are afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
i know.  do you think if something happened, it happened there?
sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably could not even sell...  what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else?  forty thousand dollars?
how could we prove...  well, if he opens a new motel on the new highway... say, a year from now...
there must be some proof that exists right now! something that proves he got that money away from mary... some way!
what makes you sound so certain?
arbogast! sam, he liked me... or felt sorry for me... and he was starting to feel the same about you. i heard it when he called... in his voice, a caring. he would not have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us.  unless he was stopped. and he was stopped, so he must have found out something!
sorry.
hospital clean.
what?
the bathroom. look at how clean it is. the one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
what is it?
it did not get washed down. it is figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of.  some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
that is proof mary was here!  it would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
bates never denied mary was here.
yes.  but maybe this proves that bates found out about the money.
do we simply ask him where he is hidden it?
sam, that old woman, whoever she is. i think she told arbogast something! and i want her to tell us the same thing!
you can not go up there.
why not?
bates.
looking for me?
yes, matter of fact.  the wife's taking a nap and... i can never keep quiet enough for her... so i thought I would look you up and... talk.
satisfied with your cabin?
fine.
I have been doing all the talking so far, have not i?
yes.
i always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. yet there you are, doing all the listening!  you are alone here, are not you?  it would drive me crazy.
that would be a rather extreme reaction, would not it?
just an expression...  what i meant was... I would do just about anything... to get away.  would not you?
I am not saying you should not be contented here, I am just doubting that you are. i think if you saw a chance to get out from under... you would unload this place...
this place! this is not 'a place.' it is my only world. i grew up in that house back there. i was a happy child. my mother and i... we were more than happy.
and now that your mother's dead?
my mother is not dead!
i did not think so.
you look frightened. have i been saying something frightening?
i do not know what you have been saying.
I have been talking about your mother... about your motel. how are you going to do it?
do what?
buy a new one! in a new town! where you will not have to hide your mother!
shut up!
where will you get the money to do that, bates... or do you already have it... socked away... a lot of it...
leave me alone!
...forty thousand dollars!
leave me alone!
it is regular. okay?
i could stand something regular.
