now you better cool out a minute, boy.  you already almost got your head blown to pieces.
will you listen, dammit!
do not piss me off, junior.  or i will repaint this office with your brains.
jason is alive.  we dug up his body.  i was gonna cremate it and...
hold it.  whoa... what is your name, son?
tommy jarvis.  we got to do something.  he is even more powerful now that...
are not you the kid whose mother and friends were....
yeah.  jason murdered them and...
and you have been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, have not you?
yes, but they released me because...
no problem, rick.  come over and meet a former resident here, tommy jarvis.  he is got some kinda prank going about...
there is no time for this bullshit...
why did not you cremate him?!
they were gonna!  but some asshole sent a lot of money to give jason and his mother a decent burial. now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  in the morning I will call that clinic and see if they...
if you would just go to the cemetery, you will see I am not lying.
either you go to sleep or I will come in there and put you out.
you are going to be sorry you did not listen to me.
you are going to be sorry if you do not shut the fuck up.
will you slow down?  it is hard enough to read this thing.
well, who told me to take this cow path?
you admit the sign did say "camp forest green," with an arrow pointing this way.
i admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
darren, we better turn around.
why?
why?  because I have seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly.
yeah... we are going to scare him.
we are going to scare him?!
that is right.  just drive toward him.  he will move.  nobody wants to die.
that is a freakin' fact.  least of all us.
just drive.  he will get out of our way.
oh, jeez.
that is it.  we are driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
do not worry about it.  just stay cool.
stay cool?  you am not dirty harry. now stop it.
come on, dad.  you could have rick drive down cunningham road and look for them.
megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
it is just that darren and lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
all the little kids arrive today. we are not ready to deal with that alone.
i sympathize with you kids.  the best i can do is call the station in carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
i got a bad feeling of what might have happened to them.
jason who?
megan, get away from him.  he is dangerous.
yes!
no!...  ... you kids better leave.  this boy here is not well and i need to talk to him in private.
but, dad, we...
megan, take your friends back to the camp.  I will let you know if i hear anything about your counselors.
i was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  but i do not want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
but they have to be warned, sheriff.  jason will return to the area that is familiar.  no matter what you call it, it is still camp crystal lake to him.
once we nail roy, that is it. victory is ours.
this is taking forever.  I am starving.
that is your problem, larry. that is why your sales are always below quota.  your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
my ass.
yeah, that is fat too.
you become a whole other person when you are out here, stan.  and i do not like it.
this is a man's game.  requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
....with a woman's touch.
now wait a second!  i thought burt shot you.
see any paint?...  ...sorry, guys, i did in mr. commando.  survival is the name of the game, and that flag is mine.
never should have let her play.
it is a damn company executive game, and she is a damn company exec.
it is kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
he really believes jason's still alive, does not he?
but that is no what worries me the most...it's how far he will go to try and prove it.
come on, you guys!  the game's over!!
you do not know for sure.  what about roy?  nobody's seen him.
of course not.  if he has not already accidentally pelleted himself, I am sure he is lost.
yeah, but the game's not over until it is over.
ahh, nothing.
i could swear i heard...
I am getting real tired of this maniac.
maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
better call an ambulance first.
i got to show you jason's grave.
I have seen it.
please, sheriff.  you will see we dug it up.
do not concern yourself, martin. this boy needs treatment.  we are taking care of it.  sorry for the disturbance.
jason's not in his coffin!  hawes is!  dig it up!  you got to dig it up!!
so where is cort gone off to?
are you ready?  he is taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
which is?
boy scouting.
you gotta be kidding!
okay, okay.  i suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by colonel mustard, with the knife.
huh?  oh, come on, sis.  I am tellin' ya, we can not play clue with just two people.
why not?  i used to play it alone. i love murder games.  have you ever played the consulting detective?
no...did megan say when she is coming back from her...visit?
of course not.  she probably took him a loaf of bread with a saw hidden in it.  i still do not get it.  why him?  i mean, he is cute alright, but...
hi.  everything's all right now. we are here.
yeah, we are here.
so what happened?
there was this monster.  he was after me.  he wanted to kill me.
you mean you had a bad dream.
no, he was real.  like on tv.
okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
nancy.
well, nancy, I am paula... remember?  this is sissy, and we are going to be right out there all night so nothing can hurt you. okay?...
...good.  so no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
no more.
i just realized something. where is cort?  i have not seen him for hours.
i do not know.  he called somebody, then took off.
he did not say anything?
yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."
i thought that was the end of the song.
great.  just great.
if this thing is burned out, friggin' horace will ground my butt.
who is horace?
my friggin' stepfather and asshole- in-residence.
what?
go out and plug the cord back in.
what?  who pulled it out?!
will you hurry up!  i gotta get this fuckmobile back before horace finds out i took it.
alright, alright.
that is it.  pull over.  I am drivin'.
no way...  ...i wanna rock!
when are you going to stop treating me like one!
when you stop acting like one... tommy jarvis is a very sick boy. and you...
how do you know?  did you take his temperature?
you watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
what it is?
not what...who.  seems your boyfriend wants people to believe jason has returned.
i thought jason was only a legend?
he is.  only tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...you stay put.  and I am not kidding.
yeah, hi.  listen, I have got to talk to your dad.  about jason. I have got a plan.  i need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  something happened tonight and he is sure you are responsible.  if he finds you, he'll...
i already have a very good idea what could have happened...  ...megan, jason is out there.  he has to be stopped.  I am positive he is heading back to the lake area.  he will keep killing until...
is that all you found?
i wish it was.
better get out the hefty bags... looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
he sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
whaddya mean?
happy friday the 13th.
what is goin' on?
i think somebody is messin' around out there.
what?
hide it behind the gas station. then we can get the hell out of here.
did not you say you needed some supplies to do this?
uh...yes.  but...
then let's get goin'.  we can argue on the way.  you tell me what you need...  ...i'll make sure you get in.
you got it.  just keep an eye out for roadblocks.
okay.  there is one.
with extreme car, for god's sake. if that kid is with her, there is every good chance he will do something crazy.
please do not do anything crazy.
it is all over.
it is just beginning.
where did you get this?
i found it outside.
you know what?  sissy and cort are playing jokes.  you know, trying to scare each other.
why?
well, grown-ups think it is funny to be scared.
are they grown-ups?
that is debatable.
huh?
i can not believe no one called back.  i better...
who ya calling?
but what if they try and scare us?
we will scare 'em right back.
...and i said, shut up!
all he is asking is for you to check it out.
you got me where you want me. there is no reason not...
if i had you where i really wanted you, they would be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
can not you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
we have!  trying to track you down.  the phone there is disconnected.
does not that tell you something?!
yeah...they should have paid their bill.
you just sit tight, jason.  once the authorities from carpenter get here, you'll...
sheriff, you better take this.
rick.  keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I will be back as soon as i can.
daddy, what is going on?
and make sure my daughter stays put...  ...she's grounded.
no.  no, it is not...
yes, megan.  tommy jarvis is a killer.  a very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...
I am sure cort and sissy are back in their cabins.  so you just go back to sleep and do not worry.
but what i get scared again?
shhh...you know what i used to do when i was a little girl when i got scared?
so what are ya drawin'?
what is it to ya?
there...ya happy?
no.
why?
'cause it stinks.
okay, give it back.
come and get it.
sorry, megan.  not this time.
wait a minute. i just...
i thank you for getting me out. but i gotta finish what i started.
are you sure this is going to work? i mean, why did not we bring that gun and just blast him away?
it probably would not have any effect on him.  the only sure way to stop jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
lake forest green?
crystal lake...where the nightmare began.
they did show up.  is not that great?
i hope so.
whew...okay, hand me those padlocks.
did you hear me?!
yes.  and i said, hand me those padlocks.
