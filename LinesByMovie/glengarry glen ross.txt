...and i'm going to get bounced and you're...
...let me...are you listening to me...?
yes.
let me tell you something, shelly. i do what i'm hired to do. i'm...wait a second.  i'm hired to watch the leads.  i'm given...hold on, i'm given a policy.  my job is to do that.  what i'm told.  that's it.  you, wait a second, anybody falls below a certain mark i'm not permitted to give them the premium leads.
then how do they come up above that mark?  with dreck...?  that's nonsense.  explain this to me. 'cause it's a waste, and it's a stupid waste.  i want to tell you something...
you know what those leads cost?
the premium leads.  yes.  i know what they cost.  john.  because i, i generated the dollar revenue sufficient to buy them.  nineteen senny-nine, you know what i made? senny-nine?  ninety-six thousand dollars.  john?  for murray... for mitch...look at the sheets...
murray said...
fuck him.  fuck murray.  john?  you know?  you tell him i said so. what does he fucking know?  he's going to have a "sales" contest...you know what our sales contest used to be?
money.  a fortune.  money lying on the ground.  murray?  when was the last time he went out on a sit? sales contest?  it's laughable. it's cold out there now, john. it's tight.  money is tight.  this ain't sixty-five.  it ain't.  it just ain't.  see?  see?  now, i'm a good man--but i need a...
murray said...
john.  john...
will you please wait a second. shelly.  please.  murray told me: the hot leads...
...ah, fuck this...
the...shelly?  the hot leads are assigned according to the board.  during the contest. period.  anyone who beats fifty per...
that's fucked.  that's fucked.  you don't look at the fucking percentage. you look at the gross.
either way.  you're out.
i'm out.
yes.
i'll tell you why i'm out.  i'm out, you're giving me toilet paper. john.
i've seen those leads.  i saw them when i was at homestead, we pitched those cocksuckers rio rancho nineteen sixty-nine they wouldn't buy.  they couldn't buy a fucking toaster.  they're broke, john. they're cold.  they're deadbeats, you can't judge on that.  even so. even so.  alright.  fine.  fine. even so.  i go in, four fucking leads they got their money in a sock.  they're fucking polacks, john.  four leads.  i close two. two.  fifty per...
...they kicked out.
they all kick out.  you run in streaks, pal.  streaks.  i'm... i'm...don't look at the board, look at me.  shelly levene.  anyone. ask them on western.  ask getz at homestead.  go ask jerry graff. you know who i am...i need a shot. i got to get on the fucking board. ask them.  ask them.  ask them who ever picked up a check i was flush. moss, jerry graff, mitch himself...those guys lived on the business i brought in.  they lived on it...and so did murray, john. you were here you'd of benefited from it too.  and now i'm saying this.  do i want charity?  do i want pity?  i want sits.  i want leads that don't come right out of a phone book.  give me a lead hotter than that, i'll go in and close it.  give me a chance. that's all i want.  i'm going to get up on that fucking board and all i want is a chance.  it's a streak and i'm going to turn it around.  i need your help.
why?
the leads are assigned randomly...
bullshit, bullshit, you assign them... what are you telling me?
...apart from the top men on the contest board.
then put me on the board.
you start closing again, you'll be on the board.
i can't close these leads, john. no one can.  it's a joke.  john, look, just give me a hot lead. just give me two of the premium leads.  as a "test," alright?  as a "test" and i promise you...
i can't do it, shel.
of what?
and what if you don't close.
i will close.
what if you don't close...?
i will close.
what if you don't?  then i'm fucked. you see...?  then it's my job. that's what i'm telling you.

no.
i'm asking you.  as a favor to me?  john.  john: my daughter...
i can't do it, shelly...
well, i want to tell you something, fella, wasn't long i could pick up the phone, call murray and i'd have your job.  you know that?  not too long ago.  for what?  for nothing. "mur, this new kid burns my ass." "shelly, he's out." you're gone before i'm back from lunch.  i bought him a trip to bermuda once...
i have to go...
wait.  alright.  fine.  the one.  give me the lead.  give me the one lead.  the best one you have.
i can't split them.
why?
because i say so.
is that it?  is that it?  you want to do business that way...?
you want to do business that way...? alright.  alright.  alright. alright.  what is there on the other list...?
you want something off the b list?
yeah.  yeah.
is that what you're saying?
that's what i'm saying.  yeah.  i'd like something off the other list.  which, very least, that i'm entitled to.  if i'm still working here, which for the moment i guess that i am.  what?  i'm sorry i spoke harshly to you.
that's alright.
the deal still stands, our other thing.
polacks and deadbeats.
...polacks...
deadbeats all.
...they hold on to their money...
all of 'em.  they, hey: it happens to us all.
where am i going to work?
you have to cheer up, george, you aren't out yet.
i'm not?
you missed a fucking sale.  big deal.  a deadbeat polack.  big deal. how you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
i had to.
you had to, yeah.  why?
to get on the...
to get on the board.  yeah.  how you goan'a get on the board sell'n a polack?  and i'll tell you, i'll tell you what else.  you listening? i'll tell you what else: don't ever try to sell an indian.
i'd never try to sell an indian.
you get those names come up, you ever get 'em, "patel?"
mmm...
you ever get 'em?
well, i think i had one once.
you did?
i...i don't know.
you had one you'd know it.  patel. they keep coming up.  i don't know. they like to talk to salesmen.  they're lonely, something.  they like to feel superior, i don't know.  never bought a fucking thing. you're sitting down "the rio rancho this, the blah blah blah," "the mountain view--" "oh yes.  my brother told me that..." they got a grapevine.  fuckin' indians, george. not my cup of tea.  speaking of which i want to tell you something:  i never got a cup of tea with them. you see them in the restaurants.  a supercilious race.  what is this look on their face all the time?  i don't know.  i don't know.  their broads all look like they just got fucked with a dead cat, i don't know.  i don't know.  i don't like it. christ...
what?
the whole fuckin' thing...the pressure's just too great.  you're ab...you're absolu...they're too important.  all of them.  you go in the door.  i..."i got to close this fucker, or i don't eat lunch," "or i don't win the cadillac..." we fuckin' work too hard.  you work too hard.  we all, i remember when we were at platt...huh?  glen ross farms... didn't we sell a bunch of that..."
they came in and they, you know...
well, they fucked it up.
they did.
they killed the goose.
they did.
and now...
we're stuck with this...
we're stuck with this fucking shit...
...this shit...
it's too...
it is.
eh?
it's too...
you get a bad month, all of a...
you're on this...
all of, they got you on this "board..."
i, i...i...
some contest board...
i...
it's not right.
it's not.
no.
and it's not right to the customers.
i know it's not.  i'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did i learn as a kid on western? don't sell a guy one car.  sell him five cars over fifteen years.
that's right?
eh...?
that's right?
goddamn right, that's right.  guys come on: "oh, the blah blah blah, i know what i'll do: i'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
...that's right...
eh?
no.  that's absolutely right.
and so they kill the goose.  i, i, i'll...and a fuckin' man, worked all his life has got to...
...that's right...
...cower in his boots...
shoes, boots, yes...
for some fuckin' "sell ten thousand and you win the steak knives..."
for some sales pro...
...sales promotion, "you lose, then we fire your..." no.  it's medieval... it's wrong. "or we're going to fire your ass." it's wrong.
yes.
yes, it is.  and you know who's responsible?
who?
you know who it is.  it's mitch. and murray.  'cause it doesn't have to be this way.
no.
look at jerry graff.  he's clean, he's doing business for himself, he's got his, that list of his with the nurses...see?  you see?  that's thinking.  why take ten percent?  a ten percent comm...why are we giving the rest away?  what are we giving ninety per...for nothing. for some jerk sit in the office tell you "get out there and close." "go win the cadillac." graff.  he goes out and buys.  he pays top dollar for the... you see?
yes.
that's thinking.  now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  he's...that's what i... that's thinking! "who?  who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"
nurses.
so graff buys a fucking list of nurses, one grand--if he paid two i'll eat my hat--four, five thousand nurses, and he's going wild...
he is?
he's doing very well.
i heard that they were running cold.
the nurses?
yes.
you hear a lot of things...he's doing very well.  he's doing very well.
with river oaks?
river oaks, brook farms.  all of that shit.  somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
himself?
that's what i'm saying.  why?  the leads.  he's got the good leads... what are we, we're sitting in the shit here.  why?  we have to go to them to get them.  huh.  ninety percent our sale, we're paying to the office for the leads.
the leads, the overhead, the telephones, there's lots of things.
what do you need? a telephone, some broad to say "good morning," nothing...nothing...
no, it's not that simple, dave...
yes.  it is.  it is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
what?
starting up.
what hard part?
of doing the thing.  the dif...the difference.  between me and jerry graff.  going to business for yourself.  the hard part is...you know what it is?
what?
just the act.
what act?
to say "i'm going on my own." 'cause what you do, george, let me tell you what you do: you find yourself in thrall to someone else. and we enslave ourselves.  to please.  to win some fucking toaster...to...to... and the guy who got there first made up those...
that's right...
he made up those rules, and we're working for him.
that's the truth...
that's the god's truth.  and it gets me depressed.  i swear that it does.  at my age.  to see a goddamn: "somebody wins the cadillac this month.  p.s. two guys get fucked."
huh.
you don't ax your sales force.
no.
you...
you...
you build it!
that's what i...
you fucking build it!  men come...
men come work for you...
...you're absolutely right.
they...
they have...
when they...
look look look look, when they build your business, then you can't fucking turn around, enslave them, treat them like children, fuck them up the ass, leave them to fend for themselves... no.  no.  you're absolutely right, and i want to tell you something.
what?
i want to tell you what somebody should do.
what?
someone should stand up and strike back.
what do you mean?
somebody...
yes...?
should do something to them.
what?
something.  to pay them back.  someone, someone should hurt them. murray and mitch.
someone should hurt them.
yes.
how?
how?  do something to hurt them. where they live.
what?
someone should rob the office.
huh.
that's what i'm saying.  we were, if we were that kind of guys, to knock it off, and trash the joint, it looks like robbery, and take the fuckin' leads out of the files...go to jerry graff.
what could somebody get for them?
what could we get for them?  i don't know.  buck a throw...buck-a- half a throw...i don't know...hey, who knows what they're worth, what do they pay for them?  all told...must be, i'd... three bucks a throw...i don't know.
how many leads have we got?
the glengarry...the premium leads...? i'd say we got five thousand.  five. five thousand leads.
and you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to jerry graff.
yes.
how do you know he'd buy them?
graff?  because i worked for him.
you haven't talked to him.
no.  what do you mean?  have i talked to him about this?
yes.  i mean are you actually talking about this, or are we just...
no, we're just...
we're just "talking" about it.
we're just speaking about it.  as an idea.
as an idea.
yes.
we're not actually talking about it.
no.
talking about it as a...
no.
as a robbery.
as a "robbery"?!  no.
well.  well...
hey.
so all this, um, you didn't, actually, you didn't go talk to graff.
not actually, no.
you didn't?
no.  not actually.
did you?
what did you say?
yes.  i said, "not actually." the fuck you care, george?  we're just talking...
we are?
because, because, you know, it's a crime.
that's right.  it's a crime.  it is a crime.  it's also very safe.
you're actually talking about this?
that's right.
you're going to steal the leads?
have i said that?
did i say that?
did you talk to graff?
is that what i said?
what did he say?
what did he say?  he'd buy them.
yes.
what will he pay?
a buck a shot.
for five thousand?
however they are, that's the deal. a buck a throw.  five thousand dollars.  split it half and half.
you're saying "me."
yes.  twenty-five hundred apiece.  one night's work, and the job with graff.  working the premium leads.
a job with graff.
is that what i said?
he'd give me a job.
he would take you on.  yes.
yes.  it is, george.  yes.  it's a big decision.  and it's a big reward.  it's a big reward.  for one night's work.  but it's got to be tonight.
what?
what?  what?  the leads.
you have to steal the leads tonight?
that's right, the guys are moving them downtown.  after the thirtieth. murray and mitch.  after the contest.
you're, you're saying so you have to go in there tonight and...
you...
i'm sorry?
you.
me?
you have to go in.  you have to get the leads.
yes.
i...
it's not something for nothing, george, i took you in on this, you have to go.  that's your thing. i've made the deal with graff.  i can't go.  i can't go in, i've spoken on this too much.  i've got a big mouth.  "the fucking leads" et cetera, blah blah blah "...the fucking tight ass company..."
they'll know when you go over to graff...
what will they know?  that i stole the leads?  i didn't steal the leads, i'm going to the movies tonight with a friend, and then i'm going to the como inn.  why did i go to graff?  i got a better deal. period.  let 'em prove something. they can't prove anything that's not the case.
dave.
yes.
you want me to break into the office tonight and steal the leads?
yes.
oh, yes, george.
what does that mean?
listen to this.  i have an alibi, i'm going to the como inn, why? why?  the place gets robbed, they're going to come looking for me.  why?  because i probably did it.  are you going to turn me in?  george?  are you going to turn me in?
what if you don't get caught?
they come to you, you going to turn me in?
why would they come to me?
they're going to come to everyone.
why would i do it?
you wouldn't, george, that's why i'm talking to you.  answer me. they come to you.  you going to turn me in?
no.
are you sure?
yes.  i'm sure.
then listen to this: i have to get those leads tonight.  that's something i have to do.  if i'm not at the movies...if i'm not eating over at the inn...if you don't do this, then i have to come in here...
...you don't have to come in...
...and rob the place...
...i thought that we were only talking...
...they take me, then.  they're going to ask me who were my accomplices.
me?
absolutely.
that's ridiculous.
well, to the law, you're an accessory.  before the fact.
i didn't ask to be.
then tough luck, george, because you are.
why?  why, because you only told me about it?
that's right.
why are you doing this to me, dave. why are you talking this way to me? i don't understand.  why are you doing this at all...?
that's none of your fucking business...
well, well, well, talk to me, we sat down to eat dinner, and here i'm a criminal...
you went for it.
in the abstract...
so i'm making it concrete.
why?
why?  why you going to give me five grand?
do you need five grand?
is that what i just said?
you need money?  is that the...
hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what i need is not the...what do you need...?
what is the five grand?  what is the, you said that we were going to split five...
i lied.  alright?  my end is my business. your end's twenty-five.  in or out. you tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
i do?
yes.
and why is that?
because you listened.
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  it gets so you don't mind it.  that's the worst thing that i can confess.  you know how long it took me to get there? a long time.  when you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  you think you're queer...? i'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  you think that you're a thief?  so what?  you get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  get shut of it.  shut it out.  you cheated on your wife...?  you did it, live with it.  you fuck little girls, so be it. there's an absolute morality?  may be.  and then what?  if you think there is, then be that thing.  bad people go to hell?  i don't think so.  if you think that, act that way.  a hell exists on earth?  yes. i won't live in it.  that's me. you ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?
did i...?
yes.
i don't know.
or a piss...?  a great meal fades in reflection.  everything else gains.  you know why? 'cause it's only food.  this shit we eat, it keeps us going.  but it's only food. the great fucks that you may have had.  what do you remember about them?
what do i...?
yes.
mmmm...
i don't know.  for me, i'm saying, what is is, it's probably not the orgasm.  some broads, forearms on your neck, something her eyes did. there was a sound she made...or, me, lying, in the, i'll tell you: me lying in bed; the next day she brought me café au lait.  she gives me a cigarette, my balls feel like concrete.  eh?  what i'm saying, what is our life?  it's looking forward or it's looking back.  and that's our life. that's it.  where is the moment?  and what is it that we're afraid of? loss.  what else?  the bank closes.  we get sick, my wife died on a plane, the stock market collapsed...the house burnt down...what of these happen...? none on 'em.  we worry anyway. what does this mean?  i'm not secure.  how can i be secure?  through amassing wealth beyond all measure?  no.  and what's beyond all measure?  that's a sickness. that's a trap.  there is no measure. only greed.  how can we act?
money?  if that's what it signifies to you. security?  comfort?  all it is is things that happen to you.  that's all it is.  how are they different?  some poor newly married guy gets run down by a cab.  some busboy wins the lottery.  all it is, it's a carnival.  what's special...what draws us?  we're all different.  we're not the same.  we are not the same.  hmmm.  it's been a long day.  what are you drinking?
gimlet.
well, let's have a couple more.  my name is richard roma, what's yours?
lingk.  james lingk.
james.  i'm glad to meet you.  i'm glad to meet you, james.  i want to show you something.  it might mean nothing to you...and it might not.
who used to say that?
in school.
williamson...williamson, they stole the contracts...?
excuse me, sir...
did they get my contracts?

"you do get the opportunity...you get them.  as i do, as anyone does..."
ricky?...that i don't care they stole the contracts?
i got 'em in the kitchen.  i'm eating her crumb cake.
what does that mean?
it means, dave, you haven't closed a good one in a month, none of my business, you want to push me to answer you.  and so you haven't got a contract to get stolen or so forth.
you have a mean streak in you, ricky, you know that...?
rick.  let me tell you.  wait, we're in the...
shut the fuck up.  ricky.  you have a mean streak in you...  and what the fuck are you babbling about...?
bring that shit up.  of my volume. you were on a bad one and i brought it up to you you'd harbor it.  you'd harbor it a long long while. and you'd be right.
who said "fuck the machine"?
"fuck the machine"? "fuck the machine"?  what is this.  courtesy class...?  you're fucked, rick--are you fucking nuts?  you're hot, so you think you're the ruler of this place...?!  you want to...
dave...
...shut up.  decide who should be dealt with how?  is that the thing? i come into the fuckin' office today, i get humiliated by some jagoff cop.  i get accused of...i get this shit thrown in my face by you, you geniune shit, because you're top name on the board...
is that what i did?  dave?  i humiliated you?  my god...i'm sorry...
sittin' on top of the world, sittin' on top of the world, everything's fucking peachfuzz...
oh, and i don't get a moment to spare for a bust-out humanitarian down on his luck lately.  fuck you, dave, you know you got a big mouth, and you make a close the whole place stinks with your farts for a week. "how much you just ingested," what a big man you are, "hey, let me buy you a pack of gum.
i'll show you how to chew it." your pal closes, all that comes out of your mouth is bile, how fucked up you are...
who's my pal...?  and what are you, ricky, huh, what are you, bishop sheean?  who the fuck are you, mr. slick...?  what are you, friend to the workingman?  big deal.  fuck you, you got the memory a fuckin' fly.  i never liked you.

i'm not going home.  i'm going to wisconsin.

and fuck you.  fuck the lot of you. fuck you all.
how was it...?
from the store.
fuck her...
"what we have to do is admit to ourself that we see that opportunity...and take it.  and that's it." and we sit there.  i got the pen out...
"always be closing..."
that's what i'm saying.  the old ways.  the old ways...convert the motherfucker...sell him...sell him... make him sign the check.  the...bruce, harriet...the kitchen, blah: they got their money in government bonds...i say fuck it, we're going to go the whole route. i plat it out eight units.  eighty- two grand.  i tell them. "this is now.  this is that thing that you've been dreaming of, you're going to find that suitcase on the train, the guy comes in the door, the bag that's full of money.  this is it, harriett..."
harriett...
bruce..."i don't want to fuck around with you.  i don't want to go round this, and pussyfoot around the thing, you have to look back on this.  i do, too.  i came here to do good for you and me.  for both of us.  why take an interim position?
the only arrangement i'll accept is full investment.  period.  the whole eight units.  i know that you're saying 'be safe,' i know what you're saying.  i know if i left you to yourselves, you'd say 'come back tomorrow,' and when i walked out that door, you'd make a cup of coffee...you'd sit down...and you'd think 'let's be safe...' and not to disappoint me you'd go one unit or maybe two, because you'd become scared because you'd met possibility.  but this won't do, and that's not the subject..." listen to this, i actually said this. "that's not the subject of our evening together." now i handed them the pen.  i held it in my hand. i turned the contract, eight units eighty-two grand. "now i want you to sign."  i sat there.  five minutes.  then, i sat there, ricky, twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  twenty-two minutes by the kitchen clock.  not a word, not a motion. what am i thinking? "my arm's getting tired?" no.  i did it.  i did it.  like in the old says, ricky.  like i was taught... like, like, like i used to do...i did it.
like you taught me...
bullshit, you're...no.  that's raw... well, if i did, then i'm glad i did.  i, well.  i locked on them.  all on them, nothing on me. all my thoughts are on them.  i'm holding the last thought that i spoke: "now is the time."  they signed, ricky.  it was great. it was fucking great.  it was like they wilted all at once.  no gesture...nothing.  like together.
ah, fuck.  leads!  leads! williamson!  send me out!  send me out!
the leads are coming.
get 'em to me!
i talked to murray and mitch an hour ago.  they're coming in, you understand they're a bit upset over this morning's...
did you tell 'em my sale?
how could i tell 'em your sale?  eh? i don't have a tel...i'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  alright?  shelly.  alright? we had a little... you closed a deal.  you made a good sale.  fine.
it's better than a good sale.  it's a...
look: i have a lot of things on my mind, they're coming in, alright, they're very upset, i'm trying to make some sense...
all that i'm telling you: that one thing you can tell them it's a remarkable sale.
the only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
what does that fucking mean?
that if the sale sticks, it will be a miracle.
why should the sale not stick? hey, fuck you.  that's what i'm saying.  you have no idea of your job.  a man's his job and you're fucked at yours.  you hear what i'm saying to you?  your "end of month board..." you can't run an office. i don't care.  you don't know what it is, you don't have the sense, you don't have the balls.  you ever been on a sit?  ever?  has this cocksucker ever been...you ever sit down with a cust...
i were you, i'd calm down, shelly.
would you?  would you...?  or you're gonna what, fire me?
it's not impossible.
on an eighty-thousand dollar day? and it ain't even noon.
you closed 'em today?
yes.  i did.  this morning.  what i'm saying to you: things can change.  you see?  this is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  you can't look down the road.  and see what's coming.  might be someone else, john.  it might be someone new, eh?  someone new.  and you can't look back. 'cause you don't know history.  you ask them.  when we were at rio rancho, who was top man?  a month...?  two months...? eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  you know what that means?  you know what that means? is that luck?  is that some, some, some purloined leads?  that's skill. that's talent, that's, that's...
...yes...
...and you don't remember. 'cause you weren't around.  that's cold calling.  walk up to the door.  i don't even know their name.  i'm selling something they don't even want.  you talk about soft sell... before we had a name for it...before we called it anything, we did it.
that's right, shel.
and, and, and, i did it.  and i put a kid through school. she...and...cold calling, fella. door to door.  but you don't know. you don't know.  you never heard of a streak.  you never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." what are you, you're a secretary, john.  fuck you.  that's my message for you.  fuck you and kiss my ass. you don't like it, i'll go talk to jerry graff.  period.  fuck you. put me on the board.  and i want three worthwhile leads today and i don't want any bullshit about them and i want 'em close together 'cause i'm going to hit them all today.  that's all i have to say to you.
he's right, williamson.
oh, christ.
the hell with him.  we'll go to lunch, the leads won't be up for...
you're a client.  i just sold you five waterfront glengarry farms.  i rub my head, throw me the cue "kenilworth."

which...
"home cooking"...what did you call it, you said it...it was a tag phrase that you had,,,

twelve-fifteen.
oh!  my god...i've got to get you on the plane!

oh, my god, you're right!  i'm on the one...  well, let's scoot...
i've got to talk to you...
i've got to get ray to o'hare...  come on, let's hustle...  john!  call american express in pittsburgh for mr. morton, will you, tell them he's on the one o'clock.

i'm sorry...?

oh, god...oh, god...  jim, excuse me...ray, i told you, who he is is the senior vice- president american express.  his family owns 32 per...over the past years i've sold him...i can't tell you the dollar amount, but quite a lot of land.  i promised five weeks ago that i'd go to the wife's birthday party in kenilworth tonight.  i have to go.  you understand. they treat me like a member of the family, so i have to go.
it's funny, you know, you get a picture of the corporation-type company man, all business...this man, no.  we'll go out to his home sometime.  let's see.  tomorrow.  no.  tomorrow, i'm in l.a....monday...i'll take you to lunch, where would you like to go?
my wife...
rick...?
i'm sorry, jim.  i can't talk now. i'll call you tonight...i'm sorry. i'm coming, ray.
my wife said i have to cancel the deal.
it's a common reaction, jim.  i'll tell you what it is, and i know that that's why you married her. one of the reasons is prudence. it's a sizable investment.  one thinks twice...it's also something women have.  it's just a reaction to the size of the investment. monday, if you'd invite me for dinner again...  this woman can cook...
rick...?
i'm coming, ray...what a day!  i'll call you this evening, jim.  i'm sorry you had to come in...monday, lunch.
monday.
she called the consumer...the attorney, i don't know.  the attorney gen...they said we have three days...
who did she call?
i don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
why did she do that, jim?
i don't know.  they said we have three days.  they said we have three days.
three days.
to...you know.
no, i don't know.  tell me.
to change our minds.
of course you have three days.
jim, jim, you saw my book...i can't, you saw my book...

three business days.  they mean three business days.
wednesday, thursday, friday.
i don't understand.
that's what they are.  three business...i wait till monday, my time limit runs out.
you don't count saturday.
i'm not.
no, i'm saying you don't include saturday...in your three days. it's not a business day.
but i'm not counting it.  wednesday.  thursday.  friday.  so it would have elapsed.
what would have elapsed?
if we wait till mon...
when did you write the check?
yest...
what was yesterday?
tuesday.
and when was that check cashed?
i don't know.
what was the earliest it could have been cashed?
today.  today.  which, in any case, it was not, as there were a couple of points on the agreement i wanted to go over with you in any case.
the check wasn't cashed?
i just called downtown, and it's on their desk.
rick...
one moment, i'll be right with you.  in fact, a...one point, which i spoke to you of which  i can't talk to you about here.
listen to me, the statute, it's for your protection.  i have no complaints with that, in fact, i was a member of the board when we drafted it, so quite the opposite. it says that you can change your mind three working days from the time the deal is closed.
levene!
which, wait a second, which is not until the check is cashed.
levene!!
...how can you talk to me that... that...
rick, i'm going to flag a cab.

that's what, that's what, that's what i was trying to do.  that's why i came in...i meet gestapo tac...
excuse me...
i meet gestapo tactics...i meet gestapo tactics...that's not right... no man has the right to..."call an attorney," that means you're guilt... you're under sus..."co...," he says, "cooperate" or we'll go downtown.  that's not...as long as i've...

mr. lingk and i are going to...
yes.  please.  please.  the police  can be...

it's nothing.
what are the police doing here...?
we had a slight burglary last night.
it was nothing...i was assuring mr. lingk...

john...
your contract went out to the bank.
...mr. williamson...
your check as cashed yesterday afternoon.  and we're completely insured, as you know, in any case.
you cashed the check?
not to my knowledge, no...
you stupid fucking cunt.  you, williamson...i'm talking to you, shithead...you just cost me six thousand dollars.  six thousand dollars.  and one cadillac.  that's right.  what are you going to do about it?  what are you goin to do about it, asshole. you fucking shit.  where did you learn your trade.  you stupid fucking cunt.  you idiot.  whoever told you you could work with men?
could i...
i'm going to have your job, shithead. i'm going downtown and talk to mitch and murrray, and i'm going to lemkin.  i don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  you're going out, i swear to you, you're going...
hey, fella, let's get this done...
anyone in this office lives on their wits...  i'm going to be with you in a second.  what you're hired for is to help us--does that seem clear to you?
mmm.
you can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed.  you hear me?  i'm talking to you. do you hear me...?
yes.  i hear you.
you can't learn that in an office. eh?  he's right.  you have to learn it on the streets.  you can't buy that.  you have to live it.
mmm.
yes.  mmm.  yes.  precisely. precisely. 'cause your partner depends on it.  i'm talking to you, i'm trying to tell you something.
you are?
yes, i am.
what are you trying to tell me?
what roma's trying to tell you. what i told you yesterday.  why you don't belong in this business.
why i don't...
you listen to me, someday you might say, "hey..." no, fuck that, you just listen what i'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
excuse me...
...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then i don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that...  you're scum, you're fucking white- bread.  you be as cold as you want. a child would know it, he's right.  you're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
how do you know i made it up?
what?
how do you know i made it up?
what are you talking about?
you said, "you don't make something up unless it's sure to help."  how did you know that i made it up?
what are you talking about?
i told the customer that his contracts had gone to the bank.
well, hadn't it?
no.  it hadn't.
don't fuck with me, john, don't fuck with me...what are you saying?
well, i'm saying this, shel: usually i take the contracts to the bank.  last night i didn't.  how did you know that?  one night in a year i left a contract on my desk. nobody knew that but you.  now how did you know that?  you want to talk to me, you want to talk to someone else...because this is my job.  this is my job on the line, and you are going to talk to me.  now how did you know that contract was on my desk?
you're so full of shit.
you robbed the office.
sure!  i robbed the office.  sure.
what'd you do with the leads?  you want to go in there?  i tell him what i know, he's going to dig up something...you got an alibi last night?  you better have one. what did you do with the leads?  if you tell me what you did with the leads, we can talk.
i don't know what you are saying.
if you tell me where the leads are, i won't turn you in.  if you don't, i am going to tell the cop you stole them, mitch and murray will see that you go to jail.  believe me they will.  now, what did you do with the leads?  i'm walking in that door--you have five seconds to tell me: or you are going to jail.
i...
i sold them to jerry graff.
how much did you get for them?  how much did you get for them?
five thousand.  i kept half.
who kept the other half?
do i have to tell you?  moss.
that was easy, wasn't it?
it was his idea.
was it?
i...i'm sure he got more than the five, actually.
uh-huh?
he told me my share was twenty-five.
mmm.
okay: i...look: i'm going to make it worth your while.  i am.  i turned this thing around.  i closed the old stuff, i can do it again. i'm the one's going to close 'em. i am!  i am! 'cause i turned this thing a...i can do that, i can do anyth...last night.  i'm going to tell you, i was ready to do the dutch.  moss gets me, "do this, we'll get well..." why not.  big fuckin' deal.  i'm halfway hoping to get caught.  to put me out of my...  but it taught me something.  what it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  big deal.  so i wasn't cut out to be a thief.  i was cut out to be a salesman.  and now i'm back, and i got my balls back...and, you know, john, you have the advantage on me now: whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  we're going to make it right.
i want to tell you something, shelly.  you have a big mouth.
what?
you've got a big mouth, and now i'm going to show you an even bigger one.
wait...uh, look...  look, twelve, twenty, two, twen... twenty-five hundred, it's...take it.  take it all...  take it!
no, i don't think so, shel.
i...
no, i think i don't want your money. i think you fucked up my office. and i think you're going away.
i...what?  are you, are you, that's why...?  are you nuts?  i'm...i'm going to close for you, i'm going to...  here, here, i'm going to make this office...i'm going to be back there number one...hey, hey, hey!  this is only the beginning...list...list... listen. listen.  just one moment. list...here's what...here's what we're going to do.  twenty percent. i'm going to give you twenty percent of my sales...  twenty percent.  for as long as i am with the firm.  fifty percent.  you're going to be my partner.  fifty percent.  of all my sales.
