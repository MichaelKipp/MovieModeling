don't test me, you wanna talk about what the law book says, we can do that, push me far enough and i'll take you to jail -- now calm down.
i am calm.
you're not calm.  you're screamin' and yellin' and i'm here to check on a disturbance that was reported and that's what i'm gonna do - now are you alone in here?
i don't have to answer your questions.
no you don't: but i'm gonna ask you one more time: are you alone in here?
what does it look like?
no one else in here?
you're here.
ok.  that's true.  is anyone else, besides me and besides you in this house?
no.  i said that.

you just woke up.  and what'd you have a party last night, the way this place looks?
i went out last night.
ok. marcie. starting now i want you to have a new attitude with me.  the more you play games, the more suspicious i'm gonna become that you've been up to something.
it's a free country, you can think anything you want.
yes i can, marcie.  and until you start givin' me some straight answers: i'm gonna assume that some mischief has been goin' on here.

what's this? what's this? god damn bullshit. bullshit. don't put those --
marcie - calm down. calm down and don't do this. i want you to stay --
this is the lapd. if anyone is back here i want you to come out and i want you to show yourself to me with your hands in the air --
there's no one in there. stay out of my motherfuckin bedroom.
this is the lapd, if anyone is in the closet i want you to come out and show yourself to me, slowly and with your hands up --
there's no one in there!
marcie - quiet down! now if anyone is in the closet, come out now --
there's no one in my motherfuckin closet and stay out of my bedroom, stay out of my god damn bedroom.
-- do not do this -- my gun is drawn and if i have to open that closet you will get shot -- step out now.
what the hell is this marcie?
that's not mine.
...no...no goddamn use.  i have a son, y'know?
you do?
...ah...
where is he?
i don't know...i mean, he's around, he's here, in town, y'know, but i don't know...he's a tough one...very.... do you have a girlfriend, phil?
no.
get a girlfriend.
i'm trying.
and do good things with her...share the thing...all that bullshit is true, y'know...find someone and hold on all that...where's linda?
she went out.  she said she went out to run some errands.  she'll be back.
she's a good girl.  she's a little nuts, but she's a good girl i think. she's a little daffy.
she loves you.
...ah...maybe...yeah...she's a good one...
when was the last time you talked to your son?
....i dunn...o....maybe ten...five, fuck, fuck....that's another thing that goes --
-- memory?
time lines, y'know?  i remember things but not so -- right there -- y'know?
yeah.
"yeah."  the fuck do you know?
i've seen it before.
other fuckin' assholes like me.
there's no asshole like you.
...cocksucker....
how come every word you say is either "cocksucker," or "shitballs," or "fuck?"
do me a personal favor --
go fuck myself?
you got it.
...i can't hold onto this anymore...
i'll get you another pain pill. another morphine pill --
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
who are you gonna call?
i wanna see this...where is he, do you know?
who?
jack.
is jack your son?
you wanna call him on the phone? we can call him, i can dial the phone if you can remember the number --
-- it's not him. it's not him. he's the fuckin' asshole...phil..c'mere...
this is so boring...so goddamn... and dying wish and all that, old man on a bed...fuck...wants one thing:
it's ok.
...find him on the...frank. his name's frank mackey --
frank mackey.  that's your son?
that'snotmy name...find lily, gimmme that, give it --
hello?
hi.  is frank there?
i think you have the wrong number.
i'm looking for frank mackey.
no.
is this 509-9027?
yeah.  you have the wrong number. there's no one named frank here.
alright.  thank you.
yep.
-- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, how can you tell me to calm down?
i can help you through this the best i know how but there are certain things you are gonna have to be strong about and take care of, now we can go over them, but i need to know that you're listening to me, ok?
i just, i just -- i just -- i'm just in a fucking state, i know he's going and it's like i don't know how -- just tell me <u>practical</u> things -- what the fuck do i do with his body? what happens when he dies? that next moment: what? what do i do?  then what?
well that's what hospice will take care of for you.  they will send a nurse, someone who can take care of all of that for you --
he has phil right now.
phil's one of the nurses from the service?
yeah.
if you're happy with phil taking care of him and helping you, that's fine, but contact hospice to arrange for the body --
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and i don't know if they're going down -- i can't see inside his mouth anymore -- i'm up all night staring at him and i don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
we can fix that, because i can give you -- are you listening?
i'm listening.  i'm getting better.
do you wanna sit down?
i need to sit down.
ok. linda:  earl is not gonna make it. he's dying. he is.  he is dying very, very rapidly --
this is the number for hospice. ok. now. as far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, i mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, linda.  i mean, any sign of the recognizable earl will pretty much go away --
-- how the fuck can i say anything to that -- i don't know what to say to that --
the job here is to make him as comfortable as possible -- right now -- our job is to just try and make it as painless as possible. right?  you understand?
hello?
hello.  is claudia here?
she's asleep.
are you her boyfriend?
you're jimmy gator, right?

no.  no.
what the fuck do you want?
i want to sit.  i want to talk to you.

...i want to....i want so many things, claudia. maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that i want to tell you --
i don't wanna talk to you.
please.  it doesn't have to be now. maybe we can make a date to sit down, i didn't mean to walk in on you like this --
why are you here, why are you doing this? coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
i don't want you to think that i'm that way to you -- i'm not gonna call you a slut or something --

i can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation i'm in, i don't -- avi: you know what?  being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? now solomon, let me just ask you once: please. please. don't do this.

just one look, one hesitation, one subtle gesture for me to know -- and bing-bam-boom i'm away on a tangent -- i get so fuckin' amped at these seminars and lemme tell you why: because i am what i believe. i am what i teach, i do as i say, i live by these rules as religiously as i preach them: and you wanna know what? i'm gettin' pussy left, right, up, down, center and sideways.
i'm gonna start rolling --
-- go, go, go.  i'm givin' pearls here. and i'ii tell you samethin' else: i'm not succeding in the bush because i'm frank tj mackey.  if anything, there are women out there that want to <u>destroy</u> me -- it makes it twice as hard for me, i run into some little muffin, knows who i am, knows my schemes and plans -- shit, she's gonna wanna fuck around, prove to her friends, say, "yaddda-yadda-yadda, i saw that guy, he wasn't anything, didn't get me."  so me? i'm runnin' on full throttle the whole fuckin' time.  dodging bullets left and right from terrorist blonde beauties. but i'ii tell you this: the battle of the bush is being fought and won by team mackey.  can i have a cigarette?
ok.  so, lemme just ask you a couple questions to start --
hello.  you're back again, huh?

it doesn't matter.
do you still have to do homework?
not as much as i used to.  ever since we started, i haven't really gone in to school that much because i've been getting more and more auditions --
i don't have regular classes anymore.
what do you do?
they just let me have my own study-time, my own reading time in the library.
that's pretty cool.
do you have an agent, stanley?
no.
you should get one, i'm serious, you could get a lot of stuff out of this --
like what?
what do you mean, "like what?" -- you could get endorsments and shit --
-- richard.
bite it, cynthia.  you could get free things from people that want you to endorse their products.
commercials, a sitcom, an mow or something.
what's mow?
movie of the week.  i went up for one this morning with alan thicke and corey haim --
was it a call back?
no.  but i probably will get a call back.
if we beat the record, you might get a call back --
i'll get it because i'm a good actress, richard.
saucy-saucy.
c'mon guys, settle down --
cynthia?
what?
how much time do we have?
not enough, what do you want?
i should maybe go to the bathroom.
can you hold it?
i don't know.
just hold it, you'll be fine.
they look pretty smart, i think.
no they don't --
what are they gonna do -- beat us?
maybe.
we're not going out two days before we set the record, it's not gonna happen.
when they want us done, they'll call in the harvard s.w.a.t team or some shit.
you look great.
what the fuck is this, jimmy?
...you know...
did your wife find out?
no.
then what?
it's just...too late for me to be fuckin' around.  i gotta stop. i gotta clean my brain of all the shit i've done that i shouldn't have done --
-- that you shouldn't have done? that you regret, what? this? what's this? fuck, man, c'mon.  treat me like an asshole, but treat me like an <u>asshole</u>.
i don't wanna have to lie to anyone. i don't want to hurt anyone else, anymore.
thirty fuckin' years i've been with rose, don't -- y'know -- with this, and i know what you think --
all your other fluzzies?
yeah. yes.
you're making me feel so dirty and shitty. i feel like a big piece of shit right now.
are you gonna tell her what you've done?
yes.
will you say my name?
if she asks me any question i want to tell her.  i want to tell her everything i've done.
well can you do me one favor and don't do that.
come and tell me it's over and i'll walk away, jimmy.  i've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- i'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle --
i won't.

yeah, but i don't know --
-- listenin' to that music so loud: you tryin' to damage your ears?
no.
well if you keep listenin' to the music that loud you're not only gonna damage your ears but your neighbors ears.
i didn't realize it was that loud.
and that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
yeah.
you got the tv on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
no.
i got a call of a disturbance, screaming and yelling, loud music.  has there been some screaming and yelling?
yes.  i had someone come to my door, someone i didn't want here and i told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. they left.  i'm sorry.

i'm a bit of a slob myself.
yeah.

i don't have a boyfriend.
you look like you've got money in your pocket.
maybe i'm just happy to see my friend, brad there.
just throw some money around. money, money, money.
this sounds threatening.
do you have love in your heart?
i have love all over.  i even have love for you, friend.
is it real love?
well --
-- the kind of love that makes you feel that intagible joy.  pit of your stomach. like a bucket of acid and nerves running around and making you hurt and happy and all over you're head over heels....?
well you lost me with the last couple of cocktail words spoken, m'boy, but i believe it's that sort of love. sounds nice to me.
i have love.
a very chatty-kind, you do, indeed, it seems.
no.  i mean, i'm telling you: i'm telling you that i have love.

well i don't want to order anything, you see. i have a situation, a situation just come up that's really pretty serious and i'm not sure who i should talk to or what i should do but could you maybe put me in touch with the right person if i explain myself?
i'm really only equipped to take orders --
well can you connect me to someone else?
well what's the situation?
well, ok.  lemme see how i explain this without it seeming kinda crazy, but here go:  i'm, my name is phil parma and i work for a man named earl partridge -- mr. earl partidge. i'm his nurse.  he's a very sick man. he's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find his son -- hello?  are you there, hello?
i'm here, i'm listening.
ok.  see:  frank tj macky is earl partridge's son....
where are you from originally?
around here.
the valley?
hollywood, mainly.
and what did your parents do?
my father worked in televison. my mother -- this is gonna sound silly to you -- she was a librarian.
why does that sound silly?
well i guess it doesn't.
does you mother still work?
she's retired.
are you close?
she's my mother.
what does she say about, "seduce and destroy."
"go get 'em, honey."
and your father?
he passed away.
i'm sorry.
people die.
i wouldn'tve asked --
not a problem.
and you ended up at uc berkely --
from '84 to '89.
psychology major?
right.
do you have your masters?
...this close...
in five years?
cats and dogs out there, huh?
mmmhmm.
must have alot goin' on for all that stuff you got back there, eh?  you could have quite a party all that stuff....
you been on prozac long?  dexadrine?
...i don't....
you motherfucker...you motherfucker.... you fucking asshole, who the fuck are you? who the fuck do you think you are?
-- what-what-what, ma'am -- i --
i come in here - you don't know, you don't know who the fuck i am or what my life is and you have the fucking balls, the <u>indecency</u> to ask me a question about my life --
why don't they have the same last name? they don't have the same last name.
i know -- and i can't really explain that, but i have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
uh-huh.
does this sound weird?
well i'm not sure why you're calling me.
there's no number for frank in any of earl's stuff and he's pretty out of it -- i mean, like i said, he's dying, y'know.  dying of cancer.
what kind of cancer?
brain and lung.
my mother had breast cancer.
it's rough.  i'm sorry, did she make it?
oh, she's fine.
oh that's good.
it was scary though.
it's a helluva disease.
sure is.  so why call me?
-- see, i thought you grew up here in the valley --
like i said, yeah --
and you went to van nuys high, right?
i don't how much i went -- but i was enrolled.  i was such a loser back then. i was -- misguided, pathetic -- i was very fat. not even close to what i am today. not the frank tj mackey you're eager to talk to because i was swimming in what <u>was</u> as opposed to i <u>wanted</u>.
where does that name come from?
what name?  my name?
it's not your given name, right?
my mother's name, actually. good question.  you've done you're research.
and "frank?"
"frank" was my mother's father.
ok.  that's why.  i had trouble locating your school records at berkely and ucla. your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
oh, yeah.  no, no, no.  they wouldn't --
they wouldn't?
no, no, no.  certainly not.  i wasn't officialy enrolled, that's right. was that unclear?
kind of.
i wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: my enrollment was totally unoffical because i was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  but there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: macready, horn and langtree among others. i was completely independent financially, and like i said: one sad sack a shit. so what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and i think that's what most people respond to in "seduce," and at the end of the day? hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding what you can be in this world.  defining it.  controling it and saying: i will take what is mine.  you just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
got some coffee brewing, huh?
yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
i like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, i enjoy a warm cup --
-- do you wanna cup?
that's great, thank you.
i don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
oh, it'll be fine, i'm sure, claudia.
you take cream or sugar?
that'd be fine.  so, claudia, lemme just say, so i can get my role of lapd officer out of the way before we enjoy our coffee  i'm not gonna write you up or anything, i'm not gonna give you a citation here -- but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud:  they're incovenienced by that.  if you had a job you'd probably understand, but i see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that -- if it's the middle of the day -- that's what i do -- just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? i see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?
yeah.
arlight, then.  cheers.
is this boyfriend bothering you?
i don't have a boyfriend.
the gentleman who came to the door --
-- is not my boyfriend.
many times, in damestic abuse situations the young lady is afraid to speak, but i have to tell you that, being a police officer, i've seen it happen: young woman afraid to speak, next thing you know, i'm gettin' a call on the radio, i got a 422 --
it's not -- what's a 422?
it's where situations like these lead, claudia, unless you do something about it early, if and when the police call and come for help.  now there are certain measures you can take --
it's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over.  really. it's not.  he won't came back.
i don't wanna have to come back here in an hour and find that there's been another disturbance.
you won't.  you won't have to.
but i wouldn't mind comin' back in an hour just to see your pretty face!
i'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.
okey-doke.
i can't fuckin' do this.
are you alright?
fuck.  i think i'm gonna throw up, i think.  i haven't thrown up since i was twenty years old.
i have to go to the bathroom, cynthia.
jesus christ, stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  you have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is not the time to go to the bathroom.
i'm, i need to go, i'm gonna --
hey, janet, it's chad.
what's wrong?
nothing's wrong, i just got some guy on the phone on my other line, he's says he works for this guy, this guy who's frank's father --
-- no,no,no what is this? who? what's this guy's name?
yeah, hey. chad.
alright, so i'm gonna transfer you over to frank's assitant, janet she's gonna see what she can do --
thank you, chad, and good luck to you and your mother --
thank you.  thank you very much.
hello?
ok. janet you have phil parma --
hello, phil.
....do you know who i am?
you're a friend of the family i presume?
what?  what does that mean?
nothing special, just a spoke in the wheel.
you talk in rhymes and riddles and ra...rub-adub --- but that doesn't mean anything to me, see....see...see i used to be smart....i'm quiz kid donnie smith. i'm quiz kid donnie smith from the tv --
might of been before my time.
but you're alright now, so what's the what?
what?
that's right.
i used to be smart but now i'm just stupid.
brad, dear?
who was it that said: "a man of genius has seldom been ruined but by himself."
-- samuel johnson.
it was the lovely samuel johnson who also spoke of a fella "who was not only dull but a cause of dullness in others."
"the" cause of dullness in others --
picky, picky.
-- and lemme tell you this: samuel johnson never had his life shit on and taken from him and his money stolen -- who took his life and his money?  his parents? his mommy and daddy?  make him live this life like this -- "a man of genius" gets shit on as a child and that scars and it hurts and have you ever been hit by lighting? it hurts and it doesn't happen to everyone, it's an electrical charge that finds it's way across the universe and lands in your body and your head -- and as for "ruined but by himself," not if his parents take his friggin' life and his money and tell you to do this and do that and if you don't? well, what --
things go round 'n round, don't they?
yes they do, they do, but i'll make my dreams come true, you see?  i will.
this sounds sad as a weeping willow.
i used to be smart but now i'm just stupid.
shall we drink to that?
"if a brick weighs one pound plus one half brick -- how much does the brick weigh?" "well if subtracting the half of brick from the whole brick you got one half of brick, equals one pound so therefore the brick equals two pounds --" "a little more than kin and less than kind," is hamlet to claudius. "the sins of the father laid upon the children," is merchant of venice but borrowed from exodus 20:5 and "win her with gifts if she respects not words," is two gentleman from verona. where? who? how and why, kids?
"why don't you shut the fuck up," is me to you, chapter right here, verse right now.
what were you saying, stanley?
i was saying...thinking maybe i'd get my own quiz show someday, jimmy. just like you!
-- that's right, that's right, and what i'm saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  that there is no need for insight or understanding.  things of the past! gone, over, done. do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? how fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  i'm talking about eliminating <u>insight</u> and <u>understanding</u> as human values.  god damn i'm good.  there is no need for insight.  there is no need for understanding.  i have found a way to take <u>any</u> subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  the "listener-patient"  settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: not a trance, mind you, but a state. a state that is brand new.  the system's state. what did i do?  i realized that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. i'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.  i'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail --
let's talk about --
i just realized this is for television, isn't it?  i can't swear up and down like i just did.
it's fine.  i can bleep it out.
i warned you -- i get on a roll...
-- let's talk more about your background --
muffy -- coffee?
i'm confused about your past is the thing.
is that still lingering?
-- just to clarify --
so boring, so useless --
i would just want to clear some things up:
thank you, muffy.  funny thing is: this is an important element of, "seduce and destory:" "facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something i tell my men over and over --
this isn't meant --
-- and i try and teach the students to ask: what is it in aid of?
are you asking me that?
yes.
well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
in aid of what?
i'm saying, frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
-- there's a lot more important things i'd like to put myself <u>into</u> --
it's all important --
not really.
it's not like i'm trying to attack you --
this is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "the most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," chapter three --
we talked earlier about your mother. and we talked about your father and his death. and i don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but i have to ask and i would want to clarify something -- something that i understand --
i'm not sure i hear a question in there?
do you remember a miss simms?
i know alotta women and i'm sure she remembers me.
she does.  from when you were a boy.
mm. hm.
she lived in tarzana.
an old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, i figured this was coming sooner or later -- is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
no, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
go ahead and waste your time.
i was told that your mother died. that your mother died when you were young --
and that's what you've heard?
i talked to miss simms.  miss simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
are you asking me a question?
well i guess the question is this: do you remember miss simms?
you don't want any water?
no...i just... i'm so fucked up here alan, i don't know...there's so much...so many things --
are you on drugs right now?
if i talk to you...y'know...if i tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? you can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? attornery-client, you understand?
not exactly, linda. i'm not sure where you're going with this --
like a shrink, like if i go to see a shrink, i'm protected, i can say things -- fuck -- i don't know what i'm doing --
linda, you're safe.  ok. it's alright. you're my friend.  you and earl are my clients and what you need to talk about won't leave this room, you have something you have to say --
-- i have something to tell you. i have to tell you something. i want to change his will, can i change his will?...i need to ---
you can't change his will.  only earl can change his will.
no, no....no, you see...i never loved him. i never loved him, earl.  when i started, when i met him, i met him and i fucked him and i married him because i wanted his money, do you understand?  i'm telling you this now...this i've never told anyone...i didn't love him. and now....i know i'm in that will, i know, i was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money i'ii get -- i don't want it -- because i love him so much now...i've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and i look at him and he's about to go, alan, he's dead...he's moments...  i took care of him through this, alan. and what now then?
i don't want him to die, i didn't love him when we met, and i've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things i want to confess to him, but now i do: i love him. i love him so much and i can't stand -- he's going.
what kind of medication are you on right now, linda that's --
this is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- i don't know. i don't know -- can you give me nothing? you have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- i don't want any money, i couldn't live with myself, this thing i've done -- i've fucking done so many bad things -- i fucked around.  i fucked around on him, i fucking cheated on him, alan. you're his lawyer, our laywer, there, i'm his wife, we are married. i broke the conract of marriage, i fucking cheated on him, many times over, i sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... other things i've done..
adultery isn't illegal -- it's not something that can be used in a court to discredit the will or -- linda. linda. calm down.
i can't.
you don't have to change the will, if what you want to do is get nothing you can renounce the will when it's time.
where will the money go?
well.  considering that there's no one else mentioned in the will...we'd have to go to the laws of intestacy, which is -- as if someone died without a will --
what does that mean?
the money would go to frank.  the court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
-- that can't happen.  earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
-- unless frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
this is so over-the-top and fucked-up i can hardly stand it.
linda, you just have to take a moment and breath and one thing at a time --
shut the fuck up.
i'm trying to help, linda --
shut the fuck up. shut the fuck up.
you need to sober up.
now you must really shut the fuck up, please. shut the fuck up.
linda --
i have to go.
let me call you a car, linda.
shut the fuck up.
ok, ok. i'm back.
this is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, claudia --
thank you.
did you piss your fuckin' pants, stanley?
shut up -- shut up --
what happend, what's going on?
nothing. nothing happend. go away.
don't tell me to go away, stanley. i am the co-ordinator in this show and you will answer the questions that i ask, you understand?
what's the problem, what's the problem here?
i'm fine. nothing.
why didn't you answer those questions?
i didn't know the answer --
bullshit.  bullshit. you know the answer to every goddamn question and i knew the answer to those questions and i'm not half as smart as you are so what happened?
i don't know.
i didn't i'm fine, i'm fine.
stand up.
i said i'm fine.
...oh jesus, what the fuck...?
i'm fine. i'm fine, i just wanna keep playing --
why did you do this?
call 911. call 911 right now.
no, no, no. i'm fine. it's small, i wanna keep going --
no, no, c'mon jimmy we need to call this quits and you need to see a doctor.
i'm telling you right now, i'm fine. i lost my goddamn balance and i couldn't see a moment, but i'm ok.
call 911, mary, do it right now.
you fuckin' don't do that. you don't do it, you cocksucker. i'll fuckin' kill you with my barehands.  go. get the fuck fuck -- we're going back and we finish the show --
jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
shut it.  shut yer fuckin' mouth.
are we gonna keep going with this game?
yes.
you're two fuckin' days from the record, get through this and i'ii do anything for you, you just gotta get through this --
alright.
hang in there, ok. i love you.
--- yeah, yeah, i get in it in my ear. it's tmj is what it's called technically.
what's that stand for?
tempural-something-mandibular, thing with something, i dunno. but it affects my ear, i don't even know if i have tmj exactly but just very tight, like - it's like a muscle spasm and it's just gets so clenched --
this is my job.
we were just gettin' warmed up. we were just getting started.
well if you listen' to that music too loud again and that fella returns maybe we'll share another cup of coffee --
if you're not here for a 422 --
no. no.  don't joke about that. that's not funny, claudia.  please, now.
i'm sorry.
ok, then.  keep your chin up and your music down, alright?
yes.  i will.  it was nice to meet you officer jim.
just jim.
yeah, good, ok.
bye, bye, claudia.
good bye.
i'm sorry, claudia.
what is it?  did you forget something?
no, no.  i was wondering...man oh man. i think i feel like a bit of a scum-bucket doing this, considering that i came here as an officer of the law and the situation and all this but i think i'd be a fool if i didn't do something i really want to do which is to ask you on a date.
you wanna go on a date with me?
please, yes.
well...is that illegal?
no.
then...i'd like to go...what do you want to do?
i don't know.  i haven't thought about it -- you know what -- that's not true -- i have thought about it.  i've thought about going on a date with you since you opened the door.
really?
yeah.
i thought you were flirting with me a little.
do you wanna go tonight?  i mean, are you working?
no, i'm off tonight.  i would lov-like, to go tonight, i can pick you up, i can pick you up here at about what time?  what time?
eight o'clock?
what about ten o'clock, is that too late?  i don't get off and then --
oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good.  should i get dressed up or -- ?
no, no, just casual maybe, maybe i thought -- there's a spot i like to go, it's real nice that overlooks a golf course and the course is lit up at night --
billingsley's?
yeah, you know it? you know billingsley's?
it's my favorite place --
oh, see?  this is great.  ten o'clock.
great, bye.
bye.

i don't wanna do it.  why can't one of you do it --
stanley if you don't fuckin' stand up and go over there i'm gonna beat your ass --
i'm sick of being the one, the one who always has to do everything, i don't want to be the one always --
i confuse melancholy and depression sometimes....
mmm.hmm.
you see?
why don't you run along now friend, your dessert is getting cold.
i'm sick.

i'm sick and i'm in love.
you seem the sort of person who confuses the two.

i love you.  i love you and i'm sick.  i'ii talk to you....i'll talk to you tommorrow.  i'm getting corrective oral surgery tomorrow.  for my teeth.  for my teeth and for you....for you so we can speak. you have braces.  me too.  me too.  i'm getting braces, too.  for you.  for you, dear brad. and i don't have any money.  and i don't have any money now but i'ii get it...i will for you, brad.  i love you, brad.  brad the bartender.  you wanna love me back?  love me back and i'll be good to you.  i'ii be god damn good for you. and i won't be mad if you don't know who said what. i won't punish you if you get the answer wrong. i can teach and tell you: samuel johnson.
brad, honey, you have a special secret crush over here i think, don't take him too lovely -- he might get hurt --
you mind your own bussines.
gently, son --
brad, i know you don't love me now --
"it's a dangerous thing to confuse chidlren with angels..."
-- and you wanna know the common element for the entire group, like he asks...i'll tell you the answer: i'll tell you, 'cause i had that question.  i had that same question....carbon. in pencil led, it's in the form of graphite and in coal, it's all mixed up with other impurities and in the diamond it's in hard form.  "well...all we were asking was the common element, donnie...but thank you for all that unnecessary knowledge...ahhh, kids!  full of useless thoughts, eh?"  thank you. thank you.  and the book says: "we may be through with the past but the past is not through with us."  and no it's not dangerous to do that.

so you sat it out, that's what you did?
you requested my time and i gave it you, you called me a liar and made accusations. and you say, "if i'd known i wouldn't have asked," then it's not an attack?  well, i don't wanna be the sort of fella who doesn't keep his word.  i gave you my time, bitch. so fuck you now.
you're hurting a lot of people, frank --
-- fuck you.
we are not on display.  i am not a doll. i am not a doll...i' m not silly and cute. i'm smart so that shouldn't make me something, something so people can watch how silly it is that he's smart?  i know.  i know things. i know. i have to go to the bathroom i have to go to the bathroom and i have to go.

i've heard your tapes on the phone.

when they put me on hold, to talk to you...they play the tapes. i mean: i'd seen the commercials and heard about you, but i'd never heard the tapes ....
uh. huh.
it's interesting.
mmm.
i don't think i want that.
it'll take the pain away.
it's not really pain.
how do we do this, then?
we just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, i guess...
do you love me, rose?
you're my handsome man.
i'm a bad person.
no.  no.
no, i mean:  i'm telling you this, now. you see?  you see i want to make everything clear and clean...and apologize for me....for all the stupid things i've done....that will eat me up....
you feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins?  honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
--- don't.  don't.  please.  just... listen to me...honey....  ...i've done...i've cheated on you.
...no...i don't hate you.  do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, jimmy?
yeah.
the question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
will that help?
yeah.
did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  they want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
so you've done it --
well i don't go out very much.
why not?
i've never found someone really that i think i would like to go out with.
and i bet you say that to all the girls --
no, no.
you wanna make a deal with me?
ok.
what i just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
...yeah...
to not do that.  to not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
let's make a deal.
ok.  i'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
wow....huh..."...piss and shit..."
what?
you really use strong language.
i'm sorry --
-- no, no, it's fine. fine.
i didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, i know --
it's fine.
i'm sorry.
...nothing.  i'm sorry...
no, i'm sorry.  i'm saying i'm sorry. i talk like a jerk sometimes --
-- well i'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words i just don't use much --
i'm sorry.
i'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
ok.
ok.
so....phil....um...i think i'm gonna step in and try and see him and say something if he can...talk...i mean:
...ok...
can you stand...back...maybe, i mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
yeah.
how many times....it's ok...just say... just say...
i don't even remember...many...twenty... maybe more...not much more...twenty times.
i don't hate you, jimmy.  but i have a couple questions that i wanna ask....
i'll answer anything.
was there anyone that i know?
yes.

no one else that i know?
no.
how long with ellen?

how long with paula?
two years...three years...
what about now?
it's over.  i talked to her this morning.
is it over 'cause you're sick?
it's over becuase...for all the the right reasons i hope, what i said.
do you have any children with anyone?
what? no, rose, jesus, no --
well maybe.
i don't.
do you feel better now that you've said this?
i don't know....
i'm not mad.  i am, but i'm not.  y'know?
i love you so much.
i'm not through asking my questions.
why doesn't claudia talk to you, jimmy?
why, well i think we've, we both don't know...what do you mean?
i think that you know.
maybe...i don't...
hi.
hi.
..sorry...
it's ok.
well.
that felt good to do...to do what i wanted to do.
yeah.
can i tell you something?
yeah, of course.
i'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon.  that you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
-- no, like what, what do you mean?
you're a police officer.  you have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
i lost my gun.
what?
i lost my gun after i left you today and i'm the laughing stock of a lot of people.  i wanted to tell you that. i wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and i feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and i'll tell you that, this: that i lost my gun and i'm not a good cop...and i'm looked down at...and i know that....and i'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
oh my god, jim. jim, that was so --
i'm sorry --
that was so great what you just said.
i haven't been on a date since i was married and that was three years ago....and claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and i will listen...i will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...i won't judge you.... i can do that sometimes, i know, but i won't...i can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think i'll think or on and on and just say it and i'll listen to you....
you don't how fuckin' stupid i am.
it's ok.
you don't know how crazy i am.
it's ok.
i've got troubles.
i'll take everything at face value. i'll be a good listener to you.
ohhhh i started this, didn't i, didn't i, didn't i, fuck.
say what you want and you'll see --
wanna kiss me, jim?
yes i do.
hi.
hi.
..sorry...
it's ok.
...say it, jimmy...
do you know the answer to this?
i'm asking you.  i'm asking you if you know why clauida will not speak to you....please, jimmy....tell me.
i think that she thinks i may have molested her.
she thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that i might have done something.  she said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "you touched me wrong..." "i know that." some crazy thought in her, in her head...
did you ever touch her?
...no....
jimmy, did you touch her?
i don't know.
...jimmy...
i really don't know.
but you can't say....
<u>i don't know what i've done</u>.

you deserve to die alone for what you've done.
i don't know what i've done.
yes you do.
stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if i said i knew would you stay?
no.
i don't know what i've done.
you should know better.
....now that i've met you.... would you object to never seeing me again?
what?
just say no.
i won't say, no, wait, claudia --
let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please.
please, what is it, please --
just let me walk out, ok?

...just wait...dad...you want something...can you say...
....you have it...easy....you know? you have a father who loves you, huh?
yes.
you know what it's like to come home scared, scared that maybe if you don't have the money you're supposed to go out each day and get that you're gonna get beaten....by a belt...he hits me with a belt, stanley....  i'm supposed to sell those candy bars, and if i don't, i come home without the money....
