it is warmer than i thought.
you want to go to a movie tonight?
i thought your mom's coming up?
so?
my parents are having friends from college over. they are really nice... they have this gorgeous son who wants to be a forest ranger.
can i come? I will start a fire...
it is me.
hi.
hi.
so, what, uh, what train are you taking?
i should be in by two.
okay. you want me to pick you up?
sure... what is grace up to?
riding with judith.
I am sorry about last night. i should not have brought it up over the phone.
that is okay. we have to talk about it and we are not always in the same place ... so... i just have to get used to it.  what do you want to do about dinner?
i do not know. we will figure it out.
okay. we will see you later then.
yeah. bye.
...oh, come on! you think the same thing!
i just could never say it!
do you want to go around by the old road?
why do not we just cut through the woods?
you want to go down or stay along the river?
we already did the river. let's go down and across the old bridge. we can circle back.
david?
who is there?
everyone. working overtime. just for you.
did you speak to farlow?
yes. we are suing.
is that absolutely necessary? it will just make it a bigger story.
david, he signed an agreement that he would not talk to the press and he is libeled me by saying i faked the figures. you are not going soft on me, are you?
well, i suppose we could use another good public feud...
exactly...
"... and i said that"...
no, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
jude, you okay?
I am okay... I am okay.
what about grace?
she was in pretty bad shape. they have done a c.a.t. scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
that bag's almost empty.
no, it is got a little left. they will be in to change it.
robert, you leave it up these people...!
I am sorry.
tch. what are you --
annie, it is liz. how is grace?
her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. she had some bleeding but it is under control.
oh god, annie, I am so sorry. i... i know you are being hit with a low now, i do not want to take too much of your time but i have to talk to you about pilgrim.
wait, uh, i, i do not understand. start again -- he is alive...
yes, but he is in a tremendous pain...
well, of course, right...
liz, listen, the doctor's here and i just can't, uh... talk now... so --
i understand, but annie, please...
- see, what you can do for him --...
annie, no matter what i do, this horse will never be the same.
... i just do not know right now! do whatever you can and when grace is --
it is not right to make him suffer...
and i can say the same thing about my daughter! but she is suffering! can you solve that problem!  i can not deal with this now, liz! if you need a yes or no right now, then no -- do not do it! not until i know grace is all right. now, please! just do what you can. okay?  please.
what did he say?
nothing new. he is just going off duty.
i should go get some of her things.
no, let me go.
no, I will go. you stay... in case she wakes up.
i saw judith's parents while you were at the apartment...  i wanted to say something...  but i... i was so relieved that grace was still... that it was not our daughter.
we are very lucky.
the funeral's on friday.
oh, uh, i meant to tell you... alex brought that fabric over...
okay.
it is on the table by the phone. i did not know what to tell him...  ... whether or not we were...  ... if we still we are thinking of redoing the couch.
... and uh... mario called about moving the wisteria?
oh. right. I will call him.
"... fresh, wind in her hair... life without care... she is broke... but it is 'ok'...
sing it to me, frankie!
how is my pregnant chick!
you can hardly get your arms around me. how depressing. you are so early.
i had to excuse myself from a meeting. it is ridiculous. i kept thinking about the baby... you... and, i swear, i was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
aw... that is so sweet.
i love you.
do you? do you really?
have you heard from judith's parents?
no, not yet.
how is pilgrim doing?
liz is taking care of him.  the doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
i can not even get out of bed yet! you are already putting me in therapy!!
dad! i can do it, ok?!
ok, ok.
do you want something else, honey? we order something else?
no, I am just not that hungry.
why do not you go lie down?
i do not want to lie down. I have been lying down enough.
you want to watch some television?
maybe... look -- just...
you have got to stop doing that?
doing what?
helping all the time! running to her every time she trips or falls... anticipating her all the time.
honey, you all right? did something fall?
no!
dad'll pick you up today, all right?
okay.
oh, honey... what happened?
does not matter. i... i do not want to come back, that is all.
oh. well, what are you going to do? you have to go to school, honey. i mean, what --
I am not coming back! that is it! i want to go home!
grace, listen to me. your body is just healing. you have to give the rest of you time as well...
is that your version of a pep talk?
you are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. you are going to get up and you are going to figure this out.
fine!
it is still early. what is your next class?
what, sweetheart?
i want to see pilgrim.
hey, darlin'.
hey, rona. sorry I am late.
i would not know what to do if you were on time.
you are looking fit.
fit? you want to check my teeth.  good crowd today. i think you will have some fun. you going to stay for dinner?
if it is not too much trouble, i thought i might.
kind of trouble I am in the mood for.
oh-oh... maybe i better get back in the truck.
well, that will happen.
where did you learn all this stuff?
what stuff is that?
about horses? I would love to learn more about it myself. do you offer any private lessons for riders?
well... dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
what do you mean?
well, if the rider's nuts, the horse bolts.  that is the whole lesson right there. you have a good day now... just... keep on freeing yourself up.
oh i clear forget. you had a call from some woman in new york. she sounded pretty wound up.
i do not any woman in new york. but from what i hear, most of them are wound up.
the number's by the phone.
what are you looking at, young man?
how long were you married?
long enough.
you ever miss it?
does a horse miss a saddle?
sometimes.
you know, rona, we were not all that good together even when we were good together.
honey... i was always good.
this is annie maclean.
yeah. hello. this is tom booker. i got a message you called.
i went on the internet and found this article about you... it says you are a horse whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. and you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --
well, see, truth is, ma'am, i help horses with people's problems.
well, you know, however you want to put it -- i got your information from the publisher of the article. i called montana and your sister-in-law, i think, gave me this number.  I am been hot on your trail you could say because i was hoping you would consider coming to new york and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --
ma'am, I am very sorry about your problems and i appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I am afraid you have misunderstood whatever it is you read. i do not do that sort of thing.
well, if you could just come for the day. new york's only a few hours by plane, I would have you home by dinner...
look, even if it was nearer, that is just not what i do. i give clinics. and I am not even doing them for a while. I am heading back to montana right now. i got a ranch to take care of...
I will pay you for your fare. I will send you to montana first class.
ma'am, first class to montana is a waste of good money. now, am i being too polite here or when i say no in utah, does that mean yes in new york city?
i, i do not mean to sound insensitive. i understand your situation. but there is nothing i can do. you just called the wrong person, that is all. i hear there are a bunch of therapists in new york. maybe you should call one of them.
mr. booker, if i could just ex --
i am very sorry, ma'am. goodbye now.
i can not find that charm daddy gave me from india.
i brought it to you in the hospital.
no, you didn't.
grace, i put it on the table near your --
does not matter.
have you decided about pilgrim?
what about him?
well... how you feel all right about telling liz to put him down...
i think we should. it is not fair to let him suffer. he is not much use anymore. he would hate living like that.
i think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
mom?
yeah?
maybe they should put me down too.
what?
i mean, I am not much use anymore. why can not they be compassionate to me?
how was the dinner?
all our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. i thought to myself, we have been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. we are so afraid we will not like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
why did you go?
they are still our friends, annie. it is nothing serious. you kid about them all the time... and i could tell paul really appreciated me being there.
did you get a hold of that horse guy?
yeah.
what did he say?
no.
what was i saying?
about us going someplace warm... someplace grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
i do not understand. you just said he said no.
he did, but... i think i can change his mind.
that is the craziest thing i ever heard. absolutely not.
robert, grace is not adjusting to school. and she can not sit in this apartment all day... i think it would be good for her.
no! what are you -- you are serious about this?
I have called liz. they can set me up with a trailer for pilgrim. i thought we would stay at motels along the way...
you have already made arrangements!?
no. i was just researching. calm down.
i come home and you tell me we are going to drive a psychotic horse to montana! i can not just pick up and leave...
I am not asking you to. I will do it.
you want to do this by yourself? how? you can not take care of pilgrim all the --
he will be sedated. i know horses, robert. I am the one who taught grace how to ride.
what... bo-... what about the magazine?
I am in charge. i went back very soon after the accident. they did not expect me for a couple of months. I will just take that time now... i can still oversee things from montana... take my fax... my computer...
no. it's, uh... no, i really do not think it is a good idea
why?!
her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
i can not say he is been all that effective with her.
are you a psychiatrist? he said it takes time.
i do not care what he says! we have to do something, robert! i can not sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
I am not pretending anything!
i really wish i could understand why you think this is so necessary.
robert, we are losing her. we are losing her.  i do not care what the doctors say. the truth is, they do not know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to grace... this may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. i can not explain it, robert. i just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, pilgrim can be made all right... then so can grace. i just know it!
what if she does not want to go?
she will if you think she should.
and you think it is best if i do not come.
no, that is not what i said. I am not a dictator. if you feel you should come, then come. just do whatever you think is right.
maybe we should give him another sedative.
problem is, there are not many volunteers. he is already had enough to sink a battleship. you have a pin, just in case?
of course not.
probably best. you may want to shoot yourself half way to ohio.
you want to take your bath?  we have to get up early tomorrow. you may not have enough time to --
fine -- I will take my bath.
no, i do not mean you have to. it is just that we may not have enough --
-- enough time tomorrow. i know.
look, if you want to take it in the morning, that is fine.
i do not care.
it is almost lunchtime. are you hungry!?
whatever you want.
fine!
fine.
you should call your dad before it gets too late.
i already did.  this morning. when you went running.
oh. you did not tell me.
i did not know i had to.
you don't.
would you like to see that?
i do not care.
i do not care.
this'll be nice. we have not seen any of the sights yet. it is history. when i was thirteen i used to love seeing things like this.
you were never thirteen, mom.
how long is this going to go on?
what?
you know what i mean?  is this it now? is this the way we are going to be from now on?
do you want us to turn around and go back home? do you?
what are you asking me for? you did not ask me if i wanted to come in the first place -- now i get to decide? forget it!
who do you think I am doing this for? I am doing this for you!
bullshit! it is about you! about you deciding! about you always being right! you always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
i do not believe this!
you just want to get away from daddy and you are using me to do it!
that is not true! whatever problems your father and i are having, have nothing to do with this.
you are amazing! you act like i do not live in that house! do not you think i hear the two of you!? do not you think i can tell what is going on? I am not five years old, mom!  you want to divorce daddy and daddy does not want to.
did he tell you that?
he does not have to! it's, like, so obvious you can not stand him.
that is not true!
then why do you want to leave?
it's... it is not that simple to explain. i know you think it is, but it is not. the truth is, i do not really know what i want to do. i do not have all the answers.
no, you just act like you do.
you buckled up?  you cold?
little.
gee, this looks like a fun place.
do not they believe in signs here?
what would they say? "ten miles to big rock." "twenty miles to bigger rock."
there was supposed to be a turn off. did i miss it?
i did not see it.
can we take a look at bronty's foal when we are done here, dad?
sure. as long as she do not mind.
there is a kid at school says we should have imprint-trained him.
he says if you do it soon as they are born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
that is what some folks say.
there was this thing on the tv about a guy who does it with geese. he has this airplane and these baby geese all grow up thinking it is their mom, and he flies it and they just follow.  you hear 'bout that, uncle t?
i do not believe it.
you know her?
it's, uh... beautiful country. i had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. there are no signs.
plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. who do i get the idea you are not just passing through!
well... ok... here it is... uh... I would like you to take a look at my horse. now -- it will not take long and if, after that, you still do not feel...
were you thinking of personally driving me back east?
oh no. she is here. i brought him along. and my daughter, too. we are staying at peterson's...
you mean you hauled him all the way out here? just like that?
well... yes... i had a trailer. it is not like i made him run along side of the car.
all by yourself?
i uh... ha, ha... i do not think i ever met a lady quite like yourself and i appreciate all the pains you have gone through to --
look! please! do not do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again!  I have driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I have brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. just take a look at him. if you still feel the same way, I will be on the road by morning and you will never see me again. ok? deal?
yeah?
uh, I am tom booker. your mother around?
she gonna be long?
probably. she is on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
what does she do?
she is an editor.
mmm. an editor.
not like books or literature or anything. just a magazine... just in case she has not told you -- which I am sure she has not -- i do not want to be a part of this, ok?
uh, no. i was gonna take a look now.
you want us to come with you? i just have to run to the main house and give mr. peterson a check.
does not matter.
grace?... grace, you want to come with us, take a look at pilgrim?
when i work with a horse, it is no good just me doing it. it does not work that way. the owner needs to be involved too.
well, that will be a little complicated --
you can make it as complicated or as easy as you like. but she is the one who is going to be riding him, am i right? so here's the deal. I am not sure i can do anything, but I am prepared to give it a go --  -- if you will help.  you have a problem with that?
is not it like, obvious?
not to me. either you want to or you don't.
look, I will talk to grace and call you later--
excuse me, with all due respect, but this is her decision, not yours. and i do not want to waste anybody's time -- mostly mine.
... well, i just think she is got a lot of nerve showing up here. draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  you eat with those fingers again and you know what will happen!  frank, do not you think she is got a nerve?
oh hell, i do not know... according to tom, she is a pretty determined woman. must have thought it was worth it.
i guess they will want feeding and all, out here all day long.
i do not believe they will expect that.
what, they am not going forty miles into choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
mixed salad.
what?
i believe women from new york eat mixed salads. am not that right, tom?
i believe so. saw it on a television show, once.
well, that is just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from new york.
when you figure on branding?
weekend after next...
tom?
yeah.
do not you go to school?
twice a month they give you a day off to work on the ranch.
he is still sitting in that damn field.
i think they call it a pasture.
there is coffee inside... i was just bringing this to tom.
would you mind if i did? I would like to talk to him.
sure.  does your daughter want to come inside?
uh, no, we are going to dinner... is this the way to the pasture?
pasture? oh, that stretch of field near the hill? yeah.
mrs. maclean -- why do not you and daughter stay for dinner?
oh uh, thank you. no, we do not want to impose.
no imposition. plenty of food. gonna get pretty dark soon. hard to find a place.
bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
we should be fine, then.
teacher asked me why we raise black angus-herefords 'stead of pure herefords.
tell her they suit the weather better. their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
they do not get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. and they are good mother.
our daddy raised pure herefords.
you know, that is interesting. i always wondered when i went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a black angus steak. i could not taste any difference although i could swear one was more tender. i did not know there was that big a difference between cows...  I have never been on a cow farm before. i must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. just laying around the fields all day until they are asked to...  do their... work.
well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. on a balance i reckon I would choose being a cow.  would you mind passing that salad young lady?
how is peterson's holding up for you?
it is fine. comfortable. i still can not get used to how dark it gets around here, though. when we leave the ranch, i always hold my breath until i can see the motel.
nobody's using it. silly for her to be driving back and forth when she do not know her way around that well...
oh, i do not know...
well, i know peterson's. old place is as good as falling down around your ears.
they are already all settled in, frank. anyway, I am sure annie wants her privacy.
it is got doors, diane. private as can be. tom?
i do not have a problem with that. it is up to annie.
well, it is worth it, really? i mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with pilgrim?
that is up to pilgrim.
we will have more room because we are moving onto the ranch. they have this empty house near this creek. it is actually pretty... ok... i love you.  dad wants to talk to you.
hi.
yeah. she seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why i said yes to this move. but, whenever it is just the two of us, i do not know... anyway... what is happening with the delco lawsuit?
taking forever. i just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before monday. i do not know how I am going to do it.
well, it is good that you are there.
so, how are you doing in marlboro country? is the magazine complaining at all?
yeah, but nothing i can not handle. lucy tells me she thinks gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
when are you coming home?
you know, i just asked that myself tonight. he does not know.
well then... maybe i will take some time... come visit.
okay.
i miss you, annie.
i know. we miss you too.
good night.
night.
did you ask him to come visit?
you already did.
did he mention it?
yeah, he is going to think about it. you want me to pack for you?
you got everything you need?
if i had everything i need, i would not be going to physical therapy.
honey, come on. would you like to stay in town for dinner? maybe see what movie's playing tonight?
why? there is no food in the house?
no. i just thought... forget it.
you know, we are branding here tomorrow. if you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you are welcome.
branding?  i have not branded in years.
I will come.
uh, i don't, honey. branding? oooh... i think we would just be in mr. booker's way.
that is not a question, is it?
you are catching on.
you okay?
it is cocktail hour yet?
now son, you tell 'em when it came from.
be honest, i can not say i did it all myself. my grandma helped me get the words right.
well, I would like to welcome annie and grace to their first branding...
and next time, miss annie, you can run down the calves...
where does this go, diane?
oh, you can just set up on the dining table. i have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
mm-mm. i never knew him. he died before frank and i met. this here's...  frank and tom's mother and father... there is little frank and tom...
she calls him tommy...
always did. i think she favored him a little. you tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.
ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. they found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a percheron stallion. she said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
i got a little confused though. the ranch ellen was talking about -- that is not this one?
why do you always wear that hat?
because it fits my head. you want to try it on?
so how was your first and last day of branding?
do not be so sure it is my last. there are a few people back home I would like to put under a red hot iron.
what?
you ever just stand still for a minute?
you stand still too long in new york you get hit by a bicycle messenger.  you know, sometimes, i get the feeling, mr. booker, that you are laughing at me. why is that?
that is your cue to say you are not laughing at me.
oh, i see, you write both sides of the conversation?
it is a man's world, mr. booker. most women have to.
well, maybe i am laughing a bit... i just thought, as long as you are here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
well... it is beautiful country, I will give you that. and i could see having some kind of vacation place. retreat. but i do not know how you do it full time. do not you miss the rest of the world?
what is that to miss?
ha... if you have never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it is something i can not explain.
does chicago count?
you lived in chicago?
when i was first married.
you were married to a woman in chicago?
i once heard itzhak perlman guest star with the chicago symphony orchestra. he played rachmaninov's vocalize opus 34. no. 14. it was one of the most beautiful pieces of music i ever heard. i actually forgot where i was for a time.  you seem surprised?
well, i, uh... you didn't...
just who is been laughing at who here?
i thought you guys were going to call me.
oh, robert, I am sorry. we were so tired from the branding. grace barely made it to her bed and i did not have the energy to take my clothes off.
oh well... branding will do that to you.
everything all right.
huh-huh. you?
fine. actually, today was a good day. you should have seen her.
i wish i did.
well, uh the real reason i called, actually, was to tell you i saw lucy at jo-jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
about what?
apparently, gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. she said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
oh. i did not look at my faxes today. we left before sunrise.
honey, i hope you are not endangering your position. listen, if you need to come back and you want me to come take over, for a while, I will work it out. i mean, the firm's got other lawyers, but the magazine's got only one of you.
I have decided it is impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
a jogger, huh?
i do not jog, mr. booker. i run.
lucky for you. the grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
if i can survive rush hour, i figure i can handle grizzlies...
you sleeping all right in that house?
i do not sleep all right anywhere. but the house is fine.
i found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
sorry about that. i thought everything got cleared out. r.b. is my wife... ex-wife... rachel. we used to live in that house together.
i thought you lived in chicago?
i thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
i have a way with animals.
it is all right. he is young. just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
oh yes. i forgot.
he is beautiful.
why do not you ride anymore? grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
she did?
are you shy, mr. booker?
just polite. well, maybe you would like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
enjoy the day.
you too.
shit.
need a lift?
i can handle it!
oh, come on! this is such bullshit! the work is getting done, david. lucky keeps me on top of everything.
lucy is not you. we are losing something without you being here. now, i know this is a rough time for you, but i think we should make another arrangement.
what the hell does that mean? how much more do i have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me?
if this magazine is so important to you annie, why are you in montana?
uh, yes... sure, david.
all right. speak to you then.
thank you. you are all doing too much.
oh, it's... i wanted to tell you that, if you would like, you being so busy, i could take grace to her therapy exercises for you. i have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.
can you drive?
drive? I am not old enough yet.
it is never too soon to start.
i can't...
i do not have all day.
put the key in and turn it.  the right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
i do not know if i can with my leg.
well, there is only one way to find out.  give it a little gas.
just follow this. nothing to it. I am going to shut my eyes here for a little while. just keep going till you run out of road.
i do not know if i can.
not a question of if you can -- you are. just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself.
where did you get pilgrim from?
we bought him in kentucky. my mother and i took a trip down there to see him.
that must have been pretty special.
are you afraid of anything?
getting old. not being of much use, i guess.  what went on out there, grace? with pilgrim?
the answer's no.
you have not heard the question yet. truth is, you would be doing me a favor. i got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
poor thing.
he would be grateful, he would take real good care with you.
is this how you are going to make me pay my phone bill?
no, ma'am, I am afraid that is extra.
relax our center... it is just sitting in a bucket.
yeah, it is been a while, but i... i remember the basic ideas...
ok. I will stop talking then.
actually, i never rode western. I am sorry. go ahead.
well, he do not know that. just sit the horse.  good... you have a nice seat.
thanks.
feel good?
yeah.
you look all right. you want to pick it up a little?
ok.
how long did you live here with your wife?
five years. my son was born here.
son?
yeah. i have not seen him in a while. he used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... good boy. hal. lives in new york near his mom.
how did you meet her?
college. in illinois. she was playing the cello. i had not heard cello music growing up. she had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. when she played, it was...
why did not it work out?
she was never really happy here. she did the best she could.
grace told me you have a country house in connecticut. sounds like a beautiful place.
it is. it is lovely.
ever think of moving there full time?
we did at one point. when we thought we would have more children. and we after tried. we tried everything, but... was not meant to be.
i hear that! see, i knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but i wanted to try -- i thought maybe she would give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. my son would grow up here. maybe have one or two more. I would teach 'em what i could. they would play with my brother's kids. all grow up together. and even if they all decided to go out into the world, they would always know where home was -- cause we would keep it for 'em...
that is very important to you, is not it? home.
yeah, i think it is. and i do not mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- it is more like, knowing where you are from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... knowing what you are supposed to be doing while you are here.
how did you find out all that?
would you let me ride your horse?
have you talked to tom about it?
of course i have.
i do not know... you sure tom said it is all right?
i thought there were too many forks on the table.
well, one was for salad...
mom, they do not mind eating with one fork.
you are right. good.
does anybody out there want something to drink?
I will take care of it.
thanks, honey.
everything under control?
not really. I would forgotten how long it is been since I have done this. and i could not get any parmesan cheese.
just make yourself comfortable.
i am comfortable.
ha, ha... all right, well, uh i guess you can bring out the pasta.
you missed a button.
huh?
it would be a whole lot easier to pay the feed end of the month...
i do not think warren would go for that.
well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
we have a business manager. the best around.
ha...
diane takes care of the books. i do not know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
am not brain surgery.
I will have another round of that spaghetti if may?
absolutely. i made enough for an army.
I will help you with the coffee.
well... i know i should reject that offer, but I am not going to.
no reason you should, no reason you should.
i was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the pyramids. were you ever in egypt?
i was there for that shot, actually.
what was it like?
oh, god -- i think it was the fourth or fifth time I would been there, so all i remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
but, uh, egypt is, well, it is like nothing else. it is like going back in time.  i remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and i felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. ha, i never realized how hard it was to describe.
I would love to go there one time...
you and frank ever take a vacation?
soon. we are going to branson, missouri to see my cousin emma married. frank loves in there.
it was my turn!
ya just had a turn. it was not.
was so!
do not be such a baby!
you just showing off for her!
you shut up, stupid!
you are the one who is stupid -- letting her go and fall off your horse!!
nothing.
did you go riding?
grace? is everything all right?  can we talk?
about what?
well...  so you tried riding again?
yeah. does that mean I am cured?!
honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
... you worried everything all right now and we will have to go home?
what are you talking about?
you... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
grace, i do not hate your father.
i can not remember the last time you made him dinner.
i was just trying to say thank you to diane and frank and --
tom?
look, i just wanted to say, i think it is great you are riding again. and... and i think i know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing...
yeah, you know everything!!
stop it! why can not i talk to you!!
no, you stop it! stop pretending like you care! like this really is not about you and tom.
what?! how can you --  I am sorry if my friendship with tom bothers you so much, but i happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what i say, it is wrong and no matter what i do, it is wrong... I am sorry I am such a disappointment to you.
well, now you know what it feels like.
i do not deserve that. i have never looked at you as a disappointment. if I am on your back to do better, if i push you to try harder it is because i want you to be the best you can be.
for you! because I am your daughter which means you are the best mother! is not that what you are always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... proving everybody wrong. wanting everybody to think you are this perfect woman!
listen, if... if there is a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you have accomplished as well... if that is wrong, then I am sorry.  but it was not my intention. i do not push for me. i do it for you... so you do not waste half your life feeling like you do not know where you belong.
yeah, well, you have done a great job.
well, then i do apologize... but what I am most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she is feeling... who can not admit when she is wrong and who can not forgive when she is not.
leave me alone!!
what did you say?
i said... i started.
started what?
my period.
when? tonight?
i felt it happen downstairs and when i went into the bathroom.
who is going to want me now?
what?... oh baby...
who is ever going to want me? nobody will.
that is not true.
why should they?
because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman i have ever met. the efforts you make. your courage and your dignity.  i do not know where you got it? i honestly do not know how i would have handled all this if i were you.
I am sorry... about what i said. it is just that -- all those times you and daddy were trying for another kid, i... i used to pray at night that it would work. and not because of you guys or that i wanted a brother or sister... but... just so i would not have to be...
what?
so special. because i was the only one. you both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and i wasn't. i was just me. and now I have completely ruined everything, anyway...
who is it?
uh, nothing. I am going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
sure.
i will not tell you it will stop feeling this bad... but i can tell you, you did not do anything wrong... the same thing would have happened to me... or frank... or joe... and there is no sense in looking for a reason why things happen...  i used to try and... always came up short. i do not think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. i remember this boy I would see up on the blackfeet reservation. he was sixteen. great kid. strong. he would gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. snapped his neck, paralyzed him... after the accident, I would look in on him from time to time... and he was not there anymore. his mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared. and what was left was nothing but anger... it is like the boy i knew just went away somewhere...
i know where he goes.
i know you do. do not you disappear.  you do whatever you have to, to hold on...  I will tell you one more thing... when pilgrim reared up to face that truck... you know what i think?... i think that damn horse loved you so much, he was trying to protect you... that is what i think.
i can't... not yet...
there is no hurry. take you time.
play that sweet one you know. the one makes my wife here so friendly.
you!
you would not want to dance with me, would you?
i do not thinks you would want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
i would not let happen.
you know, you are a good kid.
must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
well, i have more than a few days, ha, ha... i uh... I am sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... first time I have said it out loud.
they fired you?
no, it is more like a leave of-  ha, ha, ha. yeah, they fired me.
you do not seem to upset?
delayed shock. or maybe not. i know i could talk my way back if i wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... just not sure if i want to.
guess you do not have to figure it out until you go home.
did you always know this was the life you wanted?
i fell in love. after that, i never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. i never saw it like i was losing some other life, just felt like i was gaining one. i know that is not a popular opinion nowadays and i am not saying it is the right one. we all have to find the life meant for us.
frank's a good man.
they do not come better. but i do not deny there are times i wonder about things i will not have. maybe one day I will get to see egypt. maybe not. but i know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
sounds like something tom would say.
yes, it does.
what?
annie, I am not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. when you first came here, i did not like you and i was worried. tom means a lot to me and this family. do not go looking here for whatever you looking for. do not make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
i do not think anybody can make tom do anything he did not want.
he is a good man, tom is. he is got a gift, come from heaven above, i swear. but he is still a man. and a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he is on dry land.
this is mr. booker, robert.
tom.
hi. it is a pleasure. I am very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. i bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
oh yeah...
did you notice -- no cane?
i know. amazing.
can we show him pilgrim, tom?
let's bring your bags inside.
wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
is there anything you need? I am going food-shopping.
well, i am going to go after lunch.
no, no, I will go -- just give me a list.
i can not believe it is the same horse.
we still have a way to go.
how much longer do you think?
well, like i told your wife, it is really up to pilgrim.
i understand...
we thought we lost him in the snow storm... told the kids. had a funeral for the damn thing. finally, snow stops. staring to warm up. i go out and start cleaning the truck... goddamn if that dog does not jump out from the back seat covered in snow... i nearly stained myself.
he thought it was a ghost.
is the poverty worse, now, you think?
i have not been back in over twenty years, but i would not be surprised. the population's larger.
i think I am going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. just might be his first broken heart.
oh, how sweet.
small bed. maybe i should sleep in the barn.
you are allergic to hay.
i apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and i figured...
you do not have to explain. you have every right to come.
i can see why you put your faith in him. he is a genuine... good guy... good at what he does. that is rare.
you were right about coming here. I am sorry for not thinking...
no, it is okay. believe me, there were plenty of times i did not know what the hell was right.
how are you feeling about work?
let's not talk about that now.
i have some brownies left over. want one?
no thanks.
sure?
sure.
there is still something going on inside of him i can not reach. so me and smokey here, we are going to try laying him down. okay?
what does that mean?
it is more or less how it sounds. sometimes it is not pretty to watch. some horses fight it real hard. your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. so if you do not want to watch, I will call you when it is done.
i want to watch.
grace, i need you to come with me.
no, you are only going to hurt him some more.
he is not hurt. he is okay. look at him.
no!
grace, listen... you have got to do this. just trust me one more time.
now, listen. i want you to stand on him.
what?!
it is so cruel.
no. he had the choice.
what choice!!?
either fight the way things are or accept it.
oh frank, do not forget the wedding present -- it is behind the door in the laundry room.  i got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... not that they will know what to do with it in branton, missouri... probably use it as a planter.
diane!
frank's touchy about his cousins.  well, it was nice to meet you, mr. maclean.
now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? there are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
i already know the way... and it is not like i have a job i have to rush home for.  between you and me, i could use the time alone.
it is just one night. if i get uncomfortable, I will go over to hanks.
promise?
promise.
good luck to you, annie.
you too, diane.
should not we have invited tom over?
i did. he said he had work to do until late.
are you going to stay in the city or go up to connecticut?
connecticut. i told the office I would work out of there next week. when are you planning to start back?
probably first thing in the morning. it is too late to start now. I am going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
may i have a suggestion?
yeah, what?
take your time.
what do you mean?
I will tell you something, annie -- i stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... and, i swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
i do not understa-
and i have two choices. i can either fight the way things are, or accept them.  see, i always knew i loved you more. did not bother me. i always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... and i guess i thought as long as i did everything right -- if i was the best husband i could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if i could do all that, it would not make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... i was not asking for more. i told myself i did not need more.  but you do not know how you feel about me. you do not know... if you want a life with me anymore...  and i do not want you to come home until you do know...  ... one way or the other.
what is the matter, honey? going to miss pilgrim?
tom's gone.
smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in sheriden. he will not be back for three days. i can not believe he did not want to say goodbye.
well... honey... you know... that is just not his way. maybe you can write him a letter or something. say thank you... do not think about it... you take care and I will see you home.
i will not apologize for this. and i will not hide it. not for anybody.
i will not ask you to.
oh, god, what are we going to do? I am supposed to --
ssshhh...  stand still, annie. takes what we have got, just for now. can you do that?
show me again.
annie!
one more time.
summers are short here, annie. there is not much of a fall. before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.
i do not care! we would be together.
two people can not just be alone together in the world. at least not us...
i can not do this. i can not leave you...
i figured, whenever you decided to go, you would be all set.
how thoughtful of you. and what if i decide not to go?
i do not know any other way, annie.
why?
then what have we been doing? i mean what was the point?
the point was to love each other.
why?
yes?
hi. um, there does not seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. are you "tubab"?
no. i am a "tubab."
what do you mean?
tubab means white man.
oh, i miss you. you look beautiful.
so do you.
how is everything?
good.
hi.
was the trip okay?
mmm. i made good time.  pilgrim's in the back. i found a new stable, but they can not take him until tomorrow.
great!
go ahead...
i have so much to tell you.
you want to take a walk with me?
where to?
i do not know. let's just go and... we will see...
