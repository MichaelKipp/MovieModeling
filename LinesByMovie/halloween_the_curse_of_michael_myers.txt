shh.  mommy's here.  what is it?
the voice man!  he is here!
home is here in grandma and grandpa's new house.  at least while I am in college. remember our deal.
the kids at school said this is a haunted house -- that a bad man used to live here.
they did, did they?  since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
but I have seen him!
you have been watching too much tv.
he says things.  bad things.
like what?
no, mom -- keep it on!
okay ... but just for tonight.
christ, what a night!  not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
that is the whole idea of living in the country.  i thrive on the seclusion.
unlike you, sam, i learned many years ago not to second-guess the motives of my fellow man. remember what freud said:  'sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.'  or, in this case, a drink is just a drink.
i hope you did not come all the way out here in this storm just to quote freud.
as always, your keen powers of perception astound me.  and you are right.  I have come to celebrate.  after thirty-two years as psychiatric administrator, guess who has been named smith's groves new chief of staff.
but surely rogers is not --
retiring.
we need you, dr. loomis.
you should know that it is not wise to play halloween pranks on me.
you are the only man for the job, sam. things have not been the same since you left.  I am recruiting the best psychiatric team in the country.  old colleagues.  this is your change to finally make a difference.
but with rogers and his house of hacks gone, you would make the rules.  just think it over.
please try to understand, terence. I have already made up my mind.
so they are trying to kill you and your baby. do not tell me.  your name also happens to be rosemary.
no -- please listen!  they are coming ... coming for me and my baby.
come on, sweetheart -- what is this? who is coming?
it is ... michael ...  ... michael myers!
it was her voice.  on the radio.  it was jamie.  calling for me.
you do not know that for sure.  it could have been anyone.  a practical joke. kids.
it was jamie lloyd.  she came back, as i knew she would one day.  and whatever has brought her back has brought michael back as well.
after six years?  sam, she died with him in that explosion after the --
that is what someone wants us to believe, but i tell you michael is alive.  i feel him.  i sense the evil that lives inside, just as i did all those years as i watched him.  sitting behind these very same walls.  staring. growing stronger.  as my colleague, as my friend, please. i can not go through this again.  not alone.  i need your help to stop him.
notify haddonfield's sheriff; tell him we are on our way.  i want the entire staff on alert.  we go to code red lockdown for twenty-four hours.  if he is alive, i plan on bringing him back.
or what is left of him.
shitheads ... defacing my property.  i showed them ...
relax, john.  they were just kids.
kids are what is ruining this country. everywhere you go, it is the same.  no goddamn respect.
see what I am talkin' about?
you will never pass that exam on an empty stomach, kara.
he do that to you?
another episode of 'daddy knows best' at the strode house.
pig.  what the hell happened this time?
hold on, hot lips.  we got work to do.
shit, beth, why do we have to be the ones to organnize this friggin' fair? it is only halloween.
whatever happened to women in back?
reality check, dillweed.  this is 1995.
beth, who is that guy that lives across the hall from you?
why?  you interested?
no!  i keep seeing him staring out his window. watching me.
you mean tommy.  yeah, on the weirdness scale he is about an eleven.  supposedly some scary shit happened to him when he was a kid.  messed up his head.  he is harmless, though.  probably just lonely.
happy fuckin' halloween.
someone is trying to scare us out of having this fair ... and it is not going to work.
so they are trying to kill you and your baby. do not tell me.  your name also happens to be rosemary.
no, please listen!  they are coming ... coming for me and my baby.
come on, sweetheart -- what is this? who is coming?
it is ... michael ... michael myers!
what is that?
it is a sign.  he is come home.
sam, do not -- let them take care of her.
I am here now, jamie.  you are going to live. you have to.
yes?
dr. loomis, thank god you are here.  you heard her, did not you?  it was jamie.
I am sorry, but do i know you --
I am tommy.  tommy doyle.  laurie strode -- jamie's mother -- she was baby-sitting for me that night --
yes ... tommy.  what are you doing here?
please -- just tell me the truth.  has michael myers come home?
what do you know about michael?
i know he is alive.  people in this town -- they want us to believe he is dead.  but i know. I have always known.
right now at least one girl is dead and jamie lloyd is in there fighting for her life.  she is the last of his blood line.  if she dies --
no, dr. loomis.  she is not the last night.
there you are.  who was that boy?
an old friend.
I have been knocking.  the door was open. is everything all right in here?
who are you?
I have come to help your family.
he crept up these stairs and made his way into this room.  his sister's room. right here. where it all began.
what makes you think he will come here again?
this house is sacred to him.  it is the source of his memories -- his rage.  mrs. strode, i beg you.  do not let your family suffer the same fast as laurie and her daughter.
jamie?  but i thought she was --
found this morning.  in a field outside haddonfield.  stabbed.
what should i do?
lock the doors and call your husband. get your family as far away from haddonfield as possible.
god ... this can not be true.
mrs. strode, michael myers is here to kill his family.  and he will not stop until you are all destroyed.  i only thank god that i found you before he did.
what is it this time?
a man came by the house.  a psychiatrist by the name of loomis.
he told me about the terrible things that happened here.  in our house.
what the fuck are you doing letting strangers in without --
john, they sound jamie lloyd this morning! someone tried to kill her!
what in god's name are you talking about, woman?  when are you going to stop listening to those damned talk shows?
I am getting the children out of here. at least until we know what we are dealing with.  john, i want you to come with us.
debra, you are fuckin' insane.
you knew, did not you, john?  you knew.
she was not here when i brought danny home from --
danny, go downstairs -- now!
my, god!  what have you done to him?
i did not -- he got in a fight and i --
you stay away from him!
seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... photos for the school paper at nine ... then harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... i just know I am forgetting something!
relax.  everything's cool.  did not i tell you harry would be here?
there is more people moving eastbound down old reservoir road past the elementary school.
any word on the location of the strodes?
no one's home.  checked it out myself.
good.  i want around-the-clock surveillance on that house.
what is wrong?  what is happened to jamie?
I will meet you over there.
mom, i want to go to the fair ...
you can not expect us to stay here --
do you know how insane this is?  who am i supposed to be looking for?
him.
come on, mom.  we are going to miss all the fun stuff!
danny, you are just going to have to wait!
god, what is wrong with him?
here.  let me try.
kyle's mother might be dead for all i know. now I am afraid he could be next.
why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
not just kyle.  all of you.  his entire family.  here.  look at this.
it was there when i found him this morning.  it looks like some kind of letter or number or --
it is a rune ... thorn.
runes were a kind of early alphabet that originated in northern europe thousands of years ago.  they were symbols -- carved out of stone or pieces of wood.  of all the runes, thorn had the most negative influence. cults used them in blood rituals to portend future events and invoke magic.
black magic ...  'in ancient times, thorn was believed to cause sickness, famine and death. translated literally, it was the name of a demon spirit that delivered human sacrifices ... on the celtic celebration of samhain.'
halloween.
'when applied directly to another person, thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the devil.'
where are you going?
to find the rest of your family before michael myers does -- or whoever's been controlling him.
danny?!  danny!
mrs. blankenship, have you seen the little boy who came in with me and --
jesus, that is my neighbor.  tommy.
is not he that psycho who is been spying on my sister?
kara and danny never showed up tonight. we would better go home and check on them. there is nothing else for us to do here.
but they are going to light the tree in a few minutes --
we can light our own tree at home.
mommy, I am scared.
there is nothing to be scared of, baby. it is just another storm.  try to get some sleep.
i can't.  the voice man is coming to get me.
no one's coming to get you.  not while I am around.
promise?
i promise.
guess they -- went to the fair after all.
guess so ...
what if your parents come home?
then they can watch.
are not you going to answer that?
answer what?
what if it is kara?
mom -- who is this?
kara? ... no, this is beth.
what are you doing there?  where is my mother?
we were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
is tim there?
he is in the bathroom.
where is the baby?!
he is gone.
who else knew i had the baby?!
no one.
no -- there had to be someone else. who knew?!
only me --  -- and dr. wynn.
run, tommy!!!  run!!!
no!!!
danny!  danny, where are you?!
kara, no!
where is the child?
sam, you know you never fail to amaze me.  yesterday happily retired, today right back in the thick of things. somehow i knew you still had it in you.
come now, sam.  this is a gathering of old friends.  i know how difficult this must be for you -- a man of your upbringing and integrity -- but now that I am in charge i felt it was only fair that you finally know the truth.  after all, you are the only one around here who is still in the dark, as it were.  this is not the way i wanted to tell you, but you have really given me no other choice.
this is madness, wynn.
your madness is another man's greatness.  this is the way things have always been.  you have just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  but having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  you always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. finding him. bringing him back to us once he would finished his work.  although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, i had to go after him myself.  and what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
it was you.
sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
why did you take jamie?
she has the gift -- the blood of thorn running through her veins.  michael's mother had it, too.  so for six years i incubated her, prepared her for this night.  michael has served his purpose.  and soon we will have a new progeny.
jamie's baby ...
there you go trying to make sense again.  it is a curse.  handed down through countless generations. as ageless as this celebration which you call halloween.
samhain.
and I am its deliverer.  its calling card, if you will.  i follow it.  protect it. act as its guardian.  in a sense, sam, so do you.
you have created a monster.
amazing, is not it?  i even taught him to drive.
no!!!
stay away, sam.
leave the boy.  take me.
mommy!!!
danny!!!
what now?!
wait a minute ...
come on!
it is not working!
