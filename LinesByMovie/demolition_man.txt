what do you mean he is escaped?! they are not supposed to escape!
it is a real mess down here.  some- thing must a'gone wrong.  no man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
tell doucet that.  what was his rehabilitation training?
telephone repairman.
just great.
npa syndrome will hit 'im fast.  have your men gear up the edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  saying a prayer will not be bad either.
i do not want any press on this.  I have got an election to win day after to- morrow.
jesus, sanchez... what do you think you are doin'?  that is flatfoot data. you are not supposed to have access to that.
this is the guy that killed my partner.
you startin' a fan club or some- thin'?
says here one of our boys brought him down.  you ever heard of a badge named wade?
demolition man.
what is it mean?
you never want to find out.
take a look at this.
he had a partner.  our own ray gallagher.  he tagged wade dangerously defiant. psychotic.  reckless.  seems our commissioner did not like him much. busted his buns on a narcotic's violation.  wade was sentenced to twenty-five years.
he went dirty and they made an example of him.
but he was such a good cop.
they always are.
well I have got news for you.  this dirty cop was the only cop who could bag doucet.
looks like ya gonna take office just in time, chief.  things need straightening up in this city.
what'cha got, bennett?
witnesses say some wacko went judge hunting with a late model.  i got an artist working on a computer composite now.
technothugs?
no chance.  not their sector.  they am not even into things this big. our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  something else.  unit nine found a couple cold ones in hollywood.  one manny turner.  gun runner. sounds like a connection to me.
i can smell it.
that is him.  simon doucet.
jesus.  sweet jesus.  we have got trouble.
this monster escaped from cryo- prison this morning.
well, he is sure working fast am not he?
i want this bastard brought down.
that is not your zone.  stick to data entry.
i was part of the escort team that re-animated him.  my partner's dead because of this guy.
wade's in cryo-prison.
he could be brought back.
kill him... kill him.
simon doucet.  you are under arrest. please come out with your hands in the air.
yeah?
wade's here.
looks like you did more than jackoff while i was gone.
maybe re-animating you was not such a bright idea.  you look like shit.
shucks, and i got all dressed up.
twenty years have passed, wade. lay it to rest.
i was set up and you know it... but you swore under oath i was dirty. you helped bury me.
jury found you guilty, not me.  i just called it as i saw it.  fuck that.  you were brought here for a reason.  doucet's escaped.  re-animated for his parole hearing.  killed a lot of people.  most of them cops.
I am not on the force anymore.
well, you have just been taken off the bench.
i want to see my wife and kid.
later.  i want doucet first.
i told you.  I am out of the cops and robbers business.  retired twenty years ago.  I have been trained as a bus driver.  got a whole route planned and everything.  even nailed down the lingo - 'exact change, please'.
I am going to bring this down hard. I have got an a-1 badass killer loose, an election day after tomorrow, and I am risking everything on you. you are going to bring him in.  i do not care how.  if you do, you will get your freedom.  an official pardon from me.  a clean slate.  a good job.  a chance to get back with your family.  if you do not want to, I will put your ass back in the freezer so fast, you will forget you were ever defrosted.
what is this?
fill it out.  standard issue mal- practice insurance.  all cops carry it.
mug sheets.
i remember what he looks like.  i can not forget.
edicon system made these.  ages, photographs.  we use it to find missing children.
he is not that old yet.  you have lost confidence in me.
no, but he is going to be by tomorrow. he is aging.  'bout the entire twenty years lost while being frozen in forty-eight hours.  in that time he will be an old man.  could be a year, an hour, or all at once. called npa syndrome.  natural pro- gression of aging.  it affects each individual differently.  I am sure it is painful.
you son-of-a-bitch.  how do you stop it?
we have an antidote that will retard the aging process.
give it to me.
when you bring in doucet.
the faster you get doucet, the younger you will be.
I am going to kill you when this is all over.
you are working a partner on this.
I have been alone for twenty years. i do not feel very sociable.
you my partner?
officer hector sanchez, sergeant. hillside academy.  status g-8. security clearance 3.  one year advance technical crime analyst. weapons assistant.  fda junior captain, hollywood division---
are you a cop?
yes.
well, that is good enough for me.
i drive.
commissioner gallagher gave me specific orders not to let you drive until you re-familiarize yourself with the process and territory.
I am ready.
but sergeant...
give me a break, sanchez.  it is like riding a bike.
does it drive itself, too?
you have to use the steering wheel to turn.  the pedal for gas...
got it.  ejection seat?
whoa.  do not touch that.  pursuit mode.  auto pilot.  computerized steering and driving system used in high speed pursuits.  installed fall 2006.  underground rumor has it they modeled it after you, sir.
lean year for role models.
i have to go home, sanchez.
commissioner gallagher said...  ...twenty years is a long time.
no offense, but why did they partner me with a rookie?
doucet killed my partner.
see those guys?
technothugs.
they are going to rob that bank.
how do you know?
some things never change.
I will inform dispatch.
there is no time.  there are civilians in there.  it is about to go down.
we do not know that for sure.  we will have to wait until they move.
well, I am sure.  you are a cop.  I am a cop.  let's do what cops do.
doucet's just offed two of the jurors who put him away.  I am rounding up the rest of them and putting them in police custody.  what is your status?
we seem to've come across a 211, sir.
forget it.  stick to the program.
you can not turn him off.  he is the commissioner.
I am not fond of television comedies.
wanna come?
my insurance will not cover it.
you two fucks listen up.  doucet's killing people and you are wasting valuable time busting two-bit technothugs.
but sir, sergeant wade saved the hostages.
I am thrilled beyond belief.
sir, your transmission's fading.
what the hell are you talking about?
thanks.  want'a bite?  mcdonald's vegiroll.
pass.
can i ask you something?
yes.
when you are frozen, you are legally dead, right?
then what goes on in there?  what i mean is, what are you thinking about?
bacon cheeseburgers.
give me a break.  I am serious. what is it like to be dead?
trust me.  you do not want to know.
hey, buddy...
relax, let technology do the work.
npa metamorphosis should biologically slow him down.  that is when we will get him.
you can not catch this man with a computer.
how then?
you do not follow the bodies, and you do not follow procedure.  you do it by instinct.  think like him.  do what has to be dane.
sir, i took the liberty of running a gci scenario on a tm-1 earlier today...
gci.  tm-1.  what language are you talking?
i also pvc'd you.  youngest officer promoted to sergeant. two cms.  four honor medals...
drop it.
why?
i was set up.
you are saying you were put away for a crime you did not commit?
'bout the same time i busted doucet i tried to nail this big-time dealer. i did not have an id, but i was close. too close.  gained the confidence of a badass named dubbs.  he was going to turn me onto the big man.  he made me for a cop.  mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
it does not make sense.  who would want to do that to you?
nothing makes sense when you are a cop.
married?
engaged.  plan on doing it this summer.  you still married?
yeah.  least i think so.  twenty- six years this march.
what is this place?
this is where i found doucet twenty years ago.  thought maybe he would come back.
yeah.
hey, rip van winkle, maybe we would better call it a night.
she is pretty.
thanks.
you need anything else?
I will be okay.
good night, wade.
good night.
I will have a cup of coffee?
never use it.  stuff'll kill ya.
no.  talk english.  then I will understand.
we get to peek into doucet's brain.
hey, I am eating.
I am serious, wade.  this case is important to me.
you want to be a good detective?
yes, sir.
then find me some cigarettes.
two lousy smokes.  you are a real sport.
that cost me two weeks' pay.
maybe i should turn myself in.
lighten up.  you are going to give yourself an ulcer.
part of doucet's cerebellum, a portion called the vermis is under- developed.  this area rates response to outside stimuli.  com- pare it to that of a normal law- abiding citizen.  it could be why he kills.
great.  my partner's marcus welby.
I am just doing it by the book. analyze then vaporize.  crime's a science.  everything's analyzed.
with all this technology you do not even have to show up for work.  who needs cops when you have got gizmos.
you are just afraid to use this.  you have technophobia, wade.  that is what you got.
wanna try?
no thank you, sir.  smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema, and may complicate pregnancy.
you are not pregnant, are you?
no, sir.
let's roll.  we got a guy who swears his car was stolen by a suspect identical to doucet. 0800 this morning.
what else did he get?
wallet, cash, i.d...
fire up that thing of yours and tell me all credit card trans- actions after eight o'clock.
kid, you ever been in a high speed chase before?
simulated one.
get us some fuck'n back-up now!
comwatch dispatch system.  can not assimilate voice stress.  code priority only.
sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you are ready.
fine.
I have also drafted a letter to families of officers killed in the line of duty.  they will need your signature.
hello wade.
out of the room.
tell frick and frack that means them too.
I will be alright.
you can not kill me.  I am going to be mayor tomorrow.
I am not voting for you.
ah, fuck you, wade.  this is bull- shit.  you are not going to kill me.  you are not going to risk your freedom.
i want to stop aging.
and i want doucet.
sir, your limo's here.
kill me if you want.  hard line me with that 'i am not got nothing to lose' bullshit.  but you have got plenty to lose 'partner'.  you have got a family.  I am giving you a chance to see them.  i kept in touch.  she never married. all these years.  maybe she loves you.  i would not know why.
this is a war, wade.  you against him.  vengeance time.  the city's just in the way.  kill the fucker. you and me.  we will work things out when the time is right.
remember my promise.
do not threaten me.  i tend to take these things seriously.  and get a couple hours sleep.  you look like day old shit.
got compliments coming outta your ass, do not ya?
you okay?
how do i look?
aces.
okay, that is all folks.  commissioner gallagher has to go.
keep 'em busy.
rip van winkle.
how ya feeling?
how do i look?
not too good.
what is this?
we are partners, are not we?
sanchez...?
I am here.
you treat her nice.
...what are you talking about...?
your girl.  being a cop will be rough on her.
...have you been drinking?
not yet.
need help?
i got it.  i got it.
you sure?  i can help you.
ah mom, you are embarrass'n me.
nobody's looking.
go in the house.
maybe i should put on the training whe---
not the 't' word.
ooops, i forgot.
you all right?
yeah.
seat's too high.
my mom says I am going to grow.
yes.
my granddad was a policeman.
I am going to be a policeman.
what is your name?
william simpson.  i like willy.
good to know you, willy.
bye.  thanks.
remember, get the seat fixed.
michael called yesterday.  he wants to take willy for the summer.
what did you say?
I would think about it.
mr. murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
he just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like i made for you.
i think he wants more than your cookies.
kimberly!
mom, i hate to break this to you, but there is a whole other species out there you are neglecting.  if you have forgotten, they are called 'men'.  sometimes referred to in more colorful language.
talk fast.  polls open in half an hour.
wade did a little reminiscing.
hi.
hi.
have not seen you around.  where have you been all my life, handsome?
funny.  would you like to buy me a drink?
this little thing says i can't.
you could always take it off.
it is stuck, but thanks for the offer.
papers.  last medcheck two weeks ago. a-1.  disease free.  guaranteed by the state.
i do not care if you have got the good housekeeping seal of approval... I am not looking for company.
yeah.
this should make your day.  the guy who testified against you... dubbs... was arrested a total number of twenty- four times.
so, he is got a thing for prison clothes.
that is just it.  he never did time. seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  judge threw out the cases each time.  either he is got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
you okay?
aaah... mother of jesus.
what is it?  your legs?  hands?
hospital food.
what are you doing this for, sanchez?
if you were set up, i want to find out who did it.
just got the call.  took him from school.  bastard nailed the vice- principal and a teacher.
where?
I am wasting time.
you can not win like this.  you will only get older.  this is what you wanted!
not anymore.
i just heard.
he is got my grandson, sanchez.
you be careful.
I am signing off.
no.  i want to be with you.
no you don't.
who is it?
avon lady!
my man dubbs.
who are you?  what the fuck do you want?
i want to ask you a few questions.
no, you are not model material.  anything else?
funny guy.
fuck you - fuck you.
you helped set up my partner, sergeant william wade.  i want to know who put you up to it.
your mother.
speak up.
it was wade's old partner... gallagher. he was behind it all.
i worked for him... still do.  said he would make sure i was left alone if i helped put wade away.  he kept his promise for twenty years.
prepare for a change in lifestyle.
you should be in hospital.
and you should be with your family.
what is it?  I am about to go on.
we have to talk.
i heard about today.  good job.  I am all for capital punishment.  why do not you go home and see your family?
that was not your plan, was it?
what are you talking about?
you were planning to send me back to the ice house.  you set me up.
you are crazy.
you were the dirty cop... and i was on to you.  you panicked.  afraid i was going to expose you... so you shut me up.
i do not want to hear anymore.
you stole the heroin out of the evidence room and planted it on me.  i was iced.  what better way to keep me from talking.  stop me if I am wrong.
you have no evidence.  arrest this man.
you want evidence.  I will give you evidence.
it was wade's old partner... gallagher. he was behind it all.
put that on your political resume.
sir---
shut up!  drop it.
