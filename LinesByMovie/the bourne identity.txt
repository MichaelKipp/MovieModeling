you're awake.  can you hear me?  you've been shot.  i'm trying to help you.  you were in the water.  you've been shot.  it's okay now.
where am i?
you're american.  i thought so. from your teeth -- the dental work --
<u>where am i</u>?
you're on a boat.  a fishing boat. italian flag.  we're out of vietri.  it's the cold that saved you.  the water.  the wounds are clean.  i'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  it's clean.
how did i get here?
you we're lost at sea.  they pulled you out.  who are you?  you were shot -- two bullets -- in the back.  you understand me?  who are you?
what if it doesn't come back?
i told you.  you need to rest.
it came from your hip.  under the skin.  you have a bank in zurich.  you remember zurich?
no.
look, i'm just on this boat, okay? i'm an engineer.  whatever this is, it's not for me to be involved, okay?
i don't remember zurich.
you drink rum?
i don't know.
it's not much, but it should get you to switzerland.
i won't forget this.
what?
abbott wants to talk.
tell him we're busy.
i tried.
storm clouds are gathering, ted. it looks like rain and i don't have a thing to wear.
i don't know what we're talking about.
we're talking about marseille. we're talking about nykwana wombosi. and i'm asking you if this abortion in marseille has anything to do with treadstone.  was this treadstone?
you're asking me a direct question?
yes.
i thought you were never going to do that.
they're putting together an agency oversight committee.  they're going to look through everyone's budgets. treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.  what am i going to do about that?
you'd want to make that go away. you'd want to remind them that treadstone is a training organization.  that it's all theoretical.  you'd want to sign off on that.
and what if i couldn't do that?
then i'd have to explain treadstone. and you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.  doesn't sound like much of a plan-b, does it?  we'll clean up the field.  you clean up your budgets.
miss kreutz, please... i'm gonna have to ask you to keep your voice down.
all the papers -- all the papers they asked for -- i brought all the papers --
<u>miss kreutz</u>, excuse me, but you entered into a fraudulent marriage in an effort to circumvent the immigration laws of the united states --
you only know that because i told you!  ask the case officer -- find his name -- it's on the papers -- i told him all this myself! --
-- it's not the source of the information that's important here --
-- i paid this fucking guy -- i paid him four thousand dollars -- my last four thousand dollars to marry me, okay? -- i told this to the case officer last week...  ...<u>here</u> -- mr. thomas.  i told mr. thomas i didn't know this guy was already married -- i admitted this!
-- miss kreutz, please --
-- i'm the one that got ripped off! -- not you -- not the united states government -- me -- i'm the one being ripped off!
so now you're asking for a student visa?
-- and they're sure it's him? --
-- he accessed the account --
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
you're a u.s. citizen?
yes.  i mean, i think so.  yes.  yes...
well, either you are, or you aren't.
right.
you have your passport?
i have a passport.  i've got...  actually, it's a little complicated.
<u>do you have your passport, sir</u>?
look, maybe i should just...
sir, you waited on line.
yeah, i know...
-- what're you talking about? --
-- we're evacuating the building --
-- we're in the middle of a trade meeting! --
-- call the code! -- i want everyone out! --
-- you gotta give me more to go on --
-- he's running from the cops, he's got a bag filled with god knows what, he's in the building and i don't know where! --
i need a ride.

i need a ride out of here.
oh, jesus...
please.  i don't want to scare you.
it's a little late for that.
i've got a situation here and --
get the fuck away from my car.
i'll give you ten thousand dollars to drive me to paris.
great.  you know what?  i'll give you ten gazillion dollars to get the fuck away from me before i start screaming my head off.
you don't want the police any more than i do.
jesus...
get me out of here.  <u>please</u>.
what?
zurich police are looking for an american with a red bag.  apparently he put two cops in the hospital last night.
what the fuck is he doing?
maybe it's a game.  maybe he's trying to send us a message.
it doesn't matter now.  we've just got to be the first ones there.  get everybody up.  i want them all activated.
all of them?
so what's in paris?
i want to go home.
for twenty thousand dollars.
i said ten thousand.
you have blood on your pants.
okay.  twenty thousand.  ten now.  ten there.
<u>no</u>.  no, that was too easy --
wait up --  -- just wait up --
-- get the fuck out of here -- all this money, this crazy offer, i mean give me a fucking break with this, this is --
look, i want a ride to paris.  that's all i want.  i swear.
you swear?  that's great.  i feel so much better now.
i don't want anything but a ride. all i want to do is go home.
you could buy a car for twenty grand.  you could buy this car.
i don't want to go alone.  i want you to drive me to paris.  like we're a couple.  like we're a couple and we're travelling together.  that's all we're doing.
and i don't get hurt.  i get twenty thousand dollars and i don't get hurt.
i won't hurt you.
what if i say no?
then i'll find another ride.
just so you know, if you're gonna burn me on the money, you might as well kill me.  i was supposed to have this car back three days ago.  it's not my car.
i know that.
shit --  can i tell you how much you're freaking me out?  okay?  because you are -- you're completely freaking me out.
i'm sorry.  really.  what do you want me to do?
i don't know.  smile.  sneeze. something.  you've got a bag full of money and a ride to paris.  fuck it, i don't know...  what kind of music do you like?
i don't know.
what does that mean?
listen to what you want.
who pays twenty thousand dollars for a ride to paris?
i don't know.  i don't know who i am.
yeah, well, welcome to the club.
no.  no, i mean, i really don't know who i am.  i can't remember anything earlier than two weeks ago.  i'm serious.
what?  like amnesia?
look, go ahead...put the radio on...
amnesia?  you're saying you don't remember anything that happened before two weeks ago?
that's what i'm saying.

and you have no idea -- not a clue -- what came before that?
no.
when you think of it, before the ship -- before you wake up on the ship, what do you see?
nothing.  it's just not there.
well, this is great.  i'm sick of myself and you have no idea who you are.
i kept trying things, i thought if i could find all the things i could do, i could --
-- you could put it together --
-- which was okay for a while, i was okay with it...  but then -- there's all these other things -- all these other things i know how to do -- and this -- this stuff from the bank and...  i think something bad happened.
what are you talking about?
i don't know.
sounds like you were in an accident or something.
i was shot twice in the back.
okay, so you're a victim.
there was a gun.  who has a safe deposit box with a gun and all this money and all these passports?
lots of people have guns.  you're american.  americans love guns.
i fought my way out of an embassy. i climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- i went out the window and i was doing it -- i just did it.  i knew how to do it.
people do amazing things when they're scared.
why do i? -- i come in here -- instinctively -- first thing i do -- i'm looking for the exit -- i'm catching the sightlines -- i know i can't sit with my back to the door --
you're paranoid.  you were shot. it's natural.
and that's the best angle of the courtyard?
that's the only angle.
what do they have on the streets? the area.  they must have something.
hang on...
what?
abbott.  he knows about the embassy. he's coming down for a show and tell.
that'll solve all our problems.
sir...
what's that?
it's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
enhance it.
i needed a break.
where are we?
we're about an hour away.
i can't believe i slept.
you were tired.  here...  for twenty-thousand i like to throw in breakfast.  so what do you dream about?
i dream i'm asleep.  i dream that i'm asleep and i can't wake up.  i don't think i smoke.
you ever think maybe you have a family?
i thought about it.  i don't know.
she's a gypsy.  if it's a cover, it's a great one.
i'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
we're exploring <u>every</u> possibility.  we are in pursuit.  how much more do you want me to tell you?
pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.
no.  pursuit <u>ends</u> when we know exactly where he is.
yes, well, i think we need some fresh eyes on this problem.  i'm bringing in some people from upstairs.
we've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. we've been <u>sleeping</u> down here.  we just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? -- now that we <u>finally</u> have something to work with -- you want to bring planning personnel down here?  i'd rethink that.
i want a second opinion.
<u>this is an operations desk</u>.
i'm not asking.
slow down.  no, don't stop.  just...
that's it?  is that it?
four-fifty.  that's the address...
looks familiar?
no.  no.  go around.  keep going...
where?
yeah.  pull in here.  park it.
so this is it, right?
i guess.
i should go.
i don't remember any of this.
jason...
okay, so...
thanks for the ride.
anytime.
look, i don't know what's up there.
you got me pretty fucking curious.
look, you could come up.  or you could wait if you want.  i could go check it out.  you could wait.
nah...  with you, i mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
how could i forget about you?  you're the only person i know.
this is like a real apartment.  this is really yours?
i guess so.
this is your office?  god, you live like a monk...
all this stuff -- it's all about boats.  i think i'm in the shipping business.
see.  it's starting to come back, yeah?  you mind if i take a bath?
go ahead.
...yes -- oui -- uh...

paris?
yes, sir...  how can i help you?
yes, i'm...i'm looking for mr. jason bourne.
one moment, please...  i'm afraid, i have no one by that name registered, sir.
d'accord...  merci.  un moment -- un moment --
-- sir? --
-- hang on -- i need you to check another name for me -- hang on -- un moment, s'il vous plait --
kane.  do you have mr. john michael kane?
one moment, sir.
bonjour?  monsieur?  allo...
yes, i'm here...
you call about monsieur kane?  john michael kane?
yes.  is he there?
you are a friend of his?
yes.
i have some very bad news for you, sir.  i'm terrible sorry to have to tell you this, but monsieur kane has passed away almost two weeks ago...
there was an accident.  on the motorway.  apparently, he was killed instantly.  really, i'm terrible sorry to be the one to tell you this...
...i understand...
...we actually, we were unaware for several days that this had happened. when they came for his things, it was made known for us, you see?
who?  who came?
his brother.  you know his brother?
right.  yes.  of course.
it's very bad this.  terrible sad. such a young man.
do you -- his brother -- do you have a phone number?
i think not...  no, i'm sorry.  it was very sudden. he was here very briefly.
-- no -- marie -- <u>no</u>! -- it's not like that --
-- please -- jason -- omigod --
-- quiet -- <u>quiet</u> --
-- what're you doing? -- jason, please, tell me what's happening!
open it --  -- do it -- what's he got in there?
why are you trying to kill me?
...omigod, no...
what? -- what? --  -- what is it?
...this is my picture... he's got my picture --  -- this is me -- this is zurich -- this...this...this is yesterday --
-- just --
-- where does this come from? --  how do you have my picture?
marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
-- let me do this, okay? --
-- do what? -- what are you doing? -- he's got my picture --  -- he's -- my god -- look at him -- he's bleeding to death -- my picture -- look! -- he was trying to kill us! -- omigod --
he's dead isn't he?
marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
he went out the window -- why? -- why would someone do that?
-- we can't stay here -- i can't stay here -- it's not safe here --
he came to kill us.
-- we can go -- i can get us out of here -- but we have to go now --
you knew he was coming.
no.
i trusted you.
you're wrong.  i didn't know.
i don't trust anybody and i trusted you!
i didn't know this would happen.
he had my picture!  he knew i was here!  he came here to kill us!
and where is he now?  you believe what you want, but i'm telling you the truth -- i never would have brought you here if i thought it was dangerous.
oh, jesus...
you stay -- if you want, you stay -- it's okay -- it's better -- maybe it's better -- i don't know --  but i can't stay here.  <u>i can't</u>.
but the police --
-- there's no time --
-- we'll explain it --
-- how? --
-- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just --
-- forget it --
-- we'll tell them what happened --
i don't know what happened!  i don't know who he is!  i don't know what he wants!  i don't even know who i am!  the only thing i know is that if i stay here, i'm never gonna find out!
that was two hours -- two hours to get a second opinion -- and nothing changes.  he's loose.  he's out of control.  it's very clear what needs to happen.  i have work to do.
what if he <u>is</u> working for someone else?  what if he turned?
turn?  to who?  where does he turn? what does he have to offer?  he's got nothing.  he's a killer.  he's a piece of equipment for crissake. where's he gonna turn?
you stayed there five times in the past six months.  but i didn't have time -- i could only get the bill from the last stay -- you were there for two days.  some room service -- there's half a dozen phone calls here so that's someth--
who paid the bill?
it's a company... mpg capital.
-- let's check that interpol window again --
-- i'm on it --
-- i want that red car -- the girl -- we gotta get lucky here --
no.  we can't risk it.
our last sighting was forty-eight hours ago.  even if they stayed in the car, the grid is huge.  this is it.  he's trained -- conditioned -- they're built to disappear.  you give him another day to run and we may never find him.
this doesn't go upstairs.
mr. kane...  come right in...please...have a seat.
thanks.
well...  i must admit, when my assistant told me you were here i was, really -- i was quite -- i was surprised.
really.
we thought you were gone for good.
did you?
well, i mean it's a tough business, isn't it?  cutthroat.
look, our bid -- it was competitive -- but definitely at the high end of competitive -- when we didn't hear back from you, we did some re-analysis of the numbers, and honestly, we'd really like a chance to do a bit better.  i'm assuming you're still in the market.  it's the same vessel?
yes.
we just picked up a job quite like the one we were bidding for you. gorgeous boat, hundred-and-seventy- five-foot pleasure cruiser.  i think we learned a few things that might allow us to make our proposal for your job, as i said, a bit more competitive.
okay.
was it the break-in?
excuse me?
we also thought we hadn't heard from you -- we've had a bit of a publicity nightmare, people have been talking.  our offices were broken into -- vandalism mostly -- shortly after we last spoke.
i hadn't heard.
let me get you a new copy of the proposal.
that'd be great.
i found it.  it took six calls.  i found kane.  i found the body.
let's go --  we got to get away from this phone.
where did this body go?
i said, someone came last night --  look, this isn't a carnival -- people call and they make an appointment and they follow the rules -- everyone signs in and out -- this is a serious place -- serious work -- it's not just to come in whenever you like --
shit, we didn't sign in.
so get the hell out of here.
fine.  but i'd like to sign in.  in fact, i insist on it.  where's the book?  i gotta sign in --
is this it? --  -- this is it, right? --
-- slow down -- you can't just take the book like that --
-- don't sweat it, i have a pen -- no problem -- just let me find the page --  -- honey, why don't you wait for me outside, okay? --
-- we have rules here, this is a very serious place -- i'm the one who decides who gets in here, okay? --
-- what do i? -- i put the name of the person i came to see? --
-- this is serious business down here and we cannot have people coming and going --
-- here we go -- i found it --
-- i don't know what you're doing and you're scaring me -- what are you looking for? -- what just happened in there? --
nykwana wombosi.
what is that?
it's a name.  mr. wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  he's the proud owner of an alliance security package.  he also paid a visit to the morgue to see john michael kane.
what does that mean?  jason, what does that mean?  jason, please...who is he?
i don't know.
<u>so what are we doing</u>?
go back to the hotel.
-- he went inside! --
-- if we can get a clean shot --
-- <u>inside</u> the house? --
-- that's what they're trained for -- just a surgical strike.
forget it.
what do you want to do?
we don't know what we're into!
we're in the shitter, man!  pick your poison.  maybe he's in there to finish the job.  maybe he's working for wombosi.  maybe they want to go on tv together.  every possibility sucks -- we've got to move!
did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  it was tax shelters, wasn't it?  swiss debenture-swaps.
mpg capital.
i think investment advice from a dead man, it's a bad idea.  how does it feel to be dead?
it's a lot more stressful than i thought.
who do you think sent me?
i know who sent you.  i don't know why.  i learned many, many things from the cia.  <u>many</u> things.  i learned the way they think.  was the bomb on my boat supposed to go off or not?
<u>was this a game or a fuck up</u>?
i don't know.
get the kids out!
i'm going to paris.
<u>no you're not</u>.  you're not going anywhere.  i'm shutting this down.
you're not doing shit.  you're so scared you can't even think.
you just blew up a house in paris! this program is over.  call it off.
i can't call it off.  he's not responding.  get out of my way.
it doesn't matter who you were before.  it's who you want to be. that's all that matters.  we have this money.  we have what we have.  i had nothing before and now, i don't know, maybe i have more, maybe it's nothing, but...  i say we leave here.  we leave this place.  we go until we can't go anymore.
you could do that?
yes.  that's who i want to be.
xxxxxx...

xxxxxx.

stop where you are.
what?
where's the dog?
my husband's out looking for him.
he run away often?
that old beast?  miss his breakfast? not a chance.  it's always something, right?
get in the basement.
what?
get everyone down in the basement.
what the hell're you talking about?
you're in danger.  all of you.  i have no time to explain.
wait a minute --
i'm sorry.

treadstone?
...which one are you?...
paris.  i live in paris...
...headaches...you have that...i get such bad headaches...
yes.
...it's a problem...
treadstone.
...or in a car...when it's dark...something with the headlights...  ...pills, right?  treadstone had those pills...
what is treadstone?
...what did you do?...you must've really fucked up...
i think so.
...someone said caffeine -- for a headache...doesn't seem...
what do they want me to do?
...they won't let you go...
why?
and that's it?
if you're lucky.  take it.  there's enough in there to make a life.  any life.  just get out now. get low.  stay low.  <u>take it</u>.
what was i thinking, right?
i can't protect you anymore.
what about you?
i'm gonna find the end of this.  i can't protect you.
are you treadstone?
am i treadstone?  me?  what the hell're you talking about?
<u>what did you do to me</u>?
what did i do?  i spent thirty million dollars on you.  i spent three years finding you -- four years training you --  what did i do?  what in the name of god have you been doing, jason?
i don't know.
they're right about you, aren't they?  you're fried.  you really don't know what's going on, do you?
i know you've been trying to kill me.
of course.  we had to try.  we didn't know what was wrong.  we didn't know you were in trouble.
so now you know.
so it's time to go home.
that's all i get?
we'll make you better.  we can put the pieces back.  we can do that.
i don't think so.
we have to go home, jason.
jason bourne is dead.
<u>there never was a jason bourne</u>.  you have to come with me.  it's the only way.  we can give it back to you...
keep it.
jason...  they can't let you go...
that'll be their second worst mistake.
can i help you?
this your store?
yes.
think i could rent a scooter?
you have id?
not really.
