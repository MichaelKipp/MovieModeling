i will not be more than ten minutes, i promise you.
even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
i said -- uh -- i said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
do not be embarrassed, bruce. i heard it, but i just wanted to hear it again. i can stand being spoiled a little. the gentleman I am going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
I would like to spoil him just once. sure you do not want me to go in with you?
my job, bruce. i started it -- and I will finish it.
i suppose you are right -- but if it gets rough, remember I am here.
I will come a-running, pardner.
what do you want?
why, I am surprised, mr. burns. that is no way to talk to your wife -- even if she is no longer your wife.
hello, hildy!
hello, walter.  hi, louie -- how is the slotmachine king?
oh, i am not doing that any more. I am retired. I am one of you fellas now -- a newspaper man.
editorials?
walter!
I am busy, duffy.
well, you are not too busy to know that the governor has not signed that reprieve!
what?
and that means earl williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of us!
you are crazy. where is mac?
he is on my phone. he just called me.
they can not do that to me!
do not blame me. I am city editor in name only. you do all the hiring around here.
yeah! well, i do the firing, too. remember that, duffy, and keep a civil tongue in your head.
how long is what?
you know what. how long since we have seen each other?
let's see. i was in reno six weeks -- then bermuda... oh, about four months, i guess. seems like yesterday to me.
maybe it was yesterday. been seeing me in your dreams?
no -- mama does not dream about you any more, walter. you would not know the old girl now.
oh, yes i would. I would know you any time --
you are repeating yourself! that is the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
i notice you still remember it.
I will always remember it. if i had not remembered it, i would not have divorced you.
you know, hildy, i sort of wish you had not done it.
done what?
divorced me. it sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. it almost gives him a feeling he was not wanted.
holy mackerel! look, walter, that is what divorces are for.
nonsense. you have got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. why, a divorce does not mean anything today. it is only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. we have got something between us nothing can change.
i suppose that is true in a way. i am fond of you, walter. i often wish you were not such a stinker.
now, that is a nice thing to say.
well, why did you promise me you would not fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
well, i meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
a fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'hildy: do not be hasty -- remember my dimple. walter.! it held things up twenty minutes while the judge ran out to watch it.
well, i do not want to brag, but I have still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- i just acted like any husband who does not want to see his home broken up.
what home?
was it my fault? did i know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? i meant to be with you on our honeymoon, hildy -- honest i did.
all i know is that instead of two weeks in atlantic city with my bridegroom, i spent two weeks in a coal mine with john kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! you do not deny that. do you?
deny it! I am proud of it! we beat the whole country on that story.
well, suppose we did? that is not what i got married for. what is the good of -- look, walter, i came up here to tell you that you will have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I am --
let's not fight, hildy. tell you what. you come back to work on the paper and if we find we can not get along in a friendly way, we will get married again.
what?!!
i have not any hard feelings.
walter, you are wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what i came up here for?
sure, come on. we will have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
i have a lunch date. i just want --
you can break it, can not you?
no, i can't.
sure you can. come on.
do not tell me what to do! we are divorced -- I am a free woman. you are not my husband and you are not my boss! and what is more, you are not going to be my boss.
what do you mean by that?
just what i said. that is what i --
you mean you are not coming back to work here?
that is the first time you have been right today. that is what i --
you have had a better offer, eh?
you bet I have got a better offer.
well, go on and take it. work for somebody else! that is the gratitude i get for --
i know, walter, but i --
what were you when you came here five years ago? a little college girl from a school of journalism! i took a little doll-faced mugg --
you would not have taken me if i had not been doll-faced!
why should i? i thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
listen, walter --
i made a great reporter out of you, hildy, but you will not be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. you need me and i need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. and so will you. it just did not work out, walter.
it would have worked if you would been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. but no! you had to marry me and spoil everything.
i was not satisfied! i suppose i proposed to you!
well, you practically did! making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till i broke down. and i still claim i was tight the night i proposed. if you would been a gentleman you would have forgotten all about it. but not you!
you -- you --
sweeney! you can not do that to me! not today, of all days! jumping jehosophat! oh, no, sweeney... well, i suppose so... all right. if you have to, you have to.  how do you like that? everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
what is the matter?
sweeney.
dead?
not yet. might just as well be. the only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
sweeney?  well, after all, he did not do it on purpose, did he?
i do not care whether he did or not. he is supposed to be covering the earl williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! is there no sense of honor left in this country?
well, have not you got anybody else?
there is nobody else on the paper who can write! this'll break me, unless --  hildy!
no!
you have got to help me, hildy.
keep away --
it will bring us together again, hildy -- just the way we used to be.
that is what I am afraid of. "any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
do not mock, hildy, this is bigger than anything that is happened to us. do not do it for me! do it for the paper.
get away, svengali.
if you will not do it for love, how about money? forget the other offer and I will raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
all right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
please! will you just --
great grief! what is that other paper going to give you?
I am not working for any other paper!
oh! in that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. trying to blackjack --
look at this!
i tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I am getting married, walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as i can get! I am through.
get married all you want to, hildy, but you can not quit the newspaper business.
you can not sell me that, walter.
who says i can't? you are a newspaper man.
that is why I am quitting. i want to go some place where i can be a woman.
i know you, hildy, and i know what it would mean. it would kill you.
a journalist! peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! i know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? so a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what is going on! no, walter, I am through.
where did you meet this man?
bermuda.
bermuda... rich, eh?
not what you would call rich. makes about five thousand a year.
what is his line?
he is in the insurance business.
the insurance business?
it is a good, honest business, is not it?
oh sure, it is honest. but somehow, i can not picture you with a guy who sells policies.
well, i can, and i love it! he forgets the office when he is with me. he does not treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
he does, does he? how did i treat you -- like a water buffalo?
i do not know about water buffaloes, but i know about him. he is kind and sweet and considerate. he wants a home -- and children.
say, sounds more like a guy i ought to marry. what is his name?
well, I will give you a hint. by tomorrow they will be calling me mrs. bruce baldwin.
tomorrow? tomorrow... as quick as that?
the quicker the better. well -- i finally got out what i came in to tell you.  so long, walter, and better luck next time.
i wish you everything i could not give you, hildy.
thanks...
too bad i could not see this guy first. I am pretty particular about whom my wife marries.
well, he is waiting in the anteroom for me now.
say, could i meet him?
oh, better not, walter. would not do any good.
you are not afraid, are you?
afraid? i should say not!
all right then, come on and let's see this paragon.  is he as good as you say?
better.
then what does he want with you?
now you got me.
nothing personal. i was just asking.
you would not believe this, walter, but bruce holds the door open for me.
no kidding?
and he takes his hat off when he is with a lady.
what for?
and when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
oh, I am sorry.
allow me.
thanks.
mr. burns --
I have just told you i was busy with mr. bruce baldwin!
I am bruce baldwin!
you are bruce baldwin?
yes!
then who are you?
this is a pleasure, mr. baldwin, and I am sorry about the mistake.

oh, i thought there was something funny... you see, bruce, you do not mind if i call you bruce, do you? after all, we are practically related --
mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
you see, my wife -- i mean, your wife -- that is, i mean hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
oh.
but i see, she did not mean old in years. you always carry an umbrella, bruce?
well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
that is right. -- rubbers, too, i hope? a man ought to be prepared for any emergency.
attaboy!  come on, bruce.
where are we going?
where are we going? I am going to buy you two lunch -- did not hildy tell you?
no -- she didn't.
just wanted to surprise you, i guess.  down!  after you, bruce!  come on, hildy, my treat!
i suppose i can not call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it is your last fling.
how do you like that? here i am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that is the thanks i get!
how is everything, gus?
i can not complain.
oh -- I will take the same, i guess. and coffee.
little rum in yours, too?
i guess so.
no -- just coffee, gus.
just coffee.  and you, sir?
well, so you are getting married tomorrow, eh? how does it feel, bruce?
feels awful good. yes, sir -- we are taking the four of the clock train to albany and tomorrow we will be married.
taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?
oh, it is not like that.
it will be perfectly all right, walter. mother is coming with us on the train.
mother? but your mother --
no. my mother.
oh. your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind.
i know i was not a good husband, hildy, but you can always count on me.
i do not think she will need you very much -- i aim to do most of the protecting myself.
well, I will tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she is looking at you.
i might have, walter, but you were never there.
anyway, I am glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things i could not give her. you know, hildy is about the best reporter in the country -- and that goes regardless of sex. but all she really ever wanted was a home.
well, I will try to give her one.
i know you will, bruce. are you going to live with your mother?
just for the first year.
that will be nice. a home with mother. a real honeymoon. in albany, too. ow!
mighty nice little town, albany. they have got the state capitol there, you know.
yes, i know...  hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? she did not even know i was in town...
how is business, bruce?
well, albany's a mighty good insurance town. most people there take it out pretty early in life.
i do not blame them.
oh, I am sorry, gus! my foot must have slipped.
that is all right.
i sometimes wish I would taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it does not matter. still, i suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
well, i honestly feel that way. i figure I am in one line of business that really helps people. of course, we do not help you much when you are alive -- but afterward -- that is what counts.
i see what you mean.
gus, this --
good coffee, is not it?
here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
thank you.
you know, hildy, he is not a bad fellow.
you are so nice, bruce, you think everybody else is.
oh, he is not the man for you. i can see that. but i sort of like him. got a lot of charm.
he comes by it naturally. his grandfather was a snake.
if anybody had told me I would be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
that is what he did to me. swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
too hot?
no. it is strong.  but i like it that way.
say, what is happened to burns? he looks sunk, does not he?
he certainly -- hic -- does!
anything the matter?
just sweeney again. one of my best reporters.
what now?
his wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. they can not even find him.  i tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
you said it.
so -- sweeney gets twins -- and earl williams gets hanged tomorrow.
just what is the lowdown on williams?
it is simple. a poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
if he is nuts, why does not the state just put him away?
because it happened to be a colored policeman.
the colored vote happens to be very important to the mayor of this town.
especially with an election coming up in a few days.
are you sure williams is not all there?
all you have got to do is talk to him. but the mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
but could not you show the man was not responsible?
how?
how long would the interview take?
oh -- an hour for the interview. another hour to write it.
we could take the six of the clock train, hildy. if it would save a man's life.
no, bruce, dear. do not you see? this is a trick to get your sympathy. no, walter, I have been waiting for something like this -- but i was not sure when you would spring it. if you want to save earl williams' life, you can interview him yourself. you are still a good reporter. bruce and i will be on that four of the clock train -- and thanks just the same.
I am an editor. i know what ought to be written, but i can not write it the way you could. it needs a woman's heart --
why, walter, you are getting poetic!
you see what i had to put up with? she never trusted me! you argue with her -- otherwise you are going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
how can you have any happiness after that? all through the years you will remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! i tell you, earl williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!
what a performance! bravo! do not let him fool you, bruce -- it is only an act!
what do you mean, only an act? have not you got any feeling?
well, it is either an act on your part or a miracle on sweeney's.
what do you mean?
i happen to know sweeney was married only three months ago. if he is got twins this morning, i claim it was done with mirrors.
all right, hildy, I am licked. but I will make you and bruce a business proposition.
we are not interested.
maybe you will be. you are a smart young man. you let hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000.00 insurance policy for me. what do you say?
i do not use my wife for business purposes, mr. burns!
wait a minute, bruce. what is commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
and what is the matter with a thousand dollars?
but --
according to the budget, we laid out that is more than our food bill for a whole year. listen, bruce, i do not want walter burns to use me, but I am perfectly willing to use him. how long will it take to get him examined?
i could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.
now you are talking!
you keep out of this. bruce, suppose you examine mr. burns in his office. I will get my bag and go over to the press room in the criminal courts building. you phone me as soon as mr. burns has given you his check. then I will go get the interview and you phone mother that we are taking the six of the clock train.  and no tricks, walter!
what tricks would i pull?
oh, nothing! of course, you might cancel the check. yes! wait a minute! what would be his first payment on that policy?
about twenty-five hundred dollars.
better make that a certified check, walter.
what do you think i am -- a crook?
yes --- and that is putting it mildly! no certified check -- no story -- get me?
all right. the check will be certified. want my fingerprints?
no thanks, I have still got those. well, I will step into some working clothes and hop over to the press room for the background on this yarn. it will be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. remember, bruce, it must be certified.
all right, dear.
wait a minute, bruce. have you got that money?
the five hundred? sure.
on second thought, would you let me have it? I will get the tickets.
but --
believe me, bruce, i know what I am doing. he would get you in a crap game --
but i do not gamble, hilda!
i know a lot of men who did not do anything till they met walter burns. please, dear.
all right.  one -- two -- three -- four -- five. five hundred. be careful, honey.
I will be careful, darling. you be, please.
i never knew hildy to be so determined before.
you have not seen anything yet.
I will call.
three sixes. is that any good?
well, that about covers everything.
good. now i want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. did earl williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
if you ask us, no. if you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes.
it is a simple story. earl williams works for the e.j. mcclosky manufacturing company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. he starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. a year ago the mcclosky company goes out of business and williams loses his job.  take it away, fred wilson!
well -- williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he is got to save the world. only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he is harmless and they are kinda sorry for him. but one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a veteran's parade and the cops chase him. he gets scared and goes into hiding.  come in, dave schwartz.
his honor, the mayor, now comes out with a statement that earl williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in molly malloy's joint. and this colored policeman, daniels, goes over to pick williams up. williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. that is all.
say, that is old prissy bensinger's desk.
i know, i just want to give him a thrill.
you fight it cut.
and up a dime.
i call. what you got?
three bullets! any good?
beats king up.
hello, harvard! got anything new on the hanging?
why do not you fellows get your own news?
can not you say 'hello' to a fellow?
hildy!
are you back?
no, just a farewell appearance, batting for sweeney. I am going into business for myself.
what doing?
I am getting married tomorrow.
well, congratulations! good luck!
that must be the tenth alienist they have had on williams. even if he was not crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  gimme the desk.
this egelhoffer's pretty good.
yeah? what did he ever do for his country?
do not you remember? he is the guy went to washington to interview the brain trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. it created a sensation!
this is murphy. more slop on the hanging.
a double guard's been thrown around the jail, municipal buildings, railroad terminals, and elevated stations to prepare for the expected general uprising of radicals at the hour of execution.
ready? the sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the red army -- which is leaving moscow in a couple of minutes.  up a dime.
the sheriff has just received four more letters threatening his life, but he says nothing can interfere with his duty.
and to prove to the voters that the red menace is on the level, the sheriff has written himself four more letters, threatening his life. i know he wrote 'em on account of the misspellings.
trouble is, when the red menace shows up the sheriff will still be crying 'wolf!'
what have you got, hildy?
kings and sixes.
that is good.
'kings and sixes the pot affixes'... poetry. i learned that at my grandma's knee.
i do not know. this makes me feel funny.
why should not i make hildy my beneficiary? I have got nobody else to leave it to.
i feel i ought to take care of her.
well, you will take care of her. after all, if that doctor's right, I am going to live for a long time yet. look, bruce, this is a debt of honor. i was a very bad husband: hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she would wanted to, but she would not take any. she had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
well, I am independent, too.
figure it this way: i ought to be good for twenty-five years. by that time, you will probably have made enough so that the money will not mean anything. but suppose you have not made good -- do not you think hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
well, of course, if you put it that way.
and remember this, bruce! i love her, too.
I am beginning to realize that.
and the beauty of it is she will never have to know 'till I have passed on. maybe she will think kindly of me --- after I am gone.
gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
no, bruce, you did not come between us. it was all over for her before you came on the scene. for me -- it will never be over.
here's that certified check, walter.  i drew out my wife's savings, and if this is not back by 5:30 I am a ruined man!
do not worry, duffy, you will have it back by five.  thanks, duffy. stick around.
well, bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
certified! I am afraid hildy'd feel ashamed to think she had not trusted you.
well, she will know some day.
that is all i ask. oh, wait a minute.
do not want to forget this, you know. might start to rain again.
thanks. I will phone hildy right away to get that story.
well, anyway, i know hildy's getting a good man.
thanks a lot.
well, i got to get back. you can find your way out, can not you?
oh, sure.  well, thanks for everything.
do not thank me. i should thank you. so long.
so long.
i do not know why you boys are so good to me.
your poker's improved a lot, hildy. lend me two bucks, will you?
nothing doing. I am playing for keeps.
well, anyhow, i will not be covering stuff like this any more.
what is the matter? getting yellow?
hildy johnson... oh, hello, bruce. have you got it? is it certified?
certified and everything. got it right here in my wallet... what? no, he is not here -- I am in a phone booth.
certified, eh? who is it -- your milkman?
but, bruce, do not keep it in your wallet!... well, you see --  -- there is an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. that brings you good luck for ten years.
say, I have been a reporter twenty years and never heard any hooey like that. where did you get it?
i made it up just now, and who is asking you?  i know it is silly, honey, but do it for me, will not you?... yes, right now.
all right. I have done it. now, are you satisfied?
fine. and here's a kiss for you.
hello, hildy! what are you doing around here?
i want to interview earl williams, warden. how about a little service?
no more interviews. besides, a doctor's coming over.
say, is not this your twenty dollars?
i think it is.
i thought so. come on, I am in a hurry.
i could not plead insanity, because you see I am just as sane as anybody else.
you did not mean to kill that policeman?
of course not. i could not kill anybody -- it is against everything I have ever stood for. they know it was an accident. they are not hanging me for that -- they are hanging me for my beliefs.
what are your beliefs, earl?
they are very simple. i believe in the golden rule. I am not the first man to die for preaching it. but if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
how would you go about applying the golden rule, earl?
I would do away with the profit system and have production for use only. there is enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we would use some sense.
"production for use only." well, maybe that is the answer.
it is the only answer. everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. does not that make sense?
yes, that makes a lot of sense, earl.
a gun?  why -- to shoot, of course.
is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
sure. you see, I would never had a gun in my hand before and i did not know what to do with it. well, when i get stuck, i know that there is an answer for everything in production for use. so it came to me in a flash: what is a gun for? to shoot! so i shot. simple is not it?
very simple, earl.
there is nothing crazy about that, is there?
no, earl, not at all.  who sent you the flowers, earl?
miss mollie malloy. she is a wonderful person.
is not that her picture?
yes. is not she beautiful?
same way you did.  through that gate.
i gave strict orders that nobody was to interview williams without my permission.
all right, then, I will just run the story that sheriff hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
now, wait a minute! I am not afraid of anything. what were you going to write about williams?
oh, nothing much. just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. if you do not want me to run it --
oh, that will be all right, hildy. go ahead, run it. and you can say i treated him well, too.  'lo, earl. how are you feeling?
fine, thanks, sheriff.
that is good, earl. oh, they have got another alienist to see you. he ought to be here any minute. do not go to sleep, will you?
i won't.
hildy, how did you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
no, thanks sheriff. I am leaving town tonight.
you ought to stay over. you always wrote a good hanging story, hildy.
that is awful kind of you, sheriff. I have got to get started on my interview. see you later.
do not forget about production for use.
i won't, earl.
well, a guy can win when hildy am not around.
who is this guy she is going to marry?
baldwin -- his name is.
i give that marriage six months.
she says she is going to write fiction.
well, if she is going to write fiction, there is nothing like being a reporter.
well, well -- miss mollie malloy.
hello, mollie.
come on, mollie. this is no place for you.
they are not human!
they are newspaper men, mollie. they can not help themselves. the lord made them that way.
it was not the lord! it was the devil!
you guys wanna play some more poker?
what is the use? i can not win a pot.
who? hildy johnson? she just stepped out. she will be back in a second. who? oh, mr. baldwin. well, if you will hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. all right.
baldwin. the blushing bridegroom -- himself.
what is he want?
wants hildy -- and sounds very excited.
gentlemen of the press! always picking on somebody who can not defend himself -- the littler the better.
phone for you, hildy.
who is it?
oh, some insurance man. are you in?
give me that!
boy, did you see her go?
lioness rushes to defense of cub.
the newspapers! sheriff, they are the scum of modern civilization.
you said it!
they are always after me for interviews.
me, too.
of course, i sort of promised them i would give out a statement when i got through here. you do not mind?
well, i do not know if that is ethical. you see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
we will have to satisfy them. what would you say to giving them a joint interview? i could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects.
a joint interview, eh? that might be all right. we could have our pictures taken together, doctor.
yes, shaking hands. i do not take a very good picture, though.
it does not matter. the publicity's the main thing.
yes, i suppose so. it all helps.
are you gentlemen all through with me?
oh, I am sorry. i forgot you were here. no, mr. williams, we still have some questions for you. sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights?
you know you are to be executed, mr. williams. who do you feel is responsible for that?
the system. but I am not afraid to die, doctor. I am dying for what i believe.
i see. you realize, however, that you committed a crime?
in a legal sense, yes. but not actually. actually, I am innocent. i did not do anything.
let him out of here, lieutenant.
but, hildy, i can't. he is accused of stealing a watch. and they found the watch on him.
and who accused him? diamond louis! one of the worst crooks in town! why do not you arrest louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
now, hildy --
do not hildy me! are you going to let him out?
i can't.
all right. you can't. but tomorrow the post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd street that your brother-in-law runs. and we will print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
now, hildy, do not be hasty! i can not let him out.
you can let him out on bail, can not you?
five hundred dollars.
you will take fifty and like it!
well, all right. but I am liable to get into a jam.
what is the matter?
i lost my wallet.
the check, bruce!
that is right here. gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition.
yes, was not it?
i can not imagine who did it. i can not think of any enemies i have.
I am sure you have not any.
for a minute, i thought maybe walter burns was at the back of it. but then i realized he could not have been.
oh, no. how could you ever think of such a thing?
oh, i realized right away. he is really a very nice fellow, hildy -- i found that out.
yes, he is... look, bruce, we are taking that next train -- and when i say next train, this time i mean it!
did you finish the interview?
the criminal courts building.
no -- but I am sure it will be all right with walter.
but, gee, hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
well, the story's practically finished. I will just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger.
it is getting so a girl can not step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.  hello, post... mr. walter burns, please.
well, hildy, we were only saying that a swell reporter like you would not give this up so easily.
this is hildy johnson...  oh, i can give it up all right. without a single quiver. I am going to live like a human being -- not like you rats.  oh, is that you, walter dear? oh, i did not mean "dear." that was just habit, i guess. oh, be yourself, walter. I have got some news for you... yes, i got the interview, but I have got some news that is more important.
hello, mr. burns. yes, she is still here.
I will take it.  what is the matter, mr. burns -- do not you understand english? -- why, your language is shocking, mr. burns -- positively shocking! i do not mind because i was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose central is listening in... oh, did you hear that, central? we ought to report him, do not you think?... oh, fooey on you!
i hope you are pretty nearly through with me, doctor, I am getting a little fatigued.
yeah, you do not want to tire him out, doctor.
i do not know --
come, come, sheriff, lightning does not strike in the same place twice. nothing's going to happen.
now, the sheriff will be mollie malloy, in whose room you were. you will be earl williams. and i will be the policeman. follow me, mr. williams?
yes, sir.
so -- now i say to you: 'earl williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me.
well, it was not exactly that way --
point the gun at me!
goodbye, yonson.
so long, hildy.
look out!
look out where you are aiming, will you?
cooley, i want to talk to you.
hildy -- i can't. I am busy -- i -- let me up, hildy. earl williams has escaped --
there is money in it, cooley.
i can not hildy. it means my job! it means --
a lot of money.  four hundred and fifty dollars --
how much?
four hundred and fifty dollars. is it a deal?
it is a deal. let me up.
let's see the money.
first we talk. how did earl williams get that gun?
no, i tell you! nobody knows where he got it.
the crime commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for williams' capture.
call you back.
if the mayor wants me, he knows where i am.
this tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of sheriff hartman's bombing squad.
what went off?
four of mr. hartman's deputy sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
a fine fair-weather friend you are!
the names are merwyn d. mayor, who is the mayor's brother-in-law --
after all I have done for you --
howard shenken, the sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
there goes another scrub lady.
I will go right after it.
any dope yet on how he got out?
from all i can get the sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
exclusive? that is great.
it cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of cooley.
never mind that. what is the story?
never mind it? that is not my money! that is bruce's money!
you will get it. now what is the story?  I will have the paper send the money right down to you. i swear it on my mother's grave.
wait a minute. your mother's alive.
i meant on my grandmother's grave. do not be so technical, hildy. what is the story?!
well, this expert dr. egelhoffer, from new york, decides to make williams re-enact the crime --
well, I am coming to it. it seems the professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? nobody else but that great thinker, sheriff hartman!
no kidding, hildy.  say, this is not a rib?
no, this is on the level, walter. I am not good enough to make this one up. the sheriff gave his gun to the professor, the professor gave it to earl, and earl gave it right back to the professor -- right in the stomach! who? no, egelhoffer was not hurt badly. they took him to the county hospital where they are afraid he will recover.
that is great work, hildy... huh? oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I will see you get it in fifteen minutes.
it better be fifteen minutes, because bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
hold on a minute.
hello, hildy. i thought you were gone.
i thought so, too.
did you get that, hildy?
no -- what?
if walter burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I will be right back.
okay, hildy.  well, we can not get any official statement --
so have we!
what is the dope, sheriff?
who engineered this getaway?
where is he?
where he used to live. you can catch the riot squad -- it is just going out.
pete, i want to talk to you!
i am not got time, fred, honest. I will see you after.
did you actually give williams that gun?
the professor asked me for it -- i thought it was for something scientific!
pete, I have got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --
now, listen, fred. just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I will get results. I am doing everything humanly possible. I have just sworn in four hundred deputies.
four hundred! do you want to bankrupt this administration?
I am getting them for twelve dollars a night.
twelve dollars! -- for those rheumatic uncles of yours?  out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
if you are talking about my brother- in-law, he is worked for the city fifteen years.
pete, you are through!
what do you mean -- through?
i mean I am scratching your name off the ticket tuesday and running czernecki in your place. it is nothing personal. and, pete -- it is the only way out. it is a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
fred!
now, pete! please do not appeal to my sentimental side.
fred, i do not know what to say. a thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
i wish you would not talk like that, pete.
our families, fred. I have always looked on bessie as my own sister.
if there was any way out...
that gives you an idea of what I am up against!
we are up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'reform the reds with a rope'.
williams am not a red, and you know it!
well, there is a lot of communistic sympathizers around --
i know it! but they have got nothing to do with this case! do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang earl williams we are going to lose 'em?
but we are going to hang him, fred. he can not get away.
I am sheriff hartman. you want me?
you are certainly a hard fellow to find, sheriff.
what do you want?
I am a messenger at the state house. this is from the governor.
what is from the governor?
the reprieve for earl williams.
for who?
earl williams. the reprieve.
the governor gave me his word of honor he would not interfere. two days ago!
and you fell for it, pete. it frightens me what I would like to do to you.  who else knows about this?
they were all standing around when he wrote it. it was after they got back from fishing.
get the governor on the phone!
you can not get him on the phone. he is out duckshooting now.
fishing! duckshooting! how do you like that. a guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected governor and right away he thinks he is tarzan!
read it! insane, he says.  he knows very well that williams am not insane!
yeah. but i --
pure politics!
an attempt to ruin us!
dementia praecox oh-h-h!
we got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. what will we tell 'em?
tell 'em the party is through in this state on account of you.
ah, fred --  hello... this is hartman --
and you can tell 'em as an afterthought that i want your resignation now!
sssh. wait, fred.  what?... where?... where? holy moses!
what is it?
they got him!  wait a minute -- hold the wire.  they got earl williams surrounded -- the riot squad has -- in his house.
tell 'em to hold the wire.
i did.  hold the wire.
cover up that transmitter!
now, listen! you never arrived here with this -- reprieve. get it?
yes, i did, just now. do not you remember?
how much do you make a week?
huh?
how much do you make a week? what is your salary?
forty dollars.
no -- do not out me off.
how would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. that is almost a hundred dollars a week!
who? me?
who do you think!
now, listen. there is a fine opening for a fellow like you in the city sealer's office.
the what?
the city sealer's office!
you mean here in the city?
yes, yes!
well, wait a minute, will you? I am in conference.
no, i could not do that.
why not?
i could not work in the city. you see, I have got my family in the country.
but you could bring 'em in here! we will pay all your expenses.
no, i do not think so.
for heaven's sake, why not?
i got two kids going to school there, and if i changed them from one town to another, they would lose a grade.
no, they would not -- they would gain one! and i guarantee that they will graduate with highest honors!
yeah?
hold your horses -- will you, olsen? hurry up, fred!
now what do you say?
this puts me in a peculiar hole.
no, it doesn't.  now, remember: you never delivered this.  you got caught in the traffic, or something.  now, get out of here and do not let anybody see you.
but how do i know...?
come in and see me in my office tomorrow. what is your name?
pinkus.
all right, mr. pinkus, all you have got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. here!  go to this address. it is a nice, homey little place, and they will take care of you for the night. just tell 'em fred sent you. and here's fifty dollars on account.
you forgot to tell me what a city sealer has to do.
I will explain it tomorrow!
is it hard?
no! it is easy -- it is very easy!
just one second --
that is good, because my health am not what it used to be.
we will fix that, too.
just -- one -- second!
all right. tell 'em to shoot to kill.
what?
shoot to kill, i said.
i do not know, fred. there is that reprieve if they ever find out.
nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. now, do as i tell you.
hello, olsen... listen...  shoot to kill... that is the orders pass the word along... no! we dont want him! and listen, olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... yes, I will be right out there.  well, i hope that is the right thing to do.
now take that guilty look off your face, pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
if we did not have election tuesday I would have this on my conscience.
have you got my dough?
oh, sure. the boss sent me over with it. four hundred dollars, was not it?
four hundred and fifty and I will cut your throat if you try any tricks!
all right, all right. you can not blame a guy for tryin', can you?
come on with that money!
first you got to sign a receipt.
where is the money?
keep your shirt on. i got it -- right here.  one hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. now sign.
here!
thanks. so long, hildy!
so long, nothing! where is bruce baldwin's wallet?
huh?
none of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! you stuck bruce baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! now, give me that wallet or I will stick you in jail and it will not be on any phony charge either! it will be for life!
now do not get excited, hildy! i do not know what you are talking about -- but is this mr. baldwin's wallet?
you know it is!
i did not frisk him. he must have dropped it in burns' office. i did not know whose it was.
no -- and you do not know that your cheap boss has had mr. baldwin arrested again -- do you?
what -- already? why, the dame left only a minute before i did!
you are not going to phone anybody where i am.
put down that gun, earl.
you are not going to shoot me, earl. I am your friend, remember? I have got to write that story about your "production for use".
yes -- that is right. production for use.
earl, you do not want to hurt your friends, do you?
do not move!
maybe you are my friend and maybe you are not -- but do not come any nearer. you can not trust anybody in this crazy world. say, I will bet i could shoot you from here.
sure you could, earl -- but you would not want to do that, would you? you would not want to kill anybody.
no, no, you are right. i do not want to kill anybody. all i want to do is be let alone.
earl, there is just one thing i ought to clear up for the interview.
what is that? only -- you are getting too near. i do not trust anybody.
i do not blame you, earl.  if i were in your place i would not trust anybody, either.
keep away!
earl, you must never do that again.
oh, I am awful tired. i could not go through another day like this.
well, maybe you think i could!
do not talk too loud.
wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they do not understand. callin' me a bolshevik. I am an anarchist. it is got nothin' to do with bombs. it is the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. you see that, do not you?
sure i do, earl.
where are they gone? you know where they are?
wait a minute, mollie.
they got him surrounded some place -- gonna shoot him like a dog!
mollie, they have not got him. you got to help me, mollie! we have got to do something!
what do you mean?
what is that?
quiet, mollie!
there is somethin' funny going on around here.
quiet, mollie, quiet!
do not cry, mollie, there is nothing to cry about.
how did you get here, earl?
down the drainpipe. i did not mean to shoot him. you believe me, do not you, mollie?
stop screaming, mollie or we are sunk. I am trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
let 'em take me. it is better that way.
they will get him! they will get him!
ssh!
who locked the door?
just a second, mike ---  mollie, i got it!
what good'll it do?
we will get you out in ten minutes.
open up there, will you!
all right -- all right!
I am coming!  keep dead quiet. do not even breathe.
I will be right here. i will not leave you.
hey!
mollie, drop down here! you have fainted!
what is the idea?
never mind! just play dead.
hey --
shut up, you!
kind of exclusive, am not you? we got calls to make, you know.
run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
mollie malloy -- what happened to her?
came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I have been trying to get her to come to.
she looks as though she is going to come to.
give me a hand with her, will you?
okay.  up you go, mollie.
hildy, i thought you were gone --
well -- i was going, but mollie fainted away and i thought i ought to do what i could.
some hallowe'en goin' on outside. the whole police force standing on it is ear.
what a chase!
no luck on williams, yet -- call you back.
any news?
yeah. i was never so tired in my life.
are you all right, now?
yeah, I am feelin' fine.
sure, mollie, you never looked better in your life.
yeah, hold the line. hey, this looks good. an old lady just called the detective bureau and claims williams is hiding in her cellar. well - we have looked every other place. want to go out on it?
a fine bunch of reporters. biggest story in two years and they are too lazy to go after it.
it is easy for you to talk. you are retired. we are still working.
okay.  forget it.
what is the matter with you boys? afraid it might rain? if you want to go, I will cover this end.
say, hildy, if i know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. are you trying to scoop us or something?
something smells around here. if you ask me mollie gave her the story on how williams got that gun.  did you smuggle that gun into williams, mollie?
better let us in on it, mollie.
aw, why do not you let her alone? she is ill!
oh, you two are pals now -- i think you are right, endicott. mollie did give her some kind of story.
i tell you, it is a screwy set-up. we better hold onto 'em both.
mother!
do not you mother me! playing cat-and- mouse with my poor boy! keeping him looked up -- making us miss two trains -- and supposed to be married tomorrow!
mother, i can explain everything. I will go with you in five minutes and --
you do not have to go with me at all! just give me my son's money and you can stay here forever as far as I am concerned. stay with that murderer you caught!
i do not know what she is talking about. i never said any such thing.
I am quoting my son, and he has never lied to me.
you am not gettin' out o' here!
now, where is he?
come on, you! before we slap you down.
do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
where is he, before we beat it out of you?
get the cops, somebody.
come on, fellas.
walter! d-did you see --  -- that?
yes. where is he?
she jumped out of the window.
i know. where is he, i said.
louie, take this lady over to polack mike's and lock her up. see that she does not take to anyone on the way.
what is that -- what is that?
wait a minute, walter. you can not do that!
my name is louis peluso.
where do you think you are going?
let go o' me! I have got to get bruce out of jail! oh, walter, why did you have to do this to me?
get bruce out of jail! how can you worry about a man who is resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? hildy, this is war! you can not desert now!
oh, get off that trapeze!  there is your story! smear it all over the front page -- earl williams caught by the morning post! and take all the credit -- i covered your story for you and i got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I am getting out! i know i told you that twice before today -- but this time i mean it!
you drooling idiot! what do you mean, you are getting out! there are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- once in a lifetime! hildy, you have got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
i know, but --
you know! you have got the brain of a pancake! that was not just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! hildy! this is the greatest yarn in journalism since livingstone discovered stanley for the new york herald!
wait a minute -- was not it stanley who discovered livingstone?
do not get technical at a time like this! do you realize what you have done? you have taken a city that is been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you are kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that new york's having under la guardia! we will make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
I would like to think.
well, think it then, because it is true! we will crucify that mob. we are going to keep williams under cover till morning so the post can break the story exclusive. then we will let the governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
i get it!
you have kicked over the whole city hall like an apple-cart. you have got the mayor and hartman backed against a wall. you have put one administration out and another in. this is not a newspaper story -- it is a career! and you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight of the clock train or a nine of the clock train! still a doll-faced mugg! that is all you are.
let me get at that typewriter and I will show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
attagirl! why, they will be naming streets after you -- hildy johnson street! there'll be statues of you in the parks, hildy. the radio'll be after you -- the movies!  by tomorrow morning I will betcha there is a hildy johnson cigar! i can see the billboards now. light up with hildy johnson!
whoa -- wait a minute. we can not leave williams here. one of the other fellows'll --
we are going to take him over to my private office.  where is our phone?
that one -- how you going to take him? they will see him.
not if he is inside the desk. we will carry the desk over.  give me duffy!
you can not take that desk out. it is crawling with cops outside.
we will lower it out of the window with pulleys. quit stallin'.
hildy!
huh!
get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? snap into it!
how much do you want on it?
all the words you have got.
where is some paper?
can i call the mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
call him a love-child, if you want to.  duffy!
how about the time he had his house painted by the fire department?
give him the works.  hello, duffy, get set! we have got the biggest story in the world. earl williams caught by the morning post -- exclusive!
hildy!
what the devil do you want? listen, bruce, you can not come in here now! we are busy!  where you been, duffy? stick around! what? what chinese earthquake? the deuce with it... what is that?
hildy!
hello, bruce...
bruce!! how did you get out?
not through any help of yours, hildy.
bruce, i know, but i was in the biggest jam --
for pete's sake, hildy, they are waiting for the rest of that story!
okay, walter.
i waited and waited and then i had an idea and wired albany to send me a hundred dollars so i could get out on bail...  i do not know what they will think -- they sent it to the police station!
we will explain the whole thing to them.
i know i got you into this, hildy, but it does seem to me that you can not care much for me if you are willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
bruce, you know I am mad about you and stop talking like that.  walter!
no -- i was just talking to one of the guys at the office.
oh.  i wonder what is keeping mother? she was supposed to come down and get you.
oh, she was here.
where did she go?
out some place.
hildy! where is mother?
oh -- mother -- she -- i do not know where she went.
did you give her the money?
no, i was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
then suppose you give me the money. four hundred and fifty dollars.
oh, yes. here it is.
here it is, bruce. one -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
thank you.
and I will take that certified check, too. I have decided i can handle things around here...
come on, hildy, we have got to keep going! sorry, bruce, but --
just a second, walter. here, bruce, here's the check... and, oh, bruce, here's your wallet. i got it back.
you got it back, eh? there is something funny going on around here.
hildy!
all right, walter.
I am taking the nine of the clock train, hildy. and you can meet us at the station.
fine.
I will see she is there, bruce, i promise you.
if she is not there, mother and i are leaving anyhow!
i know how you feel, bruce, but you have got to forgive her. she is only a woman, after all.
suppose she is -- i have feelings, too! do you know where I have been for the last couple of hours? locked up in a police station and she did not move to do anything about it.
ts! ts! ts!
and now i do not know where my mother is. she may be lost.
I will find her, bruce, if i have to put every detective in the city on the job. tell you what -- go over to the missing persons bureau and describe your mother. what does she look like?
she is -- well, she is very motherly. that is about the best description i know.
that is the kind of stuff they want!
oh, bruce, let me see that money hildy gave you.
the money? why?
there is a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
gee! take a look, will you?
oh, this is all right, bruce. i just wanted to be sure.
say, i want to be sure, too!
listen, did you impress it on butch that i want him and his gang here right away? you did? every minute counts. all right.  duffy's getting old!
where is butch?
well, keep going! we want an extra out on the streets before it is too late!
where is bruce?
bruce? oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
what tickets?
railroad tickets.
is he coming back here?
did not you hear him? of course he is coming back here. keep going, will you?
who is it?
what is the idea of locking this?
that is bensinger. that is his desk.
bensinger -- of the tribune.
open this door!
am not you got any more sense than to -- ?  oh, h-hello, mr. burns. why, quite an honor having you come over here.
hello, bensinger.
excuse me, i just want to --
how do you mean?
i was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our mister duffy.
nothing -- ah -- detrimental, i hope.
i should say not! that was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
oh, did you -- care for the poem, mr. burns?
the poem?... the poem was great!
remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, but in his heart he hears the hangman calling and the gallows falling and his white-haired mother's tears..."
heartbreaking! how would you like to work for me?
what?
duffy! I am sending bensinger over to see you.  mervyn, is not it?
no. roy. roy v.
of course!  roy bensinger, the poet. of course you would not know! you probably never heard of shakespeare, either! put mr. bensinger right on the staff.  how much are you getting on the tribune, roy?
seventy-five.
I will give you a hundred and a by- line.
let him have everything he wants.  now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man.  he hides, cowering... afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... and all the time they are closing in... get the sense of an animal at bay!
sort of a jack london style?
exactly!
i got my rhyming dictionary in --
it does not have to rhyme!
I will keep you in mind.
au revoir, mon capitaine.
bon jour!
double-crossing swine!
you said it! but this'll teach him a lesson. he will not quit his paper without giving notice after this.
tear into it, will you? do not sit there like a frozen robin!
I am finished.
finished!
bruce ought to be back by now. walter, you are not trying anything again, are you?
hildy, you think i could? after this story?  here! you are just nervous.
where is mrs. baldwin?
what did you do with her?
what happened?
you been in a fight?
down western avenue. we were going sixty-five miles an hour. you know what i mean?
take that mush out of your mouth!
where is the old lady?
I am telling you!
we run smack into a police patrol. you know what i mean? we broke it in half!
oh-h-h... was she hurt?
where is she? tell me!
louie!
I am telling you. can you imagine bumping into a load of cops?! they come rollin' out like oranges!
what did you do with her?
search me! when i come to i was running down thirty-fifth street.
-- you were with her. you were in the cab, were not you?
was i? the driver got knocked cold.
butter-fingers! i give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
what do you mean, i handed her? the patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street.
now everything's fine. she is probably squawking her head off in some police station.
i do not think she is talking much... you know what i mean?
do not tell me -- was she killed?
was she? did you notice?
it is fate, hildy. what will be, will be.
what am i going to say to bruce? what will i tell him?
if he really loves you, you will not have to tell him anything.  snap out of it! would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
i killed her. I am responsible. oh- h... what can i do now? how can i ever face him? oh, i hope he never comes back!
look at me, hildy --
I am looking at you -- you murderer!
if it was my own mother, I would carry on! you know i would. for the paper!
louie, where did it happen? I am going out!
you stay here. I will find out everything.
western an' thirty-fourth.
hello -- hello...
gimme western four-five-five-seven.
who?  hello, butch! where are you?
mission hospital? gimme the receiving room.
what are you doing there? have not you even started?
hello -- eddie? hildy johnson. was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
oh, for --  h. sebastian -- butch! listen, it is a matter of life and death! listen!
nobody?  morningside three-one-two-four.
i can not hear... you got who? speak up! a what?... you can not stop for a dame now!
is this the community hospital?
i do not care if you have been after her for six years! butch, our whole lives are at stake! are you going to let a woman come between us after all we have been through?
hello, max, hildy johnson. was there an old lady --?
butch! I would put my arm in fire for you -- up to here!  now, you can not double-cross me!... she does? all right -- put her on. I will talk to her... hello! oh, hello, madam... now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can not keep butch away from his duty... what is that? you say that again and I will come over there and knock your eye out! hello?  I will kill 'em! I will kill both of 'em!  duffy!  mousing around with some big blonde annie on my time! that is co-operation!  duffy!!
shut up, will you?  you sure? nobody?
duffy!!!!   duffy!!!!  well, where is duffy?  diabetes! i ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease.  louie.
anything you want, boss.
beat it out and get hold of some guys.
who do you want?
anybody with hair on his chest. get 'em off the street -- anywhere. offer them anything -- only get them.  we have got to get this desk out of here.
you know me. the shirt off my back.
you got plenty of money?
sure, boss.
i mean real money -- not counterfeit!
i always have both.
lafayette two-one-hundred.
that dumb immigrant'll flop on me. i know it.  can you imagine butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
ring that number, will you?
come here. see if we can move it.
hello -- hello! is this the lying -- in hospital? did you have an auto accident in the last --
will you come here?
oh, i see. i beg your pardon.
when I am surrounded, with my back against the wall, you are not going to lay down on me, are you --
yes.
hildy, you just can not leave me out on a limb now. it -- it would not be cricket!
i do not care what you say. I am going to find bruce's mother.  oh-h...  I am going out and find her!
do not open that!
who says so? I am going to the morgue -- to look --
there she is!
say, hildy...
just a minute, johnson!
let go o' me. what is the idea?
what is your hurry?
we want to see you.
take your paws off me!
hold her, boys!
who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
you can not bluff me, burns. i do not care who you are or what paper you are editor of.
let me go!  fellows, something is happened to my mother-in-law.
hang onto her! keep her in here!
we know what you are up to.
probably goin' out to get williams.
the door was locked.
she and mollie were talking.
i do not know anything, i tell you. there is been an accident.
johnson, there is something very peculiar going on.
you can send somebody with me if you do not believe me!
i was not born yesterday. now the boys tell me you and this mollie malloy --
nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I am getting out of here and you can not stop me!
if you have any accusations to make, hartman, make them in the proper manner. otherwise, I will have to ask you to get out.
you will ask me to what?
get out!
close that door. do not let anybody in or out.
come on, pinky! give 'em a little third degree.
make them talk and you got williams, pinky!
johnson, I am going to the bottom of this. what do you know about williams? are you going to talk or are not you?
what do i know about williams?
all right, boys. take her along. i got ways of making her talk.
look out, you --
what is the use of fighting, hildy?
no, you don't! walter!
what is it? here!
where did you get this?
I have got a right to carry a gun if i want to.
not this gun!
i can explain that, hartman. when hildy told me she wanted to interview earl williams i thought it might be dangerous and i gave her a gun to defend herself.
oh, you did! well, that is very, very interesting. this happens to be the gun that earl williams shot his way out with!
you are barking up the wrong tree, hartman.
I will give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
he went over to the hospital to call on professor egelhoffer.
what?
with a bag of marshmallows.
no? well --  johnson, you are under arrest.  you, too, burns.
who is under arrest? you pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you are doing?
I will show you what I am doing. burns, you are guilty of obstructing justice and so is the morning post. I am going to see that the post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
you will see nothing of the kind, sheriff.
we will just start by impounding the post property.  is that your desk?
no!
yes! what are you afraid of hildy? i dare him to move that desk out of here.
hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I will put you behind bars.
you will, eh? well, we will see about that.  all right, boys. take it.
I am warning you -- it will be a federal offense.  and you will be an accessory!
we will take a chance on that, burns.  go ahead, boys.
mother!
that man there!
mother! oh, I am so glad to see you! are you all right? tell me.
are you referring to me, madam?
you know you did!
what about this, burns? kidnapping, eh?
oh, trying to frame me, eh! i never saw this woman before in my life!
come on, sheriff. we have got to get bail.
i was in here -- and they had some kind of murderer in with them. they were hiding him!
hiding him where?
mother!
he is harmless.
do not take any chances. shoot through the desk.
he can not hurt anybody. you have got his gun.
oh, dear! oh, dear!
you grey-haired old judas!
let me out! let me out of here!
call duffy!
no, you don't!
do you want to get us scooped?
that is murder!
all right! carl! frank! one of you get on each side of the desk. take hold of the cover.
hold the phone!
I will have it in a minute.
got you, williams!
go on -- shoot me!
williams put up a desperate struggle but the police overpowered --
-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun would not work, so --
fine work, pete! you certainly delivered the goods. I am proud of you.
look kind o' natural, do not they, fred?
a sight for sore eyes!
aiding an escaped criminal! and a little charge of kidnapping I am looking into.  but that is the jail! there must be somebody there!
well! looks like about ten years apiece for you birds!
does it? you forget the power that always watches over the morning post.
your luck's not with you now!
you are going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we are pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
give me the district attorney's office.  I will tell you what you will be doing -- making brooms in the state penitentiary.  hello, d'arrasty! this is hartwell. come over to my office, will you? I have just arrested a couple of important birds and i want to take their confessions.
duffy! get liebowitz!
all the lawyers in the world are not going to help you!
this is the morning post you are talking to!
the power of the press, huh!
get out of here!
you can not bribe me!
what is this?
get out of here, you!
who is this man?
throw him out, frank.
they would not take it.
you are insane!
you drunken idiot! arrest him! the idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
it is a frame-up! some imposter!
wait a minute!  let go there!
murder, uh?
hanging an innocent man to win an election!
that is a lie!!
i never saw him before!
when did you deliver this first?
who did you talk to?
that is absurd on the face of it, mr. burns! he is talking like a child.
out of the mouths of babes.
he is insane or drunk or something. why, if this unfortunate man, williams, has really been reprieved, i personally am tickled to death. are not you, pete?
take those handcuffs off our friends, pete. that was not at all necessary.
i was just going to!
walter, i can not tell you how badly i feel about this. there was no excuse for hartwell to fly off the handle.
i was only doing my duty. nothing personal in it.
save that for the tribune.
what did you say your name was -- pinkus?
here's the picture of my wife.
a very fine-looking women.
she is good enough for me! and if i was to go home and tell my wife --
i understand perfectly, mr. pinkus, and as long as i am mayor --
which ought to be about three hours more, I would say.
just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
and your arrest. you will each get about ten years, i think.
and so do i!
so do you what, you hoodoo!  and now, mr. pinkus, if you will come with us, we will take you over to the warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
how was that for a tight squeeze?
do not tell me you were worried!
worried! i was petrified. were not you?
uh-uh. as long as we were in there together pitching -- they could not lick us. well, it is been a lot of fun.
in a way.
i mean -- working together. just like the old days. the things we have been through, hildy.
we have certainly been in some swell jams.
remember the time we broke into the d.a.'s office, and copied fifi randell's diary?
yeah. what about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? six scoop interviews!
yeah - but that time we stole old lady haggerty's stomach off the coroner's physician. we proved she was poisoned though, did not we?
we sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
in the shoreland hotel. and our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
do not remind me. that is how we happened to --
sorry, hildy. i did not mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
that is all right, walter. it is as much my fault as yours.
bruce is making the nine of the clock train. i told him you would be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
well, if it is my last story, I would like it to be a good one. but -- i guess i can't, walter.
suit yourself, kid. this is not for me to decide. of course, you could make a later train and still be in albany tomorrow morning.
yeah. i suppose i could. but, walter --
he is going to have you the rest of his life, hildy. can not you give me another hour?
i do not know what to do, walter.
flip a coin.
all right.  heads i go -- tails i stay to write the story. ready?
well -- what is it?
what is the difference? I am going to write that story -- and you know it!
hildy!
do not touch me! I am not doing it for you!
then why are you doing it?
because I am a newspaper woman, heaven help me!
the greatest yarn ever written by anybody. my hat's off to you, hildy!
thanks.
and what a way to quit. while you are still champion! that is the way to leave, hildy!
yeah. only -- only I am not leaving, walter.
what do you mean? bruce'll be waiting for you in albany.
no, he won't. i wired him that i was not coming.
where did you wire him?
on the nine of the clock train. that is the one he took, is not it?
sure.
it is awfully clear now. bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. i could not do that for him, walter. I am what you made me -- a cheap reporter who would give up her soul for a story!... is that job still open?
both jobs are open, hildy. the paper -- and being mrs. walter burns.
thanks, walter, but it is no good. we tried it.
sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! only you expected it to be like other marriages. it can not be like other marriages -- we are different! we are a different world. look at what we went through today. i would not trade that for any honeymoon in the world. i bet you wouldn't, either.
a fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! and that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
that is what makes it romantic. every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. but us -- you never know where i am and I am not sure where you are. that is romance!
well, maybe I would like to know just once!
hildy, if that is what you want, all right. we will even go to -- how about niagara falls?
niagara falls! walter, you do not mean that?
sure i do. and I will tell you something else -- I would like a baby.
walter!
sure, i can not last forever. i want a son i can train to take my place on this paper.
what would you do if it was a daughter?
well, if she looked like you -- say! my brains and your looks -- that might not be such a bad combination.
what is the matter with my brains?
what is the good of arguing about something that probably does not exist? look, hildy, I am proposing to you. what do you say?
well, I would like to be lady-like and think it over.
i do not want to rush you. take a couple of seconds.
what!
now do not argue, hildy.  how about it, judge?
nobody's going to rush me into anything!  you keep away from me!
all right, judge.
that is what he said the last time. do not believe him, judge.
hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
you are not fooling anybody.
how about bruce's?
walter, you can not do that!
sure, i can. look at the policy i gave him!  "with this ring i thee wed and with all my worldly goods i thee endow: and thereto i plight thee my troth."
hildy, darling!
yes -- 'hildy, darling'. I am just a fool. that is what i am. i know what it is going to be like.
it will be heaven!
sure, heaven! you have probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
but, hildy -- i can explain --
you -- you!!
