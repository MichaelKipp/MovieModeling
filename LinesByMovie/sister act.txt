come on -- stay.  just a little.  we can talk, i'll get a pizza.  pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  and you still haven't told me what happened.  what did she say?
what did who say?
who?  the other woman.  your wife.
you are so damn sexy.
vince...
how did i get so lucky?  what is it now, five years we've been together?  who do i thank?
today was the deadline, vince.
i want us to be together.  like people. honest, decent people.  in the eyes of god.  babe, today... i went to confession.
you did what?
for the first time in i don't know how long.  i wanted everything done right. open and above board.  i told father antonelli i was in love.  i told him it was a special love, for all the ages.
you said that?  and what did he say? did he say you could leave her?  did he say we'd be happy?
he said that if i got a divorce i'd burn in hell.  for all eternity.
what?
you want me to go against a priest?  get excommunicated?  you think i'm nuts?
you bastard!
we can still see each other.  just like always.  it's a different kind of sin. smaller.
you pig!
babe, it's not me!  i love you!  it's god!
you lying sleazeball!  the best years of my life!  what am i, garbage?  am i lint?
oh, girls.
yes, betty?
this prom is a real drag.
oh-huh.
oh my!
what is it, betty?
look at that.  get a gander.
oh my!
he's so dreamy.  he's like... a greek god.  he's the cutest guy here.    he's boss.  he's fab.  he's...
yes, betty?
he's so fine.
d00-lang, doo-lang, d00-lang.
wish he was mine.  that handsome boy over there, the one with the wavy hair.
what do you want?  this is a private area!  get lost!
you ain't got nothin' i ain't seen.
then stop trying to memorize it.  hit the road.
his ashes?
with love.
from vince?  what a guy.  doo-lang, doo- lang.
at least he's not a cop.  at least he can afford a decent gift.
i used to buy.you,..stuff.  on your birthday .  when we were seeing each other.
yeah, like what?  quilted coat hangers, that your mother picked out?  lottery tickets?  a travel iron?
so i don't shop.
'cause you're always out, arresting people.  making trouble.  i don't know why i went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  i couldn't hold my head up, i used to tell people you were a security guard!
oh, yeah? well, how do you think i felt? you were singing in bowling alleys back then.  i told people you were a hooker!
he's a businessman.
a what? when are you qonna wake up?
when are you gonna get off my case? have you got a search warrant?  what do you want -- cheap thrills?
information, baby.  i thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
think again!  and get out of here.
no... it's fine.
yes?
thanks.  a lot.
is that why you came up here, christy? to thank me?
sure.
and to say you're sorry.  about this afternoon.  and the things you said. forgotten.  completely.  do you understand?  forgotten.
right.  yeah.  forgotten.
vince -- is she... okay?
maybe.
i mean, won't she talk? she seemed kind of upset.
she did.  bring her back.  now.  for a talk.
and if she runs?
take care of it.
right between the eyes!  down and out! the guy was gone!  i... i couldn't believe it!
you couldn't believe it?  vince the prince?
i never said he was an altar boy, okay? but he sent his goons after me!  they tried to kill me!  i'm not kidding!
i don't know anything about bodies!  i mean, he didn't bring it home.  he was good to me... sometimes.  he was sweet. he took care of me.  who am i supposed to go out with?  he owns a casino.  he let me sing.
he didn't do you a favor.
screw you!
we could put you into our witness protection program.
a hiding place.
and if i don't?
then-you run.
then one day they find you.
they open a window.
ten flights?
you'd lose.  you'd die.  all over the sidewalk.  and into the street.
all right!  i get the picture!  i'll do it!  i'll testify!
get a stenographer.
okay, here's what i want.  i know about this stuff.  a five-star hotel.  with room service.
maybe hawaii.
jesus, what do you think this is -- wheel of fortune?  let me spell it out for you.  you have to hide like you don't even exist.  you have to get so far hidden away that you never see sunlight.
okay -- no limo.
no nothing.
what're you gonna do, put me in a bag and bury me?
i'm gonna put you in the last place on earth that vince would ever look for you.
i hate you.  i totally hate you.
safest place in the world.  you think vince would look for you here?
nuns, eddie.  there are nuns here. everywhere.  it's crawling with 'em.
it's a convent.  all you have to do is shut up, behave yourself, and get along.
with nuns?  with rulers?  no way.  i'm gonna go back, work things out with vince.
and one bullet.  that's all it's gonna take.
but vince has contacts all over the place!  this is san francisco!  they'll be looking for me!
everywhere but this little hole-in-the- wall convent.  nobody knows you're here but me.  we're trying to get a quick court date.  a month, maybe two, tops. i'll spring you as soon as i can.
i can't stay here!  i'll crack up! eddie, what am i gonna do?
pray.
absolutely not.  i am very sorry, but no.
we can save this young woman's life, and imprison a parasite -- all in one gesture.
but she's been exposed to the underside of life.  she is the underside of life.
and therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
we're a small convent, bishop.  surely there are... more appropriate shelters.
your small convent is in danger of closing, reverend mother.  the las vegas police department has offered to make a generous financial donation.
but, bishop...
st. katherine's is a benedictine order. you have taken a vow of hospitality.  to all in need.
i lied.
i know.
a convent?  they put me in a convent? what's the problem?  wasn't there any more room in hell?
what is your full name?  your christian name?
mother theresa.  gandhi.  don't you understand?  this is all a mistake.  i'm the good guy.  i'm the witness.  and i'm being punished!
your name?
christy.  christy van cartier.
enough joking.
that's my real name!  currently i'm a singer.  sort of.
very well.
oh my god.  this isn't happening, tell me this isn't happening.  it's a nightmare, i'm back at st. anne's!
st. anne's?
parochial school.  akron.  st. android's.
you were unhappy?
i was expelled!  when i was fifteen?
the reason?
beats me!  what do you think?  smoking! heavy petting, without a chaperone. heavy petting, with the chaperone.  and wearing a black bra, under my uniform.  the demon bra.
i see.
you see?  you see?  i have to get out of here   i have to make a phone call. don't you get  it?  i'm in a convent! you're a nun!
sit down.
what?
miss van cartier.
what?
your cigarette -- out.
it has come to pass.
what?
i joined this convent some thirty years ago.  at that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  and hope.  our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  and, as the years have passed, i have watched that promise destroyed.  drugs.  gangs.  spandex.  and. so i have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. and now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
are you talking about me?
and all those like you.
you mean black people?
absolutely not.  i mean the wicked.  the heedless.  and their las vegas concubines.
what's a concubine?
check your driver's license.
fine.  got it.  look, the way i see it, i'm stuck here, right?  i mean, i'm here or i'm target practice.  so here's the deal -- i don't bug you, you don't bug me.  i'll catch up on some sleep, watch some tube, lay back and lay low.  so just get me a key and show me to my room, and do not disturb.  capisce?
of course.  but it's almost lunch.
cool.  is there a menu?  or buffet?
before we do, you might like to freshen up.  and you'll certainly want to change
deal.
how about a robe?  one of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "guest of st. katherine's"
would you like that?
excused.  open the cabinet to your left. you will find appropriate attire.
can do.
no!  no!  i can't do this!
normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  while you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. only i shall know who, and what, you truly are.  you will not disrupt the convent.  you will not influence the sisters with your colorful street talk. you will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
but look at rites  look at this!  i'm a nun!  i'm invisible!  i'm a penguin!
as of now, and until you leave, you are sister mary clarence.
mary clarence?  like a guy?  like a dumb guy?
the mary is in deference to the holy mother, the clarence in honor of saint clarence loyola.  there are three vows that every nun must accept.  the vow of poverty...
no problem.
the vow of obedience.
like to who?
and the vow of chastity.
i'm outta here.
yes, mary patrick?
reverend mother, on behalf of the sisters, i'd like to welcome mary clarence to st. katherine's.
sisters, for the rest of the day we shall declare a vow of silence.
a what?
surely you are familiar with this practice, mary clarence.  only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
silence?  no talking?  all day?
until sundown.
as a new member of our order, i think you might also enjoy a ritual fast.
a what?
a fast.  to remind us of the poor, of those who must endure without enough to eat.
no food?
no food.  not until sundown.
he's so damn cocky.  this is different.
it's a bluff, vince.
you know so much.  they've got christy, and we've got to find her.  get her 8x10, from in front of the lounge.  fax it to every contact we got.
is this all the food i get?
yes.  until breakfast.
that's tomorrow!  don't you have any snacks?  machines?
this shall be your cell, mary clarence.
my what?
your cell.  your room.
you were right the first time.  is this like, solitary?  the cooler?  where's the furniture?
our lives are simple.  we have little need for material possessions.
right, sure thing.  but what about, like, appliances?  like a little color portable?  boom box?
useless distractions.
it's like the stone age.  the room time forgot.  what about a phone?
and whom would you call?
oh, i don't know... satan?
your cell is more than adequate.
right.  so what do we do now?  ping- pong?  row over to the monastery?
it is nine p.m.  pleasant dreams.
wait.  no.  you're kidding.  lights out? at nine?  my day's just starting.
i'm sure.  if i were you, i would use this time, to think about my life.  and its direction.  or lack thereof.
what's wrong with my life?
from all i've heard, just about everything.  your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead.
come on, we're late.
what?  what time is it?
it's after five.  we have to bathe.
five a.m.?
isn't it a glorious morning?  good morning, mary clarence.  sleep well?
right.
is this like your old convent?
which convent was that, sister?
which convent?  it was, um, the little sisters... of the moonlight.  in vegas. everybody used to come to mass.  frank. dean.  sammy.  right at ringside.
enough jabber.
what?
progressive convents.  vanity.  it sounds awful.  it sounds just like this place.
like this place?
i like my old convent, in vancouver. out in the woods.  it wasn't all modern, like here.  no electricity.  cold water. bare feet.  those were nuns.  it was hell on earth, but i loved it.  this place is a hilton.
where did that come from?
i haven't heard that song in ages.  the ronettes?
shirelles.
you know that song?
1961?  '62?  mary clarence, that's when many of us took final vows.  it's the last secular music we recall.
no. hey -- he knows that you been creating now you're gonna get a beating
jesus.  data-base hoods.  it's a wonderful world.  beloved daughter missing.  reward of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars. please find our adored angel, we miss her so.  dead or alive.
vince is getting desperate.  where is she, eddie?  where'd you stash her?
where's who?
you won't even tell us?
i wouldn't even tell the pope.
sister mary patrick?
yes?
i need to see you, at once.  girls, please excuse sister mary patrick for a few moments.  mary clarence?
yeah?
girls, this is sister mary clarence. she'll be minding you until sister mary patrick's return.  mary clarence, please assign a biblical passage.  do not attempt discussion.  am i understood?
i got it.
come, sister.
so, hi there.  i'm... sister mary clarence.  and you're... young christians.  i guess i should assign you this passage.  what's good?  what were you talking about?
we were talking about the wild thing. teen promiscuity.
really.
yeah.  sister mary pat was discussing it.  you know she thinks it's a sin.
well... yes.  yes it is.
how come?  sister?
well... because it's in the bible. "thou shalt not..."  thou shalt not.
excuse me -- just what are you all doing here?  at sunday school?
'cause we love it so damn much.  and cause we gotta come here.  probation.
probation?
yeah.  we all got caught.  shoplifting. cuttin' school.  cuttin' up some bitch with a blade.  so we gotta come here.  so we'll be good, in the future.  so we'll learn valuable lessons.  and i learned mine.  i will be incredibly good, i will never rip out nobody's nose-ring by accident ever again.  can i go now?
yeah, you learned a whole lot, i can tell.
okay, so maybe i'm a nun -- so, you want to ask me something?  you want to listen, for once in your little lives? you want to pay some attention?
what about crack?  you a user?
i said i was a nun, not an asshole.
well, what about the sex stuff?  what if some dude is after you, and he's always saying stuff, commin' on sweet and mellow.  like, oh, baby, you know you'll love it.  oh, baby, if you loved me, you'd stay.
and you listen to that?
no, but... i don't know... sometimes.
hey, i know, it's hard.  but do what i do.
what you do?
just tell him, i do love you, but i can't -- i'm a nun.
deal with it, sweet thing.  it's important, nowadays.  you just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
mary clarence!
a balloon and a banana!  tell me, mary clarence, what were you thinking?
those girls were asking questions. they've got it rough.  i wish somebody had talked to me about that stuff when was their age.  i wish somebody would talk to me about it now.
this is a convent, not a clinic.  we offer moral guidance, not hardware.
have you been out in those streets?  do you know what those kids are up against? you should help them!
we are nuns.  we seek solutions through prayer.
sometimes it's not enough!
you are correct.  sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  such as your own, for example.  how do you feel about physical labor?
it never solves anything.
do your recall the words of saint peter, in ecciesiastes 1:27?  he spoke unto a wastrel youth.  he said, "take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
in english?
how to put it... ah, of course, mary clarence.  "no pain, no gain."
soon, you gorgeous thing... tell me... how lonely?
it's that call you were expecting, vince.
can you hold?  can you try?
the minute i saw you. i said to myself, she's a weaver.  have you ever used a loom?
not in years.
well, it all comes back, in just a jiffy.  i'm working on a wall-hanging, of the convent.
why?
to sell, of course.  i hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at st. katherine's.  we need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
but don't you get money?  from the vatican?
mary clarence.  goose.  we're completely self-supporting.  like all convents. like yours.
oh, right.  at my old place, we used to... wash cars.  groom dogs.  so... nice loom.
isn't it lovely?  now i'll demonstrate, and then you can hop right in.  you just draw your beater in, keep it pressed against the pick, and open the shed.  then pass your shuttle, beat, and open the next shed.  shuttle. beat, beat, shuttle, beat, shed.  keep tension on the warp.  is that clear?
just about.  show me again.
you betcha.
shuttle, beat, shed.  and watch your heddles.
i love my heddles.  show me again.
mary clarence -- how is your weaving progressing?
oh, she's doing just fine, reverend mother -
really catching on.
good.  mary patrick, i need you in the office.  mary clarence, carry on.
i'm sorry, i'm not a weaver!
months of work, and the loom, absolutely ruined!
look, this isn't my kind of thing!  i wasn't cut out to make little tapestries, or knit little sweaters! i don't do that! i'm a star!
eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
not again.  you can't keep calling. somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
but i'm going insane!  all these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  i don't get it -- when's the weekend? they have gruel, eddie, that's what they call food!  gruel -- it's like alpo for nuns! i sleep in a cell, on a board, and i pray five times a days  do you know what i pray for, eddie, do you have any idea? check your crotch, eddie --anything fall off yet?  get me outta her!
calm down.  look, i didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately.
like what?
keeping our witnesses alive.  we hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead.
you son-of-a-bitch!
i just need a few more weeks,
but it's a nightmare!  mother superior is out to get me!  she hates my guts! she keeps thinking up new kinds of torture!
do you hear that?  that choir?  eddie, in here, that's what they call music!
don't call again.  it's not safe.  i'll be in touch.
what?  what does she want now?  i did the dishes.  i oiled the pews.  i dusted the hymnals.  two hundred hymnals.  why can't people share?
i... i...
what?
i... i brought you something.
a cigarette?
an extra heel of bread.  please take it, you need your strength.  you've been working so hard.
thanks.  so which one are you? sister bruce?  sister doug?
mary robert.  i'm... mary robert.
right.  okay.  bob.  nice to know you.
so, bob, how long have you been in? st. k's?
three years.  sister.
three years.  a rookie.
a novice.
yeah, like a learner's permit, right? when do you hit the big time?  you know, when do you take the final vows?
you have to help me
right, sure, but what's the problem? are they keeping you a prisoner here? do they drug you?  did reverend mother like, kidnap your parents?  we can call the enquirer.
no, you don't understand -- i don't want to get out!  i want to get in?
excuse me?
oh. mary clarence, i'm so unworthy.  i want to take my final vows, i would do it tomorrow, but reverend mother won't let me!
she won't?  why not?
she says i should wait.  she says that no one should become a nun as an escape from life.  she says that i'm not experienced enough to make the decision yet.  in a mature manner.
she said that?  reverend mother?
well, then there's only one thing to do.
what?
reverend mother says you need experience, right, in life.  in order to make a responsible decision.  this is going to be very painful for me.  you know how much i love this little room. this whole convent.  wait.
we must do this sacred thing, mary robert.
of course!  we must do it!  it's the will of god!  what is it?
we must... get you some experience.  we must... leave this place.
are you sure?
mary clarence!
now you.
how are you doing.
hey, sisters.  are you going in there?
you know it.
we need experience.
it's part of st. katherine's new community outreach program.  how old are you?  you shouldn't be smoking.  have you ever seen a diseased lung?  hand 'em over.
bobs
experience!  right?
right.
i have to do this.  so i can become a nun.
initiation.  you understand.  later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.
really?
who are all these people?
this is your neighborhood.  your turf. you should get to know 'em.
i'm getting experience.
you watch yourself!
those people are wonderful!  why don't we ever see them in church?
good point.  especially that dude you were with.  i'd like to see him down front.
mary clarence!  you're so... different from the other sisters.  sometimes, well... sometimes you sound more like a layperson.
honey.
i can't wait to tell reverend mother about all my experiences.  i've learned so much.
well, you know, you don't have to tell her everything.  i mean, nothing really happened.  we just... took a walk.
mary clarence!
keep moving!
goddamn it!
mary clarence!
oh my lord!
experience!
what was all that?  who was that man? why would he shoot at us?
i don't know, some people just don't like nuns.  i wish i had a ruler.
we could have been killed!  but you saved me!  thank you, mary clarence!
what'd she say?
you blew it -- big time.  she doesn't want you back.
does she know people are trying to kill me out there?
she's counting on it.  she's concerned for your safety, but she wants me to try and find another convent that will take you. or a carnival.
so what am i supposed to do in the meantime?
go in and talk to her.  it can't hurt.  go.
so... hi there.
i don't believe we have anything to say to each other.
look... i know i shouldn't have, i'm incredibly sorry about mary robert, i wasn't thinking, i didn't know that would happen!
mary robert's life was in danger! your behavior was inexcusable!
i know!  i'm sorry   i didn't mean for it to happen!  and i was the one they were shooting at!
mary clarence, i have given you every opportunity.  to change.  to make a decent life for yourself.
a decent life?  excuse me?  as what?  a janitor?
clearly, you have learned nothing. and you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
but you can't kick me out!  guys want to kill me!  you're a nun!  a big nun! aren't you supposed to have compassion? for the wayward sheep?  i mean, i'm a major sinner!  all-time great!  hall of fame!  aren't i, like, your dream come true?  your olympic event?
mary clarence, perhaps you are correct.
i am?
you may stay.  but i shall restrict your activities to but a single task.
what?
you have, i believe, some minimal background in music.  therefore, you are to join our choir.
you will sing, and you will sleep,' that is your schedule until you depart.  as almost no one attends mass, you will be unable to cause further damage.
no.  no.
you're my olympic event.
not the choir, please, anything but that.  the choir -- i mean, have you heard them?  i'll do anything, scrub floors, toilets, you name it, but not that i
the choir, mary clarence.  go for the gold.
is this... choir practice?
sure is!  come on in, and sing a spell.
mary robert, i am so sorry about last night...
now stop that.  you didn't shoot at me. you were only trying to help, to give me experience.  i tried to explain that to reverend mother, but -- i don't know if she understood.
soprano or alto?
whatever.
we're looking for mike.
you found him -- but we're not open yet.
i'm sorry -- i don't know what gets into him.
who are you guys?
we're the guys from vegas.  you had christy last night, but you let her get away.  it's upsetting.
but you didn't tell me!
we didn't tell you what?
that she's a nun!  that chick you're looking for -- she's a nun!
a nun?
i'm telling you!
mary clarence, are you with us?
um, i don't really know this one...
mary clarence has a background in music. that's what reverend mother said.
really, mary clarence?  were you a choirmistress?
sure.  kind of... free-lance.
free-lance?  oh really?  you think i don't see?  you think i took vows yesterday?  i know what you're up to. you and reverend mother.
what?
you're a ringer.  she brought you in to replace me.  out with the old.
hold on.
mary clarence, could you?  mary lazarus, you're terrific, but...  could you help us?
very nice.  sisters, have we learned our lesson?  i won't hold this little episode against anyone.  i'll try not to.
mary robert.
what?
mary robert, i've watched you.  you never really sing.  you whisper. nothing comes out.
i don't want to mess anyone up...
give me a c.  a c!
you see?  we've got the voices.  they're just allover the place. i've heard all of you, in the shower --you're decent. better than me.  we just need charts -- harmony -- chops.
chops?
the goods.  the sound.  the sale.  let's rearrange a few things.  mary patrick, you re not a natural soprano, you're an alto.  get over here.  mary robert --with the sopranos.
we did it!  we actually sang a chord!
that was exciting!
yeah, for one second.  that was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other.  be a group.
i knew that.
mary lazarus, i get the feeling that you like discipline.  hard work.
of course.  i'm a nun.  four popes now. the lord hates a loafer.
i hear you.  how many days a week do you rehearse?
two days.  an hour or so.
no way.  we're a choir, right? headliners.  the big room.  two days a week won't cut it.  every day.
i don't know.  mary lazarus, what do you think?  they're pretty raw.
wet behind the ears.
a bunch of real mama's girls.
it'll be hell.
tell me about it.
that machine.
i know.  it's ancient.
it's a rhythm section.  the beat.
mary patrick -- do you remember the dixie cups?
the dixie cups?  oh my.  i was just a girl.  of course.  spring is here the sun will shine
hold it.  mary patrick, you're a pretty cheerful person, aren't you?
am i?
all right, i am, i know it!  all my life, i've just been... upbeat. optimistic.  perky.  i can't help it. even when i was little, i remember my mother used to say, "that child is pure sunshine.  she'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
so use it.  when we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? celebration.  most music is.  so don't hold back.  let all that joy go right into your voice.  make me happy.  let me hear it.  perk out.  perk down.
spring is here the sun will shine i'll be his and he'll be mine we'll love until the end of time and we'll never be lonely anymore
because we're

i think they hear you!
i was thinking las vegas.  get some butts in those seats.
and what next?  popcorn?  curtain calls? this is not a theater.  or a casino.
exactly.  people like going to theaters and casinos.  but they think church is for grandma -- we could change that. pack the joint.
through blasphemy?  you have corrupted the entire choir!
hold on.  that's not fair.  i worked hard with them.  they gave up their free time, and they loved it.  those women are happy.  and we can get even better.  we can wake this place up.
out of the question.
please let me try.  i'm begging you.
and i am refusing.  as of tomorrow, mary lazarus will resume her leadership of the choir.
reverend mother, i just wanted to congratulate you.
oh?
i haven't enjoyed mass this much in years.  what a marvelous program. innovative.  inspiring.  you are to be commended.
well... thank you.
i can't wait until next sunday, when the choir performs again.  did you see the people walk right in from the street? that music, that heavenly music -- it called to them.
perhaps.
i must tell the cardinal.  i.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
really?
bless her!  there are so many problems in this neighborhood that we could help solve.  that's why many of us became nuns.  it's marvelous, reverend mother.
really...
but, bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
and you'll face that danger head-on.  as if i could stop you.  and you have my complete support in this matter. anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
we're the sisters of the sacred heart we do our bit, now do your part
honor thy mother and thy father too don't kill, don't steal, it's bad for you
don't look at your feet, and i don't want to see anybody counting.  make it look easy.  again!
right, right, cross with the left, spin and turn!
hopeless i

again!
we know you don't want to bring pain and misery to your friends and neighbors. we'll pray to find you some honest work.
and we know that, even though most people would call you a leech and a parasite, the lowest slug of humanity! we know that deep down inside, you're probably even worse.  and so you truly need our prayers.
yes, prayer is the answer, and prayers free  we're going to give free prayers to everyone who drives up to this house.
we're nuns!
are you going to shoot us all, tough guy?
is it worth it?  a lot of witnesses here.
eddie!  you scared the hell out of me!
what if i was vince?  you'd be dead right now.  what are you doing giving interviews on tv?
it wasn't my fault!  they just showed up.  it's helping the convent.
you're supposed to be hiding out!
i really can't talk about it now.  the place is packed.  sro.  i've got a show to do.
listen to yourself.  this isn't a career opportunity.
i know that.  this isn't about me.  it's about the choir.  you should hear them. they're good.  really good.  and i taught them.
jesus, look at you   you're glowing.
i am?
yeah.  you look... great.  i mean it..
really?  lieutenant?
i've been worried about you.
you mean -- worried about my testimony?
no -- worried about you.  personally.
well..  thanks.  i've been thinking about you.. - sometimes.  i mean, there aren't a lot of guys around here.  i mean, sometimes i feel like... a nun.
me too.
you're not... seeing anybody?
no.  most of the time i'm thinking about you.  and now... you've really changed.
i have?
you re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  you're rea1ly different...
i've got to go.
just remember - you're a target.  don't you think vince has a t.v.?
i know, i know.  i'll be careful.  i'll try.
hey, girls.
hail, mary.
jerusalem is a real drag.  everybody hates me.
oh-huh.
people throw stones.  they call me names.  i mean, really.
really.
but -- wait.
what is it, mary?
that man -- who is he?
he's not like other guys.
he's decent.
he's kind.
he's... dreamy.  he's...
yes, mary?
he's so fine...
jackpot!  two buckets
this is so exhilarating!  all week long, i can't wait till sunday, when we sing.
i'd rather sing than do anything!
it's better than ice cream.
it's better than springtime.
and on such an occasion, i feel a completely traditional program will be best.
what do you mean?
the council of cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire catholic church.  they command the utmost respect. your more... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place.
but, reverend mother -- everyone loves our new style.
it's brought people back to the church.
isn't that why we were asked to sing for those cardinals?
i believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
a vote?
of course.  mary clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state.  most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole.  a membership that, i am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. all those in favor of allowing mary clarence to select a program?
but... wait a minute...
the majority has spoken.
she's a pro.
what?
you sent for me?
you have a phone call.
hey -- your prayers have been answered. i'm leaving.  in just a couple of days.
really.  well, that makes two of us.
what?
i have submitted my resignation to bishop o'hara.  privately.  i have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
but -- why?
i must go where i can be of use.
but -- there's so much more to do right here.  and look, if it's about me, i mean, i'm gone.
indeed.  after how long?  a few weeks? i have been here thirty years.  and yet, it would seem, i know nothing.
but everything that's happening is good! you can be a part of it!
a part of what?  mary clarence, it is one thing to rabble rouse, to sweep into town and declare a holiday.  you have raised the sisters' expectations, you have excited and confused them.  they imagine this neighborhood to be some sort of delightful ongoing block party.
you and i know that life is not so simple.  there will be disappointments. rude shocks.  and you will have vanished. how... fortunate.
okay, so i just got things started.  but you could build on that.  you could keep it going.
i am sorry, mary clarence.  i seem to have misplaced my tambourine.  good day, mary clarence.
but...
good day.
ice cream!
mary clarence -- you shouldn't have. where did you get this?
it's contraband.  don't ask.  but i wanted to give you a treat.  a sort of... thank-you gift.
a thank-you?  for what?  you're the one we should be thanking.
is there any syrup?
well... see, at my old convent, i wasn't always... real popular.  i was sort of selfish and... not real helpful.  okay, i'll say it -- i wasn't much of a nun. but now, thanks to all of you... maybe i'm shaping up.
mary clarence, don't be silly.  you're an example to us all.  you've taught us so much.  we're singing for the cardinals, and then -- who knows?  maybe the choir can travel -- to schools, and nursing homes.
maybe we can get some of the local kids to sing with us.
we could cut a demo.  look for a label.
that's true, wouldn't that be great.  of course, we never know when things are going to change.  any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
are you leaving us?
oh no.  we'll always be together.
the council of cardinals!  i'm so nervous!  what if i forget the words?
right to hell.  just kidding. where is that bus?
it should be here any minute.
dress rehearsal at four, performance at 8:30.  sharp.
hurry, sister!
get moving.  i'm right behind you.
vince knows you're here.
how?
long story.  his goons will be here any minute.  we've got to get you out of here '- now!
i can't go with you.
what?
i've got a show -- at st. matthew's cathedral.  we're singing for the cardinals.
you're gonna be singing for st. peter if you don't get your ass out of here!
mary clarence!  sister!
it's no use.  she just isn't here.
we can't sing without her!  what should we do?
we'll pray -- and she'll be there.
eddie -- i've got to go back.  they won't sing without me.  i'm deserting them.
i think they'd understand.
that's not the point!  they need me!
they need you?  a bunch of nuns?  for what?  moral guidance?  make-up tips?
you don't get it!  it's a big thing for them, it's like... caesar's palace. prime-time.  they're singing for the cardinals.  it's like... "star search." if first prize was a trip to the vatican. they've worked really hard, they deserve this.
nuns?
so that guy in the bar was right?  she's like... some kind of nun?
yeah, right -- when i see it.
what're you doing?
even nuns have to pee.
we sound terrible   we need mary clarence.
we're losing it.
i don't understand.  where is she?
her whereabouts are unknown, and we must proceed without her.  pull yourselves together.
wait, this isn't the way.  who are you?
they're from my old convent.
run!  take off!
again?
but what do they want?  where are we going?
she's got nothing to do with this.  let her go.
yeah, right to the cops.  no way.
mary robert, don't panic.  remember what we talked about?  experience?
what?
you can handle this.
she's gettin' away!
forget her!  we got the one we need! step on it!
you mean -- they kidnapped her?
yes -- two men -- and they had guns.
she shouldn't have come back.  she knew she was in danger.
but -- why would anyone kidnap a nun?
an... entertainer?
she wasn't a nun?
look what she did with the choir.  she made us sing beautifully.
that should have tipped us.
well, i don't care who she is.  we can't sing without her!
she's our inspiration!
we've got to save her!
we can't leave it up to the feds!
calm down.  think clearly.  mary robert, do you have any idea who those men were?
she said they were from her old convent.
but... she was a showgirl.  she didn't have an old convent.
she told us about one.  the little sisters of the moonlight.  in las vegas.
all right.  it's a beginning.  las vegas, nevada.
peace on earth.
however, we can also pray for other things.
measles.
babe, what happened here?  look at you.
good evening, vincent.
what, vincent?  this is me, doll.  i know you.  what did you think you were doing?  running to the cops.  hiding out. no, no.  you're sorry now, aren't you?
i am sorry for all my sins.  and yours.
she's a nun, vince.
i love you, chris.  i always will.  i gave you so much.  my time.  my affection.  a big-time career.  and how do you repay me?  what's the thanks i get?  where's the loyalty, huh?  where's the love?
and who are you to talk?  you were nothing.  you couldn't even sing.  i must have been out of my mind.
she's acting weird, vince.  ever since we picked her up.
she's afraid.  come on, tell the boys you're afraid.
i feel sorry for you, vincent.  and i forgive you.
it's so beautiful...
and what a lovely name.  las vegas...
it's done?
not... totally.
what's the problem?
she's... she's a nun.
are you nuts?  she's not a nun.  it's christy.  she's a babe!
but, vince, how do you know she didn't like, join up and become a nun when she was in that convent?
it didn't happen.
she was real quiet and peaceful all the way back in the car.
no smart-ass remarks or nothing.
i can't believe this.  okay, i want both you guys to go back there, and both of you shoot her at the same time.
yeah...
you didn't shoot!
neither did you!
i figured if you were gonna, then i wouldn't have to.
that's what i figured, too.
las vegas -- she's here somewhere.
but where?
the little sisters of the moonlight!
but how do we get there?
well?
it didn't work, vince.
you were both supposed to put your guns to her head and shoot.
we both missed.
okay, so the problem is still the nun outfit, right?
right.
so, take it off.
strip down a nun?  you want us to fry?
for like, twelve zillion eternities?
i'm telling you, she's not a nun!  get her out of the nun outfit, and put her in some clothes.
maybe pants.
a sweater.
and then we can ice her.  no nun, no evil eye.
okay, christy -- strip.
what?
that... thing.  that nun thing.  take it off.
what's she doing?
she's praying.
excuse me -- has anyone seen a nun?
a benedictine.
what are you doing here?
saving you.  move!
get her!
which one!
there she is!
which one?
i can't see anything in here!
willy -- hit the lights.
where?
find 'em!
joey?
where is she?
right here.  let the others go -- they have nothing to do with this.
joey -- do it.
but, boss -- she's still, you know, a nun.
she's a broad!  got it!  just some broad!
mary clarence -- you're alive!
christy.
van cartier.
you know?  about me?  about everything?
reverend mother -- thank-you.
oh?
you saved my life.
i'm a christian.
don't you have a concert to go to?
that depends.  sisters, you don't know this, but reverend mother's been making all sorts of noises about resigning. that's bad news.  i don't know if we could sing, if we thought that was true.
not a note.
impossible.
then i guess you're stuck.  life sentence.  no parole.
very well.  i hold you responsible for all of this, for introducing a lounge act into my convent.  for utterly disrupting our way of life.  and for placing all of us in mortal danger.  thank-you.
yeah, eddie, thanks a whole bunch. thanks for sticking me in a convent.  so you think, after all this, maybe i really am a nun?
i don't know.  there's only one way to be absolutely sure.
yeah, like what?
i was good to you! you re nothing but no-talent garbage! you're a two-bit tramp!
that used to be true, vince.  i was with you.  but something happened.  and i'm different now.  real--different.  i've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  and i've got just two words for you.  and those two words are...
mary clarence!
bless you.
hey -- you re supposed to be the cheerful one.  why do i suddenly feel like snow white?
you re okay -- for a civilian.
reverend mother?
yes?
since mary clarence came to st. katherine's, i've been shot at, kidnapped by mafia hit men, and i've tasted beer. is that enough experience yet?  for final vows?
i don't think so.  what about skydiving? a crank call to billy graham?
you have evidenced great maturity, mary robert.  we shall have a serious discussion.
what about me, reverend mother?  i think you were right.  i'm just a bad influence.  sister show biz.
perhaps not.  perhaps we can all use... a little spandex.
really?  and maybe shorter habits, and women priests, and sleeping late?
don't push it.
i was downhearted
it's true!
i was hell-bound, yes that's what they say satan was waiting
don't you know it!
but the lord came to me
what did he say?
he said, sing the devil away!
my soul was in danger i'd fallen from grace
it's true -- i know her.
damnation was all i could see
what a shame!
but then came an angel who whispered these words
pay attention...
sing and the devil will flee!
were you wicked?
sing!
were you tempted?
sing! sing and your spirit will soar!
but i'm fearful!
sing!
and i'm tearful!
sing!
yes i'll sing and know joy evermore
just sing!
sing!
