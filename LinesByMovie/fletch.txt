so what do you figure?
no idea.
no idea at all?
okay. some idea.
like when?
like tonight.
for sure?
no, not for sure. when it comes, it comes. you gonna want some shit?
i think i’d rather have drugs.
fletch...
sorry. i find a little humor really brightens things up around here, don’t you?
hi sam. hi fletch.
hi gummy. how’s the eye?
it’s okay. the cops did it.
i know.
they busted me last week.
they bust you every week.
i know. i got bad luck or something.
maybe tonight?
whaddyamean 'maybe'?
that's what he said.
he doesn't know? how come he doesn't know?
i don't know how he doesn't know. he doesn't know.
sonofabitch.
wonder who his supplier is.
i have no idea.
i wasn't asking.
he never leaves the beach, fat sam. never leaves. sits in that chair, he's outta junk. then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. so where does it come from? through the sand?
i think that's highly unlikely, creasy.
i ought to get some sleep.
creasy, how old are you?
nineteen.
you're not taking real good care of yourself.
excuse me. i have something i'd like to discuss with you.
what?
we can't talk about it here.
why not?
because we can't.
are you on a scavenger hunt of some kind?
i want you to come to my house. then we'll talk.
i think you've got the wrong gal, fella.
i'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. if you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
will this proposition entail my dressing up as tina turner?
it is nothing of a sexual nature i assure you.  one thousand, just to listen. i don't see how you could turn that down mr...
nugent. ted nugent.
alan stanwyk.
charmed.
then i found out hopalong cassidy had shot himself in the game room. that just blew it for me.
who?
hopalong cassidy. killed himself here. bow and arrow. strange.
i don't work for you yet, assface. don't talk to me like that.
come inside.
here's my proposition, mr. nugent.
i'm all ears.
i want you to murder me.
you don't look sick, mr. stanwyk.
i don't feel sick. not yet. they tell me it'll start getting bad in about a month. after that... well, i'd rather not be around for it.
why don't you try suicide?
my company has taken out a very large insurance policy on me. and i have a wife. suicide would nullify my insurance. murder does not.
so why pick me?
you're a drifter, a -- pardon the expression -- beach bum. no one would notice if you disappeared. i've watched you for a couple weeks.
maybe i'm just on vacation.
not with the scum you hang out with. i've watched. i've thought. its a perfect scheme. i even have a perfect escape plan for you.
did it ever occur to you that i might not want to kill you?
i've got fifty thousand dollars says you will.
i'm still here.
i want it done thursday evening, around eight pm. my wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. it's the staff's night off.  these will be open.
wouldn't they normally be locked?
sometimes yes, sometimes no. the staff usually forgets.
i have the same problem with my help.
i will be here in the room, waiting for you. the safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. you will be wearing rubber gloves. do you own rubber gloves?
i rent them. monthly lease, with an option to buy.
in this drawer....
a .357.
very good. my .357. use it and no one can trace it to you. the room will be in some disarray.
so it looks like a burglary attempt. you catch me. i get the gun, and shoot you.
precisely. are you a good shot?
what's the difference? the noise'll kill you first.
get me on the first shot, if you can.
i don't think you'll have to worry about that.
do you have a passport?
sure, all drifters do.
fine. after you kill me, take the jaguar. the keys will be in the glove compartment.
take it where?
lax. go to the pan am desk. there will be a ticket waiting for you.
where am i going?
rio. flight 306. departs at eleven pm.
they serve dinner on the flight?
it'll be a first class-ticket. i'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. i would recommend staying down there at least a year, mr. nugent.
you've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
i am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, mr. nugent.
you sure those doors will be open?
yes. all you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. i'll take care of everything else.
the gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
that's right.
you sure got the hard part.
what do you say, mr. nugent? you'll be doing me and my family a great service.
will you kill me?
sure.
yo!
can i steal you for a minute?
only if you promise not to return me.
deal.
'magic' today, huh?
kareem's in the wash. i need a favor.
shoot.
don't say shoot, okay.
did you hear something?
not me.
me neither. see what we've got on a guy named alan stanwyk, okay? i need it right away.
w-y-k no 'c.' i'll be down in a minute.
no problem, boss.
fletch.
frank, you look a little peaked. wanna vomit?
no, i want an answer, is the story done?
uh, almost.
'uh, almost' is not an answer. 'yes frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
and a damn fine one, i might add.
two...
irwin...
oh, i hate it when he calls me that.
irwin, professional journalism time, now. go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
i will, frank, i will. something came up, okay?
no it's not okay. you have to have this in by tomorrow. did you see the ad we ran sunday?
i never read the paper.
...never reads the paper...
what's the spread on the game tonight?
i don't know.  look!
looks great.
now, irwin, try to follow me. you can't run the ad and then not run the story.
why not? oh shit... really?
just kidding, frank. you'll have the story and you'll be damn proud of it.
you broke it? you know the source?
practically.
what's 'practically'? is it fat sam? you said you had pictures of him....
i have pictures of him. dealing...
so let's go! we run the pictures.
he's not the story! there's a source behind him.
who?
well, there we're in a gray area.
how gray?
i'd say charcoal.
i'm going to bite out your eyeballs, you know that?
frank, you animal, i love it. i'll have the story by thursday night, i swear to god.  i hope.
'mr. stanwyk, of provo, utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
married boyd aviation. he's no dummy, that's serious coin.
'stanwyk's parents, marvin and velma stanwyk, also of provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
not our kind of people, you understand.
spot right here.
thanks.
you doing a story on this guy?
maybe.
'...stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist doctor joseph dolen.'
i wonder if that's his doctor.
only one way to find out.
so where do you know alan from?
we play tennis at the club.
really. the california racquet club?
yes.
that's my club too. i haven't seen you there.
well, i haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
right, and how long have you had these pains, mr. barber?
that's babar.
two bs?
one. b-a-b-a-r.
that's two.
but not right next to each other. i thought that's what you meant.
arnold babar. isn't there a children's book about an elephant named babar?
i don't know. i don't have any.
no children?
no books. no elephants either. no really good elephant books.
still, it'd an odd name. i don't remember seeing it on the club registry.
oh, i don't belong formally. i've gone with my aunt.
your aunt?
mrs. smith.
joan or margaret smith.
right.
well, which one?
margaret.
funny old bird.
is she ever. i've got some stories....
i'll bet. shame about ed.
it was. really a shame. to go so suddenly.
oh, he was dying for years.
sure, but the end was so sudden.
he was in intensive care for eight weeks.
yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden.  you know, alan and i were recently speaking of dying. told me boyd aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. you must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
bend over and drop your pants, mr. babar.
oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
just relax....
honest, i feel fine. you better be married.
did i say 'kidneys'? i meant my ear. maybe i should see an ear dahhh --  ever serve time?
breathe easy...
anyway, i'm surprised alan got the policy so easily. i know there's a history of cancer in the family.
there is?
whoa, look out there. you really need the whole fist?
just relax.
gee, alan's been looking kind of sick lately. is he all right?
i can't discuss another patient. you know that.  well, i can't find anything wrong with you.
i'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. maybe i should get a real complete physical. you give alan an annual, don't you?
yeah, we check you into mt. hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. you can pull your pants up now.
i hope they still fit. do i get to keep the glove?
tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. she'll make all the arrangements.
thanks, doc. maybe i'll come back with a date. or an elephant.
it's me doctor rosenpenis. i just have to take another peek at alan stanwyk's file. what have they done with this place?
nothing. they're still there.
right. fine.
are you all right, doctor?
where am i?
you're in the records room.
i'm fine.
can i get you something?
have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? heh heh, just kidding.
doctor holmes went to get you some smelling salts. he was quite surprised that you fainted.
well, i didn't want to say anything, but i thought the dead man was my brother.
oh my god!
it's all right. it wasn't him but that spleen was a splitting image.
oh, god, i think i'm about to hyperventilate. have you got a paper bag, or something.
yes, right away.
here you are, doctor.
thank you.
is there anything particular you're looking for?
my associates did a biopsy on this man recently.  he's supposed to have a melanoma, or a carcinoma, some kind of noma. hmmm. i can't seem to find any record of it.
well, if he had one, it would certainly be in here.  wait. here it is. yep. surgical removal of two moles. tissue was benign.
that's it?
that's it.
this was last month. so alan stanwyk does not have cancer.
i guess not.
he'll be so relieved.
refusal to pay alimony is a jailable offense, fletch.
what about breaking and entering?  are you wearing anything under that?
i did not break nor enter. i simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
i hate to conduct business on the lanai. why don't we step inside.
you owe wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
she doesn't need the money, for crissakes. she's living with monty. i know it.
i don't know what you're referring to. wendy maintains her own residence.
it stinks. i thought woman were independent now.
until she remarries, fletch.
hey, shut up, okay? i just hate this.
i empathize with your plight, fletch. however, you threw her out.
she was sleeping with everybody. the cable tv guy. you can't get lower than that...
you should have proved that in a court of law.
my lawyer was a bum.
i agree.
i think he was sleeping with wendy, too.
you may be right.
are you serious?
that's history, fletch. you owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
wait a minute! our problems might be solved.
damn... lost again. sorry.
this is no joke. if some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
cash. i'm impressed.
found it in a cab. that's a grand. apply the difference to next month.
till then.
i haven't seen you since the wedding, jeez, you look great.
i do? oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. i have to confess something to you. i must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. i really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
huh? no, not my wedding. yours.
oh, mine! thank god.  actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? are you a friend of alan's?
we used to fly together. i'm... john.
john! you used to fly together!
john who?
john ultrarelamensky.
oh, i'm sorry. it's a beautiful name, really.
it's scotch-rumanian.
that's a strange combination.
so were my parents.
mind if i keep practicing? i need to work on my ground stroke a little.
please.
excuse me sir. are you a guest of the club?
yes, i'm with the underhills.
they just left, sir.
they'll be back. he had to go in for a urinalysis.
would you care for a drink while you're waiting? i can put it on the underhill bill.
great. i'll have a bloody mary and a steak sandwich.
very good sir.
damn, i thought i had that one.
you should play with much larger tennis balls. so how's alan?
what are you asking me for? he's so busy lately i hardly see him. and he's been so preoccupied.
preoccupied with what?
oh, personal stuff. look! i hit one!
why do you keep doing this?
i love the outfits.
stay!  i must be having an off day. i'm really a fabulous player.
i have this effect on lots of women.
i bet you do.
say, the reason i asked about alan is that i bumped into him this morning and you know what i can't figure out?
alan's in utah.
i can't figure out why i went to utah for the morning.
okay. i'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so i'm very flattered, but i'm also very married so you may as well forget -- you are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
i'm such a heel. how'd you guess?
if i had a nickel for every one of alan's flyboy buddies who tried to pick me up, i'd be a rich woman.
you are a rich woman.
see what i mean?
what's he doing in utah?
none of your business, now go away. you're throwing my game off.
first of all, let me just reiterate that this is not a formal investigation. i'm not going through formal channels here, because if alan stanwyk is not involved in any improprieties, then nobody has to know i was even --
alan stanwyk is not involved in improprieties. where the hell does the s.e.c. come off --
look. you know that and i know that, but somebody's bucking for a promotion. i think it's that bozo, hanrahan, i can't be sure. anyway, unless i go back there with something, you and your son-in-law are next week's scapegoats.
unbelievable.
i feel like dirt. they even want to know what he's doing in utah?
utah?  jesus christ! first of all, alan stanwyk does not own one share of stock.the three million dollars for the ranch in provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. now if anybody in dc wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. until then, get the hell out of my face.
god i admire you.
by the way: what kind of name is poon?
comanche indian.
oh, margie, sorry, frieda lost the number of alan's realtor in provo. can you give it to me real quick?
jim swarthout?
yeah.
and, i'm sorry, who are you again?
frieda's boss.
who's frieda?
my secretary.
hey, what are you doing?
fletch, this is dumb.
you don't have to run with me, crease.
fletch!
what goddamn right do you have to take him?
hey you're really nuts.
they didn't do anything.
what? what are you talking about?
i busted their window, they didn't do anything.
you're lucky.
not luck. they don't want me.
gummy and two cops...
cool your tool, frank, i need a little more time. i think i'm really on to something here.
you're onto something. that's good. what?
i really don't want to spoil your surprise, frank. why don't you read it tomorrow?
nothing on gail stanwyk, nothing on jim swarthout. but i did ---
that's okay, lar. i gotta put this on the back burner for a while.
just give me a hint, all right?
all right. maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this.
did you say cops?
yeah.
that's one thing i did find. it's from last month, so it was in the unsorted pile.
more cops.  i think i gotta go to utah, frank.
utah?
yeah. it's wedged in between wyoming and nevada. i'm sure you've seen pictures.
what about finding the source?
i have some ideas.
who? donnie and marie?
very possibly. come on, say yes. i'll buy you a shirt.
go to transportation, get a ticket.
my hero.
nothing to it.
you decorate this yourself or did mrs. chief of police help you?
you should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. mauve.  so what's your name?
fletch.
full name.
fletch f. fletch
i see. and what do you do for a living, mr. fletch?
i'm president of the international fletch corporation.
why are you doing this mr. fletch?
frankly sir, you look a little like my father. probably explains the curious feeling of love i have for you.
for a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin...
it was planted on me, sir.
we're looking at five years, maybe ten. is that what you want... jane doe?
your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. fletch starts to get up, but cummings plants his foot on fletch's chest, forces him back down.
i'm about to break that beach wide open, and i don't need some pennyante woodward and bernstein getting in the way of my men.
'your men' might just be involved in all this.
you idiot. off the record, deep background: i've got that beach crawling with undercover cops.
you go back to that goddamn beach, i swear to god i'll make you regret it.
hey, you and tommy lasorda. that's great.
you can't keep me here.
maybe i'm not going to keep you here.  maybe i'm gonna blow your brains out.
i'm no lawyer, but i do believe that's a violation of my rights.
after i shoot you, i stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. self-defense. we don't do this very much anymore... but we have. got rid of a lot of minorities that way.
my god, you're serious.
ask anybody.
can i ask anybody now?
can i call my mom? i'd like to tell here how much i've always loved her.
what'll it be fletch?
i hate the beach. wouldn't go there if you paid me. besides, i'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the himalayas. you don't think it's the mafia, do you?
its been very nice meeting you. i enjoy your column.
speaking of which, you're not going to print anything before my investigation is through, are you?
not a prayer.
that a boy.
thanks for coming down to see us.
not at all, chief. but next time... no tongue, okay?
how could you call him?
it's called journalism, fletch. it's called getting both sides of the story. something you apparently don't know anything about.
it's also called getting me this close to being murdered.
get out of here.
he threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if i didn't promise to give up the story.
you know, i've had it up to here with your bullshit. i need a story from you by tomorrow.
you'll have it.
but not unsubstantiated charges about dope-dealing cops, and not horse shit paranoid fantasies about homicidal police chiefs.
thanks for the vote of confidence, frank.
i want something i can print!
print this frank.
hi, where's mrs. stanwyk?
in her cabana, sir.
oh, that's right. she told me to meet her there. that's cabana six?
cabana one.
one.
would you be caring for something to eat or drink, sir?
i would, actually.
charged to the underhills, sir?
right. tell you what -- have you caviar?
yes, sir. beluga. but it is eighty dollars the portion.
i'd better only get two. how about the lobster thermidor?
i recommend it.
fine. and a couple of bottles of dom perignon. to cabana one.
very good, sir.
who is it?
it's john. john...  znhcneelsky.
john ultramalensky?
hi.
hi.
i was hoping you'd say that.
uh... i'm just out of the shower.
can i borrow your towel for a minute?
i'm sorry, i'm just surprised to see you. i didn't think... what do you want?
i ordered lunch.
you ordered it here?
well, i knew this is where my mouth would be.
down boy.
i really should change.
no, i think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today.
i mean put clothes on.
here, take mine.
have you gotten cuter since i last saw you?
yes.
lunch...
god...
you want i set up?
no thanks, i'll do it. give yourself twenty dollars. underhill.
muchas gracias.
sierra del fuego.
all this goes on underhill's bill?
i saved his life during the war.
you were in the war?
no. he was. i got him out.
'i've been so many places in my life and times. i've sung a lot of songs, i've made some bad rhymes...'
it's amazing.
'i've acted out my life on stages, with ten thousand people watching...'
your bone structure, shoulders, neck...
'but we're alone now, and i'm singing this song for you.'
just like alan. it's freaky.
can i ask you a question?
depends on the question.
are you still in love with alan?
no.  i mean, 'no you can't ask me that.' i mean, ask me something else.
why'd you let me in?
because i'm bored. oh, that sounds terrible, doesn't it. i'm sorry. if it makes you feel any better, i also let you in because i'm hungry.
thanks, i feel much better. listen, if you're so bored, why didn't you go to utah with alan?
utah is not exactly a cure for boredom.
good point.
oh, listen to me. i've never even been there and look what i say about it. anyway, i know there'd be nothing for me to do. i don't even know anybody there.
what about his parents?
he never sees them and i never met them.
how come?
yes?
mrs. stanwyk, i hate to disturb you. tom underhill here... i'm a new member.
thanks for the great time.
what is this?
long story.
apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill.
john!
you don't know the underhills?
i'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you.
i just stepped out of the shower! can you give me a minute?
of course.
i'll be leaving now, mrs. stanwyk.
i think you should call me gail, now.
gail. i hope this won't embarrass you in any way. i think underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him.
why did you do it?
a four hundred dollar lunch tab!
yeah.
i'll cover it. you have any other surprises?
yeah. my name's not john ultramalensky and i wasn't at your wedding.
who.
irwin fletcher. i write a newspaper column under the name jane doe.
so?
so, your husband hired me to kill him. that's the truth.
what are you talking about?
that's what i want to know.
mrs. stanwyk!
in a minute!
he told me he was dying of cancer. not true. that ranch you thought you were paying for in utah? not true.
how do you know about that?
he's a bad guy, mrs. stanwyk. gail. i think he's involved in something very big and very bad.
what does all this mean?
have you ever heard the name jim swarthout?
swarthout. yes. he's the man who sold us the ranch in --
wrong. he sold you $3,000 worth of scrub brush.
but i've seen the deed.
you saw a forgery.
here's this dog that tried to eat me. here's my motel. here's the car i rented...
stop it.  are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
i don't know. all i know is that he told me a lot of things and so far not one of them has been true.
no. you can't. look, i know you don't know me from adam, but you've got to trust me.
trust you? i may seem a little goofy at times, but i'm not a complete bozo, you know.
just give me twenty-four hours. please. someone almost killed me today. people are not being nice lately, and i don't want you getting hurt. i think you're terrific. are you a laker fan?
no... i've got to go to mr. underhill...
i'll take you to a game.
what are you talking about?
i'm talking about how much i'd like to take you to a laker game.
wait a second. what am i supposed to do for twenty-four hours?
act natural.
i was afraid you'd say that.
if you need me, call the paper. hand me that extra bottle okay?
yes sir, you are confirmed on flight 306 to rio tomorrow evening at 11 pm. first class.
you're kidding.
would you like me to change anything?
so he's going. uh... are there any other tickets charged to the same account?
we'd have no way of knowing that, sir.
hmm. it's just that there are some other people from my office going on this trip and... is there anyone in the seat next to me?
never heard of him. thanks anyway.
you mean her.
what?
sally ann cavanaugh. oh wait, she couldn't work in your office, she's not from around here.
oh, thanks.
the door was unlocked.
lock's busted.
no wonder.
i work for the landlord. he told me to watch out for the place.
i commend him on his choice.
what?
i commend him on his choice
i was supposed to meet mrs. cavanaugh.
who are you?
don corleone. i'm a cousin of mrs. cavanaugh's.
where is she?
moved out.
she moved out?
i spoke to her last week. she didn't say anything.
she moved out.
so you're saying she moved out.
this morning.
this morning? christ. we had so much to talk about. moe green is out of the tropicana, and my sons, michael and fredo, are taking over.
what did you want under the bed?
mattress police. there are no tags on the mattress. i'm going to have to take you downtown. please give me your weapon.
i'm calling the cops. this is for the cops.
i'm her cousin.
tell the cops.
go ahead. call them. better tie your shoelaces first.
i'm harry s. truman from casewell insurance underwriters.
harry s. truman?
my parents were great fans of the former president.
isn't that nice. good man. showed the japs a thing or two.
sure did. dropped the big one on them.
dropped two big ones. real fighter. you're in the insurance line, harry?
right.
well, i'm fully covered.
i don't doubt it, mr. stanwyk. actually, my company is the sub- insurer of the subsidiary carriers of a policy held by alan stanwyk, who i believe is your son.
yes. where you from, harry?
california. san berdoo. utah's part of my route. can i ask you a few questions?
come on in.
regulations, mr. stanwyk. and you and your wife, named....
velma.
velma. you and velma are the parents of alan stanwyk, beverly hills, california, executive vice president of boyd aviation?
check.
okay.  now, the last time you saw your son was when?
oh, about ten days ago.
ten days ago?
that's right. alan comes by every three weeks or so.
isn't that nice. since when?
since he moved to l.a.
forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in provo.
what the hell does this have to do with insurance?
trust me, sir. it's a comprehensive policy.
well, you can forget about that lady friend business, alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. he dotes on that bride of his.
cute young thing, too.
i'm sorry?
his bride. cute as a button.
you've met her?
has he?
boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
then he has.
course he has. that's his wife.
of course, his wife's name is sally ann cavanaugh?
cute thing.
do you happen to have a picture of alan and his wife?
oh, we've got lots of pictures. let me show you some.
he sighs.
and they're still married... alan and sally ann.
of course they are.
she's cute as a button.
how long have they been married?
lets see, it was before he moved to l.a... four years april.
mrs. stanwyk, may i borrow this picture. i promise to send it back to you. it's routine, really. the actuarial people need to --
oh, that's all right, i've got lots more. want to see the reception?
no, thank you.
how about marvin's sixty-fifth birthday party?
i overheard it. he thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. if i were you, i'd just chuck it, fletch. screw him. let him eat three full pages on sunday.
you kidding? i got an unbelievable story here, lar. un-believable. jesus. it's the cops, i know it. the chief! and they're all over frank.
i just thought... sure.  sally ann cavanaugh.
check every hotel in l.a. start with the ones near the airport. yeah. he's about to leave the country with her. thanks, lar.
what's wrong, gail?
i decided i was going to tell my husband about you today.
no.
but first i called the hall of records in provo. they checked on the deed. you're telling the truth. a minute later alan came in the room and asked me why i was shaking.
i've never lied to him before.  it's the first time he's ever lied to me. he was just as convincing as when he says 'i love you.'
i think you better sit down.
oh god, i hate things that start like that....
gail, please.
what is this....
i checked. there was no divorce.
are you telling me my husband is a bigamist???
i'm telling you he's not your husband at all.
and they're leaving the country tomorrow night.
bastard.
i don't have all the pieces yet, but i'm close. i'll know tomorrow.
i'm calling the police. right now.
you can't do that.
don't tell me i can't --
they're trying to kill me!
i'm terrified.
come here.
i'm the sufi.
fletch?
don't call me fletch. don't look at me. lie back down. we'll talk.
what?
cops are here. i can smell them. they're after me. lie down, gum.
why are they after you?
because i'm a newspaper reporter and i'm nailing chief cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. you're in big trouble, gummy.
fat sam is turning state's evidence.
what's that?
he wrote me a nice deposition. he says he just received the drugs. you did the selling.
i didn't sell nothing! i didn't sell nothing! i just carried the drugs from the chief to sam.
sure you did.
fletch, i never sold nothing.
twenty years.
where does the chief get the drugs?
i dunno. somewhere in south america, i forget.
rio de janeiro, maybe?
maybe, fletch. is that brazil?
that's brazil.
yeah. maybe.
wait here for me, gummy.
jesus.
you don't know me.
my pleasure.
i'm serious, sam.
what, the heat here?
affirmative.
the two surfer boys?
affirmative.
thought so. what for?
for me. i'm a reporter, sam. i'm breaking the drug story and i got the chief red-handed. gummy gave me a deposition.
you gonna nail the chief?
i'm gonna nail the chief. and you can help or --
oh, i'll help, fletch. i'm a slave to that sonofabitch. he busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: work for him or do fifteen long. all i get out of this is free snort.
you don't have a piece of the action?
noooo. free snort. that's it.
wait five minutes, and go to my office. you'll get federal protection after that.
gonna need it. that boy is dangerous. fletch?
what?
you find the source?
gum thought brazil.
rio. know how he gets it in the country? some big shot airline executive flies it in on company jets. very impressive operation, fletch. very impressive.
i'm quitting, frank. as of midnight tonight.
what?  who the hell are they?
this is fat sam, and this is gummy.
what...
their statements, naming chief cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to oxnard. i want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship.
i'm out, frank. you lost faith in me.
fletch, i got nervous. please....
forget it.
fletch, you want an apology?
you were going to can me, right?
not really.
not really?
i was upset.
i'm sick of this place. i'm going to try out for the lakers. they need a power forward.
fletch.
good evening.
i like your outfit. you got the fifty grand and the plane ticket?
of course.
why don't you check it out for yourself, mr. nugent?
because i trust you, alan. by the way, the name's fletcher. i.m. fletcher. i write a newspaper column under the name jane doe.
what?
read this, please.
wait a second --
cut the crap and read it.
he is lifting stanwyk's two attaché cases.
pretty hefty. keep reading.
'...with his legal wife, the former sally ann cavanaugh.'
don't worry, i can take it.
you shouldn't be here.
i want to hear this.
he doesn't read my stuff well.  'sally ann and alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making stanwyk a bigamist even in utah. stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of gail stanwyk's conversion of boyd aviation stock. mrs. stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor james swarthout of provo.'  that was stupid, alan.
i'd have been long gone.
ahem.  'sally ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the airport marriott.'
bravo, mr. fletcher.
the thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together.
and what was that?
how similar in build you and i are. then i figured it. you bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.
i was already prepared to commit one murder. what makes you think i won't commit two?
whoops.
greetings, everyone.
thank god, the police.
what the hell are you doing here?
put the gun down, alan. i'll take care of them.
i thought you had this all figured out. good going 'irwin.'
don't ever call me 'irwin,' okay?
i've got it all under control, jerry. you can go now.
under control? you idiot. you didn't know who he was?
fat sam left the beach today. so did gummy. it began to occur to me that some things are beginning to happen that maybe i should be aware of.
i said i'll take care of it. now, a man of your position shouldn't be a part of what's about to go down. so go home and i'll call you tomorrow.
what, 'long distance?' i couldn't help but hear you say something about rio, alan. you're not leaving with the eight hundred thousand dollars i staked you for the next load, are you?
jerry, you're simply going to have to trust me. i've got a foolproof way to get rid of this guy and now you're jeopardizing everything.
your 'foolproof' way is going to land my ass on the front page while you're basking in rio.
this one's going to be even more fun.
go ahead. make my evening.
i'm calling the police. then i'm leaving. you wait here for them.
where are you going?
away. i think it might take you a while to get your life back together. you don't need me around.  don't go back in there.
i really creamed the sonofabitch, didn't i?
you sure did.
your call is come through.
far out.  larry? it's fletch.  well, it's not 'fat sam's', but... any port in a storm.  oh, tell frank i need a couple of months. the fifty grand's lasting longer than i thought.
john ultramalensky, right?
right.
god, i haven't seen you since the wedding.
gee, i must have been shit-faced at your wedding, i don't --
not mine, stupid. yours.
what are you doing here?
i couldn't sit home and play the mournful widow anymore, and the police didn't need me, so i tried watching a lakers game on tv, but the announcer talked to fast and i couldn't understand a lot of what was happening, so i figured if i came down here maybe you could explain the rules to me, and besides, i missed you.
no problem.
