you're late again, rick.
i know, sister, but i have a very good excuse.
there can be no excuse for tardiness.
you're absolutely right. i should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. i'm just weak, sister; i'm so weak.
sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? if you do, why don't you give me a call. i'm in the book.
get going, rick... you're late enough as it is.
right... think it over.
how are we doing? my name is o'neill. and you are...?
klupner.  mrs. klupner.
mrs.?
i'm separated.
then there is a god. why don't we take that baby picture.
i'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. could you undo a few buttons?
of course.
where'd she go?
she probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. o'neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... i have major news to announce.
hey, you guys, what's going on?
we're going for a little liquid refreshment.
great. i'll go with you. wait a second. hey, raul! move that car, will you?
i'm glad you guys came by... what's the occasion?
rick's got an important announcement to make.
yeah. what is it?
i've decided not to run for president.
too bad, man, that blows my chance to be ambassador to france.
screw you... screw that... don't jerk me around. you promised me 1500 seats for the police concert... 1500, not fifteen!... screw that... screw you -- screw sting.  hi, guys.
gary, you're quite an animal.
screw you...
let's go.
isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
okay... we're all here. rick, what's the big announcement?
all right, gentlemen, i'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. i've known you guys since grade school, so i'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
man, you're losing your audience.
okay... this is it... i'm getting married.
what?
you're kidding.
yes, gentlemen. saturday after next, i lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
hey, man, congratulations!
wait a minute. you been living with debbie! why do you want to get married?
because i love her. what can i tell you?
yeah, man. let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
yeah. right. all the things that make life worth living.
sounds swell... i'm really touched. and my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. we're still gonna go bowling on tuesdays, play cards on fridays and wear women's clothes on sunday night. i love you guys... i always will.
let's have a toast.
debbie... i don't believe it. i'm so excited.
bobbie, what are you talking about?
o'neill just tole me. it's sooo great... i don't believe it.
what's happening?
debbie's marrying rick.
...really?
does cole know about this?
really -- you went with him for two years.
he still thinks i'm going with him. i'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
he's not gonna be happy. and your parents can't be too thrilled either.
no. as far as they're concerned the only good rick is a dead rick. but i don't care... it's my decision.
i'm totally blown away. you're getting married. it seems like only yesterday i showed you how to have oral sex.
deb, i want to throw you a shower.
god, you're a slob.
but a fabulous cook.
what are we having?
it's either meatloaf, swiss steak or charred flesh. i won't know till it's finished.
i think your dinner's burning.
don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
want to hear something great? bobbie and phoebe are throwing me a shower. it's really gonna be fun.
not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
you're going to have a bachelor party?
of course. i'm a traditional guy... it's a traditional event.  well, what do you think?
it looks awful.
yes, but looks are deceiving...  not in this case, however.
are you going to have women at your party?
no, sweetheart, it's a stag party. does stay home.
i'm not talking about does. i'm talking about hookers.
oh, those. why do you ask?
because from what i've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
cole?
over here, deb... in the smokehouse.
cole, we've got to talk.
finally realized rick's a jerk, huh?
no, cole, i...
it's all right, i forgive you. i'm not the vengeful type. we'll forget what happened. why don't we take a trip together? maybe kill a few lions in kenya over christmas.
cole, listen to me... i've got to tell you...
you know, when you dumped me for that wimp, i thought, cole, she'll be back. god wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
cole, i'm marrying rick.
you're marrying him? then why are you coming back to me?
i'm not. i just thought i should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
you know how that makes me feel, deb? wanta know how that makes me feel?  angry, deb.  yesss, that's the word, angry. but if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. i want you to be happy, deb.  no matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. be happy, deb. be oh, so very, very happy.
cole, i'm sorry, i...
that's all right, deb. go be happy and smile a lot, deb. do it for me.
i'm going now, cole.
i understand, deb. 'bye... be happy.
you always were sneaky, stan, very sneaky.
rick, marriage will be good for you. it's done wonders for me.
true, you're a lot handsomer now. don't you have enough blood already?
you won't miss a thing about being single... the wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... god, i miss that.
stan, you're depressing me... hey, i didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. just take a couple of gallons, okay?
that's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
okay, rick, all finished. i can't wait for that bachelor party... i need the action.
oops!
all right, who serves?
rick, hit the ball easier, son. you don't have to kill it.
can't i just maim it a little?
er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
no. let's at least finish the set.
well, i have to admit my game's a little rusty, but i love polo. it's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. really a beautiful experience.
rick, i want to cut through the b.s.
i'd love that.
good. i think you're an asshole. no, let me correct that, an immature asshole. which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and i'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
mr. thomerson, i...
let me finish. debbie's an adult. she can do what she wants. but if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. if i may make some suggestions...
feel free.
first, you're a slob. you have to dress for success. second, your outlook on life...
i'm using the same caterer for the shower i had for our christmas party last year.
great, mom.
if i were you, i'd worry less about the shower and more about rick's bachelor party.
ilene, why would i want to do that? i trust rick.
of course you do. i trusted my ex, mel, too. cousin, i can only talk from experience. what do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
ilene, rick promised...
debbie, don't be naive. men are pigs.
girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
in a second...  and you're irresponsible. show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
hi, everybody. am i late?
not at all. we're just finishing lunch.
and...
bond... james bond.
so, cole, you been practicing your game?
sure have...
why is cole here?
you know your father enjoys his company.
nice shot.
thank you, sir.
i know you're as unhappy as i am about debbie's marriage to rick.
yes, sir, i am.
cole, i don't want you to give up on her.
i've tried to change her mind.
it's not her mind you need to change. it's disneyland head in there.
but how can i do that?
if it were me, i'd reason with him first. then, if that failed...  ...i'd take more persuasive action.
thanks for the advise, sir.
keep me informed.
the thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
you can tell a man by his friends.
cole. don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
i want debbie.
cole...
you dump her and i'll give you cash.
what's debbie's blue book value right now?
five thousand dollars.
no.
seventy-five hundred.
not interested.
okay, ten thousand plus a g.e. toaster oven, a litton microwave, a cuisinart...
i'm marrying debbie.
michelin tires... brand new. a set of sears best metric tools...
what is this person's story here?
thanks, dad.  cole, go away.
he's gonna hurt you, debbie. he'll never be true to you the way i would.
thank you. we'll all keep that in mind. 'bye now.
huh? wha...
i can't sleep.
oh... i got something for that.
stop fooling around... i need to talk.
what's the matter?
i don't know... i just feel scared.
about what?
the wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
i think the only think you've left out are our relations with the soviet union. sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
before or after i have my nervous breakfown?
c'mere.
that feels so great.
good...
um... that's very relaxing.
now, i want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
you sure gary's got this whole party deal together?
yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
i hope so. hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
what time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
where the hell is he?
knowing larry, he probably missed the flight.
so, larry, how have you been?
just in love with everybody. it's really a beautiful planet. i love you, rick. i love you guys. i love everybody.
i hate her. i hate her guts, the bitch.
larry, you and your wife got problems?
i don't want to talk about it. i love you guys. i love my friends.
you want to share it?
naw, two on a quaalude... bad luck.
right.
my marriage is the worst. all crap. a big pile of shit.
maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
she hates me. it's over. you'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. you sure you want to go through with it, man?
what do you mean, it changes?
well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
you better not have too much joy.
wouldn't think of it. because tomorrow...  we're going to the chapel and we're...
gonna get married...
this is it, lady. last stop.
can't i just go with you guys?
sorry, we got men's business to do. it's no place for a lady.
remember, you promised... no screwing around.
did i promise that? i don't remember that...
you're really pissing me off.
okay, i promise... i swear on my mother's grave.
your mother's not dead.
well, if i go back on my word, i'll kill her.
have a good time. don't make it too late.
anything you say, ma'am. have a fun shower. use soap.
i love you.
what's the matter?
nothing... let's get crazy!
all right!
when do the girls get to the party?
so we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
let's see your bread.
park view hotel, room 1002.
they'll be up there in a half hour.
okay. nice to meet you both.
are any of those right?
this is the park view hotel. i'm the hotel manager. are you looking for someone?
yes, you. we're looking for our room... 1002.
it's on the tenth floor.
what do you know, they moved it. catch you later.
keep your voices down. this is a respectable establishment. we don't go for any funny business here. just then a guy with a moosehead beer hat and two guys in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
i see what you mean... you're a beautiful guy. and you're doing a damn good job.
what do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
they'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. but don't worry about the dirty movies.
what do you mean?
i forgot to tell you. yesterday i found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of o'neill's car.
you're kidding.
nah. everything's cool... i took care of 'em.
where's the women, man? we gotta have women.
chulo, one thing at a time.
sex is my one thing. i'm good at it.
we'll spend an hour with "nymphos without pants"...
olivier's in that, right?
then it's on to the real thing.
denmark makes great nautilus equipment.
i'd like to jerk and press those babies.
excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the vatican.
this isn't right.
i don't get it, but at least gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
women!
give the guy air. everyone to a neutral corner.
what's going on?
it's true.
this place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
guy paints a beautiful picture.
i'm going to see what the hell happened.
looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
screw that.
rick, i want to talk to you.
ah, cole.  i don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
i don't want any trouble.
oh, come on, just a little.
i'm ready to make you another deal.
ooh, be still, my heart.
see that down there? that's my most prized possession. my new porsche.
great car.
the best.
i love that car.
i'm very happy for you two.
i'll trade you my porsche for debbie. an even swap.
the car for debbie?
i mean it. the car is yours. dump debbie.
gee, guys, what should i do? the car or debbie?
low mileage... handles like a dream.
so does debbie.
shit, shit, shit, shit. my car's gone!
maybe it had something to do.
shit!
jumbo, where the hell are the women?
what are you talking about, asshole?
your whores never showed up.
they left an hour ago, pink nuts.
screw you!
that's it, prick lips.
what are you...
i've had it, numb nuts... how much money you got?
why?
because i'm pissed off. now give me your cash.
this is bad public relations. i was planning to do a lot of business with you. but now i'm going to have to go elsewhere.
hey. i'm sorry. you want girls. i'll give you girls.
give him the works.
that's more like it.
are you sure this is a good idea?
look, you heard what those hookers said. they were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
that doesn't mean it was rick's party.
debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
look at that guy. what a hunk.
check out the other guy's buns.
hookers beat you up?
yes.
i didn't know you were into that.
guys, i think i'd rather stay here.
c'mon, larry. be good for you.
i just want to be alone.
all right. now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. go to bed right after "falcon crest."
ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
my pleasure, al... always happy to help out in a pinch...  excuse me. i better call my service... tell them where i am.
congratulations on your daughter's wedding. who's she marrying?
a real turd.
well... hope she'll be very happy.
what can i be doing for you?
you're a pimp?
i'm telling you i am, joe.
i want women.
that i got. very good women. they sit on your face, anything you want.
i'll take some.
big problem now. soon they go to customers.
i need them for a bachelor party at the park view hotel.
you are being in luck. customers in same hotel. i let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
sold. 45 minutes. no problem.
not one minute longer or milt will come for you.
milt?
lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
no, she hates me... i want to end everything here... now.
you okay?
yeah, i guess so.
really?
yeah. i see you're right. c'mon, let's party.
hello?
mr. thomerson.
yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
yes i did.
fine. how's everything going?
not so good. he wouldn't listen to reason. he stole my car... my porsche... i can't find it anywhere...
so, he's playing hard ball. well, two can play that game.  go after him. stop at nothing. you hear me?
what? i'm sorry, sir, i can't hear you.
some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
well, tell the asshole to shut up.
right.  hey, shut up. okay, sir.
sorry, i can't hear you. some pin head's yelling...  shut up, i'm talking here.  now look, i want you to go back and i don't care what you do. stop that marriage.
rick... debbie is mine. she'll always be.
cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
you've had it. i'm gonna get you.
don't you love it when old friends stop by?
hey, i'm starved... let's go get something to eat. we'll bring back food for everybody.
i'm not really hungry.
c'mon. i insist.
what the hell is that?
my gift to you.
under the table!
the best table in the house.
i think you'll enjoy this table.
so long, father.
i don't get it. why didn't you go for it just now?
i don't know. maybe it's because i love debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. i'm not sure.
nah, that's okay. my brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. let's give him a break.
right. give me the will to live. let me go first.
great bathing suit.
i think i screwed that one once.
a strange wang right in my palm.
ilene, we don't really know that.
that's what we're going to find out...
i feel like i'm spying on rick.
thanks a lot, that was the best. you're next.
nah, not yet. look, you're my older brother. i need some advice here. what's the deal with marriage? what can i expect?
well, the first month it's great. the second month things calm down a little. by the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
thanks, stan, you've been a lot of help.
what the hell are you doing?
i'm trying to slash my wrists.
you're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
i couldn't find any razor blades.
well, this is terrific. now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. just go out there. forget about everything and laugh it up.
ha, ha, ha.
no, have fun first. then laugh. now, forget about marriage for a while. go party.
gary, how we doing, big stallion?
rick, i really think i'm in love.
this is cause for celebration. she'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
rick, i'm concerned.
about what?
this is your bachelor party. you haven't had sex with anyone yet.
get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
i got something you can't resist. i have a friend, tracey. she wants to meet you. she loves to please.
oooooo.
right in there, pal.
if i'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
that's the old rick!
how'd it go?
put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
i'm proud of you, lad.
who was that?
i don't know.
what's this?
got me.
how 'bout this?
still drawing a blank.
he look familiar?
very.
c'mon. get the hookers in a circle. we better put cochise out of business.
what kind of job? i'm a housewife.
quiet, mother.
now, don't get into any trouble.
take care.
how the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
i don't know.
what? i thought you told me you had it all figured out.
maybe i did... i don't remember.
i'd love to get you in an operating room. just once.
can you believe how perfect it fits?
yeah. who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
hey, you guys...
who's your friend?
oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. we're bringing them to the party.
great.  i was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
thanks for helping us out, ed. we appreciate it.
any time, al.
cole, my god, boy, what are you doing here? what happened?
the bachelor party's upstairs. they made me get naked. they hung me from the window so high up it was so scary i fell down...
take hold of yourself. what room are they in?
1002.
all right, i'll go up there and take care of this myself.  you look awful, son. go find yourself some clothes.
yes, sir.
hi, guys. we brought back a friend.
it's bullwinkle.
how about this, a trojan donkey.
and here's mike's partner, in more ways than one. a gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. the very lovely, miss desiree...
it's my fault. he's dead because... i left those drugs...
it's really not all your fault. i was talking to mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. personal things, you know. made some bad investments. at least now he's peaceful...
welcome, welcome, one and all.
rick!
oh, no!
what are you going to do about it?
what can i do? i'm dead. debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
i'll stop him... you stall him.
is that all the coke in the place?
that's it.
good.
the end.
no sob story is going to change my mind.
reach out and snort someone.
i'm saved. let's party!
deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
right in here. the big show starts in one minute.
let's go.
look, girls -- i'll stay behind and hold them off. the rest of you break for it!
ilene, are you crazy?
i know what i'm doing... go!
i hope ilene's all right.
i hope those guys are all right.
guess who's here? another surprise guest.
who?
debbie.
my debbie?
what's with her costume?
i don't know... go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
you got it.
don't turn on the lights, sugar.  i'll lead you around.
how wonderful. a seeing eye hooker.
why don't you get undressed.
i can't trust you!
c'mon, i knew it was you.
rick, you're lying!
let go of me!
debbie, i'm telling you, i didn't do anything, hardly.
the marriage is off. now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
i don't want that. i want to be with you.
and i want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
i am committed. i love you.
i don't believe you.
you don't believe me? okay, fine.
see? and these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- i didn't want any of them. you... you're what i want. understand?
yes...
great. now, what do you want to do about it?
let's get naked.
you're on.
ebbie. ger... umph... lable...
of course, sir. that explains it. leather is a very good source of vitamin e.
you're all under arrest. open up!
your attention, please. may i be the first to say, it's a raid!
ed... you're kinky!
the phone made me do it!
you've been having strange sex...!
no, brett, i...
it's all right...  so have i.
cole, what the hell are you doing?
she's mine!
he and debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. fourteen movie theaters under one roof. prominent is a sign which reads: "24 hour 3d festival!" cole drags debbie into one of the theaters. the gang runs up to the theaters.
fan out and look for them.
are you okay?
yeah.
this has been quite a night. here's a thought. why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
you're so romantic...
you're late again, rick.
i know, sister, but i have a very good excuse.
there can be no excuse for tardiness.
you're absolutely right. i should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. i'm just weak, sister; i'm so weak.
sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? if you do, why don't you give me a call. i'm in the book.
get going, rick... you're late enough as it is.
right... think it over.
how are we doing? my name is o'neill. and you are...?
klupner.  mrs. klupner.
mrs.?
i'm separated.
then there is a god. why don't we take that baby picture.
i'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. could you undo a few buttons?
of course.
where'd she go?
she probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. o'neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... i have major news to announce.
hey, you guys, what's going on?
we're going for a little liquid refreshment.
great. i'll go with you. wait a second. hey, raul! move that car, will you?
i'm glad you guys came by... what's the occasion?
rick's got an important announcement to make.
yeah. what is it?
i've decided not to run for president.
too bad, man, that blows my chance to be ambassador to france.
screw you... screw that... don't jerk me around. you promised me 1500 seats for the police concert... 1500, not fifteen!... screw that... screw you -- screw sting.  hi, guys.
gary, you're quite an animal.
screw you...
let's go.
isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
okay... we're all here. rick, what's the big announcement?
all right, gentlemen, i'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. i've known you guys since grade school, so i'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
man, you're losing your audience.
okay... this is it... i'm getting married.
what?
you're kidding.
yes, gentlemen. saturday after next, i lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
hey, man, congratulations!
wait a minute. you been living with debbie! why do you want to get married?
because i love her. what can i tell you?
yeah, man. let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
yeah. right. all the things that make life worth living.
sounds swell... i'm really touched. and my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. we're still gonna go bowling on tuesdays, play cards on fridays and wear women's clothes on sunday night. i love you guys... i always will.
let's have a toast.
debbie... i don't believe it. i'm so excited.
bobbie, what are you talking about?
o'neill just tole me. it's sooo great... i don't believe it.
what's happening?
debbie's marrying rick.
...really?
does cole know about this?
really -- you went with him for two years.
he still thinks i'm going with him. i'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
he's not gonna be happy. and your parents can't be too thrilled either.
no. as far as they're concerned the only good rick is a dead rick. but i don't care... it's my decision.
i'm totally blown away. you're getting married. it seems like only yesterday i showed you how to have oral sex.
deb, i want to throw you a shower.
god, you're a slob.
but a fabulous cook.
what are we having?
it's either meatloaf, swiss steak or charred flesh. i won't know till it's finished.
i think your dinner's burning.
don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
want to hear something great? bobbie and phoebe are throwing me a shower. it's really gonna be fun.
not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
you're going to have a bachelor party?
of course. i'm a traditional guy... it's a traditional event.  well, what do you think?
it looks awful.
yes, but looks are deceiving...  not in this case, however.
are you going to have women at your party?
no, sweetheart, it's a stag party. does stay home.
i'm not talking about does. i'm talking about hookers.
oh, those. why do you ask?
because from what i've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
cole?
over here, deb... in the smokehouse.
cole, we've got to talk.
finally realized rick's a jerk, huh?
no, cole, i...
it's all right, i forgive you. i'm not the vengeful type. we'll forget what happened. why don't we take a trip together? maybe kill a few lions in kenya over christmas.
cole, listen to me... i've got to tell you...
you know, when you dumped me for that wimp, i thought, cole, she'll be back. god wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
cole, i'm marrying rick.
you're marrying him? then why are you coming back to me?
i'm not. i just thought i should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
you know how that makes me feel, deb? wanta know how that makes me feel?  angry, deb.  yesss, that's the word, angry. but if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. i want you to be happy, deb.  no matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. be happy, deb. be oh, so very, very happy.
cole, i'm sorry, i...
that's all right, deb. go be happy and smile a lot, deb. do it for me.
i'm going now, cole.
i understand, deb. 'bye... be happy.
you always were sneaky, stan, very sneaky.
rick, marriage will be good for you. it's done wonders for me.
true, you're a lot handsomer now. don't you have enough blood already?
you won't miss a thing about being single... the wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... god, i miss that.
stan, you're depressing me... hey, i didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. just take a couple of gallons, okay?
that's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
okay, rick, all finished. i can't wait for that bachelor party... i need the action.
oops!
all right, who serves?
rick, hit the ball easier, son. you don't have to kill it.
can't i just maim it a little?
er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
no. let's at least finish the set.
well, i have to admit my game's a little rusty, but i love polo. it's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. really a beautiful experience.
rick, i want to cut through the b.s.
i'd love that.
good. i think you're an asshole. no, let me correct that, an immature asshole. which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and i'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
mr. thomerson, i...
let me finish. debbie's an adult. she can do what she wants. but if you want your marriage to last, you're going to have to change some things about yourself. if i may make some suggestions...
feel free.
first, you're a slob. you have to dress for success. second, your outlook on life...
i'm using the same caterer for the shower i had for our christmas party last year.
great, mom.
if i were you, i'd worry less about the shower and more about rick's bachelor party.
ilene, why would i want to do that? i trust rick.
of course you do. i trusted my ex, mel, too. cousin, i can only talk from experience. what do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
ilene, rick promised...
debbie, don't be naive. men are pigs.
girls, why don't we go inside for lunch.  boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
in a second...  and you're irresponsible. show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
hi, everybody. am i late?
not at all. we're just finishing lunch.
and...
bond... james bond.
so, cole, you been practicing your game?
sure have...
why is cole here?
you know your father enjoys his company.
nice shot.
thank you, sir.
i know you're as unhappy as i am about debbie's marriage to rick.
yes, sir, i am.
cole, i don't want you to give up on her.
i've tried to change her mind.
it's not her mind you need to change. it's disneyland head in there.
but how can i do that?
if it were me, i'd reason with him first. then, if that failed...  ...i'd take more persuasive action.
thanks for the advise, sir.
keep me informed.
the thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
you can tell a man by his friends.
cole. don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
i want debbie.
cole...
you dump her and i'll give you cash.
what's debbie's blue book value right now?
five thousand dollars.
no.
seventy-five hundred.
not interested.
okay, ten thousand plus a g.e. toaster oven, a litton microwave, a cuisinart...
i'm marrying debbie.
michelin tires... brand new. a set of sears best metric tools...
what is this person's story here?
thanks, dad.  cole, go away.
he's gonna hurt you, debbie. he'll never be true to you the way i would.
thank you. we'll all keep that in mind. 'bye now.
huh? wha...
i can't sleep.
oh... i got something for that.
stop fooling around... i need to talk.
what's the matter?
i don't know... i just feel scared.
about what?
the wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
i think the only think you've left out are our relations with the soviet union. sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
before or after i have my nervous breakfown?
c'mere.
that feels so great.
good...
um... that's very relaxing.
now, i want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
you sure gary's got this whole party deal together?
yeah, man, he's got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
i hope so. hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
what time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
where the hell is he?
knowing larry, he probably missed the flight.
so, larry, how have you been?
just in love with everybody. it's really a beautiful planet. i love you, rick. i love you guys. i love everybody.
i hate her. i hate her guts, the bitch.
larry, you and your wife got problems?
i don't want to talk about it. i love you guys. i love my friends.
you want to share it?
naw, two on a quaalude... bad luck.
right.
my marriage is the worst. all crap. a big pile of shit.
maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
she hates me. it's over. you'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. you sure you want to go through with it, man?
what do you mean, it changes?
well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
you better not have too much joy.
wouldn't think of it. because tomorrow...  we're going to the chapel and we're...
gonna get married...
this is it, lady. last stop.
can't i just go with you guys?
sorry, we got men's business to do. it's no place for a lady.
remember, you promised... no screwing around.
did i promise that? i don't remember that...
you're really pissing me off.
okay, i promise... i swear on my mother's grave.
your mother's not dead.
well, if i go back on my word, i'll kill her.
have a good time. don't make it too late.
anything you say, ma'am. have a fun shower. use soap.
i love you.
what's the matter?
nothing... let's get crazy!
all right!
when do the girls get to the party?
so we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
let's see your bread.
park view hotel, room 1002.
they'll be up there in a half hour.
okay. nice to meet you both.
are any of those right?
this is the park view hotel. i'm the hotel manager. are you looking for someone?
yes, you. we're looking for our room... 1002.
it's on the tenth floor.
what do you know, they moved it. catch you later.
keep your voices down. this is a respectable establishment. we don't go for any funny business here. just then a guy with a moosehead beer hat and two guys in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
i see what you mean... you're a beautiful guy. and you're doing a damn good job.
what do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
they'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. but don't worry about the dirty movies.
what do you mean?
i forgot to tell you. yesterday i found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of o'neill's car.
you're kidding.
nah. everything's cool... i took care of 'em.
where's the women, man? we gotta have women.
chulo, one thing at a time.
sex is my one thing. i'm good at it.
we'll spend an hour with "nymphos without pants"...
olivier's in that, right?
then it's on to the real thing.
denmark makes great nautilus equipment.
i'd like to jerk and press those babies.
excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the vatican.
this isn't right.
i don't get it, but at least gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
women!
give the guy air. everyone to a neutral corner.
what's going on?
it's true.
this place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
guy paints a beautiful picture.
i'm going to see what the hell happened.
looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
screw that.
rick, i want to talk to you.
ah, cole.  i don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
i don't want any trouble.
oh, come on, just a little.
i'm ready to make you another deal.
ooh, be still, my heart.
see that down there? that's my most prized possession. my new porsche.
great car.
the best.
i love that car.
i'm very happy for you two.
i'll trade you my porsche for debbie. an even swap.
the car for debbie?
i mean it. the car is yours. dump debbie.
gee, guys, what should i do? the car or debbie?
low mileage... handles like a dream.
so does debbie.
shit, shit, shit, shit. my car's gone!
maybe it had something to do.
shit!
jumbo, where the hell are the women?
what are you talking about, asshole?
your whores never showed up.
they left an hour ago, pink nuts.
screw you!
that's it, prick lips.
what are you...
i've had it, numb nuts... how much money you got?
why?
because i'm pissed off. now give me your cash.
this is bad public relations. i was planning to do a lot of business with you. but now i'm going to have to go elsewhere.
hey. i'm sorry. you want girls. i'll give you girls.
give him the works.
that's more like it.
are you sure this is a good idea?
look, you heard what those hookers said. they were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
that doesn't mean it was rick's party.
debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
look at that guy. what a hunk.
check out the other guy's buns.
hookers beat you up?
yes.
i didn't know you were into that.
guys, i think i'd rather stay here.
c'mon, larry. be good for you.
i just want to be alone.
all right. now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. go to bed right after "falcon crest."
ed, we're so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
my pleasure, al... always happy to help out in a pinch...  excuse me. i better call my service... tell them where i am.
congratulations on your daughter's wedding. who's she marrying?
a real turd.
well... hope she'll be very happy.
what can i be doing for you?
you're a pimp?
i'm telling you i am, joe.
i want women.
that i got. very good women. they sit on your face, anything you want.
i'll take some.
big problem now. soon they go to customers.
i need them for a bachelor party at the park view hotel.
you are being in luck. customers in same hotel. i let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
sold. 45 minutes. no problem.
not one minute longer or milt will come for you.
milt?
lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
no, she hates me... i want to end everything here... now.
you okay?
yeah, i guess so.
really?
yeah. i see you're right. c'mon, let's party.
hello?
mr. thomerson.
yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
yes i did.
fine. how's everything going?
not so good. he wouldn't listen to reason. he stole my car... my porsche... i can't find it anywhere...
so, he's playing hard ball. well, two can play that game.  go after him. stop at nothing. you hear me?
what? i'm sorry, sir, i can't hear you.
some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
well, tell the asshole to shut up.
right.  hey, shut up. okay, sir.
sorry, i can't hear you. some pin head's yelling...  shut up, i'm talking here.  now look, i want you to go back and i don't care what you do. stop that marriage.
rick... debbie is mine. she'll always be.
cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
you've had it. i'm gonna get you.
don't you love it when old friends stop by?
hey, i'm starved... let's go get something to eat. we'll bring back food for everybody.
i'm not really hungry.
c'mon. i insist.
what the hell is that?
my gift to you.
under the table!
the best table in the house.
i think you'll enjoy this table.
so long, father.
i don't get it. why didn't you go for it just now?
i don't know. maybe it's because i love debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. i'm not sure.
nah, that's okay. my brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. let's give him a break.
right. give me the will to live. let me go first.
great bathing suit.
i think i screwed that one once.
a strange wang right in my palm.
ilene, we don't really know that.
that's what we're going to find out...
i feel like i'm spying on rick.
thanks a lot, that was the best. you're next.
nah, not yet. look, you're my older brother. i need some advice here. what's the deal with marriage? what can i expect?
well, the first month it's great. the second month things calm down a little. by the third month you're looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you're numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
thanks, stan, you've been a lot of help.
what the hell are you doing?
i'm trying to slash my wrists.
you're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
i couldn't find any razor blades.
well, this is terrific. now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. just go out there. forget about everything and laugh it up.
ha, ha, ha.
no, have fun first. then laugh. now, forget about marriage for a while. go party.
gary, how we doing, big stallion?
rick, i really think i'm in love.
this is cause for celebration. she'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
rick, i'm concerned.
about what?
this is your bachelor party. you haven't had sex with anyone yet.
get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
i got something you can't resist. i have a friend, tracey. she wants to meet you. she loves to please.
oooooo.
right in there, pal.
if i'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
that's the old rick!
how'd it go?
put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
i'm proud of you, lad.
who was that?
i don't know.
what's this?
got me.
how 'bout this?
still drawing a blank.
he look familiar?
very.
c'mon. get the hookers in a circle. we better put cochise out of business.
what kind of job? i'm a housewife.
quiet, mother.
now, don't get into any trouble.
take care.
how the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
i don't know.
what? i thought you told me you had it all figured out.
maybe i did... i don't remember.
i'd love to get you in an operating room. just once.
can you believe how perfect it fits?
yeah. who'd have thought they'd both be a size 138 regular.
hey, you guys...
who's your friend?
oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. we're bringing them to the party.
great.  i was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
thanks for helping us out, ed. we appreciate it.
any time, al.
cole, my god, boy, what are you doing here? what happened?
the bachelor party's upstairs. they made me get naked. they hung me from the window so high up it was so scary i fell down...
take hold of yourself. what room are they in?
1002.
all right, i'll go up there and take care of this myself.  you look awful, son. go find yourself some clothes.
yes, sir.
hi, guys. we brought back a friend.
it's bullwinkle.
how about this, a trojan donkey.
and here's mike's partner, in more ways than one. a gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. the very lovely, miss desiree...
it's my fault. he's dead because... i left those drugs...
it's really not all your fault. i was talking to mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. personal things, you know. made some bad investments. at least now he's peaceful...
welcome, welcome, one and all.
rick!
oh, no!
what are you going to do about it?
what can i do? i'm dead. debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
i'll stop him... you stall him.
is that all the coke in the place?
that's it.
good.
the end.
no sob story is going to change my mind.
reach out and snort someone.
i'm saved. let's party!
deb, we're pretending to be hookers.
right in here. the big show starts in one minute.
let's go.
look, girls -- i'll stay behind and hold them off. the rest of you break for it!
ilene, are you crazy?
i know what i'm doing... go!
i hope ilene's all right.
i hope those guys are all right.
guess who's here? another surprise guest.
who?
debbie.
my debbie?
what's with her costume?
i don't know... go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
you got it.
don't turn on the lights, sugar.  i'll lead you around.
how wonderful. a seeing eye hooker.
why don't you get undressed.
i can't trust you!
c'mon, i knew it was you.
rick, you're lying!
let go of me!
debbie, i'm telling you, i didn't do anything, hardly.
the marriage is off. now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
i don't want that. i want to be with you.
and i want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
i am committed. i love you.
i don't believe you.
you don't believe me? okay, fine.
see? and these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- i didn't want any of them. you... you're what i want. understand?
yes...
great. now, what do you want to do about it?
let's get naked.
you're on.
ebbie. ger... umph... lable...
of course, sir. that explains it. leather is a very good source of vitamin e.
you're all under arrest. open up!
your attention, please. may i be the first to say, it's a raid!
ed... you're kinky!
the phone made me do it!
you've been having strange sex...!
no, brett, i...
it's all right...  so have i.
cole, what the hell are you doing?
she's mine!
he and debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. fourteen movie theaters under one roof. prominent is a sign which reads: "24 hour 3d festival!" cole drags debbie into one of the theaters. the gang runs up to the theaters.
fan out and look for them.
are you okay?
yeah.
this has been quite a night. here's a thought. why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
you're so romantic...
