eh ... pardon me for asking but who is that little old man?
what little old man?
that little old man.
oh, that one. that is me grandfather.
that is not your grandfather.
it is, y'know.
but your grandfather lives in your house. I have seen him.
oh, that is me other grandfather, but this one's me grandfather and all.
how d'you reckon that one out?
well ... everyone's entitled to two, are not they, and this is me other one.
well we know that but what is he doing here?
well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
how is that?
oh ... he is nursing a broken heart.
you see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.
a butcher?
yeah, she was fickle.
aye and fond of fresh meat and all.
no ... it was his sweetbreads. she was dead kinky for sweetbreads. anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
oh, i see.
eh, he is a nice old man, is not he?
oh yeah, he is very clean, y'know.
hello, grandfather!
hello.
he can talk then?
course he can talk. he is a human being, like. is not he?
well ... if he is your grandfather, who knows?
and we are looking after him, are we?
I will look after meself.
aye, that is what I am afraid of!
he is got you worried, then?
him, he costs you a fortune in breach of promise cases. he is a villain and a right mixer as well.
gerron.
no, straight up.
morning!  who is that little old man?
it is paul's grandfather.
oh aye, but i thought ...
no, that is his other one.
that is all right then.
clean though, is not he?
oh yes, he is clean all right.
are you listening to me, lennon?
you are a swine, is not he george?
he belongs to paul.
ah well, there you go. look, I am going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?
well, look after him. i do not want to find you have lost him.
do not be cheeky, I will bind him to me with promises. come on, grandad.
gie's a kiss!
shurrup! look, mister, we have paid for our seats too, you know.
yeah, you want to watch it.
it is not my fault.
well, you stick to that story, son.
i can not help it, I am just taller than you.
I am sorry norm, but i can not help being taller than you.
well, you do not have to rub me nose in it. I have a good mind to ...
if you are going to have a barney I will hold your coats.
he started it.
no, i did not you did ...
well, what happened?
the old fella wanted these pictures and norm said he could not have 'em, all i said was 'aw go on, be big about it.'
and?
your grandfather pointed out shake was always being taller than me just to spite me.
i knew it, he started it, i should have known.
y'what?
you two have never had a quarrel in your life and in two minutes flat he is got you at it. he is a king mixer. adam and eve, meet the serpent. anthony and cleopatra, there is your asp. divide and conquer, that is this one's motto. he hates group unity so he gets everyone at it.
aye and we will have to watch it and all.
i suggest you just give him the photos and have done with it.
come on let's get this coffee.
before you go, i think it is only fair to warn you about me grandson ... do not let our paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he will not respect you!
oh, paul, you can not have your own way!!!
if i let you have your own way, you little rascal, will you respect me?
give 'em a pull.
shall i?
aye, but do not rush. none of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.
now what is that supposed to mean?
i do not really know, but it sounded distinguished, like, did not it?
he is been gone a long time.
who?
paul's grandfather.
oh, i did not notice, where did he go?
down the ... er ...
oh, down the ... er ...?
yeah, down the ... er ...
well, give a couple of minutes ...
of course, john.
yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of liverpool. scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. orphans, every paddy's son of 'em. i saw their potential at once although i had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that ringo, but it was him what gave in first. he picked up a brick and heaved it at me and i quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. i was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler ... so, i took them under me managerial banner.
the usual ten per cent?
oh, not at all, i let them have twenty-five; sure are not there four of them?
how fascinating. do go on ...  ... john.
... oh, I am all heart, ma'am, all heart ... well, i let ...
eh, have you got paul's grandfather?
of course, he is concealed about me person.
no ... he is must have slipped off somewhere.
have you lost him?
do not exaggerate.
you have lost him.
put it this way, he is mislaid him.
you can not trust you with anything, norm, if you have lost him, I will cripple you.
he can not be far.
i hope he fell off.
do not be callous.
he does not like me, honest, i can tell ... it is 'cos I am little.
you have got an inferiority complex, you have.
yeah, i know, that is why i took up the drums. it is me active compensatory factor.
are you going in?
no, she will only reject me in the end and I will be frustrated.
you never know, you might be lucky this time.
no, i know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
we have broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all!  eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. i was framed. i was innocent.
will you stop it! sorry to disturb you, miss...
did you look in here?
no. i mean, it is probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
well, let's broaden our outlook.
oh no, you are not. you have gone too far this time ... and who is paying for all this?
it is all taken care of. it is down on our bill.
oh, well that is all right.  what?
come on, auntie, you are winning.
get in there, paul, she is weakening.
and to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!
do not dramatise.
all right, how about ringo? i mean ... he is very upset, you know ... and as far as your girlfriend, little audrey's concerned, she is finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing ...
a harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
oh, it is all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! honest, grandad, why? i mean, why do you do these things?
you are left-handed, are not you, paul?
yeah ... so what?
why do you always use your left hand?
well, do not be daft, I have got to.
and i take a left-handed view of life, I have got to.
do not worry, son, we will get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.
oh, it is a laugh a line with lennon.  anyroad up ... it is all your fault.
me? why?
bag-snatcher.
that is right; convict without trial ... habeas corpus.
every morning.
gaw, it is depressing in here, is not it? funny...  'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in england, do not they? you would expect something a little more palatial.  come on. let's have a little action. let's do something, then.
like what?
well, I have got me gob stopper.  look, a genuine stradivarius, hand tooled at dagenham.
do not move, any of you. they have gone potty out there. the whole place is surging with girls.
please, can i have one to surge with?
no.
ah, go on, you swine.
no, you can't. look, as soon as i tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that is waiting.
i do not snore.
you do - repeatedly.
do i snore?
you are a window rattler, son.
well, that is just your opinion. do i snore, paul?
with a trombone hooter like yours it would be unnatural if you didn't.
do not mock the afflicted, pauly.
oh for pete's sake, it is only a joke.
well, it may be a joke, but it is his nose. he can not help having a horrible great nose, it is the only one he is got. and his poor little head's trembling under the weight of it.
paul, john, george - get at it.
hello the income tax have caught up with us at last.
none for me, then?
sorry.
that will keep you busy.
it is your nose, y'see. fans are funny that way. take a dislike to things. they will pick on a nose...
is that yours?
for ringo.
that must have cost you a fortune in stamps, ringo.
he comes from a large family.
"the management of boyd's takes pleasure in requesting the company of mr. richard starkey, that is you, in their recently refinished gaming rooms. chemin de fer. baccarat, roulette, and champagne buffet." blimey!
and they want me?
oh, it is got round that you are a heavy punter.
well you are not going.
ah.
quite right, invites to gambling dens full of easy money and fast women, chicken sandwiches and cornets of caviar, disgusting!
that is mine.
have done, and you lot get your pens out.
I will brook no denial!
it is all right for you, you could not get a pen in your foot, you swine.
come on, shake, we will leave 'em to their penmanship.
what about all these letters?
read 'em!
lay them down.
eh?
lay them down.
we would be thrown out.
your cards... lay them down... face up.
they are yours.
they are?
the cards... you are bank.
now get on with it.
we were going to do it.
aye, well, now!
eh, what is all this?
oh, him... he is been lurking.
aye, he looks a right lurker.
you are undressed. where are your clothes?
oh, he is gone to my club, has he?
yeah, it is all your fault, getting invites to gambling clubs. he is probably in the middle of an orgy by now.
well, what are we waiting for?
aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
stay where you are everybody this is a raid and we want him.
who are these ruffians?... I have never seen them before in my life! ...
should i say it?
follow your impulse.
it will only get you into trouble.
aah, shurrup, misery!
would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
well, that is the wrong line for a start.
sorry?
yeah, you know, "o.k. buster, follow that car, there is a sawbuck in it for you if you get real close!"
oh, yes, now I am with you. [he changes his accent] but, gee, mister, I have got my license to think of ... we are doing a hundred now ...
ever seen one of these before?
ah ... a shamus, eh?
i see you go to the night court.
I have made the scene.
well, remember, its leathery magee up ahead in that convertible, so cover me in the stake-out.
i do not think that bit's right.
what do you expect from an ad lib ... raymond chandler?
will you all stop it, you are like a gang of school kids. i knew this was going to happen one day.
well, you should not have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
we are nearly there, sir.
eh ... do not call him sir, he is got enough delusions of power as it is.
anything to spare?
we have just finished, pauly. hey george, write us your john henry on this picture.
sure. .
ah well. eh, look!
let's go and muck in.
aye, before anyone stops us.
leave them drums alone.
oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
if you so much as breathe heavy on them, I am out on strike.
are not you being rather arbitrary?
that is right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. i do not go round messing about with your ear-phones, do i?
spoil sport!
well!
what is up?
he is sulking again.
all right, all right. if you do not need this lot, I will lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
please do, I will not need them for fifteen minutes. thank you.
let's have you.
come on speedy!
ringo!
wake up!
hello.
hello.
oh, wait a minute, do not tell me you are ...
no, not me.
oh you are, i know you are.
no, I am not.
you are.
I am not, no.
well, you look like him.
oh do i? you are the first one who ever said that.
oh you do, look.
my eyes are lighter.
oh yes.
and my nose...
well, yes your nose is. very.
is it?
i would have said so.
aye, but you know him well.
no i don't, he is only a casual acquaintance.
that is what you tell me.
what have you heard?
it is all over the place, everyone knows.
is it? is it really?
mind you, i stood up for you, i mean i would not have it.
i knew i could rely on you.
thanks.
oh they have probably gone to the canteen, cup of tea, like.
that is too easy for lennon.
he is out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
you are imagining it. you are letting things prey on your mind.
oh no... this is a battle of nerves between john and me.
but john has not got any.
what?
nerves.
i know, that is the trouble.
what are you doing there?
hiding.
i think you are soft or something.
well ...
when i tell you to stay put, stay put.
do not cane me, sir, i was led astray.
oh shurrup and come on john. they are waiting for you in the studio.
oh dear, i feel like doing a bit of work.
good lad, ringo.
oh, listen to teacher's pet.
you crawler.
he is betrayed the class.
oh, leave off!!!
temper! temper!
well ...
shurrup!
is not it always the way? picking on us little fellas.
shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
I am an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
I will set john on you!
oh, anything you say, paul.
sure.
and hurry, they are not looking too happy.
what is the matter with you? you were bashing away like a madman.
you were twanging too loud.
how did you like a dirty great drum roll giving you a clout right in the middle of your solo?
you are getting out of hand. i do not know what is come over you today.
that is right. it is always me, is not it?
since you ask, yes.  aah, come on, ring, we love you.
well!
he will get over it.
hello, he is not talking to me. he is having a sulk.
well, it must be catching. he is given it to the champ here.
stop picking on him.
i do not need you to defend me, y'know, norm.
leave him alone, he is got swine fever.
sit down, the lot of you.
what do you think are you are up to?
someone put it on me.
you will not interfere with the basic rugged concept of my personality, will you, girl?
eh, do not take out me lines.
behave...
foreign devil ...
leave him alone, lennon, or I will tell them all the truth about you.
you wouldn't!
i would though.
what is he know?
nothing, he is trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he is a swine but a clever swine, mind.
they are nearly ready for you. they are just finishing the band call.
gear! come on, girls, let's have a bit of a dance.
she is going to show me her stamp collection.
so's mine.
john, I am talking to you. this final run through is important. understand? important.
oink! oink!
I am adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
clever.  george.
look after him.
but...
do i have to raise me voice?
oh, all right. come here, grandad.
will you ever look at him, sitting there wid his hooter scraping away at that book!
well ... what is the matter with that?
have you no natural resources of your own? have they even robbed you of that?
you can learn from books.
can you now? aah ... sheeps' heads! you learn more by getting out there and living.
out where?
any old where ... but not our little richard ... oh no! when you are not thumping them pagan skins, you are tormenting your eyes wid that rubbish!
books are good!
parading's better!
parading?
that is it, parading the streets ... trailing your coat ... bowling along ... living!
well, i am living, are not i?
you are living, are you? when was the last time you gave a girl a pink-edged daisy? when did you last embarrass a sheila wid your cool appraising stare?
eh ... you are a bit old for that sort of chat, are not you?
at least I have a backlog of memories, but all you have got is that book!
aaah ... stop picking on me... you are as bad as the rest of them.
so you are a man after all.
what is that mean?
do you think i have not noticed ... do you think i was not aware of the drift? oh ... you poor unfortunate scuff, they have driven you into books by their cruel, unnatural treatment, exploiting your good nature.
oh ... i dunno.
and that lot's never happier than when they are jeering at you ... and where would they be without the steady support of your drum beat, I would like to know.
yeah ... that is right.
and what is it all come to in the end?
yeah ... what is in it for me?
a book!
yeah ... a bloomin' book!
when you could be out there betraying a rich american widow or sipping palm wine in tahiti before you are too old like me. a fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the friday queue at the post office.
yeah ... funny really, 'cos I would never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, does not it?
you are only right.
I am not wrong.
where are you off to?
I am going parading before it is too late!
eh, ringo, do you know what happened to me?
no. i don't.
eh. i thought you were looking after the old man.
get knotted!
we have got only half an hour till the final run-through. he can not walk out on us.
can not he? he is done it, son!
eh, i do not know if you realise it, but ...
we do.
yes. your grandfather's stirred him up.
he hasn't.
yes, he is filled his head with notions seemingly.
the old mixer, come on we will have to put him right.
it is happened at last, we have become a limited company.
I will look in here again.
here, mate, that is my hoop, stop playing with it.
hoop, this is not a hoop, it is a lethal weapon. have you got a licence for it?
oh do not be so stroppy!
well! a boy of your age bowling "hoop" at people. how old are you anyway?
nine.
bet you are only eight and a half.
eight and two thirds.
well, there you are and watch it with that hoop.
gerron out of it, you are only jealous 'cause you are old.
shurrup!
i bet you are  -- sixteen!
fifteen and two thirds, actually.
well --
all right, take your hoop and bowl.
oh you can have it, I am packing it in -- it depresses me.
y'what?
you heard, it gets on my wick.
well that is lovely talk, that is. and another thing, why are not you at school?
I am a deserter.
are you now?
yeah, I have blown school out.
just you?
no, ginger, eddy fallon and ding dong.
ding dong? oh ding dong bell, eh?
yeah, that is right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
yeah? and they are your mates are they?
yeah.
not much cop without 'em, is it?
oh, it is all right.
yeah?
yeah.
what they like?
ginger's mad, he says things all the time and eddy's good at punching and spitting.
how about ding dong?
he is a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it is all right 'cos he is one of the gang.
why are not you at work?
I am a deserter, too.
oh.
oh, there you are!
oh, I am sorry, i must have made a mistake.
you haven't, you are just late.  oh, yes, he is going to be very pleased with you.
is he?
yes, you are quite a feather in the cap.  hello, I have got one ... oh, i think so ... yes, he can talk ... well ... i think you ought to see him.  of course, right away.
well ... come on.
sorry.
look, I am terribly sorry but I am afraid there is been some sort of a misunderstanding.
oh, you can come off it with us. you do not have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
I am afraid i do not understand.
oh, my god, he is a natural.
we want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
oh, by all means, I would be quite prepared for that eventuality.
well, not your real opinion, naturally. it will be written out and you will learn it.  can he read?
of course i can.
i mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
I will have a bash.
good. hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
ta.
well, at least he is polite. tony show him the shirts, adrian.
now, you will like these. you really "dig" them. they are "fab" and all the other pimply hyperboles.
i would not be seen dead in them. they are dead grotty.
grotty?
yeah, grotesque.
make a note of that word and give it to susan. i think it is rather touching really. here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when i know for a fact within four weeks he will be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he is not wearing one of these nasty things. of course they are grotty, you wretched nit, that is why they were designed, but that is what you will want.
but i won't.
you can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
i do not care.
and that pose is out too, sunny jim. the new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. anyway, you will not meet susan if you do not cooperate.
and who is this susan when she is at home?
only susan campey, our resident teenager. you will have to love her. she is your symbol.
oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
i beg your pardon?
oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the t.v. set to watch her for a giggle. once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
she is a trend setter. it is her profession!
she is a drag. a well-known drag. we turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
get him out of here!!
have i said something amiss?
get him out of here. he is knocking the programme's image!!
oh!
well ... go 'head, do the next bit.
go away! you have spoilt it.
oh, sorry i spoke.
are you supposed to be here?
I have got you worried, have not i?
I am warning you, they will be back in a minute.
d'you know something, "they" do not worry me at all. anyroad, i only fancy listening to you ... that is all but if it worries you ... well ...
you are from liverpool, are not you?
how did you guess?
oh, it is the way you talk.
is it ... is it, really?
are you pulling my leg?
something like that.
i see.  do you like the play?
yeah ... i mean, sure, well, i took it at school but i only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  yeah, it is gear on a girl.
gear?
aye, the big hammer, smashing!
thank you.
do not mench ... well, why do not you give us a few more lines, like?
you do not half slam the door in people's faces, do you? i mean, what about when you are playing the part, like, hundreds of people'll see you and ...
I am not ...
oh, you are the understudy, sort of thing?
no.  I am a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. i just felt like doing those lines.
oh, i see. you are an actress though, are not you?
yes.
aye, i knew you were.
what is that mean?
well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "i do not believe you, sir..." and all that. yeah, it was gear.
the big hammer?
oh aye, a sledge.
but the way you did it then sounded so phony.
no ... i would not say that ... just like an actress ... you know.
but that is not like a real person at all.
aye well, actresses are not like real people, are they?
they ought to be.
oh, i do not know, anyroad up, they never are, are they?
what are you?
I am in a group ... well ... there are four of us, we play and sing.
i bet you do not sound like real people.
we do, you know. we sound like us having a ball. it is fab.
is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
what of? look, i would not do it unless i was. I am dead lucky 'cos i get paid for doing something i love doing.
... all this and a jam butty too!!
i only enjoy acting for myself. i hate it when other people are let in.
why? i mean, which are you, scared or selfish?
why selfish?
well, you have got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.
no, hang on, I have not gone daft. you see, when i was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. when I would done she said to me, "go and give some to the other kids." so, i said i would but i thought to meself, "she must think I am soft." anyroad, i was eating away there but i wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end i wound up giving it all away ... but i did not mind, mind, 'cos I would made the stuff in the first place. well ... that is why you need other people... an audience ... to taste your treacle toffee, like. eh ... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?
not really but I am probably not a toffee maker. how would you do those lines of mine?
well, look at it this way, i mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she is a bit of a scrubber, is not she?
is she?
of course ... look, if she was a liverpool scrubber ...  eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it is got a full set of bells hanging off it ... y'what? ... i know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it is love and we are stopping in an empty shop doorway. you are just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
and you honestly think that is what she meant?
oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she is trying to get him to marry her but he does not want ... well ... i do not reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. but girls are like that, clever and cunning. you have got to laugh.
well, it is nice to know you think we are clever.
and cunning.
and what do you do about it?
me? oh, i do not have the time, I am always running about with the lads ... no, we do not have the time.
pity.
aye, it is but as long as you get by, it is all right, you know ... bash on, happy valley's when they let you stop. anyroad, I would better get back.
yes.
see you.
of course.
well, that is it, two minutes to the final run-through... they are bound to miss it...
I will murder that lennon.
but i suppose we can survive a missed run-through as long...
... as they head up for the show. oh yes, well i mean it'ud be a pity to miss the show, would not it like.
shurrup, cheerful.
you do not think...
they will be here.
oh now, they can not do that to me.  it is all your fault.  oh yes it is and if they do not turn up i would not be in your shoes for all the...
hi norm!
hi, our lot!
sorry.
eh, there is only three of them.
control yourself or you will spurt. he is bound to be somewhere.
aye, let's try the dressing room.
eh, where is my grandfather?
do not worry about him. he can look after himself.
aye, i suppose so.
what is he?
I have got a little list here. wandering abroad. malicious intent. acting in a suspicious manner. conduct liable to cause a breach of the peace. you name it, he is done it.
oh, a little savage, is he?
a proper aborigine.
well, you got me here so do your worst but I will take one of you with me.  oh, i know your game, get me in the tiled room and out come the rubber hoses but I will defy you still.
is there a fire, then?
you ugly, great brute you, you have sadism stamped all over your bloated british kisser.
eh?
I will go on a hunger strike. i know your caper. the kidney punch and the rabbit-clout. the third degree and the size twelve boot ankle-tap.
what is he on about?
I am soldier of the republic, you will need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. a nation once again.
get lloyd george over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while i sort this lot out.
ringo, me old scout, they grabbed yer leg for the iron too, did they?
well I am not exactly a voluntary patient.
shush! have they roughed you up yet?
what?
keep your voice down, this lot'll paste you, just for the exercise. oh they are a desperate crew of drippings and they have fists like matured hams for pounding defenceless lads like you.
have they?
that sergeant's a body-blow veteran if ever i measured one. one of us has got to escape. I will get the boys. hold on son, I will be back for you.
me!
and if they get you on the floor watch out for your brisket.
oh, they seem all right to me.
that is what they want you to think. all coppers are villains.
would you two like a cup of tea?
you see, sly villains.
so you just brought the old chap out of the crowd for his own good.
yeah, but he insisted on us bringing him to the station.
well, he can not stop here.
what are you doing?
lip reading.
what are they saying?
nothing good.
can you fix him for me?
yeah.
sixpence.
the police have the poor unfortunate lad in the bridewell.
the police station.
he will be pulp by now.
what are we waiting for?
come here.
boys, you do not know what this means to me. if you had not come back it would have been the epilogue or the news in welsh for life.
are not you supposed to be in that box?
and another thing, where is that old mixer?
here, pauly.
well, i got a few things to say to you, two-faced john mccartney.
aw, leave him alone paul, he is back, is not he? and it is not his fault he is old.
what is old got to do with it?
you need not bother.
y'what?
practising to be thick-headed, you are there already.
look he is a mixer and a trouble maker!
that is right, but he is only asking us to pay attention to him, are not you?
you see.  you know your trouble -- you should have gone west to america. you would have wound up a senior citizen of boston. as it is you took the wrong turning and what happened, you are a lonely old man from liverpool.
but I am clean.
I have got the stuff. come here.
are not we ...
no, we are not!
the office was on the phone, they think it would be better if we pushed straight to wolverhampton.
tonight? we can not make it ...
you have got a midnight matinee.
now, look here, norm ...
no, you look here, john. I have only one thing to say to you.
what?
you are a swine. so hurry up ... we are travelling!
where is my grandfather?
do not start. look.
