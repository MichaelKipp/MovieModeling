what color hair does he have?
black hair. paul michael glaser.
making hutch david soul?
right. the blond guy.
ok. that's wrong.
dignan, it's --
plus where's huggie bear?
he's not there. huggie bear isn't in every single episode.
i think you might of dreamed this one, anthony.
no. it's a real episode. the killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
why?
as part of his plan. i don't know why.
see, that's what i'm saying. it has the logic of a dream.
the point is the killer always goes, may i speak to starsky? he says his name.
what does starsky say?
he says. this is he.
this is he?
no. this is he.
did you see what i meant about the window?
kind of. except we've already got the keys.
that's true. but what if they change the locks?
would they do that?
who knows? that's why i filed it down.
now that window can never be locked. it's impossible.
see, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. whereas my strength would be --
she's really kind of hot.
she's an attractive older woman.
well, what do you think?
i don't know, bob. what about one of those?
i'm not allowed to drive those.
not even for emergencies?
no.
i thought your parents were in italy.
they are.
so who's going to know?
my brother.
future man.
who?
future man. you know. cause he looks like he's from the future.
he looks like he was designed by scientists. for desert warfare.
that never would of --
let's cut the bullshit.
it's got a v-8, dignan.
what do you think the cops have?
if you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
what are you talking about, bob?
can you use a coaster.
did you ever steal a car before?
yeah. i've stolen two cars before. one jaguar. and one trans-am. with t- tops. that trans-am was fun to drive.
you stole a trans-am.
yes. i did.
ok, bob.
it's true, dignan.
well. what do you want to do? you want to steal one or just drive your car?
i'll just drive my car.
anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. that's less than what it's appraised at.
but dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
i know about money, anthony. i know the value of money. plus the earrings are worth three times that.
the list, dignan. i know you remember the list because you signed it. "things dignan was not supposed to touch."
every valuable item in the house was on that list.
that doesn't make any difference. i bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. they have a very special value for her.
yeah, but i can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. there's just not time for it.
then you shouldn't of gone in there, dignan. maybe we should of robbed your house. did you ever think of that?
where are you going?
i don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
how was i ridiculing you?
you're making fun of my family. you know there's nothing to steal from my mom and craig. you know exactly what you're saying.
that's not what i meant, dignan.
did you see that?
yeah, i saw it.
i'm lookout.
dignan, it's got an alarm.
i don't think so. just reach on in.
that sets it off.
no, just do it real quick.  i'll meet you down there.
it had an alarm.
yeah, i heard that.
five, seven, eight dollars.
holy shit. what'd i tell you?
eight dollars.
that's not bad.
what do herbs have to do with it? i don't understand the --
pot is an herb. it's just like any type of gardening.
how much could you grow? realistically.
as much as i want. when these plants bud i'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
six thousand dollars? come on, bob.
you should take a look. i have an entire crop in my backyard.
in your backyard? how do you protect them?
it's private property. plus i have hector.
hector woudn't do anything.
but he's got a loud bark. that's the most important thing is a loud bark.
if it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
good question.
don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
you're paranoid, bob.
yeah, but don't tell anybody.
could you grow cinnamon?
i don't know. sure, i guess.
you could make your own cinnamon toast.
are you a fag?
you're the faggot.
dignan and anthony, this is little richard. he's crazy. totally nuts.
i don't know about that.
little richard. trust me. you're insane. jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. you do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
it seemed like a good idea at the time.
the one and only little richard.
what was that all about?
i can't believe you said that.
what did i say?
i told you he's crazy.
but he didn't say anything.
hang on a second.
let them fight.
let them fight.
is it back in?
yeah.
the guy is fucking insane.
i warned you, dignan.
you said it like it was a big joke, bob. like he's wild.
no, i was saying crazy like a lunatic.
i know that now. he's a fucking psycho.
well, don't blame me. i told you.
i do blame you, bob. and woah. look at her.
loop around real fast.
just turn right here.
where'd she go?
maybe she turned.
i think we might of scared her.
let's just go.
ok. escape route. the most important thing you can have is an escape route. just in case somebody's tailing us. or even chasing us, as the case may be --
you think we're going to be chased?
that's a good question. no. i don't. i'm just being hypocritical here. however, i will say --
i'm going to take a look at this.
hang on. this is important, bob. anthony and i are responsible for the internal situation. the money and the people. you're responsible for the external situation. the streets and the getaway.
that's my responsibility.
that's your domain.
ok.
now. one thing we need to discuss is timing. timing is absolutely crucial. what are you doing? anthony!
nothing. go ahead.
bob.
i'm paying attention. i just want to look at it for a minute.
what's your fucking problem? you're a shithead!
i just want to see how much bullets it takes.
anthony, give me the fucking gun!
no, dignan. it's not your gun. it's all of ours.
i paid for it.
god dammit.
dignan, calm down.
you're out! i'm not working with either one of you!
dignan! stop!
calm down. take a deep breath.
you're right. you're right.
he doesn't get it. held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. it's too dangerous for him.
well, in reality it's not that dangerous, bob. it's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?
you know, bob, anthony did kill someone. he electrocuted our janitor senior year.
he electrocuted someone?
it was an accidental. i don't want to go into the details. it was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. i mean, obviously, since swifty's dead. that's why anthony never graduated.
his name was swifty?
yeah. one of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
that's too bad.
you know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. at least swifty's did.
what are you doing?
i'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
we're closed, sir.
where's that guy going?
he left his sweater.
well, i left some money in there.
where?
in the cash register. step away from the door.
where's the manager?
where's the other stocker?
there's another stocker, right?
we know there's another stocker.
where is he? where is rob?
i don't know. maybe in literature. that's his section.
you got that?
is that the manager?
unlock that door.  check the aisles.
what happened?
shhh. slow down, bob. drive natural.
this is natural.
that's good. keep it at forty.
did we get it?
be cool, bob. be cool.  make that light.
holy shit.
we got it. we got it.
how much is there?
don't count it.
was dignan screaming like, get me a bag!
no. i was calm.
what about what that guy said?
oh, shit. that was scary. in the middle of the robbery. the manager looks at me. right in the eye. and goes, i'm going to remember you.
are you serious?
yeah. he said that.
i swear to god. in a very quiet voice.
like he meant it.
yeah.
like he would find dignan. one day.
like i'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
you really think he'll remember you?
no. all he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
see you.
see you, bob.
what's wrong with him?
what do you think?
anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. he got what he deserved.
he was the driver, dignan. he did what he's supposed to do.
i didn't realize you were so sensitive to bob's feelings. considering i did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
don't even say it, man.
bob, will you please listen?
i don't want to talk about it.
i mean, jesus christ, bob. you didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "i'm going to remember you!"
that's true. that would give me nightmares.
bob, i've got nightmares.
you'll probably have them the rest of your life.
what was that?
how long do you have to go?
26 weeks.
and what does that cover?
social issues. crime prevention.
hand to hand combat?
ground defense.
did you hear that?
what the fuck is dignan doing with that cop? he loves them.
there's a million places to hide around here.
oh, yeah. they'll never catch the guy.
i hope not.
phil probably provoked him.  where's he going?
where you going?
move.
way to go, bob!
i told you they were there.
so it's my fault?
in all probability nothing would of happened. but why take the chance? that's why i ran. i mean how many plants were even back there? five? ten?
there were more than that.
why don't you just tell them the truth. those belong to my neighbor phil.
i don't know. i personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
nobody does.
can i get that credit card from you?
i don't like to use that credit card, dignan.
why not?
because my mom gets the bill.
she's not going to notice, anthony.
i don't want to use it.
well, then cut it in half.
i keep it for emergencies.
anthony, we're on the run. this is an emergency. it's only fair that...
see if mine are in there.
dignan, those aren't running shoes.
yes, they are.
look at the treads on those.
what about them?
they obviously weren't designed for racing.
well, those treads stink. you'd blow a knee out racing on those.
will you guys shut up? god. it's like having two little kids in the car.
ok, dad.
really. ok, dad. but seriously, anthony. these are fast shoes.
you've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, dignan.  in fifth grade dignan used to wear cowboy boots for p.e.
that's real cool, anthony. yeah, i wore boots. my parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. i wasn't spoiled.
don't call me spoiled, dignan.
you were spoiled rotten.
i'll just say it.
i'll say it.
ok. go ahead.
on your marks...  get set go.
you owe me fifty bucks.
bob?
look, man. she didn't know anything about shirts.
no, i'm not saying her. i'm just saying, i don't know.
it's a great shirt. don't worry about it.
armored trucks are very difficult to steal, anthony.
i know. but once you get inside you're home free.
right. get back to me on that one. once your plan is worth a shit.
it's not a plan. it's just --
actually. if you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
true.
shit, bob. what the fuck did you do that for?
he wouldn't move.
is he chasing us?
i don't know.
you think he got my license plates?
he looked too shaken-up.
i'm sure he did. we'll have to get new plates.
it's registered in my mother's name.
what the fuck possessed you?
you're the one who kept saying ram him.
dignan, i can't get my hair cut. that's just not possible, all right?
then you're going to have to dye it, anthony. we've got to hide our identities. especially after bob crashed the car.
no, dignan. i'm sorry. i can't do that.
even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
bob. are you coming?
see you in a little while.
how do you say nineteen?
dies y nueve.
right. yeah. yo soy dies y nueve. how old are you?
are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
no.
it could happen. this is the exact kind of place where it happens. but i don't want to scare you.
were you born in mexico?
cuba.
oh, really? that's interesting. do you prefer cuba or the united states?
you can go first, bob.
my brother's in jail.
what are you talking about?
the weed.
but it's not his. how can they arrest future man?
they said he's a drug dealer.
i don't think they can make it stick, bob. i mean, what do they actually have on future man?
well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
that could be anybody's.
they also found my two beam scale in the garage.
since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? everybody has a scale.
the cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
so tell them the truth. what do you use it for?
i was just going to use it to see how much i had.
how long has he been in there?
i don't know.
then how come they haven't set the bail yet? that's unconstitutional.
we'll have to see when we get back.
what do you mean get back?
well, obviously, we got to go back.
bob, that makes no sense.
dignan, he's my brother. i can't just leave him there.
this could be a trap.
come on, dignan.
don't "come on, dignan" me.
i'm going back.
not in that car you're not.
watch me.
good luck, since i got the keys.
give me the keys, dignan.
i can't do that, bob.
dignan. you're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
don't threaten me, bob.
goddammit, dignan! it's my car! if you don't give me my keys, i swear to god --
future man would never go to jail for you, i'll tell you that.
his name's not future man, dignan.
i know it's not.
you don't even know his name.
yes, i do.
what is it?
just get in the car, bob.
what's his name?
ok, bob. i don't know his name. you know why? because i don't care. he's future man. but i care about you. and to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. will you get in the car, bob? this is stupid.
it's not your decision and he's not your brother, dignan.
that's right. i only have one vote. we'll go talk with anthony and figure it out.
you've got a beautiful walk, bob.
let's go.
i thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
no. we didn't.
this is inez. carmen. anita.
hi.
inez, this is --
jerry.  and this is my associate cornelius.
may i have a word with you, please?
sure.
what the fuck is going on here?
what. what's the matter?
anthony, we're on the run from the law here. did you tell these people your real name?
no. i didn't. dignan, they don't speak english.
they don't?
no. not really. inez speaks a little.
which one was that?
on the left.
she's from cuba.
no kidding.
dignan.
anthony. bad news.
how long are they going to hold him?
i don't know. i don't know anything. except phil says they got him. and he's in jail.
he needs to hire an attorney.
no, no. look. ok. let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
anthony, i --
and if future man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. all right?
now that makes sense. we'll hang out for a couple of days. get a little r&r. make sure future man's ok and then get back on the road.
as long as he gets out ok.
obviously. that's a given.
bob?
what?
is that ok?
see, now we've got a plan.
don't worry about it, bob.
does my skin feel soft, anthony?
god, yes. like silk.
what?  what?
like silk?
god. that does sound corny. oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. but it really kind of does.
see, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor mr. langston's house and anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. i had to dive in and save him.
this was in fourth grade.
mr. langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. cpr. i've never said this before, but frankly i thought anthony was dead. the veins in his face were all sticking out. his skin was blue. he truly did look dead.
after that my parents never let me go to dignan's again.
they blamed my family for everything. they always said mr. langston saved anthony's life.
but if it wasn't for dignan i probably would of died.
yes... it's true.
he's gone. he stole the car.
where was it parked?
right here.
that coward. son of a bitch.
maybe he just went to the store.
he took his stuff. he's gone.  i should of seen this. i should of expected it. bob doesn't have any character.
he went back for his brother.
we said 48 hours.
that's a long time to be in jail.
when'd he tell you?
this morning.
where was i?
you were asleep.
he told you and you let him do it.
he told me because he wanted to know if i wanted to go.
if you wanted to go? what were you going to do? just leave me here by myself?
well, i didn't do it, did i?
so when you were saying bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. you were just --
bob went to help his brother. i understand that and i can't help it if you don't.
i understand that if i had a few more friends like you and bob i'd be dead.
if you say so.
if you'd gone with bob you'd probably be in weatherford by now. of course i'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
i didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, dignan.
well, the world is a little bit colder today.
we're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
no. i'm going to swim. i'll see you later.
why don't you come with us.
ok.
hello, my friend. you in the army, yes?
no. i just have short hair.
is that your chiquita?
no, my friend knows her.
she chicano, yes?
you like chicanos?
sure.
you a good pool player.
got a little lucky.
where's your friend? he go with the chiquita?
i don't know.
she is a good looking woman.
guess i'll get another tecate.
si. tecate. you like to fight?
what?
fight. you know.
no. just pool.
you hoto?
fuck you. you a hoto.
no. me no hoto. tecate?
right.
i can't believe he just jumped you.
can you hand me those french fries.
i wish i'd been there.
would of been nice.
man. i'm sorry. we just went for a walk --
i don't really feel like talking about it. the only thing i feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
we need a car.
i have an idea for that.
what?
inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  doesn't she?
i don't think we can do that.
i know we can. it's real simple. we go into a room, grab some car keys and --
what i'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
she doesn't need to know.
i don't know, dignan. i just --
look. i'm ready to get the fuck out of here. it's real torture for me to be here. getting the shit kicked out of me by mexicans.
shh.
no one to back me up. now i have a good idea. so unless you come up with something better --
dignan. i can't do that. all right? i just can't.
i don't think we need any keys, dignan. i think i can hotwire a car for us.
you don't know how to hotwire.
yes, i do. bob taught me.
bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
no, i'm serious. he made me a diagram.
i think we better go home.
don't panic, anthony.
i'm not. but there's --
you can't just run home every time things get tough. first of all, we've got enough dough to --
our money situation is not good.
you're so spoiled. what is "not good" to you? only a few hundred --
we've got sixteen dollars.
that's not correct.
sixteen dollars.
i know.
where's the rest?
i had to give some to inez.
how much?
$383.
you gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! what the fuck is your problem?
she needed it.
a $500 tip! for the housekeeper!
her name's inez. stop calling her the housekeeper.
that's what she is!
i know that. but --
you're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
shut up!
what are you going to do, get married? have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! and go around scrubbing the --
bob, where you going?
i'm not playing any more golf.
why not?
cause i'm not getting any better. it's a waste of time.
you've only been playing for two weeks, bob. it takes a long time to learn this game.
you think i'm improving?
yes. you just got to stick with it.
you don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
no, i don't mind.
i know it must of been a bad experience. but it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
well, i didn't mean to electrocute him. but the whole operation was my idea.
it took six months of research. i did all the wiring myself. switched ac to dc. doubled the voltage. shorted out the generator. the whole school was shut down.
that's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
i don't like that word prank, bob. i was trying to do something more than a prank.
at first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. that's partly why i was in custody so long. sixty days.
sixty days?
yeah. one minute you're studying great expectations and the next minute you're drawing the holy mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
why were you drawing the holy mary?
prison tatoos. i got to be pretty good. it's not like drawing on paper.
how's that 700 bucks coming?
i'm working on it.
hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
i thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
yeah, but he still has the aggravation. three days sitting in a cell.
were you adopted, bob?
why do you say that?
well, because you guys don't look alike.
no. i wasn't adopted.
was future man adopted?
jesus christ! no.
there's a lot of valuable shit in there, applejack. the silver and the china. the crystal. and the grandfather clock. goddammit, i bet that clock's worth ten grand.
why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? it doesn't make any goddamn sense.
just settling an old score. you might say revenge.
that sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
we might have to take that chance. cause i feel pretty strongly about this.
is that buckethead?
is that him?
wait a second.
that's anthony.
that's your friend anthony?
yeah.
what's he doing here?
looks like he's staying with buckethead. that's what i figured. he's probably got his own room. let's see where he's going.
wait. did he see us?
we're going too slow. it looks like we're following him.
when'd you get back?
ah. couple days ago.
who's in the car?
that's applejack. you want to meet him?
sure.
nice to meet you, applejack.
you're anthony?
yeah.
i hear you're a good thief.
applejack would of got him anyway. this was just the quicker way.
you really hit a guy with a bottle?
i want you to look at this.
what is it?
it's big, anthony. real big. it's called hinckley cold storage.
what's hinckley cold storage?
mr. henry has an inside source. we call him steve. that's where we get our information.
who's mr. henry?
you'll meet him this afternoon. he's helping us set it up.
did you ever hear of the s. cooper trust robbery?
uh-uh.
s. cooper trust, in san francisco?
uh-uh.
mr. henry pulled that job in 1965. it's famous. applejack was the wheel man. did you use this same car, applejack?
hell, no. this is a '72. i was driving a '63 pontiac.
what exactly is this place? freezers?
right. freezers. imported foods.
let's go, abdul-shabazz.
abdul-shabazz?
what time did he say to be here?
right now.
i can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
what do you mean?
feel this.
you could give somebody a concussion.
let me feel that.
how's the weather down there?
mr. henry?
come on in!
it's locked.
no, it's not.
dignan. good to see you. good to see you applejack.  who are you?
this is anthony adams, mr. henry.
this is no good.
this is my business manager, rowboat.
nice to meet you.
that's a sharp jacket.
thanks.
it's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
it's called a racquet, anthony, and you're holding it wrong. that's ghetto play. hold it like this.
you know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
thanks.
is he in?
i don't know. are you in, anthony?
every once in a while some cat comes to me. he wants to know how i made it. how did i become a success?  the first thing i tell them is: follow your instincts. let your instincts guide you. the second thing i tell them is, for christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
grammar.
what do you mean grammar?
the basic grammatical rules of robbing.
you mean like techniques?
technique. that's right. seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. seventy-five percent. do you believe that?
i'd like to live in that place. hinckley cold storage.
yeah. convert it into lofts. ok. pop quiz. what's the single most important aspect of your job?
the grammar?
crowd control. crowd control. wake up, guys.
oh, yeah.
you're going to need a boxman for this one. but that can be arranged.
you mean a safecracker?
yeah. and i'll tell you who we're going to want: kumar banijamali.
is he good?
he's damn good.
what do you think?
he seems pretty good.
hey, dignan. how's it going?
not bad.
come on in. what you been up to?
not a whole lot, bob.
it's too bad about what happened on the road.
yeah. it is.
let's not even talk about it.
it was stupid.
right. it was extremely stupid.
i don't expect an apology and i don't even want one. i just want us to --
i can't fucking believe this guy. an apology, bob?
man, i don't want to go into this.
yeah. let's keep it --
cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
you said 48 hours!
i never agreed to that.
bob, you're lying!
bullshit.
all right! backyard! right now!
dignan. take it easy.
bob!
he doesn't want to fight.
get out of the way.
no, dignan. this isn't --
come on!
i don't want to fight you, dignan.
no fighting. it wasn't bob's fault.
easy, dignan. it's ok.
it wasn't your fault, bob. you had your brother.
i didn't have any choice.
i'm sorry, bob.
that's ok.
shit, dignan.
what the fuck are we doing out here?
i don't know, dignan. you went crazy.
i'm sorry, bob.
that's ok.
look. we want you on the job.
how you doing, bob?
hey, jackson. how's it going?
you keeping out of trouble?
i'm trying.
this boy's a troublemaker. he used to tear this place apart.
your brother was up here the other day. he said you ran away from home.
he said what?
he said you ran away from home.
no. i didn't run away. i went out of town.
fancy seeing you here, bob.
yeah. hey, clay.
john mapplethorpe.  how are you. hi.
good to know you, john.
i might have mentioned it.
john, i'm twenty-six years old i didn't run away from home.
i know, bob. you were on a secret mission.
i'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
right. i'm sorry.  you've got a reputation to think about.
the world needs dreamers, son.
what?
the world needs dreamers. to relieve the pain of consciousness.
well, we'll see you later, bob.
pleasure to meet you, john.
nice to meet you.
ok. man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. he is entering a white van. what time is it?
eleven fifteen.
ok. mark that down.
i did.
god. isn't this great? working on the job. got a wheel man. got a safecracker. good friends with mr. henry.
yeah. it's pretty good.
it's like we've finally arrived.
look at that woman. she's what? fifty? fifty-five? but she hasn't let herself go. i appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
so do i.
tell me something. what the hell kind of name is dignan?
i'm not really sure. i think it's irish. or maybe --
i guess what i'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this dignan?
what do you mean what kind of person? he's a good person.
sure, sure. he's a great person, and i'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. but i wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
i don't think you're giving him enough credit. i know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. he gets too excited. but --
as far as i can tell he hasn't thought his life through. he'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. but business?  you i can work with. you i could groom. dignan's not going to make it.
and you're wrong if you think, i'd turn my back on a friend.
hold it.
congratulations. you passed the test.
what do you mean?
the abe henry double-cross test. you just made a perfect score.
that was a test?
take a deep breath.
how does that feel?
it feels good.
did dignan take the test?
yes, he did.
how'd he do?
well, he agreed 100% that bob should be dropped. and he also agreed you were a liability. but he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
that sounds like dignan.
i don't know why the fuck we're having a party. the damn job's not over yet.
well, this isn't really a party per se.
you don't celebrate til it's over.
true.
i'll tell you, anthony. times like this i get philosophical. what does it mean? what's it all about? are you afraid to die?
me?
no, that door over there.
i don't want to die.
are you afraid?
yeah. i mean, i don't think about it all the time. but once in awhile i kind of go, woah. man.
exactly. woah.
death.
the fear of death, the pain of consciousness.  did you mix this martini?
no. bob did.
bob. bob. that's a palindrome.  i love palindromes.
are you afraid to die, mr. henry?
anthony, i'm petrified.
come on, bob.
i know it, man. hang on.
jesus christ.
give him a second.
hopscotch. the code name is hopscotch.
join the party, fellas.
we're just going over a few things.
you got to have fun with it. there's no point if you're not having any fun. would you like me to be there tomorrow?
yes.
why?
well, i think --
no, if i go out on this job, then it's just another score by mr. henry. and i don't see it like that. this is your job. your creation. i want you to try this.
this is good.
i want to ask a favor, boys. one day, when i'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to abe henry. and remember me as a friend.
but you're thieves. it's what you are.
yeah.
it's an esoteric journey.
we're renegades from despair.
can i ask you something, mr. henry?
absolutely.
why'd you want to help us?
because i was like you once. and there was no one there to help me.
next week we'll be drinking piña coladas.
hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
or i might end up with a broken nose.
did that hurt?
i'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
i don't think you will.
i don't want to be too much of a liability.
look, you're going to do fine. it's ok to be scared.
i don't think i ever said this to you. but it meant a lot to me the way you were after that swifty stuff happened.
he was a nice guy.
he was all right.
do you like inez?
as a person?
yeah. as a girl.
yes. i do.
so do i.
you ok, bob?
no, i'm having a heart attack. of course, i'm ok. what's that supposed to mean?
nothing. i was just asking.
no, i know. i'm just saying. i feel fine. you want a piece of cake?
sure.
bird dog to scarecrow. bird dog to scarecrow.
go ahead, bird dog.
you're all clear.
roger.
we all set?
hang on a second.
scarecrow?
yeah?
everything ok?
yeah. we're in the elevator. how's it look back there?
it looks pretty good. there's nobody back here.
stand by. bird dog?
uh-huh?
take your second position.
ok. roger.
where did he go?
who? applejack?
why did he go that way?
he's going to watch the back stairwell, remember?  don't worry about it.
i'm in position, scarecrow.
any activity?
not at all. the place is totally deserted.
good. it's supposed to be.
i've got a great view up here. i can see all the --
stand by, bird dog.
i don't know.
check the fucking elevator. it's moving.
what are you doing?
my walkie talkie's busted. i can't tell what's going on.
let me see it.  did you drop it?
no.
what's happening? what's going on?
it was bob. his walkie talkie's busted.
i couldn't hear anything.
who's watching the door? what the fuck are you doing? get back in position.
who did that? what the fuck is that?
it's going back down.
applejack! what's happening?
what?
bob! get back in position!
where'd they come from?
the front stairs.
where were you?
what's the story?
can't get it. it won't...
what can we do?
freeze!
nobody move!
get against the wall!
jesus, bob.
i didn't do anything.
what's wrong with applejack?
he's having a heart attack or something.
let's go!
help me move him.
careful. check his pulse.
is he breathing?
i think so.
jesus christ. what the fuck is that?
i didn't think there was an alarm.
take him to the car, bob.
who tripped the alarm?
it's the fire alarm. somebody pulled the fire alarm.
where's kumar?
i don't know.
jesus christ, anthony. did you lose him?
what are you doing?
let's go. come on.
wait for kumar.
come on, kumar.
the elevator broke.
where's applejack?
he's stuck between two floors.
you're kidding.
applejack's stuck in the elevator?
yeah.
who's got the car keys?
applejack drove.
run. run. let's go.
come on.
i'll see you there.
what?
i'll see you there.
what are you talking about?
i'll get him.
there's not enough time.
yes, there is. let's get organized.
dignan, it's too late.
i don't think so.
i said to the da, that cop who hit me must of given me crs disease.
what's that?
that's just what the da asked. crs is a disease where you can't remember shit.
like amnesia.
can't remember shit. crs.
so is mr. henry going to come by and see me or anything?
i don't think so. i mean. actually, he robbed bob's house.
he did?
yeah.
you got to be kidding me.
i'm not kidding.
what'd he get?
pretty much everything.
the grandfather clock?
you think applejack knew?
we haven't heard from applejack since he got out of the hospital. his case got dismissed.
why?
we're not sure.
we think mr. henry maybe --
his health isn't very good, you know. they take that into account.
mr. henry never gave you a test, did he?
what do you mean?
nothing.
you're living on a sailboat?
it belongs to bob's uncle.
how big is it?
oh, i'd say about --
it's in the driveway.
temporarily.
where?
behind bob's house.
does it float?
we're not sure yet. it's going to need some repairs.
so how is it in there?
what can i say? it's jail. you don't sleep when you want to. you don't eat when you want to.
do you have your own room?
we don't have rooms, bob. we have cells.
do you have your own cell?
no. i have a cellmate. his name's carl.
what's he in for?
he stole a tractor.
do they let you --
i don't really want to talk about it, bob.
i think i may have found a way out of here.
you're kidding.
no. i'm not.
how?
shhh. wait for my instructions.
dignan, i --
when we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.
what?
have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. bob and i'll --
dignan, i --
scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. and bob. remember:
scale the --
shield me from the bullets. they won't shoot civilians. ready?
hold on --
here we go.
wait a second --
now!
what color hair does he have?
black hair. paul michael glaser.
making hutch david soul?
right. the blond guy.
ok. that's wrong.
dignan, it's --
plus where's huggie bear?
he's not there. huggie bear isn't in every single episode.
i think you might of dreamed this one, anthony.
no. it's a real episode. the killer is leading him across the city by calling different pay phones.
why?
as part of his plan. i don't know why.
see, that's what i'm saying. it has the logic of a dream.
the point is the killer always goes, may i speak to starsky? he says his name.
what does starsky say?
he says. this is he.
this is he?
no. this is he.
did you see what i meant about the window?
kind of. except we've already got the keys.
that's true. but what if they change the locks?
would they do that?
who knows? that's why i filed it down.
now that window can never be locked. it's impossible.
see, your mind is very good with the more mechanical details. whereas my strength would be --
she's really kind of hot.
she's an attractive older woman.
well, what do you think?
i don't know, bob. what about one of those?
i'm not allowed to drive those.
not even for emergencies?
no.
i thought your parents were in italy.
they are.
so who's going to know?
my brother.
future man.
who?
future man. you know. cause he looks like he's from the future.
he looks like he was designed by scientists. for desert warfare.
that never would of --
let's cut the bullshit.
it's got a v-8, dignan.
what do you think the cops have?
if you're that worried, maybe we should just steal one.
what are you talking about, bob?
can you use a coaster.
did you ever steal a car before?
yeah. i've stolen two cars before. one jaguar. and one trans-am. with t- tops. that trans-am was fun to drive.
you stole a trans-am.
yes. i did.
ok, bob.
it's true, dignan.
well. what do you want to do? you want to steal one or just drive your car?
i'll just drive my car.
anthony, we'll get two hundred for the coin collection alone. that's less than what it's appraised at.
but dignan, do you really know that much about rare coins?
i know about money, anthony. i know the value of money. plus the earrings are worth three times that.
the list, dignan. i know you remember the list because you signed it. "things dignan was not supposed to touch."
every valuable item in the house was on that list.
that doesn't make any difference. i bought those earrings for my mother on her birthday. they have a very special value for her.
yeah, but i can't be sorting through that shit in the middle of a burglary. there's just not time for it.
then you shouldn't of gone in there, dignan. maybe we should of robbed your house. did you ever think of that?
where are you going?
i don't appreciate you ridiculing me.
how was i ridiculing you?
you're making fun of my family. you know there's nothing to steal from my mom and craig. you know exactly what you're saying.
that's not what i meant, dignan.
did you see that?
yeah, i saw it.
i'm lookout.
dignan, it's got an alarm.
i don't think so. just reach on in.
that sets it off.
no, just do it real quick.  i'll meet you down there.
it had an alarm.
yeah, i heard that.
five, seven, eight dollars.
holy shit. what'd i tell you?
eight dollars.
that's not bad.
what do herbs have to do with it? i don't understand the --
pot is an herb. it's just like any type of gardening.
how much could you grow? realistically.
as much as i want. when these plants bud i'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
six thousand dollars? come on, bob.
you should take a look. i have an entire crop in my backyard.
in your backyard? how do you protect them?
it's private property. plus i have hector.
hector woudn't do anything.
but he's got a loud bark. that's the most important thing is a loud bark.
if it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
good question.
don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
you're paranoid, bob.
yeah, but don't tell anybody.
could you grow cinnamon?
i don't know. sure, i guess.
you could make your own cinnamon toast.
are you a fag?
you're the faggot.
dignan and anthony, this is little richard. he's crazy. totally nuts.
i don't know about that.
little richard. trust me. you're insane. jesus, this guy used to carry a percussion bomb around in his trunk. you do not want a guy like that loose on the streets.
it seemed like a good idea at the time.
the one and only little richard.
what was that all about?
i can't believe you said that.
what did i say?
i told you he's crazy.
but he didn't say anything.
hang on a second.
let them fight.
let them fight.
is it back in?
yeah.
the guy is fucking insane.
i warned you, dignan.
you said it like it was a big joke, bob. like he's wild.
no, i was saying crazy like a lunatic.
i know that now. he's a fucking psycho.
well, don't blame me. i told you.
i do blame you, bob. and woah. look at her.
loop around real fast.
just turn right here.
where'd she go?
maybe she turned.
i think we might of scared her.
let's just go.
ok. escape route. the most important thing you can have is an escape route. just in case somebody's tailing us. or even chasing us, as the case may be --
you think we're going to be chased?
that's a good question. no. i don't. i'm just being hypocritical here. however, i will say --
i'm going to take a look at this.
hang on. this is important, bob. anthony and i are responsible for the internal situation. the money and the people. you're responsible for the external situation. the streets and the getaway.
that's my responsibility.
that's your domain.
ok.
now. one thing we need to discuss is timing. timing is absolutely crucial. what are you doing? anthony!
nothing. go ahead.
bob.
i'm paying attention. i just want to look at it for a minute.
what's your fucking problem? you're a shithead!
i just want to see how much bullets it takes.
anthony, give me the fucking gun!
no, dignan. it's not your gun. it's all of ours.
i paid for it.
god dammit.
dignan, calm down.
you're out! i'm not working with either one of you!
dignan! stop!
calm down. take a deep breath.
you're right. you're right.
he doesn't get it. held never understand what we're trying to accomplish here. it's too dangerous for him.
well, in reality it's not that dangerous, bob. it's only dangerous if you don't know what you're doing.
yeah, but what if some nut pulled gun on you?
you know, bob, anthony did kill someone. he electrocuted our janitor senior year.
he electrocuted someone?
it was an accidental. i don't want to go into the details. it was just one of those senior pranks that didn't really go right. i mean, obviously, since swifty's dead. that's why anthony never graduated.
his name was swifty?
yeah. one of the nicest old guys you'd ever know.
that's too bad.
you know, when somebody gets electrocuted, their skin starts smoking. at least swifty's did.
what are you doing?
i'm putting a piece of tape on my nose.
we're closed, sir.
where's that guy going?
he left his sweater.
well, i left some money in there.
where?
in the cash register. step away from the door.
where's the manager?
where's the other stocker?
there's another stocker, right?
we know there's another stocker.
where is he? where is rob?
i don't know. maybe in literature. that's his section.
you got that?
is that the manager?
unlock that door.  check the aisles.
what happened?
shhh. slow down, bob. drive natural.
this is natural.
that's good. keep it at forty.
did we get it?
be cool, bob. be cool.  make that light.
holy shit.
we got it. we got it.
how much is there?
don't count it.
was dignan screaming like, get me a bag!
no. i was calm.
what about what that guy said?
oh, shit. that was scary. in the middle of the robbery. the manager looks at me. right in the eye. and goes, i'm going to remember you.
are you serious?
yeah. he said that.
i swear to god. in a very quiet voice.
like he meant it.
yeah.
like he would find dignan. one day.
like i'm going to hunt you down and kill you.
you really think he'll remember you?
no. all he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
see you.
see you, bob.
what's wrong with him?
what do you think?
anthony, he sat in the car and watched a 4-11 in progress. he got what he deserved.
he was the driver, dignan. he did what he's supposed to do.
i didn't realize you were so sensitive to bob's feelings. considering i did the plans, you're actually lucky you got --
don't even say it, man.
bob, will you please listen?
i don't want to talk about it.
i mean, jesus christ, bob. you didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "i'm going to remember you!"
that's true. that would give me nightmares.
bob, i've got nightmares.
you'll probably have them the rest of your life.
what was that?
how long do you have to go?
26 weeks.
and what does that cover?
social issues. crime prevention.
hand to hand combat?
ground defense.
did you hear that?
what the fuck is dignan doing with that cop? he loves them.
there's a million places to hide around here.
oh, yeah. they'll never catch the guy.
i hope not.
phil probably provoked him.  where's he going?
where you going?
move.
way to go, bob!
i told you they were there.
so it's my fault?
in all probability nothing would of happened. but why take the chance? that's why i ran. i mean how many plants were even back there? five? ten?
there were more than that.
why don't you just tell them the truth. those belong to my neighbor phil.
i don't know. i personally don't need that shit in my life right now.
nobody does.
can i get that credit card from you?
i don't like to use that credit card, dignan.
why not?
because my mom gets the bill.
she's not going to notice, anthony.
i don't want to use it.
well, then cut it in half.
i keep it for emergencies.
anthony, we're on the run. this is an emergency. it's only fair that...
see if mine are in there.
dignan, those aren't running shoes.
yes, they are.
look at the treads on those.
what about them?
they obviously weren't designed for racing.
well, those treads stink. you'd blow a knee out racing on those.
will you guys shut up? god. it's like having two little kids in the car.
ok, dad.
really. ok, dad. but seriously, anthony. these are fast shoes.
you've never had a pair of fast shoes in your life, dignan.  in fifth grade dignan used to wear cowboy boots for p.e.
that's real cool, anthony. yeah, i wore boots. my parents wouldn't buy me any $200 running shoes like yours. i wasn't spoiled.
don't call me spoiled, dignan.
you were spoiled rotten.
i'll just say it.
i'll say it.
ok. go ahead.
on your marks...  get set go.
you owe me fifty bucks.
bob?
look, man. she didn't know anything about shirts.
no, i'm not saying her. i'm just saying, i don't know.
it's a great shirt. don't worry about it.
armored trucks are very difficult to steal, anthony.
i know. but once you get inside you're home free.
right. get back to me on that one. once your plan is worth a shit.
it's not a plan. it's just --
actually. if you knew the exact route, you could plant explosives under a manhole cover and blow it up as it went over.
yeah, but you wouldn't have the truck if you blew it up.
true.
shit, bob. what the fuck did you do that for?
he wouldn't move.
is he chasing us?
i don't know.
you think he got my license plates?
he looked too shaken-up.
i'm sure he did. we'll have to get new plates.
it's registered in my mother's name.
what the fuck possessed you?
you're the one who kept saying ram him.
dignan, i can't get my hair cut. that's just not possible, all right?
then you're going to have to dye it, anthony. we've got to hide our identities. especially after bob crashed the car.
no, dignan. i'm sorry. i can't do that.
even if it's the difference between some trooper recognizing us and throwing us in prison or not?
bob. are you coming?
see you in a little while.
how do you say nineteen?
dies y nueve.
right. yeah. yo soy dies y nueve. how old are you?
are you ever scared of finding a dead body in one of these rooms?
no.
it could happen. this is the exact kind of place where it happens. but i don't want to scare you.
were you born in mexico?
cuba.
oh, really? that's interesting. do you prefer cuba or the united states?
you can go first, bob.
my brother's in jail.
what are you talking about?
the weed.
but it's not his. how can they arrest future man?
they said he's a drug dealer.
i don't think they can make it stick, bob. i mean, what do they actually have on future man?
well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
that could be anybody's.
they also found my two beam scale in the garage.
since when is it a crime to have a scale in your house? everybody has a scale.
the cops say it's a special kind of scale drug dealers use in selling marijuana.
so tell them the truth. what do you use it for?
i was just going to use it to see how much i had.
how long has he been in there?
i don't know.
then how come they haven't set the bail yet? that's unconstitutional.
we'll have to see when we get back.
what do you mean get back?
well, obviously, we got to go back.
bob, that makes no sense.
dignan, he's my brother. i can't just leave him there.
this could be a trap.
come on, dignan.
don't "come on, dignan" me.
i'm going back.
not in that car you're not.
watch me.
good luck, since i got the keys.
give me the keys, dignan.
i can't do that, bob.
dignan. you're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
don't threaten me, bob.
goddammit, dignan! it's my car! if you don't give me my keys, i swear to god --
future man would never go to jail for you, i'll tell you that.
his name's not future man, dignan.
i know it's not.
you don't even know his name.
yes, i do.
what is it?
just get in the car, bob.
what's his name?
ok, bob. i don't know his name. you know why? because i don't care. he's future man. but i care about you. and to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. will you get in the car, bob? this is stupid.
it's not your decision and he's not your brother, dignan.
that's right. i only have one vote. we'll go talk with anthony and figure it out.
you've got a beautiful walk, bob.
let's go.
i thought you guys went to get your hair cut.
no. we didn't.
this is inez. carmen. anita.
hi.
inez, this is --
jerry.  and this is my associate cornelius.
may i have a word with you, please?
sure.
what the fuck is going on here?
what. what's the matter?
anthony, we're on the run from the law here. did you tell these people your real name?
no. i didn't. dignan, they don't speak english.
they don't?
no. not really. inez speaks a little.
which one was that?
on the left.
she's from cuba.
no kidding.
dignan.
anthony. bad news.
how long are they going to hold him?
i don't know. i don't know anything. except phil says they got him. and he's in jail.
he needs to hire an attorney.
no, no. look. ok. let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
anthony, i --
and if future man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. all right?
now that makes sense. we'll hang out for a couple of days. get a little r&r. make sure future man's ok and then get back on the road.
as long as he gets out ok.
obviously. that's a given.
bob?
what?
is that ok?
see, now we've got a plan.
don't worry about it, bob.
does my skin feel soft, anthony?
god, yes. like silk.
what?  what?
like silk?
god. that does sound corny. oh, your skin feels so soft and silky. but it really kind of does.
see, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor mr. langston's house and anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. i had to dive in and save him.
this was in fourth grade.
mr. langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. cpr. i've never said this before, but frankly i thought anthony was dead. the veins in his face were all sticking out. his skin was blue. he truly did look dead.
after that my parents never let me go to dignan's again.
they blamed my family for everything. they always said mr. langston saved anthony's life.
but if it wasn't for dignan i probably would of died.
yes... it's true.
he's gone. he stole the car.
where was it parked?
right here.
that coward. son of a bitch.
maybe he just went to the store.
he took his stuff. he's gone.  i should of seen this. i should of expected it. bob doesn't have any character.
he went back for his brother.
we said 48 hours.
that's a long time to be in jail.
when'd he tell you?
this morning.
where was i?
you were asleep.
he told you and you let him do it.
he told me because he wanted to know if i wanted to go.
if you wanted to go? what were you going to do? just leave me here by myself?
well, i didn't do it, did i?
so when you were saying bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. you were just --
bob went to help his brother. i understand that and i can't help it if you don't.
i understand that if i had a few more friends like you and bob i'd be dead.
if you say so.
if you'd gone with bob you'd probably be in weatherford by now. of course i'd be here frantically worrying thinking you must of got kidnapped.
i didn't realize you had such an incredible ability to feel sorry for yourself, dignan.
well, the world is a little bit colder today.
we're going over to this bar if you feel like going.
no. i'm going to swim. i'll see you later.
why don't you come with us.
ok.
hello, my friend. you in the army, yes?
no. i just have short hair.
is that your chiquita?
no, my friend knows her.
she chicano, yes?
you like chicanos?
sure.
you a good pool player.
got a little lucky.
where's your friend? he go with the chiquita?
i don't know.
she is a good looking woman.
guess i'll get another tecate.
si. tecate. you like to fight?
what?
fight. you know.
no. just pool.
you hoto?
fuck you. you a hoto.
no. me no hoto. tecate?
right.
i can't believe he just jumped you.
can you hand me those french fries.
i wish i'd been there.
would of been nice.
man. i'm sorry. we just went for a walk --
i don't really feel like talking about it. the only thing i feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
we need a car.
i have an idea for that.
what?
inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  doesn't she?
i don't think we can do that.
i know we can. it's real simple. we go into a room, grab some car keys and --
what i'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
she doesn't need to know.
i don't know, dignan. i just --
look. i'm ready to get the fuck out of here. it's real torture for me to be here. getting the shit kicked out of me by mexicans.
shh.
no one to back me up. now i have a good idea. so unless you come up with something better --
dignan. i can't do that. all right? i just can't.
i don't think we need any keys, dignan. i think i can hotwire a car for us.
you don't know how to hotwire.
yes, i do. bob taught me.
bob taught you how to get electrocuted.
no, i'm serious. he made me a diagram.
i think we better go home.
don't panic, anthony.
i'm not. but there's --
you can't just run home every time things get tough. first of all, we've got enough dough to --
our money situation is not good.
you're so spoiled. what is "not good" to you? only a few hundred --
we've got sixteen dollars.
that's not correct.
sixteen dollars.
i know.
where's the rest?
i had to give some to inez.
how much?
$383.
you gave $383 to the goddamn housekeeper! what the fuck is your problem?
she needed it.
a $500 tip! for the housekeeper!
her name's inez. stop calling her the housekeeper.
that's what she is!
i know that. but --
you're in love with the fucking housekeeper!
shut up!
what are you going to do, get married? have a bunch of little idiot janitor brats! and go around scrubbing the --
bob, where you going?
i'm not playing any more golf.
why not?
cause i'm not getting any better. it's a waste of time.
you've only been playing for two weeks, bob. it takes a long time to learn this game.
you think i'm improving?
yes. you just got to stick with it.
you don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
no, i don't mind.
i know it must of been a bad experience. but it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
well, i didn't mean to electrocute him. but the whole operation was my idea.
it took six months of research. i did all the wiring myself. switched ac to dc. doubled the voltage. shorted out the generator. the whole school was shut down.
that's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
i don't like that word prank, bob. i was trying to do something more than a prank.
at first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. that's partly why i was in custody so long. sixty days.
sixty days?
yeah. one minute you're studying great expectations and the next minute you're drawing the holy mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
why were you drawing the holy mary?
prison tatoos. i got to be pretty good. it's not like drawing on paper.
how's that 700 bucks coming?
i'm working on it.
hard to find it sitting by the pool drinking beer and bullshitting.
i thought he didn't have to pay anything because of the technicality.
yeah, but he still has the aggravation. three days sitting in a cell.
were you adopted, bob?
why do you say that?
well, because you guys don't look alike.
no. i wasn't adopted.
was future man adopted?
jesus christ! no.
there's a lot of valuable shit in there, applejack. the silver and the china. the crystal. and the grandfather clock. goddammit, i bet that clock's worth ten grand.
why the fuck do we need to blow up the car? it doesn't make any goddamn sense.
just settling an old score. you might say revenge.
that sounds like a lot of bullshit that'll land us in jail.
we might have to take that chance. cause i feel pretty strongly about this.
is that buckethead?
is that him?
wait a second.
that's anthony.
that's your friend anthony?
yeah.
what's he doing here?
looks like he's staying with buckethead. that's what i figured. he's probably got his own room. let's see where he's going.
wait. did he see us?
we're going too slow. it looks like we're following him.
when'd you get back?
ah. couple days ago.
who's in the car?
that's applejack. you want to meet him?
sure.
nice to meet you, applejack.
you're anthony?
yeah.
i hear you're a good thief.
applejack would of got him anyway. this was just the quicker way.
you really hit a guy with a bottle?
i want you to look at this.
what is it?
it's big, anthony. real big. it's called hinckley cold storage.
what's hinckley cold storage?
mr. henry has an inside source. we call him steve. that's where we get our information.
who's mr. henry?
you'll meet him this afternoon. he's helping us set it up.
did you ever hear of the s. cooper trust robbery?
uh-uh.
s. cooper trust, in san francisco?
uh-uh.
mr. henry pulled that job in 1965. it's famous. applejack was the wheel man. did you use this same car, applejack?
hell, no. this is a '72. i was driving a '63 pontiac.
what exactly is this place? freezers?
right. freezers. imported foods.
let's go, abdul-shabazz.
abdul-shabazz?
what time did he say to be here?
right now.
i can knock a man out with a six inch punch.
what do you mean?
feel this.
you could give somebody a concussion.
let me feel that.
how's the weather down there?
mr. henry?
come on in!
it's locked.
no, it's not.
dignan. good to see you. good to see you applejack.  who are you?
this is anthony adams, mr. henry.
this is no good.
this is my business manager, rowboat.
nice to meet you.
that's a sharp jacket.
thanks.
it's hard to get much spin with this kind of paddle.
it's called a racquet, anthony, and you're holding it wrong. that's ghetto play. hold it like this.
you know, your form is for shit, but you've got a hell of a talent.
thanks.
is he in?
i don't know. are you in, anthony?
every once in a while some cat comes to me. he wants to know how i made it. how did i become a success?  the first thing i tell them is: follow your instincts. let your instincts guide you. the second thing i tell them is, for christ's sake: you got to know your grammar.
grammar.
what do you mean grammar?
the basic grammatical rules of robbing.
you mean like techniques?
technique. that's right. seventy- five percent of your job is crowd control. seventy-five percent. do you believe that?
i'd like to live in that place. hinckley cold storage.
yeah. convert it into lofts. ok. pop quiz. what's the single most important aspect of your job?
the grammar?
crowd control. crowd control. wake up, guys.
oh, yeah.
you're going to need a boxman for this one. but that can be arranged.
you mean a safecracker?
yeah. and i'll tell you who we're going to want: kumar banijamali.
is he good?
he's damn good.
what do you think?
he seems pretty good.
hey, dignan. how's it going?
not bad.
come on in. what you been up to?
not a whole lot, bob.
it's too bad about what happened on the road.
yeah. it is.
let's not even talk about it.
it was stupid.
right. it was extremely stupid.
i don't expect an apology and i don't even want one. i just want us to --
i can't fucking believe this guy. an apology, bob?
man, i don't want to go into this.
yeah. let's keep it --
cause you would of let my brother rot in jail.
you said 48 hours!
i never agreed to that.
bob, you're lying!
bullshit.
all right! backyard! right now!
dignan. take it easy.
bob!
he doesn't want to fight.
get out of the way.
no, dignan. this isn't --
come on!
i don't want to fight you, dignan.
no fighting. it wasn't bob's fault.
easy, dignan. it's ok.
it wasn't your fault, bob. you had your brother.
i didn't have any choice.
i'm sorry, bob.
that's ok.
shit, dignan.
what the fuck are we doing out here?
i don't know, dignan. you went crazy.
i'm sorry, bob.
that's ok.
look. we want you on the job.
how you doing, bob?
hey, jackson. how's it going?
you keeping out of trouble?
i'm trying.
this boy's a troublemaker. he used to tear this place apart.
your brother was up here the other day. he said you ran away from home.
he said what?
he said you ran away from home.
no. i didn't run away. i went out of town.
fancy seeing you here, bob.
yeah. hey, clay.
john mapplethorpe.  how are you. hi.
good to know you, john.
i might have mentioned it.
john, i'm twenty-six years old i didn't run away from home.
i know, bob. you were on a secret mission.
i'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
right. i'm sorry.  you've got a reputation to think about.
the world needs dreamers, son.
what?
the world needs dreamers. to relieve the pain of consciousness.
well, we'll see you later, bob.
pleasure to meet you, john.
nice to meet you.
ok. man in blue jeans just left by southwest door. he is entering a white van. what time is it?
eleven fifteen.
ok. mark that down.
i did.
god. isn't this great? working on the job. got a wheel man. got a safecracker. good friends with mr. henry.
yeah. it's pretty good.
it's like we've finally arrived.
look at that woman. she's what? fifty? fifty-five? but she hasn't let herself go. i appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
so do i.
tell me something. what the hell kind of name is dignan?
i'm not really sure. i think it's irish. or maybe --
i guess what i'm trying to say is what the hell kind of person is this dignan?
what do you mean what kind of person? he's a good person.
sure, sure. he's a great person, and i'd call bullshit on anybody who said differently. but i wonder if the kid has the goods  up here.
i don't think you're giving him enough credit. i know sometimes he doesn't think an idea through. he gets too excited. but --
as far as i can tell he hasn't thought his life through. he'd be fine cutting my grass or parking my car. but business?  you i can work with. you i could groom. dignan's not going to make it.
and you're wrong if you think, i'd turn my back on a friend.
hold it.
congratulations. you passed the test.
what do you mean?
the abe henry double-cross test. you just made a perfect score.
that was a test?
take a deep breath.
how does that feel?
it feels good.
did dignan take the test?
yes, he did.
how'd he do?
well, he agreed 100% that bob should be dropped. and he also agreed you were a liability. but he felt his talent would make up for your weaknesses.
that sounds like dignan.
i don't know why the fuck we're having a party. the damn job's not over yet.
well, this isn't really a party per se.
you don't celebrate til it's over.
true.
i'll tell you, anthony. times like this i get philosophical. what does it mean? what's it all about? are you afraid to die?
me?
no, that door over there.
i don't want to die.
are you afraid?
yeah. i mean, i don't think about it all the time. but once in awhile i kind of go, woah. man.
exactly. woah.
death.
the fear of death, the pain of consciousness.  did you mix this martini?
no. bob did.
bob. bob. that's a palindrome.  i love palindromes.
are you afraid to die, mr. henry?
anthony, i'm petrified.
come on, bob.
i know it, man. hang on.
jesus christ.
give him a second.
hopscotch. the code name is hopscotch.
join the party, fellas.
we're just going over a few things.
you got to have fun with it. there's no point if you're not having any fun. would you like me to be there tomorrow?
yes.
why?
well, i think --
no, if i go out on this job, then it's just another score by mr. henry. and i don't see it like that. this is your job. your creation. i want you to try this.
this is good.
i want to ask a favor, boys. one day, when i'm long gone and all but forgotten, make one last toast to abe henry. and remember me as a friend.
but you're thieves. it's what you are.
yeah.
it's an esoteric journey.
we're renegades from despair.
can i ask you something, mr. henry?
absolutely.
why'd you want to help us?
because i was like you once. and there was no one there to help me.
next week we'll be drinking piña coladas.
hopefully this trip'll go a little smoother than the last one.
or i might end up with a broken nose.
did that hurt?
i'll try not to hold you back tomorrow.
i don't think you will.
i don't want to be too much of a liability.
look, you're going to do fine. it's ok to be scared.
i don't think i ever said this to you. but it meant a lot to me the way you were after that swifty stuff happened.
he was a nice guy.
he was all right.
do you like inez?
as a person?
yeah. as a girl.
yes. i do.
so do i.
you ok, bob?
no, i'm having a heart attack. of course, i'm ok. what's that supposed to mean?
nothing. i was just asking.
no, i know. i'm just saying. i feel fine. you want a piece of cake?
sure.
bird dog to scarecrow. bird dog to scarecrow.
go ahead, bird dog.
you're all clear.
roger.
we all set?
hang on a second.
scarecrow?
yeah?
everything ok?
yeah. we're in the elevator. how's it look back there?
it looks pretty good. there's nobody back here.
stand by. bird dog?
uh-huh?
take your second position.
ok. roger.
where did he go?
who? applejack?
why did he go that way?
he's going to watch the back stairwell, remember?  don't worry about it.
i'm in position, scarecrow.
any activity?
not at all. the place is totally deserted.
good. it's supposed to be.
i've got a great view up here. i can see all the --
stand by, bird dog.
i don't know.
check the fucking elevator. it's moving.
what are you doing?
my walkie talkie's busted. i can't tell what's going on.
let me see it.  did you drop it?
no.
what's happening? what's going on?
it was bob. his walkie talkie's busted.
i couldn't hear anything.
who's watching the door? what the fuck are you doing? get back in position.
who did that? what the fuck is that?
it's going back down.
applejack! what's happening?
what?
bob! get back in position!
where'd they come from?
the front stairs.
where were you?
what's the story?
can't get it. it won't...
what can we do?
freeze!
nobody move!
get against the wall!
jesus, bob.
i didn't do anything.
what's wrong with applejack?
he's having a heart attack or something.
let's go!
help me move him.
careful. check his pulse.
is he breathing?
i think so.
jesus christ. what the fuck is that?
i didn't think there was an alarm.
take him to the car, bob.
who tripped the alarm?
it's the fire alarm. somebody pulled the fire alarm.
where's kumar?
i don't know.
jesus christ, anthony. did you lose him?
what are you doing?
let's go. come on.
wait for kumar.
come on, kumar.
the elevator broke.
where's applejack?
he's stuck between two floors.
you're kidding.
applejack's stuck in the elevator?
yeah.
who's got the car keys?
applejack drove.
run. run. let's go.
come on.
i'll see you there.
what?
i'll see you there.
what are you talking about?
i'll get him.
there's not enough time.
yes, there is. let's get organized.
dignan, it's too late.
i don't think so.
i said to the da, that cop who hit me must of given me crs disease.
what's that?
that's just what the da asked. crs is a disease where you can't remember shit.
like amnesia.
can't remember shit. crs.
so is mr. henry going to come by and see me or anything?
i don't think so. i mean. actually, he robbed bob's house.
he did?
yeah.
you got to be kidding me.
i'm not kidding.
what'd he get?
pretty much everything.
the grandfather clock?
you think applejack knew?
we haven't heard from applejack since he got out of the hospital. his case got dismissed.
why?
we're not sure.
we think mr. henry maybe --
his health isn't very good, you know. they take that into account.
mr. henry never gave you a test, did he?
what do you mean?
nothing.
you're living on a sailboat?
it belongs to bob's uncle.
how big is it?
oh, i'd say about --
it's in the driveway.
temporarily.
where?
behind bob's house.
does it float?
we're not sure yet. it's going to need some repairs.
so how is it in there?
what can i say? it's jail. you don't sleep when you want to. you don't eat when you want to.
do you have your own room?
we don't have rooms, bob. we have cells.
do you have your own cell?
no. i have a cellmate. his name's carl.
what's he in for?
he stole a tractor.
do they let you --
i don't really want to talk about it, bob.
i think i may have found a way out of here.
you're kidding.
no. i'm not.
how?
shhh. wait for my instructions.
dignan, i --
when we go through the next gate you'll have 30 seconds to take out the tower guard.
what?
have the car running at the north- west checkpoint. bob and i'll --
dignan, i --
scale the barricade and tunnel through no man's land. and bob. remember:
scale the --
shield me from the bullets. they won't shoot civilians. ready?
hold on --
here we go.
wait a second --
now!
