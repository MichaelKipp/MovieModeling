yeah. so who the fuck does?
come on. tell us, shitface.
you fellas got names?
lansky. meyer lansky. and that's bugsy siegel ya got there.
how much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
long as charlie says.
when the stiff's an irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
can't we get a couple whores over?
you ain't even a man yet.
that ain't what your mama said.
where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
ya ignorant guinea, it's kreplach.
four-twenty-eight.
what's that divided four ways?
a hundred-seven bucks too much. any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to moliari.
ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
they told me you wanted to talk about this shane business.
you havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
shane was a friend of yours?
he was around...
lad, i'm a busy man. july's always a big month for murder. fella named barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  black hand.
when you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
it consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. we try to oblige.
but if ya can't catch the guys...
tommy reina. good pal. better partner.
from your mouth ta god's ear.
he's got a line on the good stuff.
no disrespect, tommy, but why would mr. arnold rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
we could lose the deal!
if we have to.
so chicago's been good to ya.
i do right by johnny torrio and he does right by me.
ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
and a lot more. can we talk?
sure. what's with the brick wall?
since colosimo bit it, i gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
one fuckin' year ago i had ta hit you up for train fare. now i can buy the fuckin' train. and i ain't even a fuckin' sicilian!
but ya got a boss.
torrio ain't like them guys. he thinks like an american. you'd like him, charlie. he'd like you.
maybe. but he'd still be the boss.
when my money moves, i go with it.
i trust mr. johnson filled you in on the revisions.
scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
mr. rothstein, can i be frank? you're a gambler, and i know you've had losses. i also know you could sell to maranzano or masseria for fifty g's, but nobody sells to those guys once. so if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, i ain't gonna beef.
i ain't mad. i ain't even surprised. but i can't let ya fuck me. on the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, i'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
could we step outside?
i got my partner in there!
i cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in sicily.
precisely. we are the true entrepreneurs, and prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. america is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of little italy.
we'll start small. when we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. only sell the best stuff. and keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
an intelligent plan, mr. luciano, but listen to me well. it can be ruined in a single careless moment. keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
don't worry. i got friends to take care of that.
meyer just finished the books.
a million bucks. in the last six months.
i'm bobby clowes. kansas city.
charlie luciano.
you ever been near a meat packing plant? my father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. nothin' you can do.
the goddamned bastards.
tell me about it.
i remember reading a poem in college. "sicily. poor, noble isle...".
poor, yeah.
but not you.
don maranzano. welcome.
i've heard so much about this club of yours. i had to come and see.
good liquor draws a good crowd.
i must know more of you, my son.
not a lot ta know.
then perhaps you need to know me.
don, i'd be honored.
know somethin'? this stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
shuddup.
wanna know what i think?
spare us.
i think these rich shits -- no offense bobby -- are so dead below the waist that they gotta ride around all day swingin' at each other ta get their broads hot.
inside, they were talking of you.
i can just imagine.
no. they envy you.
for being a bootlegger?
for being a man.
salvatore. my young caesar. first me, sallie. then you.
the name's charlie.
mussolini is raping sicily like every roman before him. so our brothers are coming to america. soldiers willing to fight and die. men who know the meaning of honor.
don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
and how many soldiers do you have?
i've got friends.
i have six hundred. soldiers. and more every week off the boat.
an' masseria's got seven hundred.
he's an animal!
he's the boss of all the bosses, and i respect him.
the internal revenue came to my offices. i turned over all my ledgers. they found nothing. charlie, i am a businessman.
sittin' around gives me the piles. you got a proposition?
we combine everything. you are my second in command.
what about the share.
you get fifteen percent.
i got partners.
your calabrian friend, i will accept. at least costello eats pasta like us.
and the jews?
share with them as you wish. do business with them on your own. but no filthy jew will ever be a brother to me.
those fucks can't leave each other alone. maranzano and masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
let 'em kill each other off! why should we care?
there won't be any way to stay out of it.
i think maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
sure, frankie. fuck me. fuck meyer. fuck arnold rothstein who's made us all rich. all so you can be an fuckin' honorary sicilian!
does maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
if he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
bugsy, you and i don't need to be in business with maranzano. we got more jobs than we can handle. that's not the problem.
so what is the problem?
the minute we sell out to maranzano, that bastard is gonna have you knocked off.
the deal's too good, frankie
what are ya thinkin', charlie?
if ever i need a boss, joe.
yeah. yeah. i bet ya feed maranzano that same line.
i like that.
whatta ya mean, boss?
ya piss like a man.
well...
mr. costello handles our business with the government agencies.
that's it.
where's the stiff?
come on. be polite.
sorry, charlie. i gotta get my johnson worked tonight.
jesus.
hell. it's been four days!
you here with bobby?
no. i'm here with you.
are you frightened?
why should i be?
i had everything. once.
so what happened?
life knocked me back.
i came into this world flat on my ass.
and now you have everything.
no. not everything.
up down. down up. it's the same. you see things through both eyes.
i guess i am. just a little.
what do you mean?
scared.
what's the matter?
i must be going.
come on. it's christmas. at least stay for breakfast.
i'm already late.
for what?
why didn't you tell me that maranzano had made you an offer?
i turned him down flat.
and if i had known, i would have warned you to expect this. we could have prepared.
masseria's been after me too.
thank you for keeping me informed.
we were overdue to get hit.
you think this is a coincidence? next week half your customers will be buying their scotch, our scotch, from maranzano. in a month, he'll be in scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. i'll be out of business, and you'll be working for maranzano.
we can operate around these guys.
not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
okay. i'm listening.
a hundred years ago austria was run by a prince named metternich. austria was weak, and it's neighbors were strong. but they were ruled by passionate men, while metternich was ruthless and brilliant. if one country got too strong, he rallied an alliance against it. he would lead all of europe to the brink of war, then bring the enemies together and forge the peace.
forget it.
fuck 'em.
we'll figure out something.
i'm supposed to be at my old man's for christmas dinner at eight.
come off it, bugs.
come off it, bugs.
ben-jamin.
johnson's still on board. even maranzano won't screw with nucky in atlantic city. but everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
i'll knock 'em in, charlie. i can do it. blow his fuckin' head off. get rid of the bastard for good.
you wouldn't live out the week.
we got exactly two choices, maranzano or masseria.
they don't give a shit about us!
masseria's scared. he might make our deal.
we can't sell out to those guys. they ain't businessmen!
but maranzano's got the men and the brains.
which is why he doesn't need us.
at least masseria plays by the rules. maranzano thinks he's god, and the rules don't apply.
without us, masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
i'm sorry, but i sleep better when i know i'm with the winning side.
we're gonna be the winning side. it's like rothstein said about that guy in austria. we're gonna use maranzano and masseria. let 'em knock each other bloody. and then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. what they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
i thought we just wanted to be left alone to run our business.
so we're gonna knock 'em both off?
if it comes to that. yeah.
luciano.
i was calling yesterday.
something came up.
i needed to see you again.
same here.
you're sure?
why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
it's a mask.
you got something to hide?
it's too late.
have you thought about this?
why? you're the innocent one.
guess i'm too confused to think.
i'm glad ya come.
what's with the banquet? this is supposed to be a private meet.
it's only us and sonny. hey, sonny. come on out.
you boys carryin' pieces?
you tryin' ta tell me something? i don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
see if these two are my friends.
you're a smart boy, charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. a man needs a family.
i know. when the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
i got a place for you. in my family... or in the cemetery.
never threaten me, boss.
this business is about taking risks.
calculated risks. but boss, this one don't calculate.
meyer.
it's nothin'. i'm gettin' married.
married? to anna?  you ain't got her in trouble?
no. we ain't even...
well, good. woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
guess i'm not a single type guy.
whatta ya mean? it's great!
we're going to atlantic city for the honeymoon.
i'll talk to nucky. get you set up like the fuckin' prince of wales.
i been thinkin'...
good. 'cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
we need to put together a meet for the whole country. we all got the same problems. we could talk. meet the guys we don't know. lift a few with the guys we do.
like a party for all our friends.
italians, jews, irish. one big party. course, some guys don't get along.
like don maranzano.
and if we don't invite maranzano, we can't invite masseria. guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
i'll handle the boss.
so we end up with everybody but the two bosses, at our meet. we ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
how soon can we pull this off?
i'm gettin' married in six weeks. i'll already be in atlantic city which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
your honeymoon, meyer?
might as well put the time to use.
you could have stopped him.
ya never tell a guy about a broad.
so you all make the same mistakes?
gives us something in common.
tommy tells me that capone's coming in from chicago.
he's trying to make it.
he'll think something's wrong i ain't there.
he'll know you were smart enough to stay away, boss.
what the fuck does that mean?
you know that if you come, we gotta invite maranzano.
so fuck him. i don't care anymore. let him come.
so he can talk to all the families behind your back? maybe have his own meet at 3:00 am under the goddamn boardwalk? no. you're too smart for a sucker play.
there seems to be some confusion about your registration. i believe i can find you a place at the ambassador. many persons of the jewish faith find it quite...
i ain't no fuckin' kike!
i'm sorry, sir. our clientele is restricted to white anglo-saxons.
and i ain't no nigger either!
sir, we do not use such names at our hotel.
you own a hotel, sir?
the bismark in chicago. you familiar?
we have a commission. if there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides.
tell me something, meyer. how can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
the commission don't decide how i spend my honeymoon.
hey, i ignore my wife too. but on our honeymoon i paid attention.
boo-boo.
not another word.
what you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. ya know, if i keep on killin' people like i have, i won't have no more friends left!
you've got the public upset, al.
but you know i never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
when the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
what are ya tellin' me, charlie?
we're asking you to go to prison.
but i've never served a day.
if it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. we got friends in philly. they can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge.
awwh, charlie.
minimum security. you'll have everything but broads.
where we headed?
wassa matter, mr. big shot. don't have time for my business no more?
boss, i got all the time you need.
i know about you.
and what went on your little party in atlantic city. i got ears.
that little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
money don't mean shit!
didn't know you felt that way.
you and vito are gonna pull that payroll job. right now.
you gotta plan these things.
and i got it all planned.
bastard didn't even show.
he's hidin'. word's out tommy reina's goin' over ta maranzano.
get word to maranzano. i want a meet. alone. on neutral turf.
after all this time i'd think you'd know me better, meyer.
it's not myself i'm worried about.
i'll do fine.
maranzano wants you dead.
yeah. but he needs me alive.
strategy.
talk english. okay? i did lousy at school.
the big picture.
that's just what i'm sick of. everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! greedy for what you got. a bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
so change it.
bring order out of chaos. if you lead... they'll follow.
and what do you want out of this?
a peaceful and prosperous retirement.
tell me, my son. why did you go with giuseppe? he's not our kind.
i found that out.
we learn from life.
that's why i'm here.
coming with me will be a delicate matter. we will work it out. but charlie...
conditions have changed. some people have become too powerful.
i'll take care of the boss.
if you give him the chance, lansky will betray you like judas.
i don't fuck my partners.
no worry, charlie. i will kill them for you. no one will know.
at first, it will hurt you. but you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
you're fuckin' crazy. you're all fuckin' crazy!
i booked passage to london.
london?
my friends have a country house we can use for a while.
if i look weak now, it's over.
i'm very sorry... i didn't...
oh, god. don't start actin' like a fuckin' wife on me.
you're getting' 10 cc's
i told you twenty!
you bastards, i said twenty!
it'll just be a few minutes.
i need the twenty!
everybody's talkin' about ya, charlie. first time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
guess i'm just lucky.
that's just what they're calling ya pal. lucky luciano.
masseria's confused. he can't figure whether you're workin' for maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. so he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after profaci because it happened on his turf. i figure masseria's gonna try to rub out profaci, and pin it on us. then maranzano will have to kill ya.
you got men on profaci's place?
we got our boys paintin' the house next door. around the clock. we're gonna keep old man profaci alive if it takes twenty coats.
tommy reina's gone over to maranzano, but so far masseria ain't lifted a finger,
the fat man's scared. scared of us, and scared without us. same with maranzano. we gotta get their minds back on each other. this fuckin' peace is killin' us.
we can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
who?
tommy reina.
what you mean? tommy ain't done nothin'.
maranzano will think masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
why's it gotta be tommy!
masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. and as long as we keep the boss alive, maranzano can't win without you.
i'm a hard guy. i done more jobs than alla you combined. and i never said no. not once. but dammit i don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
because the world ain't big enough for the dons. so we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. it ain't the way i'd make the world, but that's the way it is.
we're gonna change it, bugs. once we get rid of the dons, the commission's gonna rule. no more wars. no more vendettas. no more boss of all the bosses.
yeah. and no more tommy reina.
masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. but his patience won't hold out much longer.
how's bugsy doin'?
tommy reina's hauntin' his dreams. but he'll do his job.
a lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. i'm sorry you got hit by it.
you must be feeling better, if you're looking for sex again.
would it be painful for you?
it always is.
jeez, bugsy. ya like ta scared the crap outta me.
just wanted ta say hello.
know something tommy? you're a mensch.
that a jew compliment?
best we got.
awww... deep down i'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
guess so. ya got a minute? i got somethin' for ya.
take any one ya like.
kinda early for christmas, bugs.
a jew's gotta let his heart tell him when ta give his presents.
you're fuckin' crazy.
but only on purpose, tommy.
this is nice. i mean it.
if i wanted ta kill ya, i woulda done it long ago. it's not like you ain't given me reason.
i'm still the boss of all the bosses! and you'll do what i say!
so tell me when i ain't done it.
how can i trust you when you look at me like that?
you got no fuckin' choice. you might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
tell me, charlie. please.
why should i go against you, boss? nobody can handle this business like you. maranzano'll never know the crap that you forget. he's got no business bein' boss. the idea makes me wanna puke. you're the boss, an it's gonna stay that way.
even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
they do what i tell 'em.
salvatore. always holding himself above.
you and me both. sal-va-to-re.
we must be friends, charlie.
keep my terms and i won't be your enemy.
the terms will be mine.
the guy doin' the job names the price. if you don't like it, you can kill masseria yourself.
i will be the boss of all bosses.
what makes you think i give a damn about that sicilian crap?
tell it to the calabrian. tell it to the jews.
you disrespect our tradition.
boss, we got our own tradition. we call it treatin' your friends right, and not bein' a pig for every scrap of glory.
charlie!
i do this for you, and you'll leave me and my guys alone. be the fuckin' boss of all the other bosses, but we are gonna be our own bosses.
forget it. that's past.
no matter what you say to me salvatore, you are my bambino.
what are ya thinkin'?
joe profaci. carlo gambino. vinnie mangano. joe bananas. they all gotta die.
you can't fuck with them. they're heads of families!
they're friends of our enemy.
take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
not if they all die at once.
every successor will owe his loyalty to us. together we take out maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
a mother-fuckin' peace conference.
we gotta talk in private. i got a friend in coney island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
but that's an hour's drive.
lobster fra diavolo. spaghetti with red clam sauce. antipasto. and pastry that'll make you wanna go home and slap your sweet mama.
ya did good. i ain't seen the boss so happy in weeks.
look at this boy. he hardly eats. like that fella killed caesar.
when ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.
the kid just called me stupid.
not stupid. fat.
shit. when i was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. right, gerardo?
sure. but ya got a deck a cards? i wanna play some klob.
come on, charlie. we got business.
couple hands. no harm in it.
one move pardner, and you're a dead man.
you can't kill me. you gave your word, charlie.
so? i'll get bugs ta do it.
mad dog coll's in town on a job.
who hired the bastard?
maranzano. ta ice you.
charlie?
i'm doin' business here!
but there's...
i'm gonna lose you, charlie.
it'll all be over tomorrow. no more wars. no more killin'. just livin' normal like everybody else.  you'll be stuck with me for good.
meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
what's your problem?
it's just that maranzano's the only bastard i ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the irs. he came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
seein' he loved the experience so much, i think we outta give him the pleasure again.
yes?
i'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
luciano is dead?
open a window. every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.
what a cozy little scene.
kill them! kill them!
what's it worth to ya, boss?
anything!
anything ain't a very hard number.
one hundred thousand. no... three hundred thousand.
now that's a hard number.
up here, boss.
that ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
but from now on it's lucky's spot.
maybe you better hear what i got to say first.
whatever you say, boss.
no, al. whatever we say. we're all bosses here. we don' need another.
come on, charlie. we gotta have a top guy. otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
as long as ya got one top boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. and that's war on top of war.
who'll make the rules?
we'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. all of us. together. we all get one vote. includin' me.
charlie, i'm from the old country, and these american ways get me sometimes confused. you tellin' us you refuse the title of boss of all the bosses?
i don't care what anybody calls me, joe. long as it ain't to dirty. and if you fellas get together every year and say, "charlie, we still want you to run things for us", i ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
julius caesar never took no vote.
and maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of rome.
why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
you scare me, charlie.
maybe that's why i'm the boss.
yeah. so who the fuck does?
come on. tell us, shitface.
you fellas got names?
lansky. meyer lansky. and that's bugsy siegel ya got there.
how much longer we gotta be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
long as charlie says.
when the stiff's an irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
can't we get a couple whores over?
you ain't even a man yet.
that ain't what your mama said.
where'd ya get this funny ravioli?
ya ignorant guinea, it's kreplach.
four-twenty-eight.
what's that divided four ways?
a hundred-seven bucks too much. any kid who drops an extra dime is gonna be talkin' to moliari.
ya mean we're so rich we're broke?
they told me you wanted to talk about this shane business.
you havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
shane was a friend of yours?
he was around...
lad, i'm a busy man. july's always a big month for murder. fella named barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  black hand.
when you're investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
it consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. we try to oblige.
but if ya can't catch the guys...
tommy reina. good pal. better partner.
from your mouth ta god's ear.
he's got a line on the good stuff.
no disrespect, tommy, but why would mr. arnold rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
why ya always gotta go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
we could lose the deal!
if we have to.
so chicago's been good to ya.
i do right by johnny torrio and he does right by me.
ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
and a lot more. can we talk?
sure. what's with the brick wall?
since colosimo bit it, i gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
one fuckin' year ago i had ta hit you up for train fare. now i can buy the fuckin' train. and i ain't even a fuckin' sicilian!
but ya got a boss.
torrio ain't like them guys. he thinks like an american. you'd like him, charlie. he'd like you.
maybe. but he'd still be the boss.
when my money moves, i go with it.
i trust mr. johnson filled you in on the revisions.
scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
mr. rothstein, can i be frank? you're a gambler, and i know you've had losses. i also know you could sell to maranzano or masseria for fifty g's, but nobody sells to those guys once. so if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, i ain't gonna beef.
i ain't mad. i ain't even surprised. but i can't let ya fuck me. on the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, i'll advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
could we step outside?
i got my partner in there!
i cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in sicily.
precisely. we are the true entrepreneurs, and prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. america is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they're still fighting over the crumbs of little italy.
we'll start small. when we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. only sell the best stuff. and keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
an intelligent plan, mr. luciano, but listen to me well. it can be ruined in a single careless moment. keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
don't worry. i got friends to take care of that.
meyer just finished the books.
a million bucks. in the last six months.
i'm bobby clowes. kansas city.
charlie luciano.
you ever been near a meat packing plant? my father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. nothin' you can do.
the goddamned bastards.
tell me about it.
i remember reading a poem in college. "sicily. poor, noble isle...".
poor, yeah.
but not you.
don maranzano. welcome.
i've heard so much about this club of yours. i had to come and see.
good liquor draws a good crowd.
i must know more of you, my son.
not a lot ta know.
then perhaps you need to know me.
don, i'd be honored.
know somethin'? this stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
shuddup.
wanna know what i think?
spare us.
i think these rich shits -- no offense bobby -- are so dead below the waist that they gotta ride around all day swingin' at each other ta get their broads hot.
inside, they were talking of you.
i can just imagine.
no. they envy you.
for being a bootlegger?
for being a man.
salvatore. my young caesar. first me, sallie. then you.
the name's charlie.
mussolini is raping sicily like every roman before him. so our brothers are coming to america. soldiers willing to fight and die. men who know the meaning of honor.
don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
and how many soldiers do you have?
i've got friends.
i have six hundred. soldiers. and more every week off the boat.
an' masseria's got seven hundred.
he's an animal!
he's the boss of all the bosses, and i respect him.
the internal revenue came to my offices. i turned over all my ledgers. they found nothing. charlie, i am a businessman.
sittin' around gives me the piles. you got a proposition?
we combine everything. you are my second in command.
what about the share.
you get fifteen percent.
i got partners.
your calabrian friend, i will accept. at least costello eats pasta like us.
and the jews?
share with them as you wish. do business with them on your own. but no filthy jew will ever be a brother to me.
those fucks can't leave each other alone. maranzano and masseria ain't gonna be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
let 'em kill each other off! why should we care?
there won't be any way to stay out of it.
i think maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
sure, frankie. fuck me. fuck meyer. fuck arnold rothstein who's made us all rich. all so you can be an fuckin' honorary sicilian!
does maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
if he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
bugsy, you and i don't need to be in business with maranzano. we got more jobs than we can handle. that's not the problem.
so what is the problem?
the minute we sell out to maranzano, that bastard is gonna have you knocked off.
the deal's too good, frankie
what are ya thinkin', charlie?
if ever i need a boss, joe.
yeah. yeah. i bet ya feed maranzano that same line.
i like that.
whatta ya mean, boss?
ya piss like a man.
well...
mr. costello handles our business with the government agencies.
that's it.
where's the stiff?
come on. be polite.
sorry, charlie. i gotta get my johnson worked tonight.
jesus.
hell. it's been four days!
you here with bobby?
no. i'm here with you.
are you frightened?
why should i be?
i had everything. once.
so what happened?
life knocked me back.
i came into this world flat on my ass.
and now you have everything.
no. not everything.
up down. down up. it's the same. you see things through both eyes.
i guess i am. just a little.
what do you mean?
scared.
what's the matter?
i must be going.
come on. it's christmas. at least stay for breakfast.
i'm already late.
for what?
why didn't you tell me that maranzano had made you an offer?
i turned him down flat.
and if i had known, i would have warned you to expect this. we could have prepared.
masseria's been after me too.
thank you for keeping me informed.
we were overdue to get hit.
you think this is a coincidence? next week half your customers will be buying their scotch, our scotch, from maranzano. in a month, he'll be in scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. i'll be out of business, and you'll be working for maranzano.
we can operate around these guys.
not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
okay. i'm listening.
a hundred years ago austria was run by a prince named metternich. austria was weak, and it's neighbors were strong. but they were ruled by passionate men, while metternich was ruthless and brilliant. if one country got too strong, he rallied an alliance against it. he would lead all of europe to the brink of war, then bring the enemies together and forge the peace.
forget it.
fuck 'em.
we'll figure out something.
i'm supposed to be at my old man's for christmas dinner at eight.
come off it, bugs.
come off it, bugs.
ben-jamin.
johnson's still on board. even maranzano won't screw with nucky in atlantic city. but everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
i'll knock 'em in, charlie. i can do it. blow his fuckin' head off. get rid of the bastard for good.
you wouldn't live out the week.
we got exactly two choices, maranzano or masseria.
they don't give a shit about us!
masseria's scared. he might make our deal.
we can't sell out to those guys. they ain't businessmen!
but maranzano's got the men and the brains.
which is why he doesn't need us.
at least masseria plays by the rules. maranzano thinks he's god, and the rules don't apply.
without us, masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.
i'm sorry, but i sleep better when i know i'm with the winning side.
we're gonna be the winning side. it's like rothstein said about that guy in austria. we're gonna use maranzano and masseria. let 'em knock each other bloody. and then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. what they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
i thought we just wanted to be left alone to run our business.
so we're gonna knock 'em both off?
if it comes to that. yeah.
luciano.
i was calling yesterday.
something came up.
i needed to see you again.
same here.
you're sure?
why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
it's a mask.
you got something to hide?
it's too late.
have you thought about this?
why? you're the innocent one.
guess i'm too confused to think.
i'm glad ya come.
what's with the banquet? this is supposed to be a private meet.
it's only us and sonny. hey, sonny. come on out.
you boys carryin' pieces?
you tryin' ta tell me something? i don't come to a meet with a weapon unless it's with an enemy.
see if these two are my friends.
you're a smart boy, charlie, but there's somethin' you ain't learned yet. a man needs a family.
i know. when the storm hits, it don't pay to be caught outside.
i got a place for you. in my family... or in the cemetery.
never threaten me, boss.
this business is about taking risks.
calculated risks. but boss, this one don't calculate.
meyer.
it's nothin'. i'm gettin' married.
married? to anna?  you ain't got her in trouble?
no. we ain't even...
well, good. woman like that you don't have to keep an eye on.
guess i'm not a single type guy.
whatta ya mean? it's great!
we're going to atlantic city for the honeymoon.
i'll talk to nucky. get you set up like the fuckin' prince of wales.
i been thinkin'...
good. 'cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
we need to put together a meet for the whole country. we all got the same problems. we could talk. meet the guys we don't know. lift a few with the guys we do.
like a party for all our friends.
italians, jews, irish. one big party. course, some guys don't get along.
like don maranzano.
and if we don't invite maranzano, we can't invite masseria. guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
i'll handle the boss.
so we end up with everybody but the two bosses, at our meet. we ain't sayin' we're the leaders, but we're leadin'.
how soon can we pull this off?
i'm gettin' married in six weeks. i'll already be in atlantic city which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
your honeymoon, meyer?
might as well put the time to use.
you could have stopped him.
ya never tell a guy about a broad.
so you all make the same mistakes?
gives us something in common.
tommy tells me that capone's coming in from chicago.
he's trying to make it.
he'll think something's wrong i ain't there.
he'll know you were smart enough to stay away, boss.
what the fuck does that mean?
you know that if you come, we gotta invite maranzano.
so fuck him. i don't care anymore. let him come.
so he can talk to all the families behind your back? maybe have his own meet at 3:00 am under the goddamn boardwalk? no. you're too smart for a sucker play.
there seems to be some confusion about your registration. i believe i can find you a place at the ambassador. many persons of the jewish faith find it quite...
i ain't no fuckin' kike!
i'm sorry, sir. our clientele is restricted to white anglo-saxons.
and i ain't no nigger either!
sir, we do not use such names at our hotel.
you own a hotel, sir?
the bismark in chicago. you familiar?
we have a commission. if there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides.
tell me something, meyer. how can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
the commission don't decide how i spend my honeymoon.
hey, i ignore my wife too. but on our honeymoon i paid attention.
boo-boo.
not another word.
what you're sayin' makes a lotta sense. ya know, if i keep on killin' people like i have, i won't have no more friends left!
you've got the public upset, al.
but you know i never killed nobody that didn't deserve it.
when the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
what are ya tellin' me, charlie?
we're asking you to go to prison.
but i've never served a day.
if it wasn't important for everybody, we wouldn't ask. we got friends in philly. they can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge.
awwh, charlie.
minimum security. you'll have everything but broads.
where we headed?
wassa matter, mr. big shot. don't have time for my business no more?
boss, i got all the time you need.
i know about you.
and what went on your little party in atlantic city. i got ears.
that little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
money don't mean shit!
didn't know you felt that way.
you and vito are gonna pull that payroll job. right now.
you gotta plan these things.
and i got it all planned.
bastard didn't even show.
he's hidin'. word's out tommy reina's goin' over ta maranzano.
get word to maranzano. i want a meet. alone. on neutral turf.
after all this time i'd think you'd know me better, meyer.
it's not myself i'm worried about.
i'll do fine.
maranzano wants you dead.
yeah. but he needs me alive.
strategy.
talk english. okay? i did lousy at school.
the big picture.
that's just what i'm sick of. everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! greedy for what you got. a bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
so change it.
bring order out of chaos. if you lead... they'll follow.
and what do you want out of this?
a peaceful and prosperous retirement.
tell me, my son. why did you go with giuseppe? he's not our kind.
i found that out.
we learn from life.
that's why i'm here.
coming with me will be a delicate matter. we will work it out. but charlie...
conditions have changed. some people have become too powerful.
i'll take care of the boss.
if you give him the chance, lansky will betray you like judas.
i don't fuck my partners.
no worry, charlie. i will kill them for you. no one will know.
at first, it will hurt you. but you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
you're fuckin' crazy. you're all fuckin' crazy!
i booked passage to london.
london?
my friends have a country house we can use for a while.
if i look weak now, it's over.
i'm very sorry... i didn't...
oh, god. don't start actin' like a fuckin' wife on me.
you're getting' 10 cc's
i told you twenty!
you bastards, i said twenty!
it'll just be a few minutes.
i need the twenty!
everybody's talkin' about ya, charlie. first time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
guess i'm just lucky.
that's just what they're calling ya pal. lucky luciano.
masseria's confused. he can't figure whether you're workin' for maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. so he's spreadin' the word that you're goin' after profaci because it happened on his turf. i figure masseria's gonna try to rub out profaci, and pin it on us. then maranzano will have to kill ya.
you got men on profaci's place?
we got our boys paintin' the house next door. around the clock. we're gonna keep old man profaci alive if it takes twenty coats.
tommy reina's gone over to maranzano, but so far masseria ain't lifted a finger,
the fat man's scared. scared of us, and scared without us. same with maranzano. we gotta get their minds back on each other. this fuckin' peace is killin' us.
we can get the war started tomorrow, but it won't be pretty.
who?
tommy reina.
what you mean? tommy ain't done nothin'.
maranzano will think masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
why's it gotta be tommy!
masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. and as long as we keep the boss alive, maranzano can't win without you.
i'm a hard guy. i done more jobs than alla you combined. and i never said no. not once. but dammit i don't understand why the hell we gotta kill our friends!
because the world ain't big enough for the dons. so we gotta choose between our friends and ourselves. it ain't the way i'd make the world, but that's the way it is.
we're gonna change it, bugs. once we get rid of the dons, the commission's gonna rule. no more wars. no more vendettas. no more boss of all the bosses.
yeah. and no more tommy reina.
masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. but his patience won't hold out much longer.
how's bugsy doin'?
tommy reina's hauntin' his dreams. but he'll do his job.
a lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. i'm sorry you got hit by it.
you must be feeling better, if you're looking for sex again.
would it be painful for you?
it always is.
jeez, bugsy. ya like ta scared the crap outta me.
just wanted ta say hello.
know something tommy? you're a mensch.
that a jew compliment?
best we got.
awww... deep down i'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
guess so. ya got a minute? i got somethin' for ya.
take any one ya like.
kinda early for christmas, bugs.
a jew's gotta let his heart tell him when ta give his presents.
you're fuckin' crazy.
but only on purpose, tommy.
this is nice. i mean it.
if i wanted ta kill ya, i woulda done it long ago. it's not like you ain't given me reason.
i'm still the boss of all the bosses! and you'll do what i say!
so tell me when i ain't done it.
how can i trust you when you look at me like that?
you got no fuckin' choice. you might be able to stay alive, but you're never gonna win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
tell me, charlie. please.
why should i go against you, boss? nobody can handle this business like you. maranzano'll never know the crap that you forget. he's got no business bein' boss. the idea makes me wanna puke. you're the boss, an it's gonna stay that way.
even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
they do what i tell 'em.
salvatore. always holding himself above.
you and me both. sal-va-to-re.
we must be friends, charlie.
keep my terms and i won't be your enemy.
the terms will be mine.
the guy doin' the job names the price. if you don't like it, you can kill masseria yourself.
i will be the boss of all bosses.
what makes you think i give a damn about that sicilian crap?
tell it to the calabrian. tell it to the jews.
you disrespect our tradition.
boss, we got our own tradition. we call it treatin' your friends right, and not bein' a pig for every scrap of glory.
charlie!
i do this for you, and you'll leave me and my guys alone. be the fuckin' boss of all the other bosses, but we are gonna be our own bosses.
forget it. that's past.
no matter what you say to me salvatore, you are my bambino.
what are ya thinkin'?
joe profaci. carlo gambino. vinnie mangano. joe bananas. they all gotta die.
you can't fuck with them. they're heads of families!
they're friends of our enemy.
take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
not if they all die at once.
every successor will owe his loyalty to us. together we take out maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
a mother-fuckin' peace conference.
we gotta talk in private. i got a friend in coney island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
but that's an hour's drive.
lobster fra diavolo. spaghetti with red clam sauce. antipasto. and pastry that'll make you wanna go home and slap your sweet mama.
ya did good. i ain't seen the boss so happy in weeks.
look at this boy. he hardly eats. like that fella killed caesar.
when ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it ain't upstairs where it needs to be.
the kid just called me stupid.
not stupid. fat.
shit. when i was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. right, gerardo?
sure. but ya got a deck a cards? i wanna play some klob.
come on, charlie. we got business.
couple hands. no harm in it.
one move pardner, and you're a dead man.
you can't kill me. you gave your word, charlie.
so? i'll get bugs ta do it.
mad dog coll's in town on a job.
who hired the bastard?
maranzano. ta ice you.
charlie?
i'm doin' business here!
but there's...
i'm gonna lose you, charlie.
it'll all be over tomorrow. no more wars. no more killin'. just livin' normal like everybody else.  you'll be stuck with me for good.
meyer, ain't anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
what's your problem?
it's just that maranzano's the only bastard i ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the irs. he came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
seein' he loved the experience so much, i think we outta give him the pleasure again.
yes?
i'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
luciano is dead?
open a window. every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.
what a cozy little scene.
kill them! kill them!
what's it worth to ya, boss?
anything!
anything ain't a very hard number.
one hundred thousand. no... three hundred thousand.
now that's a hard number.
up here, boss.
that ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
but from now on it's lucky's spot.
maybe you better hear what i got to say first.
whatever you say, boss.
no, al. whatever we say. we're all bosses here. we don' need another.
come on, charlie. we gotta have a top guy. otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
as long as ya got one top boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. and that's war on top of war.
who'll make the rules?
we'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. all of us. together. we all get one vote. includin' me.
charlie, i'm from the old country, and these american ways get me sometimes confused. you tellin' us you refuse the title of boss of all the bosses?
i don't care what anybody calls me, joe. long as it ain't to dirty. and if you fellas get together every year and say, "charlie, we still want you to run things for us", i ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
julius caesar never took no vote.
and maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of rome.
why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
you scare me, charlie.
maybe that's why i'm the boss.
