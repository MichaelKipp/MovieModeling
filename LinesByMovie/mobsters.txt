yeah. so who the fuck does?
come on. tell us, shitface.
you fellas got names?
lansky. meyer lansky. and that is bugsy siegel ya got there.
how much longer we got to be shut up in this fuckin' sweatbox?
long as charlie says.
when the stiff's an irish, the cops take it kinda personal.
can not we get a couple whores over?
you am not even a man yet.
that am not what your mama said.
where did ya get this funny ravioli?
ya ignorant guinea, it is kreplach.
four-twenty-eight.
what is that divided four ways?
a hundred-seven bucks too much. any kid who drops an extra dime is going to be talkin' to moliari.
ya mean we are so rich we are broke?
they told me you wanted to talk about this shane business.
you havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
shane was a friend of yours?
he was around...
lad, I am a busy man. july's always a big month for murder. fella named barone turned up just this mornin', throat cut ear to ear.  black hand.
when you are investigatin', how long ya keep at it?
it consoles the bereaved family ta see the perpetrator take his load of juice. we try to oblige.
but if ya can not catch the guys...
tommy reina. good pal. better partner.
from your mouth ta god's ear.
he is got a line on the good stuff.
no disrespect, tommy, but why would mr. arnold rothstein wanna do business with bums like us?
why ya always got to go lookin' for a gift in the mouth of the horse?
we could lose the deal!
if we have to.
so chicago's been good to ya.
i do right by johnny torrio and he does right by me.
ya still owe me fifty bucks for the train ticket.
and a lot more. can we talk?
sure. what is with the brick wall?
since colosimo bit it, i gotta keep an eye out for his friends.
one fuckin' year ago i had ta hit you up for train fare. now i can buy the fuckin' train. and i am not even a fuckin' sicilian!
but ya got a boss.
torrio am not like them guys. he thinks like an american. you would like him, charlie. he would like you.
maybe. but he would still be the boss.
when my money moves, i go with it.
i trust mr. johnson filled you in on the revisions.
scotch is a very valuable commodity these days.
mr. rothstein, can i be frank? you are a gambler, and i know you have had losses. i also know you could sell to maranzano or masseria for fifty g's, but nobody sells to those guys once. so if ya really got another buyer, and ya wanna welch, i am not going to beef.
i am not mad. i am not even surprised. but i can not let ya fuck me. on the other hand, if ya got needs beyond the thirty-five, I will advance it to you against our next deal on the same terms.
could we step outside?
i got my partner in there!
i cannot bear to look at that hideous suit one minute more.
their asses are here, but their fuckin' heads are still in sicily.
precisely. we are the true entrepreneurs, and prohibition is the greatest opportunity we shall ever have. america is begging to be taken like an overripe virgin, but they are still fighting over the crumbs of little italy.
we will start small. when we got 'em lined up, we increase the supply a bit at a time. only sell the best stuff. and keep the price high, 'cause ya know how folks hate the taste of cheap booze.
an intelligent plan, mr. luciano, but listen to me well. it can be ruined in a single careless moment. keep your feet on the ground and your high opinion of yourself under your hat.
do not worry. i got friends to take care of that.
meyer just finished the books.
a million bucks. in the last six months.
I am bobby clowes. kansas city.
charlie luciano.
you ever been near a meat packing plant? my father makes a couple million per, but the smell in his office is enough to make you puke.
got the same problem with my pop -- garlic. nothin' you can do.
the goddamned bastards.
tell me about it.
i remember reading a poem in college. "sicily. poor, noble isle...".
poor, yeah.
but not you.
don maranzano. welcome.
I have heard so much about this club of yours. i had to come and see.
good liquor draws a good crowd.
i must know more of you, my son.
not a lot ta know.
then perhaps you need to know me.
don, I would be honored.
know somethin'? this stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
shuddup.
wanna know what i think?
spare us.
i think these rich shits -- no offense bobby -- are so dead below the waist that they got to ride around all day swingin' at each other ta get their broads hot.
inside, they were talking of you.
i can just imagine.
no. they envy you.
for being a bootlegger?
for being a man.
salvatore. my young caesar. first me, sallie. then you.
the name's charlie.
mussolini is raping sicily like every roman before him. so our brothers are coming to america. soldiers willing to fight and die. men who know the meaning of honor.
don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
and how many soldiers do you have?
I have got friends.
i have six hundred. soldiers. and more every week off the boat.
an' masseria's got seven hundred.
he is an animal!
he is the boss of all the bosses, and i respect him.
the internal revenue came to my offices. i turned over all my ledgers. they found nothing. charlie, i am a businessman.
sittin' around gives me the piles. you got a proposition?
we combine everything. you are my second in command.
what about the share.
you get fifteen percent.
i got partners.
your calabrian friend, i will accept. at least costello eats pasta like us.
and the jews?
share with them as you wish. do business with them on your own. but no filthy jew will ever be a brother to me.
those fucks can not leave each other alone. maranzano and masseria am not going to be satisfied until one of 'em starts a war.
let 'em kill each other off! why should we care?
there will not be any way to stay out of it.
i think maranzano's talkin' a hell of a deal.
sure, frankie. fuck me. fuck meyer. fuck arnold rothstein who is made us all rich. all so you can be an fuckin' honorary sicilian!
does maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you will take his goddamn money?
if he is going to fuck me up the ass!
bugsy, you and i do not need to be in business with maranzano. we got more jobs than we can handle. that is not the problem.
so what is the problem?
the minute we sell out to maranzano, that bastard is gonna have you knocked off.
the deal's too good, frankie
what are ya thinkin', charlie?
if ever i need a boss, joe.
yeah. yeah. i bet ya feed maranzano that same line.
i like that.
whatta ya mean, boss?
ya piss like a man.
well...
mr. costello handles our business with the government agencies.
that is it.
where is the stiff?
come on. be polite.
sorry, charlie. i gotta get my johnson worked tonight.
jesus.
hell. it is been four days!
you here with bobby?
no. I am here with you.
are you frightened?
why should i be?
i had everything. once.
so what happened?
life knocked me back.
i came into this world flat on my ass.
and now you have everything.
no. not everything.
up down. down up. it is the same. you see things through both eyes.
i guess i am. just a little.
what do you mean?
scared.
what is the matter?
i must be going.
come on. it is christmas. at least stay for breakfast.
I am already late.
for what?
why did not you tell me that maranzano had made you an offer?
i turned him down flat.
and if i had known, i would have warned you to expect this. we could have prepared.
masseria's been after me too.
thank you for keeping me informed.
we were overdue to get hit.
you think this is a coincidence? next week half your customers will be buying their scotch, our scotch, from maranzano. in a month, he will be in scotland talking to my distillers, because you can not move product. I will be out of business, and you will be working for maranzano.
we can operate around these guys.
not by scurrying around like a puppies in a roomful of elephants.
okay. I am listening.
a hundred years ago austria was run by a prince named metternich. austria was weak, and it is neighbors were strong. but they were ruled by passionate men, while metternich was ruthless and brilliant. if one country got too strong, he rallied an alliance against it. he would lead all of europe to the brink of war, then bring the enemies together and forge the peace.
forget it.
fuck 'em.
we will figure out something.
I am supposed to be at my old man's for christmas dinner at eight.
come off it, bugs.
come off it, bugs.
ben-jamin.
johnson's still on board. even maranzano will not screw with nucky in atlantic city. but everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
I will knock 'em in, charlie. i can do it. blow his fuckin' head off. get rid of the bastard for good.
you would not live out the week.
we got exactly two choices, maranzano or masseria.
they do not give a shit about us!
masseria's scared. he might make our deal.
we can not sell out to those guys. they am not businessmen!
but maranzano's got the men and the brains.
which is why he does not need us.
at least masseria plays by the rules. maranzano thinks he is god, and the rules do not apply.
without us, masseria do not stand a chance, and he knows it.
I am sorry, but i sleep better when i know I am with the winning side.
we are going to be the winning side. it is like rothstein said about that guy in austria. we are going to use maranzano and masseria. let 'em knock each other bloody. and then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. what they are fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.
i thought we just wanted to be left alone to run our business.
so we are going to knock 'em both off?
if it comes to that. yeah.
luciano.
i was calling yesterday.
something came up.
i needed to see you again.
same here.
you are sure?
why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
it is a mask.
you got something to hide?
it is too late.
have you thought about this?
why? you are the innocent one.
guess I am too confused to think.
I am glad ya come.
what is with the banquet? this is supposed to be a private meet.
it is only us and sonny. hey, sonny. come on out.
you boys carryin' pieces?
you tryin' ta tell me something? i do not come to a meet with a weapon unless it is with an enemy.
see if these two are my friends.
you are a smart boy, charlie, but there is somethin' you am not learned yet. a man needs a family.
i know. when the storm hits, it do not pay to be caught outside.
i got a place for you. in my family... or in the cemetery.
never threaten me, boss.
this business is about taking risks.
calculated risks. but boss, this one do not calculate.
meyer.
it is nothin'. I am gettin' married.
married? to anna?  you am not got her in trouble?
no. we am not even...
well, good. woman like that you do not have to keep an eye on.
guess I am not a single type guy.
whatta ya mean? it is great!
we are going to atlantic city for the honeymoon.
I will talk to nucky. get you set up like the fuckin' prince of wales.
i been thinkin'...
good. 'cause every time you start thinkin', we end up makin' money.
we need to put together a meet for the whole country. we all got the same problems. we could talk. meet the guys we do not know. lift a few with the guys we do.
like a party for all our friends.
italians, jews, irish. one big party. course, some guys do not get along.
like don maranzano.
and if we do not invite maranzano, we can not invite masseria. guys do not wanna be choosin' sides.
I will handle the boss.
so we end up with everybody but the two bosses, at our meet. we am not sayin' we are the leaders, but we are leadin'.
how soon can we pull this off?
I am gettin' married in six weeks. I will already be in atlantic city which is probably the best place to do it anyway.
your honeymoon, meyer?
might as well put the time to use.
you could have stopped him.
ya never tell a guy about a broad.
so you all make the same mistakes?
gives us something in common.
tommy tells me that capone's coming in from chicago.
he is trying to make it.
he will think something is wrong i am not there.
he will know you were smart enough to stay away, boss.
what the fuck does that mean?
you know that if you come, we gotta invite maranzano.
so fuck him. i do not care anymore. let him come.
so he can talk to all the families behind your back? maybe have his own meet at 3:00 am under the goddamn boardwalk? no. you are too smart for a sucker play.
there seems to be some confusion about your registration. i believe i can find you a place at the ambassador. many persons of the jewish faith find it quite...
i am not no fuckin' kike!
I am sorry, sir. our clientele is restricted to white anglo-saxons.
and i am not no nigger either!
sir, we do not use such names at our hotel.
you own a hotel, sir?
the bismark in chicago. you familiar?
we have a commission. if there is a dispute over territory, the commission decides.
tell me something, meyer. how can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you are on your honeymoon?
the commission do not decide how i spend my honeymoon.
hey, i ignore my wife too. but on our honeymoon i paid attention.
boo-boo.
not another word.
what you are sayin' makes a lotta sense. ya know, if i keep on killin' people like i have, i will not have no more friends left!
you have got the public upset, al.
but you know i never killed nobody that did not deserve it.
when the people get so upset, our politician friends gotta listen.
what are ya tellin' me, charlie?
we are asking you to go to prison.
but I have never served a day.
if it was not important for everybody, we would not ask. we got friends in philly. they can send you up for a couple months on a weapons charge.
awwh, charlie.
minimum security. you will have everything but broads.
where we headed?
wassa matter, mr. big shot. do not have time for my business no more?
boss, i got all the time you need.
i know about you.
and what went on your little party in atlantic city. i got ears.
that little party's going to make you a lotta money.
money do not mean shit!
did not know you felt that way.
you and vito are gonna pull that payroll job. right now.
you gotta plan these things.
and i got it all planned.
bastard did not even show.
he is hidin'. word's out tommy reina's goin' over ta maranzano.
get word to maranzano. i want a meet. alone. on neutral turf.
after all this time I would think you would know me better, meyer.
it is not myself I am worried about.
I will do fine.
maranzano wants you dead.
yeah. but he needs me alive.
strategy.
talk english. okay? i did lousy at school.
the big picture.
that is just what I am sick of. everybody lookin' ta knock somebody off! greedy for what you got. a bunch of fuckin' hogs at the trough.
so change it.
bring order out of chaos. if you lead... they will follow.
and what do you want out of this?
a peaceful and prosperous retirement.
tell me, my son. why did you go with giuseppe? he is not our kind.
i found that out.
we learn from life.
that is why I am here.
coming with me will be a delicate matter. we will work it out. but charlie...
conditions have changed. some people have become too powerful.
I will take care of the boss.
if you give him the chance, lansky will betray you like judas.
i do not fuck my partners.
no worry, charlie. i will kill them for you. no one will know.
at first, it will hurt you. but you will come to understand and we will be strong together.
you are fuckin' crazy. you are all fuckin' crazy!
i booked passage to london.
london?
my friends have a country house we can use for a while.
if i look weak now, it is over.
I am very sorry... i didn't...
oh, god. do not start actin' like a fuckin' wife on me.
you are getting' 10 cc's
i told you twenty!
you bastards, i said twenty!
it will just be a few minutes.
i need the twenty!
everybody's talkin' about ya, charlie. first time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
guess I am just lucky.
that is just what they are calling ya pal. lucky luciano.
masseria's confused. he can not figure whether you are workin' for maranzano, or gettin' ready to kill the bastard. so he is spreadin' the word that you are goin' after profaci because it happened on his turf. i figure masseria's going to try to rub out profaci, and pin it on us. then maranzano will have to kill ya.
you got men on profaci's place?
we got our boys paintin' the house next door. around the clock. we are going to keep old man profaci alive if it takes twenty coats.
tommy reina's gone over to maranzano, but so far masseria am not lifted a finger,
the fat man's scared. scared of us, and scared without us. same with maranzano. we got to get their minds back on each other. this fuckin' peace is killin' us.
we can get the war started tomorrow, but it will not be pretty.
who?
tommy reina.
what you mean? tommy am not done nothin'.
maranzano will think masseria ordered the hit, and will not have no choice but to start the war.
why is it got to be tommy!
masseria will not have any choice but to trust you. and as long as we keep the boss alive, maranzano can not win without you.
I am a hard guy. i done more jobs than alla you combined. and i never said no. not once. but dammit i do not understand why the hell we got to kill our friends!
because the world am not big enough for the dons. so we got to choose between our friends and ourselves. it am not the way I would make the world, but that is the way it is.
we are going to change it, bugs. once we get rid of the dons, the commission's going to rule. no more wars. no more vendettas. no more boss of all the bosses.
yeah. and no more tommy reina.
masseria's tryin' ta find a way around ya. but his patience will not hold out much longer.
how is bugsy doin'?
tommy reina's hauntin' his dreams. but he will do his job.
a lot of shit came out of me in the hospital. I am sorry you got hit by it.
you must be feeling better, if you are looking for sex again.
would it be painful for you?
it always is.
jeez, bugsy. ya like ta scared the crap outta me.
just wanted ta say hello.
know something tommy? you are a mensch.
that a jew compliment?
best we got.
awww... deep down I am a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can not make enemies.
guess so. ya got a minute? i got somethin' for ya.
take any one ya like.
kinda early for christmas, bugs.
a jew's got to let his heart tell him when ta give his presents.
you are fuckin' crazy.
but only on purpose, tommy.
this is nice. i mean it.
if i wanted ta kill ya, i woulda done it long ago. it is not like you am not given me reason.
I am still the boss of all the bosses! and you will do what i say!
so tell me when i am not done it.
how can i trust you when you look at me like that?
you got no fuckin' choice. you might be able to stay alive, but you are never going to win the war from these fuckin' rat holes.
tell me, charlie. please.
why should i go against you, boss? nobody can handle this business like you. maranzano'll never know the crap that you forget. he is got no business bein' boss. the idea makes me wanna puke. you are the boss, an it is going to stay that way.
even the beasts of the earth know who rightfully reigns.
they do what i tell 'em.
salvatore. always holding himself above.
you and me both. sal-va-to-re.
we must be friends, charlie.
keep my terms and i will not be your enemy.
the terms will be mine.
the guy doin' the job names the price. if you do not like it, you can kill masseria yourself.
i will be the boss of all bosses.
what makes you think i give a damn about that sicilian crap?
tell it to the calabrian. tell it to the jews.
you disrespect our tradition.
boss, we got our own tradition. we call it treatin' your friends right, and not bein' a pig for every scrap of glory.
charlie!
i do this for you, and you will leave me and my guys alone. be the fuckin' boss of all the other bosses, but we are going to be our own bosses.
forget it. that is past.
no matter what you say to me salvatore, you are my bambino.
what are ya thinkin'?
joe profaci. carlo gambino. vinnie mangano. joe bananas. they all gotta die.
you can not fuck with them. they are heads of families!
they are friends of our enemy.
take one of 'em out, and they will all line up against us.
not if they all die at once.
every successor will owe his loyalty to us. together we take out maranzano, and each family gets a piece of his operation.
a mother-fuckin' peace conference.
we got to talk in private. i got a friend in coney island who is going to open his restaurant just for us.
but that is an hour's drive.
lobster fra diavolo. spaghetti with red clam sauce. antipasto. and pastry that will make you wanna go home and slap your sweet mama.
ya did good. i am not seen the boss so happy in weeks.
look at this boy. he hardly eats. like that fella killed caesar.
when ya got all that blood workin' in your belly, it am not upstairs where it needs to be.
the kid just called me stupid.
not stupid. fat.
shit. when i was comin' up, bein' fat meant ya had somethin' ta eat. guy looked like you, people felt sorry for 'em. right, gerardo?
sure. but ya got a deck a cards? i wanna play some klob.
come on, charlie. we got business.
couple hands. no harm in it.
one move pardner, and you are a dead man.
you can not kill me. you gave your word, charlie.
so? I will get bugs ta do it.
mad dog coll's in town on a job.
who hired the bastard?
maranzano. ta ice you.
charlie?
I am doin' business here!
but there's...
I am going to lose you, charlie.
it will all be over tomorrow. no more wars. no more killin'. just livin' normal like everybody else.  you will be stuck with me for good.
meyer, am not anybody ever told you ya look more like a bookkeeper than a fuckin' mobster?
what is your problem?
it is just that maranzano's the only bastard i ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the irs. he came out clean, so he thinks his shit do not stink.
is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
seein' he loved the experience so much, i think we outta give him the pleasure again.
yes?
I am comin' for my twenty thousand.
luciano is dead?
open a window. every newsboy in town's screamin' about it.
what a cozy little scene.
kill them! kill them!
what is it worth to ya, boss?
anything!
anything am not a very hard number.
one hundred thousand. no... three hundred thousand.
now that is a hard number.
up here, boss.
that am not exactly been the lucky spot lately.
but from now on it is lucky's spot.
maybe you better hear what i got to say first.
whatever you say, boss.
no, al. whatever we say. we are all bosses here. we don' need another.
come on, charlie. we got to have a top guy. otherwise these wars am not never going to stop.
as long as ya got one top boss, somebody else's always going to be looking to knock him off. and that is war on top of war.
who will make the rules?
we will make 'em, and we will enforce 'em. all of us. together. we all get one vote. includin' me.
charlie, I am from the old country, and these american ways get me sometimes confused. you tellin' us you refuse the title of boss of all the bosses?
i do not care what anybody calls me, joe. long as it am not to dirty. and if you fellas get together every year and say, "charlie, we still want you to run things for us", i am not going to insult ya by sayin' no.
julius caesar never took no vote.
and maybe that is why he ended up dead in the streets of rome.
why should you be payin' me when we are all equals?
you scare me, charlie.
maybe that is why I am the boss.
