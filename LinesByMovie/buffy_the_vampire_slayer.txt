i can't!
you know you must.  there is only one.  now you are that one.  it is time.
why?  why me?
she has died.  you are the next to be called.  why do you think you were sent to me?  trained as you were?  you bear the mark.
the mark of the coven.
i do not understand.
ever since adam and eve first left the garden, he followed: the serpent. satan.  he sends his legion in the shape of men, to feed on us, to breed his hell on our earth.  they are a plague upon us.
but as long as there have been vampire, there has been the coven; the line of slayers.  ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. one dies, the next is called.
I am just a girl.
you are much more.
mr. howard is so heinous.  he is always giving me a hard time.  i get a c-plus on the test and he tells me, 'you have no sense of history.'  i have no sense of history?  he wears a brown tie.
you got a c-plus?  i can not believe i cheated off you.
excuse me for not knowing about el salvador.  like I am ever going to spain anyway.  ooh!
guys, what is the sitch?  I am bored.
) what do you think?
please.  it is so '91.
what are we doing?
why do not we see a movie?
well, where?
omniplex?
nee sitch.  no way.
no thx.
they do not even have dolby.
beverly center.
please.  they show previews for foreign movies.
totally stale.  and the ushers are like, the acne patrol.  we are thinking pavilion.  sitch?
sounds toasty.  we are going pavilion.
excellent.
what is playing there?
excuse much!  not rude or anything.
nice ensemble!
so, is jeffrey really spending the night at your house?
that is the plan.
good enough!
your parents are always going away for the weekend.  you are so lucky.
yeah, i guess.
my mom does not go anywhere.  she even does the shopping network. I am going to die a virgin.
what did jeffrey's dad say?
'just remember you are in training, son'
oh, god.
he is so bald.
will you guys shut up, please?
it could happen.
booo!
suck!
wrong answer!  no prize.
god!  take a chill lozenge.
like we do not have rights too?
no, we didn't.
oh, yeah.  but i still want to know what happens.
oh, my god.  is that true?
probably.  what movie is this?
nice game.
jeffrey, i do not mean to sound sexist or anything, but can i borrow her?
andy!
bessel!  what are you doing here?
hi, grueller.
what are you grinning at?  you think i was scared?
could be.
you think so?
could be.
listen, you little worm.  i could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like i did last year, you got that?  you got that?
got that.
good.
you okay?
i... yeah, I am okay.  I am fine.
well... it is possible they think my name's bobby.
real 'quality-timers,' hugh.
something like that.
hey, it works for me.  if they want to leave you alone in the house, all helpless and vulnerable...
what show is this?
it is the news, buffy.
oh.  who is in it?  i know what it is.  it is what is on instead of the movie.
i just want to see the basketball scores.  it is important.
mmmnkay.
oh, wow.  oh, wow.  oh, wow.
you were having a nightmare.
what did you dream about?
nothing.
come on, what was it?
nothing.  it was just a dream.
the homelesses?
oh, please.
are there any good sicknesses that are not too depressing?
guys.  the environment.  I am telling you, it is totally key.  the earth is in terrible shape, we could al die, and besides, sting's doing it.
hey there.
hi.
it has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
'one that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
it is a pretty crucial subject.
see, cassandra likes it.  cassandra's my friend.
i like it.  can i be your friend?
stay away from my thang.  sorry, honey.  'thing.'
environment.  that is cool with me.
okay.
well, um... litter?
litter, yeah!
write that down.
okay, what else?
bugs.
okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
oh, yeah!
right!
man has a complex.
he is got a...  what do you call it? a napoleonic code.
let's meet tonight, okay?
where?
cafe blase.
cool.  we can figure decorations and stuff.
cassandra, you gotta come, too.
can't.  history report.  the normans and the saxons.
bogutude.  blow it off.
i really can't.  besides, it is pretty interesting.
you are weird and I am afraid of you. seriously, cassandra, there is a lot cooler things you could be doing than your homework.
like what?
like my homework.
i do not see why we have to invite everyone.
kimberly, it is the senior dance.
if we do not invite all the seniors we can not use the school funds, you know that.
can not they make exceptions?  maryanne heinel?  she is such a scud.  can not we have a maryanne clause?
well, look who is here.
come on, come on, fork up the scub.
that is it, man.  that is the whole story.
we are looking at a dog, possible coffee...
it is coffee.
amazing!
smell of booze much.
nice much.
can we have a hot dog, please, medium rare, and a cup of joe?
you guys are thrashed.
yeah, we are drunk.  we are the drunks. what is your name?
buffy.
figures.
do people ever call you 'buffy the buffalo?'  I am just wondering.
the don't.  you kind of wish they would, though.
wit-tay.
I am sorry.  I am pike.  this is benny.
pike is not a name.  it is a fish.
hey, wait a minute...
you are the guys from the movie!
we hate you guys!
hey!  she wasted my dog!
bummer metaphor.
rich bitches.  they are a plague. they have got to be stopped.
you did not like them.
they are all the same!  they are so stuck up, they are just... they are not even human.  i hate them.
would you sleep with them?
yes.  definitely.  definitely. please, god.
well, there it is, is not it?  you do not even like them, and you would sleep with them.  what is that all about?
i got a news flash, man, another shot of this and I will have sex with you.
oh, yeah, and then you will never call me.
come one, that was so weird.
what, it is not weird.  i just cut the stupid hot dog in half.
i can not believe they still ate it.
where did you learn how to do that?
i did not learn... i just... it is not a big deal.
buffy, I am going to tell jeffrey you were playing with another man's hebrew national.
get a boob job.
what happened?
buffy was on the uneven parallels -- she was really good; coach said she could have been in the olympics -- but she was doing a routine, spinning, and the beam broke.
you are kidding.
snapped.  buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and i swear to god she went across the room.  perm over heels.
oh, my god!  ouch!  no wonder you quit.
well, that is the thing.  she landed on her feet.  did not even sprain a toe.  and i go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she is like this --
-- like she is going to kill me.
i was just scared is all.
no.  it was mondo bizarro.
buffy, the ape-woman.
seriously, buffy.  that look was way twisted.  what were you thinking about?
when you get your car together, man, let's bail.
you think?  split?
utterly.  let's bail this town. it is getting... i do not know.  let's go somewhere where there are not any rich bitches.
our own world, where we could live and grow beans.  hundreds of beans.
that is so cool.
thank you very much.
nobody is even gonna look at the game.
hey, i was thinking, for the dance, what about a big sign that says 'don't tread on me'.  you know, and a picture of the earth.
do not tread on the earth?
i do not get it.
how do you not tread on the earth? i mean, you kind of have to.
i never thought of that.
i gotta bail.  you coming?
you guys blow.  I am waiting on cassandra.  she is going to help me with my history.
cassandra's really smart.
yeah... she is okay, though.
i guess.
are you going out with jeffrey tonight?
jealous?
do not worry, jennifer.  someday your prince will come.
yeah, just make sure you do first. let's go, guys.
b'bye.
god, where the hell did you come from?  you scared me to death.
I am sorry.  that was impressive. the...  tumbling.
what?  oh.  i used to do gymnastics. are you looking for someone?
I am looking for you, actually.
am i in trouble or something?
not at all.  my name is merrick.  i was sent to find you some time ago. i should have found you much sooner but there were...  complications. you should have been taught, prepared.
what are you talking about?
I have searched the entire world for you, buffy.
why?
to bring you... your birthright.
my birthright?  you mean, like a trust fund?
i had a trust fund my great- grandfather, or maybe it was an inheritance, 'cause he is dead, and i spent it on shoes.
you must come with me.  it is much too late already.  you must come with me to the graveyard.
wait a minute.  my birthright is in the graveyard?  later not.
wait!
you are one of those skanky old men that, like, attack girls and stuff. forget you.  my, um, my boyfriend is going to be here in about thirty seconds, and he is way testy.
you do not understand.  you have been chosen.
chosen to go to the graveyard?  why do not you just take the first runner up, okay?
you must believe me.  you must come with me while there is still time.
time to do what?
to stop the killing.  to stop the vampires.
let me get this straight.  you are like, this greasy bum, and i have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I am chosen, and there is vampires.
yes.
does elvis talk to you?  tell you to do things?  do you see spots?
i do not have time for your prattling. i have proof.  you bear the mark.
just stay away from me, okay?
did you ever dream that you were someone else?
everybody does.
in the past.  a girl.  maybe... a magyar peasant.  an indian princess. a slave.
i was a slave.
in virginia.
i do not know.  it was...  there was a big gram or something.  and there is one, I am like a prostitute...
china.
oh, my god.  i never told anybody about this.  i remember the one about the peasant, too.  god, there is a bunch.  is this, like channeling or something.
i had a dream once where i was... there was like, knights in it, and i worked in this bar.  and i... was fighting.  I am always fighting. and there is a guy...  he is not always there, but he is horrible, all white, and he is always... trying to kill me.
lothos.
how do you know all this?
i have to show you.
i can not believe I am doing this.  i can not believe I am in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
why did not you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
oh, yeah, tell everyone I am crazy. beauty ida.
ow.
cramps?
none of your business.  god.
this is it.
wait a minute.
just for protection.  you will not have to do anything.  i just need you to watch.
all right.  what do we do now?
we wait for robert to wake up.
where is the other one?
she --
go to school tomorrow.  try to act normal.  do not let anyone know what is happening.  this is important. when the vampires find out who you are... you will not be hunting them anymore.
all right.
meet me at this address after school.
i have cheerleading squad.
skip it.
they can not come in, right?  unless you invite them.  is that true?
it is true.
do you know what time it is?
uum... around ten?
hey, baby, how ya doing?  you look beat.
i do?  i guess i do.
where were you last night?  i called your house like four times.
i went to sleep.  i think i have the flu or something.
i can not get sick.  you know -- training and all.  I am going to be late.
'bye.
hey, buffers.  you look thrashed.
thanks.
you and cassandra get anything done last night?
i find it restorative, sleeping in the life-blood of so many.  to feel their souls coursing about me.
what is happening?  what do you want?
so very much.
my parents have money...
yes, I am sure they do.  this place is everything you said it was, amilyn.
what... are you?
are we so strange?  so alien to you?  I have seen this culture, the wealth, the greed, the waste... it is truly heartwarming.  the perfect place to spread my empire.  honestly, eastern europe was so dead, the communists just drained the blood out of the place.  it is livened up a bit in the past few years, but it is nothing compared to this.... this mecca of consumption.  the city of angels.
i do not think this is gold.
not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  almost thoughtful. she is useless.
no, wait.  i can be dumb.  really. or mean, or whatever.  i can learn. I am useful.
really?
swear to god.
it is not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.
our purposes.
what, um...  what do we do?
there is a great deal i have to show you, I am not even sure where to start  there is so little time.
why do you keep saying that?
do you know what a vampire-king is?
a vampire-king?  you mean like dracula?
oh, yes.  and the man from your dreams.  lothos.
oh, him.
yes.  they travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork.  the vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own.  you were difficult to trace, and i think the process has gone a lot further than I would anticipated.  usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy.  but for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.
what?
we will cover it later.
i still do not get how they happened to come to my town.  i mean, was i born here because... because they were coming here?  that lothos guy, and his buddies?
in a way, yes.  your fate is inexorably connected to them.
great.  first i have a birthright, now I have got a fate.  hey, do i have to take notes on this?
we are going to have the work hard. you will need some excuse for staying out.  for your parents.
not a pressing issue.
i tell you, the best thing i can do right now is find out more about you.  what your strengths are, your likes...  everything.  what is your best subject?
uh... gym.
yes, you used to do gymnastics. but you stopped.  why?
well, everybody says... it is just kind of dorky.  i mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs?  they are like --  -- the mighty oak.  it is not a look.
but you enjoyed it, yes?
well... i do cheerleading now. it is way cooler.
cheerleading.  for... sporting events, yes?
sporting events, yeah.
all right.  why do not you show me a cheer?
here?
yes, yes.  it would be interesting. a nice cheer.
okay.
who we gonna beat?
who we gonna beat?
no -- you do not have to --
oh.  i thought... you lead me --
no.  you do not do anything.  i do it.
oh.  good.
oh, what the hell is wrong with you?  you threw a knife at my head!
i had to test you.
but you threw a knife at my head!
and you caught it!  only the chosen one could have done that.
i do not want to be the chosen one, okay?  i do not want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires!  i just want to graduate from high school, go to europe, marry charlie sheen and die.  it may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but i think it is swell.  and then you come along...  and... and then I am a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!
it was necessary.
last night.  you knew i was sitting on a fresh grave, did not you?
i do not think you understand the full implications of --
oh.  sorry.
do not you see what is happening? you are changing.  you have got powers you have only just begun to tap. physical, mental prowess you have never dreamed of.  god, this hurts.  I have administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working.  I am sorry i have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.
put your head back.
two days ago, would you have even hit me?  let alone so powerfully?
no... i guess i would have gotten jeffrey to hit you.
exactly.  you are changing.  you are becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
ooh, another embarrassment for the teabag, while the chosen one is still well under par.
your turn.
what about bats?  do they turn into bats?
no.  no bats, no flying.  they... float, occasionally.  not really flying.
toasty.  were there ever any, like, famous vampires?
oh, several.  lucretia borgia, joseph mengele, franklin pangborn... are any of those names familiar?
if i say 'no' does that make me a bad person?
good lord.  what do you study in history?
my nails.
all right.  you have heard of the emperor caligula, perhaps?  or jack the ripper?
they were vampires?
same one.
oh.
what!?!
try to pay attention.
benny, man, where you been?  you bailed on me, i passed out, man, i almost did a jimi hendrix!
let me in.
hey, I am trying, but this window is burnt --
invite me in, pike.
wait a minute.  what is wrong with you, man?
I am fine.
you look like shit, benny.
i... feel.... pretty.
no offense, man, but i think you are on something nasty.  why do not you just go and cool out and I will see you in the morning or something.
the sun!  it burns!  it burns!
let me in, pike!  I am hungry!
get away from here.
I am hungry.
i mean it.
he was slow.  very simple.  they will not all be that easy.
fine.
and the alley was a mistake.  never corner yourself like that.  if they would come at you in force you would be dead now.  one vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
does the world 'duhh' mean anything to you?
you felt a little sick, did not you? the cramps.
nice conversationalist!  yeah, i felt 'em a little, but i am not due for two weeks since you are so excited about the subject.
it is natural.  a reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it.  it is part of how you are able to track them.
oh, wonderful.  my secret weapon is - pms.  that is just great.  thanks for telling me.
you will get used to it.  I am more worried about your tactical mistakes.
you are such a wet.
a what?
a wet!  did not i just kill that vampire?  i think i did.  i did not see you killing any vampires.  you were too busy playing 'beat the clock'.
do not start with me again.
are not i, like the chosen one?  the one and only?  the grand high poobah and does not that mean you have to be nice to me?  like, ever?
buffy...
and why are you always wearing black? it is so down.  it is totally not your color.  i do not think you have a color.
what do you want?  encouragement?  'gosh, buffy, you are so special, i just want to give you a great big hug, oh I am just having a warm fuzzy.'
oh, fuck you!
do you know how many girls I have trained to be slayers?  five.  five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you have ever worked in your life -- and i saw them ripped apart.  do you want to live?  do you?
i...
what did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a slayer?
five?
five.
so, basically, I have got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
not if you are careful.
how can you keep doing this?
it is what i was raised to do.  there are not many of us left, the watchers.
watchers?
there is a small village in hampshire, near stonehenge...  ... near a bunch of big rocks. that is where i was born.  my father taught me about the training, about finding the slayers, reading the signs.  there is a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we are just a bunch of harmless old loonies.  i thought so myself for a time, when i was younger...  I am sorry.  I am not supposed to... i should not go on like this.
i wish you would.
it is not important.
I am curious, is all.
buffy, don't... do not start thinking of me as your friend.  it interferes with the work, and it...
and it makes it worse when i die, right?
well, you know, I am not going to kick so easy.  I have got a few things the other girls did not have.
as for example, what?
well... there is my keen fashion sense, for one.
vampires of the world, beware.
merrick.  you made a joke.  are you okay, i mean, do you want to lie down?  i know it hurts the first time.
so they found cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels.  nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something.  like dealing.
well, i hope so.
probably was.  what do you suppose she was doing out there.
dying.
eeyuu.
... and they are having some memorial service or something tomorrow.  you going?
i do not know.  coach said i had to work on my 'ab's.'
coach knows what abs are?
whoa!  whoa!  I am sorry.  I am sorry. i do not actually need any right now.
what is with you?
do not grab me, okay?
absolutely.  i see now the error of my mistake.
i can take care of myself, jeffrey.
so i noticed.
nice to feel needed.
let's move out!
yes!
i mean, most of the time jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'me-tarzan'ish, you know what i mean?  lately it bugs me, i guess.  merrick?  are you still breathing?
i can not work this.
we call them zippers.  they are not supposed to be a challenge.
but it is in the back.  why are we wasting time with this, anyway?
because you clash, merrick.  you clash with everything.  i mean you might as well go around with a sign, 'slayers trained her.'  honestly, you look like something out of... pasadena.
my clothes have always been perfectly serviceable.
well, you are on my turf now.  you are just going to have to trust me.
i want to die.
okay.  the important thing is not to panic.
what nasty bug crawled up your bungus and where the hell are you going?
I am leaving, man.  I am bailing town. this place has gotten way too hairy.
where am i gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
hey, have you seen benny lately?
no...  you want me to give him a message?
you should think about leaving, too, man.  sell this place... something is going on here.  i do not know.  something real weird.
ah, you will be coming back.
i do not think so.
all right.  take care of yourself.
i am.
hey.  what should i do if i see benny?
run.
hi.
hi there.
is that your car?
it was.  i think it is pretty much ready for the --
interesting.
i kind of had to improvise.  sorry about your guitar.
what is wrong with you!?!
my arm!  he took my fucking arm!
shut up!  you let him have it!
you reckless imbecile.  this place is ours for the taking and you let yourself... twelve hundred years old and you act like a child.
i had him in my grasp.
cheer up.  you may still.
i look horrible.
the other two -- the new ones. where are they?
i do not know.  but the boy, he could not kill them.
no... not a boy...  find out if they are dead.  and do something about that arm.  honestly, i do not know how you made it through the crusades.
how are you doing?
oh, I am good.  I am good.  kind of miss my knees, though.
you want some water or something?
water.  okay.
do you do this kind of thing a lot? i mean, is this like a hobby?
not exactly.
they were vampires, were not they?
yeah.
god!  unbelievable.  vampires.
you had a car full of stuff.  were you leaving?
yeah, i was bailing.  i have a friend, and he is really... well, he is really vampire, i guess.  bad scene.
well, stay here tonight.
thanks.  tomorrow morning, I am on a bus.  I am gone.
where are you gonna go?
well, I have always wanted to see oxnard.
hey, jeez are you okay?  you need a hand?
it is nothing.  it does not hurt.
things are kind of confusing.
I will back that up.
three weeks ago all i thought about was... well, i did not actually think about anything.  i definitely did not expect this.
i know.  my guidance counselor never mentioned anything about vampires. 'prison' came up a few times, but nothing about undead.
it is weird.  i went back to my old grade school once, to the playground -- i used to hang out there all the time, playing on the swings and stuff... i went back and it was so tiny, the whole place.  i could not even fit on the swings.  everything just looked so small.  I am sorry.  I am babbling.
no, you are not.
I am kinda beat.  you can stay in my mom's room if you want.
i think I will just hang out here. make sure the sun comes up and everything.
you sure?
oh, I will be fine.  got my chair, got my window, I am great.
mmkay.
hey, buffy...
yeah?
you know, you saved my life.  and i just wanted to say... i forgive you for talking during the movie. almost.
there is not time.
make time, okay?  you are the one who told me to act normal.  I have missed three practices already.  if I am not there for the barber game tomorrow everyone's going to talk.
another distraction.  it is not right.
why because it is not my fate?  it is not in the book-of-all- knowledgefullness that I am going to be cheerleading at the barber game?
sooner or later you are going to have to accept it.  your fate.
I am pretty much learning not to accept anything anymore.  come on, merrick.  football.  afterwards we can kill and kill until there is nothing left.
all right.
toasty.  you should come; it is going to be a great game.
oh, I will be there all right.  I am not letting you out of my sight. not till you are ready.
try and be inconspicuous, okay? act like a fan.
football is my life.
you are learning.  slowly, incredibly slowly, but you are learning.
none of the other girls ever gave me this much trouble.
and where are they now?
so that is your tutor, huh?  what is he, like, your boyfriend now?
jeffrey.  projectile vomit.
buffy, jesus!  you know these steps.
sorry.
buffy!
what is she...
wait!
he knows who i am!
i did not expect to see you.
i know.
why did you come back?
i do not know.  i kind of thought i ought to be here.  you know, this is not exactly the kind of thing you can run away from.
thanks.
besides, oxnard sucks.
pike, i do not think you are up to this.
i think i could help.  you going to tell me you do not need help?
did you see a girl come by here?
you do not mean, like, a cheerleader?
yes.
yeah, i saw her.  bitch took my wheels.
wheels?
my bike!  she is a lesbian, too. she told me.
which way did she go?
down there.
buffy?  what is wrong?
oh, god.  it is him.  i think it is him.
who?
merrick...
i got all the plastic stuff.  what should i do with it?
throw it out.
i really was way way too too.
oh, please!  when she ran onto the field in the middle of the game? was that the most out-of-it thing ever, or did i blink?
i'm, like, yelling at her, 'what are you doing?'  and she is going 'jeffrey, jeffrey!'  way mental.
hi, buffy.
hi, guys.
you were supposed to be here at three.
i forgot.
buffy, what is your sitch?  you are acting like the thing from another tax-bracket; it is too weird.
look, a lot's been going on.  that is what i wanted to tell you guys about. i need to tell you.  you see... a while ago, i met this guy --
oh my god you are having an affair.
cool!
does jeffrey know?
what are you talking about?
weird?  you mean like you hanging out with that homeless, poke?  i saw you last night after the game.
pike.
you are having a fling with him?
he does not look fifty.
guys.  guys!  reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
oh, thank you very much.
like you have got a grip.
you are so out of it.  you have blown off cheerleading, you have blown off dance committee --
excuse me for having something important to do.
this is not important?  the earth is our home.
kimberly, it is a dance.  it is a stupid dance with a bunch of stupid kids that i see every stupid day.
so, we are stupid now?
you know, just because you are having full-on wiggans does not mean you have to drag us into it.  this is not just any dance.  it happens ot be the last dance of our last year.
except for prom.
right.
and spring fling.
okay.
and the january semi-formal --
okay!  look, buffy.  you want to play house with the unwashed masses, that is fine.  but personally, i think you ought to spend a little time prioritizing.  i really do.
listen to you.  what language are you speaking?
get out of my facial.
well, i guess you got what you came for.
nicole...
later for it.
buffy, honey?
yeah?
have you gained a few pounds?  maybe it is that outfit...
maybe.
what is bobby going to say?
i do not know, mom; I have never met bobby.
are not we the chatty ones.  kiss noise.
i been working on some stuff for you.  what'cha doing?
I am going shopping.  do not try to stop me.
cool.  i could actually use a couple of allen wrenches.  what do you need?
a dress.
dress, huh?  what for?
for the dance.
come again?
I am going to the senior dance.
second word... sound like 'dance'.
I am going to the dance.
what for?
in order to dance and to drink punch and to be with my friends. comprende?
i do not believe this.  the world's under attack by the legions of the undead and you are going to a mixer?
it is not a mixer.  it is the senior dance.  and it is important.  you would not understand.
you got that right.  i thought you wanted to kill vampires.
i do not want to kill anybody, and i do not want to talk about it anymore.
listen, i know you are bummed about your friend, and I am really sorry...
he did what he was supposed to.
but, buffy, you are the guy, the chosen guy.
right.  I am the chosen one.  and i choose to be shopping.
i should have known.
leave me alone.
benny was right.  you guys are all exactly the same.
buffy!  looking tasty.
thanks.  have you seen jeffrey?
hi, guys.
hi.
have you guys seen jeffrey?  the limo never showed, i thought he might be here.
i have not seen him tonight.
oh.
I am glad you guys are here.  it is good to see you.
yeah, whoops i came.
you look way pretty, kim.
i know.  i like your little outfit.
it is amazing what you can do with a parachute and some starch.
as long as there is room for three in it.  what, did not you bring your new friends?
buffy, what are you doing here?
i thought we were meeting here.
I am here with jenny.
i do not understand.
oh, come on, buffy.  you know what is going on.  it is not working out at all.  I have got to move on.  i mean, I have got needs, too.  i told you about all this.
no, you didn't.  when?
did not you get my message?
you broke up with my machine?
you were not home.  like always.
you left me a message?
I am out of here.  jenny.
i crashed your party.
pretty shallow of you.
that is me.
I am glad you came.
yeah, you look like you are having a swell time.
will i get the shit kicked out of me if i ask you to dance?
i do not actually think jeffrey's going to notice.
they will kill us!
you want some punch?
I am going out the front.
are you nuts, buffy?  there is a hundred of them out there.  they will rip us apart.
you are staying here.  some of them might not come after me.  if they do not this place is going to turn into a total stain.
you say that like it is a bad thing.
buffy, this is crazy.  what do these guys want?
andy, start breaking up some chairs. you will need weapons.
good thing one of us was prepared.
buffy, there is no way you are going out there alone.
oh, yes!  yes!
oh, baby!
make me a woman!  yes!  make me a woman!
buffy?
jeffrey!
well, I am done.  are you done?
no --
okay, let's go.
but --
ah, my fool is dead.  he was careless, always.  still, I will pull out your tongue for that.  do not you understand?  I have killed you a dozen times.  your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath.  i have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes.  a thousand years, and more. i have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and i have bathed in the blood of emperors.
have you ever thrown up in the front row of a richard marx concert?
what?
you are even weaker than the others.
i think you have forgotten something.
this?  this is you only weapon? your puny faith?
no...
are you okay?
get away from me!
i am a god!  a god!
i am so sure.
she was even crazier after that.  i mean it, you would not even have recognized her.
buffy?
she did not even hardly talk to anyone in school.  all year.  she did not even go to the prom.
i heard she got straight a's.
i did not say it was a bad idea, i just said the timing was off.  we could maybe wait till later.
do not be such a fraidy-cat.
who is afraid?  besides me, i mean.
we have come all this way.  we just have to check it out.  i got a hunch.
you are the boss, boss.  i just thought maybe we should wait.
