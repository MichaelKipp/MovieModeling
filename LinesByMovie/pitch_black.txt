why did i fall on you?
he is dead. cap'n's dead. christ, i was looking right at him when --
i mean, i mean, chrono shows we are 22 weeks out, so gravity was not supposed to kick in for another 19. i mean, i mean, i mean, why did i fall at all?
you hear me? captain's dead. owens too.
oh, no. not owens, not.... wai', wai', wait. i'm owens. right?
1550 millibars, dropping 20 mb per minute, shit, we are hemorrhaging air. somethin' took a swipe at us.
just tell me we are still in the shipping lane. just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
fry?
can not get my nose down...too much load back there....
you mean that "load" of passengers?
so what, we should both go down too? out of sheer fucking nobility?
look, fry. company says we are responsible for every one of those --
company's not here, is it?
when captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. now they train you for this, so --
and there was not a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! that's how they train you! on a fucking simulator!
owens!
70 seconds! you still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
hey.
hey, who?
hey, me. over here.
amazing. I am johns.
carolyn fry. I would shake hands, but...
...then we saw this.
anyone else having breathing problems? aside from me?
it is the atmosphere. too much pressure, not enough oxygen. might take a few days to --
so what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
somethin' knocked us off-lane. maybe a rogue comet. maybe we will never know.
liquid oxygen canisters inside. start ripping them out. quick hits only -- try to make it last.
well, is someone coming for us? or are we all just going to die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  hey, you do not have to worry about scaring me.
and him?
big evil?
we just keep him locked up forever?
be my choice. already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
i do not need his life story. is he really that dangerous?
only around humans.
well? is it just the pump?
ask if anyone has anything in cargo! anything to drink!
s'matter?
little swamp-flu from the conga system. never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
king tut's tomb....
be surprised what these will fetch in the taurus system. here. this wooten here -- easy, easy. very rare.
this is it? booze? that's what you have to drink?
200-year-old single-malt scotch is to "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."
a toast to whatever he just said.
I will need a receipt for that.  for all these.
i do not suppose....
one of the christian habits we didn't adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. we will have to wait.
for what? there is no water. you understand that, do not you?
all deserts have water, somewhere. god shall lead us there.
what the hell are these?
maratha crow-bill war-picks from northern india. very rare.
an' this?
blow-dart hunting stick from papua new guinea. very very rare, since the tribe's extinct.
'cuz they could not hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
well, what is the need, anyway? if he is gone, he is gone. why should he bother us?
imam. we should leave soon. before nightfall but while it is cooler.
what, you are goin' off, too?
johns is leaving you a gun. just do me a favor, huh? get my crewies buried? they were good guys who died bad.
so much for your nightfall.
so much for my cocktail hour.
a very good sign.  that is riddick's direction. you do not wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
thought you found his restraints over there. toward sunset.
which means he went toward sunrise.
so quiet. you get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
you know who muhammad was?
some prophet guy?
"some prophet guy." and a city man. but he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of god.
you were on a pilgrimage? to new mecca?
chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. to know god, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
frightening thought.
we are all on the same hajj now.
what?
tell me it is not a mirage.
amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. do not want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
probably makes it worse. dehydrates you even more.
probably right.
no, no, i wanted to get away.
so i noticed. never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
better keep moving....
what did owens mean? 'bout not touching the switch?
hey. you can tell me, carolyn.
promise me. swear to me you will not --
you see anybody else here? just between you and me.
during the landing...when things were at their worst...owens was at his best. he is the one who would not let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
so now you know.
fuck. guess I am more glad to be here than i thought.
did not bite.
what?
thought he might be coolin' it in the boneyard -- could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us. so i left the bottle out as bait.
"god is great," yes?
I am born-again.
audrey? oh, audrey....
what?
tell me that was you.
okay, it was me. what did i do now?
assailing my fragile sense of security, that is what.
oh, lord....
it was just somebody else. from the crash. he was just....
no juice, looks like it is been laid up for years. but we might be able to adapt --
shut up.
sorry. thought i heard something.
like what?
like my pistola.
...i do not play that...i do not play that so just try again. c'mon, riddick, tell me a better lie....
ease up, ease up. johns! just tell me what....
he used that?
sir shiv-a-lot. he likes to cut.
so why is not it all bloody?
i assume he licked it clean.
tell me about the sounds. you told them you heard something right before....  if you do not talk to me, johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
'mean the whispers?
what whispers?
the ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. the abdominal aorta. what a gusher. had a cup on his belt, so i used it to catch a little run-off. metallic taste to it, human blood. coppery. but if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. course, that is more for winter. summertime, i take mine straight.
all you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I would take that as a compliment -- but it am not me you got to worry about now.
show me your eyes.
you did this? to yourself?
slam doctor. well, we called him "doctor."
heard about it. just never seen it.
fairly fuckin' ironic, would not you say? slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. three ass-kick suns.  maybe i did do a few people. but not this one. no ma'am, not this time.
then where is he? he is not in the hole. we looked.
look deeper.
i know what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he is trying to --
let's just be sure.
i am sure. look, murders aside, riddick belongs in the asshole hall of fame. he loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that is all he has. and you are playing right into --
we're going to find the body, johns. christ, you are a cop. why am i tellin' you this? we got to go down and find it.
well, do not ask me to.
thought you did not believe his story.
i don't. but that ground looked none too stable, and i do not want anyone --
nobody else is going down but me, okay?
hey. bein' ballsy with your life now does not change what came before -- it is just stupid.
what, you think I am doin' this to prove something?
you said it, not me. let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
thanks for the tip, johns.
we got you...it's okay, it is okay...we got you now....
the child heard you before any of us could even....
one is all?
for now.
found somethin' worse than me, huh?
we are movin'. and I am just wondering if i should not lighten the load right now.
want you to remember this moment, riddick. the way it coulda gone and didn't.
say that again.
here's the deal. you work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. you help us get off this rock....
for what? the honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
truth is, riddick, I am tired of this head-up shit. i wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.
you would cut me loose, boss?
only if we both get outta this alive. and there may be a way.
my recommendation: do me. do not take the chance that I will get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. ghost me, riddick. would if i were you.
if you were me, I would kill us both. c'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
so just like that. wave your little wand and he is one of us now.
did not say that. but least this way i do not have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
little ratty-ass.
nothing we can not repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
not a star-jumper.
does not need to be. use this to get back up to the sol-track shipping lanes, stick out a thumb. you will get picked up.  right?
okay, that should buy us a sys-check. but we will need more cells.
how many?
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. five total to launch.
25 kilos each, huh?
well, just a skiff. disposable, really.
like an emergency life-raft, right?
what, you do not really think they left with their clothes on the lines? photos on the walls?
maybe they had weight limits, you do not know.
i know you do not uncrate your emergency ship unless there is a fucking emergency.
rag it, riddick. nobody wants your theories on --
so what happened? where are they, then?
has anyone seen the young one? ali?
has anyone checked the coring room?
you were tryin' to kill him too.
just wanted his o-2.  though i notice he tried to ghost my ass. when he shot up that stranger instead.
take it.
what, it is broken?
startin' to acclimate, anyhow. take it.
let's board this up and get the hell gone. they seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --
60 years ago.
wha'?
are you fuckin' kidding me?
not afraid of the dark, are you?
...need those cells from the crash ship. shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
let's wait on the power cells.
wait for what? until it is so dark we can not even find our way back to --
we are not sure when it happens, so let's not --
get the fucking cells over here, johns. what is the discussion?
he can pilot?
hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore i tracked him down.
okay, maybe that is a good thing. maybe i can use him to help with --
he also figured out how to kill the pilot, fry.
you said we were going to trust him now. you said there was a deal.
that is what i said.
oh, this is a dangerous game you are playing, johns.
may have noticed chains do not work on this guy. only way we are truly safe is if he believes he is goin' free. but if he stops believin' --
you mean, if he learns that you are going to royally fuck him over.
-- we need a fail-safe. bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we know we are ready to launch.
you know, he has not harmed any of us. far as i can tell, he has not even lied to us. just stick to the deal, johns. let him go if that is what it --
he is a murderer. the law says he is got to do his bid.
dancin' on razor blades here...
i will not give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
power cells.
they are coming.
strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
i got the quick-and-ugly version.
an' now you are worried about a repeat of history?
entered our minds.
i asked what you thought.
you scare me, riddick. that is what you wanna hear, is not it? there, i admit it, can i get back to work now?
why, what did you hear?
well, guess if it was trickeration he would just do me, huh? then again...i am worth twice as much alive.  did not know? johns am not a cop. oh, he is got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he is just a merc and I am just a payday. that is why he will not kill me. the creed is greed.
you are not a real cop, are you? just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
i never said i was.
never said you were a hype, either.
you have a little caffeine in the morning, i have a little morphine. so what?
and here you got two mornings every day. wow, were you born lucky?
not a problem unless you are going to make --
you made it a problem when you let owens die like that. when you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
owens was already dead. his brain just had not caught on to that fact.
anything else we should know about you, johns? christ, here i am lettin' you play games with our lives when --
my first run-in with riddick. went for the sweet-spot and missed. they had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. i can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  so maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
you coulda helped. and you didn't.
what do my eyes see?
it is starting....
do not wanna miss this.
lookit. lookit!
just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
i saw the cut-marks on the bones. was not a natural die-off.
quiet, please. everyone.
I would rather piss glass.
well, you got the big gauge.
wanna rag your fat mouth?
very big beads.
not staying in here another....
christ, you do not know what is out there!
i know what is in here!
hasan?
riddick?
stop it, stop it, stop it!
'sokay, 'sokay. i killed it.
there....
like the light is scalding it.
it hurts them. light actually hurts them....
...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...i think two more....
spirits. anything over 45 proof burns well.
how many bottles?
not sure. ten?
those umbrellas, the ones that mist. would they burn?  if you got a receipt?
possibly.
awright. so maybe we will have enough light.
oh, lady. if you are in your right mind, i pray you go insane.
we can stick to the plan. if we get four cells back to the skiff, we are off this rock.
i hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat will not run at night.
we will have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
you mean...tonight? with all those things still out there?
oh, sure. why not? sounds like a hoot.
i had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. that there would be...a lasting darkness.
those suns gotta come back sometime. and if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.
look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. how scared is she gonna be out there?
oh, do not use her like that, for a smoke screen.
smoke screen for what?
for your own fear.
hey. why do not you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that does not involve mass suicide?
how much you weigh, johns?
what the hell's it matter?
how much?
79 kilos.
because you are 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and that's why you can not come up with a better plan.
think about that reward, johns.
I am willing to take a cut in pay.
how 'bout a cut in your gut?
oh, trash baby, you are going to regret this.
please...this solves nothing...please....
they are afraid of our light. that means we do not have to be so afraid of them.
and you are certain you can find the way back? even in the dark?
no, I am not. but he can.
fuck me. you said "clear."
said "looks clear."
well, what is it look like now?
looks clear.
he will lead you over the first cliff. you know that, do not you?
we are just burnin' light here.
you give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. he will leave you all out there to die.
i do not get it, johns. what is so goddamn valuable in your life that you are worried about losing? huh? is there anything at all? besides your next hype?  got no right to be so scared. neither one of us.
riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. just in case, you know, this actually --
had it with deals.
but i just wanted to say --
nobody's going to turn a murderer loose. i fuckin' knew better.
been a long time since anyone's trusted me. that is somethin' right there.
we can, can not we? trust you?
actually...  that is what i been askin' myself.
so you noticed too?
riddick. riddick.
where are the sand-cat tracks? why are not we still following them?
saw something i did not like.
such as.
hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. thought we would swing wide. okay by you?
let's move.  just a detour. he will get us there.
can we switch?
what, switch what?
i think i twisted my ankle running backwards like that. and I am not sure i can....  okay, that is a lie. i just do not want to be alone back there anymore. if you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
she is the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
oh, so I am disposable?
what do you see? riddick?
hunger. i see 60 years of hunger.
bottle-count.
four fulls, one half. that mean we are halfway there? i hope?
we are not completely stupid.
stay in the light! everybody! stay in the fucking --
we crossed our own tracks.
he is running us 'round in circles. look for yourself. look!
riddick? what the hell are you --
listen.
canyon ahead. i circled once to buy some time to think.
think about what?
about how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. goddamnit, we are just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
about the girl.
what about her?
what it is going to be like when we hit that canyon. with her bleeding.
what are you jaw-jackin' about? girl's not cut.
no. she is not.
i did not want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why i did not say anything....
no, we would never....oh, god, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
aw, this can not be happening to me....
they been nose-open for her ever since we left. they go off blood.
well...we must keep her close, then. here, she will be safe if we put her between --
there is no "safe."
hey, you're the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. an' now you 'spect me to go back like a whipped dog?
i was wrong. i admit it. my bad, okay? now let's just go back to the ship.
i dunno. nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, I am startin' to enjoy myself out here.
are you fucking high again? just listen to --
no, no, you are right, fry. what is to be afraid of? my life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. so i say mush on! canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we are in skiff city! so why do not you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get --
she is the captain, we should listen to --
listen to her? her? when she was willing to sacrifice us all?
this does not help us, johns.
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
just shut up, okay?
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. paris had it right -- we are disposable. we are just walking ghosts to her.
would you rag your stupid hole!
we cannot go through there....
how much you weigh right now, fry? huh?
am not all of us going to make it.
just realized that, huh?
six of us left. if we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that would be quite a fucking feat, huh? a good thing, right?
not if I am the one.
what if you are one of five?
look, it is hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. it is called "triage," okay?
kept calling it "murder" when i did it.
either way, figure it is something you can grab onto.
sacrifice play. hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. like a bucket of chum.
trawl with it. there is a cable on the sled. we can drag the body behind us.
nice embellishment.
do not wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
so which one caught your eye?
don' look, don' look, don' look....
imam. slow down.
what?
do not stop, just slow down.  little more space 'tween us and them.
i would rather we all stay--
do what i say. please.
what is her name, anyway?
what do you care?
then let's not name the thanksgiving turkey, okay? i assume you still got a shiv.
what, you 'spect me to do it?
what is one more to you? like this is the one that sends you to hell?
oh, you are a piece of art, johns. they oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
aw, do not tell me you are growin' scruples.
just wonderin' if we do not need a bigger piece of chum.
like who, mr. chrislam?
bring the light!
what are they doing? what are we --
leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
back to the ship, huh?
get out of our way.
so everybody huddles together till the lights burn out? until you can not see what is eating you? that the big plan?
where is mr. johns?
which half?
you mean....
gonna lose everybody out here....
he died fast. and if we got any choice, that is the way we should all go out.  do not you cry for johns. do not you dare.
how many you see?
one or two.
audrey?
three full bottles. but almost time to refill.
does not seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
the sled as a shield....
and what about the cells?
we are just here to carry your light, are not we? just the torch-bearers.
let's drop back an' boot up.
what are you doin'?
blessing you like the others.  it is painless.
and pointless.
i see. well, even if you do not believe in god, it does not mean he will not be --
you don't see.
'cuz you do not spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. and you surely do not start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. oh, absolutely i believe in god. and i absolutely hate the fucker.
he will be with us. nonetheless.
give my blessing to the girl. she needs a spare.
as fast as you can.
you sure you can keep --
as fast as you can.
what? what is it?
it is a fucking staircase! go over it! go over it!
suleiman!
get the girl back under. keep going.
suleiman!
keep going or i will!
oh, no. no, no, no....
rain.
so where the hell's god now, huh?  I will tell you where! he is up there pissing on me!
riddick? how close?
tell me the settlement is right there! riddick, please!
we can not make it.
strong survival instinct. admire that in a woman.
you are not leaving. not until we go back for the others.
i promised them we would go back with more light. and that is exactly what we are going to do..
think you have mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
what, you are afraid?
confusin' me with johns now -- fear was his monkey. i only deal in life and death. all that stuff in between? some shade of grey my eyes do not see.
i trusted you, riddick. goddamn, i trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
truthfully? i would not know how.
just come with me!
got a better idea. come with me.
they are already dead. get on board.
you are fuckin' with me. i know you are.
'course i am -- but does not mean i will not leave you here. if you believe anything about me, better be that.
no, you see, i promised them...i have to...i have to go and....
step aboard, carolyn.
i can't....i can't....
here. make it easy on you.
do not do this to me....
just give me your hand.
but they...they could still be....
no one's going to blame you. c'mon. take my hand and save yourself, carolyn.
you would die for them?
i would try for them.
you barely know them.
but I am human. i know you view that as a weakness, but I am sorry -- i do feel fear, theirs too. goddamnit, riddick -- yes. i would die for them.
you came for us....
yeah, yeah -- we are all fuckin' amazed. anyone not ready for this?
probably okay to talk to me now.
not sure where to go. i was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  where you goin'?
not sure. i was just runnin' away when this whole thing....
new mecca....
think a soul could get lost there? with all those pilgrim-types?
it is more a place where souls are found, mr. riddick.
