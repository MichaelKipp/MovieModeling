why did i fall on you?
he's dead. cap'n's dead. christ, i was looking right at him when --
i mean, i mean, chrono shows we're 22 weeks out, so gravity wasn't supposed to kick in for another 19. i mean, i mean, i mean, why did i fall <u>at all</u>?
you hear me? captain's dead. owens too.
oh, no. not owens, not.... wai', wai', wait. <u>i'm owens</u>. right?
1550 millibars, dropping 20 mb per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
fry?
can't get my nose down...too much load back there....
you mean that "load" of passengers?
so what, we should both go down too? out of sheer fucking nobility?
look, fry. company says we're responsible for every one of those --
company's not here, is it?
when captain went down, you stepped up -- whether you like it or not. now they train you for this, so --
and there wasn't a simulated cockroach alive within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! <u>that's</u> how they train you! on a fucking simulator!
owens!
70 seconds! you still got 70 seconds to level this beast out!
hey.
hey, who?
hey, me. over here.
amazing. i'm johns.
carolyn fry. i'd shake hands, but...
...then we saw this.
anyone else having breathing problems? aside from me?
it's the atmosphere. too much pressure, not enough oxygen. might take a few days to --
so what the bloody hell happened, anyways?
somethin' knocked us off-lane. maybe a rogue comet. maybe we'll never know.
liquid oxygen canisters inside. start ripping them out. quick hits only -- try to make it last.
well, is someone coming for us? or are we all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even something worse?  hey, you don't have to worry about scaring me.
and him?
big evil?
we just keep him locked up forever?
be my choice. already escaped once from the max-slam facility on --
i don't need his life story. is he really that dangerous?
only around humans.
well? is it just the pump?
ask if anyone has anything in cargo! anything to drink!
s'matter?
little swamp-flu from the conga system. never shook it with all this cryo-sleep.
king tut's tomb....
be surprised what these will fetch in the taurus system. here. this wooten here -- easy, easy. very rare.
this is it? booze? <u>that's</u> what you have to drink?
200-year-old single-malt scotch is to "booze" as foie gras is to "duck guts."
a toast to whatever he just said.
i'll need a receipt for that.  for all these.
i don't suppose....
one of the christian habits we <u>didn't</u> adopt -- perhaps unfortunately. we'll have to wait.
for what? there is no water. you understand that, don't you?
all deserts have water, somewhere. god shall lead us there.
what the hell are these?
maratha crow-bill war-picks from northern india. very rare.
an' this?
blow-dart hunting stick from papua new guinea. very <u>very</u> rare, since the tribe's extinct.
'cuz they couldn't hunt shit with these things, be my guess.
well, what's the need, anyway? if he's gone, he's gone. why should he bother us?
imam. we should leave soon. before nightfall but while it's cooler.
what, you're goin' off, too?
johns is leaving you a gun. just do me a favor, huh? get my crewies buried? they were good guys who died bad.
so much for your nightfall.
so much for my cocktail hour.
a very good sign.  that's riddick's direction. you do <u>not</u> wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.
thought you found his restraints over there. toward sunset.
which means he went toward sunrise.
so quiet. you get used to the sounds of the ship, then....
you know who muhammad was?
some prophet guy?
"some prophet guy." and a city man. but he had to travel to the desert -- where there was quiet -- to hear the words of god.
you were on a pilgrimage? to new mecca?
chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime should there be a great hajj -- a great pilgrimage. to know god, better, yes, but to know yourself as well.
frightening thought.
we're all on the same hajj now.
what?
tell me it's not a mirage.
amazing how you can do without the essentials of life -- so long as you have the luxuries.
well, just keep your bloody-fuckin' eyes open. don't want that ratbag sneakin' up on me bloody-fuckin' arse.
probably makes it worse. dehydrates you even more.
probably right.
no, no, i wanted to get away.
so i noticed. never seen a "captain" quite so ready to leave her ship.
better keep moving....
what'd owens mean? 'bout not touching the switch?
hey. you can tell me, carolyn.
promise me. swear to me you won't --
you see anybody else here? just between you and me.
during the landing...when things were at their worst...owens was at his best. he's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
so now you know.
fuck. guess i'm more glad to be here than i thought.
didn't bite.
what?
thought he might be coolin' it in the boneyard -- could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us. so i left the bottle out as bait.
"god is great," yes?
i'm born-again.
audrey? oh, audrey....
<u>what</u>?
tell me that was you.
okay, it was me. what'd i do now?
assailing my fragile sense of security, that's what.
oh, lord....
it was just somebody else. from the crash. he was just....
no juice, looks like it's been laid up for years. but we might be able to adapt --
shut up.
sorry. thought i heard something.
like what?
like my pistola.
...i don't play that...i don't play that so just try again. c'mon, riddick, tell me a better lie....
ease up, ease up. johns! just tell me what....
he used that?
sir shiv-a-lot. he likes to cut.
so why isn't it all bloody?
i assume he licked it clean.
tell me about the sounds. you told them you heard something right before....  if you don't talk to me, johns'll take another crack at it -- at your skull.
'mean the whispers?
what whispers?
the ones tellin' me to go for the sweet spot -- just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. the abdominal aorta. what a gusher. had a cup on his belt, so i used it to catch a little run-off. metallic taste to it, human blood. coppery. but if you cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. course, that's more for winter. summertime, i take mine straight.
all you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, i'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
show me your eyes.
you did this? to yourself?
slam doctor. well, we called him "doctor."
heard about it. just never seen it.
fairly fuckin' ironic, wouldn't you say? slamlight's so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and shined up -- then you wind up here. three ass-kick suns.  maybe i did do a few people. but not this one. no ma'am, not this time.
then where is he? he's not in the hole. we looked.
look deeper.
i <u>know</u> what happened -- he went off on the guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he's trying to --
let's just be sure.
i <u>am</u> sure. look, murders aside, riddick belongs in the asshole hall of fame. he loves the jaw-jackin', loves making you afraid, 'cuz that's all he has. and you're playing right into --
<u>we're gonna find the body</u>, johns. christ, you're a cop. why am i tellin' you this? we gotta go down and find it.
well, don't ask me to.
thought you didn't believe his story.
i don't. but that ground looked none too stable, and i don't want anyone --
nobody else is going down but me, okay?
hey. bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
what, you think i'm doin' this to prove something?
you said it, not me. let's just not let one bad call lead to another.
thanks for the tip, johns.
we got you...it's okay, it's okay...we got you now....
the child heard you before any of us could even....
one is all?
for now.
found somethin' worse than me, huh?
we're movin'. and i'm just wondering if i shouldn't lighten the load right now.
want you to remember this moment, riddick. the way it coulda gone and didn't.
say that again.
here's the deal. you work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. you help us get off this rock....
for what? the honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
truth is, riddick, i'm tired of this head-up shit. i wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.
you'd cut me loose, boss?
only if we both get outta this alive. and there may be a way.
my recommendation: do me. don't take the chance that i'll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. ghost me, riddick. would if i were you.
if you were me, i'd kill us both. c'mon, you wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?
so just like that. wave your little wand and he's one of us now.
didn't say that. but least this way i don't have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin' up.
little ratty-ass.
nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
not a star-jumper.
doesn't need to be. use this to get back up to the sol-track shipping lanes, stick out a thumb. you'll get picked up.  right?
okay, that should buy us a sys-check. but we'll need more cells.
how many?
15 6-gigs here...90 gigs total...other ship carries 20-gig cells, so...five. five total to launch.
25 kilos each, huh?
well, just a skiff. disposable, really.
like an emergency life-raft, right?
what, you don't really think they left with their clothes on the lines? photos on the walls?
maybe they had weight limits, you don't know.
i know you don't uncrate your emergency ship unless there's a fucking emergency.
rag it, riddick. nobody wants your theories on --
so what happened? where are they, then?
has anyone seen the young one? ali?
has anyone checked the coring room?
you were tryin' to kill him too.
just wanted his o-2.  though i notice he tried to ghost my ass. when he shot up that stranger instead.
take it.
what, it's broken?
startin' to acclimate, anyhow. take it.
let's board this up and get the hell gone. they seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be all --
60 years ago.
wha'?
are you fuckin' kidding me?
not afraid of the dark, are you?
...need those cells from the crash ship. shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
let's wait on the power cells.
wait for what? until it's so dark we can't even find our way back to --
we're not sure <u>when</u> it happens, so let's not --
<u>get the fucking cells over here</u>, johns. what's the discussion?
he can pilot?
hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva good run 'fore i tracked him down.
okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. maybe i can use him to help with --
he also figured out how to kill the pilot, fry.
you said we were going to trust him now. you said there was a deal.
that's what i said.
oh, this is a dangerous game you're playing, johns.
may've noticed chains don't work on this guy. only way we're truly safe is if he believes he's goin' free. but if he <u>stops</u> believin' --
you mean, if he learns that you're gonna royally fuck him over.
-- we need a fail-safe. bring the cells over at the last possible minute -- when the wings are ready, when we <u>know</u> we're ready to launch.
you know, he hasn't harmed any of us. far as i can tell, he hasn't even lied to us. just stick to the deal, johns. let him go if that's what it --
he's a murderer. the law says he's gotta do his bid.
dancin' on razor blades here...
i won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
power cells.
they're coming.
strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
i got the quick-and-ugly version.
an' now you're worried about a repeat of history?
entered our minds.
i asked what <u>you</u> thought.
you scare me, riddick. that's what you wanna hear, isn't it? there, i admit it, can i get back to work now?
why, what'd you hear?
well, guess if it was trickeration he'd just do me, huh? then again...i am worth twice as much alive.  didn't know? johns ain't a cop. oh, he's got that shiny badge an' all, but nah -- he's just a merc and i'm just a payday. that's why he won't kill me. the creed is greed.
you're not a real cop, are you? just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
i never said i was.
never said you were a hype, either.
you have a little caffeine in the morning, i have a little morphine. so what?
and here you got two mornings every day. wow, were you <u>born</u> lucky?
not a problem unless you're gonna make --
<u>you</u> made it a problem when you let owens die like that. when you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking mule-team.
owens was already dead. his brain just hadn't caught on to that fact.
anything <u>else</u> we should know about you, johns? christ, here i am lettin' you play games with our lives when --
my first run-in with riddick. went for the sweet-spot and missed. they had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. i can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord.  so maybe the care and feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.
you coulda helped. and you didn't.
what do my eyes see?
it's starting....
don't wanna miss this.
lookit. lookit!
just a suggestion, but perhaps we should flee.
cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo, lesgo, lesgo.
i saw the cut-marks on the bones. wasn't a natural die-off.
quiet, please. everyone.
i'd rather piss glass.
well, you got the big gauge.
wanna rag your fat mouth?
very big beads.
not staying in here another....
christ, you don't know what's out there!
i know what's in here!
hasan?
riddick?
stop it, stop it, stop it!
'sokay, 'sokay. i killed it.
there....
like the light is scalding it.
it hurts them. light actually hurts them....
...one cutting torch...one handlight here, two more in the cabin...i <u>think</u> two more....
spirits. anything over 45 proof burns well.
how many bottles?
not sure. ten?
those umbrellas, the ones that mist. would they burn?  if you got a receipt?
possibly.
awright. so maybe we'll have enough light.
oh, lady. if you're in your right mind, i pray you go insane.
we can stick to the plan. if we get four cells back to the skiff, we're off this rock.
i hate to kill a beautiful theory with an ugly fact, but that sand-cat won't run at night.
we'll have to carry the cells...drag them...whatever it takes.
you mean...tonight? with all those things still out there?
oh, sure. why not? sounds like a hoot.
i had the impression...from the model... that the two planets were moving as one. that there would be...a lasting darkness.
those suns gotta come back <u>sometime</u>. and if these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till then.
look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. how scared is she gonna be out there?
oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
smoke screen for what?
for your own fear.
hey. why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve mass suicide?
how much you weigh, johns?
what the hell's it matter?
how much?
79 kilos.
because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and <u>that's</u> why you can't come up with a better plan.
think about that reward, johns.
i'm willing to take a cut in pay.
how 'bout a cut in your gut?
oh, trash baby, you're gonna regret this.
please...this solves nothing...please....
they're afraid of our light. that means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
and you're certain you can find the way back? even in the dark?
no, i'm not. but <u>he</u> can.
<u>fuck me</u>. you said "clear."
said "looks clear."
well, what's it look like now?
looks clear.
he'll lead you over the first cliff. you know that, don't you?
we're just burnin' light here.
you give him the cells and the ship -- and he will leave you. he will leave you all out there to die.
i don't get it, johns. what is so goddamn valuable in your life that you're worried about losing? huh? is there anything at all? besides your next hype?  got no right to be so scared. neither one of us.
riddick...was thinkin' we should make some kind of deal. just in case, you know, this actually --
had it with deals.
but i just wanted to say --
nobody's gonna turn a murderer loose. i fuckin' knew better.
been a long time since anyone's trusted me. that's somethin' right there.
we can, can't we? trust you?
actually...  that's what i been askin' myself.
so you noticed too?
riddick. <u>riddick</u>.
where are the sand-cat tracks? why aren't we still following them?
saw something i didn't like.
such as.
hard to tell, sometimes...even for me... but looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin' each other's gonads off. thought we'd swing wide. okay by you?
let's move.  just a detour. he'll get us there.
can we switch?
what, switch what?
i think i twisted my ankle running backwards like that. and i'm not sure i can....  okay, that's a lie. i just don't want to be alone back there anymore. if you could just give me a few minutes up front here --
she's the pilot, she should stay close to the cells.
oh, so i'm disposable?
what do you see? riddick?
hunger. i see 60 years of hunger.
bottle-count.
four fulls, one half. that mean we're halfway there? i hope?
we aren't completely stupid.
stay in the light! everybody! stay in the fucking --
we crossed our own tracks.
he's running us 'round in circles. look for yourself. look!
riddick? what the hell are you --
<u>listen</u>.
canyon ahead. i circled once to buy some time to think.
think about what?
about how to kill us and still get these cells to the skiff. goddamnit, we're just doin' the heavy lifting for this prick!
about the girl.
what about her?
what it's gonna be like when we hit that canyon. with her bleeding.
what're you jaw-jackin' about? girl's not cut.
no. she's not.
i didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why i didn't say anything....
no, we'd never....oh, god, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
aw, this can't be happening to me....
they been nose-open for her ever since we left. they go off blood.
well...we must keep her close, then. here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
there is no "safe."
hey, <u>you're</u> the one who got me out here, turned me into a goddamn sled dog. an' now you 'spect me to go back like a <u>whipped</u> dog?
i was wrong. i admit it. my bad, okay? now let's just go back to the ship.
i dunno. nice breeze, wide open spaces -- you know, i'm startin' to enjoy myself out here.
are you fucking high again? just listen to --
no, no, you're right, fry. what's to be afraid of? my life is a steamin' pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. so i say mush on! canyon's only couple hundred meters, after that we're in skiff city! so why don't you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid, and get --
she's the captain, we should listen to --
listen to her? <u>her</u>? when she was willing to sacrifice us all?
this does not help us, johns.
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
just shut up, okay?
-- tried to kill us in our sleep. paris had it right -- we <u>are</u> disposable. we're just walking ghosts to her.
would you rag your stupid hole!
we cannot go through there....
how much you weigh right now, fry? huh?
ain't all of us gonna make it.
just realized that, huh?
six of us left. if we could get through that canyon and lose just one, that'd be quite a fucking feat, huh? a good thing, right?
not if i'm the one.
what if you're one of five?
look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. it's called "triage," okay?
kept calling it "murder" when i did it.
either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
sacrifice play. hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. like a bucket of chum.
<u>trawl</u> with it. there's a cable on the sled. we can drag the body behind us.
nice embellishment.
don't wanna feed these land-sharks -- just keep 'em off our scent.
so which one caught your eye?
don' look, don' look, don' look....
imam. slow down.
what?
don't stop, just slow down.  little more space 'tween us and them.
i would rather we all stay--
do what i say. please.
what's her name, anyway?
what do you care?
then let's not name the thanksgiving turkey, okay? i assume you still got a shiv.
what, you 'spect <u>me</u> to do it?
what's one more to you? like <u>this</u> is the one that sends you to hell?
oh, you're a piece of art, johns. they oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. or forget the museum -- maybe they should just hang you.
aw, don't tell me you're growin' scruples.
just wonderin' if we don't need a bigger piece of chum.
like who, mr. chrislam?
bring the light!
what're they doing? what're <u>we</u> --
leave the sled, let's go, go, go!
back to the ship, huh?
get out of our way.
so everybody huddles together till the lights burn out? until you can't see what's eating you? that the big plan?
where's mr. johns?
which half?
you mean....
gonna lose everybody out here....
he died fast. and if we got any choice, that's the way we should all go out.  don't you cry for johns. don't you dare.
how many you see?
one or two.
audrey?
three full bottles. but almost time to refill.
doesn't seem like enough to turn back on, does it?
the sled as a shield....
and what about the cells?
we're just here to carry your light, aren't we? just the torch-bearers.
let's drop back an' boot up.
what're you doin'?
blessing you like the others.  it's painless.
and pointless.
i see. well, even if you don't believe in god, it doesn't mean he won't be --
you <u>don't</u> see.
'cuz you don't spend half your life in lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. and you surely don't start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord wrapped around your neck and not believe. oh, absolutely i believe in god. and i absolutely hate the fucker.
he will be with us. nonetheless.
give my blessing to the girl. she needs a spare.
as fast as you can.
you sure you can keep --
as fast as you can.
what? what is it?
it's a fucking staircase! go over it! go over it!
suleiman!
get the girl back under. keep going.
suleiman!
keep going or i will!
oh, no. no, no, no....
rain.
so where the hell's god now, huh?  i'll tell you where! he's up there pissing on me!
riddick? how close?
tell me the settlement is right there! riddick, please!
we can't make it.
strong survival instinct. admire that in a woman.
you're not leaving. not until we go back for the others.
i promised them we'd go back with more light. and that's exactly what we're gonna do..
think you've mistaken me for somebody who gives a fuck.
what, you're afraid?
confusin' me with johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. i only deal in life and death. all that stuff in between? some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
<u>i trusted you</u>, riddick. goddamn, i trusted that some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.
truthfully? i wouldn't know how.
just come with me!
got a better idea. come with <u>me</u>.
they're already dead. get on board.
you're fuckin' with me. i know you are.
'course i am -- but doesn't mean i won't leave you here. if you believe anything about me, better be that.
no, you see, i <u>promised</u> them...i have to...i have to go and....
step aboard, carolyn.
i can't....i can't....
here. make it easy on you.
don't do this to me....
just give me your hand.
but they...they could still be....
no one's gonna blame you. c'mon. take my hand and save yourself, carolyn.
you'd die for them?
i would try for them.
you barely know them.
but i'm human. i know you view that as a weakness, but i'm sorry -- i <u>do</u> feel fear, theirs too. goddamnit, riddick -- yes. i would die for them.
you came for us....
yeah, yeah -- we're all fuckin' amazed. anyone not ready for this?
probably okay to talk to me now.
not sure where to go. i was just runnin' away when this whole thing started.  where you goin'?
not sure. i was just runnin' away when this whole thing....
new mecca....
think a soul could get lost there? with all those pilgrim-types?
it's more a place where souls are found, mr. riddick.
