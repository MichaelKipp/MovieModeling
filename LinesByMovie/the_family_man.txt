every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
all in one tape?
i also put side two of london calling on there...
i have a bad feeling about this.
about the plane? what do you think its gonna crash? dont say that...
i know weve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to london is the right thing to do. but in my heart... this feels wrong.
dont  go, jack...
you mean dont go at all? what about my internship?
believe me i know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
for us, kate.
right, for us. but...im afraid that if you get on that plane...
what?
go. im sorry, you should just go...
no, youre right.  what are we doing?
we're being responsible.  go. get on the plane.
i can't seem to let go of you...
you hear me complaining about that?
did you really mean what you said about tuscany?
of course i did.
last night was great...
you are an amazing lover.  you should be giving motivational seminars.
thanks.  you're not bad yourself...
i want to see you again.
i'd like that, too.
tonight.
it's christmas eve, jack.
so we'll get egg nog.
i have to go to my parents' house out in jersey.  would you like to come?
jersey?  you know what the traffic's gonna be like?
i'm taking the train...
don't you have anywhere to go?
i've got plenty of places to go.
maybe i can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning...  okay?
if it's something you feel strongly about.
mrs. peterson.
hello jack.  you dont have to stop singing on my account...
its because im shy, betty.  so, when are you going to leave that old corpse mr. peterson and run away with me?
you know you could never satisfy me the way he does...
merry christmas, mr. campbell.
howd you do this year, tony?
about four grand.  and a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from mrs. johnson in 9d.  im putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
just until the deutsche mark turns...
sorry, jack.  i told dee and the kids i'd be home by dinner.  you know, it being christmas eve and all.
is that tonight?
you think i like being here on christmas eve, alan?
i don't know.  maybe...
you're right, jack.  sorry... jack approaches alan.
i don't want you to be sorry, alan, i want you to be excited.  i want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  you know why?
why jack?
because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
you too?  this holiday's about giving, adelle.  and i'm giving everything i've got to this deal, so in a way, i'm more christmassy than anyone...  lifesaver?
you're a ray of sunshine, jack.
oh, and oxxford called...
ooh, my suits are ready...
kate reynolds...
her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
her assistant?
yeah jack, her assistant...
kate reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  i almost married her...
you?  married?
almost married.  and almost a junior broker at e.f. hutton...
excuse me?
she didn't want me to go to london.  we're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
so you left her?  just like that?
god, no.  i thought about it for practically the entire flight...
stop jack, i'm getting all weepy.
i took the road less traveled, adelle.
and look where it's led you...  i'm gonna get her on the phone...
no...
no?!  you almost married this woman.  aren't you even curious what she wants?
she's probably just having a fit of nostalgia.  you know, lonely christmas eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.
peter.  i don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
that's because i'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
and god love you for it.
i just got a call from terry haight.  bob thomas is nervous...
that'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
why are you staring at my breasts, peter?
i need you, tiger..
where is he?
aspen.
hey peter, lemme ask you a question.  an old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on christmas eve...
you suddenly having trouble getting dates?
not by a long shot.
then leave it in the past. old flames are like old tax returns.  you keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
i'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  call the group.  schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
that'll be a nice little holiday treat.
i'm thinking i might walk tonight, frank.
nice night for it.  i'll have louis send your car home.
merry christmas to you, sir...
thanks.  to you too...
...06...14...18...48...right there.  four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  merry christmas and shit...
ticket bad.  you draw in lines with pencil.
what're you talkin' about?
you draw lines with pencil!  i know about this!
what!?  look at the ticket...!
get out, i call 911.
you leave now.  take ticket somewhere else.  next customer in line...!
you first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
get out!
do you wanna die?!
no.
yes you do...
look, i'm talking about a business deal here.  i buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...i just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
like i said, it's a business deal...
damn, you are the real thing...
how'd you know my name was jack?
i call all you white guys "jack."
you know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
there's no way i was gonna die in that deli...  let's just say i've been on a lucky streak lately.
a lucky streak, huh?
so you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe i shouldn't do this, i shoulda done that.
i don't do that.  that's just not for me...
okay, jack.  nice doing business with you... cash is about to take off...
hey...
what do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? you're just gonna do something you'll regret...
you want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
i'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  at a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
yeah, in most cases that'd be true.
i mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
oh man, you're serious...  this man thinks i need to be saved!
everyone needs something.
yeah?  what do you need?
me?
you just said everyone needs something.
i've got everything i need.
wow.  it must be great being you.  you got it all.
look, i'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
you still think this is about me, don't you?
sure it's about you.  but it's about society, too.
oh man, i'm gonna enjoy this one... just remember, jack, you did this.  you brought this on yourself...
rise...and...shine...!
youre jumping, sweetheart...
mom, dont you think we need to open the presents?
mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. that could be her present...
wheres my car?!  wheres my ferrari!?
what the hell are you talking about?  whats he talking about?
look, can i just borrow your car?!  i promise itll be returned!
the caddy?  why dont you take your own damn car!
sorry, pal.  entrance is for residents and guests only...
what are you talking about?  its me, jack campbell.  penthouse c. i put you into commercial paper!
uh-huh...
no...
thank you, betty.  i know if i can just sleep this off, ill be fine...
and sleep you shall. noblesse oblige is not dead.  not yet anyway...come, lets get you some help.  surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
a shelter?!  im the richest guy in the building...ive got twice the square footage you have!
whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
frank.  wheres alan mintz?  is he here yet?
mr. mintz?  i dont think so...buildings closed pal.  youll have to come back tomorrow.
look, i dont know whats going on here but i am senior vice president of this company.
i dont care who you are.  its christmas and like i told you the building is closed.
maybe youre not hearing me.  i am jack campbell...  right here.  jack campbell, president...
miss me, jack?
thats my car!  you stole my car!
its a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
what?!
basically, its my car now.  get in.
might wanna fasten your seat belt, jack...
what the hell is happening to me?!
look, i dont know what youre getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
brought what on myself?! i didnt do anything!
no?  cmon, jack...ive got everything i need, i dont have regrets, thats just not for me... sound familiar?
you mean because you thought i was cocky im now on a permanent acid trip?!!
everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  youre making a business deal...
give me my goddamn life back!
you?  what about me?  im working hard for you here, jack.  on christmas too!  now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  i was moved...
please.  just tell me whats happening to me. in plain english.  none of that mumbo jumbo...
its a glimpse, jacko.
i glimpse?  a glimpse of what!?  what glimpse?! glimpse!
look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of em take a couple seconds...  ...some of em take a lot longer...
i asked you a direct question!  a glimpse of what?!
figure it out.  you got plenty of time.
how much time?!
as long as it takes to figure it out.  which, in your case, could be considerable.
look, i just want my life back.  now whats it gonna take?  you wanna talk turkey?  lets talk turkey!  how much money...?
do i look like i need your money.  it doesnt work like that and i cant tell you why.
why not?
because you got to figure it out for yourself.  are you listening to me?
figure it out?  figure what out?!
thats it?  thats all i get?!  a glare?!
look jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
whats this, a signal? will you come whenever i ring it?
do i look like i live in a bottle?
but what do i do?
look jack im late.  id love to help you out some more but i gotta go handle my business...  happy trails.
i know, i moved the barca-lounger into the corner.  its throwin everybody off.  what do you think?
great room...
were friends, arent we?
maybe i dont say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
im having kind of a bad day.
i read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
what am i saying?  you dont need to hear that...  all i meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, thats all.  is that you?
is it...?
trouble at work?
i dont think so.
its not kate, is it?
you see, its like were in each others heads...
kates my wife...
look, you fit the profile exactly.  thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  you start thinking...this isnt the life i dreamt about.  wheres the romance, wheres the joie de vivre?  suddenly, every lingerie ad in the newark star ledger represents a life you cant have...
its just two kids, right?
are you okay?
yeah...fine.
what kind of man does that!?
i dont know!  please stop yelling at me!
where were you?
i was in the city.
the city?  new york city?  why?
because thats where i live.
jack...dont even start...
look, you dont understand.  i woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
look, we dont have time for this right now, well talk about it later.  now get dressed...  youre not wearing that to the thompsons party. i dont care how hilarious you think it is...
party?  oh no, i cant go to a party...
you look forward to this party all year.  whats with you today?
trust me on this kate.  i really dont think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
what are you doing?
telling my mother she doesnt have to stay with the kids.
why not?
because youll be here.
christ...  where the hell is the bathroom?
funny, jack.  im laughing on the inside.
like the dress...?
its lovely...
i thought i saw you notice it at the kids recital.
finger food...?
i dont think so, thank you...
cmon, as soon as i put them down, youre gonna grab a couple...you always do...
mushroom puffs arent the only thing i do well...
well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. excuse me...
yes, im fine.  its just this god awful football phone!  who has a phone like this anyway?!
uh huh...
jack...
pro bono.  you dont get paid at all.  nobody makes a dime.  well, bravo...
here you go...
youre kidding me...
shes your dog, jack.
no, shes not.
fine, shes the kids dog.  lets go wake josh, see if he wants to walk her.
but its twenty degrees outside...
youre having a bad day, ill go with you...actually, theres no way in hell youre gettin me back out there...
hello!
...my feet are hurtin...
hey!
uh...that babys crying...
and...?
this isnt my real life. its just a glimpse...
wheres my real dad?
i dont know...
they did a pretty good job.
who did?
the aliens...in the mother ship.  you look just like him.
uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
do you like kids?
on a case by case basis...
you know how to make chocolate milk?
i think i could figure it out.
you promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
sure.
this is day care.  its where babies go when their parents are at work.
check...
i have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
five thirty.  okay.
try not to be late because kids dont like to be the last one picked up.
got it.  good tip.
bye...
where do i go now?
big eds.
big eds?  big eds tires?  why...?
thats where you work.
do i have a private office somewhere in the building?
uh...sure jack...  right back there...
thank you.
...i was the number one junior sales associate at e.f. hutton in 1988.  did you know that?
no, i didnt...thats great.
thats the kind of thing you can really build on...
uh huh...
i mean sales has always been a feeder for m and a, always...
here we are, mag wheels...  hey jack, are you sure youre okay?
well, im just a little confused right now about why i work here...
got a minute, jack?
ive got all the time in the world...
cmon jack...
i mean it.  from what i can tell, were a mom and pop operation, were already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
jack.  i said the kids are asleep...
well thats just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
hey!  i was watching that!
i thought we had a deal about you watching cnbc in bed.
im working on a new deal now...
wait a second.  you want me, dont you?
that is the general idea, yes...
shouldnt we grab some dinner first?  maybe a bottle of wine...?
its ten thirty, jack. by eleven youre gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. we dont have time for wining and dining.
whatever you say...honey.
thanks, jack...
no, im serious...youre really stunning...
this is good stuff, jack, keep it coming...
i mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, theres no question about that.  but this...  ...youve really grown into a beautiful woman...
how can you do that?
do what?
look at me like you havent seen me every day for the last twelve years...
were almost done here...
mary janes, mom.  you promised.
thats right.  okay, lets make a quick stop at the kids shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then ill run into the linen store...
i mean...wow...off the charts great.
its an unbelievable thing.  wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  im gonna buy it...
$2,400?!  are you out of your mind?
she got those shoes...
those shoes were twenty five dollars.  cmon, take it off.  well go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like.
no?
do you have any idea what my life is like?
excuse me?
i wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...i drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, kate.
i pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...i play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if im lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that i always have to drive everyone everywhere?  i spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...im sick of it.
really.
whats in it for me? where are my mary janes?
its sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, jack.
i cant believe its not a disappointment to you!  jesus, kate, i couldve been a thousand times the man i became.  how could you do this to me?  how could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
look, im sorry.  im sorry i was such a saint before and im such a prick now.  maybe im just not the same guy i was when we got married...
maybe youre not.  the jack campbell i married wouldnt need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if thats what its gonna take, then buy it. just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids college fund.
well...annie for one.
surprise.  were pregnant...  yeah...that mustve been...i mean that was very unexpected.  but what are you gonna do, right?
i think it worked out okay, dont you?
sure.  i really like annie.
good, jack.  maybe well keep her.
no, i love annie.  we had a lot of good times, didnt we?
we were young...  remember that little place on charles street we used to go to?
charles street?  in the village?  when we were living in greenwich village...?  great times.  whyd we ever leave?
you cant really raise a kid in an apartment in the village...
the trek out to the hospital every day didnt help either...  you were great. surviving the heart attack was one thing...
you had a heart attack?
jack, stop that. i'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what wouldve happened if you hadnt stepped in at the store.
thats why i work for big ed?
our life in a nutshell...
if you want to look at it that way...
how would you look at it?
damn...
jesus, jack, this is a league match, for gods sake!
wheres your follow through?  wheres your stance?
hey, im doing the best i can...  id like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
youre right.  why am i so competitive!? compensation, i guess. look, just focus, jack. you can still pick up the spare...
evelyn, right?
very funny.  i saw you out there on lane five. what do you have the flu or something?
something like that.
need a nurse?
youre a nurse?
are we...?
are we what, jack?
is there something going on between us?
are we finally being honest?
it would help me if we were.
okay, youre right, weve been dancing around this for years...
hey jack, youre all flush.  i guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
i just saw evelyn thompson.
she is relentless.
she wants to have an affair with me.
she said that?
pretty much.
oh yeah...  what is it about you?
so could you write down her exact address?
whoa...whoa...wait a second, jack.  youre not actually gonna cheat on kate?
it wouldnt really be cheating...  its complicated.
look, maybe im not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  a little flirtations harmless but youre playing with fire here.  the fidelity bank and trust is a tough creditor.  you make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
im telling you, those rules dont apply to me, arn.
screw the rules.  im talking about the choice.
cmon, evelyn thompsons got no class.  she doesnt marry dr. steve, the womans living in a trailer.
hey, is that really necessary?
all im saying it there isnt a guy in union county who wouldnt give his left nut to be married to kate...
how was the game, honey?
long, boring, and generally pretty sad. arnie seemed to enjoy it...  hey, wheres that chocolate cake...?
you mean this chocolate cake?
thats my piece.  i was saving it because i got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
cmon.
sorry, jack.  its too important to me.
you want the cake!?
i want it...
thank you...
its good, right?
say it, jack...
what...?
cmon, you know what i like to hear...
yeah, baby, i know what you like to hear...
then say it...just say it to me...!
oh yeah, youre a bad girl, baby... you make me so hot...im gonna take you to that special place...
not it...?
nice, jack.  youre sweeping me off my feet.
what? you make me hot...
so jack, its your wifes birthday, got anything to say to her?
its your birthday? today?  whats your name?  where were you born?
jack.
wait a minute.  youre my wife?
maybe i should wait...
no, open it...
i found it at an outlet store.  i know its a knock-off, but i think itll look great on you...
zeena...
you really are incredible...
enjoy it, sweetheart...
heres the thing.  i really hadnt planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  you know, anniversarys good all day...
what are you talking about?  you never wait all day.  you can barely wait until its light out.
i know that, but...
you actually forgot our anniversary.
ill fix it.  ill go out right now and get you something.  ill make it right.
not bad...i shoulda warned you.  dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
like what?
one year he had a solar system named after her...
dont you think thats a little gimmicky?
mom liked it.
maybe theres a jewelry store back at the mall. i could get her a pair of earrings or something.
thats good but...you did forget the anniversary.
right.  thats a major oversight...  so if im kate...i cant really afford the finer things, my husbands career is a crushing disappointment to me, im trapped in suburbia...
fightings a part of it, annie.  you know that, right?
im not worried, mom. hes still learning our ways...
jack...can we afford all this?
whats the difference? im taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
how do you even know about this place?
you are so not off the hook yet, slick.
but im gettin close, right?
i need to tell you something.
okay...
i think it may help us but theres a slight chance it could make things worse.
now im worried...just say it.  whatever it is well deal with it.
are you sure?
i used to be so sure about everything, you know?  i knew exactly who i was and what i wanted. then one morning i woke up and suddenly it was all different...
worse, you mean...
no.  well, maybe a few things.  but mostly just different...
i never used to be like this, kate.  i had it all figured out.  no doubts, no regrets.
and now...?
now...i dont...
i think its good to be a little unsure about who you are.  its very human.
but you always seem so certain.
cmon, jack, you think there arent mornings when i wake up and wonder what the hell im doing in new jersey...
thats a big one for me, too.
my office is a dump, i answer my own phone...and youve seen my pay check.
your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
i mean yes, i help people that need it...
i guess...some of them are probably faking.
god, sometimes i think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a cd player...
imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
its wonderful...
good things...
what are you sure about?
you know champagne makes me do crazy things.
ill just full yours up to the top.  happy anniversary, sweetheart.
i dont know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off.
im out of the doghouse?
way out...
youre so...beautiful...
i already told you you were gonna get lucky, jack...
my god, all this time...i never stopped loving you...
thats all i wanted to hear...
i could stay here forever...
i dont think id fight you on that one...
for the money, theyre hands down the best radial we carry...
okay, ill take them...
you wont regret it...  tommy!  set mr. conlin up with four b.f. goodrich g-force t/as...  ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume...
kates on two, jack.  nice ride...
if youre into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
you want me to handle him?  i think im ready...
why dont you let me take this one, kenny?
okay, chief.
peter lassiter...
do i know you?
not exactly. ive seen you on cnbc.  you look taller in real life...
...were really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
but youre not interested in boutique dollars...  i get it...
mr. mintz.
please, call me alan. we try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
i can see that, alan.
you have kids, jack?
uh...actually, yes. two... good ones.
i was a sales associate, at e.f. hutton.
a broker? really. and now youre in the tire business?
thats right. and auto supply...
uh huh. the retail end, i understand.
uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
mind if i ask what kind of sales you did last year? ballpark...
we did one point seven million in total revenue...
uh huh...one point seven. and what do you project for this year?
well, alan, i think were gonna have a banner year. sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
really. so youre projecting what, a tad over two million?
look, i know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  and i know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
im not trying to knock the tire business, jack.
its okay, alan. i get it. im in your shoes, im thinking exactly the same thing...but heres the thing. business is business.  wall street, main street, its all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell theyre gonna send their kids to college.  its just people...
and i know people.
im sure you do...
take you, for instance...
what about me?
you drink about sixteen diet cokes a day. youre an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. you drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch...
he certainly has your number, alan.
youre a little tougher, peter.
for one thing, you like expensive things.
thats easy. youve seen my car.
okay...you smoke hoyo de monterreys. youre a scotch man, single malt, not because its trendy but because youve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. you have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. you wept openly the day the dow hit ten thousand...
...thats our war room. we did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
seven.  really.
good for you. why shouldnt you protect whats yours.
i dont think youre hearing me.
oh, im hearing you, alan. thats not the problem. the problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine.  and i dont care how low on the totem pole i start, i will get it back...  so do yourself a favor and dont get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your french country antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office.
pretty incredible, isnt it?
its like a museum.
so whats the big surprise? you didnt rent this place for the weekend, did you?
think bigger.
for the week?
this place is a perk, kate.
a perk for what?
a company called p.k. lassiter and associates investment house uses it to attract new executives...
youre talking to their new vice president of mergers and acquisitions.
what are you talking about, jack?
are you out of your mind?
i dont think so. this is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  well put annie and josh in private schools...
annie goes to a great school.
im talking about the best schools in the country here, kate...
jack, what could you possibly be thinking? what about my job?
this is new york city, its like the needy people capital of the world.  those jersey clients of yours arent a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
i cant believe you want to move back into the city.  i thought the reason we left was because we didnt want to raise the kids here?
no, this is the center of the universe.  if i were living in roman times, i would live in rome, where else?  today, america is the roman empire and new york is rome itself. john lennon.
jack.
i can do that.  i want to do that.  for all of us. i need to do that as a man...  think about it.  no more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
then get a goddamn snow blower!
dont do that...
look, youre making this into something its not. this isnt a referendum on our lives, kate. its a step forward...  dont you see?  im talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
very nice. what is it?
mary had a little lamb.
ah. a classic...
what are you doing?
