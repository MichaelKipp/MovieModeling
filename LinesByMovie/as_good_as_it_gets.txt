mr. udall... excuse me. hey there!  have you seen verdell?
what is he look like?
my dog... you know... i mean my little dog with the adorable face... do not you know what my dog looks like?
i got it. you are talking about your dog. i thought that was the name of the colored man I have been seeing in the hall.
which color was that?
like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
frank sachs -- melvin udall.
how're you doing?
franks shows my work, mr. udall. i think you know that.
simon, you have got to get dressed.
what i know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, i do not give a fuck what or where you shove your show. are we being neighbors for now?
definitely a package you do not want to open or touch.
hope you find him. i love that dog.
mr. udall, I would like to talk to you please.
'love was... '
yeeeess!!!
maybe this can wait.
i found verdell, mr. udall.
well, that is a load off.
did you... do something to him?
do you realize that i work at him?
no, i didn't.
do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
no...  actually, i even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
well, i work all the time. so never, never again interrupt me. okay? i mean, never. not 30 years from now... not if there is fire. not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there is a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you are going to faint even then do not come knocking or, if it is election night and you are excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer president of the united states... and he is going to put you up in camp david and you just want to share the moment with someone...  do not knock ...  not on this door. not for anything. got me. sweetheart?
yes. it is not a subtle point you are making.
okay, then.
he is genuinely upsetting, is not he?
will not worry about it. you go ahead.
no touch. no touch. no touch.
you may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but i grew up in hell. my grandmother had more attitude. you do not intimidate me.
police! police! fucking crooked police...  doughnut-munching morons help me!  assault and battery and you are black.
shhhh now. i like simon. i like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. meanwhile, I will try and think how you can make this up to him.  i hate doing this. I am an art dealer.  have a nice day. party!
I am starving.
will you please take it?
i know. he is just the best.
I have got jews at my table.
it is not your table. it is the place's table. behave. this once, you can sit at someone else's station.
the table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
you are going to die soon with that diet, you know that?
we are all going to die soon. i will. you will. it sure sounds like your son will.
I am sorry.
do not be silly. how bad?
not bad.
exactly what is your previous experience?
how about that pose?  this is not fun...  give me some direction.
nothing. i just watch till something strikes me. do anything you think of -- try different thing. until i say, "hold that pose." then just try and comfortably hold it.
the fact that you have not said, "hold it" means i have not done it right...  is that correct? i have not done it right?
no...  okay. what i do is watch and wait for, um... you ever watch someone who does not know you are watching...  an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it is in respond to a private thought they just had? they are just sort of realer and more alive. and when you notice it so are you. if you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.
clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she does not hear me. listening to the story from the upset friend...  now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who does not even say, "thank you." no, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it is getting tougher to make believe.
okay.
what is with the plastic picnic ware? why not try ours...  afraid it is not clean?
i see the help -- judgement call.
just give yourself a little pep talk. "must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
what is wrong with your son, anyway?
what do you care?
he is got to fight to breathe. his asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he is allergic to dust and this is new york and his immune system bails on him when there is trouble so an ear infection...  is this bothering you?
no.
an ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where i get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. nice chatting with you.
his name?
spencer.
okay.
spence.
so you are practically finished, huh?
yes...  well, there is one more stage -- trying to figure out if it is any good.
wait -- i want to see the painting.
just a second -- he has to go.
please!! no!!!
why are you doing this?
no. no. no. hey, that painting in there...  i just want to tell you...
okay. so you call 911 and do not leave your name -- even a dumb geezer should know that emergency automatically pulls up your name. how come you make a mistake like that?
how come you are pretending to do cop work -- 'cause i do not think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
what?
just move on. no one here killed him.
oh, is he dead?
ask him.
we will if we can and if we can't, we will come back and ask you again and again.
you are taking him...  yes...  you are taking him -- this will clear the books. one night. you want to say "no" to me? try...  because I have never felt as nuts as i do right this second. i almost want you to try saying "no."
I am not saying nothing to you.
thanks for looking after him.
hey, where are you going? you can not do this.  i can not take a dog.  nobody's ever been in here before.
you do not want to mess with me today. I will figure something else out tomorrow.
how you doing, great one?
i have not looked at myself yet. i figured i could tell from your reaction.
hey, hey...  haaa...  bad but temporary. the nurses say it is much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they are sure...
jackie, will you hand me the mirror?
so, what is new anyway? how is verdell?
your neighbor -- udall -- is taking care of him.
how could you do that? he will hurt him.
no, i promise...  not a chance. i own this guy. there was no one else. I am on the move too much. trust me.
you are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
yes. your dog is fine, simon.
so what are you doing with a dog?
suckered in. set up. pushed around.
you are not worried that someone might take him?
well, not until now -- for christ's sake.
sorry.
it is okay -- I will sit here.
you know he is a little dog. next time, if bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
how old are you?
oh, please...
if i had to guess by your eyes, I would say you were fifty.
and if i had to guess by your eyes. I would say you were kind. so, so much for eyes. but as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
otherwise, you are not ugly.
okay, pal...  i accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
what is with the dark?
last week i was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so i decide I am going to make a little joke...
you all set here?
how is verdell doing?
he is a pain in the ass.
simon's home. i was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he is had a chance to think and adjust...
it is been five weeks...  another few will not kill me.
no. he wants him back. he will be by tomorrow.
okay by me.
that is some face they left hanging on you. you look like...
could you take it just a little easy, mr. udall?
thank you. verdell...  sweetheart?  by the way, thanks for saving me.
i called. i never touched you. i did not leave my name or nothing.
verdell?
no. please, do not force him.
you little stinker. he is given you everything.
help!
if you want to see me you will not do this. you will make an appointment...
explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like i have any choice in barging in.
there is not going to be a debate. you must leave.
you said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
i can help you if you take the responsibility to keep regular app --
you changed the room around...
two years ago...
i also regrew my beard...  but you are not interested in changes in me... so it is like i always told you...  when it comes to people you...
shhhhhhh. i do not have this mountain of available time...  i got to get to my restaurant on time. do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
yes.  no.
what the heck are those for?
no. no. get carol.
I am filling in. we do not know if she is coming back. she might have to get a job closer to home.
what are you trying to do to me?
what the heck do you mean?
hey, elephant girl, call her or something...  just let her do my one meal here. I will pay whatever. I will wait.  do it!!!
I am hungry.  you have upset my whole day. i have not eaten.
what are you doing here?
this is not a sexist thing. if you were a waiter i would still be here saying...
are you totally gone? this is my private home...
i am trying to keep emotions out of this. even though this is an important issue to me and i have strong feelings about the subject.
what subject? that i was not there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
yes, i do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it i have not gotten personal and you have. why are not you at work? you are not sick -- you do not look sick... just very tired and bitter.
my son is sick, okay?
what about your mother?
how do you know about my mother?
i hear you talk when I am waiting!!!
sorry, honey...  I will be right there.
how ya doing?
yeah, yeah...  any chance you will get back to work today?
no!!! stay away from me!
sorry. what are those cards?
frank's idea. he thought i should have notes so i did this right... maintained focus, did not get emotional and tried not to terrify you.
terrify me?
see, he is right. i need the cards.  simon, you are broke.
the medical bill are 61 thousand now. I have spoken to your parents and they did not hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
well, i can not reach them.
frank loves you. you know that... but I have spoken to him and he feels that --  -- as a businessman, with limited resources...
I will be able to keep my apartment and studio, will not i?...  just tell me.
i can not resist. you usually move through here so quickly and i have so many questions i want to ask you. you have no idea what your work means to me.
what is it mean?
that somebody out there knows what it is like to be...  in here.
oh god, this is like a nightmare.
aw come on, just a couple of questions -- how hard is that?
how do you write women so well?
i think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
what? please? now? tell me?!
mrs. connelly. I am martin bettes ...  dr. bettes.
not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! where is he?
he is in the bathroom...  he is fine.
tell me how bad it is. i let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and i know better...  and i let him talk me into it. he was whining and...  you do not need this. give me a second to catch hold.
hi...  did you know there are doctors who come to your house?
no, i didn't.  so why are you h...
i did not know you had a secret admire.
huh?
you met the gift.
he is good...  and I am an expert on doctors.
stay out of this...  doctor?
my wife is melvin udall's publisher.  she says i have to take great care of this guy because you are urgently needed back at work. what work do you do?
I am a waitress.
how long has he been having problems?
since forever.
have they done blood tests on him?
yes.
only in the emergency room or when he was well.
emergency room only.
have they done skin testing for allergies?
no.
they have not done the standard scratch test. where they make small injections into the skin?
no. i asked. they said it is not covered under my plan. and it is not necessary anyway.
it is amazing these things were not done.
fucking h.m.o. bastard piece of shit...  I am sorry...  forgive me.
no. actually, i think that is their technical name.
once the tests come back, is there someone i can reach in your office for the results?
me. my home number is on this card.
his home number.
do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
water...  nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in spencer's room?
no.
doc!!!  so listen, you got to let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
they are considerable. but mr. udall wants to be billed.
is he dead yet?
no! would there be any way for you to be willing to walk his dog for him?
absolutely.
not just today -- uh, could you do it -- until, until he gets back on his feet?
sure thing.
you are a wonderful man. two of the clock is a good time. here's the key in case he is asleep. open the curtains for him, so he sees god's beautiful work and knows that even things like this happen for the best.
where did they teach you to talk like this -- some panama city "sailor want to hump-hump bar"? or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. sell crazy some place else -- we are all stocked up here.
there is a seriously goofy man behind this. you are not allowed to block out that fact.
do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in emergency who keep telling us they can not help?
it lets a crazy man into our lives.
come on. why fight when we know how it will come out. this is not like stocking or a string of pearls. you do not send this one back.
maybe I will bring him some food by.
thank you for walking him.
if you will excuse me I am not feeling so well.
it smells like shit in here?
go away.
that cleaning woman doesn't...
please, just leave.
where are all your queer party friends?
get out.
nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
nellie, you are a disgrace to depression.
rot in hell, melvin.
no need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you will be back on your knees in no time.
well, I will do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
get out.
do not piss on a gift, tough guy. you want to know why the dog prefers me...  it is not affection. it is a trick.
i carry bacon in my pocket.
oh, my gosh.
now we will both call him.
come on, sweetheart...
yo, yo, yo...
would you leave now, please?
stupid dog.  i do not get it.
uh, udall?
carol the waitress?
yes.
the doctors had your billing address. I am sorry about the hour.
i was working...  can not you just drop me a thank-you note?
that is not why I am here...  ...  though you have no idea what it is like to have a real conversation with a doctor about spencer...
note. put it in the note.
why did yo do this for me?
to get you back at work so you can wait on me.
but you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? I am worried that you did this because...
you waiting for me to say something?  what sort of thing do you want? look, I will be at the restaurant tomorrow.
i do not think i can wait until tomorrow. this needs clearing up.
what needs clearing up?
I am not going to sleep with you. i will never, ever sleep with you. never. not ever.
I am not kidding.
okay!!!! anything else?!?
just how grateful i am.
so you will be at work?
yes.
i brought you chinese soup.
thanks.
i have never been so tired in my life. okay, if i sit here?
got any easier questions?
i have not been sleeping. i have not been clear or felt like myself. I am in trouble. some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back...  but the tiredness -- boy...  not just sleepy.
but sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
yeah...
you are not still writing that thank-you note?
I am on the last page. how do you spell conscience?
c-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. i got sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
i still do not feel safe leaving spencer with someone. how do you spell it again?
spencer is okay. you would better start finding something else to do with your free time. if you can not feel good about this break and step out a little...  you ought to get mr. udall to send you over a psychiatrist.
i do not need one 'cause i know what is really going on here. i have to finish this letter or I will go nuts.  this can not be right -- con- science.
i do not know... it is very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and i felt myself giving them a dirty look -- i had no idea everything was...
go ahead.
... moving in the wrong direction... away from when i even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for christ's sake. i was feeling like really bad that dr. bettes is married.  which is probably why i make poor spencer hug me more than he wants to... like the poor kid does not have enough problems. he has to make up for his mom not getting any.  oh, boy. who needs these thoughts?
spencer's doing fine. so what are you saying, that you are frustr...
leave me be! why are you doing this? why are you picking at my sores... what is it that you want?... you want what? what is with you? i hope getting me thinking of everything that is wrong when all i want is to not do this has some purpose.  what is it, mom? no kidding.
what is it you want? what?
i want us to go out.
do you love me?
uh-huh.
it is not my dog and this simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.
sure -- take him to the vet.
i did. and his stomach is out of whack. so they need him for a couple of days.
do it.
what is this?
a thank-you note for what you did for me.
she is nice.
really nice. should not that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
it looks like it really went over. you are sure making the rounds. simon says you brought him soup last night. i hope he does not write you a note.
what?
"what?" look at you... you sense a mark.
hey -- you called me... i...
about a dog.
yeah, but it is all about simon now... you helped with the dog... and now there are other things. I am just as concerned as you are about simon.
concerned. I am just the hall monitor here.
it is not only financial assistance. what he is got to do is go to baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. it is not going to happen on the phone.
yeah. if his parents are alive they have got to help -- those are the rules. good.
yes. and tomorrow? i have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... so I am out. can you take him?
think white and get serious.
take my car -- a convertible. do you drive?
like the wind but I am not doing it.
getting loud, getting loud.
he wants me to take his car and his client to baltimore.
i want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so i can get out of this city.
okay... so I will see you tomorrow. let's not drag this out. we do not enjoy another that much.
if there is some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
last word freak.
so. anything else?
yes. I am going to give my queer neighbor a lift to baltimore.
okay.
hey, what i did for you is working out?
what you did changed my life.
no... no thank you notes.
well, part of what i said in this entire history of my life which you will not read is that somehow you have done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... and that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I have ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
lovely.
i also wrote one part... i wrote I am sorry... i was talking about i was sorry when i got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so i wrote that.  i was sorry for busting you on that... and I am sorry for busting in on you that night... when i said i was never... i was sorry and I am sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
nice of you... thank you.
thank you.
now i want you to do something for me.
oh, I am sorry... did not i say, "what?" i thought i said, "what?"... what?
i want you to go on this trip.
no, sir...
i can not do this alone. I am afraid he will pull the stiff one eye on me. i need you to chaperon. separate everything but cars. you said you liked convertibles. now I am on the hook.
the stiff one eye?
two days.
i can't. i work.
you take off when you have to.
my son.
bettes tells me he is doing fine.
melvin, I would rather not.
what is that got to do with it?
funny, i thought it was a strong point.
write me a note and am not she sweet. i need a hand and where did she go.
are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
is there another way to see it?
no.
hello?
are you still coming?
yes.
melvin... I would like to know exactly where we are going.
just south to baltimore, maryland. so i know what you are going to ask next.  that you might ask -- I am not certain.
there's... there is no need to bring anything dressy... or... i mean -- i did not know if we would be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
oh.  we might. yes. we can. let's.
okay, gotcha. what did you think i was going to ask?
whether crabs are in season there now...
oh. okay, then -- melvin. good night.
how was it talking to him?
stop treating this like I am going away with a man. he is just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. i hate this, mom -- i hate this. he is a freak show -- the worst person i ever met.
well, maybe he has nice friends.
call me as soon as you are settled.
i love you.
I am sorry that I am not taking you.
so am i, frank.
hi.
thanks for being on time... carol, the waitress, this is simon, the fag.
hello... oh, my god, who did that to you?
i, uh... i was... attacked. walked in on people robbing me. i was hospitalized. i almost died.
let's do the small talk in the car. load up.
i was going to do that for you.
it is okay. no problem. where should we sit?
i -- uh, i... well, there is no place cards or anything.
let me go in back. you look like you need all the room you can manage.
that is very thoughtful.
never a break. never.
thanks, melvin.
welcome.
i do not know the last time I have been out of the city... hey, my arms are tanning. i used to tan great. we got to stop soon so'se i can check on spencer.
I am sorry... i can not hear you. i can not turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can not hear her.
I am sure, simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... but when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
nonsense!
anybody here who is interested in what melvin has to say raise their hands.
do you want to know what happened with my parents?
yes. i really would.
well...
no, let me pull over so i can pay full attention.
well, i always painted. always. and my mother always encouraged it. she was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... i was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. she used to pose nude for me... and i thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
this stuff is pointless.
hey -- you let him...
you like sad stories -- you want mine.
... my father did not leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if i made a mistake on the piano.
go ahead, simon. your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.
that is not true. some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. just not anybody in this car. but lots of people -- that is their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that is what makes it hard. not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
no.
not it at all, really.
not at all, huh?!... let's go to the hotel. and if you are lucky tomorrow dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
no answer... maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. can i have that one?
yes... sure.  I will take the sofa.
do you ever get an erection for a woman?
melvin...
would not your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
you consider your life easy.
i give you that one...  nice packing.
my son was outside playing soccer. i never saw him playing ball. come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... take me out dancing.
dancing?
i do not blame you... this is a monumental first day out... you sad or anything?
no... nervous. it would be very rough, carol, if you were not along.
what a nice compliment.
good evening.
hi. you have hard shells, right?
stop asking everyone.
just him and that is it. okay, you can answer -- we have worked it out.
yes, we do... and i can give you a tie and jacket.
what?
they require a tie and jacket but we have some available.
no... I am not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I am not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
you promised a nice place -- can not you just...  you have these dry cleaned all the time, do not you?
actually, i do not think so.
wait here.
shall i get her for you?
no, it is all right. I will just watch.
you wanna dance?
I have been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
and?
no...  ... i do not get this place. they make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. i do not get it.
no. wait. what? why? i did not mean it. you got to sit down. you can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
melvin, pay me a compliment... i need one and quick... you have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
that monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. never fails.
that is not compliment, melvin... that is just trying to sound smart so i feel stupid... a compliment is something nice about somebody else... now or never.
okay.
and mean it...
can we order first?
two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer.  baked or fries?
fries.
one baked -- one fries.
i am so afraid you are about to say something awful...
do not be pessimistic. it is not your style. okay... here i goes... clearly a mistake.  i have this -- what? ailment... and my doctor -- a shrink... who i used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. i hate pills. very dangerous things, pills. "hate," i am using the word "hate" about pills. my compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you would never -- well, you were there, you know... the next morning i started taking these pills.
i do not quite get how that is a compliment for me.
that is maybe the best compliment of my life.
then I have really overshot here 'cause i was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
so how are you doing with those pills? well, i hopahopahopa.
takes months to know... they work little by little.  talking like this is exhausting.
have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
never.
here's the trouble with never.
you do not owe me that.
that was not payment. when you first came into breakfast, when i saw you -- i thought you were handsome... then, of course, you spoke... so now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. tell me, why did you bring me?
well, ah... that is a personal question.
tell me even if you are scared. tell me why you wanted me here. it is okay.
if you ask me... I will say, "yes."
there are lots of reason... i had a thought that if you had sex with simon it might...
sex with simon?
it is one idea...
that is why you brought me? look at me! is that really why you brought me... like I am a what and i owe you what?!
i do not know why i brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... it came out first... hey, you kiss him -- me... he says he loves you. you two hit it off. but you do not want to... fine... forget what i said about sex with simon. it was a mistake.
I will never forget you said it.
it was a mistake.
was this supposed to be your room?
our room. i do not want to see him and he is not going to come knocking on your door.
can you not be violent?
i do not think so. you need help with the pants?
no!!!
I am going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
uh-huh...
I am sorry... are you okay?
well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow i have to face my parents... do not ask me ... I am sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
why? what have you been thinking about?
how to die, mostly.
can you believe in our little mix you are the good roommate.
good night.
good night.
I have got to sketch you.
no... absolutely not. I am shyer than you think. i give the wrong impression sometimes and...
i have not even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
stop staring. do a vase.
but you are beautiful... your skin glows.
thanks. but i just want to take a bath and...
that long neck -- the line of you... you are porcelain... your back goes on forever. you are classic... you are why cavemen chiseled on walls...
all right, cut me a break.
sorry, did not realize she was right there.  did you have sex with her?
to hell with sex.
we held each other. it was better than sex. what i need he gave me great.
i just love her.  how're you doing?
i get why you are angry. it is no snap to explain why i was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
... so mom. truly no grudges -- truly. a little odd that you did not come to see me when you heard i was hurt, but the important thing i want you to know is your son is happy. I am working again. I will make do -- i do not want a thing. would not take it if it was offered. I will drop you a note from wherever i land and then it is up to you. i hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, i wish you both the very best... i can not hear you. you heard me, though, right? good -- take good care. 'bye.
... now he is going to want to stay. and they will want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. so it is a good five hours back. it gives us a chance to take it easy and...
I am going back with you.
but what about...
I will take care of myself --
what are you talking about? you got real problems.
i know. I am a little bit nervous. suddenly everything seems so easy. carol, a load has been lifted.
one night with me!
you think you are kidding.
nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
let me see... ahh, gorgeous!
do it then. get the dog picked up. i can not believe you let it stay there.
good-bye.  well, your luck is holding. they sublet your place. you are homeless. frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
another place where?
does it matter?
i do not want to hear that music right now.
what do you mean? you said you liked it.
i don't.
this one has a special meaning.
it is your car but i do not want to hear it. if that means anything.
here are the keys to my apartment. I am going to park you in my place while i take carol home.
I will take a bus.
I will take you... why not?
i do not care what you did for me. i do not think i want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  you have my number.
i love you...  let him take you home.
do not want to. i love you.
i told you to go on in.
look, I have got to get a hold of frank and see where I am hanging my hat 'cause...
i think you gotta camp it here...
what are you talking about?
thank you, melvin. you overwhelm me.
they did a nice job... cozy, huh?
i love you.
sorry, did not know you were awake. i just thought verdell should not get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then...
look, we both want the dog -- and...
hello.
yeah... well...
how you doing?
i can trust my brain.
that seems like a good choice.
i do not know whether I am being sensible or hard on you.
the two might go together.
see. there is an example. i do not know whether you are being cute or crazy now.
cute.
you do not have to answer everything i say. just listen to me. okay?
okay to say something now?
go ahead.
i should have danced with you.
okay. good-bye.
so long.
you going to come talk to me or not?
I am coming.
what did she say?
I am a great guy -- "extraordinary"...  ... and she does not want contact with me.  I am dying here.
because...  ... you love her?
no... and you are supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
okay... you tell me why --  "you're dying here."
i do not know... let me sleep on it and figure it out.  because I am stuck! can not go back to what i had... she is evicted me from my life.
did you like it that much?
it was better than this... look, you, I am very intelligent. if you are going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you are doing. if you can not be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I am drowning and you are describing water.
picking on me will not help.
well, if that is true then I am really in trouble.
but you know where you are lucky?
absolutely not.
you know who you want. I will take your seat any day. so do something... do not sleep on it... go over there. i do not think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it is not always good to let things calm down.
hey... I am charged here. but she might kill me for showing up this late.
then get in your jammies and I will read you a story... i think you have got a chance. the only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
okay. thanks a lot. here i go.
what is wrong?
i forgot to lock the door.
what do you want, melvin?
were you asleep?
what do you want?
'cause if you were asleep -- I am sorry. and you could be grouchy.
grouchy?
... 'cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. so then i would not even try.
what job?
were you asleep?
what are you doing here?
i was not asleep!!
what a break...
is it a secret what you are doing here?
i had to see you...
because...
it relaxes me... I would feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else i can think of or imagine.
stop it!! why can not i have a normal boyfriend??? why? get out of here. just a regular boyfriend who does not go nuts on me...
everybody wants that, dear -- it does not exit...  sorry... did not mean to interrupt.
boyfriend?
oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
maybe we could live without the wise cracks.
it feels a little confined here. let's take a walk.
see. it is four in the morning. a walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you do not mind.
if you need an excuse, there is a bakery on the corner. there is a shot it will open soon -- that way we are not screwy -- we are just two people who like warm rolls.
okay.
I am feeling... I have been feeling better.
melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you do not know me all that well...  I am not the answer for you.
hey, I have got a great compliment for you.
you know what? i...
just let me talk.  I am the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you are the greatest woman on earth. I am the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with spencer -- spence...  ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that is all about being straight and good...
no! it is certainly not. no -- i do not think so. no.
I am going to grab you.  i did not mean it to be a question. I am going to grab you.
