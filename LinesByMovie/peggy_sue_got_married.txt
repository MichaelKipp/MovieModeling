and we are here on the couch...
do not say that...
we are here on the sofa bed...
charlie...
...to record how much we love each other. sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. and she would like to say something.
come on peggy. say what we rehearsed.
i can't. I am too embarrassed.
but you love me do not you?
yeah. come on charlie, turn it off.
and nothing will ever change that.
there is something pathetic parked in front of my house.
come off it, peggy. and what do you mean your house? this is my house. i paid for it, I am still paying for it.
I am still waiting for the mortgage check.
i mailed it to you on wednesday.
well, today's saturday and it is still not here.
jesus, peggy. take it easy. I am not used to that stuff. you always did the bills. blame the damn post office.
you got a tab?
i do not buy them anymore. you were the only one who drank them.
you do not want them? they are going to make a big comeback any minute. mark my words, these lamps are going to...
i know. put scott through college.
I will think of a way to sell, them.  one day.
are you taking janet to the reunion tonight?
I am not going.
carol!
peggy sue!
1 just did it for the reunion. i thought it would be fun.
you are probably the only one who could carry it off.
where were you? you said you would be back at twelve.
this is my old friend carol.. i told you about her.
r was worried about you  you did not even call. you are always on my case if i do not call..
how do you like my hair?
it looks great. do not change the subject. you know how busy saturdays are. and i can not do the icing. i always mess up the roses. you are not being very responsible.
but i want you and scott to understand.  do you think he loves janet? maybe he is smashed too many fortune cookies.
come on mom. give him a break. he is missing the reunion because of you. you know he wants to go.
then we would both have a miserable time. what do you think?
hey, you are a hip chick. you look like you stepped right out of life magazine. any time you want to borrow it again, just ask.
borrow?! this was my dress.  maybe it is a mistake. what if I am the only one? i do not even want to go. everybody's just going to say...  hi.. where is crazy charlie?
mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
i feel ridiculous. maybe i should go home and change.
why are you so nervous? what is the matter with you today?
i do not know. reunions do funny things to people.
it was beth's idea.
i wish i had the nerve. and the figure.
beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
it must run in the family.
are you peggy sue kelcher?
i was once. richard!? richard norvik? i did not recognize you.
you look exactly the same.
i just did it for tonight. i do not normally dress like this.
hello. nice to meet you. please call me peggy. I am peggy bodell now.
where is charlie? i was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. really made me laugh.
he is not here. we are getting divorced.
gee. I am sorry to hear that.
welcome to the singles scene.
i do not know how you do it. I have never even dated anybody but charlie.
you just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... i thought you had a pretty good marriage.
we did for a long time. we just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
so he started having affairs, and you got depressed.
you should have left here years ago, like i did.
it is not the place. i do not buy that.  trapped in the same town forever. the price she would pay for her teenage lust.
after you got knocked up, my mother did not want me to talk to you. she thought it was contagious.
oh, it is not so bad. i have two wonderful kids, my own business.  still, knowing what i know now, if i had the chance to do it all over again, I would sure do things a lot differently.
would not we all.
i remember that dress.
rosalie testa!
i remember when you got that locket, too. you were so excited i think you showed it to the whole school.
you have an incredible memory.
hi, peggy. god, that walter getz	can still dance.
your first boyfriend. what do you think? any sparks left?
who knows. remember...  whatever walter wants...
lucky lady. hi.
michael fitzsimmons! is he here?
the only one?
well, besides charlie, of course.
the only time people like dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. that guy, doug snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a foureyed worm.
well, you showed them. you are rich and famous and successful. and you have a beautiful wife.
you were always friendly to me. i appreciated that.  you know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
what was?
dancing with you.
you are a sweet man, richard.
i guess part of us never really leaves high school.
you know, i never told anybody this, but i always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
they are waiting. come on.
i can't. it is all too much.
go on. you can do it.
i vant to suck your blood. i also vant to suck your twinkie.
charlie! am i dead?
no. you are the undead. you will live forever if you give me your twinkie.  come on, let's have it. you hate them anyway.
where is it?
were taking you back to the nurse.
maddy, what did you do to your hair?
we are going to take you home.
that is okay. I am sure I will remember the way.
I will call you later.
yes. let's stay in touch.
mom!
the nurse called and said you would be coming home.
i have a note.
how do you feel?
I am excused.
why do not you go lie down for a while.
mom!
chanel number five. that always reminds me of home.
of course, dear. you are home now.
I am home now.
what are you doing?
I am just happy to see you.
come on! mom said you were sick. you are never happy to see me.
I am sorry about that. i really want us to be closer. i have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
teenagers are weird. and you are the weirdest.
let's do something together.. do you want to play monopoly? or careers... clue... snakes and ladders?
okay, what do you want? what dumb favor do you want me to do?
it is unbelievable. the man never ages.
look at kenny rossi. is not he dreamy? i wish he would break up with arlene. she thinks she is so great.
do not eat the red ones.
why not? they are my favorite.
they are bad for you. they cause...red lips.
young lady, you are drunk!
just a little. I have had a tough day.
i do not see the humor in this. go to your room immediately. you are grounded.
grounded? ha! the story of my life. i do not wanna go to my room. i wanna import japanese cars. i wanna go to liverpool and discover the beatles.
jack, take it easy. she gave blood at school today. maybe she is just a little lightheaded.
this is not giving blood. this is drunk.
dad, i never knew you had a sense of humor.
evelyn, put her to bed.
my little baby. do not try to grow up so fast.
oh mom, i forgot you were ever so young.
a new car. we can not afford a new car.
do not worry, it is just a seasonal slump.
you have four seasons, you have four slumps.
what happened to your hair? you have such a pretty face. why are you always trying to cover it up?
oh. i forgot.
you are looking pretty chipper this morning.
I am still here, are not i? i may as well enjoy myself. I am going to go to school today.  dad, i want to apologize for yesterday. the car is a classic. use it in the best of health.
thank you.. i accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.
that would be impossible.
you are so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
mom, is there any coffee left?
when did you start drinking coffee?
oh.	ah...recently. all the kids drink it.
if all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
i think I am way ahead of them.
and the butter.
you know, you two are wonderful parents. I am really going to try to behave myself.
mom, sit down for a minute. this is so nice, all of us being together again like this.
can i tell diane that peggy sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret?  well?
oh yeah. charlie. how am i going to handle him?
what is the matter? did you two have a fight?.
sort of.
what about?
the house payments.
how do you feel?
pretty strange.
not now, charlie. I have got a headache. get used to the word. roll it around your tongue for a years.
hey, i can take a hint. you look great today.
you drive like a maniac!
i call this the staccato.
not that I am glad you were sick, but i had a chance to do some thinking last night.
oh yeah?
you know. about what we said on tuesday. it makes a lot of sense.
refresh my memory.
how could you forget? we talk about seeing other people and you forget?
maybe i blocked it out.
i can understand that.. but please do not start crying again.
it is not going to be forever. i figure three years is long enough. i can see it the music pans out.  and right after graduation we should start seeing other people. kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. know what i mean?
why wait?
well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. we should not upset our parents?
they will learn to live with it.
want me to drive you home later?
would you?
would i?!! why i oughta...
did you study for the test?
test?
i do not get it.
that is because you' re not a total moron like they are.
congratulations on the math contest, richard.
it really was not that difficult.
i have to talk to you. it is very important.
I am not doing any tutoring this year. I am too busy.
it is not that. can we meet after school? please?
all right. I will be in the physics lab. make it fourthirty. i have a rocket club meeting.
looking good out there.
thanks.
i noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. i guess i deserved it. I have been thinking about my three year plan and i think it is unworkable. i must have been delirious.
i thought it had a lot of merit.
in the abstract maybe. get a grip on yourself! but when i imagine you going out with other guys, i feel... ah...
rejected, worthless, miserable.
yeah. like that.
good.
what a great kite.
I am writing a book on kite construction. what did you want to talk about?
i want to ask you a question.  do you think...time travel is possible?
are you doing some kind of science project?
sort of.
well... in a newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
and then, there is richard's burrito.
what is that?
that is my own theory based on a mexican food called the burrito. i had it once when my parents took me to disneyland.
i	know what a burrito is.
well, i think time is like a burrito. sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
what is inside?
you can till it with whatever you want. from illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
so you think time travel is possible? for people?
absolutely. people, dogs, elephants.
listen, you have got to keep this a secret. you can not tell a soul. promise?
okay. i promise.
this is serious. nobody can know. ah, I have returned from the future. i traveled back here 25 years.
you probably are crazy. wait a minute. is this some kind of joke? i know what you all, think of me.
you have a blind grandfather. one day you are going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. i read about it. you are going to be famous. you are going to invent a lot of things.
how, did you know about my grandfather?
because I am telling you the truth. i know what is going to happen. there is going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. and an american named neil armstrong is going to walk on the moon. on july 20, 1969.
holy toledo! that is six years ahead of schedule!
but when did you leave? are you here until then? were you there until now? what direction are you going in? are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? can anyone do it?
i do not know.
I would be very careful if i were you. you don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
that is why i was getting a divorce..  what i really think is that i had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
you look pretty good for a corpse.
come on, richard, I am serious.
you are giving me the creeps.
am i dead or not?
there is one way to find out.
what are you doing?
confucious says, the way out is through the door. there is a truck. there is your door.
okay, you are not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
what if it is beyond science? what it it is god?
you are a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. maybe you have just got powers of precognition. well, maybe you are just out of whack.
i told you, I have already lived my life. i do not know how or why I am here, but you have to help me get back. i want to get back to my real life!
all right, I will work on it, i'll, do some research. but in the meantime, do not get crazy.
I am trying. I will see you tomorrow.
what if you are not here tomorrow?
who was that man?
it was nobody. ah... he is a poll, taker. I am thinking of voting democrat this year. but do not mention it to your father. how was school today?
it was great to see everybody again. but it is so boring and regimented. most of what they teach is useless. the worst thing was lunch.
would you get that, dear?
sure, mom.  hello.
peggy! what is the matter? who is it?
it is grandma. i can not talk to her now.  I am sorry, grandma.
what happened to you?
i had a dream that grandma died.
well, she is getting on, but she is fine. i told her you were not feeling well yesterday. she called to find out how you are.
she did? i love her so much, and i have not seen her in such a long time. and grandpa barney. is he all, right?
yes, he is fine, too. you saw them at easter.
I am sorry, mom. I will call grandma back and apologize.
that is a good girl... i hate to see you so upset.  tell me, sweetheart. are you having problems with charlie? you mentioned something this morning.
I am confused about a lot of things right now. charlie's only one of them.
is charlie pressuring you to do things you do not think you should be doing?
what do you mean?
peggy, do you know what a penis is?  stay away from it.
hello, charlie.
hello, sir. how are things at the hat store?
fine, thanks. come on in. i want to talk to you.
yes, sir.
she seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. my wife says that is the way girls act sometimes.
yes, sir. but that is what i like about her. she is not like all the other girls at school.
charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we have always regarded you a a fine young man. we have trusted you with our daughter.
yes, sir. trust is a twoway street. in the past two years I have been pleased to note that you and mrs. kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman i plan to take off your hands.
charlie's downstairs. why are not you ready?
for what?
maddy's party.
i do not feel very festive.
you accepted an invitation, maddy's one of your best friends, and i baked the rice krispie squares.
we think this party might cheer her up. just make sure you know what is expected of you.
what would that be, sir?
show her a good time, but for god's sake restrain yourself.
of course.
where did you get that sweater?
great, is not it?
it is really fifties. you sort of clash with the world.
hey! what is the fun of being a teenager if you can not dress weird? and we are going to have fun tonight, right?
right. i promised my mother.
is this slow enough for you?
charlie, how are you?
I am fine peggy sue. and how are you? are we talking on the phone? are we pen pals?
seriously. what is it like to be eighteen?
can you believe i want to marry that dork.
why do guys do such stupid things?
charlie really has a great voice.
maybe they will be the next dion and the belmonts.
do not get your hopes up.
come on, where is your enthusiasm?
he is kind of cute, is not he?
yeah. you are so lucky. he really loves you, too. he is always telling walter how wonderful you are.
he does?
carol and i saw you with that creep, richard, today.
first of all, richard is not a creep. he happens to be an exceptional person. if any of you gave him half a chance, you would find that out.
god, peggy, you are so unformed you are practically fetal. you are just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
dolores, can not you be a little kinder to people? you do not even know the boy. if you were not so neurotic and insecure, maybe you would shut up for a while and show some compassion.
are you for real?
touchy, touchy!
charlie, what do you think of richard norvik?
is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
he is trying.
hey! who needs physics when we have got chemistry?
come on, let's dance.
there is not a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
you are pretty charming when you want to be.
yeah i know.  but i do not have to flatter you.  it just feels right. you are the perfect girl for me.  as in is, was and always will be.  I am glad dancing was invented.  you know the first dances were rituals. like fertility rites.
hey terry, what is that?  did peggy make it up?  I have never seen that on bandstand.
what if we are witnessing the end of touch dancing?
mmm. this is nice.  i always loved the way you kiss.  i missed you.
your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight.  and the tide rushes in.
you really love me, do not you?
you know i do.  i even wrote you into my will.
charlie, let's make love.
what?! you mean sex?! intercourse?  you want to have intercourse! last weekend you said... what time is it?
a lot's happened since last weekend.
but you are the one who wanted to wait till we got married. and you were right. we should wait.
i probably meant it when i said it.  does not lucky chuckie want to come out?
who?
you know. your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
you mean my wang? listen, it is running real late.
this is a mistake. we better forget it.
you are damn right! jesus! peggy! you sure know how to spoil a mood.
I am sorry charlie.
save it.
i was impressed with what you said in english class today.
gilfond's okay, except he thinks hemingway's great literature.
you don't?
he is a fisherman! the most overrated writer of the century. i mean, he is the perfect american author  fat, violent, drunk...
maybe you are confusing his life with his work.
a writer's life is his work. jack kerouac does not have to kill a bull to have something to write about. he is out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
the young man leaned back in his chair. no bulls would die today.
what are you doing here anyway?
coffee and a donut.
i thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
hey, man, I am a hip chick.
terry, slow down.
okay.
terry! slow down.
what, why?
there is peggy with michael fitzsimmons.
that commie beatnik? what is she doing with him? wait'll i tell charlie.
first a nerd and then a weirdo. what a bunch of nose pickers. I will tell charlie.
this is great reefer.
yeah. I am surprised. it is really old...  travels well though.  you know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
the world is fantastic. it is the ultimate absurd circus. i am shot from a cannon into the energy.
what are you shooting for?
maximum intensity. yeah. i can not wait to get out of here. I am going to write. I am going to check out of this bourgeois motel. push myself away from the dinner table and say 'no more jello for me, mom.'
do not you get along with your parents?
the only thing my father digs is cold, green money. all my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
they care about you. they are just a different generation.
hey what is with you? i thought you were cool. you rode my bike. you blew some pot.  what is your scene miss majorette? you going to marry mr. blue impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
i already did that. i want to be a dancer, i want to dance.
a ray of oneness piercing the solitude. falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. you will be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
is that one of your poems?
no, i just made that up. do you want to hear one?
I would love to.
okay. here's a new one. it is called tenderness.  i could not sleep so i thought I would scream betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. in the madhouse of dr. dread razor shreds of rat puke fall on my bare arms  I am sorry. i guess i was trying to impress you.
where have you been?
i went for a drive. up in the hills.
damn that charlie i
it is not charlie. it is me.
peggy, let me ask you something.  you are not... expecting are you?
at my age? do not be silly.
thank god for that.
dad.. it is not a big deal. did not you ever stay out all night when you were young?
yes but i was a boy. and i still had hell to pay.
calm down. just listen for a minute.. please.
all right. but this better be good.
i want to help with the family finances. i want you to buy some stocks. and gold. by 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. then you sell.
do you know how ridiculous you sound? first of all, it is illegal for u.s. citizens to buy gold. and in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
i think they are going to deregulate it.
that is your problems the more women think, the more trouble they get into.
oh boy, that is another thing that is going to change. who is going to think for us? our husbands? you know, you treat mom like a maid. it is not entirely your fault. those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that is the way you raised me. but give nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
I have heard just about enough of this lunacy! go to your room!
listen dad, please. buy ibm, buy polaroid, buy apple computer. no, no. not yet. buy xerox!
evelyn, take her to her room!
I am not the maid!
way to go, mom!
the way i see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
I am just not the type. besides, i want to get out of here.
but you have a vision. do not you want to help your parents?
i tried to tell them, but they would not listen to me.
I am talking about invention, no investment. i know what people think of me. mr. spasmatician. dick the square root. I will show them. you said i was going to be a millionaire. and you are going to help!
richard, take it easy.
no offense, but for a person who says she is lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. money is power.. money makes people respect you...
how come you never ask me any important questions? do not you wonder if there is going to be a nuclear war? or a cure for cancer? what about your family? what about people?
I am curious, but i do not want to know. jeez, i hope you have not been telling people what is going to happen to them.
give me some credit, will you?
good. you are discreet. i like that in a partner.
wbat're you talking about?
look it is very simple. you tell me everything that has not been invented yet, and I will invent it. we will be partners. fiftyfifty.
sixtyforty.
you are taking advantage of a minor.
when do we start?
ah. this is a biggie. forget sneakers. running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
come on. you can not be serious.
there are major fortunes to be made here. leisure time and lifestyles.
are you talking ~about exercise? like gym?
not for you. okay, there is lots more.
you do not have to use pig latin! nobody could possibly know what we are talking about.
all right. these are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, walkmans, digital watches and miniature tv's.
oh.	and huge portable radios. everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous.
richard! they do not have any! they never heard of them! is not that wonderful?
what are you talking about?
the wave of the future! I have decided on our first fortune! I will see you later. you just think high tech.
high tech. i like the sound of that.
what do you know about classical music?
nothing.. selling is selling.
charlie. about last nights..
forget it. I have been thinking. girls must go through that stuff too. sometimes when i look at you i feel like an animal. maybe my dad's right. teenagers are nuts.
but I am not. I am a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you could not possibly understand.
yeah, i know. girls mature faster than guys. but last night, i was the one who put on the brakes. and you know why?
why?
because nothing else matters. that is the great thing about love. every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and i know that I am not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. cause you are my baby and i love you.
what am i going to do with you?
do not be cruel to a heart that is true.
hi, dad.
doing some shopping?
for me?
open it.
i closed my christmas club.
good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
i wanted to apologize for this morning.
it is hard to believe you are going to be eighteen.  want an eskimo pie? or a creamsicle? I would come home from the store and there is little you running up to me. I would give you a dime and you would promise never to grow up.
quiet today?
this morning was good.
the hat business is in trouble.
i, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? you are worried about my business?
yes.
that is very thoughtful, honey. it is just a slump. things will pick up.
but when john f. kennedy's elected president, men'1l stop wearing hats.
kennedy's a catholic. he will never win.
he will win.
richard nixon's going to be president. nixon wears hats.
you think this'll cheer dad up?
of course, he will love it. you are a terrific artist.
i do not need your charity. i do not need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money -how could you do that?
please do not shout.
does everybody have to hear?
i want everybody to hear because i do not have anything to be ashamed of.
jack, i was just trying to help.
we will make it, we will be fine.
all right. what is the scoop?
on what?
how come we are your best friends and we had to find out about you and michael fitzsimmons from dolores?
she is unbelievable. who needs satellites when we have got dolores's mouth?
i hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
that is disgusting!
) oh, maddy, grow up. it says in love without fear that "the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it". page eightysix.
did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
just what you underlined.
you are kidding...? carol, you have beautiful hair.
come on. what is with you and michael?
yeah. he is so cool and mysterious.
he is very interesting. for all his pretending to be a tough guy, he is really got the soul of a poet.
i bet dolores told charlie.
that loudmouthed little bitch~
peggy sue!
you better watch out for her. she is after charlie.
cool it kids. he is free to see other girls, if he wants.
but i always thought that you would marry charlie, carol would marry walter, and i would marry arthur. we would all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every sunday. it will spoil everything if you and charlie break up. that michael does not look like the barbecue type.
I am not going to marry him. i just went out with him once.  i know! why do not we go to the movies tonight. just us girls. it will be fun.
do not be silly. it is saturday. date night!
yeah. I have got to go. arthur's picking me up soon.
okay. but let's have a girls night soon. maybe a pajama party.
are not we a little old for that?
ta da! pantyhose! the death of the garter belt! of course, once they are manufactured they will look better than this. what do you think?
this is your great invention?  would you wear those things?
would they go over my girdle or under?
instead of a girdle. and light as a feather.
that is all well and good, but we do not have the money to manufacture them.
you need a partner. there is a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, mr. fitzsimmons. I have invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
is not that awfully forward?
we have got to move fast. this is an idea whose time has come.
you mean to tell me that you invited this mr. fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
wrong, dad. your idea.
charlie. i just had the strangest dream.
i have to talk to you..
what are you doing here?
let's go down to the basement.
i want to know what is going on. dolores told me that you and that scuzzball michael fitzsimmons...
i bumped into him after you dropped me off last night. i did not feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
then it is true, dammit! i had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. when the monotones did "book of love  chapter four you break up, will not you give it just one more chance..." I am thinking did we break up? 'cause if we did, i do not even know about it!. i thought we cleared all that up yesterday. did that maynard g. beatnik give you what you wanted?
you know i never could stand your sarcasm.
you are going to blow it, peggy sue. nobody treats charlie bodell like this.
and why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like napoleon? how come it always turns into an argument with you?
look, I have got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, i got the car. I am the lead singer, I am the man.
charlie,. I have been trying to postpone this. but what is the point? it is over.  i do not want to hurt you. this is very hard for me. I am doing this for both of us. i really want you to be happy.
i will be happy if i have you. i love you.
that will not make any difference. we just can not live together. and you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo janet.
what are you talking about? who is janet?
i just can not trust you anymore.
what about everything i said to you this afternoon...
that is just it. you can always get to me. there is this window in my heart and every time i leave it open, you climb in. unless i close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
but what has to be different?
everything. i have a good head for business, i should be franchising the bakery. and i want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you will go to college. and finish.
what! what about the group and my singing career? what about me?
I am trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
you do not know zip! you think I am going to end up selling appliances like my father? chasing women around the store. I have got to give it a shot. why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? until yesterday you loved me and you loved us.  ) what the hell has changed? for two years I have done nothing but love you. I will show you, I am going to be just like fabian!
hi, richard.
what are you doing?
jogging. i was running, now I am jogging.
that is what you were talking about yesterday? everybody does that in the future?
yep. it is going to be a law.  i broke up with charlie last night.
that is terrific. you did it. you really changed the course of your destiny.
it was an unfair fight. he did not have a chance. I am taking a real gamble. i loved him for a long, long time.
cheer up. now you can give some other guy a shot. make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
for god's sake, forget the money! I am going crazy! I am a walking anachronism. I am a puddle of deja I am worried about my kids, scott must be scared to death, i think my daughter's doing drugs again. i can not have any fun here, i do not have that innocence any more. i can not keep all this in anymore. i feel like I am going to explode.
look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. may i make a suggestion?
like what?
suggestion! hypnotic suggestion! why did not i think o~ that before?
what do you know about hypnosis?
everything. this is perfect. the subconscious mind remembers all. you can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. maybe that will give us a clue on how to get you back.
look, I am desperate. I will try anything. but what if you can not snap me out of it?
no offense, but you are pretty out of it now.
you are completely relaxed. when i count to three, you will open your eyes. one... two... three.  we will start with something easy. what is your name?
peggy sue kelcher.  or, peggy bodell.  I am not sure.
oh boy. peggy, what are microchips?
ah..... they are very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
what will they be made of?
i think it is called silicon. charlie told me that.
silicon is from sand.
we were lying in the sand. it was my eighteenth birthday... we were so awkward... i would have married him anyway...
in the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
no. the pill will change all that. then he would not have blamed me. we were just too young.
you mean you will give a girl a pill and she will want to have sex?
no. the pill will be for birth control. but girls do like sex. maybe not the first time.
will you take of f your blouse?
yes, every day.  maybe i should not have worn that dress? i told beth it was a bad idea. that is why they made me queen.
no! yes! I will be right out, dad.  oh shit! peggy, I am going to snap you out of it.
i could not help it  i loved him.
one... two... three.  you are now awake.
richard! you should be ashamed of yourself.
me? you went crazy! you started taking your clothes off. i was putting them back on for you.
that is just perfect is not it? did it work? did you find out why i came back?
i think it has something to do with your birthday. you were rambling. i did not understand the rest.
god dammit! how'm i going to got out of here?
hey! do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? i usually charge for hypnosis.
oh, go feel up your hamsters! i hear rodents put out.
you know, dear, i think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please do not stay out all night. just tell us. we will believe you.
mom, how about a machine that is like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
no, just a friend of mine. i do not think he likes jello.
what does charlie think about that?
you know mom, it is okay to have male friends. besides, it is over with me and charlie.
what? when did it happen? your dad and i always expected you two to get married.
yeah, i know peggy sue gets married. case closed. period. mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? get married and settle down after high school?
that was quite an evening. bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.
i should not have put you through that. it must have been agony. let's do something.
five more weeks of school. and ten minutes past graduation I am gone.  to freedom.
for everyone.
now listen, this is the plan. as soon as school is finished we go to utah and...
utah? i thought you would be going to new york or paris. what is in utah?
rita. i met her last summer. she is cool. you will really dig her. she is got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of provo where she raises chickens. I will write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
i can not do that.
why not? polygamy's legal in utah.
i hate chickens.
but what about the other night? we were like two stars in the same constellation.
michael, you and i are light years apart. you should go, but not with me.
but we had heat baby. passion! fire! we owe it to ourselves to fuse together.  at least one more time.
that is a terrific line. you are going to be a wonderful writer.
you think so?
yes. we had a glorious night together. one day you will remember and write about it.
i can dig that. bittersweet perfection. dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
it is charlie!
what a treat.
ssh. he is great.
peggy sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
i thought i knew everything about him.
can we split now?
i can dig you being uptight about rita and utah. that is cool. but I have got to warn you about something.
what?
my father. he is not just the ultimate square. he is a total crook.
how did it go with the pantyhose?
it is the darndest thing. ed knew what they were immediately. as a matter of fact, he said he is got a product like that in development right now.
oh no!
did not call, them pantyhose, though. what was it, evelyn?
sheerotards. catchy name, is not it? like leotards.
he is a liar! he has no such thing! it is my own fault. i should have had it patented first. he is a crook, damnit.
peggy sue, watch your mouth.
mr. fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
oh, you are both so naive.
look young lady, i grew up through the depression. i fought in the second world war. six days a week i get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. and on the seventh day, when god rests, i do not have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
what are you doing here?
i wanted to talk to you, and i have one last thing to take care of at school. then I am going to...  good dog, rusty. good dog.
rusty's dead. that is ajax
oh. i guess i always liked rusty better.  could you give me a ride to school?
sorry, the blue thunder's out of commission for a while.
well, how about a walk, charlie bell..
how did you know about that?
i was at lena's last night. you were terrific.
not terrific enough. what were you doing in that part of town? who were you with?
what were you doing there? you never told me you were singing with an r and b group.
hey. i guess there is a lot of things we do not know about each other.
I would forgotten how much music meant to you.
that is real big of you.
stop being defensive. i want to help you. i wrote a song for you.
you are kidding. you wrote a song? is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
not exactly, but with your great voice, it will be a huge hit. honest.
fat chance. you know, lee wilkins came to hear me last night. he told me to forget it. you told me to forget it. my parents tell me to forget it.
just take a look at it.
if you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I will take a look at it. but I am beginning to think that maybe there is more to life than music. i wonder if people would still like me if i stopped being mr. excitement?
does this mean you like me again?
it means i care about you and what happens to you.
that is all i wanted to hear. 'cause I am never going to give up on us. it is easy to fall apart in a crisis. it is easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. but this is more than love. this is a mental decision. just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. then you will understand.
what is the matter?
it is that jerk walter.
what happened?
after charlie told walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, walter decided he should do the same thing.
welcome to the singles' scene.
what a i going to do for the rest of my life? i do not have a boyfriend anymore.
look, carol, maybe walter's done you a big favor. you always said you wanted to get out of town. go for it. and be happy, goddamnit, I am rooting for you.
sorry. these fountain pens are so tricky.
oh! you did that on purpose! i hate you. go gargle with razor blades!
i beg your pardon?
take a long walk on a short pier.
have a nice day.
what is up?
i think you should give up diving. it is dangerous.
do not be silly, I am the best in the county.
i know you are, but you have to stop. i could not tell you before, i did not know if i should. but you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
i spend three hours a day practicing. i have trainers, i know what I am doing.
but accidents can happen.
not to me they don't. I am going to win the state, then the. nationals, and then I am going to the olympics.
rosalie, please, listen to me! you have to stop.
you are sick. you should go to the nurse. I am going to tell miss dennis.
what is the matter?
it is all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
not true.  i think I am making real progress on the microchip.
you were meant to. you are one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. i have to get out of here.
forget it, it will never work.
okay. listen, i cancelled the tickets for fabian. i thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, chez tres.
hello, lilla!
peggy sue!
quite a bit more rain than usual this year. i hope it does not spoil the rhubarb.
I have already got some in. i was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  how would you like that?
fine.  ) grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
that is a day's work. but if that is what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
you know, peggy sue, your mother said you had a dream that i died.
i wish she hadn't.
I am not afraid. i know exactly when I am going to die.
what is it going to be, elizabeth? seventyfive? eighty?
I am not telling.
I have been trying to drag it out of her for years.  you know, dreams are fascinating business. 'specially where you see the future.
do you believe in all of that?
well, i like to speculate. this book I am reading right now, a woman in colorado says she lived in ireland a hundred and fifty years ago. her name was bridey murphy- and she gives names and dates and where she lived. she was hypnotized. big bestseller.
i remember that book!  grandpa, grandma, i want to tell you something.
if you believe it, darling, then i believe. being young can be just as confusing as being old. the things that happened to me fifty years ago are more on my mind than what happened yesterday.
but I am remembering the future.
right now you are just browsing through time. choose the things you will be proud of. the things that last.
my children make me happy. i miss them so much.  beth. scott and beth.  I am going to name my daughter after you.
it is going to rain again. every time i wash the car, it rains.
that never changes.  you know, when you and grandma are gone, the family's gone. i never see the cousins anymore.
it is your grandma's strudel that is kept this family together.
grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
I would take better care of my teeth.
what is peggy sue going to do at your lodge meeting?
it is her 18th birthday, i want to show her off.
it was my idea, grandma. i always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
he will not tell me, but I have got my suspicions. and i do not want any of that. do not keep her out late.
let's go.
goodbye, grandma.
what does grandma think you do at your meetings?
stag movies. smokers.
i may be an old fool, but i think we can help you.
i hope so. at least i got to see you and grandma.  has it ever worked before?
the last one was six hundred years ago. it is about time for another one.
do you have to wear that hat?
it would not be a lodge without hats.
what the hell did you do that for? what are you doing here?
i was trying to save you. they were going to vaporize you.
do not be ridiculous! they are just a bunch of harmless old men. my grandfather was in there.
you are going to listen to me.
let me got! where are you taking me?
right here. now sit down.
look. i wanna tell you. i forgive you for everything. i know what you have been going through. you are just scared. i was scared, too, but I am not anymore.
how could you possibly know what I have been going through?
what do you mean you and my father decided? who the hell are you to plan my life? let's get married and live happily ever after. bullshit. i got knocked up. i had to marry you. i never had a choice.
what?
you betrayed me, charlie. you were never there for me or the children. and now you come and tell me, "peggy, you are scared." of course I am scared. if you knew what i knew you would be scared shitless.
you are crazy! you are really out of your mind!
i might be crazy, but I am not crazy enough to marry you twice. there is a lot of things i can not change. i can not even think about them. i tried. but i could not even help rosalie.  i do not want to be bitter. I am a naturally optimistic person. but you took advantage of that.
will you take me back to my grandparents?
of course.
oh, charlie.
it opens, too. look inside.
i love you.
i know.
i think we should get out of here. it is going to rain.
do you think anybody in the fifties ever made love on a bed?
what the hell is that?
peggy! where are you going? come back!
I have got to go now.
but i love you. I will love you forever.
I will love you, too, charlie. I will love you for twenty years.
come back to me.
I am trying.
. peggy sue, i love you, and i need you peggy sue...
charlie? was i dead?
i thought you were...for a while.
you look awful, like you have not slept in days. and so old.
but happy. very happy, peggy sue.
charlie, i thought i knew everything about you.
i wanted to apologize. i can not live without you.
what about janet?
that is over. i got tired of translating everything. she thought the big hopper was a hamburger.
it could not be me.  i hardly knew him.
I will just set it right here.
charlie, i had a strange experience.  i went back to high school. and i spent a lot of time with you.  and you and walter and leon were singing "i wonder why".
oh, god, dion.
you were terrific.  and i kept trying to push you away but you would not give up.
I will never give up.
then hold me.
i loved you since the day i met you, and i have not stopped.
do not try to charm me, charlie bodell.
listen, i do not expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. but i would do what i can...
i came to say goodbye.
goodbye? where are you going? what about our partnership? I am making real progress with the microchip.
you were meant to  you are one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
so are you. you have got a vision.
vision? I am a walking anachronism! I have upset my parents. i miss my kids. i could be trapped here forever! and poor charlie...i got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. tomorrow's my birthday! I have got to get out of here now.
did you break up with charlie?
yeah, yeah. I am taking a big gamble. I have loved him for a long, long time.
okay. why do not we do something visionary. change your destiny, peggy sue. change your destiny and marry me.
no! no! no! peggy sue got married! case closed. i do not want to marry anybody. goodbye richard.
wait! I will go with you!
you can't. you are going to be valedictorian.
