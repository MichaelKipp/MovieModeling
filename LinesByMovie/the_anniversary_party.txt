no luck.
oh, well, we'll just have to try again. sound like a plan?
happy anniversary, baby.
happy anniversary.
i love you.  most beautiful woman in the world.
hardly...
accept a compliment.
i think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
what did you get me?
in the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.
kiss the back of my knees.
through the sweats or not?
not.
what?
you didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
no.  did you?
no.  i missed that.
i missed all of you.  we're okay, aren't we?
we're great.
i mean, you're really back.
for good.
don't get it.
well, it might be clair.  they're threatening not to come...
what?
they can't find a sitter...  hello?  excuse me?  yes, uh, hold on.  just a moment.  it's skye davidson.  she needs directions to the house.  you invited skye fucking davidson to our anniversary party?
okay.  i'm sorry, look, i meant to tell you.  it was the only chance i had to meet her.
you invited her to our anniversary party? i didn't even invite my mother.
she goes on location tomorrow.  sally, i'm sorry.  look, i can't keep her on hold.
no, no of course not.  it's skye fucking davidson, for fuck's sake.
you want me to uninvite her?
no, no of course not.  how old is she? twenty-fucking-two?
and she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
skye!  i'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  you read the book again?  well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. we tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  if you're coming from laurel, you want to take sunset west, we're just past will rogers state park.  three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  it's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.
i'm looking forward to meeting you, too. and skye, i'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. eternally grateful, really.
i'm going to throw up.
i can't imagine anyone else playing genna.
really?
promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
i'll say as little as possible.
i know we're early, we're so early. sorry.
you have to sign your taxes anyway.
of course we do.  we have to sign our taxes.
you can never be too early or too thin.
we have a gift?
thanks, i'll take that.  champagne?
lovely.
we closed.
fantastic.  out here.
joe officially owns no. 4, cheyenne walk, chelsea, london, england.  no small doing.
i love you, you're a genius.
i suppose.  sally, that's quite a gift. i'm not sure it's in your best interest.
i adore him.
the realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  the house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the london flat.
i know.  i know that.  don't spoil it.
what you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in london, it's an outrageously expensive city.
we've only been over this how many times?
you only made half your quote this year.
well, you're a tower of support.
i worry because you don't.  it's my job. i'm feeling guilty.  i would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
we couldn't be on more solid ground.
whatever you say.  listen, i love you.
otis!  no barking!
and joe's huge in europe.  he's like a rock star in london.  his novels sell millions.
not millions.
he's directing now.
they're paying him scale.
he gets huge advances on his novels. he's going back to that.  you know how he hates it here.
there's still time to undo this.
we'll be fine.
did you invite them?
the roses?  and of course they said yes.
that was the plan.  and you're thrilled to have them.
whatever you say.
did you tell joe to behave?
yes.
did he promise?
scout's honor.
before i forget.  put it on the bookshelf.
you're out of your mind.
just do what i say, alright?
how much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
beats a lawsuit.
i love gifts.  what did you guys get us?
nothing that can't be exchanged.
oh.  well.  good.
congratulations on the deal.  how exciting.  is sally doing sally?  i mean it's sally.  the character that's based on sally.  the character that's based on sally in the book.
the novel.  no, skye davidson is playing the lead.
oh my god, i'm a huge skye davidson fan. she's very beautiful.
yes, she is.
but i am right, yes?  she's based on sally.
it's a novel.
still.  well.  let's drop it.
yes.
i'm not much of a reader, but i do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  mostly non-fiction.  did you read the new styron?
no.
it's very good.  i understand you won the booker prize.
yes i did.
is your script much like the novel? jerry says it's very good.  but you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" you know?  i sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  don't you find?
don't i find what?
i don't know why joe, we've known each other how long...
not long.
don't be silly.
joking.
yes i know.  i started to say... i started to say joe that --
do i put you off?
you manage to throw me off balance.  i adore you.
and i you.
but i'm always afraid i'll say something stupid.
ah.
and so i always manage to, do you see? like the book/script thing, do you see?
mmm hmmm.
jack.  did you compose that yourself?
absolutely.
had a little help?
absolutely not.
it has your ring.
i'm not that good.
cal, my wife judy.
nice to meet you.
enough about me.
evie has a little something for you.
in the kitchen.
who'd like to go and find otis?
the infamous dog?
he's the best dog in the world.  they're both coming tonight.  not my idea.
ours.
it's jerry's worst idea.
what's that?
the neighbors from hell.  the kind that lay in wait.  i'd rather move actually. wouldn't i?  wouldn't i?
yes.
okay.  last one to find otis is a smelly old bum.
please, ryan.
no, he's absolutely right.  you're absolutely right, ryan.  dog talk must be banned.  canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us.  can i get you a drink?
something soft.
right away.  are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, ryan?
hi.  monica and ryan?
sally?
yes.  and you've met joe.
yes.
well, so glad you decided to come.
we could hardly say no.
oh?
thank you.  this was so unnecessary.  i hope you've noticed that otis isn't barking as much.  we keep him in at night.
at 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  i have it on tape.
you're keeping a record, are you?
it's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
ryan.
i'm sure you understand.
well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always otis.
well today it was otis.  and you should keep him away from our yard.  because sheila will defend herself.
ryan!
are you working on a new book?
well, yes, actually.
he always has two or three going...
you lose this?
ah there's our snookums now.
well, not yet.  the gate was open?
it's taken care of.
hors d'oeuvres or something?
yes, great!  it's a beautiful house.
thank you.  i understand you're an interior decorator.
yes.
i so wish i'd known.
well, whoever did this is amazing.
i did it.
what a fucking day!  we only just got a sitter.  i don't know her from fucking adam.  she could be a serial killer.  i'm going to have to call every ten minutes. you have to let me give out the number.
of course.
she already has.
it's alright, isn't it?
of course it's alright.
clair is a hovering mother.
i'm not.
this is monica and ryan.  mac and clair.
why didn't you bring him?
what?
why didn't you bring him?
he's allergic.
oh.
to dander.  otis.
oh.
didn't i say?
well, probably.
they can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  he's got eyelashes yay long.  they must be a foot long.  the older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
oh.
so they tell me.  not soon enough, of course.  how are you, sal?  you look fantastic. it changes your life, you know.  a baby. it puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  doesn't it, mac?  you can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
it's an object lesson in grace.  wow!  look who's here before me!  my leading man is on time for once.
i'm the hired help.
fuck you.
i never put myself in harm's way.
anymore.
no, not anymore.  happy anniversary, scout.
oh my god!  america told me your neighbors are coming?
and here they are!
and she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over.  because you're both, so, what - introspective?  and you should have done it ages ago.  i'm sophia gold.  come meet my husband, cal.
monica and ryan.
rose.
he's a novelist.
ah.
like joe.
hmm.  where are my kids?
in the guest room.  i've laid out a paint table for them.
i hope they're watercolors!
nevermind.
would you like to meet my husband?
thanks for coming.
happy anniversary.  you're a good match, you two.  can you help me with this stuff?
that for us?
what a nose.  you missed your calling.
can i open it?
sally?
please?
you look so well, clair.  a wraith.
you think so!?  i've been working out a lot since the baby. and i've been working.  and that takes it's toll, you know.
i'm glad that's all over for me.
don't you miss it?
never.
really.
not for a second.  cal can have all that.
really?
so where is young jonah?
with a sitter.  we have a sensational sitter.  jonah's really comfortable with her.  you know, a second mom sort of. like part of the family.  amazing with kids.
what is that thing?
so this sitter can always reach me.  i'm still not used to leaving him.
you should have brought him.
dander.  he's allergic.  otis.
oh.  do you have any pictures?
pictures.  they're always in my tote.  i left my tote in the damn trailer.  but! he's mac all over again.  imagine mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  the fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
are you the funniest person i know, or what?
i can't think how you gave it all up, soph.
it sounds hysterical, but otis just rubbed up against me and i'd kind of like to change into something of yours.  you know it could be disaster.  he's so allergic.  it's terrifying.
borrow whatever you like.
i'll change back before we leave.
whatever you like.  i'm afraid it'll all be too big for you.  are you alright, clair?
i'm fine.  i'm fine.  well, i'm a little stressed.  and i've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
i'd say it was down.
and the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  i've got a ghastly headache, actually.
you want a tylenol, or something?
i'd love a xanex.  sally, please don't tell sophia that i'm not breast feeding.
why would she care?
you know sophia.  she's so damned judgemental.  and she's so damned... perfect.  and so fucking... serene.  just fucking don't tell her.  because you know mac thinks she's god.  and i can feel him comparing.
you need to knock off the pills, clair.
just don't fucking tell her.
it's not going to come up.
panes!  how are you?
oh, you know, i am.
has she called?
she'll never call again.  she called last week to tell me she'll never call again. where's sally?
good, you brought your violin.  i want you to play.
it's a machine gun.  i thought i'd kill myself.
are you lovesick?
suicidal.  it's much less codependent.
will champagne help?
not enough.
panes is here!
oh great.
how do you do, skye?
oh, i love that.  i'm just great.  i'm so happy to be here. and i apologize for invading you.  and i'm so happy you asked me to.  i'm so touched.  i know how private you and sally are.
yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
when i read your work i felt that you knew me.  women must tell you that.  and this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  i am genna.  how many women must tell you that.  and the script is wonderful.  wonderful and lean and visual...
i'm so happy you like it.  i'm so relieved you said yes, and i'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
you're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.
she's even better looking in the flesh.
really?  i need a drink.  come hide with me.
oh, jesus, panes.  i can't, i can't believe that bitch is in my house.
you don't know she's a bitch.
she's all over him, are you blind?
it could be worse.
how?
she could be playing the role in joe's movie that should be yours.
fuck you, panes.
you see, that's worse.
i just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
like your business managers?
they're not just our business managers, panes.
oh, okay, forgive me.  your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
exactly what i mean.  it's all ruined.
it's not ruined, for fuck's sake.  it's one of your parties.
i don't want it to be just one of our parties.
"how are you really doing, panes?" "lousy, thank you, i'm falling apart."
like the last time.
no.  no, not like the last time.  she was the rest of my life.
like the last time.
i wasn't finished.
okay.
"we can't stand seeing you like this, panes.  i hate you being alone.  why don't you stay with us for a while?" "i'd love to, thanks."
it's our anniversary, panes.
i didn't hear me say tonight.
we're just feeling our way back.
"otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."
you know it's true.
oh my god, sorry.  i'm interrupting.
i'll be right out.
come on in.
i'm in the same room with sally nash.  oh my god.  you're my icon.  i've been watching your films since i was a little girl.  like, four years ago i followed you all around the beverly center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.
i don't think i ever spent half a day in the beverly center.
whatever, do you remember?  i've seen all your movies.  when i was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  they said you were too real.  i worship you.  and i couldn't be more flattered, because i know the part i'm playing in joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
and i'm overwhelmed.  and i want to do it justice.  and i hope we can spend time together.  and i'm gushing.  it's my worst quality.
not at all.
oh my god.  i've been so rude.  i'm skye davidson.  has anyone ever told you, you look like peter sellers?
no, never.
everyday.
i'm levi panes.  will you excuse us, skye?  it's time for sally's meds.
thank you, thank you, thank you.
my god, your wardrobe is incredible.  it took me forever to decide.  oh, and i found dr. x, thank you.  you saved my life.
shit!
i'd cut off her red wine if i were you.
shit.  it's my galiano.
what does that mean?
about five thousand dollars.  with my discount.
directing suits you.
i'm not so sure.  look again in three months.
it must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
ow!  gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
just did.  jealous?
when does he graduate high school?
oh, very jealous.
i saw lucy when i was in london, she seems okay.  it's hard to tell with her.
shit, i forgot to call her back.  she's off on a trip somewhere.  oh god, my grandad's flat in london's been sold.
in cheyene walk?  lucy's going to have a meltdown.  oh, i'm so sorry.
i should have damn well bought it.  well, we can't afford it.  the movie's going to eat up a year of my life and i'm getting paid next to nothing.  do you know how much skye davidson's getting?  four million.
yeah, but i hear she gives a mean blow job.
you really need to be fucked.
so how are you really doing, panes?
why don't you go fuck yourself?
no.  really.  for real.  really.
i'm worried about your galiano.
you're a shit.
no, really, five thousand with your discount.
how's the movie going?  your movie.  you are making a movie, aren't you?
yes.  fine.
that's it?  yes.  fine?
i don't want to talk about it.
why not?
i never like to talk about my work.
alright.  well, that's something new.
no.  not something new.
well, something's wrong.
nothing's wrong.  it's great, okay? having the time of my life.  mac's a fantastic director.  and what can anyone say about cal that hasn't been said.  and it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
um.  happy for you.
thanks.
so tell me, how's it going?
oh you know.  no doubts.  no second thoughts.  am i a monster?
you're my best friend.
that's not an answer, is it?
yes, you're a monster.
thank you, panes.
you don't need to thank me.
we're going to have to go back out there.
i guess.
let me.  i'm jeffrey.
monica.
and you know our friends, how?
we live next door.
oh.  you're them.
excuse me?
we've heard lots about you.
you have?
your eames table is incredible.  and the b&b.  i just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
you're an interior decorator, right?
sally did all this herself?
in fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  so things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  and it keeps changing.
mmm.  it says something about the two of you maybe.
yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  i see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
oh, yes.  you know ryan's been sober eight years.  and it's difficult if i... you know.  it's better if i don't.
uh-huh.
i'm a little nervous, so...
oh.
a little out of my element.
no you're not.
well, yes.  yes, in fact.  a little on the outside, yes.  and there's been all this friction.
hm.
i don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
very well put.
i think a lot of this could have been avoided if sally made more of an effort.
what?
but you're very private people.  you know, there's a kind of elitism...
elitism?
the wrong word, maybe.  delete that. and, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
and you know, he really does not.
and ryan works at home.
and your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  and i've come this close to suing you for harassment.  and you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you.
oh shit.  i'm sorry.
well, that's what ryan thought.  i was more generous, actually.
oh shit.  i'm sorry.  i'm a total fucking maniac.  delete all that, okay?  i spoke for myself, this needn't rub off on my wife.  oh shit.  i get pissy sometimes. much worse than otis.  otis doesn't bite. it's just, i really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot. we live in a canyon.  we hear dogs barking at night, too.  and it's not otis.
easy tiger.
alright.  please don't tell ryan i'm drinking.
scout's honor.
i'll be your best friend.
would you sign it for me.  i'm sure this is inappropriate.
we're way past inappropriate.
i need to leave you now.
i will treasure this.
sally!!!!
panes?
from jewish folk poetry, a song cycle...
what?
trust him.
i didn't know you had this.
oh.  well, yes.  it's extraordinary.  you think you could sign it for us?
absolutely.  you always wonder where your books end up.  why don't we use it?
can we... one at a time?  hold it down, and one at a time.  you're last, cal.
why last?
two minutes.
it's alright.  be our guests.
what's a sign for that?
come on, panes...
go.
hey!  would you?
it was fifteen seconds.
i don't think so.
are you always this much fun?
take your time, jer.
i'm ready.
time.  hey!  time.  judy!  time you guys. hey!!
ya vhol.  what are you, a fucking nazi?
well it's fucking time.
i didn't say a word.
time!
what was it?  what the fuck was it?
ryan's novel.
ryan's novel?
still champions.
panes is not on your team anymore.
what did i do?
panes is not on my team anymore.  i'll have panes if i like.
it's an unfair advantage.
you've got cal.  you've got gina.  you've got skye?  we're the leftovers.
okay, knock it off.
truce?
truce.
dinner.  don't be angry.
i'm not fucking angry, for god's sake.
so who won?
a triumph.  when did you get here?
ten, fifteen minutes ago.
why didn't you come in?
i hate the sight of blood.  you guys don't take prisoners.
is there space here?
yes.
do you need anything else?
no, no thanks.
i was impressed.
oh?
the charades.
thank you.
that was my clue.
oh?
the shostakovich.
really??
oh yes, indeed.  that was my clue, you see.
escape hatch.
escape hatch.  and dad was having a go about the garden.  something was misplanted...
not properly watered.
whatever!  you know how he gets.  well, he went absolutely bonkers.  lucy and i were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and i didn't fit any more. it was almost fatal.  and that, my dear friends, is the day...
so?
i love you, joe therrian.
you're not upset that i brought the dog?
would it make a difference?
anouk isn't like a dog, really.  more like a small person.  so is there anyone here for me?  no one looks new.  who's that?
you don't want that.  it's married and it's the neighbor.
oh i think he's cute.  how's the marriage part working out?
you're fucking desperate.
like you didn't know.  who invited the bimbo?
one guess.
happy anniversary.  thank you for making me a part of it.
what are they?
dolphins.  great.
it's ecstasy, sal.
i think there are sixteen there.
this is an amazing present.  what a sweetheart you are.
i think we should all take it tonight. everyone's staying, stays.  no driving. that's the rule.  i love you sally-mae. you're going to have a fabulous time.
i'm worried about my spine.  i'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
i love it here.  don't you love it here, ryan?  i love it here.  and i love tonight.  and i love these people.  and this feels utterly fantastic, ryan.  utterly fantastic.
you know what sally therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  she didn't pull that out of thin air.  it causes brain damage.  you'd better drink a lot of water.
do you want to go home, ryan?
yes.
i think you should then.  you should look in on sheila.
i'm not going to leave you alone.
they're really nice people, ryan. they're like us...
they're nothing like us.
i think you need to speak for yourself, ryan.  but i think you're really nice people...
are you making an ass of yourself?
there's only you, ryan.  you know what, ryan?  you're beautiful.  i love you so much... you need...
i don't need a drug.
you need a good review and you'll be fine.  the whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
ready to go?
i'm going to go get my swimsuit.  i do know, ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry.  ryan, you're a great man.
you got your dp?
what?  oh yeah, the camera man?  they gave me a list.
and you got skye davidson.  pretty big leagues for a first timer.  do you even like movies?
not particularly.  weird, isn't it?  god i'm rally up.  do you feel anything yet, mac?
kind of.  hey, look - john seale, oliver stapelton, darius khonji - they're friends.  and great dp's i could give them a call for you.
thanks, mac.  and thanks for being so supportive about all this.  i really love you, you know.
hey, i'm happy for you, buddy.  anything i can do.
god, i really need to jump about a bit.  how's your film going?
it's going.  it's going.
and how's the diva doing?
well, you know...good days, bad days.
i meant sally.
i meant sally.
oh.  you're serious.
no.  no.  let me tell you something.  directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood.  the sleep depravation alone.
oh don't.  everyone says that.
isn't this a fabulous picture?
yes.
she's such a great photographer.
hm.
so where should i put it?
i thought it was okay where it was.
it's much more personal in here.
a notch above the storage room.
we're always in here.  she really gets him, doesn't she?
the both of you.
but she really gets to the heart of joe, doesn't she?  she's a genius.
so how much do you hate her?
big time.
well, i don't trust her.  i never have.
she took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  you don't trust anyone.
i trust you.
oh soph...
you'll hate it in london.  it's wet and miserable.  a medical hellhole sally. it's socialized.  beds in the corridors. terrible plumbing.
and the food sucks, i know.
you are not having your baby in london. you're going to have your baby at cedars in beverly hills, america, delivered by dr. milton cohen.  period. and you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that lamase bullshit.  there's no excuse for pain like that.
sophia!  i'm not even pregnant!
well good.  thank god.
let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
oh honey, let's.
what do you mean, thank god?
well, are you sure about this baby thing? it's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
no, no, not at all... i mean i've still got plenty of time.  don't i?  i mean i still have a good six years, whatever. we could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  and i know i've always said i never wanted kids, and i didn't... but this year, i really, truly, feel ready...
honey, i'm not worried about you.  you are going to be a fantastic mom.  not an issue.  i pressed you, remember?  joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
oh soph, joe loves kids.  joe wants kids. joe thinks he needs kids.
he wants playmates.  oh he's a sweetheart, sal, you know i love him. but he's not going to be a good father. he's just not parenting material.
hey, let's sit down.  i bet the rug feels really nice against your skin.
don't try and change the subject.  oh god, it feels great!  he's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable.
and cal's this massive adult?
cal knows who he is.  did you notice how happy joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
you weren't exactly horrified.
i don't have a drug problem.
neither does joe.
his sister does.  big time.  and the new york times says addiction is genetic -- i'll e-mail you the article.
you don't have kids to keep a marriage together, sally.  it's only five months since joe came back.
we're fine.  we're great.  we're having a baby and we're moving to london.
well, you weren't fine last summer when you went sylvia plath on me in connecticut.
not nice.  not kind.
ha!  not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
why are you doing this?
his image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
but i am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
no you are not.  you're sally nash. listen to me, you're sally nash.  you're my best friend and i love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to london to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child.  "oh now i'm a novelist, oh now i'm a director..." english prick bastard joe therrian who's probably going to leave you for skye davidson anyway.
isn't skye amazing?
she's got great tits.
she's a constant surprise.
and you've only just met.
yeah, i know... but she's only twenty seven and...  the wisdom.  she's an old soul.  she knew that shostakovich thing.  did you notice?
absolutely.  and she's got great tits.
yeah, god she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
the camera loves her.  a great actress.
with great tits.  i'm going to ask her if i can touch them.
poor mac.  it's been a bit of a struggle. i'm sure sally's told you.
no, what?
the movie.
oh, she's really enjoying it.  i think. is mac okay?
i don't know what's going on.  i don't care to guess.  mac's really unhappy. she isn't there, that's all.  she's no idea what she's playing, not a clue.
who, sally?
and, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  she can barely get the lines out.  there was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  i know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, joe.  something's gone.  you know, that thing that was sally - that always surprised you.  it's gone.  i think she's scared.  and that's death.
i still think she sails above the rest. i mean not like her early films.  but those were all such great directors.
mac's a pretty great director, joe.  he's a woman's director.  and nothing's happening.  course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... but it was discussed.  he had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
what?
hey, listen, i love her.  she's sophia's best friend.  i never said any of this, alright.  i'll deny it on the stand...  you guys are gonna have kids.  that is so great.  maybe that's what this is all about.  maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  you know adults don't do this for a living.  you guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  sophia knew that intuitively.  look at clair. clair's a mess.  make sure she gets the epidural.  forget that natural childbirth shit. everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "life is but a walking shadow.  a poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." and speaking of me, the role of leo in your film?
leo?
any thoughts on casting yet?
leo?  it was out to jude law.  jude passed.
well, i can't make any promises, and of course i haven't read the script but i loved the novel...when are you shooting?
october-ish.
i have a small window of time.
leo.  leo's twenty-eight, cal.
scratch the two, write in a four.
scratch the two, write in a four.
you've got a lot of fucking gall.  thirty nine.
five years ago, i was at the party, remember?
i was faking it.  i've been feeling caged for sometime.  funny, huh?
no, it's not... fuck fuck fuck fuck.
jesus christ.
well...wow...
mac?  oh there you are.  what are you doing, honey?  no more work.  don't you feel breezy.
i'm in mourning.
you can cut around it, whatever it is. you always do.
not this time.
it's always not this time.  if you can do it around me, you can do it around anyone.
you don't have any clothes on.
how nice for everybody.  come swimming. the water's glorious.  you'll fix it.  you'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
or i won't.  i can't help her.  i'm out of my depth.
things always look much worse in the morning.
i don't know how to make her funny.
you're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  you won't care who's in your damn movie.
what what's about?
i...wait, what are you talking about?
are you okay?
i don't think so.  i feel.  i feel a bit funny.
let's go for a walk.
i've never done this before.
oh?  it's easy.  you just put one foot in front of the other... that's a good girl.
i'm a little in the puke zone.
here, drink this.  drink lots of water.  hold on to this.  take deep breaths. nice and slow.  would you like a lolly?
what am i, five?
you're never too old for a lolly.  i'm having one.
okay.
lemon or raspberry?
lemon.
lemon it is.
ryan's really angry with me.
i think he's really angry with me too.
it's really not the same thing.  he was really nicer when he drank.
i'm sorry.
eight years, though.  that's quite an accomplishment.
that's a lot of those.
medallions.
a lot of cakes.
yes.
and he doesn't smoke?
he has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? it's gotten much better.
how long have you been married?
nine...nine, yes?  nine years, just about.
you must have been a baby.
oh yes.  nineteen...just.  i'm cold.
come here.
that's very nice.
i like you.
i'm so glad.  you know, i recognize that passage in your book.  the bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
sorry?
i know you changed it to a bookstore. and the color of my hair.  but the moment was exactly the same.  the same, you know, dynamic.  and almost verbatim, wasn't it?
yeah, it was.  for a writer nothing's sacred.  no, nothing at all.
i think it's great that i made an impression at all, you know.
someone left the goddamn gate open.  otis got out.  skye and i, well the... i came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
oh for fuck's sake.  nobody uses that gate.
i'm sorry.
there's a goddamn sign on the gate.
i'm so sorry.
you fucking cow, can't you read?!
i...
how long ago was it?
stop being such a bitch, sal.
i'm so sorry.
it was a mistake.  this isn't a plot to do in otis.
don't be so sure.
listen to yourself...  don't worry, it's alright.  we'll find him.  what's wrong with you?
she left the fucking gate open.
well he can't have gone far.
can't have gone far?  he's like a greyhound.  he could be miles away.
he'll find his way back.
there are fucking coyotes out there.
sally, calm down.  we're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.
fuck you.
or shitty!!  otis!!
how long have you worked for the therrians?
a long time.
so you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
oh yes.
did you know the contractor?
very well.
was it a contractor?
it's the way they do things.
to code?
did you see permits?  did he have a license?
you should talk to mr. joe.
ryan, you've got to come!  you've got to help me find the dog!  i let their dog out.  we need to find the dog.
you're not serious.
i left the gate open and otis got out! he could get hit by a car!
god willing.
we have to find the dog, ryan.
why?
because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around.  because, god help you if something happens to that dog?
excuse me?
all the ugly phone calls?  we're not the only people with a tape recorder, ryan.  they've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the pch.
otis!!  shostakovich identified with the jew.  he felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of stalinist imperialism.
not to mention andrew zhdanov... otis, come!!
andre zhdanov?  how the hell do you know about andre zhdanov?
who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where zhdanov persecuted the leaders of soviet music - shostakovich, prokofieve, and myaskovsky.
i'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know.
do peter sellers again.
otis you crazy dog!  otis are you in this god forsaken canyon?  my people are very hungry.
i just did a movie about bob yar, i played gittle, the jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used shostakovich's 13th symphony.
set to the poem of yetveshenko!
exactly!  so i dug it, and i did a lot of research.
do you really, you really, like shostakovich?
yeah.
would you, like, marry him?
if he were still alive, maybe.
how about someone who really really liked shostakovich?
are you asking me to marry you?
no, i'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
very.
oh good, i'm worse... are you really twenty-two?
who told you that?  no.  i'm twenty...  five.
otis!!!!
otis!!!!
otis, good boy, come here.  oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
this is a nightmare.  we should have kept him upstairs.
it was done.  when sophia put the kids to bed, america brought otis in the room and closed the door.  it was done.
well someone clearly let him out before monica opened the gate.
oh fuck you, and fuck monica while you're at it.  but i guess that's what i interrupted.
jesus, sally.  you are a medical miracle. the only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
yeah, let's talk about that.  you seem to be rather an expert.  i don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
rave parties?!  that's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  perfect!
what else don't i know about, joe?  let's get really clear here.
sally, so i took a few pills.  i went out dancing.  i tried to forget how upset i was about splitting up with you.  i haven't lied to you.  i told you about the people i've slept with.  i just didn't mention the few occasions i took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental i knew i'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  sally, we're back, i love you.  trust that.  please let's not do this.
otis!  come!  good boy!  come!
otis!
i'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
love?
you walked out on a five year marriage.
that hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  it's whether we can live together... like this!  all the time.
it's not like this all the time.
do i want anyone else?  no.  do i want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  i'm trying.
and how hard it hit?
just stop right there, sally.  we've been through this.
you've been through it.  that's how you love people.  when it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  and second...
you want to talk about bullshit?  lucy called you three times this week.  she's a fucking mess, joe.  your sister is a fucking mess.  she needs you.  i talk to her more than you do.
that is not true.
it is true.  you know how you love, joe? you dedicate a book to someone.
every novel i've had published in every language i've dedicated to lucy.
right.  and when was the last time you spoke to her?
and how fucking dare you cast skye davidson in that part?  have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  i'm an actress!  it's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  everybody knows that...
it's a novel.
about me!
who the fuck do you think you are?  the part of genna is not just about you. it's about every woman i've ever loved in my entire life.  including my mother. the character is also clearly in her early twenties, sally.
what are you saying?
hello?  last birthday was?
i don't look my age, joe.
sally, i have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  and you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
it's a shit novel anyway.
well there you go.  i let you off the hook.  you're one goddamn lucky actress.
not really.  i mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  that's what all our friends think, anyway.
okay.  if we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. because i don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  and the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  that you don't have... oh christ, sally.
who?  who?  who thinks that?
your director and your co-star of your current movie.  don't dish if you can't take it, sally.
mac?  mac says it?  cal?
cal, too?
sally, for christ's sake.
anyone else?
this is insanity.  sally...
don't.
don't push me away.
i had an abortion two weeks ago.
don't do this.
i found out i was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
don't do this!
i told you when we met i never wanted children.  i don't want kids in my life. we talked about it.  you weren't listening.
you changed your mind.
i wanted you back.
you think this was to hurt you?!  my god, joe.  it isn't about you.
what?!  you aborted our child?!
i'm a monster.  exactly.
you're not ready.
don't make allowances.  i'll never be ready.  some people just shouldn't have children.  i'd be a terrible fucking mother, joe.  i did want it for us.  but i couldn't do it.  i don't really think i can do it.
i wasn't part of that picture at all, was i?  i wasn't part of that decision.  did i occur to you at all?  it's a fucking farce.  it's a fucking farce.  how long did you think you could keep it going. you're amazing.  do you have any idea what you've done to us?
yes.
i'll never forgive you.
i know.
i have no idea who you are.
he's okay, clair.  you wanna give him a little room?
man, i must really be stoned.  thanks, buddy.
i'm fine, babe.
give him a minute, clair.
hey.  thanks, buddy.
anytime, sport.
yeah, thanks pal.
i'm fine, babe.  i'm gonna take a little walk.  i need a minute.  let's forget it. my life didn't pass in front of my eyes. so, it probably wasn't that close.
probably not.
so, you've got lifeguard papers, or what?
there's a test, you know.
forget it, judy.
honey?
i'll be fine.  really babe.  give me a minute.
are you my big brave boy?  are you my brave hero?
you're crazy baby.  i love you.
are you my big hard hero?
do you want me to save you?  do you want me to save you?
oh yeah...
oh yeah... i'm gonna save you.
oh yeah?
let me heal you, baby.
oh jesus oh jesus oh jesus.
what is it?
let's go upstairs, okay?
the suspense is killing me.
harry called.
and?
lucy overdosed.
but she's alright.
she's in icu.
stupid tart.
she left a note.
fuck you.
you need to call your dad.
leave us alone right now.
i've booked you a flight and packed you a bag.  you just need to get into a car and go.
would you leave us alone right now?
i love her too, joe.
alright, good.  thanks for your trouble. so will you leave sally and me alone right now?
everybody hates the messenger.
i can't got tonight.  i don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight.
i'll be with you.
i don't want to go tonight.
you don't have to.
how's he doing?
not good.
he's gonna miss his flight.
yeah.
is he not going?  i booked a flight.
he's not going tonight.
i told his father he'd be on that flight.
well you could tell him otherwise.  it was good of you to be all this help.  but he doesn't want to go tonight.
jesus, sally.  i'm not the enemy.
and you're not the wife.
it's not a contest.
damn straight.
let's get the kids.
oh my god, the sitter.
i call that a perfect day.
a perfect night.
damn near.  and a damn near perfect drug.
hm.  we should do it again.
just every once in a blue moon, you know.
hm.  you think we should ask them for their landscaper?
hm.  do you like fucking out of doors?
not as a rule.
they didn't sign their goddamn tax returns!
take good care of it.
count on it.
jesus christ, it's a fucking dog!
don't go in, ryan.
what?
let's just go home, okay?
coffee?
sure.
i'll do it.
you don't need to do that.
i don't mind...
relax.  you've done enough.
no.
okay.
pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
i guess.
life gets messy.  ugly messy.  but i don't understand you.  and i don't think i ever understood lucy.  i don't understand throwing it away.  how do you throw all that away?  any of it.  i want it all.  you guys want guarantees?  i want the possibilities.  and all kinds of crap comes with that.  a lot of bad shit. and i think that's okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  all the good shit.  all the surprises.  it's a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  we'd have had amazing children, you and me.  we'd have had a ride.  you'd have surprised yourself.  i'll never love anybody else, you know.
me too.
that's under lock and key.
me too.
happy anniversary.
it's a calder.
i know.
he's my favorite.
i know.  it's for the baby's crib.
ah...
they're the keys to your grandad's flat. happy anniversary, baby.
oh, sally mae...
i know.
will you make love with me?
sure.
