no luck.
oh, well, we will just have to try again. sound like a plan?
happy anniversary, baby.
happy anniversary.
i love you.  most beautiful woman in the world.
hardly...
accept a compliment.
i think you are the most beautiful woman in the world.
what did you get me?
in the morning, after everyone's gone and there is just us.
kiss the back of my knees.
through the sweats or not?
not.
what?
you did not kiss anyone else's knees, did you?
no.  did you?
no.  i missed that.
i missed all of you.  we are okay, are not we?
we are great.
i mean, you are really back.
for good.
do not get it.
well, it might be clair.  they are threatening not to come...
what?
they can not find a sitter...  hello?  excuse me?  yes, uh, hold on.  just a moment.  it is skye davidson.  she needs directions to the house.  you invited skye fucking davidson to our anniversary party?
okay.  I am sorry, look, i meant to tell you.  it was the only chance i had to meet her.
you invited her to our anniversary party? i did not even invite my mother.
she goes on location tomorrow.  sally, I am sorry.  look, i can not keep her on hold.
no, no of course not.  it is skye fucking davidson, for fuck's sake.
you want me to uninvite her?
no, no of course not.  how old is she? twenty-fucking-two?
and she is a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
skye!  I am so glad you are able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.  you read the book again?  well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it is not filmic. we tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just was not filmic... well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  if you are coming from laurel, you want to take sunset west, we are just past will rogers state park.  three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  it is about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.
I am looking forward to meeting you, too. and skye, I am thrilled that you are willing to take this leap with me. eternally grateful, really.
I am going to throw up.
i can not imagine anyone else playing genna.
really?
promise you will be nice to the neighbors.
I will say as little as possible.
i know we are early, we are so early. sorry.
you have to sign your taxes anyway.
of course we do.  we have to sign our taxes.
you can never be too early or too thin.
we have a gift?
thanks, I will take that.  champagne?
lovely.
we closed.
fantastic.  out here.
joe officially owns no. 4, cheyenne walk, chelsea, london, england.  no small doing.
i love you, you are a genius.
i suppose.  sally, that is quite a gift. I am not sure it is in your best interest.
i adore him.
the realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  the house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the london flat.
i know.  i know that.  do not spoil it.
what you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in london, it is an outrageously expensive city.
we have only been over this how many times?
you only made half your quote this year.
well, you are a tower of support.
i worry because you don't.  it is my job. I am feeling guilty.  i would have liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
we could not be on more solid ground.
whatever you say.  listen, i love you.
otis!  no barking!
and joe's huge in europe.  he is like a rock star in london.  his novels sell millions.
not millions.
he is directing now.
they are paying him scale.
he gets huge advances on his novels. he is going back to that.  you know how he hates it here.
there is still time to undo this.
we will be fine.
did you invite them?
the roses?  and of course they said yes.
that was the plan.  and you are thrilled to have them.
whatever you say.
did you tell joe to behave?
yes.
did he promise?
scout's honor.
before i forget.  put it on the bookshelf.
you are out of your mind.
just do what i say, alright?
how much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
beats a lawsuit.
i love gifts.  what did you guys get us?
nothing that can not be exchanged.
oh.  well.  good.
congratulations on the deal.  how exciting.  is sally doing sally?  i mean it is sally.  the character that is based on sally.  the character that is based on sally in the book.
the novel.  no, skye davidson is playing the lead.
oh my god, I am a huge skye davidson fan. she is very beautiful.
yes, she is.
but i am right, yes?  she is based on sally.
it is a novel.
still.  well.  let's drop it.
yes.
I am not much of a reader, but i do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  mostly non-fiction.  did you read the new styron?
no.
it is very good.  i understand you won the booker prize.
yes i did.
is your script much like the novel? jerry says it is very good.  but you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" you know?  i sometimes think we are better off not reading the novel at all.  because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we are going.  do not you find?
do not i find what?
i do not know why joe, we have known each other how long...
not long.
do not be silly.
joking.
yes i know.  i started to say... i started to say joe that --
do i put you off?
you manage to throw me off balance.  i adore you.
and i you.
but I am always afraid I will say something stupid.
ah.
and so i always manage to, do you see? like the book/script thing, do you see?
mmm hmmm.
jack.  did you compose that yourself?
absolutely.
had a little help?
absolutely not.
it has your ring.
I am not that good.
cal, my wife judy.
nice to meet you.
enough about me.
evie has a little something for you.
in the kitchen.
who would like to go and find otis?
the infamous dog?
he is the best dog in the world.  they are both coming tonight.  not my idea.
ours.
it is jerry's worst idea.
what is that?
the neighbors from hell.  the kind that lay in wait.  I would rather move actually. would not i?  would not i?
yes.
okay.  last one to find otis is a smelly old bum.
please, ryan.
no, he is absolutely right.  you are absolutely right, ryan.  dog talk must be banned.  canine conversations are completely discouraged... it is really good of you to join us.  can i get you a drink?
something soft.
right away.  are you sure you would not like something soft, ryan?
hi.  monica and ryan?
sally?
yes.  and you have met joe.
yes.
well, so glad you decided to come.
we could hardly say no.
oh?
thank you.  this was so unnecessary.  i hope you have noticed that otis is not barking as much.  we keep him in at night.
at 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  i have it on tape.
you are keeping a record, are you?
it is just very distracting when you are trying to work.
ryan.
I am sure you understand.
well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it is not always otis.
well today it was otis.  and you should keep him away from our yard.  because sheila will defend herself.
ryan!
are you working on a new book?
well, yes, actually.
he always has two or three going...
you lose this?
ah there is our snookums now.
well, not yet.  the gate was open?
it is taken care of.
hors d'oeuvres or something?
yes, great!  it is a beautiful house.
thank you.  i understand you are an interior decorator.
yes.
i so wish I would known.
well, whoever did this is amazing.
i did it.
what a fucking day!  we only just got a sitter.  i do not know her from fucking adam.  she could be a serial killer.  I am going to have to call every ten minutes. you have to let me give out the number.
of course.
she already has.
it is alright, is not it?
of course it is alright.
clair is a hovering mother.
I am not.
this is monica and ryan.  mac and clair.
why did not you bring him?
what?
why did not you bring him?
he is allergic.
oh.
to dander.  otis.
oh.
did not i say?
well, probably.
they can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  he is got eyelashes yay long.  they must be a foot long.  the older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
oh.
so they tell me.  not soon enough, of course.  how are you, sal?  you look fantastic. it changes your life, you know.  a baby. it puts everything in perspective, does not it.  does not it, mac?  you can not be the center of your own world, anymore.
it is an object lesson in grace.  wow!  look who is here before me!  my leading man is on time for once.
I am the hired help.
fuck you.
i never put myself in harm's way.
anymore.
no, not anymore.  happy anniversary, scout.
oh my god!  america told me your neighbors are coming?
and here they are!
and she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over.  because you are both, so, what - introspective?  and you should have done it ages ago.  I am sophia gold.  come meet my husband, cal.
monica and ryan.
rose.
he is a novelist.
ah.
like joe.
hmm.  where are my kids?
in the guest room.  I have laid out a paint table for them.
i hope they are watercolors!
nevermind.
would you like to meet my husband?
thanks for coming.
happy anniversary.  you are a good match, you two.  can you help me with this stuff?
that for us?
what a nose.  you missed your calling.
can i open it?
sally?
please?
you look so well, clair.  a wraith.
you think so!?  I have been working out a lot since the baby. and I have been working.  and that takes it is toll, you know.
I am glad that is all over for me.
do not you miss it?
never.
really.
not for a second.  cal can have all that.
really?
so where is young jonah?
with a sitter.  we have a sensational sitter.  jonah's really comfortable with her.  you know, a second mom sort of. like part of the family.  amazing with kids.
what is that thing?
so this sitter can always reach me.  I am still not used to leaving him.
you should have brought him.
dander.  he is allergic.  otis.
oh.  do you have any pictures?
pictures.  they are always in my tote.  i left my tote in the damn trailer.  but! he is mac all over again.  imagine mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet.  the fact is they probably did not even need me for this birth.
are you the funniest person i know, or what?
i can not think how you gave it all up, soph.
it sounds hysterical, but otis just rubbed up against me and I would kind of like to change into something of yours.  you know it could be disaster.  he is so allergic.  it is terrifying.
borrow whatever you like.
I will change back before we leave.
whatever you like.  I am afraid it will all be too big for you.  are you alright, clair?
I am fine.  I am fine.  well, I am a little stressed.  and I have been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
I would say it was down.
and the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy.  I have got a ghastly headache, actually.
you want a tylenol, or something?
I would love a xanex.  sally, please do not tell sophia that I am not breast feeding.
why would she care?
you know sophia.  she is so damned judgemental.  and she is so damned... perfect.  and so fucking... serene.  just fucking do not tell her.  because you know mac thinks she is god.  and i can feel him comparing.
you need to knock off the pills, clair.
just do not fucking tell her.
it is not going to come up.
panes!  how are you?
oh, you know, i am.
has she called?
she will never call again.  she called last week to tell me she will never call again. where is sally?
good, you brought your violin.  i want you to play.
it is a machine gun.  i thought I would kill myself.
are you lovesick?
suicidal.  it is much less codependent.
will champagne help?
not enough.
panes is here!
oh great.
how do you do, skye?
oh, i love that.  I am just great.  I am so happy to be here. and i apologize for invading you.  and I am so happy you asked me to.  I am so touched.  i know how private you and sally are.
yeah, well, it is just us and a few hundred of our closest friends.
when i read your work i felt that you knew me.  women must tell you that.  and this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  i am genna.  how many women must tell you that.  and the script is wonderful.  wonderful and lean and visual...
I am so happy you like it.  I am so relieved you said yes, and I am really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you.
you are going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.
she is even better looking in the flesh.
really?  i need a drink.  come hide with me.
oh, jesus, panes.  i can't, i can not believe that bitch is in my house.
you do not know she is a bitch.
she is all over him, are you blind?
it could be worse.
how?
she could be playing the role in joe's movie that should be yours.
fuck you, panes.
you see, that is worse.
i just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
like your business managers?
they are not just our business managers, panes.
oh, okay, forgive me.  your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
exactly what i mean.  it is all ruined.
it is not ruined, for fuck's sake.  it is one of your parties.
i do not want it to be just one of our parties.
"how are you really doing, panes?" "lousy, thank you, I am falling apart."
like the last time.
no.  no, not like the last time.  she was the rest of my life.
like the last time.
i was not finished.
okay.
"we can not stand seeing you like this, panes.  i hate you being alone.  why do not you stay with us for a while?" "i'd love to, thanks."
it is our anniversary, panes.
i did not hear me say tonight.
we are just feeling our way back.
"otherwise, we would insist on your being here."
you know it is true.
oh my god, sorry.  I am interrupting.
I will be right out.
come on in.
I am in the same room with sally nash.  oh my god.  you are my icon.  I have been watching your films since i was a little girl.  like, four years ago i followed you all around the beverly center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.
i do not think i ever spent half a day in the beverly center.
whatever, do you remember?  I have seen all your movies.  when i was in rehab, the second time, they would not even let us see your drug addict movie.  they said you were too real.  i worship you.  and i could not be more flattered, because i know the part I am playing in joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
and I am overwhelmed.  and i want to do it justice.  and i hope we can spend time together.  and I am gushing.  it is my worst quality.
not at all.
oh my god.  I have been so rude.  I am skye davidson.  has anyone ever told you, you look like peter sellers?
no, never.
everyday.
I am levi panes.  will you excuse us, skye?  it is time for sally's meds.
thank you, thank you, thank you.
my god, your wardrobe is incredible.  it took me forever to decide.  oh, and i found dr. x, thank you.  you saved my life.
shit!
I would cut off her red wine if i were you.
shit.  it is my galiano.
what does that mean?
about five thousand dollars.  with my discount.
directing suits you.
I am not so sure.  look again in three months.
it must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
ow!  gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
just did.  jealous?
when does he graduate high school?
oh, very jealous.
i saw lucy when i was in london, she seems okay.  it is hard to tell with her.
shit, i forgot to call her back.  she is off on a trip somewhere.  oh god, my grandad's flat in london's been sold.
in cheyene walk?  lucy's going to have a meltdown.  oh, I am so sorry.
i should have damn well bought it.  well, we can not afford it.  the movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I am getting paid next to nothing.  do you know how much skye davidson's getting?  four million.
yeah, but i hear she gives a mean blow job.
you really need to be fucked.
so how are you really doing, panes?
why do not you go fuck yourself?
no.  really.  for real.  really.
I am worried about your galiano.
you are a shit.
no, really, five thousand with your discount.
how is the movie going?  your movie.  you are making a movie, are not you?
yes.  fine.
that is it?  yes.  fine?
i do not want to talk about it.
why not?
i never like to talk about my work.
alright.  well, that is something new.
no.  not something new.
well, something is wrong.
nothing's wrong.  it is great, okay? having the time of my life.  mac's a fantastic director.  and what can anyone say about cal that has not been said.  and it is great working with friends, blah blah blah.
um.  happy for you.
thanks.
so tell me, how is it going?
oh you know.  no doubts.  no second thoughts.  am i a monster?
you are my best friend.
that is not an answer, is it?
yes, you are a monster.
thank you, panes.
you do not need to thank me.
we are going to have to go back out there.
i guess.
let me.  I am jeffrey.
monica.
and you know our friends, how?
we live next door.
oh.  you are them.
excuse me?
we have heard lots about you.
you have?
your eames table is incredible.  and the b&b.  i just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
you are an interior decorator, right?
sally did all this herself?
in fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  so things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  and it keeps changing.
mmm.  it says something about the two of you maybe.
yeah, we are in a constant state of flux.  i see you have moved up from the soft stuff.
oh, yes.  you know ryan's been sober eight years.  and it is difficult if i... you know.  it is better if i don't.
uh-huh.
I am a little nervous, so...
oh.
a little out of my element.
no you are not.
well, yes.  yes, in fact.  a little on the outside, yes.  and there is been all this friction.
hm.
i do not know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
very well put.
i think a lot of this could have been avoided if sally made more of an effort.
what?
but you are very private people.  you know, there is a kind of elitism...
elitism?
the wrong word, maybe.  delete that. and, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
and you know, he really does not.
and ryan works at home.
and your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  and I have come this close to suing you for harassment.  and you are only here because we are supposed to be sucking up to you.
oh shit.  I am sorry.
well, that is what ryan thought.  i was more generous, actually.
oh shit.  I am sorry.  I am a total fucking maniac.  delete all that, okay?  i spoke for myself, this need not rub off on my wife.  oh shit.  i get pissy sometimes. much worse than otis.  otis does not bite. it is just, i really love my dog and he does not really bark a lot. we live in a canyon.  we hear dogs barking at night, too.  and it is not otis.
easy tiger.
alright.  please do not tell ryan I am drinking.
scout's honor.
I will be your best friend.
would you sign it for me.  I am sure this is inappropriate.
we are way past inappropriate.
i need to leave you now.
i will treasure this.
sally!!!!
panes?
from jewish folk poetry, a song cycle...
what?
trust him.
i did not know you had this.
oh.  well, yes.  it is extraordinary.  you think you could sign it for us?
absolutely.  you always wonder where your books end up.  why do not we use it?
can we... one at a time?  hold it down, and one at a time.  you are last, cal.
why last?
two minutes.
it is alright.  be our guests.
what is a sign for that?
come on, panes...
go.
hey!  would you?
it was fifteen seconds.
i do not think so.
are you always this much fun?
take your time, jer.
I am ready.
time.  hey!  time.  judy!  time you guys. hey!!
ya vhol.  what are you, a fucking nazi?
well it is fucking time.
i did not say a word.
time!
what was it?  what the fuck was it?
ryan's novel.
ryan's novel?
still champions.
panes is not on your team anymore.
what did i do?
panes is not on my team anymore.  I will have panes if i like.
it is an unfair advantage.
you have got cal.  you have got gina.  you have got skye?  we are the leftovers.
okay, knock it off.
truce?
truce.
dinner.  do not be angry.
I am not fucking angry, for god's sake.
so who won?
a triumph.  when did you get here?
ten, fifteen minutes ago.
why did not you come in?
i hate the sight of blood.  you guys do not take prisoners.
is there space here?
yes.
do you need anything else?
no, no thanks.
i was impressed.
oh?
the charades.
thank you.
that was my clue.
oh?
the shostakovich.
really??
oh yes, indeed.  that was my clue, you see.
escape hatch.
escape hatch.  and dad was having a go about the garden.  something was misplanted...
not properly watered.
whatever!  you know how he gets.  well, he went absolutely bonkers.  lucy and i were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and i did not fit any more. it was almost fatal.  and that, my dear friends, is the day...
so?
i love you, joe therrian.
you are not upset that i brought the dog?
would it make a difference?
anouk is not like a dog, really.  more like a small person.  so is there anyone here for me?  no one looks new.  who is that?
you do not want that.  it is married and it is the neighbor.
oh i think he is cute.  how is the marriage part working out?
you are fucking desperate.
like you did not know.  who invited the bimbo?
one guess.
happy anniversary.  thank you for making me a part of it.
what are they?
dolphins.  great.
it is ecstasy, sal.
i think there are sixteen there.
this is an amazing present.  what a sweetheart you are.
i think we should all take it tonight. everyone's staying, stays.  no driving. that is the rule.  i love you sally-mae. you are going to have a fabulous time.
I am worried about my spine.  I am very worried about my brain and my spine.
i love it here.  do not you love it here, ryan?  i love it here.  and i love tonight.  and i love these people.  and this feels utterly fantastic, ryan.  utterly fantastic.
you know what sally therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  she did not pull that out of thin air.  it causes brain damage.  you would better drink a lot of water.
do you want to go home, ryan?
yes.
i think you should then.  you should look in on sheila.
I am not going to leave you alone.
they are really nice people, ryan. they are like us...
they are nothing like us.
i think you need to speak for yourself, ryan.  but i think you are really nice people...
are you making an ass of yourself?
there is only you, ryan.  you know what, ryan?  you are beautiful.  i love you so much... you need...
i do not need a drug.
you need a good review and you will be fine.  the whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
ready to go?
I am going to go get my swimsuit.  i do know, ryan, this is non addictive so you must not worry.  ryan, you are a great man.
you got your dp?
what?  oh yeah, the camera man?  they gave me a list.
and you got skye davidson.  pretty big leagues for a first timer.  do you even like movies?
not particularly.  weird, is not it?  god I am rally up.  do you feel anything yet, mac?
kind of.  hey, look - john seale, oliver stapelton, darius khonji - they are friends.  and great dp's i could give them a call for you.
thanks, mac.  and thanks for being so supportive about all this.  i really love you, you know.
hey, I am happy for you, buddy.  anything i can do.
god, i really need to jump about a bit.  how is your film going?
it is going.  it is going.
and how is the diva doing?
well, you know...good days, bad days.
i meant sally.
i meant sally.
oh.  you are serious.
no.  no.  let me tell you something.  directing's the best preparation possible for fatherhood.  the sleep depravation alone.
oh don't.  everyone says that.
is not this a fabulous picture?
yes.
she is such a great photographer.
hm.
so where should i put it?
i thought it was okay where it was.
it is much more personal in here.
a notch above the storage room.
we are always in here.  she really gets him, does not she?
the both of you.
but she really gets to the heart of joe, does not she?  she is a genius.
so how much do you hate her?
big time.
well, i do not trust her.  i never have.
she took our wedding photos, for chrissakes.  you do not trust anyone.
i trust you.
oh soph...
you will hate it in london.  it is wet and miserable.  a medical hellhole sally. it is socialized.  beds in the corridors. terrible plumbing.
and the food sucks, i know.
you are not having your baby in london. you are going to have your baby at cedars in beverly hills, america, delivered by dr. milton cohen.  period. and you are getting that epidural right away, do not let anyone talk you into any of that lamase bullshit.  there is no excuse for pain like that.
sophia!  I am not even pregnant!
well good.  thank god.
let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
oh honey, let's.
what do you mean, thank god?
well, are you sure about this baby thing? it is not the ticking clock shit, is it?
no, no, not at all... i mean I have still got plenty of time.  do not i?  i mean i still have a good six years, whatever. we could have three kids yet, if we wanted.  and i know I have always said i never wanted kids, and i didn't... but this year, i really, truly, feel ready...
honey, I am not worried about you.  you are going to be a fantastic mom.  not an issue.  i pressed you, remember?  joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
oh soph, joe loves kids.  joe wants kids. joe thinks he needs kids.
he wants playmates.  oh he is a sweetheart, sal, you know i love him. but he is not going to be a good father. he is just not parenting material.
hey, let's sit down.  i bet the rug feels really nice against your skin.
do not try and change the subject.  oh god, it feels great!  he is just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable.
and cal's this massive adult?
cal knows who he is.  did you notice how happy joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
you were not exactly horrified.
i do not have a drug problem.
neither does joe.
his sister does.  big time.  and the new york times says addiction is genetic -- I will e-mail you the article.
you do not have kids to keep a marriage together, sally.  it is only five months since joe came back.
we are fine.  we are great.  we are having a baby and we are moving to london.
well, you were not fine last summer when you went sylvia plath on me in connecticut.
not nice.  not kind.
ha!  not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
why are you doing this?
his image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
but i am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
no you are not.  you are sally nash. listen to me, you are sally nash.  you are my best friend and i love you more than anyone, and you are not going to move to london to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child.  "oh now I am a novelist, oh now I am a director..." english prick bastard joe therrian who is probably going to leave you for skye davidson anyway.
is not skye amazing?
she is got great tits.
she is a constant surprise.
and you have only just met.
yeah, i know... but she is only twenty seven and...  the wisdom.  she is an old soul.  she knew that shostakovich thing.  did you notice?
absolutely.  and she is got great tits.
yeah, god she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can not wait to work with her.
the camera loves her.  a great actress.
with great tits.  I am going to ask her if i can touch them.
poor mac.  it is been a bit of a struggle. I am sure sally's told you.
no, what?
the movie.
oh, she is really enjoying it.  i think. is mac okay?
i do not know what is going on.  i do not care to guess.  mac's really unhappy. she is not there, that is all.  she is no idea what she is playing, not a clue.
who, sally?
and, you know it is not rocket science, this script.  she can barely get the lines out.  there was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  i know crying's easy for her but it is a fucking comedy, joe.  something is gone.  you know, that thing that was sally - that always surprised you.  it is gone.  i think she is scared.  and that is death.
i still think she sails above the rest. i mean not like her early films.  but those were all such great directors.
mac's a pretty great director, joe.  he is a woman's director.  and nothing's happening.  course he will not fire her, because of the friendship... but it was discussed.  he had to battle his studio to get her in the first place.
what?
hey, listen, i love her.  she is sophia's best friend.  i never said any of this, alright.  I will deny it on the stand...  you guys are going to have kids.  that is so great.  maybe that is what this is all about.  maybe she does not want to do this anymore.  you know adults do not do this for a living.  you guys are going to have your kids, you will be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  sophia knew that intuitively.  look at clair. clair's a mess.  make sure she gets the epidural.  forget that natural childbirth shit. everything's going to be what it is supposed to be.  "life is but a walking shadow.  a poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." and speaking of me, the role of leo in your film?
leo?
any thoughts on casting yet?
leo?  it was out to jude law.  jude passed.
well, i can not make any promises, and of course i have not read the script but i loved the novel...when are you shooting?
october-ish.
i have a small window of time.
leo.  leo's twenty-eight, cal.
scratch the two, write in a four.
scratch the two, write in a four.
you have got a lot of fucking gall.  thirty nine.
five years ago, i was at the party, remember?
i was faking it.  I have been feeling caged for sometime.  funny, huh?
no, it is not... fuck fuck fuck fuck.
jesus christ.
well...wow...
mac?  oh there you are.  what are you doing, honey?  no more work.  do not you feel breezy.
I am in mourning.
you can cut around it, whatever it is. you always do.
not this time.
it is always not this time.  if you can do it around me, you can do it around anyone.
you do not have any clothes on.
how nice for everybody.  come swimming. the water's glorious.  you will fix it.  you will come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
or i won't.  i can not help her.  I am out of my depth.
things always look much worse in the morning.
i do not know how to make her funny.
you are coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you will not even remember what it is about.  you will not care who is in your damn movie.
what what is about?
i...wait, what are you talking about?
are you okay?
i do not think so.  i feel.  i feel a bit funny.
let's go for a walk.
I have never done this before.
oh?  it is easy.  you just put one foot in front of the other... that is a good girl.
I am a little in the puke zone.
here, drink this.  drink lots of water.  hold on to this.  take deep breaths. nice and slow.  would you like a lolly?
what am i, five?
you are never too old for a lolly.  I am having one.
okay.
lemon or raspberry?
lemon.
lemon it is.
ryan's really angry with me.
i think he is really angry with me too.
it is really not the same thing.  he was really nicer when he drank.
I am sorry.
eight years, though.  that is quite an accomplishment.
that is a lot of those.
medallions.
a lot of cakes.
yes.
and he does not smoke?
he has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? it is gotten much better.
how long have you been married?
nine...nine, yes?  nine years, just about.
you must have been a baby.
oh yes.  nineteen...just.  I am cold.
come here.
that is very nice.
i like you.
I am so glad.  you know, i recognize that passage in your book.  the bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
sorry?
i know you changed it to a bookstore. and the color of my hair.  but the moment was exactly the same.  the same, you know, dynamic.  and almost verbatim, was not it?
yeah, it was.  for a writer nothing's sacred.  no, nothing at all.
i think it is great that i made an impression at all, you know.
someone left the goddamn gate open.  otis got out.  skye and i, well the... i came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
oh for fuck's sake.  nobody uses that gate.
I am sorry.
there is a goddamn sign on the gate.
I am so sorry.
you fucking cow, can not you read?!
i...
how long ago was it?
stop being such a bitch, sal.
I am so sorry.
it was a mistake.  this is not a plot to do in otis.
do not be so sure.
listen to yourself...  do not worry, it is alright.  we will find him.  what is wrong with you?
she left the fucking gate open.
well he can not have gone far.
can not have gone far?  he is like a greyhound.  he could be miles away.
he will find his way back.
there are fucking coyotes out there.
sally, calm down.  we are not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical.
fuck you.
or shitty!!  otis!!
how long have you worked for the therrians?
a long time.
so you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence?
oh yes.
did you know the contractor?
very well.
was it a contractor?
it is the way they do things.
to code?
did you see permits?  did he have a license?
you should talk to mr. joe.
ryan, you have got to come!  you have got to help me find the dog!  i let their dog out.  we need to find the dog.
you are not serious.
i left the gate open and otis got out! he could get hit by a car!
god willing.
we have to find the dog, ryan.
why?
because we are nice people, and because what goes around comes around.  because, god help you if something happens to that dog?
excuse me?
all the ugly phone calls?  we are not the only people with a tape recorder, ryan.  they have gone to the canyon, we should go towards the pch.
otis!!  shostakovich identified with the jew.  he felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of stalinist imperialism.
not to mention andrew zhdanov... otis, come!!
andre zhdanov?  how the hell do you know about andre zhdanov?
who does not know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where zhdanov persecuted the leaders of soviet music - shostakovich, prokofieve, and myaskovsky.
I will tell you who does not know, cute girls do not know.
do peter sellers again.
otis you crazy dog!  otis are you in this god forsaken canyon?  my people are very hungry.
i just did a movie about bob yar, i played gittle, the jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used shostakovich's 13th symphony.
set to the poem of yetveshenko!
exactly!  so i dug it, and i did a lot of research.
do you really, you really, like shostakovich?
yeah.
would you, like, marry him?
if he were still alive, maybe.
how about someone who really really liked shostakovich?
are you asking me to marry you?
no, I am just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are.
very.
oh good, I am worse... are you really twenty-two?
who told you that?  no.  I am twenty...  five.
otis!!!!
otis!!!!
otis, good boy, come here.  oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
this is a nightmare.  we should have kept him upstairs.
it was done.  when sophia put the kids to bed, america brought otis in the room and closed the door.  it was done.
well someone clearly let him out before monica opened the gate.
oh fuck you, and fuck monica while you are at it.  but i guess that is what i interrupted.
jesus, sally.  you are a medical miracle. the only person who is ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.
yeah, let's talk about that.  you seem to be rather an expert.  i do not remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
rave parties?!  that is so typical - you would think it was called rage.  perfect!
what else do not i know about, joe?  let's get really clear here.
sally, so i took a few pills.  i went out dancing.  i tried to forget how upset i was about splitting up with you.  i have not lied to you.  i told you about the people I have slept with.  i just did not mention the few occasions i took drugs because you are so fucking judgmental i knew I would never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  sally, we are back, i love you.  trust that.  please let's not do this.
otis!  come!  good boy!  come!
otis!
I am not sure we understand that word in the same way.
love?
you walked out on a five year marriage.
that has not the first fucking thing to do with love.  it is whether we can live together... like this!  all the time.
it is not like this all the time.
do i want anyone else?  no.  do i want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I am trying.
and how hard it hit?
just stop right there, sally.  we have been through this.
you have been through it.  that is how you love people.  when it is easy for you, when it is convenient for you.
sally, first of all, you are talking bullshit.  and second...
you want to talk about bullshit?  lucy called you three times this week.  she is a fucking mess, joe.  your sister is a fucking mess.  she needs you.  i talk to her more than you do.
that is not true.
it is true.  you know how you love, joe? you dedicate a book to someone.
every novel I have had published in every language I have dedicated to lucy.
right.  and when was the last time you spoke to her?
and how fucking dare you cast skye davidson in that part?  have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I am an actress!  it is about our marriage for fuck's sake.  everybody knows that...
it is a novel.
about me!
who the fuck do you think you are?  the part of genna is not just about you. it is about every woman I have ever loved in my entire life.  including my mother. the character is also clearly in her early twenties, sally.
what are you saying?
hello?  last birthday was?
i do not look my age, joe.
sally, i have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  and you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.
it is a shit novel anyway.
well there you go.  i let you off the hook.  you are one goddamn lucky actress.
not really.  i mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  that is what all our friends think, anyway.
okay.  if we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still could not have got the thing made. because i do not mean anything as a director, and your name does not mean fuck all anymore.  and the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you are phoning it in.  that you do not have... oh christ, sally.
who?  who?  who thinks that?
your director and your co-star of your current movie.  do not dish if you can not take it, sally.
mac?  mac says it?  cal?
cal, too?
sally, for christ's sake.
anyone else?
this is insanity.  sally...
don't.
do not push me away.
i had an abortion two weeks ago.
do not do this.
i found out i was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
do not do this!
i told you when we met i never wanted children.  i do not want kids in my life. we talked about it.  you were not listening.
you changed your mind.
i wanted you back.
you think this was to hurt you?!  my god, joe.  it is not about you.
what?!  you aborted our child?!
I am a monster.  exactly.
you are not ready.
do not make allowances.  I will never be ready.  some people just should not have children.  I would be a terrible fucking mother, joe.  i did want it for us.  but i could not do it.  i do not really think i can do it.
i was not part of that picture at all, was i?  i was not part of that decision.  did i occur to you at all?  it is a fucking farce.  it is a fucking farce.  how long did you think you could keep it going. you are amazing.  do you have any idea what you have done to us?
yes.
I will never forgive you.
i know.
i have no idea who you are.
he is okay, clair.  you wanna give him a little room?
man, i must really be stoned.  thanks, buddy.
I am fine, babe.
give him a minute, clair.
hey.  thanks, buddy.
anytime, sport.
yeah, thanks pal.
I am fine, babe.  I am going to take a little walk.  i need a minute.  let's forget it. my life did not pass in front of my eyes. so, it probably was not that close.
probably not.
so, you have got lifeguard papers, or what?
there is a test, you know.
forget it, judy.
honey?
I will be fine.  really babe.  give me a minute.
are you my big brave boy?  are you my brave hero?
you are crazy baby.  i love you.
are you my big hard hero?
do you want me to save you?  do you want me to save you?
oh yeah...
oh yeah... I am going to save you.
oh yeah?
let me heal you, baby.
oh jesus oh jesus oh jesus.
what is it?
let's go upstairs, okay?
the suspense is killing me.
harry called.
and?
lucy overdosed.
but she is alright.
she is in icu.
stupid tart.
she left a note.
fuck you.
you need to call your dad.
leave us alone right now.
I have booked you a flight and packed you a bag.  you just need to get into a car and go.
would you leave us alone right now?
i love her too, joe.
alright, good.  thanks for your trouble. so will you leave sally and me alone right now?
everybody hates the messenger.
i can not got tonight.  i do not want to be on a plane on my own tonight.
I will be with you.
i do not want to go tonight.
you do not have to.
how is he doing?
not good.
he is going to miss his flight.
yeah.
is he not going?  i booked a flight.
he is not going tonight.
i told his father he would be on that flight.
well you could tell him otherwise.  it was good of you to be all this help.  but he does not want to go tonight.
jesus, sally.  I am not the enemy.
and you are not the wife.
it is not a contest.
damn straight.
let's get the kids.
oh my god, the sitter.
i call that a perfect day.
a perfect night.
damn near.  and a damn near perfect drug.
hm.  we should do it again.
just every once in a blue moon, you know.
hm.  you think we should ask them for their landscaper?
hm.  do you like fucking out of doors?
not as a rule.
they did not sign their goddamn tax returns!
take good care of it.
count on it.
jesus christ, it is a fucking dog!
do not go in, ryan.
what?
let's just go home, okay?
coffee?
sure.
I will do it.
you do not need to do that.
i do not mind...
relax.  you have done enough.
no.
okay.
pretty much a disaster, tonight, was not it?
i guess.
life gets messy.  ugly messy.  but i do not understand you.  and i do not think i ever understood lucy.  i do not understand throwing it away.  how do you throw all that away?  any of it.  i want it all.  you guys want guarantees?  i want the possibilities.  and all kinds of crap comes with that.  a lot of bad shit. and i think that is okay with me because, because of the rest of the stuff.  all the good shit.  all the surprises.  it is a fucking miracle when you come down to it.  we would have had amazing children, you and me.  we would have had a ride.  you would have surprised yourself.  I will never love anybody else, you know.
me too.
that is under lock and key.
me too.
happy anniversary.
it is a calder.
i know.
he is my favorite.
i know.  it is for the baby's crib.
ah...
they are the keys to your grandad's flat. happy anniversary, baby.
oh, sally mae...
i know.
will you make love with me?
sure.
