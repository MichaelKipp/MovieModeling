you will not be long?
I will join you shortly.
how long has this man been here?
three quarters of an hour.
mmmm. hodges, pierce come closer. mr. hill, take hold of the rope please. it is a machine accident. i expect you will be seeing a good deal of this.
abominable things these machines. one can not reason with them.
what a mess.
excuse me, mr. treves, sir.
yes?
i found it.
did you see it?
i say freddie, what are you about?
oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
are you the proprietor?
and who might you be, sir?
just one of the curious. I would like to see it.
i do not think so. no sir, we are closed.
I would pay handsomely for a private showing. are you the proprietor?
handsomely?... who sent you?
pardon me?
never mind. I am the owner.
so you will bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? mr...?
bytes. mr. bytes. he will be there.
I will send a cab. here is my card.
good lord, freddie! what have you got in there?
you will know presently. at the meeting of the society. but until then, i beg of you fox, keep it to yourself.
certainly, if you insist. you must have quite a find there.
i do not know what I have got.
nothing of any importance, eh?
you never mentioned his mental state.
he is imbecile, no doubt from birth. he speaks, but... it is all gibberish. no, the man's a homeless idiot...  i pray god he is an idiot.
did it go well, darling?
yes, very well, i think. are the girls in bed?
yes, and they send their kisses. would you like your sherry now?
no, i think a whiskey.
our man is sick. come right away.
what is it?
like this.
I will get my bag.
what did you do to him? he is been like this all night!
what do you mean?
he was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
i intend to.
what happened?
he fell.  he falls.
he must have taken quite a fall.
he is a clumsy git. never watches where he is going.
why is he sitting up like this? he needs rest.
that is the way he sleeps. if he lays down, he will die.  head's too heavy.
this man belongs in hospital.
can not you fix him up here? ...he's my livelihood. listen.
you listen, you are not going to have much of a livelihood if this man dies. he is got the rale, he is very weak, and i do not know how much damage has been done by his "fall". now stop wasting time and fetch a cab.
i like doing business with you. you and i understand each other, completely. i know i can trust you. can not i?
everything will be seen to.
good morning, treves.
good morning, sir.
you have acquired a taste for this?
it is quite nutritious, sir.
do not be mad. this muck can kill you.
do not be frightened. he will not hurt you.
indeed!
a hospital is no place for secrecy, mr. treves. doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. why was not this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? is he contagious?
no sir, he is got bronchitis and he is been badly beaten.
why is not he in the general ward, then?
well sir, he is quite seriously deformed, and i fear the other patients would find him... rather shocking.
deformed? is that it. then am i to assume that he is ultimately incurable?
yes sir.
what are your plans then, treves... you are aware that the london does not accept incurables. the rules are quite clear on that point.
yes, I am well aware of that. but this case is quite exceptional.
oh, is he a friend of yours?
no, more of an acquaintance.
i certainly sympathize with your problem, treves... why do not you try the british home, or the royal hospital for perhaps they would have a place for him.
yes sir, I will look into that.  would you like to meet him sir?
ah, mothershead. how are you feeling today?
fine.
good. excellent. now then, mrs. mothershead, i want you to come into this room with me. inside there is a man with a rather... unfortunate appearance.
I have heard.
yes... well, i want you to clear up a little mess, a breakfast tray was spilt. and bring up another breakfast. when you have done that, you and i shall give the man a bath. but, mothershead, I am counting on your many years of experience to get you through this, above all, do not scream, do not cry out, or in any way show this man that you are frightened of him...
sir, you do not have to worry about me. I am not the sort to cry out. shall we go in?
yes... yes, let's go in.
the workhouse.
yes! the workhouse!
good morning, mr. treves. it will be his bath-time soon. has he eaten?
not quite yet, mrs. mothershead. there seems to be some difficulty this morning.
will not come out, eh?
no, he is very upset about something.
just being obstinate, sir. I will handle it.
he is had his share of "smacks", mothershead. i expect that is what drives him under the bed. we must use patience and understanding with this man.
perhaps you have got the time for that, mr. treves, i certainly don't. I have got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. do not waste your time with him sir, it is like talking to a wall. i do not mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I will be back later for his bath. and mr. carr gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. good day sir.
yyyy... yyye... yyyess.
yes john!
...yyes
yyyess.
yyess.
that is much better. i could understand that "yes".
yes!
very good! oh yes! now listen. I am going to say some things to you and i want you to repeat them... um... i want you to say them back to me. do you understand? I am going to say some things to you and i want you to say them back to me. do you understand?
yes.
excellent! now, say... "hello"
hello...
my name is...
my... name is...
john merrick.
john... merrick
say "merrick".
merrick...
say "mmmerrick."
mmmerrick.
say "mmmerrick."
mmmerrick.
well, that is alright. i understand you. now, say the whole thing again, hello ...
hello... my name is... john merrick.
why, my dear mrs. mothershead, how good of you to join us. mr. merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
hello, my name is john merrick.
good lord, mr. treves!
we have made tremendous strides today, mothershead. he listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly is not easy for him.
parrots can do as much, mr. treves. it is all very nice, but i do not see the point. you know they will not let him stay here.
I am sure that if mr. merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they would see that he is the exception to their rule. now I am not expecting miracles. I am not saying he will be able to read or write, but i do think that i can get him to speak for himself. I am going to arrange things with carr gomm right now.  that was very good, john, very good. that is all for today. we shall do some more tomorrow. mothershead?
have you contacted the british home and the royal hospital?
ah, no sir. i had planned to see them in the morning.
good! how is the patient?
he is doing very well. in fact that is why i came to see you. i think that if i were to present mr. merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. if the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I am sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
a few words? i thought he was imbecile?
well sir, perhaps i should explain...
i really do not think that is necessary treves. I am quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
i do not agree. no one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. no doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
no, treves, it is out of the question. now if it was up to me, I would say "certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I am sorry, i simply can not speak for the other members of the committee.
then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
mr. treves, it is out of the question. i want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I am sorry.
i want my man back.
just a moment, how did you get in here?
never mind that, i want my man!
he is still very sick. please come downstairs with me. I will explain the situation.
don't... do not muck me about. you have had plenty of time to fix him up, and he is leaving with me, now. do you understand me? now, mr. treves. we had a bargain!
you misunderstood. this man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. he is my patient now and i must do what...
pull the other one, why do not you! we made a deal!
i know what you have done to him and he is never going back to that.
he is a freak! that is how they live. we are partners, him and i, business partners. you are willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood!
all you do is profit from another man's misery!
you think you are better 'n me? you wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. so i gave him to you. on trust, in the name of science! and now i want him back.
you do not own this man!
i want him back!
so you can beat him? so you can starve him? a dog in the street would fare better with you!
I have got my rights, damn you, and I am going to the authorities!
now i think we really do understand one another.
right... right.
singularly unpleasant chap... uh... i do not suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, mr. treves.
thank you very much sir. shall we say in a few days then?
shall we say two of the clock tomorrow afternoon?
wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir.
two of the clock then... you know treves... it seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance.
...yes, sir.
freddie?... freddie, do not look so discouraged.
i should not be. we made great progress today. i taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. he did rather well, too, but i had to lead him every step of the way. though frankly, at times i was unsure of who was leading whom.
what do you mean?
well, i was not sure whether he was parroting me because that is all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that is all i wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
but i thought you said that he was rather... simple?
he is. i mean, I have always thought he was. i think he must be. is he simple? or is that just something I have wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
i do not know. i can not explain it. if this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I am under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best i can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. but! if he is an imbecile, who is body i can not treat and who is mind i can not touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. they can put him where they will; he will not be bothered, i will not be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. and that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
perhaps you are just polishing a stone, endowing this elephant man with qualities he does not possess?
and what qualities are those? intelligence or stupidity?
I am sure i do not know, freddie.
I am sorry... i do not know either. i just do not know.
well, these things take time.
I have only got until two of the clock tomorrow afternoon, when carr gomm meets him. somehow, between now and then I have got to make john merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... why am i fooling myself? nothing short of john delivering the sermon on the mount is going to sway carr gomm...
the lord is my shepherd, i shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; he leadeth me beside still waters. he restoreth my soul: he guideth me in the paths of righteousness...
righteousness...
righteousness for his namesake.
very good, very good. now, when your visitor comes today i want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. i will introduce him to you and you will say the words you have learned. if you have any trouble with any of the words, I will help you. I am sure you will be just fine. if you do as well for him as you have done for me these last two days, then I am sure our visitor will be very pleased. now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? i will say "may i introduce you to mr. carr gomm." and you will say...
hello, my name is john merrick. i am very pleased to meet you!
it is only a physical problem. he has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. but he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. so if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I will make it clear.
speaking is one thing, treves, but can the man comprehend?
...as i said, it is only a physical problem... but i do feel that mr. merrick is very flattered that you are taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he is most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
he needn't. i have no desire to cause him any discomfort. did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
yes, i spoke to both the british home and royal hospital for incurables. I am afraid that they were not very encouraging, but they said they would bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
fine, fine. you know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, treves. but you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. just do not become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.
john, may i introduce you to sir carr gomm.
hello... my name is john merrick. i am very pleased to meet you.
how are you feeling today?
i feel much better. thank you for asking. and you?
I am feeling very fit, thank you. how is your bronchitis?
i feel much better. thank you.
are you comfortable here?
everyone has been very kind. i am extremely grateful.
mr. merrick likes the food here. do not you john?
oh yes! it is much better than what i am used to.
oh yes?
and what was that, john?
...yes potatoes... but...
but the variety of food here is very pleasing... i commend you.
...i... everyone has been very kind to me.
of course. how long did you and mr. treves prepare for this interview?
...everyone has been very kind.
yes, of course... well, it is been a pleasure meeting you, mr. merrick. good day.
it was a nice try, treves, but the man is so obviously mouthing your words.
yes, I am very sorry to have wasted your time, sir. i just felt that i had to do anything i could to protect him.
I am sorry too. he simply does not belong here. he is be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. believe me, frederick, it is better that it worked out this way. good day.
what is it, treves?
thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, thou anointest my head with oil...
how did you, know the rest? i never taught you the rest of it.
i do not understand.
tell me, john, how did you know the rest of the 23rd psalm?
it was a great pleasure to meet you, mr. merrick.
i am very pleased to meet you.
i hope we can talk together again sometime. good day.
treves. well done.
not me, sir. mr. merrick. he succeeded in spite of my shortsightedness.
why did you let me go on like that, teaching you what you already knew? why did not you tell me you could read?
you did not ask me.
i never thought to ask. how can you ever forgive me?
oh, no do not say that. you have been so kind to me. i was afraid to say too much. people always want me to be quiet. you wanted me to speak, but i was afraid. forgive me.
we do have a lot to talk about, do not we?
can you imagine what his life has been like?
yes, i think i can.
no you can't. you can not begin to know, no one can.
you are quite right, treves, this is an exceptional case. and i quite agree that the committee should see mr. merrick.
i could easily arrange...
no, not that way. broadneck and the others do not like to deal with patients directly. it makes them queasy... do you have any photographs of mr. merrick?
well, yes.
excellent. we shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. i want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. you and i shall vouch for his inner qualities.
do you think they will go along with us?
of course they will. they are reasonable men.
do not we?
no, we don't. their committees have informed me that they are unwilling to take mr. merrick, even if they were supplied with funds. they do not want him.
well, it is up to us then, is not it?
good evening. how are you feeling?
good evening. very well, thank you. and you?
very well, thank you. i have something for you, john. I am sure you will enjoy it, it is very popular.
this... is my new home?
yes.
the hospital?
of course! what did you think?
how long will i stay here?
i promise you. you will never see the inside of that horrible place again. you will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. it is a splendid room, do not you think?
has the response picked up?
frankly, treves, it is not what I would expected. a few small cheques. well- wishers. do not worry, these things undoubtedly take time.
but he is so afraid he is going to be carted off. I have promised him that will not happen.
well... I will let you know if there is something in the afternoon post.
please do.
feeling better now, mr. merrick?
yes.
thank you very much.
well, if there is nothing more, i suppose we will be leaving you now.
no, nothing.
you look splendid, john.
thank you very much.
when one is invited to tea, one must look one's best.
john... what is the matter? john... why are you upset?
I am not used to such kindness. from a beautiful woman.
mr. merrick, sugar?
yes please, two.
one or two?
two, please.
john loves the house.
do you?
oh yes. you have so many nice things, and so much room.
oh?
well, it is a lovely bedroom. what do you call that thing above the bed?
that is a canopy, john.
ohhh...
how is your tea, john?
it is very good. I am enjoying my visit with you very much. it is so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. I am sorry i made a spectacle of myself.
not at all, john.
i love the way you have arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. is that the way it is done in most houses?
oh yes.
who are they of?
oh, our relatives... the children.
the children! may i see?
of course.
the children. where are your children
oh, they are gone for the day... with friends.
friends. ah yes, friends! how nice.
and here is one of frederick's mother.
how lovely.
yes.
and here are my mother and father.
they have noble faces.
I have always thought that myself.
oh, yes.
would you... would you like to see my mother?
your mother?
here.
oh... why mr. merrick she is beautiful.
she has the face of an angel... she was an angel. she was so kind... so kind to me. it is not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I am sure i must have been a great disappointment to her.
oh no, mr. merrick. no. no son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
if only i could find her. if only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. you, mrs. treves, and you, mr. treves. then maybe she would love me as i am. I have tried to hard to be good.
good morning, mr. merrick.
good morning.
what? oh! i see! it is st. phillips. oh, of course. why... why that is very good, i mean you have gotten the windows and arches just right.
yes.
but it is so good, i mean... it is so very good.
thank you... very much.
where did you get this box?
the hallway? oh, the wastecan!
i meant no harm, it was the only place where i could find cardboard. i thought it has been thrown away.
it is alright, it was thrown away. no one wants it. it is just that it is a little dirty, that is all.
what is this?
the main spire.
the... oh, the spire! how silly of me, it is as plain as day... mr. merrick, where did you learn to do this?
...i learned a long time ago.
I will have to find some more.
yes... well, good day, mr. merrick.
good morning, john.
good morning.
john, there is someone here who would like to meet you. would that be alright?
john, I would like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the british stage, mrs. kendal. mrs. kendal, john merrick.
good day, mr. merrick.
good day...!
I have brought you some things. i hope you will like, mr. merrick. i hope you do not think it too forward.
oh, no.
i knew you would understand. here.
i want you to know that i do not go about giving my pictures to just anyone.
oh, no. i would never think it! it is so beautiful. you are so... I will give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.
she is very pretty, your mother.
yes.
mr. treves says that you are in the theatre. do you live there?
oh no, mr. merrick. i just work there.
well, even to work there would be wonderful. is it beautiful?
you have never been?
alas, no.
well you must go. it is one of the most beautiful places on earth. of course, I am rather partial.
tell me about it, please!
it is very difficult to put into a nutshell, but i should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. you may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. the theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, mr. merrick. it is lights and music, gaiety and joy. it's... well, it is romance.
romance!
that is one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. i have something else for you...
have you read it?
no, but i certainly shall.
have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
o, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. they pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
why, mr. merrick, you are not an elephant man at all...
oh no?
oh no... no... you are a romeo.
watery headed bunch.
i regret that i must leave you here, m' lord, m' lady. thank you so much for coming. it was an act of the greatest charity.
incredible, is not it? well, i think john has had enough visitors for one day, mothershead. I have got a lecture at the college, I will be back this evening.
excuse me, sir. I would like to have a word with you.
oh?... well, quickly please, mothershead, I am overdue.
i can not understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
now mothershead, you have to understand that this is very good for john. he relishes contact with people outside the hospital...
but you saw them, sir. they could not hide their disgust. they do not care anything for john, they are just trying to impress their friends.
are not you being just a little harsh, mothershead? you yourself hardly treated john with much loving kindness when he first arrived.
i bathed him, did not i? i fed him and cleaned up after him! if loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, i did treat him with loving kindness, and I am not ashamed to say it.
you are right, mothershead, please forgive me... of course, i appreciate everything you have done for john, and I am glad that you are concerned about his welfare. but, I am the physician in charge and i must do what i think best. I am also very late, so please forgive me.
when will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye? when will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky? when will the clouds be aweary of fleeting? when will the heart be aweary of beating, and nature die?
never, oh! never, nothing will die. the stream flows the wind blows the heart beats nothing will die.
mr. treves, there is something I have been meaning to ask you for some time...
yes, john?
...can you cure me?
no john, i can't. i can care for you, but i can not cure you.
i thought as much.
the cathedral is coming along nicely.
yes, soon i will start the main spire, but i must finish these columns first, how kind of her!
how blind of me. is there anything else, john, anything at all that i could get for you?
oh no! there is nothing! i have everything, you have given me everything i could possibly want. i am happy every hour of the day. i only wish there was something i could give to you.
please john, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. something just for yourself. is not there something you would like to have?
you want a dressing bag, john?
you do not think it is too gaudy, do you?
mr. treves, some more books arrived for mr. merrick.
thank you, mothershead. have a porter put them in my office.
yes sir.  what is that?
a dressing bag.
very smart indeed.
yes. john wants it.
a dressing bag?
you do not think it is too gaudy, do you.
well...
john thinks it is very dashing. something no gentleman should be without. I am inclined to agree.
you stay with me.
dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
more romances for john?
hmmm?
...freddie! what is the matter? you have been like this all evening.
oh... I have just been thinking about something that man bytes said.
oh, freddie. what could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
that i am very little different from him.
oh that is absurd, frederick. no, no frederick, that is all wrong! john is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. and, that is completely due to you.
but why did i do it? what was this all for? so john merrick could live out his last days in peace and comfort? or so i could become famous?
frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
...am i a good man or am i a bad man?
oh frederick.
do not you think this is a bit premature? we do not have the backing yet to...
steady on, treves. have a seat.
so you see, john, there is no need for a lighthouse. all your friends are here.
welcome home, john.
...my... home?
yes, john.
you did this for me?
yes.
please... please thank the governing committee for me. i will do my utmost to merit their kindness.
my home.
there is one more thing, john. here.
is it the one you wanted?
oh, mr. treves. mr. treves.
are you sure? because i can take it back.
mr. treves. thank you my... friends.
where is mr. merrick?
i... i do not know what you mean, sir.
do not lie to me. i know all about it. you were seen. where did you take him?
take him? now wait... i did not take him anywhere. we were just having some fun. we did not hurt him... just having a laugh, that is all.
he is gone!
when i left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
you bastard! you tortured him. you tortured him, you bastard. where is he?
you are not listening to me! i am not done nothing wrong. people pay to see your monster, mr. treves. i just take the money.
you are the monster! you are the freak! get out! you are finished!
you sly bastard. you are doing this to spite me, are not you!
aw, bytes, he is sick.
he is doing it to spite me, i tell you, and it is got to stop!
he is sick, bytes. he is going to die.
if he does it is his own fault! but I am not burying that swollen bag of flesh.
what are you going to do?
I will show you! I will show you!
don't!
shut up!
you alright?
y-y-yes--
want to come out?
you are english.
of course! you want out?
yes.
will not be a moment.
I am sorry i could only get you a third class ticket, but it is all we had.
oh no, my friend...
say hello to london for me. i miss her.
oh, yes.
you know, i saw you once there, in london. you are a great attraction.
mr. treves! treves.
john.... how can you ever forgive me?
it is all arranged. I will send over some evening gowns for the sisters that you select to accompany mr. merrick. you will be using the royal entrance and princess alexandra herself will be there to welcome him to her private box.
I am very grateful to you, mrs. kendal. this is just the thing to help him forget his ordeal. john will be very excited.
well it is a miracle he ever got back. and, I am sure, mr. treves, under your expert care, he will have many happy years ahead.
i fear not, mrs. kendal. even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
how awful for john.
and yet, not once have any of us heard him complain.
is he... dying then?
yes. there is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. and when that patient is a friend, no... no, there is absolutely nothing i can do.
well, it is all quite... I have never heard... it is quite...
yes.
fair katharine, and most fair, will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms such as will enter at a lady's ear and plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
your majesty shall mock at me; i cannot speak your england.
o fair katharine, if you will love me soundly with your french heart, i will be glad to hear you confess it brokenly with your english tongue. do you like me, kate?
pardonnez-moi, i cannot tell vat is "like me".
