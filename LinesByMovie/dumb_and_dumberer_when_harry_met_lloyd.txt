is it true what you said to captain rob?
yes, harry. i can not home school you anymore. so maybe it is time to make some new friends, some friends your own age...
I am just not ready.
wow, a treasure map! what is the treasure?
it could be anything. you are going to discover a whole new world when you get to school.
wow just like marco polo.
i do not follow.
you know mom, like in the pool.
you are going to be just fine, harry.
i know i am, mom.
here's your lunch. and an apple and banana for extra energy.
maybe the treasure's a chest full of apples and bananas!
mom, you know that never works.
right.
senior year. my little boy. who woulda thunk it?  you are a good kid, lloyd. i do not say it enough, but I am proud of you son.
thanks, pop.
you could have saved that for the tooth fairy!
that is stupid! i happen to know my mom is the tooth fairy.
your mom is the tooth fairy? that is so cool!
yeah, she must do all the flying around when I am asleep.  harry dunne.
no thanks, not hungry. harry dunne. why does that name not sound familiar?
probably because we have never met.
no, that is not it. anyway -  lloyd christmas.
here i am bragging my mom is the tooth fairy, and I am talking to santa's kid!
i have not seen you around here before.
home school. til today.
home school? what is that?
i go to school where i live.
me too!
i think it is just over there.
is that what i think it is?
no, it is a treasure map.
cool.
my mom says the treasure's somewhere in the school.
i do not know. I am pretty familiar with the school and I have never seen that "x". but... i do know something.
what?
you are it.
yeah, dangerous cult. do not make eye contact or they might talk to you.
do not we want them to talk to us?
no no no no no.
why not?
well, besides cooties and other medical reasons, they are not in the cool crowd. which i am, and you want to be. know what i mean?
no.
oh my gosh, i do not think she is even wearing underwear!
how nerdy is that? I am wearing two pairs right now.
me too!
hi.
well i hope the carpet matches the drapes.
excuse me.
in the new library there.
oh, yeah. i do not think they do. you are new here, right?
depends how you define 'new'...
you are the kid who was home schooled.
yeah. how did you know?
I have been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. it was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
four colors? neato!
yeah, well, I would much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. but, i chose you and that is fine.  I am jessica matthews.
harry dunne.
turk, leave him alone.
turk, leave him alone.  you are coming too.
hey, turk rescued you from the nerd. you are in!
I will talk to you later.
... and, principal collins, you will be pleased to know that this year wednesdays are "south of the border" days. we will serve a spicy tuna tamale along with a cheese quesadilla.
good. good. good. well, that is good.
god, I have missed you.
and i you.
you know honey, I have finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in waikiki.
how baby-cakes? you have done it all.
small potatoes. this one is big time. this is visionary. this idea is genius.
it is the big potato.
yes, it is the big potato. just have a look at this.
anyway, the state is giving a hundred thousand dollars in his name to every school that has a special needs class.
oh, this is fantastic. so all we have to do is kill this moffit guy and we get all the money!
no. no. that is not it. we do not kill him. we do not kill anybody. but i like the way you are thinking. you are focused and you are trying to follow. no, what we need to do is start a fake special needs class.
we start our own class?
maybe someday. aloha cold weather, aloha hot weather.
you said "aloha" twice.
aloha means hello and goodbye.
oh wow. look at you.
times two.
i think you will make a good teacher.
you know harry, this is my favorite time of day.
yeah, it is nice. and your friend turk is totally great.
yeah, he is aces.  thanks, turk!
god, she is beautiful. my wiener's all tingly.
shift to your left.
who is principal collins?
the principal.
wow.
your assignment is to pick the class. find some other students just as special as you.
will that be on the midterm?
no.
you know, you are the first person I have brought here.
oh, is this your special place?
no, i just usually eat my lunch on the crapper. saves time. out with the old, in with the new.
can we eat there tomorrow?
sure, but first we have to find kids special, needy and classy enough to be in special needs.
it will be like taking candy from a stranger.
h a r r y...
the second r is silent.
oh, of course.
hello, little orphan boy. what happened to you?
skateboard.
one day they will find a cure.
you brave soldier.
what? it is nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
of course it does.  obviously in denial.  maybe we can help.
we are part of a special class taught by the lunch lady, er, i mean ms. heller. maybe you would like to join us, it does not require any walking.
and nobody will make fun of your horrible deformity.
how much homework is there?
that is the downside. there is none.
wait a minute. i can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? can i bring my girlfriend?
you can bring whatever you want, little friend.
...oh also, we even have a slogan. 's' and 'p' stands for 'special people', which is the kind of kids we are. 'a' and 'z' is for 'aren't zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...
harry, what are you doing? she is a foreign exchange student. she does not speak the english.  ching chong ching chingy chingy chong chong.
wow! it is a half-boy, half-horse. the boys walk up to him, impressed.
now that is more of what we are looking for.
well i need to get a job and you are telling me that if i join up - i can really come and go whenever i want?
you were born free and free you should remain.
maybe we should ask jessica to join the class.
jessica? please hold for my reaction.
thanks for the grub, mrs. d. where is mr. d?
he passed away three years ago.
well he missed a great pot of stew!
it was meatloaf. you just put everything in your soup.
i liked it a lot.
oh, harry, I am so proud of you making a real friend.
is it okay if he spends the night?
lloyd, did you ask your parents?
then a sleep-over is okay by me. okay boys, eat up.
oh lloyd, you got to taste my mom's pie!
so boys, how was your first day?
got any crazy eights?
go fish.
oh, yeah. well i almost always beat captain rob.
who is captain rob?
just a guy i hang out with.
i know the type. lives in the basement, smells like a sponge...
no! captain rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
sounds like a pirate.
what? no no. he is got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
yeah, he is a pirate.
i do not think so. this guy drinks rum from a barrel, says "yo ho ho" has a peg leg...
peg leg?
yeah, go-cart accident.
exactly! a pirate!
if he heard you talking like that he would make you walk the plank.  three, two, one. now it is your turn, spin.
a-ha! you landed on candyland! now swallow it!
hey you two. lights out.
hey can be on top?
whoa. what was that?
what?
your mom made a move on me.
she did not.
who knows? maybe someday I will be your new daddy.
lloyd, she is my mom.
i can not help my heart. and when I am your dad, you will have to do as i say.
will not.
do not use that tone with me, young man.
shut up!
i will stop this car right now.
you are not my real dad.
you take that back!
shut up! buttlick!
where did you learn that word?
i learned it from listening to you! i hate you!
kids.
to take a picture for superintendent zimmer?
yes!
that would be me, sir. the wife made stew last night.
shut up lloyd. you are not married yet.
collins is a great man!
now you see why he was elected principal?
so far so good. we will need more pictures. why do not you take them on a field trip tomorrow.
and...?
and, take some more pictures.
wow, you are smart.
and you are great in bed.
harry.
you look familiar. did i have your brother?
no.
okay. anyone else have any questions?
what is with horse-boy, now he is a bright shiny sun?
do not look directly at him.
lloyd, may i see you a minute?
class, please study on your own. there seems to be a family emergency because there is no other reason why my father would interrupt me while I am working!
what are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed?
we are not crazy. we are "special". principal collins wants us to have our own classroom!
my boy's special, well how about that. i knew you were different.
so i guess you will need a new spot for your moonshine.
i reckon so.
but i came here to learn about america.
baby listen, there is nothing more american than not doing anything and getting away with it.
then I am in. just like jerk-off.
...and who was benjamin franklin again?
the pilgrim who used penicillin to kill godzilla.
i did not know that.
welcome to public school, my friend.
hey, teach, how did you get so smart?
when you live in the basement of the school, you breathe in a lot of chalk dust. it writes out all the answers on your brain.  now how about a slushee?
a. slushee. do not tell me.  abraham slushee. third president of the united states.
and he invented fire.
nice jugs.
they can not be real.
you are it.
oh, no. you are not gettin' me again.
you are it.
oh! ho! okay. you wanna go?
no, I am not it.
yeah, you are. he touched you. you are "it" until you touch someone else.
i have five kids at home, i know how it works. I am just not "it". okay guys? two fifty.
you are it.
guys. give me the two fifty and go away.
can he do that?
harry, he can and he did. and now it is on like donkey kong.
these are really cold, huh?
that is why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
owww... refreshing.
ow... what do you want to do, harry?
i do not know. owwww.
maybe i should go home and grade papers. owwww.
my head is suddenly killing me. maybe it is from all the learning today.
put some ice on it.
owww.
and my mouph is frozen.
hey guys.
heddo jeth-ica.
harry, i heard collins has you in some kind of special class.
if dou're trying to get in, dou're doo late.
oh no, i know that class is not for me. but I am happy for you guys.
do you thill want to do an arwticle on me, jethica?
yes, you and the whole special needs class.
why ith dat newth?
this school's never had one before. I would like to talk to you and all your special friends.
tomorrow we go on a fee-eee-eee- wald twrip.
a field trip? maybe I will join you. see you tomorrow.
there she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
what a nerd. i do not know where that girl's ever going to find a husband.
knock knock.
who is there?
guess what"s under these coconuts.
what?
it is a surprise.
well I have got a little surprise for you.
you got the extender?
no. no. i heard from superintendent zimmer this morning and evidently he is so impressed with our special needs class, he is bringing richard moffit himself to the thanksgiving day parade- check in hand.
monkey, this is too exciting! i can not believe our dream is coming true.
so what do you keep in there?
oh, things. photos. tapes. i tape everything that goes on in this office.
everything?
everything. just for the record.
oh, just like the president.
just like the president.
lloyd, where have you been? I have been waiting forever. I am so embarrassed.
sorry. why are you dressed like a queen!?
...cause you said...
harry, i said do not 'dress like a queen'!
oh... that makes much more sense. i had a heck of time getting these drapes from my mom. you do not want to know where i put the cord.
harry! here he comes.
yeah, we are closed. so go away.
actually we have something for you.
ms. heller, mind if i tag along on your field trip? I am thinking of doing a story on your special needs class.
I am not interested. not after the smear story you did on my chicken sushi.
well, when 200 students are hospitalized with stomach cramps i think it is newsworthy.
nevertheless, you could have mentioned the sauce.  well, i see you have a camera.
so can i come along?
no.
are you wearing a coconut bra?
oh, you are good.
why are you teaching special needs? you are the lunch lady.
dietician! this interview is over. you can have the camera back tomorrow. come by the classroom. heller heads off.
you mean the lunch room?
according to the map, we are just about at school.
yeah, but we still have not found any treasure.
what?
our own special bus.
how do you know it is for us?
duh. the cool kids sit in the back of the bus. here, every row is in the back. we are all cool!
nope. i was right.
wanna bet?
turk, what are you doing here?
special needs class.
being a jerk does not make you special.
you are just jealous.
and, ching chong, you are not a special needs kid. you are just a foreign exchange student.
i thought i told you to get lost.
look ms. heller, there is something fishy here, and i do not think it is friday's special.
i would not know. being that I am just the teacher and all.
let's go margie. the museum am not going to teach itself.
museum huh, have not been there since my husband left me. i love art.
looking for a scoop, huh? I will give you a scoop... of short bus.  lose her!
loser... oh yeah he was a loser alright. a big loser.
what?
he was a big loser! what are you deaf!?
uh, no and i do not appreciate...turn down here!
that is great, now make a left, then straight!
oh, yeah he was straight all right, just was not very good in the sack. i used to give him directions. higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. useless.
left here! left!
you bet i left him, took the dog and we was history.
ha! too big to make the turn!
no, it actually fit quite nicely.  well, except for the fact that it was not really as long as it was wide.
i think you did it.
damn right i did it. went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and i ended up doing ten years at rikers, got my teeth knocked out by mike the dyke.
what the hell are you talking about?
uh oh. captain rob's always been my partner.
sucks for you.
who is your partner?
i do not know. i have not decided yet.
well... uh...maybe... jeez, how can i say this... you and i could...perhaps ...maybe...uh... partner up?
you and me? dream on, desperado.
oh. sorry. you are right, field trip partner is a big commitment.
I am kidding! of course I will be your partner.
that is a cow, harry.
well, i could go for a tall glass of polar bear milk right now.
harry!
ms. heller said not to talk to you.
that is because ms. heller does not want you to know this whole thing is a scam.
a-ha! i had a feeling it was all a fake.
you did?
yeah. look at this polar bear. it has not moved in half an hour. and those eskimos over there...i'm sure at least one of them is a mannequin.
oh harry, you are so funny. now i have something that is kind of delicate...
oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
are you trying to be funny? or are you actually re--, re...special
we are all special. everyone lloyd and i chose for the class is special.
you and lloyd chose the class!?
excuse me?
come over around seven.
o'clock?
yeah...
gotcha.
sorry about that harry, first time I have brought a friend up there. you okay?
yea!
who cares? chicks are for fags.
i think she wants me to come over to put me into the right position to check out her delicates, what ever that means.
oh yeah, buddy, you are going to get "some".
some what?
you know... she is going to be all over you like a barrel of monkeys, with her tight shirt and short skirt... eeeww, it is so faggy i can not even talk about it.
come on, lloyd. you must know someone i can talk to.
sure i do. on one condition.
you can not marry my mom.
it is really not up to you, harry. but we just want you to feel like you are part of the decision.
shut up!
alright, if you really want to go down this road, well girl's like chocolate.
wipe your feet. my parents are totally anal.
ooh gross.
would you like something to drink?
yeah, but I am buying.
okay, there is a lot for us to go over, so it may get hard for you.
hard for me? hard for me? hard for me? hard for me?  you had questions?
i checked with the school board, she is not an accredited teacher.
that is okay. lloyd's really the one teaching the class.
lloyd? what about ms. heller?
she says that she is got more important things to do now that the new mall opened.
sit down, i have something to tell you.
I am fine.
well, I will tell you what i think. i think she and principal collins are embezzling money from the school, and i think they have been doing it for years.
what? well now I am in a position where i may just heed your help.
po, po, position...? hey, here's thought, have you a bathroom?
just down the hall.
very good. back in a jiff.
harry? are you okay?
are you kidding? i could not be more okay.
my mom wants to know if you can stay for dinner.
are you kidding? I will be down in a "i-crapped-my-pants."
what?
coming.
oh hey lloyd, why are you here?
just wanted to see how your doing.
i kinda screwed things up.
I am sure you are overreacting.
i do not think so.
you are always your harshest critic.
she wants me to stay for dinner, i do not know what to say to her.
okay, i saw this in a movie once. open the dining room window and follow my lead. say what i say.
good - thanks lloyd! I will meet you downstairs, i got to find some clothes.
what are you wearing?
i, uh... changed for dinner. i get dressed for all my meals. except breakfast and bath-meal.  boy, it is hot in here. mind if i open a window?
harry, can you hear me?
yes.
yes, what?
do not answer me. say what i say.
okay.
okay, what?
you have beautiful eyes.
you have beautiful eyes.
hey, where did you come from?
hey, where did you come from?
well i was born in st. louis.
do you want me to pet your head?
do you want me to pet your head?
i bet you want your head scratched.
i bet you want your head scratched.
do not snap at me like that. you are lucky i do not punch you right in the face.
do not snap at me like that. you are lucky i do not punch you right in the face.
now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
uh... not a great first impression... dinner's ready.
then what are we doing sitting around yapping? let's eat!
the name's walter.
well la de da.
what are you doing here?
checking up on my friend, harry.
oh harry's doing just fine, he is just about to open up.
we have got some margarine too if you would like to scoop it out of the tub.
no, I am fine thanks.
well save room for mrs. matthews famous baked brisket.
famous? I have never heard of it.
sure, i like a woman with some meat on her bones.
so, have you given him "some" yet?
what?
you know, "some". the fag stuff.
harry and i have been talking about school. in fact, i want to ask you something.
i know, you want go for a ride.
where did that come from? he holds up a giant key chain.
come on, i live with the janitor. i have a key to every room in the school.
so could you get us into the principal's office?
principal's office? yeah, i guess i can swing that.
so, when can we do it?
tomorrow night?
oh, baby, you are the bestest.
oh, go on.
mrs. d! i was hoping you would show up.
oh honey, i would not miss this for the world.
have you got what i want?
you know i do!
oh yeah, give it to me.
how was that?
it is too close to call.  okay next contest, now lets...
lloyd, what are you doing? that is jessica and... my mom.
harry, this is my fantasy! i suggest you leave - before i imagine something horrible.
but-
harry!
you are right. hey, thanks for the jet pack. your fantasies are so much cooler than mine. bye mom.
well, something stinks.
maybe it is this mix tape i made you. or maybe these flowers. he gives jessica the flowers and tape.
uh, thanks. god I am so excited! so, are you ready to take me to the principal's office? he whips out the key, she takes it.
so no small talk? good, 'cause i do not know how to make that. yep. small talk. not for me. not a fan.  got any hobbies? how 'bout this weather?
what are you doing?
let's just do it and get out of here.
I am so close i can feel it.
me too. I am almost there.
that is it. I am done.
that was fast. well, did you at least enjoy it?
no, it was a complete waste of time.
this is so embarrassing, it is never happened before. well, maybe a couple of times, but i was alone.
that is my boyfriend.
boyfriend? what about all that talk about riding my waxer?
thanks, lloyd. but i did not find what i was looking for. oh can you do me a favor and clean up? collins can not know we were here.
harry! i found the treasure!
go away, assface.
did you hear what i said? the treasure! like on your map!
yeah, right. why do not you show it to your "girlfriend"?
jessica and i are through. i could not stand being with her knowing you liked her. it was not worth our friendship. oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
do you hear something, captain rob?
captain rob came back?
yeah, he does sound like a rat fink.
hey, there is no reason to use that kind of language!
good one, captain rob. he does look like a you-know-what.
oh, telling inside jokes now, are we? that is it. you are out of the cool crowd. next time turk's passing out wedgies, you am not gettin' one.
harry, would you like to share with the rest of us what is so funny?
you would not get it. just a private joke between best friends.
no one knows?
me, me, me!
the answer is george jefferson.
do i know you?
duh. I am in your class at school.
oh my god, it is really you. you are harry's friend, right?
i do not know if you would call us "friends"...
you really are a pirate.
can you believe it?
so I am an "arrrrrs-hole", eh captain rob?
what are you talking about?
by the way, did captain rob mention how i beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
no. what happened?
nothing. why, whaddya hear?
baby, I am going to spend the morning at the mall. you know, shop for waikiki. honey, what are you looking for?
the chest! the chest that i put my papers in.
what papers?
the documents. the photos! the tapes! the evidence.
the evidence of what?
sweetheart keep up with me for half a minute. the evidence of every scam we ever pulled. the evidence that is going to put us away for twenty years.
where is it?
i do not know where it is. it is not here. it is been stolen.
wait a minute, i think i know who stole it.
no you do not know who stole it. just let me do the thinking.
it was jessica. that girl who tried to follow me on the field trip.
jessica. are you sure?
she is been snooping around a lot, asking questions.
okay, I will take care of jessica.
are you going to kill her?
why do not you see to it the kids are ready for the parade tomorrow. i have to pay somebody a little visit.
a raft.
a blimp.
a turd.
sorry, ms. heller. i think they are used to me teaching.
people! come on. "parade" float.
ting tao kuun jahn leeka leeka powww.
she is saying... a beautiful swan...
sleeeeew sheek baw...
... flying gracefully... over the rice fields.
kan maaaaw roy orbison kin nah mah oh che.
... to the tune of "only the lonely" by roy orbison.
george washington!
who?
hello, he only invented money!
that is not bad. how about a float of george washington crossing the delaware?
or maybe crossing a river!
you had some questions.
last year toby was in a.p. english. and lewis won the science fair. what are they doing in special needs?
poor question. too wordy. a good question gets right to the point. example, where is my chest?
i do not know what you are talking about.
oh i think you do.
my parents are going to wonder where i am.
one phone call from the principal will take care of that, my dear.
wow, we built a whole float in one afternoon. and now the reward.
what do you mean? we can not go in there or we will be "it".
if you have to ask, you do not know.
yeah, that is why i asked.
you certainly did.
i know i did.
sorry, no further questions.
sure.
go in there and get us two slushees.
okay.
do we have a deal?
yeah, deal. give me the two dollars.
ha! i said "doll-hairs." psych! but a deal's a deal, my friend. in you go.
fine. give me the doll hairs.
uh-oh. harry?
you are it.
am not.
are, too.
d2.
it is okay. i want the rush.
no. look.
hey, it is jessica.
that must be her boyfriend's car.
principal collins is her boyfriend!
now it makes total sense why she did not want him to know we were in his office the other night.
no wonder we both struck out with her. who can compete with the sexual power of the man who occupies the highest office in the land?
he is like the pope. like we are going to snake a girl away from the pope.
hey, let's go spy on them.
oh my god, are you alright?
yeah, i think.
so what did you say to my parents on the phone?
not to expect you tonight.
cute puppy.
he must be on his way to pee out a fire.
hey, look. ice cream.
you thinking what I am thinking?
I am going to ask you one last time and if i do not get an answer, i do not even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. where is my chest, jessica?
i do not know what you are talking about.
well, what have we here? it appears be a tape.
that is not your tape.
then where did you get this not my tape.
that is not your tape.
do not play with me dear, you are way out of your league.
harry! lloyd! you guys are a mess.
looks like the best man won.
why did not you tell us your boyfriend was principal collins?
what? no! look.
... if i may quote the twentieth century poet  - joe piscahpo:  you look marvelous...
lloyd, when we were in principal collins's office, did you see any kind of chest?
harry's treasure chest? sure. i know where that is.
you found my treasure? why did not you tell me.
three words. i did. but you were all mad at me and would not listen.
well, I am listening now.
me, too. this is my favorite part of the tape.
hey look, it is our teacher.
of course, she is in on it too. do not let her see you. just go get that chest and show the world what collins has been doing. I am staying here.
obviously.
so miss snoopy reporter girl, it appears that you have snooped yourself into a corner and snoopcuffed yourself to a desk. whose wearing the coconut bra now?
do not worry about me, I will be fine. i can take care of myself and I am getting the story every high school reporter dreams of.
"my dream date with principal collins."
you know lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.
how true. but i still feel i deserve more than you do of this treasure. i mean, i found it.
but my mom gave me the map.
i lugged it all over town!
i made the polar bear pants.
but i ate your mom's pie.
i... found that rock.
it was a diamond and you swallowed it.
enough! look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
i do not know who we are anymore.
i have no idea - it is full of files and documents and tapes.
do you know what this means?
hey lloyd. this looks like another one of your mix tapes.
maybe the pirate who buried this treasure chest made it. put it on.
that makes total sense. the treasure chest was in his office. which means principal collins is a pirate! I am surprised captain rob never mentioned him.
that is because captain rob is not a pirate. we have been through this.
what was it jessica wanted us to do with this chest again?
something about showing the world what principal collins has done.
right. she is so proud of her boyfriend.
what? what did we do?
we never thanked him for giving us our special needs class.
that is what jessica was talking about!
she wants us to show the world what a great guy principal collins is.
and like she said, do it before the parade.
a float!
that is it. build him a float for the thanksgiving day parade!
harry, we found the real thing to be thankful for. screw george washington!
yes. screw george washington. just like marilyn monroe did.
ready lloyd?
put a fork in me harry, lets get started.
wait, wait!
harry, are we gonna build this thing or not?
lloyd, what I am saying is we may already have what we want.
so the chest is still out there somewhere.
yes. so as soon as zimmer shows up, we will get our check and blow this pop stand before anyone finds out anything.
this band sounds terrible.
i sold all the wind instruments.  hawaiian air, business class. and you like that new fur coat?
love it!
well there is a reason why that mascot is not a stallion anymore.
this is horse?
no... no it is not horse, you see i sold the horse.
guys, this is much better.
principal collins is a greater american than george washington will ever be.
i do not get it. why did you make him a pirate?
I will tell you why!
oh my god. can you believe your ears?
yeah! no more clicks and whistles! now she speaks perfect english!
you are a great teacher, lloyd.
ching chong, what happened to your beautiful asian accent?
actually, my name is cindy, the accent just helps me meet boys.
I am not sure if i can do this.
sure you can. we got to nail this guy. you will be fine.
collins can be a pretty crafty guy, what do i do if he smells the trap.
i do not think he will smell anything - just make sure he takes the check. I have been through this a hundred times.
well you know detective, he is expecting  'moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
yeah, i get it. do not worry i studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you will be fine.
i am strong!
yes you are.
i can turn on all the faucets in my house.  even the hose.
but we do not drink from the house do we.
start the tape, lloyd.
roger that, wilco.
oh, good. there is jessica.
how could she miss this? this whole salute to collins was her idea.
hey there goes principal collins!
he is so modest. probably embarrassed by all the attention.
well, that is too bad, this is his day.
he is going to be in jail for a long time.
principal of jail. wow. what a promotion.
oh my god! she is two-timing principal collins!
and with that complete loser
ya know harry, i think this whole experience has soured me on women.
yeah, we should never let a woman come between us again.
i do not think that will happen. we have learned a valuable lesson we will not ever forget.
hold up. first, we have to decide who gets who, remember? no more competition?
right.
okay. which one do you want?
the one on the left.
damn! what are the odds?
what?
that is the one i wanted.
she is one of a kind.
try one in a million!
well, what should we do?
you take her.
no lloyd. chicks are for fags - I am not going to do it.
sorry, charlie.
hey, where did you go?
beats me. it is jessica's dad - she said he is really anal.
that is gross.
i know.
