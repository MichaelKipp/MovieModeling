mama, my story.
again?
tell me.
your father had been very ill, we thought he would die, and some animals had died.
cow.
you were a beautiful baby. so calm.
no cried?
and that day, your father got better. he named you lhamo. "the protector."
i know.
oh, no. where will he go?
far, far away.
good day.
good day.
please, come in, so cold.
we are traveling to lhasa. may we...?
of course, please, this way. your servant may use the kitchen.
thank you.
your father had been very sick.
he had been sick from the time you began growing in me. we thought he would die.
cow.
yes. a cow had died. one night, you stopped all your moving, and i said to your sister, "his time has come."
me. first break of day.
at dawn, you were born. one eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. we gave you the sweet drink.
i pooped.
you did. we washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. that day the father got better. and that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. i just remembered.
i miss my brother.
i miss him too.
i will be back in a few days.
how many?
two.
this many?
yes, yes. your brothers are here.
who am i?
we do not know.
i'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men.
and after the game, we're going to trade. you just stay over there, no, there!, norbu, and i will shoot at you. i want your land. i take it. i am stronger.
i am braver.
i have more men.
i have smarter men.
things change, kundun.
why is your beard so funny? let me touch this.
she carried a basket in her arms, a big, heavy basket, and the old monk cautiously approached. she opened her basket and showed what she had. heads. human heads. only the heads.
is that true or pretend?
it is a story, you decide.
pretend.
as you say.
i want to go down there.
you can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
i want to run down the street. i want to buy a toy. eat from the shops.
you cannot.
i want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
but you are not a shepherd, you are the dalai lama.
maybe in the next life, the world will not need a dalai lama.
i would not know. maybe.
i am sorry, lhamo.
it is alright, father.
not the way to talk to people.
can i do anything i want?
no.
but, i am in charge.
are you? of whom?
can i save the sheep from going to the market? so they don't die.
you could buy them.
do i have money?
what do you think?
do you have money?
i do, now.
and you have horses? you love horses.
i do, beautiful horses. thank you, holiness.
will you buy the sheep for me?
where will you keep them?
here. we'll collect them.
i will buy them for you.
can i free the prisoners?
hmmm.
you can't do anything real until you are dalai lama.
i am him.
not until you are eighteen.
i have news. the regent has resigned his post.
is he a bad man? norbu says he is "lavish" and "willful". "how can he give you monk's vows if he has not kept them himself?"
well, some say. it's not for you to worry about. another will be chosen.
he was always nice to me. he found me. he saw me in his dreams.
i turn you over again, today, lhamo. one day, you will not be able to come running to us.
but you will always be here?
me?
you will always!
i have one more piece of news. a baby is coming.
the four noble truths, as taught by the lord sakyamuni buddha are: the truth of suffering the truth of the cause of suffering, the truth of the cessation of suffering, the truth of the way which leads to the cessation of suffering.
i accept it. what is suffering?
true suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death -- these are surferings.
i accept it. what are the causes of suffering?
the causes of suffering arise from true sources. attachment, desire, envy, hatred, greed, unkindness, wrong view and so forth -- these are some causes of suffering.
i need to squeeze this brain.
answer.
may i listen to the news with you, holiness?
please.
how big is tibet's army?
roughly five thousand men.
is that big?
no. not very big.
the regent is adding men. and he bought rifles and ammunition from india. mountain guns, too.
will we be in this war?
no. this war is almost over.
will we ever be in war?
we have enemies.
the chinese.
yes.
but, surely, we are safe in tibet. we don't believe in killing.
this is britain.
ahh.
where is poland?
in the pacific ocean.
it is an island. american territory.
where is alsace?
i do not know, holiness.
this is tibet. and this is china.
ahh.
what was the warning of the thirteenth dalai lama?
he warned about the future of tibet.
tell me.
when it is time.
why is this? what is happening? tell me!
reting rinpoche has been arrested. he tried to overthrow regent taktra. today, he is brought back to lhasa by government officials. the monks at sera monastery have been on his side. now, there is trouble between them and the army.
i am sorry for you to have to witness this, kundun.
look here!
what can i do? i am only a boy.
you are the man who wrote this letter. you are the man who has come back to lead us. you will soon have great responsibilities. you must know what to do.
taktra rinpoche, i understand there was an attempt on your life.
it is possible, holiness.
you are unharmed?
completely.
good. where is reting rinpoche now?
he has been imprisoned, here in the potala, holiness.
the sera monks have surrendered?
it is calm.
i need to know what you know. i am no longer a child.
ask whatever you will.
what is the danger from the chinese, now?
very complicated, holiness. let me tell you current news. the chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that tibet belongs to china. we sent a mission to the chinese national conference. our attendance was a grave mistake.
the tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "chinese region of tibet". we protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
did you receive the letter?
we did not.
the war is over. this is a time in when nations are redefining themselves.
so, tibet, too, needs to define itself.
yes. as a free country. but our attempts have proven futile. we continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the chinese.
can india help us?
india is a newly independent nation. they are struggling. india is in no position to help us.
britain?
britain chooses not to.
and, america?
america, we shall see.
ask the chinese mission to leave our country. immediately.
quite simple. yes. good.
i shall send a letter to america, to the president, informing him of our problem.
if we agree that we are part of china, nothing else will matter. not trade, not defense. we will be lost.
what would you do, holiness?
what should i do about my doubt, teacher?
it is a difficult situation.
i mean, my doubt. why me? am i him?
doubt is an affliction. reliquish it. accept.
what is the size of our army, now?
eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. we have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from india. we have several hundred in the area.
has anyone died?
the radio contact said one officer had died. then he said, "the chinese soldiers -- they are coming." and then, the radio went dead.
the people want you made dalai lama.
then, i am lucky. i am still too young.
these are dangerous times. they want the dalai lama to lead them.
but, i have no experience.
oh, but you do, kundun. who else would be here?
tell me.
they think they have convinced me. they think i am on their side. they have allowed me to leave kumbum and come to lhasa believing that i will try to turn you to their ways. if i do not succeed, i am to eliminate you.
you, kill me?
eliminate you.
don't eat all those sweets. you'll get sick.
do you remember the day i came to your monastery, when i was a baby? and you comforted me?
i do.
i remember, too, actually. i was frightened then. i am frightened now.
the chinese have one goal. the complete dissolution of our nation. the destruction of our culture. there is no room for buddha in their world. our only hope is to fight.
we cannot.
this is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. this is a fight for tibet.
buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. we have compassion for all people.
these are not human beings. they are worse than ghosts.
you are in great danger. the dalai lama cannot fall into chinese hands. you must flee.
how could i ever leave?
it may not be your decision to make.
you will not come?
no, holiness.
am i running away?
the people will cry when they learn you are gone. but they would all want you safe.
you must study very hard, do not neglect the holy things during this time.
i will miss you.
we have had fun, you and i. fun for a little boy in an old palace.
we have.
you have grown up very good.
and you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
we must go, holiness.
a moment.
please, come, holiness.
yes. i am ready.
all quiet?
yes, holiness.
where are you from?
kham, holiness.
your people are very brave. they are fighting the chinese. no one can stop them. not even me.
khambas are wild men.
i worry about them.
do not worry, holiness. they fight for you. they are under your protection.
did you love your husband, before you married?
i did not know him before i married him. i loved his brother, but then, i married his brother, too. he is dead now.
hmm.
the land has stayed in the family. we work together. the nobleman is not too bad.
does he treat you fairly?
no.
too young?
much too young.
look for a strong woman, not too occupied with her beauty. look for a woman who keeps her hands busy. look for a kind heart.
like my mother.
i see that.
this little brother was terribly sweet. when he died, my mother was so sad. a lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. he will come back to you, you will see. so, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.
does he have the spot?
he does, a little spot where the butter had been.
is that a true story, or pretend?
what do you think?
true.
you decide.
what does the butter spot feel like?
soft. nice. i have a good friend back in lhasa.
of the tibetan delegations sent abroad, all have been turned away.
all?
and the united nations? surely?
the united nations voted not to hear our appeal.
one country did sponsor the resolution. a land called "el salvador".
where is that?
in the americas.
so, we must face china and all her might alone.
yes. most of the chamdo region is now in chinese hands. there is a report from chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, communist troops will soon be marching on lhasa.
with much bloodshed.
i am afraid.
i want at all costs to avoid this. do we have news from the delegation in china?
not yet, but the governor of chamdo, ngabo jigme, suggests we must negotiate and offers to go to peking.
he is a capable man.
your prime minsters would argue that such negotiations should take place in lhasa.
and then they would concede that the times are desperate and we must go to peking. agreed. send ngabo. is that all?
yes.
time to study.
ngabo did not have the state seal. he could not sign.
yes, but they say he did.
holiness?
yes.
general chiang chin-wu, the chinese representative, is en route to dromo. he is coming to meet you.
then, we shall meet.
dalai lama.
general chiang.
we bring greetings from chairman mao.
thank you. please sit.
have you heard the terms of the seventeen point agreement?
i have.
i have a copy for you.
do you have plans to return soon, dalai lama?
soon.
good. our first request is that you allow us to build a road. you have no roads in tibet. we can discuss the plans in lhasa. when you return.
your prime ministers, support the proposal that you return to lhasa. on the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. they believe you should leave now, for india.
if i were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from india, suppose?
it is unlikely. america, perhaps. there is great anti-communist feeling in america.
at this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
the chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
tibet, at war? no. china is close, america is far away. after countless people die, china would still, always, be close. we will work with what we have.
i am scared.
shall we consult the protective deities, holiness?
my first and foremost duty is to protect my people. i feel sure of this. and, things change. maybe not right away, maybe not soon. but i believe this -- things will change.
goodbye, kundun.
no!
you must also do something about the public meetings. i see this, memorandum circulating, with tibetan grievances.
you have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. it is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
we are simply respecting the terms of the seventeen point agreement.
are you, general?
we want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
impossible! you will bring famine down on the people of tibet with these insatiable demands! more food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
the people's liberation army pays for all food and lodging.
so far, they do. but, the quantity, it does not exist. you will have to re-evaluate your needs.
how much tea do you drink, prime minister?
it depends on the quality. and, that it be indian.
why is it necessary for the chinese to keep so many soldiers in lhasa?
to protect. to serve you. chairman mao wants you to feel that china belongs to you now.
chairman mao can keep china. just give us back tibet.
plans for absorbing the tibetan army into the people's army will soon be finalized.
i will not approve it.
then, we will begin with replacing the tibetan flag with the flag of the motherland.
and we will begin with tearing it down.
you must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the tibetans trust and good nature.
i have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
it is too early to implement all the clauses of the seventeen point agreement. we will establish a preparatory committee for the autonomous region of tibet. the pace of reform must meet with the desires of the tibetan people. changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary.
i am happy to hear you say this, chairman mao. i have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished inherited tax, and forgiven all money owed the government by people who are unable to pay.
good. very good. tibet is a great country. a wonderful history. long ago, you even conquered part of china. but now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. in twenty years time you could be ahead of us. then it will be your turn to help china.
you know, i have great respect for your lord buddha. he was anti-caste. anti-corruption. anti-exploitation. for some, politics and religion can mix.
for me, i think such a mix is crucial.
have a sweet. made in my home province. the kind my mother used to make.
ah, dalai lama, thank you for coming so late.
i leave tomorrow.
yes, i am aware. how has your time in china been?
i have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. industrial progress. great efficiency. your people are capable and courteous.
you have a lot to learn about organization. how to draw out people's opinions. how to make key decisions. train your young tibetans. when i make contact with you, i want to reach you through a tibetan.
always.
did you ever doubt it?
i had relinquished doubt.
i ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.
the khamba's gun is his most prized possession. i admire them so. they face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.
land reform is underway in amdo. the large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. landlords are being punished.
a beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the chinese.
i have always asked for plain information. just the truth.
the communists put their guns in the hands of the khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. they have dropped bombs on the monastery of lithang in kham. it has been destroyed. women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
the pursuit of non-violence. very difficult.
non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. resistance, when it is not.
they will take lhasa next.
the people will not allow it.
the crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the chinese festivities. many who have been invited to dine with the chinese do not return home.
i will not go.
i will alert the chinese delegation. you know, i would never have let you go alone, kundun.
do you think i must?
you decide.
we are now accused of aiding the rebels. the chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
