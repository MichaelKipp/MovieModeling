do you have any music?
what?
music. i think it helps if you play something he liked.
john, play the sinatra.
no we can't. he is got a pulse.
no shit.
is he going to be alright?
his heart's beating.
excuse me. you are a very kind man. i can see that. a man like you could not refuse a poor sick dying helpless man a small cup of water.
i can't. i have to stay with my patient.
he got better.
i hate pronouncing people dead over the phone.  better, huh? they are fixed and dilated. he is plant food.
he one of them?
no, that is noel. used to be a regular off and on, has not been in in a while. he seized and almost coded--i gave him a hypertonic solution. he drank so much the kidneys were taking out salt. one for the textbooks.
he is very very sick.
i know him. that is noel.
we would better go outside. quickly.
is there any chance?
i guess there is always a chance.
i would not do that.  the doctor seems to think he is suffering from some rare disorder.
it is not so rare. he grew up on our street. he is had a rough life and he is a little crazy from it, but that is no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water.
the chinese close in five minutes. beef lo mein. it is  been on my mind since i woke. whatjathink?
i think the moment that food hits your mouth we will get a job.
turn here. you missed it. the chink is on 3rd.
oh no!--i just remembered.
what?
I am so stupid. i had beef lo mein last night. i can not eat the same thing two nights in a row. it is almost two o'clock, what the hell am i going to do? what you getting?
I am not hungry.
oh yeah, you do not eat food.
i eat. i just have not had coffee yet.
coffee and whiskey, lucky you am not dead with that diet. wait, I have got it. half fried chicken with fries. let's go, hurry up. come on.
turn it off.
what?
you know what. the radio.
you wanted it turned off. there is no such thing as a good fire. people get burned up. they can not breathe.
that is what we are here for. come on, frank.
do not push it, larry.
you are burned out.
one-three zebra. zebra three, i need you.
you see, he is giving it to us anyway.
zebra, are you there? I am holding an unconscious at first and st. marks.
no! it is three o'clock. that can only mean one thing.
mr. oh.
it is mr. oh. I am not answering it.
answer the radio zebra. you know it is that time.
four times this week I have had him. are not there any other units out there?  do not answer the radio. they will give it to someone else.
thirteen zebra. one-three zebra. you are going out of service in two seconds.
look, frank, when i say do not answer it, that means answer it.  you can do that for me at least.  three zebra.
yes, zebra. you will be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. the duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, mr. oh.
ten-four.  do not go. not this time.
relax, it is a street job, easy except for the smell. we will just throw him in back and zip over to mercy--no blood, no dying, that is how i look at it. he is just a drunk.
it is not our job to taxi drunks around.
they will just keep calling.
someone is going to die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of mr. oh.
well why did not you say so?
he is drunk.
faster! god!
faster!
it is my first cigarette in over a year.
the first is always the best.
it is the waiting that is killing me, not knowing, you know? it is really hard on my mother. the doctor does not think my father'll make it. he says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
you never know.
i mean if he was dead, i could handle that.
at least he is got people around him.
I am not so sure. my father and i have not spoken in three years. when my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he would locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over i was thinking how i was going to tell him what a bastard he was. then when i got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, i thought of all these other things i wanted to say.
even when you say the things, there is always more things.
right now, I am more worried about my mother than anything. they will not let her see my father.
go home. take her home. get some rest. not going to find anything out now.
that is what i told her. if she could just see him a second, then i could take her home.
larry, swing over on eighth. we are going to hafta run one of these calls.
relax, will you.
I am not feeling very well, larry. i say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
you have no sick time, frank. no time of any kind. everyone knows that.
take me back, put me to bed; i surrender. we have done enough damage tonight.
you take things too seriously. look at us, we are cruising around, talking, taking some quiet time, getting paid for it. we have got a good job here.
yeah, you are right.
tell me, you ever think of doing anything else?
sure, I am taking the captain's exam next year. after the kids are in school, louise can go back to the post office and, i thought, what the hell, I will start my own medic service. out on the island the volunteers are becoming salaried municipal. it is just a matter of time and who you know. someday it is going to be chief larry calling the shots.
he is crazy.
you really think so?
see, i can not do it. i came out of the desert.
you came out of the hospital. you were tied down and hallucinating. you got some bad chemicals in your head, noel. there is some medicine at the hospital that will fix that.
no, no medicine!
noel, you did not let me finish. we have rules against killing people on the street. looks bad, but there is a special room at the hospital for terminating. a nice quiet room with a big bed.
oh man, do you mean that?  thank you man, thank you. how?
well, you have your choice: pills, injection, gas.
jesus, tom walls, that crazy motherfucker.
used to be my partner.
it is not worth it, tom. he is surrendering.
no prisoners. do not worry, frank, just a little psychological first aid.
you are not going to die.
what did you say?
shut up. you are going to die and he is not. got it.
you should not smoke.
it is okay. they are prescription.  works better with a little whiskey.
that is my brother's problem. he is passed out inside.
that boy you brought in, he was shot, was not he?
yes.
he is dead, huh?
yes.
i think this place stinks.
our lady of misery.
did you see my father?
no.
it is crazy in there. what is wrong with that doctor? he keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
he is working a double shift.
thing is, I am supposed to be the fuckup. the one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. with my parents crying out here. i got a lot of guilt, you know what i mean?
my father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. it is like she is in a trance.
she should go home.
I would take her, but then who would stay here?
what am i going to to do with this guy?  pierce, i was just on the phone with borough command. out of twelve shifts this month, you have been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
I am sick. that is what I have been telling you.
you are killing me, you know that? you got no sick time according to command. I have been told to terminate.
it is okay. I will just get my things out of the locker.
I have never fired anyone in my life.
I am sorry captain. do not take it too hard.
nobody tells me to fire anyone. i told them: shove it up the big one.  sorry.  i said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
you know they will not do it. it is up to you. you got to be strong.
i feel for you, but we got an emergency here. it is a weekend of full moons.  everyone's called in sick. larry, veeber, stanley too. we need bodies out there. i had to put marcus on twelve young. you know he is not supposed to work two nights in a row.
you swore you would fire me if i came in late again.
I will fire you tomorrow. hell, better than that, I will forward you some sick time. a week, two weeks off-- how about that?
i do not think a week's going to do it.
I am sorry, pierce.  you are going out with marcus. duty calls. the city needs you.
my lord mother man, you look like hell. what were you drinking?
the captain almost fired me tonight. I am on my way out. anytime now.
nobody gets fired. look at me. only thing they might do is transfer you to the bronx. you look like you aged ten years since i rode with you last.
the ghosts--
you ever notice people who see shit always, are crazy?
i think the worst is over.
it can always get worse. you can not change what is out there, only where you are coming from. you got to let the lord take over, in here.
she only works when I am on. i make her wait and it drives her crazy.
is it true that you and love went on a blind date?  she hit you with a bottle?
she loves me the way no woman ever has.
twelve young, i do not have time for your games. now answer me or do i have to come out there myself?
i usually do not do calls before coffee. but i think it might do you some good.  twelve young is here and I am going to take care of you, baby. do not you worry about a thing, yahear, cause marcus is alive and on arrival.
I am not your baby, young, I am not your mother either. you are going to a cardiac arrest, avenue c and ninth, northeast corner. it is a club. take the side entrance.
ten-four, hon.  this is for you.
okay, what happened?
he is going to be all right, right?
no. he is dead.
no way, man.
he is dead and there is nothing we can do. come on, frank, that is it.
he is not dead. it is a heroin overdose. break out the narcon.
he is dead unless you folks want to stop bullshitting me and tell it straight. then, lord willing, we will try to bring him back.
all right, all right, he is been snorting that red death stuff. been going for four days.
what is his name?
ib bangin.
what did you mean ib bangin? what kind of name is ib bangin?
that guy i brought in yesterday, post-cardiac arrest. he is gone.
burke. you will not believe it. he is showing cognitive signs. he started with spontaneous respiration, now he is fighting to pull out the tube. had to sedate him. he is in a cat scan. I am giving him every test i can: thromboytics, steroids, nitrodrips, heparin.
what do you think?
who knows? it is all lower-brain-stem- activity. the heart refuses to stabilize--he's coded eleven times since he got here. this guy's a fighter. every time the valium wears off he starts yanking those restraints.
the family know?
i wanted to bring them in, to see if he would respond to voices, but they were not in the waiting room. the guy's daughter was in my face all last night and when i finally have something positive to tell her, she is gone.
i ever tell you about the time years ago i was on this ledge uptown, trying to talk this psycho inside?
where the guy jumped and you almost fell. no, you never told me that story.
no, you never listened. i was going, man, if someone on high had not pulled me in. i had put all i had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
make a left here. i want to stop.
yes?
hello, I am frank pierce, from the ambulance last night. i brought your father into the hospital and i just learned some news.
I will be right down.
he is better, is not he?
well, the doctor says he is showing some movement. it is still early, it might mean nothing, but i thought you would want to know.
i knew. i sensed it when i heard your voice.
you look so different.
i know. it is awful, is not it? night of the living cheerleaders.
i think it looks good.
i was going nuts in that waiting room so i came back to check on my mom.
how is she?
sleeping.
i was just going to get some food. pizza. maybe we could.
you can not kill my father that easy. he will fight forever. like with me: has not talked to me in three years. but it is okay. sometimes you have to put things behind you.
be tough to get a taxi here. we can give you a ride if you like.
okay.
who is that?
she is the daughter of a cardiac arrest i brought in last night. i told her we would give her a ride back to misery. her father's showing signs of improving.
oh, frank, you have got it bad, so much worse than i thought.
I am hungry too. we got to get some food after this.
god help us, he is hungry too.
he wants to pull that tube out. it is pretty painful--that's why they keep him sedated--but it is a good sign.
you sure? i know my father would hate to be tied down. he would not even go to the dentist.
that is how it is done. you have to keep the body going until the brain and heart recover enough to go on their own.
he is better, though, right?
he is better.
look, I am sorry, but it is important to me. i mean, a week ago i was wishing he was dead. and now i want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what i mean?
went over to sal's got this. there must be some place in hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. i call you if anything comes up.
thanks.
my father was a great man, you know. there was nobody he would not help. you know that crazy guy noel who i gave water to last night? he lived in our house for almost a year. a total stranger he would do anything for, his own family though ...
it is best not to ...  it is good pizza, huh?
not as good as nino's.
you remember that pizza place, joe's on tenth street maybe fifteen years ago?  when you ordered a pie it came with a little plastic madonna in the middle?
yeah, or saint anthony. you from the neighborhood?
i grew up on elizabeth. i went to blessed sacrament.
on yeah? i went to holy name. where did you go to high school?
we moved out after that. upstate.
like everybody else--except us. always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. your parents ... ?
they are fine. my old man was a bus driver, mom a nurse--i was sort of born to it, i guess.
you married?
ah, no. i was.  it is hard to explain. she had a hard time adjusting to, well, maybe it was my fault too.
it is been bad lately, but it is always bad.
how long you been doing this?
five years.
wow, you musta seen some things, huh? what is the worst thing you ever seen?
you learn to sort of block it out, you know, like cops fence off a crime scene. but then something good will happen and everything will just glow.
you must get a lot of overdoses. i bet you picked me up a couple of times.
i think I would remember that.
maybe not. i was a different person then. does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
mostly. it must be my face. my mother always said i looked like a priest.
i better go check on my father. thanks for the pizza. i owe you one. maybe when he gets better, you know, when we are done with all this.
sure.
rule number one: do not get involved with patients. rule number two: do not get involved with patient's daughters. you understand?
what about rule number three: do not get involved with dispatchers named love.
you do not know the first thing about rule number three, cannot begin to understand the complexities of that rule. come on, let's go look at some hookers. the kit kat will be letting out.  do not ever call a junkie whore a crackhead. they get real mad.
nice though, pulling back her hood as we drive by. there is a mystery to it, then she shows you.
she is no whore, marcus.
we are all whores, frank. you know what I am talking about, the way she looked at me.
she was not looking at you, man, she was looking at me.
no, you didn't, frank, thank you. but there is still a couple hours left on the shift.
i need a drink, that is all.
twelve young, answer the radio. i have a call for you.
she said to me, i love the way you talk on the radio.
i can not wait all night, young. I am holding a priority and if you do not answer I am going to knock you out of service.
do not worry, hon. young is here and he is going to help out--just remember, you owe me.
you are going to three-four avenue c, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
ten-four, hon.
look at that. a fat junkie. that is a first.
what is wrong.
no english. she has terrible pain in her belly.
pregnant.
no, no, that is impossible.
are you pregnant? estas embarazada?
can you walk? puedes caminar?
she say she in great pain.
thanks for the translation.  what is your name? nombre?
you know each other a long time?
two years. ever since we left island.
in that time, you ever have sex?
never. no cigarettes, no drugs, no booze.
no underwear?
we are virgins.
it is coming.  hold her down.
what is that, frank?
three legs.
that is too many.
backup?
it is coming.
is she dying?
she is having a baby. twins.
es impossible.
you can trust me on this one.
it is a miracle.
oh jesus, put her on the monitor. where is the pediatric code cart?  odette give me that tube. all right, flatline--let's do cpr. step back, frank. how many months?
can not tell. it was a breech, twins. the other one seems okay, though. marcus is taking him and the mother to maternity.
do not give me that look.
what look?
you know what I am talking about. it is all over your face. that i-just- saved-a-little-baby-boy look.
we just saved a little baby boy. think of it that way.
i do not want to hear about it, okay? that is three jobs for the night. it is over. three jobs and time for a drink. six am, the cocktail hour. pass the bottle; i know you are holding.
i hate vodka.
please, a little decorum if you will. what i was going to say is, is that holding that baby in my arms, i felt like i was twenty-one again. a call like that makes me think of going back to three nights a week, not two, start running again, cut down on the drinking.
I will drink to that.
here's to the greatest job in the world.
greatest job in the world.
let's do it!  it is marcus, love, only for you.
male diff breather, approximately 30, houston and a.
ten-four.
where you going?
i quit! I am through!
you can not leave me now.
excuse me. you seemed like you were in trouble.
I am all right. i just can not stand to see people tied up.  I am in the waiting room for hours, listening to noel screaming. the only reason he is screaming is 'cause he is tied up.
do not seem so bad to me.
do not say that. i wanted to cut my father loose too. they told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he is better and i go in. it is killing me seeing him fighting like that.  look, since you are here, maybe you could do me a favor. i need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? i have to visit a friend who is sick.
okay.
I am only asking because it is a dangerous building. there is been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. this woman I am seeing, she will want to talk to me all day, but if i can point to you out the window and say you are waiting, i can be out quick. if anything happens, I will be in apartment 16m.
maybe i should come up with you.
if I am not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. that way she will let me go.
nothing's going to happen. I will come with you.
no, I will be fine. I am just visiting a sick friend.
i should not have asked you to come.
you asked me not to come.
promise you will not go inside.
fifteen minutes.
i just have to relax a little. not feel so guilty all the time.
we can still go back. I will walk you home. you sleep a couple of hours, watch some tv, take a bath.
do not be a cop. if you have any doubts about this, it is my fault.
hey cy, guess who is here?
mary ...
it is okay, kanita. come on in.
he looks like a cop.
he is not a cop, he is a medic.  I am cy coates.
frank pierce.
mary said you might be coming.
where is she?
sleeping in the back.
she asked me to pick her up.
i know, but she told me to tell you she wants to crash here a few hours. terrible about her father, is not it?
i better just go in and see her.
mary. mary, we have got to get going.
no, no.
she wanted something to help her sleep.
mary, we really have to go.
I am always interested in people in stressful occupations and being a paramedic is about as stressful as i can imagine. here, sit down. what is it like? tell me some war stories.
got a beer?
that shit is poison, frank. we do not drink alcohol here. what you need is one of these.
did you give mary something called red death?
red death?  tell me something, frank--does killing your clients make good business sense to you? the kids selling that shit have no sense. they will be taken care of, do not worry about that.
i should be going. i just quit.
sleep is all stress reduction. here.  you take one of these, sleep two hours, that is all you need.  why do you think I am telling you this, frank--for my health?  you ought to look at yourself in the mirror, man. kanita, get him a glass of water.
is this what you gave mary?
that is the stuff. i call it the red lion. very king-of-the-jungle.
i guess I will be going.
just take it easy.
you are in the stomach!
you sure?
you are in the stomach! let me try.
one more time!
stomach again.
no way!
frank, take it easy. what happened?
he flipped out.
be cool, man. you are having a paradoxical reaction. it can happen.  did not i tell you this guy was stressed out?
stressed? he is psycho.
you and cy have a nice talk? he tell you about sunrise enterprises, helping people? well, I have seen him hurt people. why are you following me?
because you can barely walk.
what is it? you want to help me, you feel sorry for me? keep it to yourself.
i need to sit down a minute.
or maybe you wanna fuck me? everyone else has.
you are late, pierce. i know, but i can not fire you. I have got nobody to work sixteen xray with walls.
no ...
i got some forms here to fill out about that accident when you get the time.  I will fire you tomorrow. i promise.
what if there is no tomorrow?
go on, get outta here, pierce, before i give you a big hug.  i love this guy.
I am sick, tom. i need a cure.  vitamin b cocktail, followed by an amp of glucose and a drop of adrenaline. not as good as beer, but all i got.
come on, frank. there is blood spilling in the streets.
these are hard times, tom.
yeah. great, is not it?
great to be drunk. sobriety's killing me.
look up, frank. full moon. the blood's going to run tonight. i can feel it. our mission: to save lives.
our mission is coffee, tom. a shot of the bull, puerto rican espresso.
ten-four. el toro de oro. blast off.
the cure's not working, tom. maybe we should go back to the hospital.
do not worry, kid. tom'll take care of you. put your head out the window, get some of that summer air. listen to the music. el toro de oro. andale. pronto.
tom, where are the band-aids? this is an ambulance, is not it?
look out!
where you going?
c'mon, tom. the city's burning.
whatja doing?
i feel the need, the need for speed. I am driving out of myself.
the brakes are shot.
I have taken that into consideration.
you okay?
i never felt better in my life.
mr. oh.
it is early for him.
that is all right, we are not meant to do oh tonight. something is going to happen. i can feel it.
whadda we bring?
better bring it all.
get this, frank--we got two patients. number one, the scarecrow outside. number two misses the railing but breaks both legs on the balcony, then throws himself through a glass window, heads to the bedroom, where he is now passed out.
well, he is the steakhead of the night, then.
i do not think the fire people can touch him out there.
how is he doing?
i have not had a chance to see him yet. I am going to take care of sleeping beauty.
does that hurt?
no!
they are going to torch the fence. you are going to feel the metal getting warm, maybe very warm.
i can not hold up my head anymore.
so, frank, am i going to live?
you are going to live.
I have been thinking about things. meditating on my financial future. you guys gave me plenty of time to meditate on the future. whatja do, stop for chinese on the way over? there is plenty of food in my place.
i was tired. i needed a coffee.
what about kanita?
dead.
that is too bad. get some money, a nice looking girl on your arm, and everyone wants to take a piece. some kid i would not let wash my mercedes is in my house, shooting at me. damn, i thought i could make it onto the balcony like tiger. he is fat, that is why, falls faster. I am trying to watch my weight, and look what happens. am i shot, frank?
no.
boy can not shoot for shit, either. goddamn that is hot.
you can not believe how much he is improved.
how many times have you shocked him tonight?
fourteen. we finally got him a room upstairs. should be up there in a couple of hours.
what do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
that is good, frank. no, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. it goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. it sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. amazing, is not it?
a medical miracle.
i heard cy coates was brought in. he looked pretty bad.
he will be all right.
too bad. he called me up today, can you believe that? i do not know how he got my number. he asks me do i want to come over and see him, i tell him I would rather go to a leper colony. he says there is a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. i told him i hope he is right. that they kill him. that is what i told him.
it will be a while before he is up and running again.
ok, last night i was weak. it will not happen again. and all that shit i said--it was just because i was stoned. forget it.
no problem. thanks for letting me crash. it was the best sleep I have had in months. i used some of your soap.
i wish these people would leave already. i can not listen to another story. did you see him?  that doctor says the brain is coming around. they are waiting for the heart to stabilize. i do not know who to believe. he says they still have to keep him tied up.
can i bring you something back to eat--a falafal, some pizza?
no, we just ate. i only remember how tough my father was. now i know he had to be like that, to make us tough. this city'll kill you if you are not strong enough.
no, the city does not discriminate. it gets everybody.
this is not a good time.
there is no time.
get ready, frank. missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. there is going to be trauma tonight!
as long as we keep moving. no standing still.
c'mon, look at your screen. give up some blood!
c'mon, tom, pick up a job.
you want some bum in the bus terminal? we will wait for a real call.
let's get in a fight, then.
who with?
that is your job. just keep driving, keep moving. no stopping. we are sharks. we stop too long, we die.
let's break something, tom. let's bust something, bomb something.
what do you want to break?
i do not know--let's break some windows.
why?
destruction, distraction. i feel the need.
you need a reason, frank. you do not just go around breaking people's windows. that is anarchy.
what is the reason? give me a reason, tom.
let me think.
this guy's been terrorizing the neighborhood for weeks, ever since he got outta jail, wreaking general havoc, contributing to the bad name of the place. the term "menace to society" was made up for him.
he is crazy. he can not help it.
well, why do not they put him away? prisons do not want him. i took him to the hospital yesterday and here he is again.
look at that. tell me that is a crazy person. every move is calculated. he knows exactly what he is doing. this is the guy. I have been after him for weeks. he is quick, runs like a rat, tough for one person, but with two of us--
okay, whatta i do?
if he sees me, he will run, so I will get out here. you start talking to him about baseball or something while i sneak around behind and get down and you push him. when he falls we get him.
that is ridiculous.
believe me, it always works. the simpler, the better.
you learn that in the army?
that is a hell of a swing you got there, noel. I am thinking strawberry in his prime.
strawberry am not shit. drug pussy.  me.  i swing like reggie. mr. october. number three, game six, world series.
here, you try.
no, I would better not.
sure, sure, give go.
yeah?
what the hell.  the next year, tiebreaker for the division, in boston, yanks down two to nothing, bucky dent steps to the plate.
oh man, bucky.
the pitch, high heater. bucky knows what is coming. he steps in, smash, over the green monster.
get the kit! we are going to tube him!
frank!
do it!
frank!
we are going to save you, noel. you are going to be all right.  do it, tom! I will call for fucking backup, i swear!
you are crazy.
last show of the night.
jesus christ. nurse crupp!  anybody else hurt?
no.
crazy fucker.
where is burke?
upstairs. 212. had to shock him twice more.
who is it?
frank.
come on up.
he is dead, rose. your father passed.
