hemmings!  sam, i thought i told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
...-fall.
yes, captain brynner, you did, but-but--
but...
...what, sam?  can't i go down to the loading dock for a few hours without coming back to find a major...
...screwup?
uh, with all due respect, sir, dr. long told me to prep the field for detonation at...
...noon.
jesus chri--  we're on a very slippery slope here, sam.  a covert military operation riddled with civilian...
...scientists.
you don't think it's that bad, do you, sir?  i mean, long's spent the last two years developing his defoliant.  the stuff can't even kill crabgrass yet.
where's their protective...
...gear?
it's a hundred degrees...
...out here, captain.  don't you think the guys deserve a break?
they'll get a break tomorrow.

mr. sweeney, how goes it?
well,  costello's finished with the stability profile, but abbott is still chewing on the load file.
so reaction temperature is fifty degrees.
well, your prediction was on the nose.
how much longer for the range and power projections?
i don't know.  um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. maybe...another hour?
we don't have an hour.  we're already supposed to be shut down.
doc-...
...-tor long.
what the hell is all this about a detonation today?  we're scheduled...
...to be off the island tonight.
and i changed the schedule.
i don't work for you, captain brynner.
sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
you know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-...
...-lar.
this isn't some kind of pissing contest, long.  you may be in charge here, but those men out there are my responsi-...
...-bility.
look, this is a scientific experiment, okay?
if it works, your stock at the pentagon will go up along with mine.  i don't think i need to mention you could use the help.
the nsa thinks the un is onto your work...
...here, and the white house is screaming about chemical weapons,  and we're...
...sittin' here with our hands in the goddamn cookie jar!  and let me tell you something else.  i didn't join the service to let people like you turn...
...the united states into the kind of country we're supposed to be fighting against.
but you have no choice but to follow orders.
now listen to me.
now, i know.  you have moral objections to what we're doing here, but believe...
...me, if i thought there was any real danger, i-i wouldn't go forward.
you have my word on that.
all right.  one more shot, provided...  we're off the island tonight.
let's proceed.
dr.  long!
i got eight thousand yards. radius is five...
...miles.
what?
"i am become death, the...
...destroyer of worlds."
no!
no!

you'll kill us all!
damn you, long!  my people are out there! your people are out there!
it's too...
andrew...
...i wish they would've let me say something...
...about--
there's nothing to say, doctor.  someone had to take the fall, and they still need you, whereas...i've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side, as you once said.

ext. fort leavenworth - ten years later - day.

been trying to figure out your secret.
my secret?
yeah.  ten months we've been fishin' this river together.  we use the same equipment, more or less...
...but you pull twice as many fish out of the water as i do.
and i'm good at this.  been doing it since i was a kid.  but you, i don't know.  somehow you think...
...like a fish.
no, that's not possible, mason.  the trout...
...is a perfect hunter.
he's brains without ambition...
...sensitivity without neurosis.  he's...
...the master of his realm.
how can we ever hope to win against the trout?
there's only one way you can do it, mason.
turn the power of the hunter against him.
tie a fly...
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
...forcing him to strike.  and only then does our noble friend realize that the prey...can bite...
...back...
...and that power...
...without caution...
...is death.
some people might say you're readin' an awful lot in-...
...-to a simple thing like...
...fishin'.
some people might.

goddamn it, ma-...
...-son.  of all the days for you to show up late.  first, the idiot april calls in sick.  then i got a bad tooth...
...and then my night man shows up when he feels like...
...it.
darlene, it's five-thirty.  now, i worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...
...-time,  remember?
oh.  well, i have got to get to the dentist be-...
...-fore he closes, which means you're gonna have to cover the grill and the floor.
i can handle it.
mm.  it doesn't take a genius.
oh, caught a few, lost a few.
story of my life.  well, one thing you won't lose is that friend of yours back there, i'll tell you that.
oh, no?
oh, you're two of a kind, doc.  oh, he may not have your sheepskins, and...
...well, most of the time he looks like something the cat might have dragged in, but, you know...
...he's smart enough to get you...
...somehow.
there's something else too.
uh, we both like to fish.
secrets.
ah.
his i know.  yours i don't have a clue.  but if it wasn't for you, i think he'd have drifted right on through this town.

you know, i have yet to get a simple cup of coffee and a meal in this place, darlene.
and you ain't gonna start now.
yeah?
be sure you feed bosco.
and don't give him any ice cream...
...like april.  it gives him gas. and make sure there's  two pots of coffee...
two pots of coffee...
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.
...ready before the morning crowd blows in.  i got it...

is this stool taken?
no, go--
you look good, richard.
you look fit...healthy...
...not at all like a man responsible for the deaths of eighteen peo-...
...-ple.
is that why you're here?  to blame...
...me?  well, you could've saved yourself the trip.
i know where the  blame belongs.  but i didn't put you in prison, andrew.  the government did...
...that.
oh, i'm well aware of what the government did, i assure you.  actually, i've just come to say how grateful i am to you...
...and the government.
grateful?
mm-hm.
together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
do you remember telling me once that all through my career, i'd never fit in?  well...
...you were right, of course.  but after...
...years of thinking the matter over, i began to see that the whole thing wasn't really my problem.
what rational man could fit in with the sorts of things our government was doing? the sorts of things you've...
...always done, richard?
do you think i haven't seen the bodies of those...
...men every time i've closed my eyes?  but after you went away, i--
went away?
"went away."  i like that.
almost quaint.
all right.  after they put you away...
...i began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on horn island.
and let me guess.  you failed.
so far, ye-yes.
why is it you scientists can create implements of destruction...
okay, doc.
the usual.  doc.
ext. u.s. army research laboratory/guard gate - jerome - night.
morning, doc.  awful early, aren't ya?
couldn't sleep, pumper.  is everything, uh, all right tonight?

...-ty.
where's sam?
sam?  andy gave sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
where do you want this stuff?
freezer in the back.
great.
art.
so, mason, last wednesday night, uh...were you out...
...uh, drifting around like the trash you are, or were you here workin'?
if it was wednesday night, i was workin'.
do you recognize this young man?
nope.  is there a prob-...
...-lem?
you find yourself wearing a...
...badge someday, then you can ask the questions.  until then...
...you answer mine.
got that?
so you don't remember...
...selling this young man beer wednesday night.
i don't sell beer to minors.  i take that kinda thing...
...seriously.
that's not the way i...
lying?
mason, you wouldn't know the truth if it bit you.  we've got your whole record.  we know about the-the conviction for vagrancy...
...public drunkenness....
i didn't sell the boy any...
...beer.
shut your mouth until i tell you...
...to talk, son.
you know, i gotta tell you.  that really bothers me, somebody calls me "son."
then how about if i call you "ass-...
that little geek is my...
...son.
all right.  enough. look...
you got a prob-...
...-lem too?
no, sir.  i've never seen this guy before.

sure as hell have met a few assholes like that, though.
that's my business.
no argument there.
the guy's a fuckin' moron.
hey, i'm with you on that one, my man. prick.
look, you need me to sign an invoice or somethin'?
uh, between this month and last month, you owe four hundred and seventeen dollars.  and we need that in cash.
since when does...
...darlene pay you in cash?
since today.  new policy.

yeah, well, darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. move.

well, he told me to collect cash.
andy.  another fuckin'...
...moron.
hey, you and i are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'.
uh, huh?
except for the fact that i need cash.
he could've called first.
he could've.  that-that's true.  but that would've been smart...
...and fair...
...two things andy is not.  uh, but i tell you what.
bein' that it's cash, i'm gonna give you ten percent...
...off.  say, uh, three seventy-five. seein' that we both have so much love...
...for andy, i'll tell him i lost a few cartons comin' over  the mountain.
that'll make up the difference, huh?
huh?
well, darlene usually gives me a signed check for emergencies.  i could always give you that.
oh.
why don't i--?
no, no, no, no, no, no. wait.

doc!
aw!  oh, jesus.
hang on.  hang on.
mason.
shit!  oh, shit.

yeah, that's my truck.
mason, you have to take this...
...to fort mcgruder in his truck.
wait.  this town is full of trucks.  nice new trucks.  you don't need to go...
...take my sorry old truck.
we do need your truck.
call an ambulance.
no...
so you called the damned thing elvis
i had no idea how powerful it was.
eighteen men were k- killed in sec-...
...-onds...with just a fraction of what's in...
...here.   mason...

...about the man who did this, he's-he's comin' after it.
you-you can't let him...
...have it.  you have to...have to get it to m...to mcgruder.
hey, actually...
there.
check it out.
move.  this is already affecting our schedule.
int. brynner's van - night.
dennis, radio the bikes.  i wanna know if so much as a squirrel...
ext. brynner's van - night.
...comes up that road.
int. darlene's store - night.
the compound has to be kept cold...
...or it'll ignite.
cold?  cold.  how cold?
never let it reach fifty degre-degrees.
and what if it does?
everything will die, mason.
it's clean.
check the immediate area.
this was supposed to be a...
...quick in and out.
you have ten percent of a hundred million dollars comin' your way.  i think we can impose on you for a little overtime.
you're the only one i can trust.
the only one who understands what this me-...
...-m-means, mason.
doctor.
sorry, man.  he's dead.
no.
it's after five...
int. darlene's store - night.
get 'em on line, then stall.  long can't have gotten far.
closin' down, sir.
vaughn, burke, move to the end of the street.  fan out and work your way back to the motel.
we gotta get help.  aw, fuck!  damn.
mornin'.
is this your establishment?
yeah, they call me dar-...
....-lene.
well, then, how about a cup of coffee, darlene?
iced coffee.
i assume you want that to go.
assumptions are always...
...dangerous.
quite a getup for jacking...
...deer.
i beg your pardon?
uh, you wanna hunt outta season, it's cool with me.  but mostly, well, they just take a six...
...and a rifle.  you, on the other hand...
...look like you're after something more dangerous.
actually, i was just looking for a restroom.
i assume you have one.
assumptions are always dangerous.
hey.
hey, be cool.
be cool.  be--
that was quick.

to tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the tech center.  maybe you know him. richard long.
we're worried...
...about him.
i'll keep an eye out.
doc...
...long.
doc long.  yeah, i know him.  weirdo guy. he comes in from...
...time to time, yeah.
not tonight...
...though.

odd, then, that his car...
...should be right outside.
like i say, doc long's...
what did i say?
dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
i need your truck.

no, no, no.  you don't need my truck. you need somebody else's truck...
...and a shitload of ice.
look, if i don't get this stuff to mcgruder, it's goodbye, andy's ice cream, goodbye, jerome, goodbye, mon-...
...-tana.
wait, wait.  you don't believe the dead guy, do...
...ya?
yeah, i believe him.  he was my friend.
for cryin' out loud.
hey, listen!  do you know what i think?  i...
...think he was a wacko.  and i think that g.i. ninja's a bigger wacko.  and i think you're the biggest wack-...
...-o of all, wantin' to be a part of this wacko shit!
i need your help.
you are seriously mistaken if you think you are going anywhere in my...
...truck.
then you drive me to mcgrud-...
...-er.
look...i got two tons of the world's nastiest ice cream sittin' in a truck that should've been retired ten years ago.  that shit will be worthless by noon.
and if that elvis shit...
...is as dangerous as you seem to think it is, i'm gettin' my ass as far away from you and it as possible.
peace.
all right.

wait, wait, wait.  hold up.  hold up.  look.
you want cash?
you want cash?
i got, like, uh....
i got, uh....
i got fifty bucks.  i'll get more.
i'll rent the truck from you.  you can stay here, you can go.  whatever you want.
no.
all right, then how about this?
hey, you're gonna piss me--  what the hell are you supposed to be...
...doing?!
i need your truck!
you are not takin' my truck!
go on.
would you hurry up, please?
look, put this in the back.  keep it safe.

there we go.  there we go.  did you keep it safe?  did you
what the hell is with you, dog?  he's the one with the damn gun.
you gave him ice cream, didn't you?  come on, let's go.
yeah, to keep him off my ass.
what did you do that for?  it makes him mean as a snake.
that dog was mean before i met him.
that dog ain't mean.
i'm gonna stomp your a--
come on, get in the truck.
i'm gonna bust a mudhole in your ass. i'm gonna--  don't tell me to shut-- it's none of your business.  man, i can talk all i want to.
shut...
...up.
are you kiddin'?

come on!
damn.
what the hell's goin' on?
it happens to this piece of shit...
...all the time.

sir, all potential customers have been informed of the delay.  fur-...

no.  a pair of average citizens have decided to risk their lives for their country.  i almost remember what that feels like.
no cell.
suppose you're gonna shoot me because you can't get service on my cell phone.
billings?  no, no, no, no, no.  we need to go to mcgruder.
no, you gotta go to mcgrud-...
...-er.
no, no, no, no, no.  we gotta go to mcgruder!  i go where the truck goes!
no, no, no.
to get to mcgruder, you have to go through missoula, and i ain't goin' to missoula.
no way.  we're goin' through mcgrud-...
...-er.
i ain't goin' through missoula!
am i missing somethin' here?
look...i kinda borrowed the truck from andy.
borrowed.
yeah, borrowed!
you stole this truck.
you stole this truck!
i did not steal this truck!
you stole this truck! that's...
...what all the bullshit about the cash was, wasn't it?!  you stole this truck, and now you're trying to sell...
...the ice cream for money!
i didn't steal the truck! he owed it to me!  anyway, the important thing is i'm not goin' through missoula!
look, i don't give a shit if you go through missoula at a hundred miles an hour.  we're goin' to mcgruder.
i'm about to get in your ass like last year's underwear, man.
that's...
...fine.
i ain't playin' that.

oh...

all right.
okay!  all right!

thanks.
it must've happened right after we left.
missoula's reporting the refrigerator truck as a stolen vehicle.  i told you mason was walking shit.
pappas, that other guy was unloading ice cream into a freezer.  now, what could he have to do with a military scientist, huh?
the sooner you get up the lab, the sooner you'll figure it out.

and where are you going?
after that re-...
elvis is on ice again.
okay.
nice job back there.

don't gimme that "nice job" shit, man! they still got a vanload comin', and what do you got besides an empty...
...gun?!
i was thankin' you, asshole!
kiss my ass!

probably because they know a psycho when they hear one.
no...
...i'm not the psycho.
hey, take a look at your situation and...
...reconsider that statement there, night shift.  you're psy-...
...-cho and a hijack-...
...-er!
hi--!  the gun was empty!
every time i look at you, i wanna hit...
...you.
you wanna hit me?
and i'm a peaceful man, and...
...i believe in live and...
yeah...
...let live.
...you stole the truck to uphold your principles, right?
i did not steal the truck.

it was owed to me.  you stole the damn...
...truck!
shut up, shut up!  it's beeping.
well, then, that means it's call...
...waiting!
you  snatch that  phone  from me one more time, i'm--
hey!  hey!  andy's ice cream.
dutiful citizens, you have something which i have waited years for.
int. brynner's van - day.
give it to me now, or you'll be dead...
...within five minutes.
it's for you.
yeah?
contrary to what dr. long may have told you, this is neither...
...your concern nor your fight.  relinquish the package and you can go.
i don't know what the hell...
what'd he say?
don't be tedious, waiter.  dr. long called it elvis.
you have no idea what you're in possession of, do you?
int. ice cream truck/cab - day.

listen, shithead!
i got three thousand dollars of highly perishable ice cream products that taste bad enough when it's...
...frozen!  so if you don't mind--!
just give me elvis and i'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
i don't ever wanna see another ice cream...
gimme this god-...
...-damn phone.
talk to me.
int. brynner's van - day.
i want you to look at one another...
...and ask a simple question -   are you actually prepared...
...to die for a country that's...
...never done a thing for you?
because if you don't give me that cylinder, your lives will end...
...on this miserable road to nowhere.
and i can't guarantee the end will be quick.
elvis is fuckin' dead, man.  get yourself some cds.

hey, and what if we  don't make it?!

your weedkiller on steroids goes down with us!  everybody  dies!

there's nothing in here, sir.  they got away with it.
all right.  let's clear the mess and move out.

uh-oh.
what?
this thing just went up a degree.  ice cream's not workin'.
this river's fed by a glacier.  willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
okay.
worth a try.

hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
...did you?
you're fucked, man.
see, now why would you do that to a man in my posi-...
...-tion?
hey, i didn't steal the truck.  you...
...stole the truck.
hey, i told you i did not steal that truck.  andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...
...piece of shit was worth.
it won't even start half the time.
you know what i'm sayin'?
i deserve a lot more than that truck! ten years, ten years i busted my ass for that fat rat bastard.
and he swore, he swore once i got a degree...
...there'd be a sales rep desk with my name on it.  but every time something opened up, there'd be some idiot cousin...
...or nephew or some good old boy...
...just ready to just slide him right in there.  and what about me, huh?  what about arlo, huh?  what about my needs? you know, i got a-i got student loans...
...overdrawn bank accounts.
nobody's lookin' out for my interests.  my credit was fucked!  and then when he promoted sam over me, i just snapped.  so i split.
so you took his...
...truck.
so i took his truck, yeah.
yeah.
you know.
this river ends at a hydro dam...
...in missoula.  all we need to do is get to mason before anyone else does.
carl, dennis, get out of sight.
officer pappas, i'm glad you're here.
mind if you tell me what's goin' on?
i'm colonel brynner, u.s. special operations com-...
...-mand out of fort bragg.
we were called in by the jerome base...
...to pursue a man who's stolen government proper-...
...-ty.
right.  tim mason.
you know the suspect?
yeah, he's wanted in connection with a death this morning at the jerome...
...general store.
richard long.
that's right.
long went missing from the tech center this morning along with a very dangerous...
you know, four years ago, i was a split end at kentucky state.
we were nationally  ranked.
how wonderful for you.
started every game my senior year.  not all-american or anything, but not bad. anyway, the real star was my best friend, the quarterback.  got taken in the first round.
robert del rio?
yeah, robert del rio.
i remember him.  got in a car crash or somethin'.
we were celebrating right after the draft, going from bar to bar.  i was drivin'.
and i put the car into a ditch.  he spent eighteen weeks in the...
...hospital.
never gonna throw a ball in the pros.
couldn't deal with it.  so i split.
and  things sort of just went downhill from there.
anyway, about ten months ago, i wound up in jerome, workin' for darlene.
well, shit.  could be worse.  i mean, we're both up shit's creek, but at least we have a paddle.
we got two paddles.

deputy art lewis, jerome county sheriff's department.
uh-huh.
i don't suppose you'd like to tell me what this is all about.
i will tell you what i...
colonel vitelli.  we got a busted-in cold vault inside.

looks like it.  yes, sir.
alert seventy-fifth rangers.  code blue. tell them elvis has left the building.
what the hell are you talkin' about...
...colonel?
have you i.d.'d the bodies?
they were all wearing hardware.
any of them richard long?
no, sir.
well, i've got dr. long's body down at the coroner's office.
one of our units is pursuing a suspect up the thirty-...
...-five.
who's your suspect?
a man named tim ma-...
...-son.
run a check.  fbi, interpol.
yes, sir.
if you're right, lewis, this mason is one hell of a pro.  he must have a service record and a paper trail some-...
mason?  no, he's a soda-jerk drifter, a hamburger flipper.
it could be a cover, i suppose.
listen, arlo...
...for whatever it's worth, i'm sorry i dragged you into this...
...shit.
to tell you the truth, you didn't.
not completely, anyway.
i mean, if that gun was...
...loaded, i didn't buy you as a shoot- ...
...-er.  it was your friend...
...long.  somethin' about that look in his eye when he talked about that elvis...
...shit.
well, all the same.  if we get to missoula, help me find a car.  i'd appreciate it.  then...you can...
...split.
split?  i wouldn't get ten...
...miles.

like i said, i got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here.

that is loud!  i'm
whoo!

int. andy's ice cream factory/stairwell - day.

int. andy's ice cream factory/andy's office - day.

it's, uh, parked just off of highway thirty-five.
i did what i could for you...
...arlo, and you screwed me for it. now, where's my goddamn truck?
i ain't got time to argue with you today, andy.  but i can tell you this.  takin' your truck pissed you off?

and so missoula's prodigal son returns.
int. hardware store - day.
hello.
i got someone who's anxious to talk to you, mr. mason.
i urge you to be persuasive.
this country trained me to kill...
...without compunction.
well, well, well.
funny situation, ain't it, andy?
three seconds.  one...
why don't you get that tub of shit sam to...
...help you?
look, i'm sorry. i'll make it up to you.  whatever you want.  please!
arlo.
int. andy's ice cream factory/andy's office - day.
all right, all right.  hey, hey.
hey.   mason.
yeah.
i think you oughta cut a...
...deal with this asshole.
even though it is nice to see andy...
...squirm, i don't want his brains all over my shirt...
...or my conscience.
a-and you  owe me...
...man.
yeah, i know, i know.
yeah, i'm listenin'.
then meet me at the dam in fifteen minutes.
yeah, i just....
tryin' to remember somethin' somebody once told me about tyin' a fly.
and only then does our noble friend realize...
...that the prey can bite back.
let me have those.
of which we have more than enough.
int. helicopter - day.
i don't see my container.
you try anything, it goes in...
...the river.
it's a little late for matinee heroics, mason.  just give me the con-...
...-tainer!
where's arlo?
bring him up.

bring him down!



your fellow hero, untouched...
...and unharmed, de-...
...-spite the mouth.
him first.

you all right?




rangers.
go.
ext. dam - day.


bullshit.  you would've killed us anyway.

shit.
just when we have all the cards, vaughn.  take these two behind the van.
move!
ow!


are you all right?
no.
listen, arlo.

hey!
do you know what'll...
...happen if i drop this?
brynner.
well, lieutenant vitelli.
good to see you again, leo.
pleasant surprise.
i can't say it's a surprise.
and i certainly can't say it's pleasant.
as soon as i heard elvis was on the loose, you came to mind.
i checked your release date.  i never liked coincidences.
and i don't like deviations from plans, leo, as i'm sure you re-...
colonel, sir, who the hell is this guy?
he was major andrew bryn-...
yeah, i had a small problem with members of our side murdering civil-...
...-ians.  but i assure you, leo...
...i lost all my squeamishness at leav- ...
...-enworth.  i'll have no compunction at all about using this.
hm.  the wind's northwest.  that oughta be...seattle.
or i may be wrong.  the breeze could be gusting south.  that'd be billings...
...maybe even salt lake, not to mention casper...
...destry, fair oaks....
knowing you, brynner, you've got buyers waiting to buy! you're not gonna use that...
...here!
and i'm warning you, leo.  don't test me. get your men and your machines off my radar screen in five, or three million people will die.
i'll do it.
tell the choppers we're lifting off!
it's not over, brynner.
sir, we can't just let him get away with this!
gomez, you fight the battles you can win.  now, we've been outmaneuvered here.  brynner's next move is gonna be to get elvis out of the country and sell him to the highest bidder.  to do that, he has to have planned an exit point.  that's where we intercept him.  that's where we make our play.  now you and your men back off.
all right, let's move...
they're takin' off.
huh?
they're movin'.

dennis!
get your links set up!
i wanna patch in from...
...here!
what about these two?
we're gonna use them for demonstration  footage.
having witnessed the effects myself, i can assure you it'll be very useful when the bidding starts.
get 'em in the  middle of the dam.
sir.
all right.  tell the pilot we'll be a half-hour.
ext. dam - day.
carl!  set up the camera.
int. brynner's van - day.

it won't be long, gentlemen.

and it won't be pleasant.
but...
...such is the price...of patriotism.
vaughn.
hey!
hey, just shut up.
we're gonna die!
arlo, shut up.

we're gonna die!
we're gonna die!
hey, hey, hey.

put your hand in my pants.
what?

we're gonna die, and you want me to do some freaky shit like that?!
arlo!  arlo.
reach into my pocket.

come on!
oh.
okay.
yeah.
okay.

okay.  all right, man.  okay.

okay.
all right.  okay.

okay.

arlo!

i'm sorry.  i'm a little
i'm on it.

...to him.
what?
you got elvis?!
sometimes the prey bites back.
go!

stop.

hang...
...on!

aw, shit.  would you be more care-...
...-ful?!
okay.  okay.
besides, how are we gonna sell something we don't have?
nothing has changed, i assure you both. the army still thinks we got elvis.  they had a tactical withdrawal.  it's just those two amateurs now.  do you really want to concede a hundred million dollars to them?

ext. highway - day.
carl, establish contact with that deputy we met earlier.  he'll be more useful now.
int. postal van - day.
oh, fuck!
forty-five seven!

here's what i want you to do.
...you, mason?
yeah, yeah...
we!
i've got the real thing!
we've got elvis!
what?  say again, ma-...
...-son.
what we gave brynner on the dam was a phony!
we've got the real thing!
where are you now...
...mason?
i'm at mile marker...
here...
...they come!
and brynner's right on...
...our ass!
he's comin' up fast!
hit him.
int. postal van - day
shit!
int. brynner's van - day.

unbe-fucking-lievable.

i said let me see your hands now!
you redneck idiot, do you have...
...any idea what's goin' on here?!
yeah, asshole.  i'm puttin' a murder suspect and a guy who...
...stole a truck under arrest.

now raise 'em!
let me put it in easy terms, aristotle. we are carrying a damn bomb...
...that is going to explode...
...if we don't get out of this tunnel!
int. gomez's helicopter - day.
no sign of 'em...
int. vitelli's helicopter - day.
mason, what is the temperature of elvis?!
forty-seven.
if you're not out of there soon, i have got to seal the...
...tunnel!
god!  they're gonna seal it.
well, why don't they talk to the sage of jerome here?!
what the hell's a sage?
listen, pappas...
...there's a colonel...
...on the other end of this phone.
his name's vitelli.  talk to him.  he's right out-...
...side!
what happened to colonel brynner?

listen, deputy.
he's the dude...
...the guy the army guys are lookin' for!
bullshit.  put the phone down, mason.
wait.  listen to me, pappas.  if you don't let us by...
...we're all gonna die in this...
...tunnel now!
just go check the temperature.
don't move!

shoot me.

he must've had a damn arsenal in there.
int. tunnel - day.
well, hell, the smoke's gonna kill us anyway!
there's gotta be...
...another way  outta here.    hey.

they aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  arlo.
hey-hey-hey-hey-hey.  we are heroes, my man.  it's time to start actin' like it.

stop limpin' around like that.
excuse me.  i got a bullet in my leg.
always the negative...
all right, gentlemen. we're about done here.  fine job.
thank you.
your country and a lot of innocent people in it...
...owe you.
us.  owe us.
you did help a little.
who drove the ice cream...
...truck that kept elvis cool?
who had to put a gun to your head?
who put the big hurt on...
...that army nut job to save your narrow butt?
you, arlo.
hello.
you.
right.  you damn skippy.  and now that i am both jobless...
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
...i feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
us.  owes us.
i'll handle this from here, sweet   owes us a little restitution.
we do have to take into consideration that, through your courage...
...and selfless actions, you did save millions of lives.
exactly.
however, you are also non-en-...
...-listed personnel with detailed knowledge of classified secrets falling under the national security act.
in order to protect those secrets, i am authorized to fine you, imprison you...
...to take any extreme measures i deem necessary...
...including the permanently extreme.
i'd say we're about even.
patriotism is its own reward.
i think so too.
yeah.
thank you.
thank you very much.
what about all that "no need to get in the man's...
...face" crap you've been telling me?
i was not in the man's face.  i was nego-...
...-tiatin'.
look.  that's negotiating? he threatened to kill...
...us.
but he didn't.  see, that's negotiation.
no.
that's bullshit.
bullshit, yeah.  well...if we're not gonna be famous, at least this'll be a great story to tell some ladies in a bar or somethin'.
arlo, nobody's gonna believe us.
oh!
oh, oh!
i feel faint.
ooh.
you know, it's, uh-it's very hush-hush, as we say in the spy game.
yeah.  yeah, yeah, yeah.
it all started with our mission in istanbul.
yeah.
i was undercover as a tennis player.
yeah.
my code name was blackjack.  night shift was my coach.  uh-uh-uh, i'm sorry. mason was my coach.

uh, he handled rackets, and i carried the balls.

you see, that was a-that was my mission.
big balls.
that's right.
oh.
