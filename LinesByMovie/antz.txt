i feel...isolated.  different.  i've got abandonment issues.  my father flew away when i was just a larva. my mother didn't have much time for me...when you have five million siblings, it's difficult to get attention.  i feel physically inadequate -- i've never been able to lift more than ten times my own weight.  sometimes i think i'm just not cut out to be a worker.  but i don't have any other options.  i was assigned to trade school when i was just a <u>grub</u>.  the whole system just...makes me feel...<u>insignificant</u>.
terrific!  you <u>should</u> feel insignificant!
...i should?
yes!!!  you know, people ask me, "doctor, why are you always happy?" and i tell them it's mind over matter.  i don't <u>mind</u> that i don't <u>matter</u>!  do you get it?  do you get it?
ask me why we're so successful.
why are we so successful?
i'm glad you asked me that question!
what do you see out there?
...ants...
right!  ants!  millions of creatures, each with his assigned task, all pulling together!
you see?  being an ant is being able to say, "hey -- <u>i'm</u> meaningless, <u>you're</u> meaningless."
but -- but i've always felt life was about finding meaning...and then sharing it with someone special, someone you love.
sorry azteca.  here you go, fellas! fresh dirt!  alley oop!  shouldn't we be wearing gloves?  i mean this dirt is very...dirty. doesn't anyone think of hygiene?  boy am i hungry.  i'm so hungry i'm seeing double.  it looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here.  when's lunch?  tomorrow, or the day after?
z, old pal...  shut up!!!  it's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
the squeaky wheel gets the oil.
no, z.  the squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright?  you're a good ant, z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment.  i don't wanna see anything happen to you.  so quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
thank goodness.  breaktime.
break's over.
this colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground.  why are we even digging this thing?
who cares, z.  all i know is, we gotta dig.  we're not the ones in charge.
general, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. the thought of any of my children going hungry...  who's the cutest widdle worker?  you are!  yes, you!  don't forget to brush your teeth!  ship 'er out.  what steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
we are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
yes, what else?
please don't worry, your majesty. leave the worrying to me.  as you know, i'm not an ant of half- measures.  i don't pussyfoot around. this crisis is my number one priority, and i promise you it's being dealt with swiftly, and decisively.
no snacking between meals!  off you go!  now -- what were we saying?
i do not recollect, your majesty. will that be all?
yes, general formica.  carry on, my good man!  i don't know what we would do without you.
princess bala, sir.  your fiancee.
princess!  you look -- outstanding. is there anything i can do for you?
bala has always been a hopeless romantic, general.
it's just that -- well, i'm honored that you selected me, and everything, i just thought the marriage might go a little more smoothly if -- we had a conversation?
conversation...yes...well...  wasn't she briefed?
look, general!  a darling baby soldier!  don't try to be a hero!  just make sure you come back in one piece!  next!
i'll take your suggestion under advisement, princess.  in the meanwhile --
general -- we have to talk sometime!
very well.  carpenter, is there a convenient time to talk vis-a-vis: relationship?
actually, sir, we're ahead of schedule.  we have thirty-six seconds available right now.
outstanding.  princess...?
so, um...how was your day?  what did you do?
well...  i declared war!
oh...and i was afraid we had nothing in common...
fourteen-fifty hours, sir.
duty calls!
i felt the same way before i got married.  confused.  scared.
you did?
yes -- but i did my duty and sorted out all those messy feelings.  the wonderful thing about ant life is that everything is arranged.  even marriage.  you're lucky -- general formica is a paragon of anthood.
yes...he's wonderful...
the club's so <u>stuffy</u>.  i want to try someplace different.
there isn't anyplace else --  except the worker bar.
the worker bar!  yes!  that's where i want to go!
we declared war again?  are you scared?
i'll be back.
did you see that?  how he gave <u>you</u> the beers, not me?  i'm telling you, he's got something against workers.
i don't know what you're talking about, z.
come on -- everybody dumps on us workers.  you soldiers get all the glory.  plus you get to go out into the world, meet interesting insects, and kill them.
yeah, but you get to spend all day with those fabulous worker babes.
weaver, they're career girls. they're obsessed with digging.  no, i'll probably never meet the girl for me.
who said there was a girl for you? i was talking about a girl for me.  don't you want your aphid beer?
i can't help it.  i have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  call me crazy.
z, we've known each other a long time, right?
of course.  you were born two seconds after me.
and all the time i've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. you should quit making waves.  go with the flow.
weaver, i'm an insect, not a liquid.
hey, did you hear what he said?!
poor guy's had one too many scouting missions.
we shouldn't be doing this -- it isn't proper!
i'm the princess, aren't i?
of course --
and do princesses do improper things?
of course not --
then if i go to the worker bar, it isn't improper.  anyway, don't worry. no one will recognize us in our disguises.
time to cut a rug, z!
i'm not in the mood.  even when they're off work, they follow orders.
well, you just sit here and be a party-pooper.
what a bunch of losers.  mindless zombies capitulating to an oppressive system --
wanna dance?
so uh -- how come i haven't seen you around here before?
i work in the palace, i don't get out much.
the palace, hunh?  i bet those royals really live it up.  of course they're all a little, you know, from inbreeding --
<u>what</u>?
are you sure this is a real dance?
well, actually, uh -- i'm sort of making it up --
really?
why should everyone dance the same way?  it's as exciting as watching fungus grow.
you're right!
you -- you think i'm right?
why can't i just do whatever i want to do?  why can't i just go wild?! yahoo!
you watch yours, soldier, or my worker friend will beat you up!
oh, that's okay, i'll let him off this time.  are you crazy?  this guy's built like a pebble!  you know they do great prosthetic antennas nowadays --
aren't you gonna stand up for yourself?
uh oh.  goodbye!  gotta run!
wait!  when can i see you again?
let me think.  hmmnn...  never.  bye!
get real, z!  she just dropped the scarf by accident!
are you kidding?  there were sparks between us!  this scarf is a sign!
it's a sign that you're crazy!  do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
what's gonna go wrong?!  i take your place for the royal inspection.  bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
you have to help me.  please, weaver. think of all the things i've done for you!
i can't think of any.
well i'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
will you introduce me to some worker girls?
you bet!  they'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
maybe i'll get lucky.  you know, z, i wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
wear this.
you're a real buddy.
yeah, i know.
what do i do?
don't tell anyone you're a worker. follow that column over there.  and come right back after the inspection!
lays it on a little thick, doesn't he?  if you ask me, he's one giant bore.
now i've heard a lot of scuttlebutt about a <u>food shortage</u>.  well you boys are gonna be taken care of.  but in the meantime we're gonna eat the enemy for <u>breakfast</u>, we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>lunch</u>, and we are gonna eat the enemy for <u>dinner</u>!
geez, and i forgot my toothbrush.
dammit, i'm proud to be an ant.  and i know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  dismissed.
who is that idiot?
darling, you must encourage the troops -- wave!
you new, kid?
i just joined up.  but i'm quitting! i got a trial membership!
trial membership?  kid, when you join this ant's army, you're in for the full hitch.
you just stick by old barbatus. he'll watch out for you.  whatsamatter, kid?  leave a girl behind?
yeah.  well -- no.  she's kind of playing hard to get.  as a matter of fact, she's playing completely unattainable.  so, what's on the schedule?  a brisk walk?  a foraging expedition?
no -- we're going to attack the termites!
attack?  but -- i hate attacking! it's so hostile!
well, what exactly does our platoon do?  serve beverages?  process paperwork?
our platoon has the best assignment of all.  we're the first into battle!
so we're going back for more armor, right?  i mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
superior numbers, kid!
don't be scared, kid.  barbatus's got yer back.
maybe they went out for the evening. let's leave them a message and head home.
barbatus!  you -- you saved my life!
don't get all sappy about it!
z!  over here!
barbatus?
barbatus!
be honest, kid -- am i hurt bad?
no, no, you're...lookin' good. you've got good color in your cheeks.
no -- i can see it in your eyes.  i'm a goner.  it's alright, z.  in this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  i can't feel my legs...
hang in there, buddy!  you can make it!  just -- take deep breaths, i'll try and find your body -- it's gotta be around here somewhere!
i wonder...what...was it all...for...
barbatus, hang on -- barbatus!!
don't make my mistake, kid... don't...be a grunt...your whole life...
hey, slow it down, big boy.  you're making the rest of us look bad...how come i haven't seen you around here before?
i'm new...i was born yesterday.
tell me about it.
nobody told me digging was so much fun!  you pick up the dirt, you move it, you pick it up again, you move it again -- lots of repetitions, you exercise the forceps, and the pincers --
mmm, yes, i see what you mean...
i don't know what came over me, talking back like that.  i must be going crazy...
sorry i got you in trouble.  but listen, you can share my rations.
are you asking me out to dinner?
no -- i mean yes -- i mean -- if you don't have other plans.
i'll make myself available...listen, better watch out with the backtalk.  i don't know want you to end up like the guy who used to work next to me.  i'm afraid he got... <u>downsized</u>.
no -- you -- you don't understand!
damn, i'm proud of you, boy.  i wish i had a hundred ants of your caliber. the world would tremble.  now, time for some r and r.  you're invited to the royal victory party!
royal victory party?  will...will princess bala be there?
of course.  the entire royal family will be there to honor you.
one to nothing!
wait a minute, that's no soldier -- that's z!
z?  <u>our</u> z?  the little guy made it!
son, you're an ant after my own heart.  a warrior.  an ant that looks death right in the face and <u>laughs</u>.
well, i generally just make belittling comments and snicker behind death's back.  so, tell me, fellow war-monger...do you think princess bala likes men in uniform?
well she better -- she's engaged to one.  <u>me</u>!
engaged?  as in you're getting married?
affirmative.
so...you two are in love?
in love?  i'm just a plain old soldier at heart.  i'll tell you what i love -- the field -- blood -- death -- orders...and the company of other warriors.
wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
...not enough food?
negatory.  <u>too many ants</u>.  and while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
well i, i don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
i tell you son, sometimes, at night, i see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. and always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
oh, hey, that's great, i think i see an old war buddy over there, it's been fun chatting.  good luck with the hallucinations.
you're the hero of the recent termite campaign, aren't you?
well, if single-handedly vanquishing the enemy and slaughtering a whole nestful of termites makes someone a hero, yes i am.
and you are...?
i'm princess bala.
ah, yes.  well, charmed, i'm sure.  so, princess, have you ever danced with a hero?
yes.
oh...oh well then, one more won't matter.
all these parties are so marvellously <u>alike</u>.
they should be...  but there's something funny about that soldier.
may i cut in?
oh, of course --
no, general.  i'm dancing with the war hero.
uh, sorry, general, i...i've always had this animal magnetism, it --
you dance...
divinely?
no weirdly...you remind me of someone...
he was a worker.  i danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. i'm not shocking you, am i?
no...as a matter of fact...
oh my god, it's you!  you're a worker!!!  a filthy, stupid, disgusting worker!
gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, i think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
i can't dance with a worker!
that's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
quiet -- sshhh!!
-- at the <u>worker bar</u>!  you were pretty hot to trot then!
sshh!!!  sshh!!!
what's this?  a <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what i'd call a clever ruse --
arrest him!
can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
what <u>was</u> that thing?
how should <u>i know</u>?
i order you to find out where we are!
alright, alright, i'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
excuse me, i --  pardon me --  and they call them social insects.
climb up that tree and get a better view!
i've been kidnapped by the village idiot.
who's the bigger idiot -- the idiot who gets kidnapped, or the idiot who lets herself get kidnapped by the idiot?
how dare you speak to me like that? i'm the princess!
theoretically, yes.  but is the monarchical hierarchy applicable without the underlying social structure to support it?
of course!  it defines society!  to deny the precept is to say that order is an arbitrary distinction applied by the society itself!
but can there be a society composed of just two ants?
no!  there's no such thing as "just two ants."  you never see just two ants -- you see a million ants!
look around, sweetheart.
i -- <u>hate</u> -- you.
well i guess that makes us even.
ha!  don't make me laugh.  you're crazy about me!  that's why you lied and cheated to get near me!
oh come on, <u>you're</u> the one who came after me -- the swarthy, earthy, sensual worker!
i was <u>slumming it</u>!  i danced with you because you were the most pathetic specimen in the place!
is that the same standard you used to choose general formica?
i <u>didn't</u> choose him.  what kind  of <u>idiot</u> would...  ...<u>choose</u> who she wanted to marry?
now, worker, you shall take me back to the colony, and have your head cut off and stuck on a sharp pole!
well, that's an appealing offer, but...considering the options...  you go back.  me, i'm going to insectopia.
<u>insectopia</u>?  you stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
yeah, well i have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>that</u> direction.
worker!  come back here now!
i've got a <u>name</u>.  it's <u>z</u>.
that's not a name!  that's just a letter!
you know, you're not just workers -- you can be whatever you want to be! look at z!  he started as a worker -- then he became a soldier!
that's right!  he slaughtered hundreds of termites single-handedly!
well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, azteca...
invisible!
no -- an <u>individual</u>!
someone who follows his heart!
right...because every ant's important!
water...water...
water...water -- oh, you already said that.
my skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...i wish i'd never met you, you ruined my life.
<u>i</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  look, i was perfectly happy until i met you -- alright, i was miserable, but i was <u>happily miserable</u>.
we're going to die!
come on -- it's gone!  what are the chances of that happening again?
why didn't i listen to my mother ...why'd i have to go looking for trouble? any ant would have given their left legs to be in my position...what's <u>wrong</u> with me?
want a list?
wait, i hear something!
this lake is huge!  and so close to the colony!  think of the vacation potential!
cut me down a soft leaf so i can take a nap.
listen, "princess", you can't order me around.  out here, you're not the boss anymore -- out here, you're just --
out here i'm just what?
hlllllllp!
stop fooling around in there.
princess, has it ever occurred to you that they're <u>not going to rescue you</u>?
general formica won't let me die out here.  i'm his fiancee.
look.  how many other princesses are there?
five thousand three hundred and ninety -- no.  about five thousand four hundred by now.
and only you can become a queen?
well...no, but --
so what makes you so special?
well...i <u>am</u> the oldest.
dammit, this tunnel is priority a-1! we can't afford <u>any delays</u> on this project!
i've never seen anything like it, general, they're they're...well, look!
notice the big one, holding hands with the female?
well, uh, who notices workers, sir?
no one should have to.  have him brought to me.
so this z...he fancies himself an individual?
yeah...i mean...well...i don't know, really, sir.
well now <u>you</u> haven't fallen for this silly idea of individuality, have you?
oh, no, sir!
good.  you're a good soldier.
thank you, sir.
so tell me.  where's z?
i...i have no idea, sir.
okay, son.
we know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  we know that no ant can be an individual.  no <u>single</u> ant matters, right?
that's correct, sir!
not that one.  or that one.
no, sir!
what do we have on this "insectopia"?
scattered reports, sir.  rumors. nothing reliable.
desperate times call for desperate measures.  get me ant team six.
ant team six...
face it, z, we're lost!  we must have walked halfway across the world by now!  how did i get into this mess...
come on...tell me there wasn't just a little...something between us that first night at the bar.  the night we danced.
what difference does it make...we're both going to starve to death, or get squished, or set on fire...
we've found it!  <u>insectopia</u>!  look at all this food'
you were right...you were right!  z, it's <u>beautiful</u>!
let's dig in!
z...if we don't make it...i just want you to know....
yes?
<u>this is all your fault</u>!!!
come on, z.
forget it.  you go ahead, i give up. i...i don't know what i was thinking. "insectopia".
so...you never did tell me...what made you come out to the worker bar that night?
just looking for fun, adventure, trouble, i guess.
well, "trouble" is my middle name. actually, my  middle name is .985, but i don't tell people.  hey, bala, i...i actually have something of yours...you left it at the bar that night.
sorry, it's been through a war, not to mention everything else...
you held onto this all that time?
well, i...i know it's a little strange, but...i thought it might come in handy if i...needed a scarf someday.  well, to be honest, i just liked having it.
he's...he's dead.  you don't have to look for him anymore.  he was eaten by a praying mantis.
it's a shame he died prematurely...i was hoping to kill him myself.
well you'll never be able to hurt him where he is now.  i miss him already.
you miss him?  <u>why</u>?
because...because he's <u>twice</u> the ant that you are.  i could <u>never</u> go through with marrying you.  i'm -- i'm an <u>individual</u>, and when i get married, it'll be to someone <u>i</u> choose.
why do they have you tied up here?
there's something going on, z --
bala, that -- that lake we found -- i think the tunnel's right underneath it!  -- formica's going to <u>flood the</u> <u>colony</u>!!!  that's what he meant when said there were too many ants!
oh no...
z!  what are you doing?
i know it's crazy, but -- i can't just leave.  don't argue with me.  if i've learned anything, it's that the problems of two people don't add up to a hill of ants in this world.  or beans.  something like that.  anyway, i've <u>got to warn the others</u>.
your majesty, i'm afraid matters of state keep me from attending the ceremony.
but general -- this tunnel is your baby!  you're sure you can't stay ?
'fraid not, your majesty.  goodbye, your majesty.
very well, general -- i know you -- all work and no play!
alright, let's move out!
bala!
mom!
yeah, but i hate drowning more!  now <u>dig</u>!
you heard the ant -- dig!!!
what are you doing?!  attack!!  come on, you yellow-bellies!  don't just stand there, carpenter! make an example of yourself!
uh, actually, we <u>are</u> outnumbered sir...
i mean, i've got the whole package, right?  a great life, a beautiful wife, and a few kids.
a <u>few</u>?
