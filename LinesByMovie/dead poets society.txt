welcome. back, mr. dalton.  how's your father?
doing fine, sir.
your family move into that new house, mr. overstreet?
i hear we're going to be roommates. neil perry.
todd anderson.
why'd you leave balincrest?
my brother went here.
oh, so you're that anderson.
my parents wanted me here all along but my grades weren't good enough.  i had to go to balincrest to pull them up.
well, you've won the booby prize.  don't expect to like it here.
i don't.
hey, i heard you went to summer school?
yeah, chemistry.  my father thought i should get ahead.
well, meeks aced latin and i didn't quite flunk english so if you want, we've got our study group.
sure, but cameron asked me too.  anybody mind including him?
what's his specialty, brown-nosing?
hey, he's your roommate.
that's not my fault.
charlie dalton.
knox overstreet.
todd's brother is jeffrey anderson.
oh yeah.  sure.  valedictorian, national merit scholar
well, welcome to "hell"ton.
it's every bit as hard as they say. unless you're a genius like meeks.
he flatters me so i'll help him with latin.
and english, and trig
but father, i'm assistant editor.
i'm sorry, neil.
but father, it's not fair.
fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
i will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
father, i wasn't disputing you.
when you've finished medical school and you're on your own, you can do as you please.  until then, you will listen to me.
yes sir.  i'm sorry.
you know what this means to your mother, don't you?
yes sir.
you know me, always taking on too much.
good boy.  call us if you need anything.
why doesn't he let you do what you want?
yeah!  tell him off!  it couldn't get any worse.
wait a minute.  i don't let my parents walk on me.
yeah, you just do everything they say! you'll be in daddy's law firm as sure as i'm standing here.  and you'll be approving loans till you croak.
okay, so i don't like it any more than you do.  i'm just saying
then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  all right?!
all right.  jesus, what are you gonna do?
what i have to do.  screw the annual.
i certainly wouldn't lose any sleep over it.  it's just a bunch of people trying to impress nolan.
screw it all.  i don't give a damn about any of it.
i don't know about anyone else, but i could use a refresher in latin.  eight o'clock in my room?
sure.
you're welcome to join us, todd.
so what do you think of my father?
i'll take him over mine.
what?
nothing.
todd, if you're gonna make it around here, you've gotta speak up.  the meek might inherit the earth but they don't get into harvard. know what i mean?
gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  the latin term for that sentiment is "carpe diem." anyone know what that means?
carpe diem... seize the day.
very good, mr._?
meeks.
seize the day while you're young, see that you make use of your time.  why does the poet write these lines?
weird.
but different.
oh come on, cameron, don't you get anything?
how about a trig study group?  right after dinner.
they're friends of my dad.  probably in their nineties or something.
listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
want to come to the study group?
thanks but  i'd better do history.
pleased to meet you.
the pleasure is mine.
it's all right, chet.
it's not all right.  come on, dad
so, uh, where are you in school?
ridgeway high.  how's henley hall, gin?
that's your sister school, right?
sort of.
you going out for the henley hall play?  they're doing "a midsummer night's dream."
chris.  we got it.  let's go.
nice meeting you, knox.  bye, gin.
how was dinner?
terrible.  awful!  i met the most beautiful girl i've ever seen in my life!
are you crazy? what's wrong with that?
she's practically engaged to chet danburry.  mr. mondo jocko himself.
too bad.
it's not too bad.  it's a tragedy! why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
all the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  forget her.  take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
i can't just forget her, pitts.  and i certainly can't think about math!
you really think i should forget her?
you have another choice.
the hoi polloi.  doesn't it mean the herd?
precisely, meeks. greek for the herd. however, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd.  indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."
thigh man?  mr. "k" was a hell raiser.
what is the dead poets society?
any group pictures in the annual?
nothing.  no mention of it.
yes sir.  we were just talking about that.
good.  we're very excited about him.  he was a rhodes scholar, you know.
mr. keating? sir? oh captain my captain.  what was the dead poets society?
ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
i was just looking in an old annual and...
nothing wrong with research.
what did the name mean.  did you only read dead poets.
all poetry was acceptable.  the name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead.
i say we go tonight.  everybody in?
where is this cave he's talking about?
beyond the stream.  i think i know.
that's miles.
sounds boring to me.
don't come.
you know how many demerits we're talking?
so don't goddam come!  please.
all i'm saying is we have to be careful. we can't get caught.
well, no shit, sherlock
who's in?
i'm in.
well...
oh come on, pitts...
his grades are hurting, charlie.
then you can help him.
what is this, a midnight study group?
forget it, pitts, you're coming.  meeks, your grades hurting too?
all right.  i'll try anything once.
except sex.
i'm in as long as we're careful.
knox?
i don't know.  i don't get it.
come on.  it'll help you get chris.
it will?  how do you figure?
women swoon!
but why?
what is it then?
i... i just don't want to come.
but why?  don't you understand what keating is saying?  don't you want to do something about it?
yes.  but
put what?  goddamn it, tell me.
i don't want to read.
what?
keating said everybody took turns reading.  i don't want to do it.
god, you really have a problem, don't you?  how can it hurt you to read?  i mean isn't that what this is all about? expressing yourself?
yaa, i'm a dead poet!
ahh!  eat it, dalton!
this is it.
i went to the woods because i wanted to live deliberately."  i wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!"
all right.  i'll second that.
to put the rout all that was not life.  and not, when i came to die, discover that i had not lived.  pledge overstreet.
the millions are awake enough for physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life.  to be awake is to be alive.
hey, this is great.
if you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  that is where they should be.  now put foundations under them.
god, i want to do everything!  i'm going to explode.
i here and now commit myself to daring!
so avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  a man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  don't use very sad, use morose.  language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  it also won't do in your essays.
i've found it.
found what?
what i want to do!  right now. what is really inside of me.
a midsummer night's dream. what is it?
a play, dummy.
i know that.  what's it got to do with you?
they're putting it on at henley hall. see, open try-outs.
so?
so i'm gonna act!  ever since i can remember i've wanted to try it.  last summer i even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father wouldn't let me.
and now he will?
hell no, but that's not the point.  the point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, i know what i want, and for the first time i'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! carpe diem, goddamn it!
neil, how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?
first i gotta get the part, then i'll worry about that.
won't he kill you if you don't let him know you're auditioning?
as far as i'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of it.
come on, that's impossible.
horseshit.  nothing's impossible.
why don't you ask him first?  maybe he'll say yes.
that's a laugh.  if i don't ask, at least i won't be disobeying him.
but if he said no before then...
jesus christ, whose side are you on?  i haven't even gotten the part yet.  can't i enjoy the idea even for a little while?
by the way, there's a meeting this afternoon.  you coming?
i guess.
none of what mr. keating has to say means shit to you, does it?
what is that supposed to mean?
being in the club means being stirred up by things.  you look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
you want me out...  is that what you're saying?
no, i want you in.  but being in means you gotta do something.  not just say you're in.
listen neil, i appreciate your interest in me but i'm not like you.  when you say things, people pay attention.  people follow you.  i'm not like that.
why not?  don't you think you could be?
no!  i don't know,  i'll probably never know.  the point is, there's nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? i can take care of myself just fine.  all right?
er  no.
no?  what do you mean 'no'?
no.
you know what the dead poets would say: gather ye rosebuds while ye may...
but she's in love with: the moron son of my father's best friend.  what would the dead poets say about that?
i feel like i've never been alive.  for years i've been risking nothing.  i have no idea what i am or what i want to do! neil, you know you want to act.  knox wants chris.
needs chris!  must have chris!
meeks, you're the brain here.  what do the dead poets say about somebody like me?
i hereby declare this the charles dalton cave for passionate experimentation.  in the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
wait a minute, charlie. this should belong to the club.
it should, but i found it and now i claim it.  carpe cavern, guys.  seize the cave.
i gotta get to the tryouts.  wish me luck.
good luck.
neil, how are you gonna do this?
sssh.  that's what i'm taking care of. they need a letter of permission.
from you?
from my father and nolan.
neil, you're not gonna...
quiet.  i have to think.
and don't limit poetry to the word. poetry can be found in a work of art, music, a photograph, in the way a meal is prepared--anything with the stuff of revelation in it.  it can exist in the most everyday things but it must never, never be ordinary  by all means, write about the sky or a girl's smile but when you do, let your poetry conjure up salvation day, doomsday, any day, i don't care, as long as it enlightens us, thrills us and--if it's inspired--makes us feel a bit immortal.
oh, captain, my captain. is there poetry in math?
a yawp?
a barbaric yawp.
good god, boy! yell!
yawp!
again!  louder!
yawp!
louder!
ahhhhhh!
all right!  very good!  there's a barbarian in there after all!
todd, there's a picture of whitman over the door.  what does he remind you of? quickly, anderson, don't think about it.
a madman.
a madman.  perhaps he was.  what kind of madman?  don't think!  answer.
a crazy madman.
use your imagination!  first thing that pops to your mind, even if it's gibberish!
a... a  sweaty-toothed madman.
now there's the poet speaking!  close your eyes and think of the picture. describe what you see.  now!
i... i close my eyes.  his image floats beside me.
a sweaty-toothed madman
a sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
excellent!  have him act.  give it rhythm!
his hands reach out and choke me all the time he mumbles slowly.  truth... truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
don't stop!
from the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying,  it will cover just your head as you wail and cry and scream!
look at this.
what is it?
the god of the cave.
charlie, that was great!  where did you learn to play like that?
my parents made me take clarinet but i hated it.  the sax is more sonorous.
god, i can't take it anymore!  if i don't have chris, i'll kill myself.
knox, you gotta calm down.
no, i've been calm all my life!  if i don't do something, it's gonna kill me.
where are you going?
i'm calling her!
hello?
hello chris, this is knox overstress.
knox.  oh yes, knox.  i'm glad you called.
you are?  she's glad i called!
well, sure!
chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  but you can bring someone if you like.
i'll be there.  the danburrys.  friday night.  thank you, chris.
can you believe it?  she was gonna call me!  she invited me to a party with her!
at chet danburry's house.
yeah.
well?
so?
so you really think she means you're going with her?
well hell no, charlie, but that's not the point.  that's not the point at all!
what is the point?
the point is she was thinking about me! i've only met her once and already she's thinking about me.  damn it, it's gonna happen!  i feel it.  she's going to be mine!
todd, what's the matter?
it's my birthday.
it is?  happy birthday.  you get anything?
this is your desk set.  i don't get it.
they gave me the exact same thing as last year!
oh..
oh.
well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  maybe they thought...
maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  his birthday's always a big to-do.  the stupid thing is, i didn't even like the first one.
look, todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
what?
i mean, this is one special gift!  who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
yeah!  and just look at this ruler!
it's such a strange name!  won't you tell us what it means?
i told you, that's a secret.
isn't he precious?
oh, hi.  i'm glad you made it.  did you bring anybody?
no.
ginny danburry's here.  look for her.
but, chris...
i gotta find chet.  make yourself at home.
charlie...
it's nuwanda.
nuwanda, what is going on?
nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
well, of course not.  it's just that... you could have warned us.
i thought i'd be spontaneous.  i mean, that's the point of this whole thing, isn't it?
where'd you find them?
they were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  said they were curious about the school so i invited them to the meeting.
do they go to henley hall?
i don't think they're in school.
they're townies?!
cameron, what is the matter with you. you act like they're your mother or something.  you afraid of them?
hell no, i'm not afraid of them just, if we get caught with them, we're dead.
no relation.  never heard of him. sorry.
say steve, where's your manners?  here's mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? want some bourbon?
actually i don't
so what the hell's mutt been up to?
actually i don't really know mutt.
to fucking mutt.
well, i'd better find patsy.  say hello to mutt for me.
will do.
yeah!    don't you guys miss having girls here?
miss it?  it drives us crazy.  that's part of what this club is about.  in fact, i'd like to announce that i've published an article in the school paper, in the name of the dead poets society, demanding girls be admitted to welton, so we can all stop beating off.
you what?!  how did you do that?
i'm one of the proofers.  i slipped the article in.
oh god, it's over now!
why? nobody knows who we are.
don't you think they'll figure out who did it?!  don't you know they'll come to you and demand to know what the dead poets society is?   charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
it's nuwanda, cameron.
that's right, it's nuwanda.
and are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say?  if all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other, what the hell are we doing?
you still shouldn't have done it, charlie.  you don't speak for the club.
hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks?  if they catch me, i'll tell them i made it up.  all your asses are safe.  look, gloria and tina didn't come here to listen to us argue. are we gonna have a meeting or what?
carpe breastum.  seize the breast.
huh?
oh chet, that feels fabulous,
it does?  what?
you know,
don't stop.
stop what?
chet...
what are you doing?!
knox?!
you fucked up little prick!
chet, you don't have to hurt him.
hey guys, why don't you show tina the dead poets garden?
garden?
i think he's sweet.
i think you're sweet.
you know what really excites me about you?
what?
every guy that i meet wants me for one thing my body.  you're not like that.
i'm not?
no!  anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. make me up some more poetry.
but...
please!    it's so wonderful to be appreciated for my mind!
nuwanda?  please?
all right!  i'm thinking!  "let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments; love is not love which alters when it alteration finds or bends with the remover to remove."
don't stop.
"o, no, it is an ever-fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken; it is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
this is better than sex any day.  this is romance!
welton academy, hello?  yes, he is, just a moment.  mr. nolan, it's for you.
what?!
who else was involved in this?
no one, sir.  it was just me.  i did the proofing so i inserted my article in place of rob crane's.
mr. dalton, if you think you're the first to try to get thrown out of this school, think again.  others have had similar actions and they have failed just as surely as you will fail.  bend over and grab your shins.
do you still insist that this was your idea and your idea alone?
yes... sir.
what is this "dead potts society"?  i want names.
it's only me, mr. nolan.  i swear. i made it up.
if i find that there are others, mr. dalton, they will be expelled and you will remain enrolled.  stand up.
what happened? were you kicked out?
no.
what happened?
i'm supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.
what are you going to do? - charlie?
damn it, neil, the name is nuwanda.
this was my first classroom, john, did you know that?  my first desk.
i didn't know you taught.
english.  way before your time.  it was hard giving it up, i'll tell you.  i'm hearing rumors, john, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  i'm not saying they have anything to do with the dalton boy's outburst, but i don't think i have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
your reprimand made quite an impression i'm sure.
what was going on in the courtyard the other day?
courtyard?
boys marching.  clapping in unison.
oh that. that was an exercise to prove a point.  about the evils of conformity.
john, the curriculum here is set.  it's proven.  it works.  if you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same?
i always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
at these boys' age? not on your life! tradition, john.  discipline.  prepare them for college, and the rest will take care of itself.
mr. keating!
i don't know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, mr. dalton, but, whatever it was, i hope you've learned your lesson.
you're siding with mr. nolan?!  what about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
sucking out the marrow doesn't mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, charles.  you still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
but i thought-
yeah?  like what?
like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
yes sir.
so keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
oh captain, my captain.  what if we don't know anything about someone like rahesh non?
rahesh non never existed, mr. meeks. you make him or someone like him up.  no self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one i received:
here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?
i will be with thee straight.
follow me then to plainer ground.  god, i love this!
this play?
yes, and acting!  it's got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world. most people, if they're lucky, live about half an exciting life! if i could get the parts, i could live dozens of lives.
you should come to rehearsals.  i know they need people to work the lights and stuff.
no thanks.
lots of girls.  the girl who plays hermia is incredible.
i'll come to the performance.
chicken shit.  where were we?
yea, art thou there?
put more into it!
yea, art thou there?!
that's it!  "follow my voice.  we'll try no manhood here."  see you at dinner.
father!
neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
father, i--
don't you dare talk back to me!  it's bad enough that you've wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  but you deliberately deceived me!  who put this in your head? how did you expect to get away with it? answer me!
nobody-  i thought i'd surprise you. i've got all as and-
did you really think i wouldn't find out?!  "my niece is in a play with your son," mrs. marks says.  "you must be mistaken," i say.  "my son isn't in a play."  you made a liar out of me, neil! now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
father, i have the main part.  the performance is tomorrow night.  father, please.
i don't care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  is that clear?  is that clear!
yes sir.
we thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
what is wrong with old habits, mr. overstreet?
they perpetuate mechanical living, sir. they limit your mind.
mr. overstreet, i suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  do you understand?
yes sir.
that goes for all of you.  now eat with your correct hands.
visit from my father.
do you have to quit the play?
i don't know.
why don't you talk to mr. keating about it?
what good will that do?
maybe he'll have some advice.  maybe he'll even talk to your father.
are you kidding?  don't be ridiculous.
this is stupid.
it's better than doing nothing.
anything else you'd care to rifle through, mr. dalton?
i'm sorry.  i, we
oh captain, my captain, we came here so i could talk to you about something.
okay.
actually, i'd like to talk to you alone.
damn it, nuwanda.  you idiot.
i couldn't stop myself.
gosh, they don't give you much room around here, do they?
maybe they don't want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
why do you do it?  i mean, with all this seize-the-day business, i'd have thought you'd be out seeing the world or something?
ah, but i am seeing the world, neil. the new world.  seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  it's worth everything.  that's why i came back here. a place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  did you come here to talk about my teaching?
mr. keating, my father is making me quit the play at henley hall.  when i think about carpe diem and all that, i feel like i'm in prison!  i mean, i can see his point.  we're not a rich family like charlie's.  but he's planned the rest of my life for me and he's never even asked me what i want!
you can't live a life for someone else, neil.  you can only live for yourself. have you told your father what you just told me?  have you shown him your passion about acting?
are you kidding?  he'd kill me!
then you're playing a part for him too, aren't you?  a dangerously self- destructive one.
neil, i know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you're feeling.  you have to let him see who you are-  it's your only chance.
i know what he'll say.  he'll say that acting is just a whim and that it's frivolous and that i should forget about it.  he'll tell me how they're counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  you'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  if that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
eighteen!  that's two years!  what about the play?  the performance is tomorrow night!
give your father the benefit of the doubt.  talk to him.  let him see who you are.
isn't there an easier way?
not if you're going to stay true to yourself.
damn.  damn!  if i could just get chris to read this poem!
why don't you read it to her? it worked for nuwanda.
she won't even see me, pitts.
nuwanda recited poetry to gloria and she jumped all over him... right, nuwanda?
chris!
knox!  what are you doing here?
if chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
i don't care.  i love you, chris.  you deserve better than chet and i'm it. please accept these.
knox, you're crazy.
knox, i don't believe this!
all i'm asking you to do is listen.  "the heavens made a girl named chris, with hair and skin of gold to touch her would be paradise to kiss her glory untold."
how'd it go?  did you read it to her?
yep.
all right!  what'd she say?
i don't know.
what do you mean you don't know?
i'll tell you later.
what did your father say? did you talk to him?
yeah.
really?  you told your father what you told me?  you let him see your passion for acting?
yeah.  he didn't like it one bit but at least he's letting me stay in the play. of course, he won't be able to come. he'll be in chicago on business.  but i think he's gonna let me stay with acting.  as long as i keep my grades up.
but what if they see it, nuwanda?
so much the better.
chris!
knox, why are you doing this to me?
you can't be in here.
if they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble.
oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
i didn't mean to make a fool of you.
well, you did!  chet found out and he's nuts.  it took everything i could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. you have to stop this stuff, knox.
but i love you.
you say that over and over but you don't even know me!
of course i know you!  from the first time i saw you, i knew you had a wonderful soul.
just like that?!  you just knew?
of course just like that.  that's how you always know when it's right.
and if it so happens that you're wrong? if it just so happens that i could care less about you?

look, i've got to go.  i'm gonna be late for the play.
are you going with chet?
chet?  to a play? are you kidding?
then come with me.
knox, you are so infuriating!
just give me one chance.  if you don't like me after tonight, i'll stay away forever.
uh-huh.
i promise.  dead poets honor.  come with me tonight, then if you don't want to see me again, i swear i'll bow out.
god, if chet found out he'd...
chet won't know anything.  we'll sit in back and sneak away as soon as it's over.
knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
dead poets honor.
what is that?
my word
i have to go home. chet might call.
it's just for a little while. you promised.

come on boys, don't be shy.
i have something.
