yes, hannah?
i think maybe we are missing the point. it seems to me james' strength as a writer is that he does not take us by the hand. he treats us like adults. he respects us enough to forget us. that takes... courage.
thanks for that. he all right?
i think so... what about you?
me? sure. why?
just checking.
professor tripp.
chancellor.
i got the message you called.
i got the message you called too.
tripp!
how are you, crabtree?
brimming. say hello to my new friend, miss antonia... uh...
the more the merrier.
terry was telling me about you on the plane. it was all so interesting.
i was explaining to antonia how a book comes to be published. what you do as a writer, what i do as an editor...
i sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling.
emily?
your wife.
oh. we are picking her up. downtown.
perfect. well then, shall we?
do you know how many times I have boarded an airplane praying someone like her would sit down beside me? particularly while I am on my way to pittsburgh.
lay off pittsburgh. it is one of the great cities.
if it can produce a miss sloviak you will get no argument from me.
she is a transvestite.
you are stoned.
she is still a transvestite.
mm.
is not she?
it is fine. it is done. basically. I am just sort of... tinkering with it.
great. i was hoping i could get a look at it sometime this weekend. think that might be possible?
i do not know. I am sort of at a critical... juncture.
i thought you were tinkering.
i just mean...
forget i asked. i do not want to pressure you, tripp. but...  ...i get pressure. know what i mean?
that perfume you are wearing, antonia. it would not happen to be cristaile, would it?
why yes. how did you know?
lucky guess.
you did not actually purchase this car, did you. trip??
it was jerry nathan's. he owed me money.
he owes god money. you know, he queered himself for good with esquire.
he said something about being between things.
yeah, between a bookie and a pair of broken legs.
trip??
she left me. crabs.
left you...? who? emily?
this morning. i found a note in the kitchen.
but. ...why did not you say something, tripp? i mean, what are we doing here?
that is a nice greenhouse.
it is mrs. gaskell's. her hobby.
i thought you were mrs. gaskell's hobby, tripp.
piss off, crabs. i lost a wife today.
oh, I am sure you will find another. you always do.
easy there.
I am sorry. it is these goddamned shoes. i do not know how anyone actually walks in these things.
who is he barking at now?
he is still barking at me. he is blind.
i need to talk to you.
that is funny. i need to talk to you, too.  perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, professor tripp.
i do not believe i know where the upstairs guest room is.
well then. I would better show you. terry --
new?
walter just got it back from the framer today.
you go first.
all right. this morning --
I am pregnant.
I am sure.
well. this is... surprising. does walter...?
i think walter would find this a little more than surprising.
emily left me this morning.
she is left before...
she is left the room before. she always came back.
so. i guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? simple.
simple.
is that cristaile?
hm.
my god, i wear the same scent as a transvestite. she is a transvestite, isn't: she?
if she is not now, terry will make sure she is by the end of the evening.
has he asked to see the book yet?
yes.
and? are you going to tell him?
no. maybe. i do not know. i do not know what I am going to do.
neither do i.
sara, my arm. I am stuck, honey.
i guess you are going to have to chew it off then.
i could swear i had a '63 chateau latour in here. you have not seen it, have you?
i doubt I would recognize a '63 chateau latour if i was sitting on it.
you would recognize it if you tasted it.
i doubt it, darling.
well, q certainly will. and, given that he will be addressing 500 people in little over an hour...
you want to keep him happy.
if he is happy...  I am happy.
it was my mother's. she won it in a penny arcade in baltimore when she was in catholic school.
it is very convincing.
it used to shoot these little paper caps, but they do not make them anymore. the caps.
it is just... for good luck. some people carry rabbits' feet...
...you carry firearms.
are you and hannah seeing each other, james?
no! what gave you that idea?
relax, james. I am not her father. i just rent her a room.
she likes old movies like i do, that is all.  besides, she does not really know me. she thinks she does, but she doesn't. maybe it is because she is mormon and I am catholic.
maybe it is because she is beautiful and she knows it and try as she might to not let that screw her up, it is inevitable that it will in some way.
you are not like my other teachers, professor tripp.
you are not like my other students, james. so what was the movie you two saw?
huh? oh. son of fury. with tyrone power and frances farmer.
she went crazy, frances farmer.
so did gene tierney. she is in it too.
sounds like a good one.
it is not bad.
listen, james, about this afternoon. in workshop. I am sorry. i think i let things get a bit out of control.
they really hated it. i think they hated it more than any of the other ones.
well...
it does not matter. it only took me an hour to write.
really? that is remarkable.
i have trouble sleeping. while I am lying in bed i figure them out. the stories.
you cold, james?
a little.
so what are you doing out here?
it is colder in there.
you are right.
actually, i saw the greenhouse. so i thought... i thought I would come out here and take a look at it. you do not see one of those every day. it looks like heaven...
heaven?
i saw a movie once. part of it took place in heaven. everyone wore white and lived in crystal houses. like that. at least that is the way i remember it...
james.  do not leave just yet. there is something i think you ought to see.
I will miss my bus.
this is worth it.
are you riding with me, james?
no, I am going ho --
he is going with me. you take crabtree. and his friend. all right?
ail right. by the way, his friend...?
the answer's yes. i think. yes. i do not know. where are they exactly?
james. this is my editor, terry crabtree.
james'll know about george sanders.
george sanders?
mr. crabtree was saying how george sanders killed himself, only he could not remember how.
pills. august 25, 1972. in a costa brava hotel room.
there is so many...
just a few then. the big ones.
pier angeli, 1971 or '72, also pills. charles boyer, 1978, pills again. charles butterworth, 1946, i think. in a car. supposedly it was an accident, but, you know...  he was distraught. dorothy dandridge, she took pills in, like, 1965. albert dekker, 1968, he hung himself. he wrote his suicide note in lipstick on his stomach. alan ladd, '64, more pills, carole landis, pills again, i forget when. george reeves, superman on tv, shot himself. jean seberg, pills of course, 1979. everett sioane -- he was good -- pills. margaret sullavan, pills, lupe velez, a lot of pills. gig young. he shot himself and his wife in 1978. there are more but i do not know if you would have heard of them. ross alexander? clara blandick? maggie mcnamara? gia scaia?
i have not heard of half of those.
that is just how my brain works, i guess.
fascinating. listen, why do not you come out with us after the lecture. there is a place on the hill i always get trip to take me.
actually... i just want to go home.
oh, do not be silly. no one your age just wants to go home. besides, faculty will be present. just think of it as a field trip.
is that really it?
that is really it.
the one she wore on her wedding day?
so I am told.
go ahead.
really?
really.
they are glass. the buttons.
like the lady herself.
it is feels unreal, like butterfly wings or... something. it must have cost dr. gaskell a lot.
i guess. walter never tells sara the truth about how much he pays for these things.
you are really good friends with the chancellor, are not you?
pretty good. I am friends with dr. gaskell, too.
i guess you must be, if you know the combination to his closet and he does not mind your being here in their bedroom like this.
right.
I am sorry. professor tripp. maybe it is seeing that jacket that belonged to her. it just looks... really lonely. hanging there. in a closet. maybe I am just a little sad.
maybe. I am feeling a little sad myself tonight.
you mean, with your wife leaving you and all?  hannah mentioned something about it. about a note.
yes. well. it is complicated, james. i think we should go now.
shit, james. you shot dr. gaskell's dog.
i had to. did not i?
could not you have just pulled him off me?
no! he was crazy. i did not -- he looked -- i thought --
okay, okay. take it easy. do not freak out on me.
do you have a mirror? it is the best way to see if someone is breathing.
he is dead, james. believe me, i know a dead dog when i see one.
professor tripp? can i ask you a question?
yea, james.
what are we going to do with...
i do not know. I am still trying to figure out how to tell the chancellor i murdered her husband's dog.
you?
trust me, james, when the family pet's been assassinated, the owner does not want to hear one of her students was the triggerman.
does she want to hear it was one of her professors?
I have got tenure.
that is a big trunk. it fits a tuba, a suitcase, a dead dog, and a garment bag almost perfectly.
that is just what they used to say in the ads. come on, crabtree, i know you are holding...
whose tuba is that anyway?
miss sloviak's.
can i ask you something about her?
she is. ah. here we go...
oh. so. is -- is your friend crabtree -- is he -- gay?
most of the time he is, james. some of the time he isn't. now what do we have here?
looks like... our old friend mr. codeine. that should take the pinch out of my ankle.  have one.
no thanks. I am fine without them.
right. that is why you were standing in the chancellor's back yard twirling that little cap gun of yours tonight. you are fine, all right, you are fit as a fucking fiddle.
you had another one, did not you? you have to see a doctor, grady. first thing monday morning. all right?
is the thing -- is it over?
almost. want to sit up?  what is the matter?
nothing. i think i twisted my --
well...
don't. i know what you are going to say.
no, really, sara, i do not think you --
you love emily. i know that. and you need to stay with her.
i do not think i really have a choice in, that. emily left me.
she will come back. that is why I am going to... to not have this baby.
not have it.
no. there is no way. i mean, do not you think there is no way?
well, no, i do not see any way.  and i know how hard it is for you to -- to lose this chance.
no you don't. and fuck you for saying you do. and fuck you for "saying...  ...for saying there is just no way. because there could be a way, grady.
who is gun is that?
it is -- it is a souvenir. of baltimore.
heavy. smells like gunpowder.
caps.
pow.
you got me.
i love you, grady.
this is so embarrassing! you guys had to carry me out.
is he all right?
he is fine. he is narrating.
we are going to the men's room. only we might not make it in time.
i need a ride.
I am your man.
could not he have just thrown a shoe at the poor thing?
james is... i do not know...
disturbed. and when your friend crabtree gets done with him, he is going to be even more disturbed.
I am not sure that is possible.
sure it is.
listen, antonia --
tony. now that I am home.
tony. I am sorry if things did not work out so well for you tonight. with terry.
forget it. i should have known better. your friend is just, i do not know, into collecting weird tricks. mind?
he is writing his name in water.
what is that?
like most editors, he really wants to be a writer, but he is too busy living a novel to bother writing one.
that sounds like a fancy excuse for being a shit.
he would call it habit. but now... i get the feeling he is going through the motions a bit.
you mean because his career's ruined and all?
jesus. is that what he told you?
he said he has not had a success in ten years and everyone in new york thinks he is kind of a...
that is nice. all we have is a japanese beetle trap.
it is a bathtub. what she is standing under.
is that just beer?
primarily. although i gather you two staged a little raid on the crabtree pharmacopoeia. you missed a few bottles, by the way.
I am sure. where is everyone?
sara and walter declined. guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.
he has a book.
i know. he started it fall semester.
he finished it winter break.
so. is he any good?
no. not yet he isn't.
well, I am going to read it anyway.
come on. crabs. do not do this. he is one of my students, for christ sake. I am not even sure if he is --
he is. take my word for it.
i think it is more complicated than that. besides, he is a little... scattered. he almost... did something stupid tonight. at least, i think so. anyway, he does not need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.
on the contrary, it could be just the ticket.
no sexual confusion there, eh, professor?
shut up and drink.
he is a boxer. a flyweight.
huh uh. a jockey. his name's, um, curtis... curtis hardapple.
not curtis.
vernon, then. vernon hardapple. the scar's are from a -- from a horse. he fell during a race and got trampled.
and now he is addicted to painkillers.
he can not piss standing up anymore.
he lives with his mother.
and he had a younger brother who... was... a...
groom. named claudell. and his mother blames vernon for his death.
because... because...
that was good.
he heard everything we were saying.
I have been re-reading arsonist's daughter. it is so beautiful, grady. so natural. it is like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in style heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
i thank you.
and i love the inscription you wrote to me. only I am not quite the downy innocent you think i am.
i hope that is not true. we need all the downy innocents we can get.
so what are you going to do?
do?
i just mean, i -- i guess emily is not going to be there when you get home.
look, hannah. when you get him home... make sure he is all right. before you leave. okay?
i would if i knew where i was taking him.
hannah, are you telling me you do not know where james leer lives?
some apartment somewhere. but I have never seen it.
that strikes me as odd.
james is odd. i know he has an aunt in sewickley heights. i dropped him there once, but...  come to think of it, it was not even his aunt's house. he said she worked there. or something. i do not remember.
mmhmmm... knap... sap...
what is he saying?
his bag. you know that ratty green thing he is always carrying around. he must have left it inside.
hh-uh. last time i saw it was...
shit. he must have left it back at thaw. in the auditorium.
mmrrmmm... knap sap!
all right. take him to my place. he can crash on the sofa.
the one in your office? it is the best one for naps.
i do not think it really matters, hannah. we could probably stand him up in the garage with the snow shovels at this point.
you driving this car?
excuse me?
this 1966 maroon ford galaxie 500. you driving this car?
it is mine.
bullshit. it is mine, motherfucker.
you must be mistaken.
bullshit.
christ, crabs, what do you expect me to do? the kid's practically in a coma.
tripp.
yes.
hit your brakes.
what is this guy's problem?
just go around him.
shit.
back up. go out the other way.
wait here. I will be right back.
where would we go?
no. i guess you are here for the backpack.
oh... yeah.
is it good?
i do not know. it might be...
say, professor tripp, is all that stuff true about errol flynn? how he used to put coke on his dick. to make himself, you know, like, last longer?
christ, traxler. how the hell should i know?
well, jeez, you are reading his biography, are not you?
oh, right. yeah, that is true. he used to rub all kinds of things on it. paprika. ground lamb.
sick.
who is that guy?
her husband.
what exactly are we doing here, professor tripp?
taking the long way home.
thank you.
you are welcome.
I am okay. i just lost my balance.
i put you on the floor.
oh.
i thought you might -- i do not know -- swallow your tongue or something.  i guess you really miss her, huh?
huh? oh, no. this is not emily's. i just write in it.
i guess there is probably a story behind that.
there is, but it is not that interesting.
want me to get that?
sure.
he did not give his name.
who?
the guy on the phone.
what did he say?
he wanted to know if a grady tripp lived here and drove a dark maroon 1966 ford galaxie 500 with black interior.
what did you tell him?
yes.
good, james. if the zodiac killer calls, be sure to mention the back door pops open with a couple hard shakes to the right.
i thought maybe you would won a radio contest or something. is that single- spaced?
afraid so.
that is a big book you are writing.
i think it is sort of writing itself at this point.
wow, hannah always swore you were working, but --
but... ?
nothing, it is just that, well, it is been awhile since arsonist's daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
washed up?
blocked.
ah. i do not believe in writer's block.
professor tripp?
hm.
how did i get here last night?
no one seems to know where you live, james. hannah thought you would like my couch.
and... and before that. did i do anything? anything bad?
well, james, you did shoot the head of the english department's dog and steal his most prized piece of memorabilia.
well, there is always people you do not know at these things, but i can not say there was anybody particularly suspicious... wait. there was one guy. tiny fella. claimed to be a jockey.
a jockey? you mean, like --
horses, right. vernon something...  hardapple.
hardapple?
i could be wrong. what happened anyway?
huh? oh, someone pulled a b&e on dr. gaskell's closet. and the dog's missing.
that is weird.
we figure the perpetrator let him out. he is blind and we figure he just wandered off and got run over.
the perpetrator.
no, the dog.
just kidding.
one other thing. about this kid, this student of yours -- leer -- james leer. you would not know how i could get in touch with him, would you?
i might have his number on campus.
that is all right. we will find him.
i thought we were going to talk. last night.
oh. well. i...
hello?
grady, it is sara. thank god you are there. you will not believe what is happened.
could you hold on a minute, honey?
how is that?
well done, james.
i got kicked out. well, not exactly kicked out. i was asked to leave.
i guess there is probably a story behind that.
there is, but it is not that interesting.
so where have you been staying?
the bus station.
it is not so bad. i know the night janitor. and there is a broken locker i can put my stuff.
but james. i mean... how long?
a couple weeks. that is why... that is why i had the gun. for protection.
jesus, james, you should have told someone.
who?
i do not know...  me.
is not this...?
hm.
i can not help myself. i do not know what is the matter with me.
shit, james, you are hungover. what do you think's the matter with you?
i can not believe you hung up on me, you dick.
totally. I am sorry. a lot was happening this morning. can you talk?
walter's on campus, being the good soldier for wordfest. but he is a basket case. someone stole marilyn's jacket last night. and poe's missing, too.
i heard.
you heard? how?
a twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
did you confess?
your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
really? that was fast.
I am kidding. hello?
oh. right. ha. listen, about last night. there is something i need to tell...
are you limping? why are you limping?
hub? oh, well, that is part of what i need to...
did you pass out again, grady? did you fall somewhere?
no. i mean. well, actually, yes. sort of. i do not remember. listen, sara, i have to tell you something.
all right.
gee, grady, that sounded so heartfelt. i do not know whether to swoon or smirk.
really, sara, i...
i believe you. i believe you want to be with me. but this is not just about me anymore.
i know that. i know what is at stake here...
no, i do not think you do. and besides... i have not decided yet.
about the baby.
that... and you.
who is that sitting in your car?
james leer.
what is he doing out there?
I am sort of helping him work through some issues.
she seemed to take it pretty well.
yeah, well, actually...
do not be proud, james. we are in sewickley heights. we could find you a nice golf course to barf on.
no.
I have got a thing about, places like this. i know what those houses are like. i know what the people are like.
your aunt?
humboldt county?
maybe...
it is my father. he gets it from his doctor.
glaucoma?
colon cancer.
jesus, james. wow.
it is a bit of a scandal. my parents live in a small town.
where is that?
carvel.
carvel? where is carvel?
outside scranton.
i never heard of it.
it is a hellhole. three motels and a mannequin factory. my dad worked there for thirty-five years.
your father worked in a mannequin factory?
seitz plastics. that is where he met my mom. she was a fry cook in the cafeteria. before that, she would been a dancer.
what kind of dancer?
whatever kind they wanted her to be.
james leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper?
I am telling you what i was told by my uncle. and he should know. he ran half a dozen men's clubs in baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt.
did not you say your mom went to catholic school?
when we fall, we fall hard.
amazing.
i thought you were the guy who did not like to lose control of his emotions.
maybe i just needed the moment to present itself.
this is so nice. it is like where andy hardy would live. what is it called again?
kinship.
kinship. and what is here?
unless i miss my bet... my wife.
the one that left you?
that is right. that one.
someone jumped on your car with their butt...
how can you tell?
you can see the outline of a butt.
want one. they are incredible. incredible.
smoke the rest of that joint, james, and you can start on the box.
maybe she did not come here.
she came here. we will just wait. in the meantime, i need you to shimmy through.
relax. emily has not carried a house key since she was twelve years old. and your hips are as slim as hers.
it is not that. it just reminded me of -- you know -- of what is in the car. in the trunk.
oh. right. well, let's try not to think about that.
it feels really... good... here.
i know. it is the house you want to wake up in on christmas morning.  make yourself at home. I will be right back.
sara? hi. it is grady.
where are you, grady? an elevator?
I am in kinship. listen, sara, there is some things we need to talk about...
you are in kinship?
yes. but that is not why i called...
with emily?
what? no. there is no one here. I am just... just...
just what? doing a little dusting?
...reconcile with emily.
are you there to not reconcile with her?
goodbye, grady.
no. sara, you do not understand...
trust me, i understand. i just want to say something to you, grady.
yea?
how you choose to live your own life is your business. but you be careful with that boy, grady. with james. he belongs to somebody else.
yes. he is a good kid. maybe a little messed up.
well, I am sure with the proper guidance he will be fine.
what made you pull out that old thing?
i was thinking of you.
and?
it is no arsonist's daughter, but i guess you know that. it is a young man's book. it got me remembering how it felt to be young.
maybe i should read it.
oh, i do not think there is any danger of you aging prematurely, grady.
where is emily, hank?
i do not know if she would want me to tell you that, grady.
I am not going to stalk her. hank. i just... want to know where i stand.
where you stand?
i -- just want to say I am sorry.
she is in philadelphia seeing linda aahby. the neurologist.
neurologist? why? what is wrong?
nothing's wrong. they went to wellesley together.
oh. right. linda... i have not been doing a lot of sleeping lately. my editor's in town and i have the book to finish and --
ah, right. the book.
listen, hank, I am sorry about all this. i did not come here to upset you and irene. i want you to know that.
why did you come here, grady?
i -- just wanted to see her, i guess -- emily. and to see you too -- you and irene. and to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that is happening -- it is not forever. it does not mean "goodbye."
give me a break, grady.
i just wanted a little sip.
i just wanted a little sip? tell me, james, exactly what point was it that you turned into serpent boy?
probably about the time you gave me the codeine pills last night.
jesus...  look, james, you appear to possess -- like many an aspiring writer before you, by the way -- a rather ardent affinity for the stuff of which dreams are made. however, i think it is best if, for the moment at least  ...we abstain.
you are mad at me, are not you?
what?
you are mad because i shot your girlfriend's dog.
it was not her dog. it is her husband's --  who said anything about girlfriend?
okay, james, i wish you had not shot my girlfriend's dog. even though poe and i were not exactly what you would call simpatico, that is no reason for him to take two in the chest. still, the fact remains that I am the one who took you up into the chancellor's bedroom. I am the one who has to take the blame. i do not know what the hell i was thinking.
sure you do. you were thinking: 'that's no cap gun in that kid's overcoat.' you were thinking 'i can not let that kid get on the bus alone -- he might never get on the bus again.' you were thinking: 'i've got to find a way to distract this kid.' so you did. it was -- in its way -- a noble act.
thanks for the halo, james, but I have never done that much thinking ahead in my life -- ever.
so, why did you take me up there?
i do not know, james. i do not know why i do half the things i do. who does?  why do you wear that coat?
it is warm.
james, fall semester, first day of class, it was 95 degrees and you were wearing the coat.
that is why they all give you such a hard time in workshop.
because of my coat?
because you act like a goddamn spook all the time. not to mention the fact that every last one of them is jealous of you.
jealous? of me?
not you. your talent.
you are lying.
the hell i am.
yes you are. my stuff stinks. i know it. you said so yourself.
i never said that.
yes you did. last night. to your friend crabtree. "is he any good?" he said. and you said: "not yet he isn't." i heard you myself.
i did not mean it that way.
it is okay, professor tripp. carrie, howard, the others -- they are right. my stories are annoying. they go on and on and on, and the longer they go on the more annoying they become, until finally you just want to grab something heavy and --
shut up, james. you are annoying. carrie and howard do not know what the fuck they are talking about, okay? the entire class combined -- including the lovely hannah green -- has about one tenth of one percent the talent you have, okay?
but, last night...
who cares what i said last night, james i -- i was drunk, i was stoned. I would been bitten by a dog. my wife had left me. how 'bout cutting me some slack?
I am sorry.
and do not be so goddamn sensitive. who cares what anybody thinks anyway? you want to be a good writer? you want to be a great writer? then stop giving a damn what other people think. most of them have not thought in years.
let me spell it out for you, james. books do not mean anything. not to anybody. not anymore.
arsonist's daughter meant something.
you coming?
in a minute. get us a table.
want a bite?
no thanks.
that is why you are having them. your spells.
spells? jesus, james, you make it sound like we are in a tennessee williams play. i do not have spells.
what would you call them then?
i do not know... 'episodes.'
it is because you do not eat.
i eat.
when?
when nobody's looking.
you just worry about yourself, james. okay?
okay.
where you going?
nowhere. you just sit here and... eat.
I am not going with them.
james. listen. things -- things are a little weird with me right now and i -- well --i have enough blame to shoulder these days without having to take the blame if something bad happened to you. and if you hang around me long enough, something bad is going to happen, trust me. that is why i need you to go home. understand?
I am not going, with them.
james, like it or not, they are your parents.
parents? they are not my parents. they are my grandparents. my parents are dead.
i remember that. five or six years ago.
six. their plane went down right outside scranton.
near carvel?
I am sorry about all that. i just -- i do not like to talk about my family. they treat me like a freak.  she makes me sleep in the basement of my own house. it is mine. my parents left it to me.
get out of here.
that is why she hates me. that is why she makes me sleep in the basement.
in the crawl space, with the rats and the casks of amontillado. come on. up.
hey.
grady!
i know i should not have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and i could not resist and -- and -- i suck.
no, it is okay. i just can not believe i left it out in the open like that. crabtree has not been in here, has he? poking around?
i do not know -- maybe -- i do not think so.
listen, hannah. you do not remember where that aunt worked, do you? james' aunt.
he shot the chancellor's dog, did not he? the blind one.
actually, he is not the chancellor's -- what?
at first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon dr. gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
jesus.
crabtree said it sounded like something james would be messed up in.
crabtree? he does not even know james.
who does?
the aunt, hannah. where did you take james that day?
i told you, sewickly heights.
but where? i need the street.
i do not know, grady. i just dropped him on a corner.
tripp?!
shit.
listen, hannah, I am flattered, really, but right now i --
tripp, where the hell...
you stay there.
what? ohhhh. is that... it?
honestly, tripp. do you actually think i would sneak in here and read your book without asking you?
gee, i do not know, crabs. i do not seem to remember you actually asking me if you could invite 200 people over to trash my living room.
sometimes we have to improvise.
think, hannah. does james have any friends. i mean, besides you and... me?
james? my james? what is happened?
nothing, he is just been sort of, i do not know... kidnapped.
kidnapped? by who?
his parents.
good god. let's go rescue him.
good idea, crabs. only one problem. i do not know where they live.
ah. wait a minute. the university must know where he lives.
it is a little late to call admissions.
is it a little late to call the chancellor?
maybe... i do not know.
you know -- based on what I have read -- this is a very exciting piece of material, this big parade.
love. it is love parade -- and what do you mean 'based on what you have read'? you skimmed two chapters at 80 miles an hour while gargling methamphetamines.
I have been doing this a long time, tripp. i feel this kid in my bones.
only in your bones?
how bad is it for you?
bad enough. and god knows i do not exactly fit the new corporate profile.
which is?
competence.
so tell me about you and the chancellor.
what is to tell?
plenty, I am sure. but, for what it is worth...
jesus. there must be two dozen windows on that thing. how are we supposed to find his?
i told you. they keep him chained in the basement. come on.
hey. what are you guys doing here?
we are springing you, leer. get some pants on.
i like what you have done with it. when is captain nemo moving in?
the candelabras were my gran's.
oh, christ, do not start on old gran or we will leave you here.
hey, i heard all about it -- the parents, the grandparents, the china town thing -- and i believe you, okay? that is why we are here. now go get dressed.
can i -- i mean -- do you mind -- if i wear this again. professor tripp?
ah, wear whatever you want.
so modest.
so sensitive.
oh, come on, tripp. cut the kid some slack.
it is just ail that crap he spins out. just once I would like to know if the little bastard is telling the truth.
the truth. i know that is always been real important to you. okay, check this out...
you all right, professor tripp?
he is great. come on, let's blow before lo' gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
oh, well, that is just it. she is been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. if I am not here, she might... call the police or... something.
hhhuh. so we decoy her. stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she will not know the difference.
yeah. like in against all flags. only they use a couple big hams.
crabtree.
ye-es?
how are you -- is it joe?
jeff. sorry. i did not even know this was your house until about an hour ago.
do not sweat it. well. 'night, jeff.
oh, professor tripp? you know, last semester, what i said that time in office hours -- i hope there is no hard feelings.
no...
i mean, i was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- i was pretty bent in general.
it is cool, jeff. really.
i just want you to know that is why i dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo- faulknerian nobody.
walter?
yes?
who is this ?
it is grady, walter.
grady?
grady tripp. english department.
i know it is you, grady, i just... christ, grady, do you know what time it is?
i have... eight-fifteen. that is not right, is it?
it is three-thirty, grady.
this is important.
oh?
i... i...
what is it, grady?
I am in love with your wife.
excuse me?
sara. I am in love with her.
no.
nevertheless, I would like to see you in my office monday morning.
sara.
i tried to call, but apparently there is something wrong...
oh?
it seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
I am sorry, sara. I have been trying to tell you. it is all my --
I am not very happy with you right now, grady. but more importantly, walter's not very happy and he is gotten the police involved. they seem to think james leer is somehow responsible for all of this. you would not happen to know where james is, would you, grady?
inside.
and the jacket?
over there. in the backseat of the...
someone stole my car.
grady.
honestly. someone stole my car. i parked it right there last night.
are you sure you parked it there?
of course, I am sure. ah, christ, the puberty police are back.
is he awake?
I am afraid he is pretty worn out, poor kid.
nevertheless. there is a police officer standing on the porch and i do not think he is going away.
you snore.
so i hear.
no offense, professor tripp, but you look sorta crappy.
he is right, you look horrible.
it is the chancellor.
ah, right. well, i gave you my opinion.
and we both thank you for that, but we're... we're... fine.
I am fine, right. fit as a fucking fiddle.
shut up, james.
so what is the problem?
there is no problem. did i say there was a problem?
who do you think it is?
the chancellor's here? now?
evidently.  coming!
does she mean -- does she know about... her dog?
it is walter's dog and yes, she does know. but let's spare her the details. come on, your shoes are in the hail.
thank you.
you are welcome.
i want to publish this. I have got to. i think they will let me. with a little editorial guidance it could be brilliant.
great. between you and officer pupcik out there he can be the next jean genet. it is been awhile since somebody wrote a good book in jail.
do not worry, james, I will figure something out.
I am not worried. you are not worried, are you. professor tripp?
I am a little worried, james.
do not be. i do not care if they expel me. i probably should be expelled.
well, let's see if we can keep that from happening.
professor tripp...?
yes, james.
even if i end up going to jail....
this is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, grady.
would walter really press charges?
it is within the realm. he takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. and he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.
you did not happen to call the house last night, did you, grady?
i think i might have.
and what do you think you might have said?
i think i might have said i was in love with you.
he told you.
he told me.
and what did you say?
i said it did not sound like you.
so -- what do we do now?
find the jacket.
oh! huh. exactly how do we do that?
first i see if hannah will let me borrow her car.
it seems to me that girl would let you borrow her pancreas.
I will be... somewhere else.
hey, jeff. if you are really interested in discussing that business with the tango, try the guy at the end of the hall.
he cribbed that from borges.
it beats 'what's your major?'
right. anyway, i was wondering if i could borrow your car. mine's sort of out of commission.
sure. the keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
i uh, i did not finish, i... fell asleep.
that good, huh?
no, it is not that, it's...
it is just that, you know, i was thinking about how, in class, you are always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. and, do not get me wrong. I am not saying the book is not really great -- i mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and i do not know, maybe I am wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like...  ...you did not make any choices at all. and i was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you were not always... under the influence.
uh huh. well, thanks for the thought, but, as shocking as this may sound, I am not the first writer to sip a little weed. and furthermore, it might interest you to know that one book i wrote, as you say, 'under the influence,' happened to win a little something called the pen award which, by the way, i accepted 'under the influence.'
want some help with that?
do not touch it.
let me get this straight. jerry nathan owes you money. so, as collateral, he gives you his car.
only now I am starting to think the car was not exactly jerry's to give.
so whose car is it?
my guess -- vernon hardapple.
the hood jumper?
he said a few things that lead me to believe the car's his.
such as.
'that's my car, motherfucker.'
uh huh. so. we find vernon, we find the car. we find the car...
...we find the jacket.
there is only one problem, tripp. we do not know his real name. we just made it up. in fact, we made the whole guy up.
no wonder he screwed us over.
christ, tripp. how did you know?
call it a hunch.
vernon.
move away, cupcake. he is got a gun.
who is got a gun?
you have got a gun, motherfucker. drop it!
relax, vernon...
not true. you are the only vernon i know. actually, I am wrong. i once knew a vernon peabody at penguin u.k.
shut up.  cupcake. please. inside.
it is just a souvenir. they do not even make the caps anymore.
bullshit. i know a gun when i see one. and that is a gun.
no, really...
who the hell is that?
a manhattan book editor murdering a mormon girl's clutch.
naturally you have copies.
i have an alternate version of the first chapter.
you will be all right then. look at carlyle, when he lost his luggage.
that was maccaulay.
or hemingway, when hadley lost all those stories.
he was never able to reproduce them.
bad examples. look, tripp, i do not want to depreciate the loss here, but perhaps -- in a sense -- this --  is for the best.
kind of a sign, you are saying.
in a sense.
i do not think so. in my experience, signs are usually a lot more subtle.
let me get this straight. all that paper that went into the river. that was the only copy?
'fraid so.
and you are saying it is some kind of sign? what the fuck's the matter with you?
I will tell you the problem. you behind the wheel. there is your fucking problem.
that is pretty simplistic, do not you think?
hey, pal, you do not start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
excuse me. did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
he was trying to steal my car!
what he means is, it is difficult to distill the essence of a book sometimes. it lives in the mind.
yeah, but you got to know what it is about, right? i mean, if you did not know what it was about, why were you writing it?
hey, vernon. can i ask you a question?
shoot.
boy or girl?
as long as it looks like her, i do not care. you know what I am saying?
right. well, thanks. for the lift.
no sweat. only do me a favor?
sure.
stop calling me vernon.
the jacket, tripp. we need the jacket.
oh, right. oola. about that jacket...
came to my senses.
ah. well. congratulations. meanwhile, what is james supposed to do? pray for walter gaskell to come to his?
walter gaskell is not going to send james leer to jail, crabs. i know that.
do you know he will not expel him?
no. but i do not think that matters.
that is very enlightened, professor. it is comforting to know that america's children have you for a teacher.
me? what can i do?
gee, i do not know, crabs...  improvise. you are good at that.
you peeked, did not you?
i peeked.
yo, traxler.
hey, professor tripp.
do you get high, sam?
only when I am working.
holy shit. are you serious?
as a heart attack.
thanks -- whoa, professor tripp, careful here...
i passed out.
you did.
I have been doing that a lot lately.
so i hear. you have also been smoking a lot of marijuana, i understand.
do you think that is why I have been having these...  ...spells?
how long have you been having them?
the last month maybe.
how long have you been smoking marijuana?
spiro t. agnew was vice president, i believe.
that is probably not the problem, then. what about your lifestyle. any major changes recently?
I have been trying to finish a book...
and your wife left you.
is that in my chart?
i spoke with the woman who saved your life. you are lucky she came along when she did.
i know.
you need to see a doctor, mr. tripp. an internist. and i think you really ought to consider seeing a therapist, as well.
she told you about...
her dog, yes.
actually, it was her husband's dog...
look, mr. tripp. you have a drug problem, all right? on top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. we pumped you with antibiotics so you will be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. as for your spells. I am guessing they are a result of the anxiety you have been experiencing lately.
they are anxiety attacks? that is a little disappointing.
better luck next time.
so is my friend... is sara still here?
no. there is no one here.
i have to see her. as soon as possible.
I am so glad to see you, sara.
i believe you. did that nice doctor let you out? or is this you improvising again, grady?
I am through improvising.
terry told me about wonder boys. is it true? did you lose it all?
i lost it all.
oh, grady. you are such a putz.
i know.
and you are old.
ouch. how many?
dozens. it is very sad.
i went and looked at some babies just now.
oh?
i guess you have to go on faith.
some times...
did you tell walter?
i told walter.
does he still love you?
it did not come up.
did you just make that up?
in the hospital. i was kind of excited about it at the time, but then i was on pretty heavy painkillers.
you do not deserve me, you know.
i know, but sometimes...
