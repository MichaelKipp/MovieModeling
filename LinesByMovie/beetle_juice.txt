she is ready.
oh, adam, the model looks so good. the historical society will love it.  you have finished the streets?
almost.
manchurian tung oil?  where did you get it?
helen got it for me in oslo.
god... manchurian tung oil? there is enough to refinish the gateleg table and the cherry wardrobe!
yeah, i want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then I will help you.
oh, honey, I am so glad we are spending our vacation at home.
god, how i have looked forward to this, honey.
oh no.
it is your turn, darling.
hi, barb!  I am glad i caught you. i heard you were on vacation!
that is right, jane.  complete vacation.
honey -- today i am three hundred fifty thousand dollars!
no!  jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
look at me, think of me as cash! this offer is really real!  from a rich man in new york city who only saw a photograph!
jane, do not send photographs of our house around the country! we are not interested in selling.
you could double the size of your hardware store!  you will be rich.
and live in what, our station wagon?
barbara maitland, sweetie, you just listen now.  this house is too big.  it really ought to be for a couple with a family.
oh, honey... i did not mean anything ... it is just too big for you two. i know these things.
'bye, jane, I will see you in church in a couple weeks.
maybe i am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  i can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of new england.
no, jane.
you will be rich!
we are rich in what really matters.
adam my booyy!  when you are really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  my buyer has just made a killing in condos in the village.  and he is got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
so do i, jane.  I am on vacation.
does that mean you would consider it in two weeks?  you do not have to answer now.  he wants me to check the deed restriction anyway.  you take your vacation, adam.  say 'bye!
get away you little monster.
i will never sell this house. I will be buried in my yard next to barbara.  holding hands!  and a good paintbrush!
jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
ah, the ever-tactful jane.  let's just relax about having children.
we should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
i know... i just wish she would leave us alone.
let's not think about it.  we will have a nice romantic, quiet, vacation.  here comes the bridge chorus.
wave at the lion.
do not forget the balls, ernie.
adam!
adam, your bozman building is a beauty.
yeah it turned out okay.  we applied for a national historical plaque for it.  that will be the third one on main street.
you are doing it, adam.  you are saving this town.
slow down there, honey... i do not want the vibration to weaken the model.
oh... I am sorry...
this fire was not burning when we left the house.
how is your arm?
I am not sure.  it feels... frozen.
you would better sit down, hon.
i am sitting.
I will tell you what, barbara.  i do not think we survived that crash.
oh, adam.  we are home.  in our own house.  nonsense.  I will make some coffee.  you get some more firewood.
you saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
two hours.
what?
that is how long you were gone.
... hmmm?
anything happen while i was away?
yes it did.  yes it did.  i made a couple of small discoveries. here's one.
handbook for the recently diseased.
deceased.  i do not know where it came from.
look at the publisher.  handbook for the recently deceased press.
i do not think we survived the crash.
this is going to take some time.
i do not like situations like this. i hate it when I am not in control. so just tell me the basics.
this book is not arranged that way. what do you want to know?
there are a thousand things... why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  is this a punishment?  are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? and how long is this going to last?
i do not see anything about 'rewards and punishments' or 'heaven and hell.'  this book reads like stereo instructions!  listen to this... 'geographical and temporal perimeters... functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  this is going to take some time.
cabin fever, hon?
i can not clean anything.  the vacuum is out in the garage.  i can not leave the house.  why do not they tell us something?  where are all the other dead people in the world?  why is it just you and me?
maybe this is heaven.
in heaven there would not be dust on the wallpaper.
hon... i did not want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  as long as i never have to wash dishes again.
dishes?  we have not eaten in three weeks!  adam, I am not like you, i really need to be around people, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
but I am not hungry, are you?
god, it is jane butterfield!
what is she doing here?
i do not know.  jane, jane, up here!
she can not see you, right?  in the book, rule number two: the living usually will not see the dead.
won't?  or can't?
just says 'won't.'  wait a minute. here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they will never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
arrogant.  that is jane butterfield all right...
at least we will not have to worry about her.
i guess... if I am going to be dead, I will just have to be the best dead person ever!
that is my girl!
what do you think, honey?
delia hates it.
it is otho!
otho, why did not you just come in the door?
it is bad luck.  and i believe hugely in luck.
hold your breath and we will pull.
that was the single most unattractive window treatment i have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
I am so glad you could leave the city to consult me, otho.
yes, of course you are.  well, otho had an intuition.  call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  and it certainly is.  charles, you are lucky the yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what I am going to have to do to this place. we are talking from the ground ups'ville!
that is fine, otho.  just keep me out of it.  i am here to relax and clip coupons.  and goddamnit, i mean to do it.
is the rest of the house as bad as this?
the rest of the house is probably worse.  when can you and i get started?
no time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.
otho, that is terrible.
my sentiments exactly.  porcelain is for teeth!
adam, we are in hell.  i hate these people.
they make gypsies look good.
is this a punishment for something we did in life?  what can we do?
i do not know if there is anything we can do.
we are not completely helpless. I have been reading the book. there is a word for people in our predicament, honey.
what is wrong?
i thought i saw something.
okay?
you read my mind!  i love clients who can read my mind.  i do not think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
i know... i read your book, the haunted tapestries of the waldorf.
gooood!
what do you think?
viridian?
viridian?  what is...?
blue-green!  hydrated chromic oxide!  remember I am schooled in chemistry.  i was a hair analyst! briefly.  interior design is a science, delia!  think of me as doctor otho.  and this patient is truly sick!
of course, her favorite color! how beautiful!
oh my god!
i know!  we just have to pray that the other closets are bigger than this one.
otho, i cannot live with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
be brave!  otho take care!  onward!
is there much more of this torture?
that is charles' study.  but you do not have to even look in there. he will love whatever you do to it.  he is such a sheep.
oh, as long as we are here...
'i' will tell you what is boring.  once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place might just be livable.  what is on the third floor?
attic space.
let's see.  we could turn that into a media room.
you do not have a key?
maybe charles does.
i have a feeling there is some very interesting space behind this door.
probably the world's largest reader's digest collection!  c'mon, let's have some chablis, otho, I am laid bare by this experience.  entirely bare.
oh, honey, we may need that.
no, I am not putting up with this.
barbara, honey!  do not go out there.  you do not know --
whatever it is it can not be worse than this.
oh, adam, do not ever leave me alone.
you left me.
i know.  I am sorry.
we are trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
you can not say that for sure.  it could be a transitional thing. like a post-life crisis.  we just have to be tougher with them. come on.  have some brandy. spirits, get it?
death did not improve your sense of humor.
i can not believe that we are eating cantonese.  is there no szechuan up here?  hunan?
there is only one chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are irish and irish people happen to cook cantonese.  they do not know better.
i plan to have a stroke from the amount of msg that is in this food.
this is our first meal in this house, lydia.  why do not we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
lydia, relax.  we will build you a darkroom in the basement.
my whole life is a darkroom!  one ... big... dark... room.
yeah, maybe if he is nice, he will let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
lydia, we are the first trickle! in a couple of years this whole town will be filled with people like us.
we will be the art center of summer new york.  I will teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  and when otho and i get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
i say let's keep it the way it is.
lydia, at your age, you are so young.  charles, we need to call that awful jane butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  can not you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
we are going to have a lot to do tomorrow... the goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. should have it fumigated too.  i saw a fly today.
look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
not really...  what is this?
that is it?  no number, or instructions?
nothing.  the bio buster?  i do not get it...
well there is a little deetz at least.  boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, do not you?
what happened to the people who used to live here?
is this the key to the attic?
that is a skeleton key.  it will open any door in that house.  will you give it to your father?  and you might mention that i single-handedly decorated the house.  in case he needs advice in that area.  come see me.
are we going to be seeing you at miss shannon's boarding school?
yes, but I am going to live at home.
remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code.  I am sure you are going to be very happy there.
you jerks!  that is my art, and it is dangerous!  you think i want to die like that?  lydia.  moving is a family affair. so buckle down now and go get mommy some drugs.
any particular kind?
joke!  joke!  aspirin!  it does not matter what brand.
that little girl saw us.
she could not have.  we can not make them see us.
but she saw us.  i could feel it.
that is all we need.
where is your mother?
stepmother.  she is out torturing the movers.
lydia.  try to be civil.  I am going to see if i can set up a noise-free zone in the study.
i was just trying to open the door.  mrs. butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
let me have it.
skeleton keys never work.  anyway, this can wait.  we will get a crowbar later.  your mother...
stepmother.
... asked you for something, did not she?  I am going down to relax.  i want a noise-free zone. do you understand?  noise free.
what?
I am lonely.
there is nothing we can do.  it is just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  there goes my model.  there goes our last refuge.
we are not going to wait here like cornered animals.  i can tell you that.  we need help.  I am going to talk to that little girl.
what about this beetle guy?
we do not know who he is...  ... I am going to talk to that little girl.
are you crazy?  she can not hear you.
i do not know... what are you looking up?
we need some help.  i found something this morning.  here. emergencies.  'in case of emergency, draw door.'
draw door?  i do not know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
yet another triumph for adam and barbara in the afterlife.
wait.
darling, can not you see I am relaxing in here!
well i just wanted to tell you what i saw.
lydia.  what the hell is the point of my moving up here if you people will not let me relax?  go help your mother.
... not what i expected when we walked through that door.
no.  but it is somewhere without big worms.
you do not have an appointment, do you?
w... we did not know how to make one.
nine months?  what difference does that make?
good luck.  you are going to use up all your help vouchers.
help vouchers?
d-90's.  you spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one d-90 intercessions with juno. you probably have not even read through the manual completely yet.
wait for who?
for juno, your caseworker.  not that it matters to your type.  but there are all these other people here ahead of you.  I would say three hours.
my god, we are back where we started.
look at this, everything is different down here.  all our furniture is gone.
how long do you suppose we were waiting?
I would nearly given up on you.  i was about to leave.  i do have other clients.
are you juno, our case worker?
yes.  i evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
we need help.  we deserve help.
are you available?
no.  what is wrong?
we are very unhappy.
what do you expect?  you are dead.
we would like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  barbara and i worked very hard on this house.
we probably would not mind sharing the house with people who were --
-- like you used to be?
yes.
hell is other people.  you obviously do not read much. besides things seem pretty quiet here.  you should thank god you did not die in italy.  the deetzes.  okay.  have you been studying the manual?
we tried.
the intermediate interface chapter on haunting says it all.  get 'em out yourself.  it is your house. haunted houses do not come easy.
i heard.  tore your face right off!  bad news.  it obviously does not do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can not see you.
we have to start simpler, is that it?
start simply.  do what you know. use your talents.  practice.  we only help those who help themselves. just do a little at a time.  and of course, practice, practice, practice.  it is tricky but -- you were not murderers by any chance, were you?
no.
pity.  murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  just look at amityville.  he was one of my boys.  did not have to give that one any lessons. from day one... but i must be off ... I have got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
if... we have trouble.  what about the guy in the flyer?  betelge...
no.  you do not want his help.
no, you don't!  he does not work well with others.
what do you mean?  what is he do?
he is a freelance bio-exorcist. claims to get rid of the living. but he is a troublemaker.  he is pushy.  he is been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
our cemetery?
yeah.  he still tries popping up all over the place.  but he can not join the party unless you call on him.  get the deetzes out by yourselves! i got to go.
don't say his name!  just practice. do it yourself!
and if we need you again, how do we...?
that guy is in our cemetery.  oh, adam.
look, she is right.  we will just start simple, honey, be tougher. i feel... confident.  c'mon.
not a building!  that is the beauty of it.  i think i can buy the whole town.  these people do not know the value of their property!
then we own a whole town full of nowhere.
no, no, c'mon, max, you know me. I have got plans.  you got to come up here and see, then I will tell you about it.
just a minute, maxie.  somebody...
no listen... we will talk about this visiting later, i got to go, i got to meeting on the japanese joint venture.
great idea, maxie!  those japanese could run it for us.  build them a dormitory in the woods.  listen, think right about it, will you? we have almost got the house ready, you bring sarah with you and I will show you.
yeah yeah, we will think on it. 'bye ya, charles.  you relax up there, ya hear?
god, this is so corny.  have we been reduced to this?  sheets?
think of them as death shrouds. and the moaning is important. really moan!  practice, practice, practice.
i feel really stupid.
it is not stupid.  we are ghosts. do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  moan louder!
a... are you the guys who are hiding out in the attic?
we are ghosts.
are not you scared?
I am not scared of ralph lauren. those are sheets.  are you gross under there?  are you night of the living dead under there?  like all bloody veins and pus?
what?
night of the living dead?  it is this gross movie.
if i had seen a ghost at your age, i would have been frightened out of my wits.
you are not gross.  why were you wearing a sheet?
we are practicing.
you can actually see us?  without the sheets?
is this like a trick question?
tell the truth.
i always tell the truth.  of course i can see you.
nobody else can.
I am wearing contacts... also i read through handbook for the recently deceased.  it says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... i am strange and unusual.
why are you creeping around delia's bedroom?
we were trying to scare your mother.
stepmother.  I am very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
you did this?  you carved all these little figures and houses and things?
i certainly did.  I would finish it too, but... i do not get out much.
and this used to be your house, i bet.  why do you want to scare everybody?
we want to frighten you away.  so that you will move out.
you do not know the deetzes very well, do you?  my father bought this place.  he never walks away from equity.  why do not you leave?
we can't.  we have not left the house since the funeral.
funeral.  god, you guys really are dead!  what was it like?  the funeral. did you cry?
we were not there.  the handbook says funerals are not for the dead.
god, if this is true this is like, amazing!  i kinda like it up here. can i visit you sometimes?
well, i do not know... we do not get many visitors.
where are your skulls and bones?
you know you are really a pretty girl.
i do not wear that stuff to bed. besides, there is nothing wrong with it.  I am getting out of here.
wait... i do not think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we are up here.
you tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
wait a minute.  i had some licorice ice cream earlier.  you guys could be gas.  what if... I am dreaming. can you do any neat tricks to prove you are not gas?
dad.  do you believe me?
yes.  except when you creep around in your mother's --
stepmother's...
... sheets.
well this is... i mean, this is the weirdest --
lydia, i do not know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
this is not a joke!  that sheet was full of ghosts.
i can not believe you are doing this to me!  ghosts.  i am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  my agent, bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for architectural digest.  in fact, no one here tonight has not been in vanity fair.  except you.
i told them you were too mean to be afraid.
do not you dare talk to others about me.  I am an artist!  the only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of connecticut? not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
lydia's trying, but they do not believe her.
she is got photos, barbara.
adam, you had a photo of big foot!
this is different.  eventually she will take someone to the attic. and then what?  we have got to try to contact this guy betelmyer. we got to get some help, hon.
did you copy these gravestones right, adam?
of course i did.
then it should be here.
here's something.
i did not do that one... hmmm.
... yes this must be him.  look... betelgeuse... betelgeuse...
go ahead... third time's a charm.
betelgeuse!
what happened?
three times.  powerful number.
bet... el... geuse.  what an awful name.  i thought it was like -- you know.  the juice of beetles.
has anything been simple so far? from the look of the shovel, we dig.
oh, adam.  i do not have gloves.  my nails keep getting longer.  I will break them.
i guess we open it.
maybe we should knock first?
all right.  who are you?
we're...
you are the dead.
are not you dead?
hell no!  I am rolling.  I am a businessman.  I am the man what am. beeetel jooose!  who do i got to kill?
you do not kill anyone.
just get some people out of our house.
bio-busting.  i loves bio-busting. who do i gotta kill?  family -- right?  obnoxious i bet.  mommie, daddy, piglets.
just one daughter.
hey you've been on saturn!  i hate those sandworms!  yecchhh! I have lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  so a daughter?  she got good legs? god i love a young leg.
she is only fourteen...
... acts like she is thirty-five.
so you, the dead, want me, the undead, to throw the live guys -- mommie, daddy and lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
but... the deetzes are destroying our house.
you maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  so what is my cut?
can you scare them off?
honey.  let's go.
go?  what d'ya mean?  we need help.
no, we don't.  we can work something out ourselves.  we just have to try harder.
folks, be reasonable here.  I am at your service.  you be the judge. I am a harmless guy.  try me.
home.  home.  home!
honey, i think that was a mistake.
i am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
but we let him out.
i do not care, I have changed my mind.  ... i feel really confident.  we are getting better at this stuff.  we can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I have got an idea.  you are going to love it... I am going to hate it.
okay.  but that betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
hi ho, hi ho, it is off to work i go!
otho, you have got to help me get maxie dean up here.  i have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
he is a cloven-hooved beast!
he is your cousin.
i am ashamed to say he is.  look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, charles.  and sarah?  forget it.  you can not get her out of bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
do not you dare.
i saw some ghosts.
lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
it was not a joke.
tried to convince me that this house is haunted.  kids.  kids. kids!  i love them.
now, lydia... favor us about your ghosts.
no!  do not encourage this little... person.
oh, delia, lighten up!
she is been without therapy up here and i will not allow her to ruin...
and your sushi was remarkable.
the sushi?  i did the wine. did not you do the sushi?
n... no,  i just did the ink spots.
who did the sushi?
it does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in sheets!
we are dealing with tracy and hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  we must protect them, treat them with respect, nurture them.
they do not want to come down.
why not?
i think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you did not get scared --
of course we were not scared.  just a little startled.  one of those sushi dropped down my kamali.
all presences have a home space. a place where they live, so to speak.  where do they hide out?
the attic.
the attic room is locked --
they are ghosts.  they do what they want.
all right, you dead people!  come on out, or we will break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
shhhh.  they did not commit suicide.
it does not matter.  what matters is I have got a roomful of guests down there, who think I am a fraud.  i am going to teach you something here lydia.  you have got to take the right tone in things like this, or people -- whether they are dead or alive -- people will walk all over you.  come on out, or i will make death so miserable that you will wish you had never lived!
answer your mother.
listen, you guys.  these ghosts are really nice people.  i think we scared them off.  let's just leave them alone.  okay?
look at that detail!
look at the tiny figures.
look at all that parking!
come on.  leave their stuff alone.
lydia, i will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  you help us with these ghosts or you will be sorry.
I am sorry already.
now, let's get back to business. i want to get maxie dean and sarah up here immediately.  i can make history here!  I am going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
i cannot believe this.
delia will cook...
I will bring the wine... and the business plan.  and lydia you will bring the ghosts.
i can not bring the ghosts.  they are not here!
otho, could you actually... do something with them?
perhaps if i were properly motivated.
that is slavery and murder.  you do not know these people.  they are just like you and me.  they are nice people!
i hate you!  i can not trust anybody!
no, wait!
maybe they will leave now.  that snake was a pretty nasty customer.
he might have hurt somebody.
but he didn't.  we have got him where we want him.
i do not like charles deetz particularly, but you could have killed him.
hey, I have been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  i was out.  every dog has his day. this is my town.  i need a night to howl.
this is my town.
you wish!  i nearly scored with that little blonde.  i need me a short little queen.
adam!  why did you build a whorehouse?  have you ever been to...?
i did not --
the whorehouse was my idea. i want betelgeuse out of the picture!  we have got some serious talking to do.
about what?
you people have really screwed up!  i received word that you allowed yourselves to be photographed.  and you let betelgeuse out and did not put him back, and you let otho get ahold of the handbook.
handbook?  when...?
never trust the living!  we cannot have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
well, we did not know --
i feel like we have been at war, charles.
at least insofar as we have our first casualty.  me.
otho'll know what to do.
what is he going to do?  viciously rearrange their environment?
otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for max and sarah... because I have bought options on property all over town.  i need max's financing...
just do not tell lydia.
why not?
i think she is in with them.
mr. and mrs. maitland?  I have come for the last time.  where are you?  barb...
they are dead.
cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
of course they are dead.  they are ghosts.
no, i mean they have gone. decamped.  split.  vanished.
where did they go?
the happy hunting ground.  who cares?
are you a spirit too?
sort of.  high spirit.  heh heh. listen, cookie, I have been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  all i want is to get out.
i want to get in.
you do?  over here?  on my side?
i think so.
well, yes, of course.  it is great over here.  you will meet all the greats.  james dean.  buddy holly.  'the little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
well, it can not be any worse than my life here.
that is right.  they treat you like scum i bet?
yeah.
i can not help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  so simple.  say my name three times. that is all.  I will be all yours. then I will bring you over here in style.
i... i do not know what your name is.
minor problem.  the rules.  i can not tell it to you.  but... do you know how to play charades?
yes.
of course you do.
three syllables.
no, dummy.  two.
your fingers are so small i can not see them.  first word -- two syllables.
i do not know what that signal means.
it means look behind you, bimbo.
beetle!
good girrrl!
breakfast beetle?  beetle?  beetle fruit?  fruit bat?  fruit battle? volkswagen?  fruit wagon?
good thing you are beautiful, kid. you are dumb!
i am not!  beetle... juice?
that is it!
your name is beetle juice?  yecch! that is as bad as deeelia deeetz.
it is spelled different, but basically... now you said it twice; just one more time, and I will be free.  and then you'll be free.
god, you are anatomically correct!
just say it.
you were the snake!  right?  i know.  i saw you.
you have got to say it!
no i don't.  i do not take orders from smurfs.
how did you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  right now.  i can do it if i get out.
they would look silly on me.  I am fourteen years old!
how did you like to be married to... the king...?
yes... or no?  do you want the deetzes out or in?
out.
what about betelgeuse?
forget him.  he will remain with his whores until someone calls him.  you need to worry about people like otho.  there are a lot of phony trance mediums.  they usually can not make the formulas work, but if otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  as in -- exorcism.
you lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
I am so sorry we frightened you. what were you doing?
he said if i let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
no, lydia, we are dead.
i want to be dead too.
no you don't!  no... lydia... why?
life is just... too awful.
lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here.  you are going to be who you are... whether you are alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... it is flat... there is no food, no colors ... you can not smell the flowers.  if we knew then what we know now we would have been more careful...
... we would not have had our little accident.
so, never let beetle juice out. never.  besides...  we are thinking about letting everyone stay... you and your father and mother can stay too.
step... mother.
what is going on?
really.  i do not know.
they're... not here anymore.
nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
are they still here, otho?
oh, they are still here.  they are just not showing up.
they are probably guilty about what they did to me.
not these people!  they are ruthless!
i do not care from guilt.  i just want to see them.
otho, can you do it?
wait a minute!  what am i worried about?  otho, you can not even change a tire!
I will need something personal of theirs.
their wedding clothes.
their wedding clothes.
you know, I have been thinking.  i could teach lydia to sew.
little black party dresses?
ah, adam, you do not know anything about little girls.  she is just... missed out on some love, that is all...
let's see if she can get my model back.
you can build another one... with her.
we have been given a gift here, honey.  a real live little girl. she likes us a lot.  she needs us. maybe that is why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to things.  the house, antiques, your model.  look at us. we did not have room for anyone.
what makes you think she likes me?
adam!  adam!
as flies the lizard serpent fell; as goblin vizard, at the spell of pale wizard, sinks to hell; the buried, dead, and slain... rise again.
what is happening to them?
i do not know.
are they suffering?
they are already dead.  they can not feel a thing.
so... you are ready for me now?
you have got to help them.
can you help me?
... i will.
then i'll help them.  for a price.
w... what is it?

your qu...?  but you're...
I am beeyoo-teeful.
otho?
it is too late, charles.  I am sorry.
barbara?!!
now, let's get rolling!
what...?
just a hunch.
hellooo!  how is school?
it is okay.  how is the dirt business?
well, i just placed a call to your mother.  she had stepped out but i have some news for her.
what time is it?
3:30 i guess.
give or take a year.
did you get the paint?
i got it.  and i took pictures of the new church for you, too.
how did you do on the science test?
it was gross. they wanted me to dissect a frog. i told them no way.  i said it was against my religion.  i got a c.
we studied all day yesterday. do not tell me...
i got an a!
so can i?
uh-uh.  only if you got above a c on science.
oh puh-leeze!
oh, adam, do not tease her.  you never got an a in science in your life!
all right.
