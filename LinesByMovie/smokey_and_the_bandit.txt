-- breaker, this is banana peel...
-- yeah, breaker go head on.
-- thanks much. I would like to get me a smokey report?
-- road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
-- okey, doke. last one to the roadeo is a homo.
is that bandit in the lead?
if that sumbitch was in the race, he would be in the winner's circle by now.
i still think this whole idea is dumb, pop.
then it must be a helluva idea.
why do not we just rent a lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
because i wanna see this hot shot bandit do something that can not be done. besides, there is nothing i like better than breaking legends.
but if it can not be done, how is he going to do it?
that is the point, dickey.
oh.
now, you just find him, son.
yes, sir.
aw, am not you glad to see me, bandit?
yeah, it is the highlight of my day.
what is he get if he wins here?
if...?
five thou.
chickenshit money.
i can not believe there is two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.
america's bored.  now, what do you want?
you to forget this dumbass roadeo and take on a real challenge.
you are crazy, man. smart dresser, but crazy.
what is the matter? legend has it bandit larue's king of the road.
i can make it to texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours... that is no sweat.
it am not ever been done before, hot shit.
see, running coors beer east of texas is what bothers me. it makes me a bootlegger.
i hear a few weeks ago you smuggled sixteen beaners up to west virginia.
you know how rumors start.
i think you are just yellow.
wonderful psychology. why do not you say something about my mom?  excuse me.
look, you make this little run for me, I will buy you a new rig.
last year, this was a new rig.
but it was not a kenworth.
pop, a k-whopper's worth seventy thou.
seventy-two five.  why do you want this barley pop so bad?
he is thirsty.
i got a boy running in the peach tree classic tomorrow and when he wins, i wanna celebrate in style.
how much style?
four hundred cases worth.  well?
you paying for the gas?
cledus.
no.
wake up, man; i just got us a hot run for big bucks.
whadda we have to do -- kidnap the pope?
how did you know?
twenty-eight hours! you are outta your gord.
is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  look, it is only nine hundred miles each way.
that means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  forget it.
no one's ever done it before. this'll put us on the map.
or in the slammer.
did i tell you they are going to give us a brand new kenworth?
waynette!
believe me, man; fred'll be no problem.
yeah, i can tell he is going to be a major asset.
you know of course, we am not ever going to make it.
quit being so negative, guy; 'course we are going to make it. we am not never not made it, have we?
no.
see.
our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
and if we don't, they are going to be riding high in a brand new kenworth.
how long's this going to take?
i do not know, man. ask him?
we gotta let the slack out, cledus; this is costing us time.
if you ask me, i think we should make that run to choo choo town and pick up that load of lumber. nice. easy. and within the law.
also boring.
but i still do not think...
what are you doin' now?
running blocker.
all right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid smokey.
go.
now, if i say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
six. got it.
if i say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
twenty-one is nineteen.
if i say go to two, it is really one.
two is one.  listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. start in the basement. now, let's haul ass.
you are wall to wall and tree top tall.
I am going to run a couple miles ahead of you. keep both feet on the floor. we will be moving ninety and over.
bandit?
yeah?
why are we doing this?
because they said it could not be done.
loud and clear.
pull your hammer back, smokey's coming at you.
he is history.
okay, we got a straight shot to t town, so let her roll.
shit! no one's here.
that is 'cause we are damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
let's keep it that way.
liquid gold.
redneck heaven.
you know how to drive one of these things?
can a pig whistle?
hit the brakes!
they are jammed!
let's get the hell outta here.
should not we pay 'em for the damages?
right. give me your pen. we will tell 'em to bill kyle.
we still on schedule?
forty-two minutes ahead.
i hate to say i told you so.
save it. we got a long haul.
clear and rolling.
okay. i was in texas dancing in an industrial show for sunkist oranges. they say I am the new anita bryant. but I am really a dancer from new york. a lot of credits. moderate talent.  anyway, after opening night, i was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. a tall texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. pure dynamite.
all sound reasons for matrimony.
look, I am a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. besides, I am impulsive. it runs in the family. we are all crazy. mind if i smoke?  anyway, today was the 'bid day.' but as i was walking down the aisle, i realized this is total insanity. what am i going to do in texas the rest of my life? i can not marry jerry jeff. i mean, we are eventually going to have to talk. so, halfway down the aisle, i turned and split. you think I am nuts, right?
absolutely not. in fact, i picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
bandit i, do you copy?
this is bandit i, come back.
kate mcconnell.
kate mcconnell. sweet, shy... well- dressed. I am giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
listen, pardner; this am not no time to be getting laid.
believe me, that will not be a problem.
why are you driving so fast?
i gotta get back to atlanta in thirteen hours.
why? you have a bowling date?
cute. no, 'cause no one's ever made it from atlanta to texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
who would want to?
i never looked at it that way.  you ask a lot of questions.
why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
for a new kenworth. that is a truck.
a truck? you are doing this for a truck? that is insanity.
it is not a truck. it is the rolls royce of eighteen-wheelers.
but you could get killed, right?
hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
an existentialist.
a what?
eyes on the road.
so tell me about yourself.
okay.
well?...
whaddya want to know? my sign?
no. i want to know what you think about besides ditching smokey?
having fun.
is this fun?
driving?
driving, talking to me...
they are both a challenge.
you have a great profile.
yeah, i do. especially from that angle.
where you from?
mattoon, illinois. but i moved down south to work in the civil rights movement.
seriously?!?
would i lie to you?
guess what?
i give up.
you just passed your nemesis.
what the hell's going on?
i forget to tell you. I am running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
anything?
we are cool. the dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
can i ask you something?
shoot.
what do you want to be when you grow up?
this is bandit i. over.
where the hell are you?
smokey was on our tail. we had to take a detour to ditch the motherfu...
you can not swear on these.
what is going on, bandit? come on.
tell him we will be back on the highway in a second.
shut up, fred.
who is fred?
bandit ii. we will be back on the highway in a second. over.
I will keep my eyeballs peeled.
you know, you are not a bad driver.
you know, you are not a bad passenger.
this is bandit ii. now, where the hell are you?
on two lane blacktop. mile marker six-one. how we doin' on time?
thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
what is your twenty?
I am 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
not for long, you ain't.
breaker. breaker.
go breaker.
bandit, i just thought I would lay a smokey report on you.
go head on, breaker.
i would say your future's looking dim, boss.
what is your twenty and what is your handle?
my handle's smokey bear and i got you by the tail.
that is a texas cop. what the hell's he doing in arkansas?
i do not know. maybe jerry jeff sent the heat after us.
a texas bear in arkansas.  something is up and at this point in my life, i do not want to know what it is.
you know, my mother was a dancer, too. her big shot was the touring company of 'brigadoon.' she is been married three times. to a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  see, i motor-mouth when i get nervous. i was nervous when i first got into the car. now I am scared shitless.
believe me, there is nothing to be afraid of.
yeah, bandit ii, que pasa?
that is a texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
what is he...
what is a texas smokey doing in arkansas, man?
if i knew, cledus; I would be on college bowl.
well?
we lost him.
my handle's silver tongued devil and I am here to tell you, your fellow cb'ers are mighty proud of y'all.
thanks much, silver tongued devil.
your honeymoon would have never been this exciting.
i do not know. we were planning on seeing the astrodome.
christ, what channel are we on?...
eleven.
i hope that is you, buddy; 'cause I would hate to start believing in ghosts.
what does the old timex say?
she is losing minutes so you better start running interference or we are never going to make it. might i remind you this was your brainstorm.
I will drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.
bandit?
yeah, guy?
pick up a burger for fred. he is going crazy.
the bus'll pick you up over there.  uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
enough to get to jersey. I will walk the rest of the way. I have been sitting a long time.  nice meeting you. it is been a trip.
hey...
enjoy your kenworth.
what is your pleasure?
couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
no what?
nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I am waiting.
jesus!!!
trucker coffee. it is three times stronger. good for a hundred miles. that, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
order up!
that is me.
see ya, kate.
ciao.
sure i can not interest you in anything else?
another time.
what the hell are you doing?!?
he is after us again!
you know this guy, do not you?
I have never seen him before in my life. I am just trying to help you out.
by stealing my car?
i would have come back for you.
yeah.
yeah.
look, the truth is, i did not want to be dumped at the truck stop. i wanted to go on with you. i needed an excuse.
you could have asked.
you might have said no. i have trouble handling rejection.
where did you learn how to drive like this?
like what?
my vocal cords are fine, but fred's ain't. he is been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers.  hear that? where is his chow?
on its way. give me a coupla minutes, okay?
do i have a choice?
what is your twenty?
'bout fourteen miles this side of mississippi.
I am still trying to ditch this texas smokey. i do not know what the sucker wants.
what they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
as far as john law knows, I am just a joy ridin' georgia redneck. we keep 'em outta your backyard, we are cool.  now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I will meet you in ole miss.
if you don't, we can kiss that kenworth good-bye.
mississippi's the other way!
you want to lose this putz or not?!?
-- you know, i used to be a high fashion model. tried it for six months and almost freaked. makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
yeah, it is tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
uh-oh.
-- gimme a twenty, pardner.
I am at marker eight-five.
son-of-a-gun. me too.
I am kate. you must be cledus.
yes, ma'am.
how is your twenty?
i thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
i ran into complications.
i hate to say it...
then don't.
-- but everytime we have ever messed up, it is because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. i know you think you are god's gift to waitresses, but...
just do not worry about it.  how we doin' timewise?
not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
we are gone.
bandit?
let's hit it.
nice meeting you, cledus. keep on truckin'.
you plan on driving trucks all your life?
no, actually i was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
-- trucking am not the easiest life in the world. i mean, you can not make it much past fifty and you sure as shit do not get a gold watch when you hang it all up. but i like keeping on the move. you know?
do i know? I am an authority on it.
i guess if there is one lesson I have learned, it is that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target.  i forgot your question?
you plan on driving trucks all your life?
i... uh... i do not know. i guess do not like to think about it.
then let's change the subject.  what do you think about forced school busing?
an unmarked police car.
how do you know?
i know.  bandit two, bring yourself on in.
never mind. it is nothing.
anything else you do not want me to know?
nope. just keep those wheels churning.
I am sure the arkansas bears put out an all-points.
you take the front, I will take the back.
bandit two, i gotta make a quick pit stop.
now what?
we are outta motion lotion.
I will keep streaking. pick me up.
just the man who is going to see you driven to your knees! sheriff buell clayton from texas.
not that i do not have any respect for the law, but what is your problem, man?
you.
yeah, well i kinda figured that.
you know, you may think you are going to get away, but i promise you, everytime you turn around, I will be there, breathing down your neck.
well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, i got a lot to look forward to. adios.
-- looks like a clear shot to the 'bama state line.
I will believe it when i see it.
breaker. breaker.
pick it up, breaker.
thanks for the break. bandit, this here's the dixie chicken.
what is up, dixie chicken?
I am proud of you.
yeah?
you only smoked three cigarettes through the entire state of mississippi.
I am all ears, good buddy.
you are going to hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they are damp.
it should not last. gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
we will be waiting. over.
gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
you pass that funky cobra on the highway?
uh-uh. what cobra?
some boy named bandit's been givin' the highway patrol shit fits.
oh, yeah. good for him.
i do not know where he is goin' or what he is doin', but i sure hope to god he makes it.
kate...
ummm?
i been thinking. maybe i should drop you in montgomery. i mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to atlanta.
forget it. this is one of the longest relationships I have ever had. I am not blowing it now.
ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
you okay?
just fine. what is the weather like?
god's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
roger. keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down.  right, fred?
-- how we doing?
it is going to be close. real close.
-- actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named ramblin' bobby holt. when i turned twenty- one, i went to europe with visions of being free and independent. my luck, he was on the plane. i landed in paris and fell in love before i could claim my baggage.  we were together for almost a year. i thought he was it.
and?
he wasn't. one day i came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. and her sister.
my very words.
well, that is what you get for falling in love with a guy who is first name is ramblin'.
they should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
bandit ii?
talk to me.
we are going to have to do a little tightrope act.
let's boogie.
bandit two, you read me?
you are soundin' real bodacious. back.
-- it is hard to believe this schmuck kyle would go to such lengths for coors beer.
it is not the beer. he just wants to see me fail.
what kind of a guy is he?
the minute you see him, you will know.
what are you gonna do when you get home?
sleep for a week.  wanna join me?
breaker, breaker. this is bandit i, coming up on a portable gas station. do you copy?
bandit, this is mister b, and I am gearjamming this rolling refinery. you got another smokey on the rubber?
what else?  can you give me cover, mister b?
I am all ears.
you are about to hit a convoy. tighten up your rubber band. the oncoming's clear.
why are you stopping?
weight station.
bandit ii?
I am here.
you are coming up to the scale house.
I am cucumber cool.
bandit i, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
what is that, pardner?
do not take that foot off the hammer, 'cause you got wall-to-wall bears about to pour over you like maple syrup.
why should i?
because i need your help, sweet thing.  and i need it bad.
I am working, bandit. besides, what is the matter? will not your new girl friend help you?
hot pants, please. I am going to be flying by in about five minutes with smokey on my tail. can you lock it off behind me?
what do you want me to do, hot pants? beg?
yes.
I am begging.
i want you to know I am doing this against my better instincts.
but you will do it?
I will do it.
i owe you a big one, hot pants.
you sure do.
how is the clock, bandit ii.
ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to hot town. green lights and white lines all the way.
are you loco, pardner!?! we have come this far.
yeah, but...
when we agree to do a job, we do it. right?
but they are waiting for me. they do not even know cledus snow exists.
well, they are gonna. it is time this gearjammer rode to glory.  now, move aside; good buddy. I am coming through.
that crazy sumbitch made it.
congratulations. you just became a legend maker.
you got my barley pop?
what do you think?
have any trouble getting here?
about one to five years worth.
one to five?
maybe six months with good behavior.  one to five.
well, at least it has not been boring.
well, thanks for the lift.
hey...
what can i say?
promise me you will not fall in love with an inmate.
get your hands off my daughter!
your what?
he is just exhausted.
that man is your father?!?
i should have told you, but you would have thrown me out, right?
absolutely.
listen, he is nuts. i mean certifiable. but believe it or not, he once looked great in levis. that is why my mother married him. but like all good things...  i know what you are thinking.
what are you thinking?
you got to admire the man's determination.
see ya, bandit.
see ya, kate.
-- breaker, breaker. this is banana peel.
-- yeah, banana peel, go head on.
-- did ya hear they nailed the bandit?
-- yeah, i heard. but they will not hold him for long. anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
