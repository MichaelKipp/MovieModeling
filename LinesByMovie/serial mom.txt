who wants fruit salad?
i do, please.
that's not gum in your mouth, is it?
it's sugarless.
you know how i hate gum, misty. all that chomping and cheesing...
sorry, mom. thanks.  hey, chip, think i could get 50c for vanilla ice.
i wouldn't give ya a nickel.
carl can't believe how much i make at swap meets.
and who may i ask is carl?
just a boy. he's picking me up this morning.
here we go again.
he's really cute!
cute is not enough, misty. you know that.
she sure can pick 'em!
he goes to college with me!
leave her alone, chip.  i think it's great she has a new beau, beverly.
just a little, please. bad for the teeth.
always the dentist.
chip, honey?
thanks, mom.
look at this!  "hillside strangler gets his college degree in prison!"
that's nice.
nice?! he should have been executed!
he killed people, mom.
we all have bad nights.
you'd probably date him!  he's cu-uuute! hey, dad, did you ever see "henry, portrait of a serial killer?"
i certainly did not.
you've been working in that video shop too long.
and all that gore better hadn't be interfering with your schoolwork.
well, your mother's going to pta today.  we'll see what your teacher has to say.
aw, mom! i hate mr. stubbins!
i'm dr. eugene sutphin. what's the trouble, officer?
is there a killer loose?
hi!
jeeezzz!
det. bradford, i'm sorry but we don't allow gum chewing in this house.
sorry, ma'am.  we're investigating obscene phone calls and mail threats to a certain mrs. dottie hinkle.
i know dottie!
oh god, really!  this is the limit!
let me see!
sorry, son.  this is a matter for adults.
officers, i've never said the p-word out loud, much less written it down!
no woman would!
look officers! life doesn't have to be ugly.  see the little birdie? listen to his call.  peter pan! peter pan! peter pan!
chip, your ride is here.
hey, i'm late for work. bye, honey.
hello.
is this the cocksucker residence?
goddamn you! stop calling here!
isn't this 4215 pussy way?
you bitch!
let me check the zip - 212 fuck you?
the police are tracing your call right this minute.
well, dottie, how come they're not here then, fuck-face?
fuck you!
fuck you too, you rotten whore!!
i beg your pardon?
who is this?
mrs. wilson from the telephone company. i understand you're having problems with obscene calls.
yes, i am... i'm sorry mrs. wilson... it's driving me crazy... i've changed my number twice already... please help me!
what exactly does this sick individual say to you?
i can't say it out loud. i don't use bad language.
i know it's hard but we need the exact words.
alright, i'll try...  "cocksucker". that's what she calls me.
listen to your dirty mouth, you fucking whore!
goddamn you!
motherfucker!!
cocksucker!
beverly, are you alright?
rosemary, honey. good morning. i'm fine.  thanks for remembering.
it's the least i could do.  i heard shouting.
just the damn cable tv company. you know how they are. did you hear about dottie hinkle?
yes, i did. it's terrifying! the police were at my house this morning.
who on earth would want to harass poor dottie hinkle?
mrs... sutphin?
right here!
mrs. sutphin, i'm paul stubbins, chip's math teacher.
nice to meet you, mr. stubbins.  a little something i baked.
oooohh! a fruit cake. thank you, mrs. sutphin. have a seat.
bon appetit!
chip is off to a fine start this year.  focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
he's a good boy.
there is one big problem though.
what is it, mr. stubbins?
his unhealthy obsession with sick horror films.
he is assistant manager of a video shop...
that's no excuse for a morbid imagination. i caught him drawing this in class last week.  is there a problem at home?
certainly not!
divorce? an alcoholic relative?  tell me, did chip torture animals when he was young?
no, he did not! we are a loving supportive family, mr. stubbins.
well, you're doing something wrong, mrs. sutphin. i'd recommend therapy for your son.  thank you for taking the time to come to pta.
blood feast!
the "citizen kane" of gore movies.
i don't know what it is about today, but i feel great!
excuse me, mrs. sutphin.
hi, mom.
hi, mrs. sutphin.
you kids. now birdie, i want you to have a cookie and then run along home.
but mom, the video's not over.
no "but mom" for you, young man. mr. stubbins seems to think these silly movies are interfering with your studies.
oh, boy!
mom, mr. stubbins is a nimrod!
man, that one made me puke!
you forgot something...
are we leaving?
yes you are.
bye, mrs, sutphin.
bye, bird-brain. see ya, scotty.
bye, birdie.  chip, honey... i know it's hard being a teenager but i understand... i'm your mother and i love you.
oh mom...
can we watch that scene again? you know, where he rips out her heart?  pleeease?
ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
looks good, mom!
nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
misty, i made your favorite sesame broccoli...
yummy. carl says if i lose ten pounds, he'll take me to the university of maryland fall mixer.
misty, if you want to lose weight go ahead, but do it for yourself, not for some boy you barely know.
carl's a jerk!
he certainly drives like a jerk.
carl makes me happy and that threatens this family, doesn't it?
doesn't threaten me, honey. i'm happy.
i'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
i'm so happy i could shit.
chip! you know how much i hate the brown word!
did you hear?
what happened?
this is so cool! it's just like a horror movie.
that's like your car, beverly,
i'm not that bad a driver.  look at her hair!  turn it off, honey.
i can't believe mr. stubbins is dead.
you said you hated him.
well... he was an asshole... but he didn't deserve to die!
i can't stop thinking about that poor teacher.  goodnight, honey. don't read late, we've got a big day with the birds tomorrow.
i've identified every little birdie we're going to watch tomorrow on the eastern shore.
goodnight, honey.
don't i get a kiss?
i just thought with all the sadness... you wouldn't want...
we have to concentrate on life, eugene.
it's fine with me, beverly.  you want to, honey? you think the kids are asleep?
we can be real quiet...
i love that you're my wife.
you're not bad yourself, coo-coo bird...
you bring me such peace...
oohhhh, eugene!
shhhh..
oooohhhh.
don't wake the kids...
ooohhhh!
oooohhh! yeah! yeah!
you're hot tonight, honey... but be quiet! shhhh! the kids!
yeah! oohhhh! get it!
ooh, honey, i'm ready! now! now!
oohhhhh! yeah! yeah!
there's dede! he's my favorite chickadee! he's here every morning for breakfast.
well, honey, chickadees breed in alaska, you know. no wonder dede's hungry. it's a long trip all the way to baltimore.
i'm sorry, honey. but the birds will still be there next week.
it's ok, eugene. i understand... i'll go fix breakfast.
chip!!
god, mom!  what's the matter?
time to get up, that's all. you'll be late for work.
you scared me.
i'm stoodup! i'll kill that bastard!
don't say words unless you mean them, misty.
it's him!
no, honey, it's the police.  hello, officers.
contusions... fractures... rupture of numerous vital organs...
what a mess.
did you drive your car to the pta meeting yesterday, mrs. sutphin?
yes, i did.
detectives, what is this about?
i know this sounds weird, mr. sutphin, but the department of motor vehicle's computer shows only one blue station wagon registered to a parent of any of mr. stubbins' pupils.
surely you don't think beverly was involved!
she did it! aimed the car right at mr. stubbins and mowed him down!
from what i understand, the eye- witness is a drug user.
i got somebody you could run over, mother!
misty, that's a terrible thing to say!  detectives, it's time for you to leave. my wife knows nothing about this terrible... accident.
murder, honey.
now, here's a babe!
"p" as in...
...people who don't mind their own business.
just a half-a-cup.  hello, dottie. i'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
it's not fair!!
are those pussy-willows?
what did you just say?
pussy-willows, dottie!
dottie! watch what you're doing!
i didn't do it!
and we're going right to the flea market to get another one! misty tells me there's a whole booth of franklin mint stuff. dottie, you lock up.  i'll take care of poor rosemary!
but... but... she... rosemary, i heard her voice! it's her, i tell you, it's her!
what is it, officers? my patient is waiting.
dr. sutphin is your wife a big reader?
bird books mostly...
damn these yellow-jackets! i hate 'em!
always something isn't it?  can i help you?
young man, this faberge egg is chipped.
yes, ma'am, it is.
i'll give you fifty cents.
that's a franklin mint piece. eight dollars.
eight dollars?! franklin mint or not, it's damaged goods!
i'll take this instead.
nice one, huh? winter's coming.  three dollars?... i guess that's what i marked it...
did you find your franklin mint egg, rosemary darling?
i saw one, but it was ridiculously overpriced!
you want me to keep that under the table for you?
if you wouldn't mind...  it was on sale.
it's just not your day, is it rosemary?
watch the booth! i'll be back!
beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.
ewwww!  thank you, rosemary.
0h, that's horrible, honey.  i sold the pee-wee herman doll!!
mother! did you hear me?! someone murdered carl in the mensroom! i saw his dead body!
you got your wish.
but...  i didn't wish... i didn't want him dead!
i'm not kidding. carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
murdered?!!
yes murdered! you said you hated your teacher yesterday and he was murdered too. i don't know... maybe mom's nuts!
it's a cool idea, misty! let's make a gore movie about mom! better yet, a tv series!
how about mrs. ackerman? we both hate her!  should she be the next victim?
no! stop it! it's not funny. mom might do it!  someone else might die.
let's say grace and pray that we have the strength to understand the terrible tragedies of the last few days.
amen to that.  it's been a crazy day, hasn't it?!
she's gonna kill scotty!
both of you! get in the car!
dad! you don't think she did it??!
i do! mom's gone crazy!
turn right on timonioum road. hurry, dad!
if mom's a psycho, scotty will still be ok, won't he?
we hope so, son. and no matter what your mother is, we'll love her anyway.
suspect's family is headed east on calverton....
what was that?
i didn't hear anything. got any dessert?
dr. sutphin said no sweets for you.
what's he know?
how to send a bill!!
what is it, betty?
we have mice! i mean it, ralph! i saw one!
home sweet home! everything's fine, kids!
i can't believe i thought my own mother was a murderess!
beverly! not the sterners!
it's a shame. but they should brush their teeth, honey.
beverly, i've been reading all about it... is it menopause?
oh, honey!
tell me the truth, mom! it's ok with me, really! are you a serial killer?
chip, the only cereal i know about is rice krispies.
no comment!
"serial mom"?  wow!
hi, hank.
misty sutphin, get in this car!!
in here, mom...
but, chip...
get in, mom! i have to open.
this is so silly.
sorry, ma'am.
do you have the musical, "annie"?
sure do. did you bring back "ghost dad"?
there you go. i love bill cosby pictures.
mrs. jensen, i've told you. you have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
why?
because it's the rules!
i don't feel like rewinding it!
you see the sign! it's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time i'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99!
keep the change, you son of a psycho!
what a bitch!
it's the influence of all those family films.  right, mom?  hey, mom??...
mrs. sutphin?
mother?
0h, shit!
you don't think...
she wouldn't...
...jenner... jenson, emy lou jenson. 3511 clark avenue!
that's right up the street! come on! just in case!
i saw blood! and it's brown! not red like in horror movies, but brown!!
is mom... in there?
no!  it wasn't like gore movies at all!  it was real!
mrs. hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
i certainly did.
did you recognize the voice of the caller?
not at first, but then i heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and i put two and two together.
who's voice was it, dottie?
it was her! beverly sutphin! sittin' right there!  i'm lucky i'm not dead!!
mrs. hinkle... do you drink?
no, i don't.
so you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
i certainly was not!
you mean to tell me the day i came over to mrs. ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
one beer with lunch is hardly "drinking".
so you do drink?
socially... i'll have a beer.
so you admit you just lied?
objection! argumentative!
no i don't, you bitch!
did you see her?! she just said "fuck you" to me!
let the record show i'm just standing here.
fuck you too, you whore!
mrs. hinkle, are you insane?
no i'm not, you mother-fucker!
are you chip sutphin?
hold on...  yeah i am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
your mom killed my brother!
that's cool... hey look, you're carl's brother, right?
that's right.
i'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
you mean for tv or print?
tv, man! farrah fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
farrah fawcett?! who's gonna play my brother? is jason priestly available?
well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...it's called "chicks with dicks".
goddamn you! that's trespassing!
mrs. ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
...browsing.
did carl padgett buy something you wanted?
i didn't want that faberge egg - it was chipped!
carl padgett died for the franklin mint, didn't he?!
no! i could never hurt anyone!
that was your people magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
yes, but i lent it...
and those were your scissors found sticking out of mrs. sterner's stomach, weren't they?
yes... but... i didn't...
mrs. ackerman, do you recycle?
no...  i don't have room in my kitchen...
state your name, please.
marvin a. pickles.
were you in the men's room at the edmonson drive in flea market on saturday, september 19th?
yes, i was.
mr. pickle! did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
i... i'm not sure...  ...i... oohhh... excuse me...
what do you mean, you're not sure?!
ooohhhhhh! i made it all up! i never saw beverly sutphin in my life!
you'll pay for this, marvin a. pickles!  i'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  the prosecution rests, your honor.
bring her home... i guess.
no more violence... no more violence...
who wants fruit salad?
i do, please.
that's not gum in your mouth, is it?
it's sugarless.
you know how i hate gum, misty. all that chomping and cheesing...
sorry, mom. thanks.  hey, chip, think i could get 50c for vanilla ice.
i wouldn't give ya a nickel.
carl can't believe how much i make at swap meets.
and who may i ask is carl?
just a boy. he's picking me up this morning.
here we go again.
he's really cute!
cute is not enough, misty. you know that.
she sure can pick 'em!
he goes to college with me!
leave her alone, chip.  i think it's great she has a new beau, beverly.
just a little, please. bad for the teeth.
always the dentist.
chip, honey?
thanks, mom.
look at this!  "hillside strangler gets his college degree in prison!"

sorry, ma'am.
do you have the musical, "annie"?
sure do. did you bring back "ghost dad"?
there you go. i love bill cosby pictures.
mrs. jensen, i've told you. you have to rewind the tapes before returning them!
why?
because it's the rules!
i don't feel like rewinding it!
you see the sign! it's a dollar fine for not rewinding and this time i'm gonna charge you! $2.99 plus one dollar is $3.99!
keep the change, you son of a psycho!
what a bitch!
it's the influence of all those family films.  right, mom?  hey, mom??...
mrs. sutphin?
mother?
0h, shit!
you don't think...
she wouldn't...
...jenner... jenson, emy lou jenson. 3511 clark avenue!
that's right up the street! come on! just in case!
i saw blood! and it's brown! not red like in horror movies, but brown!!
is mom... in there?
no!  it wasn't like gore movies at all!  it was real!
mrs. hinkle, did you ever receive obscene telephone calls?
i certainly did.
did you recognize the voice of the caller?
not at first, but then i heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and i put two and two together.
who's voice was it, dottie?
it was her! beverly sutphin! sittin' right there!  i'm lucky i'm not dead!!
mrs. hinkle... do you drink?
no, i don't.
so you weren't drunk when you received those alleged obscene phonecalls?
i certainly was not!
you mean to tell me the day i came over to mrs. ackerman's... the day you claim you recognized my voice... you weren't drinking?
one beer with lunch is hardly "drinking".
so you do drink?
socially... i'll have a beer.
so you admit you just lied?
objection! argumentative!
no i don't, you bitch!
did you see her?! she just said "fuck you" to me!
let the record show i'm just standing here.
fuck you too, you whore!
mrs. hinkle, are you insane?
no i'm not, you mother-fucker!
are you chip sutphin?
hold on...  yeah i am, but you'll have to speak to my agent...
your mom killed my brother!
that's cool... hey look, you're carl's brother, right?
that's right.
i'm sorry he's dead, but... have you signed off yet?
you mean for tv or print?
tv, man! farrah fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
farrah fawcett?! who's gonna play my brother? is jason priestly available?
well, this magazine was found in your trash just last night...  ...it's called "chicks with dicks".
goddamn you! that's trespassing!
mrs. ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
...browsing.
did carl padgett buy something you wanted?
i didn't want that faberge egg - it was chipped!
carl padgett died for the franklin mint, didn't he?!
no! i could never hurt anyone!
that was your people magazine with the letters cut out, wasn't it?
yes, but i lent it...
and those were your scissors found sticking out of mrs. sterner's stomach, weren't they?
yes... but... i didn't...
mrs. ackerman, do you recycle?
no...  i don't have room in my kitchen...
state your name, please.
marvin a. pickles.
were you in the men's room at the edmonson drive in flea market on saturday, september 19th?
yes, i was.
mr. pickle! did you see anybody in the booth next to you?
i... i'm not sure...  ...i... oohhh... excuse me...
what do you mean, you're not sure?!
ooohhhhhh! i made it all up! i never saw beverly sutphin in my life!
you'll pay for this, marvin a. pickles!  i'm turning your file over to the vice-squad!!  the prosecution rests, your honor.
bring her home... i guess.
no more violence... no more violence...
