is there anything i can do for you, monsieur?
no, no.
yes, monsieur?
just looking around.
comrades, why should we lie to each other? it is wonderful.
let's be honest. have we anything like it in russia?
they tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? a maid comes in -- a french maid.
comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.
just a minute -- just a minute -- i have nothing against the idea but i still say let's go back to the hotel terminus. moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
where is your courage, comrade buljanoff?
are you the buljanoff who fought on the barricades? and now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
i do not want to go to siberia.
i do not want to go to the hotel terminus.
if lenin were alive he would say, "buljanoff, comrade, for once in your life you are in paris. do not be a fool. go in there and ring three times."
he would not say that. what he would say is "buljanoff, you can not afford to live in a cheap hotel. does not the prestige of the bolsheviks mean anything to you? do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all? phooey, buljanoff!"
this is comrade kopalski.
monsieur.
i am comrade buljanoff.
monsieur.
may i ask how much your rooms are?
well, gentlemen, I am afraid our rates are rather high.
why should you be afraid?
i might be able to accommodate you. is there some more luggage?
oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
I am afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
that is even better.
but, gentlemen, i am afraid...
now comrades, i warn you... if it gets out in moscow that we stay in the royal suite we will get into terrible trouble.
we will just say we had to take it on account of the safe. that is a perfect excuse. there was no other safe big enough.
hello, leon!
good morning, swana.
it is really a wretched morning... wretched. i can not get myself right. i wanted to look mellow and i look brittle. my face does not compose well... all highlights... how can i dim myself down, leon? suggest something. i am so bored with this face. i wish i had someone else's face. whose face would you have if you had your choice? oh, well, i guess one gets the face one deserves.
your conversation has one marvelous advantage, swana. however many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
do not you find that restful?... why did not you come last night?
darling, i was busy looking out for your interests.
did you win?
we can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! you remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? you will be in a position to give it to me.
oh, leon, you are so good to me.
we can be rich if you say the word. i had dinner with the guizots last night.
those newspaper people?
you would be surprised how many nice people dine with the guizots.
what a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
now listen, swana... i sold monsieur guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the gazette parisienne. "the life and loves of the grand duchess swana of russia"!
oh, leon!
sweetheart, we will not have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
was it for this that i refused to endorse dr. bertrand's mouthwash? i could have made a little fortune by saying that the vincent vacuum cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
i understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. they are willing to pay any price! they have a circulation of two million!
imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou! think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages! i can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments!
my little volga boatman! stop threatening! i do not deserve this.  are you my little volga boatman?
now, swana...
first tell me, are you my little volga boatman?
yes, I am your little volga boatman.
well... two million readers... i know exactly what they want. chapter one: "a childhood behind golden bars. lovely little princess plays with rasputin's beard."
I have got one chapter guizot thinks is terrific. "caviar and blood." swana escapes over the ice!
a couple of bloodhounds and we have uncle tom's cabin.
darling, this would be wonderful! just once... were not you attacked by a bolshevik?
was i? no... not by a bolshevik!
too bad! brings our price down ten thousand francs!
he is a waiter at the clarence, poor devil. you know him.
oh, yes.
tell him i will not be able to see him for a half an hour.
your highness.
how do you do, my friend.
your highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
what is it, rakonin? did you lose your job?
no, madame, something of the utmost importance... it concerns your jewels.
my jewels?!
i remember one birthday of his majesty, our beloved czar... i had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace... i still see you bending before his majesty... you wore your diadem and a necklace... your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.
why do you bring this up after so many years?
they are here!... your jewels!... here in paris!
alexis! do you know what you are saying?
this morning three soviet agents arrived. i overheard a telephone conversation with mercier, the jeweler. your highness, they are going to sell them!
did i hear something about jewels?
rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
i am sorry... i have to leave.
thank you so much, my friend. i will get in touch with you.
this is the duchess swana... i want to speak to monsieur cornillon... it is very important... please get him right away... hello, monsieur cornillon? the most incredible thing has happened! my jewels are here in paris! three bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! yes... yes... we must act immediately!... call the police... have them arrested!... well, then, get an injunction!... but do something, monsieur cornillon!  ...but they are my jewels! there must be some way of getting them back!
what does he say?
shhh!  ...but how can there be a question?... are you my lawyer or theirs?... all right, I will let you know!
what did he say?
it looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that is all... the french government has recognized soviet russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. he might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... that is all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
darling, calm down. why do you need a lawyer? have not you your little volga boatman?
capitalistic methods...
they accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
we can wait.
do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
he is cutting our throat...
but what can we do?... we have to accept.
comrades! comrades! do not let's give in so quickly. after all we have to uphold the prestige of russia.
all right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
we do not want to be disturbed.
my name is count d'algout. i telephoned.
if you want to see us you must come later.
i just want a word with monsieur mercier.
but you can't...
now, monsieur, you have no right...
just a moment.  i hope you have not closed this deal, monsieur mercier. it might bring you into serious difficulties.
you know, monsieur mercier, this is all non-sense.
these may have been the jewels of the duchess swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the state.
we can call our ambassador.
i give you my word! they were confiscated legally!
well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
get out of here!
do not look so gloomy, gentlemen. all is not lost. you may have a chance.
we may have a chance.
yes... a very slim one. i want to be fair. i do not deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
we have not anything to discuss with you. we will talk to a lawyer!
all right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I will talk to the judge!
that will not help you! you can not intimidate us!
soviet russia will put all its might behind this case.
you think because you represent the former duchess...
the duchess...
the former duchess!
in any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. i warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a french court, and when the duchess takes the stand...
all right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! what can she say?
but how will she look? the fashions this spring are very becoming to her. gentlemen, the judge will be french, the jury will be french, everybody in that courtroom will be french. have you ever seen a french court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? you sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
i suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
oh, no, no. i am not a highwayman, I am just a nuisance. all I am trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
what proposition?
i just said let's have a little lunch.  room service.
yes, leon...
what is it, my boy?
about this telegram to moscow. why should you bother? I will write it for you.
leon... leonitchka...  why are you so good to us?
leon, my little boy.
oh, leon, you are so good.
what is the name of that commissar on the board of trade?
razinin.
razinin, board of trade, moscow.
you would not like razinin.
he is a bad man. sends people to siberia!
we do not like razinin.
we like you, leon -- do not we like leon?
how does this strike you? commissar razinin, board of trade, moscow. unexpected situation here. duchess swana in paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. after long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. iranoff, buljanoff, and kopalski.
if we say that, leon... we will be sent to siberia!
and if we have to go to siberia...
I will send you a muff.
and how is lord lavenham?
...and little lady beatrice?
are we free, buljanoff?
possibly.
misha! misha!
what is it?
a telegram from moscow! it must have been here all day!
halt negotiations immediately. envoy extraordinary arrives thursday six ten with full power. your authority cancelled herewith. razinin.
it is thursday!
a special envoy is coming from moscow. he will occupy the royal suite. move our things to the smallest room you have got.
yes, monsieur.
right away... instantly!
this is a fine thing. maybe we have missed him already.
how can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
that must be the one!
yes, he looks like a comrade!
no, that is not him...
positively not!
i am looking for michael simonovitch iranoff.
i am michael simonovitch iranoff.
i am nina ivanovna yakushova, envoy extraordinary, acting under direct orders of comrade commissar razinin. present me to your colleagues.
comrade buljanoff...
comrade.
comrade kopalski...
comrade.
what a charming idea for moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.
if we had known we would have greeted you with flowers.
do not make an issue of my womanhood. we are here for work... all of us. let's not waste time. shall we go?
here, please...
what do you want?
may i have your bags, madame?
why?
he is a porter. he wants to carry them.
why?... why should you carry other people's bags?
well... that is my business, madame.
that is no business... that is a social injustice.
that depends on the tip.
allow me, comrade.
no, thank you.
how are things in moscow?
very good. the last mass trials were a great success. there are going to be fewer but better russians.
what is that?
it is a hat, comrade, a woman's hat.
this is the apartment we have reserved for you, comrade yakushova. i hope you like it.
which part of the room is mine?
how much does this cost?
two thousand francs.
a week?
a day.
do you know how much a cow costs, comrade iranoff?
a cow?
two thousand francs. if i stay here a week i will cost the russian people seven cows.  who am i to cost the russian people seven cows?
we had to take it on account of the safe.
for ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.
i am ashamed to put the picture of lenin in a room like this.  comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in moscow.
we did our best, comrade.
i hope so for your sake.  let us examine the case. what does the lawyer say?
which lawyer?
you did not get legal advice?
we did not want to get mixed up with lawyers. they are very expensive here. if you just say hello to a lawyer... well, there goes another cow.
we dealt directly with the representative of the grand duchess. i am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
i will not repeat your mistake. i will have no dealings with the grand duchess nor her representative.
comrade buljanoff...
yes, comrade?
do you spell buljanoff with one or two f's?
with two f's, if you please.
will you send me some cigarettes, please?  comrades, i am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the state.  you were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people. and you three comrades...
we did it with the best intentions...
we cannot feed the russian people on your intentions. fifty per cent to a so-called duchess!... half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! comrade kopalski, go at once to our embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in paris.
yes, comrade.
you, comrade iranoff, go to the public library and get me the section of the civil code on property.
is there anything i can do, comrade?
you might get me an accurate map of paris. i want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
yes, comrade.
you, please.
me?
yes. could you give me some information?
gladly.
how long do we have to wait here?
well -- until the policeman whistles again.
at what intervals does he whistle?
what?
how many minutes between the first and second whistle?
that is funny. it is interesting. i never gave it a thought before.
have you never been caught in a similar situation?
have i? do you know when i come to think about it it is staggering. if i add it all up i must have spent years waiting for signals. imagine! an important part of my life wasted between whistles.
in other words you do not know.
no.
thank you.
you are welcome.
can i help you?
you might hold this for me.
love to.
correct me if i am wrong... we are facing north, are not we?
facing north... I would hate to commit myself without my compass... pardon me... are you an explorer?
no... i am looking for the eiffel tower.
is that thing lost again?... listen... if you are interested in a view...
i am interested in the eiffel tower from a technical standpoint.
technical... i could not help you from that angle. you see, a real parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
how long does it take a man to land?
now, is not that too bad! the last time i jumped i forgot to clock it!  let me see... eiffel tower... your finger, please.
why do you need my finger?
bad manners to point with your own... here... the eiffel tower.
and where are we?
here... here we are... here you are and here i am... feel it?
i am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. must you flirt?
i do not have to but i find it natural.
suppress it.
I will try.
for my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
madame, it is that kind of approach which has made paris what it is.
you are very sure of yourself, are not you?
nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
i have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. it is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
a russian! i love russians! comrade... i have been fascinated by your five- year plan for the past fifteen years!
your type will soon be extinct.
the foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square...  i hope you will forgive me but i thought you'd...
go ahead.
four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the seine, and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side. the girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees...
that is a strange angle.
yes, very strange.
you gave me some very valuable information. thank you.
and thank you for getting me up here. I have never seen this before. beautiful, is not it?
yes, it is.
I am glad i saw it before becoming extinct.
do not misunderstand me. i do not hold your frivolity against you.  as basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. i feel sorry for you.
you must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... it glitters!
i do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.
what a city! there are the grands boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. the arc de triomphe... made to greet napoleon's army. the opera! and montmartre... montparnasse... la bohme... and now I will show you the greatest attraction!  it will cost me a franc but it is worth it.  the most wonderful spot in all paris -- unique! here, look....  what do you see?
i see a house that looks like any other house. what is remarkable about it?
it is not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. there are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
so that is your house?
well, let's say i live in it. such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
does that mean that you want me to go there?
please do not misunderstand me...
then you do not want me to go there.
now i did not say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
then why do not we go?  you might be an interesting subject of study.
i will do my best.
good evening, gaston.
good evening, monsieur.
is this what you call the "butler"?
yes.
good evening, comrade.  this man is horribly old. you should not make him work.
he takes good care of that.
he looks sad. do you whip him?
no, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
the day will come when you will be free. go to bed, little father. we want to be alone.
count d'algout, there have been several telephone...
go to bed.
well, may i offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
thank you. I have had all the calories necessary for today.
what do we do now?
we take off our hat and coat.  we sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. we adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. we look at each other. we smile.  well... we do not smile. how about some music?
is that customary?
it helps. it has ever since king david wooed bathsheba with the harp. as i am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, i shall turn on the radio.
i should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.
not too big and not too small. what I would call the typical room of an average man. or shall we say a little above average. now if there are any special aspects you wish to study i have nothing to conceal. just look around. that is my desk. those are my books, and here am i. where shall we begin?
i will start with you.
that is great. I am thirty-five years old. just over six feet tall. i weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
and what is your profession?
keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. that is a full-time job.
and what do you do for mankind?
for mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
you are something we do not have in russia.
thank you. thank you.
that is why i believe in the future of my country.
i begin to believe in it myself since I have met you. i still do not know what to make of it. it confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, ninotchka.
you pronounce it incorrectly. ni- notchka.
ni-notchka.
that is correct.
ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
your general appearance is not distasteful.
thank you.
look at me. the whites of your eyes are clear. your cornea is excellent.
your cornea is terrific. tell me -- you are so expert on things -- can it be that I am falling in love with you?
you are bringing in wrong values. love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. a lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
oh, i see. what do you use instead?
i acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
what can i possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
you do not have to do a thing. chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
you are the most improbable creature I have ever met in my life, ninotchka, ninotchka...
you repeat yourself.
I would like to say it a thousand times.
do not do it, please.
I am at a loss, ninotchka. you must forgive me if i appear a little old- fashioned. after all, I am just a poor bourgeois.
it is never too late to change. i used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. my father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but i preferred the bayonet.
the bayonet? did you really?
i was wounded before warsaw.
wounded? how?
i was a sergeant in the third cavalry brigade. would you like to see my wound?
I would love to.  tsk, tsk, tsk.
a polish lancer. i was sixteen.
poor ninotchka. poor, poor ninotchka.
do not pity me. pity the polish lancer. after all, I am alive.
what kind of a girl are you, anyway?
just what you see. a tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
you are the most adorable cog i ever saw in my life. ninotchka, cogitska, let me confess something. never did i dream i could feel like this toward a sergeant.
do you hear that?
it is twelve o'clock.
it is midnight. one half of paris is making love to the other half. look at the clock. one hand has met the other hand. they kiss. is not that wonderful?
that is the way a clock works. there is nothing wonderful about it. you merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
i can not possibly think of a better reason.
it is false sentimentality.
you analyze everything out of existence. you analyze me out of existence. i will not let you. love is not so simple. ninotchka, ninotchka, why do doves bill and coo? why do snails, coldest of all creatures, circle interminably around each other? why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates? why do flowers open their petals? oh, ninotchka, ninotchka, surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion... a general warmth in the palms of your hands... a strange heaviness in your limbs... a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing, more exalting, than thirst?
was that talkative?
no, that was restful. again.
thank you.
oh, my barbaric ninotchka. my impossible, unromantic, statistical...
glorious, analytical...
the telephone is ringing.
oh, let it ring.
but one of your friends may be in need of you. you must answer.
i must go.
ninotchka, or shall i say special envoy yakushova...
let's forget that we ever met.
i have a better suggestion. let's forget that the telephone ever rang. i never heard that you are yakushova... you are ninotchka... my ninotchka...
i was sent here by my country to fight you.
all right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! there is nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
as a representative of moscow...
tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
it is out of the question. if you wish to approach me...
you know i want to...
then do it through my lawyer!
ninotchka, you can not walk out like this... I am crazy about you, and i thought I would made an impression on you. you liked the white of my eye.
but, ninotchka, i held you in my arms. you kissed me!
i kissed the polish lancer too... before he died.
good morning, your highness.
good morning, gaston.
count d'algout is still asleep.
that is all right.
leon! what in heaven's name...!
huh?
is anything wrong? are you ill?
no.
do not tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
i just could not sleep. i got up and went back... and then got up again. these last few days... whew!
darling, you are taking my business affairs far too seriously. much as I would love to rob the bolsheviks of their filthy money, i will not do it at the expense of your health. particularly as we know we will not get much.  you look so pale... pale but interesting.
your breakfast, monsieur.
i do not feel like any breakfast.
nonsense. how can you fight the reds and make yourself agreeable to the whites if you do not keep up your strength.
shall i draw your bath, sir?
make it ice cold.
not in your condition.  make it tepid, gaston... tepid and tender. and lay out his gray suit.  afterwards I will drive you through the bois. slowly... in waltz time.
a blue shirt, perhaps?
blue? let's offset his mood. find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
very well, your highness.
now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? probably not. they have such unfeeling eyes. we will put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... darling, i have not seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!
oh, please, swana! i do not know whether I am standing on my head or my heels. here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I am trying to concentrate on another woman and can not get near her.
you have not seen her yet?
no, and believe me I have tried everything! i must have telephoned her a hundred times. I have sent her telegrams, I have sent her flowers... i asked her to dinner... i offered her seats for the opera...
that proletarian! in the old days we would have had her flogged.
that would not have done any good. not with her.  she is the most incredible creature I have ever seen.
you just told me you had not seen her.
well... er... i caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
imagine the carpets of a self- respecting parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! what does she look like?
you can not imagine.
that bad?  old or young?
timeless. when she comes into a room you would think that the bolsheviks had taken over paris. she wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by schiaparelli. what a woman! what a woman! there is a russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
you saw all that in one glimpse?
darling, if we are going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open!
now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let gaston shave you.
that is her.
imagine! the niece of the czar opening the door for us.
once in petersburg i was driving down the nevsky prospect in my cart and her highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction, and when i could not make way quick enough she spat in my face.
what is new?
leon, leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! she is going to fight that injunction. she is going to make a precedent of it!
she says she will not be intimidated by parasites. she called the duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
what did she say about me?
i think she covered you with the parasites.
and leonitchka! what she said about us...!
and they might believe her in moscow.
what do you mean they might -- they will!
we do not blame you, leon, but when we came from russia we believed in simplicity...
we avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we would not say no.
well, boys, I would like to help you but what can i do? yesterday i waited six hours in the lobby!
she does not leave her room! she has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
all right, then make an appointment with her so i can see her!
we can't... but you are so ingenious, leon...
you found your way to us and we were not easy to reach, were we?
no, no.
did not we put up a strong resistance?
oh, yes, yes.
you must help us, leon... if you do not win her over we are on our way to siberia!
or it might be the firing squad!
or we can not go back to russia!
yes! we could stay with leon!
leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
boys, boys... do not forget russia is your mother country. three sons walking out all at once... that is too much for any mother.
well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
room service speaking.
send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... what? there is a strike in the kitchen? good! will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. i hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... what? you will not serve me either? now look here, comrade, i think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you are weakening the people.
so! you want to make a strike breaker out of me! i am surprised at you, comrade! is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch? all i can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that royal suite!
where to, madame?
can you recommend a restaurant?
well, there is pruniers if you care for seafood. if you want to lunch in the bois, there's...
where do you eat?
at pre mathieu's.
where is that?
it is just a place for workmen.
where is it?
eight blocks down in the rue de poivrel.
this way, madame. are you alone? by the window perhaps?  or a nice little corner table?
this will do.
i think this is the first time you have been to my little place. your face is new to me. now, what shall it be?
raw carrots and beets.
oh, madame! this is a restaurant, not a meadow.
bring me something simple. i never think about food.
but, madame! if you do not think about food what do you think about?
the future of the common people.
that also is a question of food, madame. I will bring you a nice little lunch  la pre mathieu.
pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. you hurt his feelings. it was just like telling a musician you do not like music. that good old man believes in food as you believe in karl marx. you can not go around hurting people, comrade yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. do you know how?  by eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
i do not like your following me.
i did not follow you.
then how did you get here?
i always eat here.
this is a place for workmen.
but my dear child, i am most at home among working men. i hate the places where you circulate -- the hotel clarence... this is my natural element. after all, what are any of us? workingmen! at least, those of us who are worth our salt. hyah?
just an old man. his memory is getting weak.
what are you after?
must one always be after something?
your tactics are useless. my name is neither buljanoff, iranoff, nor kopalski.
oh, ninotchka, who wants to talk business. if you win the suit, fine. if we win the suit, better. you do me an injustice.  when we went to my apartment did i have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
but you have now, and i know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in russia would be punished by death.
death! death! always so glum! what about life, ninotchka! do russians never think of life? of the moment in which we are living? the only moment we really have? do not take it all so seriously, ninotchka. nothing is worth it. please... relax... i beg you, sergeant... smile!
what?
will you smile?
why?
just smile.
at what?
at anything. at the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. at people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. if you can not find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
why?
because we are an odd couple.
then you should go back to your table.
no, i can not leave you. i won't. not yet. not until I have made you laugh... at least once.
ha! ha! now go back.
that is not a laugh! i mean a laugh from the heart. now let's see. I am going to tell you a funny story. just a moment... I have got it! well, it seems there were a couple of frenchmen who went to america...
on which boat?
well, er... let's drop it. i do not think you would care for that one.
probably not.
do you like scotch stories?
i have never heard one.
two scotchmen met on the street... and i do not know the name of the street and it really does not matter. well, anyway, one's name was mcintosh and the other's was mcgillicuddy. mcintosh says to mcgillicuddy, "hello, mr. mcgillicuddy," and mcgillicuddy says to mcintosh, "hello, mr. mcintosh," and then mcintosh says to mcgillicuddy, "how is mrs. mcgillicuddy?" and then mcgillicuddy says to mcintosh, "how is mrs. mcintosh?"...
i wish they had never met.
so do i.  now, here's a great one... ha! ha! ha!  well, maybe it is not so good. let's forget it! how is this? two men are looking at the moon. one says to the other, "is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" "yes, it is," says the other, "five hundred million." "whew!" replies the first, "they must get pretty crowded when it is half moon!" ha! ha! ha!
i suppose you do not think that is funny?
no.
it seemed funny to me when i first heard it. maybe the trouble is not with the joke. maybe it is with you!
i do not think so.
maybe you have not any sense of humor. well, I will give you one more chance! now listen!
not funny, huh?
no.
so you do not think that is funny? it is funny! everyone else thinks so! maybe you did not get it.
I will tell you that joke again. a man comes into a restaurant. did you get that?
yes.
he sits down at the table and says to the waiter... did you get that too?
yes.
well, so far it is not funny, but wait. he says to the waiter, "waiter! bring me a cup of coffee." so the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "i'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."...  wait a minute... wait a minute... I am all mixed up...  a man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "waiter! get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "i'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"
I am sorry, gentlemen. the other day i heard such a funny story...  it still makes me laugh. it is very funny.  i am sorry. oh yes... about this injunction...
the hearing is set for the twentieth of this month.
that is two weeks from thursday...
we did our utmost to have it set ahead.
i know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the court. we are helpless, are not we?
yes. it is unfortunate.
well, there is nothing we can do about it. why get excited?
we will leave these papers here for your further consideration. au revoir, madame.
au revoir.
well, it means another two weeks in paris.
too bad we have to waste all that time.
i acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the power and light authorities. whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
oh yes, power and light. thank you.
there is something else which i know will appeal to you. a visit to the paris sewers. they tell me it is extremely instructive.
huh?... why do not you get a haircut, buljanoff? you all look so wintry, comrades. and why do we always keep the windows closed?  is not it amazing, at home there is still snow and ice and here... look at the birds. i always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. now i know why. we have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, comrades, i do not think i need you any more.
if there is anything we can do for you...
no, not a thing. would you like to go out?
thank you, comrade.
have you any money?
well, here are fifty francs.
thank you, comrade, thank you.
bring me forty-five back.
naturally, comrade.
what time have you, gaston?
eight forty-two, sir.
i guess it is eight forty-two.
you seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
i am, gaston.
if you will forgive me, ever since you met that bolshevik lady I have noticed a distinct change in you, sir.
have you?
decidedly. yesterday i was greatly amazed when i came from the market and found that you had made your bed, sir.
and gaston, i was happier all day long. i felt I would contributed something.
well, sir, if you should do it again, which i hope you won't, please remember the order. counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet.
ah, there is something poetic about the simple processes of labor. counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
may i add, sir, that it was with great amazement that i found a copy of karl marx's capital on your night table. that is a socialistic volume which i refuse to so much as dust, sir. i view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this bolshevik lady.
i can not follow you, gaston, is not it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? you being my servant? would not you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
no, sir.
is not there any revolt in you? sometimes when i order you around do not you feel like kicking me in the pants?
no, sir.
oh, you are a reactionary! do not you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "hey, you, d'algout! from now on it is going to be share and share alike"?
emphatically not, sir. the prospect terrifies me. now, do not misunderstand me, sir, i do not resent your not paying me for the past two months, but the thought that i should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me.
i do not look too foolish?
foolish? if this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself i would follow it from one end of paris to the other, and when i caught up with it i would say, "just a moment, you charming little dress, i want you to meet ninotchka... you two were meant for each other." ninotchka feels more comfortable.
you remember this room?
I have never been here before. i wonder whom you are thinking of. oh, i know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. today... now this might shock you... i went up to a taxi and said "eight rue du bois"... and here i am.
you see? life can be so simple.
for twelve francs, seventy-five.
twelve seventy-five from the clarence? the son-of-a-gun made a detour!...  but he got you here.
it is nine o'clock.
that is when one half of paris says to the other half, "what are your plans for this evening, madame?"
well, first i should like to take off my hat and jacket.  then could we have some music?
a wonderful idea! radio or records?
not radio. let's have music that is just for ourselves.
you see i could not shout that.
leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? i wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. now, leon that is wrong. i know they are not funny, they are silly. they are stupid. and still... i laugh... and when i look at buljanoff and iranoff and kopalski i know they are scoundrels and i should hate them -- then i realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to moscow i tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am i too talkative?
no... go on.
leon, i want to tell you something which i thought i never would say, which i thought nobody ever should say, because i thought it did not exist... and, leon... i can not say it...
leon, i would like to ask you something.
anything, ninotchka.
if you do not want to answer, you needn't. but if you do, you must tell me the truth.
i promise... i swear.
did you make any change in this room?
i do not think so.
when i was here before i noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. i thought what a waste of silver. that is all that interested me then. now i would like to know... what happened to the woman?
she is very attractive. she has great elegance.  she is what you call a woman of the world, is not she?
ninotchka, i love you.
i suppose she is very entertaining... it must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
ninotchka, you are jealous.
leon, do not ever ask me for a picture of myself... i could not bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... i could not breathe, i could not stand it.
my darling.
good evening, your highness.
good evening, louis. you seem to be very crowded tonight. can you manage a table near the floor?
certainly, your highness, this way please... count d'algout made the reservation this afternoon.
count d'algout...
it is only a small table but it will be no trouble to put in some extra chairs.
only one in the rear, I am afraid.
that is perfect!
is this satisfactory?
thank you, louis.
your highness...
yes, general savitzky?
i want you to know all the white russian exiles in paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. they are very interested in the case. swana suspects her countrymen.
are they indeed? thank you.
they hope the settlement will bring you a fortune.
general, please... if you hear any rumors that i am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?
i would not know. the closest i ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. the wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
it is always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
it is funny to look back. i was brought up on goat's milk, i had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
from goats to grapes. that is drinking in the right direction.
from what i read i thought champagne was a strong drink. it is very delicate. do people ever get drunk on this?
there have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast.  to us, ninotchka!
you are looking magnificent, leon...  ...isn't he, general savitzky?
yes.
thank you.
is this your new dress suit?
yes, swana.
did not i tell you benson and benson were the tailors for you?
yes, swana, you did.
it is a dream of beauty. he never takes my word for anything, but i was right, was not i?
yes, swana.
am i interrupting?
not at all. your highness, may i present madame yakushova?
how do you do?
how do you do?
and general savitzky.
I have some wonderful news for you, leon. it is about punchy... do you mind if i sit down?
no... please...
general, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I will be back in a few moments.
certainly.
he won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. ha! ha! ha! i bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. you should see him strut down the street in it. he looks like a little boulevardier.  you see, count d'algout gave me punchy for my birthday.  you must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as punchy, did not you, leon?
months, swana.
poor madame yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I am sure you wonder what it is all about.
not at all.... i understand perfectly, count d'algout gave you a dog. you made it very clear, madame.
dear me... i must be losing my finesse. if I am not careful I will be understood by everybody.
there is a charming crowd here tonight, is not there?
I am going, leon...  but before i leave i must compliment you on your gown, madame yakushova. is that what they are wearing in moscow this year?
is not it amazing! one gets a wrong impression of the new russia.  it must be charming. I am glad conditions are so improved. i assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
exactly. you see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old russia. the lashes of the cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
you are absolutely right about the cossacks. we made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts. they had such reliable guns.
will you do me a favor? stop talking about the good old days.
a very wise suggestion, leon. I am afraid madame and i will never agree.  the only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. i understand everything will be over by thursday. am i right?
you are right, madame, it will all be over by thursday.
it is unfortunate that you have so few more days in paris.  be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to moscow.  good night.  good night, leon.
quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
a funny story?
you never finished the one about the two scotchmen with the names.
well, there were two scotchmen. one was named mcintosh and one was named mcgillicuddy. they met on the street.
go on.
no, darling. I will tell you another story, a much better one.  the only thing that will be over on thursday is the lawsuit. there will be no thursday for us. not next week or any week. we will not let it happen. I will tear it out of the calendar. is that a good story?
wonderful -- if one could believe it.
you must, darling.
to the loveliest story i ever heard.
oo! darling! something is the matter.
you just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
oh, everything is so wonderful! it is getting farther and farther away!
what, darling?
thursday.
yes. do not worry. everything will be all right.
comrades! comrades!
darling, darling... please!
i must talk to my brothers!
shhh! shhh!
do not shush me. i am people! i want to make a speech. i want to overthrow the duchess!
but, darling, you can not do that.
comrades! good people of france!
now, ninotchka... please!
they are all duchesses here... thousands of duchesses... and i am going to tell them.
quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you are going in that door and you are going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
no speech?
no speech.
i love you, my little leonitchka!
and i adore you, ninotchua.
give me another double brandy.
that kind of propaganda is bad anywhere, but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike.... well, if she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.
what can i do about it?
she has been asked to leave the powder room but without success. we would appreciate if you would see to it yourself.
you want me to go in there?
I am sorry, sir, but i must insist.
do not tell them where we are going, sweetheart.
no. nobody will find us.
are we going to build our little house?
yes... a little white house.
not white, darling.
all right, we will make it red.
no, do not let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
right: lovers of the world unite!
and we will not stretch up our arms...
no! no!
...and we will not clench our fist...
no! no!
our salute will be a kiss.
yes... a kiss... salute!
i am so happy. no one can be so happy without being punished. i will be punished and i should be punished.  i want to confess, darling.
i know... it is the russian soul.
everyone wants to confess and if they do not confess they make them confess. i am a traitor. when i kissed you i betrayed the russian ideal. leon, i should be stood up against the wall.
would that make you any happier?
much happier.
all right.
i have paid the penalty. now let's have some music.
let's turn on the radio.
radio! what is radio?
it is a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
oh yes, yes. it has a little knob that turns... a little knob... it must be somewhere around here... yes... here... i see...
what shall we get? the news!
no, no news. we do not want to know what is happening in the world. we want to be left alone, do not we?
yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
it is dead.
well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!
no music.
no, no music.
there it is... thursday... you can not rip it out of the week....
but i can throw it out of the window.
it would not be fair to the man in the street.  there they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
...but big.
...they are the tears of old russia... see that stone?
who cried that one?
czar peter gave it to his wife, catherine the great. for it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
now, darling, do not get impatient, wait until we are married. you know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? some day when i come home to you i may say, "darling, i drove gaston to the market and look what i got from him!"
come, sweetheart. let me put it on you. you will teach these jewels. for the first time they will learn how they can look.
they belong to the people.
i give them back to the people...  i make you ninotchka the great... duchess of the people!... grand duchess of the people!
is this the wish of the masses?
it is their wish.
thank you, leon... thank you, masses.  can i make a speech now?
please.
comrades! people of the world! the revolution is on the march... i know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what is the hurry?  let us be happy... give us our moment....  we are happy, are not we, leon?
yes, sweetheart.
so happy and so tired.
good morning.
what?
it is tomorrow morning... tomorrow noon, to be exact. i hope you will forgive me. i know it is extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour. do not you recognize me? i am the duchess swana.
i think we can cut your visit short. leon is not here.
of course not, my dear! i did not come here with any such suspicion. how ridiculous!  nor did i come here to pick up his hat.
how stale last night's gaiety looks! it has the taste of a dead cigarette.
if you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night i am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
do not worry, you were quite rude enough.  do you mind if i let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I am sure it will make you feel better and i want you to be at your very best. in full possession of your faculties, at least.
please come to the point. what is it you want?
i just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
we have nothing to discuss.
now there you are completely wrong. if we sit down for a little chat, I am sure we will not run out of conversation and what is more it will not be dull.
madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "i am delighted to have you here"? i have not reached that stage of civilization.
that is all right... i grow on people.
i must ask you to leave.
leave? that is exactly what i came here to ask you to do. leave! i do not mean this hotel and i do not mean paris... i mean france. there is a plane for moscow at five-forty.
madame, if you...
do not worry. i have already made reservations. it is perfect flying weather. they assure me there is a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to moscow in no time.
if this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. or do you still think you are issuing orders from your palace in petrograd?
my palace in petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. you took away my czar, my country, my people, everything i had...  but nothing more -- i warn you.
people cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. not if you have their love. you hadn't. that is why you are not in russia any longer, and that is why you came here this morning.
very interesting, my dear, but could not you write all that from moscow? a dissertation on love on soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
it is not enough to be witty, madame. people grow tired of being entertained. you made that mistake before. problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
my dear, you do not know how impressive i could be. did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?
you can not deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling romanoffs -- eight!
i must insist that you leave.
not before you agree to use those reservations to moscow.
in that case i can only say good-by.
i would not waken leon. after last night i would say not before three of the clock at the earliest.
i told you to go, madame.
believe me, leon can not help you. he does not know anything about the jewels... i give you my word... i swear it.
where are they?
you were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. they are too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
where are they?
do not worry. fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a russian.  i just put this on for sentiment. the rest are absolutely safe. i assure you. but if you feel like notifying the police...
you leave me no choice.
will not it be rather embarrassing for a soviet envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
i will have to face the consequences, but so will you. do not forget they will ask how you got them.
that is very simple to answer. they were given to me by my mother. they were given to her by her mother, in fact they are mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!
they always belonged to the russian people. they were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
i told you we had plenty to talk about. shall we sit down?
now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. our situation has changed considerably. before i had only a claim to the jewels. now i have the jewels.
in other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. you know that france has recognized the soviet.
unfortunately.
under soviet law the jewels belong to the state. france is going to uphold that ownership.
my lawyer agrees with you. he says france will uphold it in every court, but i will drag you through every court, do not forget that. and when i say it will take two years i am, as always, conservative.
will not those two years in court be expensive for you? i know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
i may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
i see. you have calculated in terms of hunger.
no, i just wanted to be absolutely impartial. both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. we can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
go on.
i am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to moscow.
that is not the way to win him back... not leon.
i think i know leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. leave that worry to me. five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with monsieur mercier, but naturally you will be too busy for any farewells. I will see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and i will also see you to the airport. that is my proposition, comrade yakushova.
leon, darling, how nice! have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
no thanks, swana.
did i act stupidly last night? should i apologize?
I am the one who should apologize. i should have talked to you before.
is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
yes.
oh, no, my little volga boatman. have you forgotten our first commandment: never complain -- never explain. it has worked so often and so perfectly, do not let's break the rule. and please do not look so guilty, otherwise i'll...
this time, swana -- just this once -- i must ask you to listen.
all right, I will listen.
i know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I am not in the least subtle?
brutal frankness, if you insist.
there are a hundred ways to approach it, but i feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I am in love, swana.
and i thought it was something serious! how could you frighten me so?
it must be serious, swana. not long ago I would have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. now i can say it without stammering, without a blush. I am in love, swana.
say it over and over again, leon. words are a wonderful safety valve, and that is what you need -- because you know it is impossible, do not you?
i have to be simple again, swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I have thought it over and I am willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
leon! this has the ugly sound of regeneration.
I am afraid that is what it is.
the same old trouble, leon. you are always late. whether you are taking me to the opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you are never on time. and now, when it is a question of your reform -- late again.  by about five minutes.
what is this, swana?
knowing the efficiency of the french air service i think i can guarantee that madame yakushova has already taken off for moscow.
has done what?
she is gone, leon.
do you expect me to believe that?
imagine, for once in our lives we were in paris and we never went to the eiffel tower.
that is right.
they tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
while you eat, you look at the view.
pardon me, i am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to russia -- if they do not like what he has done they put him out of the way?
not always... look at me... I have been back twice.
here's my passport.... please give me a visa. i have to leave for russia immediately.
count leon d'algout... a count!... a nobleman!
do not hold that against me... please!
why should an aristocrat want to go to russia?
business.
what business?
private.
there is no privacy in russia. this whole thing seems very suspicious. what is the real reason? if you ever want to get into russia, take my advice... confess!
confess what?
are you sympathetic to the former czaristic government -- the white russians?
on the contrary -- i do not want to have anything to do with them.
you believe in our cause?
hello, leon darling!
hello.
after our talk last night i took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. knowing how difficult it is to get into soviet russia, i thought i might be of some assistance to you.  may i introduce myself? i am the duchess swana of russia... another russia.
now, please, swana.
count d'algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I will be delighted.
that does it, swana.  now you must not miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
just in case they do not give you your visa to russia i want you to know that i have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little chteau in the touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
thank you, swana. you are very gracious.
she must have her little joke.  you are not going to take that seriously.
the grand duchess swana... active in the white russian movement?
believe me, i have no connection with her any longer... i swear i haven't!
but you had!
listen, i want to be absolutely frank with you. i have no business in moscow.
i think so too.
i want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... it is a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... it is a girl.
so it is love which drags you to moscow.
yes!
no visa.
i must get into that country of yours!
oh no. no visa.
that is impossible! nobody has the right.... you can not do that!... if you do not give me that visa...
you are going to force us... huh?
now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
why should i take a chance?
on what?
how do i know you do not want to blow up a factory?
what for... why?
or a tunnel or a bridge...
suspicions... nothing but suspicions!... that is the trouble with you! if you do not let me in I will stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from russia!... I will picket your whole country....
good evening, anna.
good evening, ninotchka.
are not you late?
no, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
they did not let me. i am in disgrace. last week at the performance of carmen i played a sour note. the conductor got so excited he yelled, "there's sabotage in the string section!"
too bad... you missed an inspiring day, anna.
i know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. when all the tanks and guns were roaring over the red square i sat here all by myself and played a beethoven sonata. not bad at all.  are you expecting someone?
a few friends... just a little dinner party.
what are you serving?
an omelet.
an omelet! are not you living a little above your ration?
well, I have saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we will manage.
it just goes to prove the theory of our state. if you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you are true to the collective spirit and stick together you have got an omelet.  that reminds me... have you heard the latest they are telling about the kremlin?
I will tell you later.  that gurganov, you never know whether he is on his way to the washroom or the secret police.
you should be more careful, anna.
and you too, ninotchka.
about what?
ever since you have been back from paris...
i have not talked to anyone about paris. i have not said a word.
that is just it. it makes people feel queer. i dont' want you to get in any trouble.
i have nothing to hide.
you should. I will show you.
when i passed through the laundry yard today i saw all the women huddled around this so i brought it up here. things like this create a bad feeling. first they did not know whose it was. then they saw the paris label and did it start a commotion! some said it is what we all ought to wear and others said it is like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. it undermines our whole cause.
i see.
you know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
thank you, anna. I will dry it up here when i wash it next. i should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
ninotchka, you know i am your friend, you can trust me.... did you bring back anything else?
no, i left everything in paris. i just happened to be wearing this.
tell me... what else did you have?
well, a hat...
what was it like?
it was very silly.... i would be ashamed to wear it here.
as beautiful as that? what else? come, tell me.
an evening gown.
evening gown?
a dress you wear in the evening.
what do you wear in the morning?
when you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
you mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
yes.
now, ninotchka, you are exaggerating.
no, my dear, it is true. that is how they live in the other world. here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
and there?
well, sometimes they are not completely covered but... they do not freeze.
they must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you do not even see.
you feel it, though.
ninotchka, i would not bring this up if we were not such good friends.
what is it, anna?
you know i told you that pavlov and i are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. would it be asking too much...
you want this?
just for the honeymoon.
you can have it for good. it is my wedding present.
how are you, you three scoundrels?
well, we are back home.
you know what they say -- there is nothing like home.
that is right... and we might as well face it.
come, now, you must not talk that way.... you have to adjust yourselves.... we must be brave.
brave... that is right.
let's be happy that we are all alive.
and that is something we owe to ninotchka.
if you had not given commissar razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
i can tell you exactly.
now let's forget everything except that we are together.
that is right.
let's do that.
it is a real paris reunion.
if you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in paris.
let's not close our eyes. there are many good things to see here too.
i think i need my glasses.
a little more tact... look how nicely she is fixed the table -- all for us.
how nicely you have fixed the table, ninotchka.
what a lovely room you have here.
how many families live here with you?
only myself and two other girls. one is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
just three people in a room this size? whew!
and your own gas cooker? that is marvelous!  naturally it is not the royal suite...
sssh! once and for all, we are in moscow!
yes, there is no doubt of that...  just look out of the window and there it is.
and it is great! think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
she is right...  anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
just see how happy the people look... from here....
can you blame them?... at least the may day parade is over.
that is another thing... it is spring.
the same spring we had in paris. just as good.
even the swallows are back.
it is, ninotchka! it is! he must have been in paris! you can see it in his whole attitude! he just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.
if you asked him why he left france i bet he could not name one good reason.
i should be a swallow! right now i would be sitting in front of the caf de paris picking up flakes of french pastry that would melt in my bill.
now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of french pastry.
yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
we will get that... we will get everything... maybe a little bit later but we will get it... we must be patient... finally we got the spring, did not we? we got the swallows, and you will get your apfel strudel too.
and if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
comrades... I am out of the omelet.
do not worry... there will be enough.
let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
...des raisins de madre, des framboises...
...des petites fraises des bois... de la crme de bretagne...
...so it blows up that big... what they call an omelette surprise!
and the surprise is there is nothing in it.
i know, but if we can not put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination.  in that one omelet we will taste the whole of paris!
what is it, ninotchka?
it is from paris.
from leon.
from leon!... how is he?... come, tell us... open it... tell us... how is he?
bad news?
look for yourselves.
well, i think it is getting late. good night, ninotchka.
thank you for a wonderful dinner.
good morning, comrade.
good morning, comrade commissar. here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
does this include the products of the far eastern provinces?
yes, it does.
you mean you have finished the whole investigation?
yes.
that is marvelous.... you must have worked day and night.... do not you ever sleep?
i need very little sleep. we must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. i have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
well, comrade, i am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
may i ask why?
please... sit down.
cigarette?
thank you.
well, comrade, have you heard from your friends kopalski, buljanoff, and iranoff?
no.
i have not either, but I have heard about them. you must realize it was only on the strength of your paris report that i sent them to constantinople; without that i never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
may i ask what has happened?
as soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance. if i told you what is going on in constantinople right now you would not believe it. those three have been sitting there for six weeks and have not sold a piece of fur.  this anonymous report was sent me. they are dragging the good name of our country through every caf and night club. here...  "how can the bolshevik cause gain respect among the moslems if your three representatives, buljanoff, iranoff, and kopalski, get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it did not fly?"
oh, they should not do such things. are you sure this report is correct?
it gives details which could not be invented. naturally i want to verify it and that is why i need you.
you want me to go to constantinople?
yes... leaving immediately.
i appreciate the confidence you show in me, but i must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. i should hate to interrupt my present work. i am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
that is for me to decide, comrade yakushova.
i am sorry, i do not want to overstep my position -- but please... do not send me.
i do not understand.
how can i make myself clear... it is difficult to express but I would rather not go to foreign countries any more. please, comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... i am in the rhythm of it now... i do not want to go away. i do not want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. it throws one out of gear.... let me finish my work... i have concentrated everything in it... please... do not make me go.
please do not waste my time, comrade. do your duty. good-by.
i will do my best.
but buljanoff, iranoff, kopalski...
now, please, ninotchka, do not start figuring it out in cows.
you have done it again and i am responsible. how can you forget yourselves this way? you were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned bolshevik ideas.
it is high time you got out of russia.
i must be stern with you.
do not forget, the day will come when you will have to face razinin.
good old razinin! is he still alive? how does he manage?
but, comrades...
we are not comrades any more... we are friends, ninotchka.
imagine, we do not have to whisper any longer.
we can say whatever we want. we can shout... we can complain... look...  the service in this hotel is terrible!  see? nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. that is freedom.
no, that is bad management.
is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? i must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
do not ask for it, ninotchka. there is a turkish proverb which says, "if something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
and there is a russian saying: "the cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
with our cream situation what it is, it is russia which should apologize to the cats.
friends... friends, buljanoff, iranoff...
...and kopalski.
do not make it difficult for me. this is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
that was our idea when we first came. all we thought we would get out of this trip was a turkish bath, but... we learned better.
ninotchka, we are in the magic east, the country of aladdin and his lamp...
...ali baba and the forty thieves... into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights.
all you have to do is say "open sesame."
i do not know how i can get you out of it this time. how will it end? what will happen to you?
shall we tell her?
guest?
we have opened a restaurant...
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "dine with buljanof, iranoff, and kopalski."
you mean you are deserting russia?
do not call it desertion. our little restaurant... that is our russia... the russia of borscht, the russia of beef stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
...the russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
we are not only serving good food, we are serving our country... we are making friends.
who gave you this idea? what is responsible for all this?
there is something in constantinople... something irresistible....
...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
right now it is on the balcony.
they would not let me in so i had to get you out.
so -- you are behind all this. i should have known.
trying to keep me away from you! it could not be done. naturally i could not go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but i found a way, did not i? darling, i had to see you. i wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
the one i got they would not let me read.  it began, "ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "yours, leon."
i will not tell you what came between... I will prove it. it will take a long time, ninotchka... at least a lifetime.
but, leon, i am only here for a few days.
if you do not stay with me, I will have to continue my fight. I will travel wherever russian commissions are. I will turn them all into buljanoffs, iranoffs, and kopalskis. the world will be crowded with russian restaurants. I will depopulate russia. once you saved your country by going back. this time you can save it by staying here.
well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can i waver? no one shall say ninotchka was a bad russian.
