gotta be from the norwegian camp.
how far's that?
'bout eighty kilos southwest.
that far?
you catch anything he was saying?
am i starting to look norwegian to you, bwana?
how many in their party?
started with six.  there would be four others left.
... guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
nothing we can do about that.
yes, there is.  I would like to go up.
in this weather?
bennings?
you jerking off or just pissed?
we got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?
get your gear on.
what for?
screw regulations!  four guys could be crawling around on their bellies out there!
so, i do not want to end up crawling around with them when we go down.
look, if you are going to keep bitching, macready -- palmer's offered to take him up...
what are you talking?!  he is had two months training in those choppers!
four!
what is it out there, anyway? forty-five knots?
sixteen.
and the horse you rode in on. sixteen for how long?!  you can not predict this time of year...
my god, what in hell happened here?
come on, copper.
hey, sweden!!!
they are not swedish, goddamn it, they are norwegian, macre --
anything?
all in norwegian.
what are you doing?
could be important work.  might as well bring it back.
it is getting late.  hurry it.  I am going to check the last few rooms.
hey, man...!
you reach anybody yet?
we are a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  it is going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
well, stick to it.
what do you want from us?
just listen.
goes on like that quite awhile.  what do you gentlemen make of it?
could be anything... men in isolation... some beef that snowballed... got out of hand...
what is happening?
childs, you got the torch?  you get your ass in here!!
torch it over there!
the dogs?
screw the dogs!!  torch it!!
we are on fire!
do not let up, childs!
extinguishers.
pretty nasty out, mac.  thirty-five knots.
screw it, I am going up anyway.
was that dog, the norwegian dog?
i just can not comprehend any of this. it was just a dog.
could not make much of it myself.
I have asked him to try and locate the site.  okay with you?
sure.  you think there is a connection?
maybe.
magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  and those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
so what do you make of it?
you know damn well what we both make of it.
no chance it could have been some new kind of test craft?
macready!
look, I am just guessing...
well, go on.
... so it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
i just can not believe this voodoo bullshit.  you believe this voodoo bullshit, blair?
happens all the time, man.  they are falling out of the skies like flies. government knows all about it... chariots of the gods, man... they practically own south america.  i mean they taught the incas everything they knew...
cool it, palmer!!
yeah, they dig him up and cart him back.  he gets thawed out, wakes up and scares the shit out of them. and they get into one hell of a brawl...
now how is this motherfucker wake up after thousands of years in the ice, huh?
i do not know how.  because he is different than we are.  because he is a space guy.  what do you want from me, anyway.  go ask blair.
you buy any of this, blair?
whatever that norwegian dog was... it... it was capable of changing its form...  ... when it attacked our dog... it somehow was able to digest... or... absorb it... and in the process shaped its own cells to imitate our dog's cells exactly...  ... this for instance is not dog at all -- it is imitation... we got to it before it had time to finish or...
finish what?
... i think the whole process would have taken an hour... maybe more. and then i suppose both would have changed back to dog form.
what do you mean "got" to the dog?
it was a life form that was able to imitate and reproduce, whatever it ate or absorbed, cell for cell.
look, i know it is hard to believe...
so what is our problem?
well... there is still some cell activity... it is not entirely dead yet.
clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog?  just anything at all?  any little thing?
no.  just that he recovered real quick... that night when i found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage.  before i put him with the others, i redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
that night?
yeah.
what was he doing in the rec room?
well, after i worked on him -- thought I would let him rest.  left the room for a bit.  when i came back, he was gone.
well, where was he?  where did he go?
do not know.  looked for him for a bit... could not find him.
you are saying he was not put into the kennel until the night?
how long were you with the dog? alone, i mean?
ah... he was hurt bad.  bullet nicked an artery... i do not know... an hour... hour and a half...
what the hell you looking at me like that for?
nothing.  nothing at all.
... it could have gotten to somebody...
anybody sick?
no, i... i do not mean infection... or disease...
couple seconds of an argentine disco station.
well, stick with it.  i want you at it round the clock.  we got to get help in here...
listen to me, garry.  please...
if the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I am sending you and doc up to macmurdo...
do not you understand?!  that thing did not want to become a dog...
damn you, blair!  you have already got everybody half-hysterical around here.
you can not let anybody leave!
I have got six dead norwegians on my hands, a burned up flying saucer, and we have just destroyed the scientific find of the century.  now fuck off!
what's...
blair.  he is gone berserk.
too damn dangerous.
... you think this thing wants to become an animal?  dogs can not make it 1000 miles to the sea.  no skua gulls to imitate this time of year... no penguins this far inland... do not you understand?!  it wanted to become us!
... can not you see...?  if one cell of this thing got out it could imitate every living thing on earth. nothing could stop it!  nothing!
look blair, maybe you are right about this.  but we have got to be rational. we have got to talk this over.  I am unarmed and I am coming in.
no, you are not!  i do not trust any of you!
how you doin', old boy?
i do not know who to trust.
know what you mean, blair.  trust is a tough thing to come by these days. just trust in the lord.
watch clark.
what?
watch him close.  ask him why he did not kennel the dog.
you are not thinking of going after them, are you?
i am going after them.
get these things out of supply and meet me over by the snowmobiles.
you are not going to catch them in one of those with the start they got.
palmer, how long would it take you to strap those big four-cylinder carburetors on?
oh, i got you.  not too long.
then get a move on.  childs, come with me.
i can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
that is good enough.
all right... box of dynamite... box of thermite... three shotguns... box of flares... two flare guns... thirty cans gasoline... and a case of alcohol.
let's load 'em.
maybe dinner.
dogs do not eat each other.
i know.
where is the other half?
probably the next meal.
where these tracks headed?
nowhere... just straight to the ocean.
what we going to do?!
how the fuck do i know?!
torch them!!
but...
he is gone already!  do it!
lighten your load, sucker.  you am not the judge and executioner around here!
who you trying to protect, mutherfucker?  I am telling you this s.o.b. could be one of them.
hold on, damn it.  we are getting nowhere... if this bit of blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
and if it got to clark... clark could have gotten to anybody.
can there be... some kind of test? to find out who is what?
a serum test possibly.
right.  why not?
what is that?
how long will it take you to prepare this?
a couple of hours.
well, get to it.
how is that thing get to the dogs?  i though we stopped it in time.
copper thinks they swallowed pieces of it during the fight.
and that was enough?
well, who is got access to it?
i guess I am the only one.
would that test have worked?
i think so.
somebody else sure as hell thought so.
who else could have used that key?
ah... no one... i give it to copper when he needs it...
could anyone have gotten it from you?
i do not see how... when I am finished i return it right away.
when was the last time you used it?
a day or so ago... i guess.
i suppose... well, it is possible someone might have lifted it from me.  but...
that key ring of yours is always hooked to your belt.  now how could somebody get to it without you knowing?
look, i have not been near that... that refrigerator.
put that down!
no.
I will put this right through your head.
what do we do about those three?
we got morphine, do not we.
we should sleep in shifts.
right.  half of us awake at all times.
how we going to try and find out who's... you know, who is who?
can you think of any other tests?
that thing's too smart to be hiding any more of its clothes, macready.
just keep looking.
childs, where is that magneto from chopper one?
am not it there?
no it am not there.  would i be asking if it were there?
move it, palmer.
what you doin'?
nobody's getting in here.  you can tell them all that!
well, who the hell you think wants to get in there with you?
now why did you go and...
and i do not want any more food with sedatives in it.  i know what you are up to.  do not think i don't.  and if anyone tries to get in here -- I have got rope.  I will hang myself before it gets to me.
you promise?
childs!  that a fuse?
no.  the generator.  you got the auxiliary box just off the kitchen. get to it.  where is the damn flashlight?  you fellas okay over there?
cut that out, copper.  nauls?  what is taking you?!
I am working it!  nothing's happening!
that is impossible, man!  okay, clark, out of the john where i can see you!
it is shorted out or something!
clark, you come on out here!!
somebody is taken it.  i can not find it!
clark, you want me to come in after you?!
what is happened?!
macready, that you?
yeah!
it is the generator i think!  no power.
well, let's get down there.
macready!
what?
garry's missing!
oh, shit!  well, hang on!
gee, thanks!
sanchez...?  hey, who...
mac, where the hell is that pump!!
somebody definitely messed with it.
we going to make it?
hope so.  another ten, fifteen minutes.  what i do not get is...
where were the flashlights?
screw the flashlights.  where the hell were you?
i said where?  where did you go?!
was dark... find a light...
you lying bastard...
we have got to find fuchs.  when we find him -- we kill him.
why?
if he is one of those things, we have got to get to him before he changes... nauls, you and childs and I will check the outside shacks...
sanchez, you and palmer search the inside...
i am not going with sanchez.
well, who says i want you going with me?!
cut the bullshit... okay, sanchez, you come with us.  norris... you stay here...  any of them move -- you fry 'em. and if you hear anything, anything at all you let loose the siren.  we all meet back here in twenty minutes regardless.  and everybody watch whoever you are with.  real close.
what?
do not walk behind me.
I have changed my mind... i'd... I would like to come back inside... i do not want to stay out here any more... funny things... i hear funny things out here.
have you come across fuchs?
fuchs...?  no, it is not fuchs... you must let me back in... i will not harm anyone... i promise...
we will see...
I am getting worried about you.  you ought to have a checkup.
let's just not get worried about anything just now.
after all this mess then.
after all this mess.
auxiliary light cables...?  been cut.
cut, bullshit.  been pulled apart.
this storm do that?
could not be possible.  must have weighted a ton and a half...
somebody broke in.
now who would go and do...
childs!!
let go of me...
do not get near 'em.  the plants! they are alive.  those things can imitate anything...
what is it going to do, being a plant?
we got to burn 'em.
now hold on, you dumb...
why did not it imitate fuchs?  is not that its number -- to get more recruits.
was not enough time.  generator was out, what...?  thirty minutes. takes the bastards an hour, maybe two to absorb somebody.
cut him loose of the line up by his shack.
cut him loose?
when we were up poking around his place... i found this...
... made sure i got ahead of him on the towline on the way back... cut him loose.
macready...?
he is one of them.
when do you think it got to him?
could have been anytime.  anywhere.
if it did get to him.
... hey, somebody!  open up, it is me, macready...  ... come on, damn it... the towline snapped.  been crawling around like a seal out here...
bullshit!  he is got to know damn well i cut it!
let's open it.
hell no.
... nothing human could have made it back here in this weather without a guideline...
... where is everybody?!  I am half frostbit!
let's open it.  now...
why you so damn anxious to let him in here...
he is so close.  maybe our best chance to blow him away.
no.  just let him freeze out there.
what are you doing?
you are a dead man, macready -- or a dead whatever the hell you are!
we found your clothes -- the ones you tried to burn.
what clothes?
you been made, macready.
... ever occur to the jury that anybody could have gotten to some of my clothes and stuck them up...
we am not buying that.
now hold him.
I am a real light sleeper, childs...
enough, macready!
and if anyone tries to wake me...
damn you, macready!
what kind of test?
I am sure a lot of you already know.
palmer, you and copper tie everyone down.  real tight.
what for?
for your health.
let's rush him.  he is not going to blow us all up.
damn if i won't.
you am not tying me up.
then I will have to kill you.
then kill me.
tie up clark, too.
he is dead.
norris looked pretty dead, himself. bullets do not kill these things.
we should have jumped his ass.
now copper, you tie palmer up.
we are going to draw a little bit of everybody's blood.
what are you going to do?  drink it?
watching norris in there... gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole.  every piece of you is self-sufficient, an animal unto itself.  when a man bleeds it is just tissue.  but blood from one of you things will not obey. it is a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life.  when attacked, your blood will try and survive -- and crawl away from a hot needle say.
i guess you are okay.
thank you.
did not think you would use that fibrillator on norris if you were one of them.
load of bullshit.
we will see.  let's try clark.
pure nonsense.  this will not prove a damn thing.
thought you would feel that way, garry. you were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we will do you last...
what is it?
everything that is been missing.
spaceship of some kind.
smart s.o.b.  he put it together piece by piece.
where was he trying to go?
anyplace but here.
what about childs?
forget about childs.  he is over.
what if it does not come?
it will come.  it needs us.  we are the only thing left to imitate...  give me a hand.
you and nauls got to block off the west side bunks, the mess hall and the kitchen.
you crazy?  he might be inside already?
chance we got to take.  we got to force him to come down the east side to the door we got rigged.
he might just wait us out.
I am going to blow the generator when you get back.  he will have to come for us -- or freeze.
looks good.
one thousand volts.  should be enough.
you hear that?
hear what?
it is got into the pub!  it is turned on the stereo!
what?!
it is in between us and them!!  how we going to get back?!
can not hear you.
get back!!
the generator!
screw the generator!!
got sanchez... world war three would not mess with this fucker... can go through walls... and it is like all over the place...
calm down and get in your position.
position, my ass...
how long's it been?
little over two hours.
maybe it am not coming.
then we go after him.
bet the last place you ever go.
i think so.
what do you mean "you think so?"
not the only one.
the fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... will not last long though.
neither will we.
maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
maybe we shouldn't.
then we will never make it.
maybe we should not make it.
if you are worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
if we have got any surprises for each other -- we should not be in any condition to do anything about it.  you play chess?
