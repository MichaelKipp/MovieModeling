how's it going.
do you think that guy's cute?
don't you like him?
yeah, but i fucked up. you can take it. really.
come on, stacy, it's your section and your man.
what should i do?
just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot.
you look like you could still be in high school.
i know, everyone says that.
what can i get for you tonight.
how about your phone number?
do you ever look at those girls who work at swenson's? they're beautiful. and i have to stand out here and watch them six nights a week.
you should work for yourself.
something happened to them, mon.
come on, spicoli. why don't you just put your shirts back on? see the sign?
any problems?
no, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. i took care of it, dennis.
did you throw away those fries, hamilton?
they were left over from the last shift.
those were perfectly good fries, hamilton.  perfectly good.
but they weren't mine.
he gave me his card.  'ron johnson, audio consultant.'
should we buy a frame for that?
come on, linda, i haven't had a boyfriend all summer. you promised when i started working at the mall that my life would change... do you think he'll call this week?
listen, stace, you want to know about guys? i'll tell you. they're mostly chicken. before i met doug i chased after every guy i thought was cute. i thought if i gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. well, guess what? they don't call.
so what did you do?
i called them. if i was sitting next to a guy and i wanted to sit closer, i'd sit closer. if i wanted to kiss him, i'd just do it. you want ron johnson? grab him.
i can't do that.
face it. with some guys you have to make the first move. a lot of guys are just... wussies.
really?
stacy, what are you waiting for? you're fifteen. i did it when i was thirteen. it's no huge thing. it's just sex. if you don't, one of the other girls will.
he was hot, wasn't he?
if i didn't have a fianc in chicago, i'd go for it.
are you linda barrett?
yes.
i'm carrie frazier from toys 'r us. judy hinton from may company told me i could ask you something.
all right, what you want to do is go to the free clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need nornel one plus fifty's.
and they don't call my parents?
not if you're over sixteen.
okay. thanks a lot, linda.
and don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
i can't believe i start high school tomorrow.
believe it.
brad, can i talk to you a minute?
arnold. what's happening?
brad, i really fuckin' hate mcdonald's, man. ever since they started in with the chicken, everything went downhill.
you want to work at carl's?
oh, man, if you could swing something there, i'd do anything for you. i want to work with you guys.
i can probably get you in there. just let me talk to dennis taylor.
all right!!
hi, brad.
sis.
everyone wants to know where lisa is. how should i know where lisa is?  what am i gonna do? now my little sister goes to the same high school. the party's over.  so who do you have first period?
u.s. history. mr. hand.
hey-yo.
yeah. i'm registered for this class.
what class?
this is u.s. history, right? i saw the globe in the window.
really?
can i come in?
oh, please. i get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and i don't see all my kids here.
mr. spicoli?
that's the name they gave me.
you just ripped my card in two!
yes.
hey, bud. what's your problem?
i hear some surfer pulled a knife on mr. hand this morning.
no way! he just called him a dick.
god. people exaggerate so much at this school.
linda. that girl looks just like pat benatar.
i know.
do you think guys find that attractive?
oh, give me a break, stacy. you're much prettier than them.
yeah but they look more sophisticated. you'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
what do you mean 'better in bed.' you either do it or you don't.
no there are variables that, like, i might not be good at.
what variables?
like, you know, giving blow jobs.
what's the big deal?
well i never did it.
there's nothing to it.
just kidding. about 10cc.
oh! that's where that group got its name from.
thanks for picking me up.
no problem.
'the cuer-vo gold, the fi-ine columbian.'  you look nice tonight.
thanks. so do you.
where do you feel like going?
i don't know. wherever you want.
how about the point?
the point sounds fine.
all right, the point it is.
that's a nice shirt.
thanks. thanks a lot.
it's very warm out tonight.
it is. it's very warm. i wonder how long it will last?
are you really nineteen?
yes... i am really nineteen.
i think i better take you home.
what about those other guys you live with?
no. i mean back to your home.
is this your first time?
yes.
was it great?
it was okay.
you'll always remember your first time.
it was nice.
so tell me, do you like ron? is it serious?
come on, linda. it's just sex.
hey! that's my line!
mom says to clean up the pool.
why can't you do it?
your friends use the pool. your friends messed it up.
your friends use the pool too.
i take out the garbage.
don't strain yourself.
brad! have mom or dad seen this?
they're not home yet.
brad, what would you say if i asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the cruising vessel and get rid of them at work?
i'd say... who the hell is ron johnson?
i'll explain everything later.
you... are a wuss. part wimp. part pussy.
what do you mean -- wuss? this girl is my exact type. it's her. definitely her.
it's definitely your mama.
damone, you gotta listen to me.
all right... where did you see her?
she's in my biology class.
did you get her number?
no.
did you get her name?
no. it's too soon.
it's never too soon! girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
well, what do you want me to do? go up to this strange girl in my biology class and say, 'hello! i'd like you to take your clothes off and jump on me?'
i would. yeah.
really?
i can see it all now. this is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at fotomat this summer. you bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
you tell me, mike. what do i do?
okay. okay.  here's what you do.
don't talk to her. let her know. use your face. use your body. use everything. this is what i do. i just sent out the vibe and i have personally found that... girls do respond. something happens.
of course something happens. you put the vibe out to thirty million chicks, you know something's gonna happen.
that's the idea, rat. that's the attitude.
the attitude? the attitude dictates that you don't care if she comes, stays, lays or prays. whatever happens, your toes are still tappin'. when you are the cruelest and the coolest... then you have the attitude.
were those flowers really for me, brad?
of course.
how much did they cost?
don't worry about it.
what's there to do at the point? god, lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
brad. i don't want to have to use sex as a tool.
tool? tool for what? we've been going together almost two years!
i don't want to talk about it here, brad.
thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
don't worry about it. who sent the flowers?
it's just some guy i met at swenson's. you don't know him.
i don't care it you tell me or not. i got problems of my own.
is everything okay at work?
are you kidding? work is great. i kill at work. i don't even mind mom and dad making me pay rent.
you're going to break up with lisa, aren't you?
i've been doing some thinking. it's my last school year. i'm a single, successful guy. i think i want my freedom.
why? because she won't sleep with you?
where did you hear that?
i'm just guessing.
well... it's true.
maybe you just need to give her some time. she's so nice, brad. everybody loves lisa.
everybody loves lisa. everybody loves lisa. but everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
hey, brad. are you still a virgin?
why?
i don't know. i was just curious.
maybe yes. maybe no.
you are a virgin!
i didn't say that.
but your face did!
are you still a virgin?
maybe yes. maybe no.
don't give me that shit! i know you're still a virgin!
there... there's his car. i know he's at work tonight. he hasn't come into swenson's since he called my house. my mother told him i was still at high school, after i told him i was nineteen. i guess i should tell him i'm fifteen.
don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
does doug care that you're seventeen?
doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. that's why i'm marrying him.
if he ever calls again i'll say i'm eighteen.
boy i am so glad to be through with all these games.
hey! wait a minute! there's no birthday party for me here!
thank you, desmond.  what's the reason for your truancy?
i couldn't make it in time.
you mean, you couldn't? or you wouldn't?
i don't know, mon. the food lines took forever.
food will be eaten on your time!  why are you continuously late for this class, mr. spicoli? why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
i don't know.
you've got to get used to working christmas. people are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all christmasy.
i think christmas brings out the worst in people.
i guess ron hasn't called yet.
not since november.
don't you think it meant anything to him. even if i am fifteen?
stacy. what does it matter? he's a stereo salesman. you want to marry him? you want to have kids with him? you want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little pacific stereo badge on? come on.
i should quit this job. i'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
stacy. how many times do i have to tell you? you are really going to be beautiful... someday.
thanks a lot.
the business is changing, rat. i'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to aerosmith.
i hear they all dress like that at lincoln now.
there used to be three or four of those guys. now we see 'em every time we come to the mall.
hey, rat.
yeah?
ace the jacket.
what do you do with the jackets people leave here?
we keep them.
you keep them.
we keep them, in case the people come back.
what's your other question?
my other question is... can-i-have your-phone-number-so-i-can-ask-you out-sometime?
do you have a pen? this one's out of ink.
oh... yes.
come on. clean that counter off brad. let's go. play ball.
okay, dennis.
well, i believe you have to fill out a form. there's a pad right around here.
no. i want my money back right now.
well, that's not the way it works, really. and you ate most of your food already, too...
see that sign? it says 100% money back guarantee. do you know the meaning of the word 'guarantee'? do they teach you that here? give me my money back.
i can't do that. but if you wait a minute...
look. just put your little hand back in the cash register and give me my $2.75 back. okay?  please, brad?
i'm sorry, sir. just let me find the forms here.
i am so tired. i am so tired of dealing with morons. how hard is it to...
mister, if you don't shut up, i'm gonna kick 100% of your ass.
manager!!
did you threaten this man or use profanity in any way?
he insulted me first. he called me a moron.
did you threaten this customer or use profanity in any way?
yes, sir.
you're fired.
how've you been?
outrageous, merv. nice to be here. i feel great.
i was going to say... your eyes look a little red.
i've been swimming, merv.
seriously, merv, everything is great. i was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
i wanted to talk a little bit about school, if i could...
school.  school is no problem. all you have to do is go to get the grades. and if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
how often do you go?
i don't go at all.
i hear you brought a film clip with you. do you want to set it up for us?
well, it pretty much speaks for itself. peter, you want to run with it?
merv, this is the action down at sunset cliffs at about six in the morning.
fascinating.
who's that?
that's me, merv.
are you going to ride that wave?
totally.
what's going through your mind right here, jeff? the danger of it all?
merv, i'm thinking... i've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards.
dad says you have to get up!
ugh.
leave me alone!
dad says you're late again, you butthole!
leave me alone.
dad says!
man, i don't even want to see those guys from carl's again.
if you'd apologize i think dennis would take you back.
apologize to that wimp? no way. fuck dennis taylor.
i'm just glad we're still together, lisa, because i need you this year.
look, brad, i've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. we're almost out of high school, this is our last year. i think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
what do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? you know, mark ratner.
oh, come on. what is he? fifteen?
sixteen.
knock it off, damone. i need real help.
what do you mean? men have died trying to obtain this information. i will give it to you for free.
okay. tell me. what's the five point plan?
all right. pay attention.
and that is how you talk to a girl, rat. voila. you can't miss.
i think i've got it. once i get going, i'll be okay. but... how do i get started? i mean, i hardly know her.
you wuss. it's no problem. one person says something to the other and that's how it starts...
thanks for coming to get me.
sure thing.
this is a nice car.
yeah. it's my sister's.
do you have mrs. george for english?
yeah. she is pretty good.
yeah. she is pretty good.
joey at cinema four said this is a pretty good restaurant.
i've heard that, too.
do you know what you want?
i think i'll have the seafood salad special.
excellent.
are you all right?
oh yeah.
do you mind if i excuse myself for a moment?
not at all.
are you ready to order here?
well... sure.  she will have the seafood salad special. and i will have... the same.
anything to drink?
two cokes.
okay. thanks.
yo.
damone. it's mark.
mark. what happened to your date?
it's happening right now. i'm here at the atlantis. everything's fine except... i left my wallet at home.
did you go home and get it?
no. it's too late. the food is coming and everything. damone, i've got to ask you this favor, and i'll never ask you for anything again in this lifetime or any other. will you please borrow your mom's car, go by my house, get my wallet, and meet me back here?
damone, are you there?
i'm really pretty busy...
are you sure there's nothing else i can bring you?
i'll have one more coke... do you want another coke, stacy?
sure. i'll... have another coke.
two more cokes.
hey, mark. is that you?
damone! you come here?
i come for the seafood. it's great! hey... you know what, mark? i found your wallet the other day. you want it back?
wow. i've been looking for that thing! hey, damone, have you met stacy hamilton? stacy, this is mike damone.
well, i've gotta be running.
okay. see ya.
nice to meet you, stacy.
nice to meet you.
i had a really nice time tonight.
me, too. i'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
i never thought it would happen at the atlantis. jeez.
do you want to come inside?
aren't your parents asleep?
no, they're away for the weekend. brad and i are watching the house.
okay. sure. i'll come in.
where's your brother?
i don't know. probably out. want something to drink?
no. that's okay.
well, i'm going to change real quick. i hope you don't mind.
naw. i don't mind.
so... pretty nice house you've got here.
thanks. so...  what do you want to do?
i don't know.
do you want to see some pictures? i kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. how stupid, right?
sure.
this is me in the eighth grade. did you have mr. deegan?
oh, yeah. i had mr. deegan.
...i've got to go home.
do you really have to go?
well... it's getting kind of late.
hey, slow down. this is my brother's car.
i thought he was out of town.
he is.
then don't hassle it.
seen the new playboy?
naw. any good?
suzanne somers' tits.
all right.
i like sex.
what the fuck is this guy doing?
this ain't no cop.
it's a bunch of jocks in a granada!
they're fuckin' with us.
my brother's car!
all right. die, granada jocks!
we just missed the turnoff to the party.
you know the thing i love about mustangs? the steering wheel.
my brother is going to kill us. he's gonna kill you and then he's gonna kill me. he's gonna kill us.
just be glad you're all right.
my brother is gonna shit.
make up your mind. is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
first he's gonna shit. and then he's gonna kill us.
will you just relax, mon? he's not gonna kill us. my father is a television repairman. he's got all kinds of tools. i can fix-this car.
you can't fix this car, spicoli.
i sent a letter to doug today. i'll be so glad when he gets out here.
you really ought to look at this, linda. there's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. it's like school.
why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
listen to this... 'what are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
okay, penis, that's one, balls...
wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
you're right. probably penis, mouth and neck.
all right! here's another one. 'the most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
climax together.
does that ever happen?
no. but it's a nice idea.
listen to this... it says 'most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.'
how long does doug take?
i don't know. thirty to forty minutes.
what's doug do in chicago?
he works for the airline. he'll be out here. you'll meet him.
hey! we came over to help you with math homework!
oh, really?
what do you think?
i think they're both virgins.
i didn't ask for any help. did you, linda?
no.
well, that's exactly why i brought some wisk for the jacuzzi.
o-kay, you guys can come swimming. but you have to leave as soon as my mom gets home. okay?
does mom know you have company?
it's just linda. and mark from school.
god, he hardly even talks anymore.
i know. he hates to have to wear uniforms.
poor guy.
really.
no. i don't think so. not right now.
chicken!
stacy! i've got water in my ears. do you have any q-tips?
god, i don't think so. better look in the house.
am i hallucinating here? just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
learning about cuba. having some food.
mr. spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. you're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
i've been thinking about this, mr. hand. if i'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
you better save some for me, you swine!
and you, my friend. i'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
hamilton, come over here. what is that you've got on?
this is how i dress all the time.
but you took off your captain kidd uniform.
i thought i'd take it off for the drive over to ibm. it's kind of uncomfortable.
come on, hamilton. you're going over there to represent captain kidd fish and chips. we have stores all over southern california. part of our image, part of our appeal is in our uniforms. you know that!
you really want me to put all this stuff back on?
yes. i think so. show some pride, hamilton.
i can't wait until i can drive next year. i walk every day. it's such a drag.
get a ride with somebody.
sometimes i get a ride with my brother. but he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
what a guy.
you know mark ratner really likes you. you like him?
mark is a really nice boy...
do you have any ice tea?
sure. come on in.
i guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. are you going to get one?
i don't know.
aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
i know what i look like.
do you want to take a quick swim?
well...
brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... i'm going to my room to change!
pick a suit.
i don't know. it's getting pretty late...
are you really a virgin?
come on...
listen. i feel pretty strange here. because mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
he's my friend, too.
you're a really good kisser.
so are you.  are you shaking?
no. are you crazy?
why don't you take off your clothes, mike?
you first.
how about both of us at the same time?
i want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
let's continue.
hey, mike?
what? are you all right?
i think we're making a lot of noise.
i'm sorry. i'm really sorry.
what's wrong?
i think i came. didn't you feel it?
i guess i did.
where's mike today?
today's april 16th. damone never comes to school on april 16th.
what's april 16th?
it's john bonham's birthday.
john bonham?
john bonham. the drummer for led zeppelin. he died a couple years ago. every birthday he stays home and plays everything john bonham ever recorded. it's like his own holiday.
oh. i see.
oh. hi.
i didn't see you this morning.
look, i'm kind of in a hurry.
i'm in a hurry too. i just thought i could say hi to you.
hello.
i made a fool of myself.
nobody noticed. don't worry about it. we'll just stay out here until everyone comes out, we'll blend back in.
what about the notes?
i'll get you the notes.
god, stacy, it's not that sad. it's just david soul and ricardo montalban.
i don't know, i'm just so depressed. everything is just so... depressing.
you have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
i don't know... i just don't feel right.
what do you think it is?
what do you think it is?
it couldn't be.
it could be. i had a pregnancy test at the clinic. i'll find out monday. i guess it was damone.
of course it was damone. if it was ron johnson, you'd be out to here!
i'm not going to tell him. he's an asshole. i hate him.
but it costs money to have an abortion. even at the free clinic. you tell damone to pay for it. it's the least he can do. it's the guy's responsibility too.
you know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
what?
you didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
you're right. i didn't tell you that.
what's going on?
mike, there's something that's been on my mind and i have to tell you about it.
what? now?
why don't you call me up tonight?
mike. i want you to know that i'm pregnant.
how do you know it's mine? we only did it once.
i know it's yours.
take that back.
all right, i take it back.
there's only one thing we can do. we've got to get rid of it. we've got to get an abortion.
we've got to get an abortion?
yeah. my brother art got his girlfriend one once.
it's already planned, mike. it's going to cost $150 at the free clinic.
doesn't sound free to me.  so you want me to pay for it?
half. okay?  seventy-five dollars. and a ride to the clinic.
seventy-five dollars, and a ride. okay.
yeah. this is it. i have some shopping to do.
see you later.
thanks a lot, brad. i really appreciate it.
since when do you shop at the flea market anyway?
brad. please don't tell mom and dad...
you're not going to tell me, are you?
no.
all right, then. it's your secret.
i really thought he would show up. i waited... and waited... and waited...
that little prick.
then i called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
that little prick.
i paid for it and everything.
there goes your stereo for another year. mike damone is a no-brain little prick. i'm not letting him get away with this.
don't do anything, linda. i'd rather just forget about it. i don't even like the guy.
stacy, he's not a guy.  he's a little prick!
if you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. you understand what i'm saying?
no damone. i don't understand.
she wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
hey fuck you damone. there's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with stacy. what have you got to prove?
jesus. i'm sorry.
i always stick up for you. whenever people say 'aw, that damone is a loudmouth' -- and they say that a lot -- i say 'you just don't know damone.' when someone says you're an idiot, i tell them 'damone's not an idiot. you just don't know him.' well, you know, damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. and i'm just finding out.
fine. get lost.
go ahead. just make it quick.
totally.
it's the first door on your left.
i can't find it, mon!
it's the first door on your left!
on the ledge?
first door on your left!
there it is!
another summer of working at swenson's.
come on. there's lots of men around here. keep your eyes open.
you know, linda. i've finally figured it out. it's not sex i want. anyone can have sex.
what do you want?
i want romance.
romance in ridgemont? we don't even get cable tv.
mike! you have a mess on c-9!
all right. all right. i just cleaned b-8. give me a break.
get going.
jeff you have company!
go away, curtis. if you can't knock, i can't hear you.
mr... mr. hand.
that's right, jeff. mind if i come in?
were you going somewhere tonight, jeff?
yeah. the graduation dance mr. hand. it's the last school event of the year.
i'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, jeff.
did i do something wrong, mr. hand?
do you want to sit there, jeff?
i don't know. i guess so.
fine. you sit right here on your bed. i'll use the chair here.  as i explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- i don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. i'd rather be preparing the lesson.
now, mr. spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. now i have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. tonight, you and i are going to talk in great detail about the davis agreement, all the associated treaties, and the american revolution in particular. now if you can just turn to chapter 47 of lord of truth and liberty.
hey, it's in my locker, mr. hand.
well, then, i'm glad i remembered to bring an extra copy just for you.
i think i've made my point with you tonight.
hey, mr. hand, can i ask you a question?
what's that?
do you have a guy like me every year? a guy to... i don't know, make a show of. teach other kids lessons and stuff?
well, you'll find out next year.
no way, mon. when i graduate u.s. history i ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
if you graduate.
you're gonna flunk me?!
don't worry, spicoli. you'll probably squeak by.
all right! oh, yeah!
aloha, mr. hand!
aloha, spicoli.
where's doug?
he's not coming.
not coming? what happened?
he says he's got to stay in chicago.  he says i should visit him sometimes.
sometime?
yeah, like maybe never.
but what are you going to do?
well i might go to dartmouth.
dartmouth?!
i didn't tell anyone i applied cause i never thought i'd make it.
i can't believe it! but what about doug?
there's a world of guys out there. i just wish i didn't have to date any of them.
hey -- doug stallworth? it's his loss.
you're losing it, damone.
you're crazy. those girls love me.
easy, mon.
later.
that's him! he did it!
hey, mon, i don't know what your trip is, but...
hi, mark.
hi, stacy. how are you?
i'm fine. mark, i'm so glad you came over here because i want you to know something. i just thought i would tell you that i really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
yeah? about fifty people i didn't know wrote that in my annual.
i know everybody says it, but i really mean it.
really?
yeah. i want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what i look like. and so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
well, i don't know, i may be doing some traveling this summer. i don't know how much i'll be around...  but i'll give you a call sometime.
i'd like that.
the attitude, damone, is only good until you meet the right girl.
whatever you say, rat.
and... you can only tell it's the right girl if you're sensitive.
sensitive -- what is that?
sensitive is when you can tell how people feel without asking.
so what makes you so sensitive?
well, for one, i read. i don't watch as much television as you. i'm trying to feel things more. i'm learning a lot about people.
what do you read? what's the last book you read?
lust for life. it's the story of vincent van gough.
yeah, well, i saw the movie. that must mean i'm sensitive too.
it's a way, damone. it's a vibe. i put it out, and i have personally found that girls do respond.
