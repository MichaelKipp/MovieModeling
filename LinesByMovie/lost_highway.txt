you do not mind that I am not coming tonight?
what are you going to do?
i thought I would stay home and read.
it is nice to know i can still make you laugh.
i like to laugh, fred.
that is why i married you.
wake me up when you get home.
what is that?
a videotape.
who is it from?
i do not know... there is no return address on the envelope... in fact, there is no address on it.
does it say anything on the tape?
no, nothing.
it must be from a real estate agent.
maybe.
good book, huh?
huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
same one you were reading the other night?
what night?
when you did not come to the club.
oh. oh, yeah. no. this is a different one.
i called, you know.
called? when?
from the club. you did not answer.
i must have fallen asleep. i was asleep when you got home, was not i?
you were asleep when i got home, yes.
i had a dream about you last night...
yeah?
you were in the house... calling my name... but i could not find you.
you are up early.
that dog woke me. i lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
who the hell owns that dog?
what is that? another tape?
yes, i just found it on the step.
do not you want to watch it?
i guess so.
we have got to call the police.
all right.
so?
two detectives are coming out.
that is it.
let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
very strange.
what is?
the angle. the high angle shot on the tape.
how did the camera get so high like that?
and smooth... almost no movement - back and forth, i mean.
like you would get if it was hand held.
right... this just glided along.
do you always sleep here?... in this room?... both of you?
this is our bedroom.
there is no other bedroom?
no... there is, i mean, i use it as a practice room... it is soundproofed.
you are a musician?
yes, i thought my wife...
what is your axe?
tenor... tenor saxophone. do you...
tone deaf.
do you own a video camera?
no. fred hates them.
i like to remember things my own way.
what do you mean by that?
how i remember them. not necessarily the way they happened.
why not?
it kept going off for some reason. false alarms.
might be a good time to try using it again.
anybody else have a key to the house.
no.
maid? relative?
no, one of us is always here to let the maid in. nobody else has a key.
we will keep a watch on the house.
as best we can.
if anything else happens, you will call us.
we will.
thanks, guys.
what the hell is going on?!
i wish i knew.
what was that?!!!
what?
on the tape! there was something else on the tape.
you do not remember being awakened? it looks like you were aware of someone.
or something.
no, i do not remember anything. it looks like i... but... i do not remember.
why would anyone do something like this?
has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
or not so recently?
we will see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
i do not know if i want to stay here. i do not feel safe.
where would you feel safe?
i do not know. maybe a hotel.
did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
the first night... not the last two.
why not?
i forgot. anyway, i hate the idea of acting paranoid.
I will make sure the alarm is set from now on.
but that does not solve the problem. who is doing this? and why?
we have met before, have not we?
i do not think so. where was it that you think we have met?
at your house. do not you remember?
no, no i don't. are you sure?
of course. in fact, I am there right now.
what do you mean? you are where right now?
at your house.
that is absurd.
i thought you were getting me a drink?
just a minute.
andy, who is that guy?
i do not know his name. he is a friend of dick laurent's, i think.
dick laurent?
yes, i believe so.
but dick laurent is dead, is not he?
he is? i did not think you knew dick. how do you know he is dead?
i don't. i do not know him.
dick can not be dead. who told you he was dead?
let's go home.
but...
now! we are leaving now! i did not want to come here in the first place.
it was a long time ago... i met him at this place called moke's... we... became friends... he told me about a job...
what job?
i do not remember... anyway, andy's okay...
he is got some fucked up friends.
i told you to stay in the car!
why? what is it? why did you make me wait out here?
i thought there might be somebody inside.
was there?
no... of course not.
did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
how could i miss it? the tv will not quit with that stuff.
they are going to cook him.
andy's from utah. he says there you have a choice... you can die by hanging or by firing squad.
which would you choose?
andy would go for this, do not you think?... firing squad, definitely.
do they aim for the head or for the heart?
the heart, i guess.
i wouldn't... the brain would know what is going on. your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. savage pain, marian.
something wrong?
my... my head.
headache, huh? too much sun, i guess. you want to come in?  still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
no, no. i want to go in.
what is bothering you, madison?
the pain is getting worse. i need more aspirin.
i can not give you anymore. I will talk to the doctor.
what is it?
aspirin... fly head. i gotta have more aspirin.
the doctor said not to give you anything. you can see him in the morning.
but my head...
now, mack, what is the situation?
I am not entirely certain, captain. you will have to see for yourself.
that is not fred madison?
no, sir, it is not.
who is it?
i could not say, sir... captain henderson?
yeah, mack?
captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
repeat that, bill.
warden, it is not him. it was not fred madison in that cell.
of course, it is madison!!! who else could it be?
i do not know. the guards say they have never seen him before.
where is he now?
he is in the infirmary, being examined.
did you ask him who he is?
he... he can not talk. it appears as if he can not talk, anyway.
if he is not madison, then where is madison?
I have got men searching the building and the grounds now.
what is this, rogoff?
i do not know yet.
who is this man?
he is just been fingerprinted, and I will run these blood tests right away. we will find out soon enough.
he is not madison?
not even close.
i examined madison last night, marshall. he had a headache.
a headache?
i did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill. I have never seen this man before. neither have the guards. i do not think he is in the system.
how about madison? have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
nothing, marsh. vanished. there is an apb out on him. his photo's been faxed nationwide.
one of the guards must have leaked it.
what is the word on the street?
a cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named fred madison.
the wife killer?
yes.
his condition? what do you mean?
his physical condition.
same as always. pete takes care of himself.
i would not know how.
you say you have not seen your son since the day before yesterday?
when he went to work, right.
what about yesterday?
he did not come home.
i want to see him.
yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  mel, let's get peter in here.
pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
pete, what happened to you?
have you made any charges against him?
no.
then he is coming home with his mother and me.
all right... but you see our predicament... legally we can not hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  for now, he is free to leave.
you just gonna let him go?
we will get a tail put on him.
just rest easy, pete. you are going to be okay.
are you hungry, honey? I will fix you something.
no... i do not feel so good. i would like some aspirin.
coming up.
now we will see what this son of a bitch is up to.
yeah.
where is pete?
out in back.
you talk to him?
no... here he comes.
better.

no.
six fuckin' car lengths... that is about a hundred and six fuckin' feet, mister! you were following ten feet behind me... if I would had to stop suddenly, you would have hit me. i want you to get a driver's manual, and i want you to study that motherfucker... and i want you to obey the god damn rules. fifty fuckin' thousand people were killed on the road last year.  cause of fuckin' assholes like you. tell me you are going to get a manual.
I will get a manual.  and study it.
fuckin' "a".
sorry about that, pete, but tailgating is one thing i can not tolerate.
i can see that.
I will bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
eight, nine car lengths. a hundred and sixty-two feet.

I will be upstairs with andy... the back door will be open... that leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there is a bar there... at eleven fifteen, I will ask andy to fix me a drink... when he does, you can crack him in the head... okay?

okay.
you are doin, okay?  that is good, pete.
look... it is late, mr. eddy... i ...
I am really glad you are doin' okay, pete.
you sure you are doin' okay? everything all right?
yeah.
that is good, pete. hey... i want you to talk to a friend of mine.
i do not think so. where was it that you think we have met?
at your house. do not you remember?
no. no, i don't.
we just killed a couple of people...
what?
what is goin' on?
great question!! in the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they are sent to a place where they can not escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... this uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, do not you think? it is been a pleasure talking to you.
you got him.
alice, i...
you all right?
we killed him.
you killed him.
alice?
alice...
we gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
where is the bathroom?
up the stairs - down the hall.
look at all this shit... i know a fence... he will give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  we can go anywhere.
alice?
where is alice?
alice who?
we have got pete dayton's prints all over this place.
you know what i think?
what is that, ed?
there is no such thing as a bad coincidence.
