something wrong with the stairs?
avoid-all-contact-day.
what?
when dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
t-t-thanks alice...
earth to alice...
rick, please.
alright, i think i see salvation...
don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
what?
the mirror.  you can't see yourself in it.
i don't want to.
yeah.  she'd be half as strict as you.
but she wouldn't let dad treat me like that.
look, you gotta stand up for yourself. learn to fight back.
rick...i can't.
never say can't.  just do what i do.
here you are.  where were you this morning?  rick's looking all over for you.
have you seen joey and kincaid!  god, i can't find them.  i can't find them anywhere.
i'm sure they're around.
yeah, i'm not so sure.
i love to dream, i just hate ones about my dad.
you could do worse.
my mom taught me when i was little.  did you ever hear of the dream master?
sounds like a game show host to me.
no really, it's a fable.  the 'guardian of good' dreams.  it was like my teddy bear when i was growing up.
great, you wouldn't happen to know his phone number?
i daydream.  you have to dream about some place fun.  remember you're in control.
how'd you learn so much about dreams?
when they're all you have, you kinda become an expert.
you what?
when i used to have nightmares.  i brought my friends in to help me.  until they all started dying.
what is it?
oh god!  he killed them!
feeling better now?
yeah.  i guess so... what happened?
you had a nasty bump.
i gotta get out of here.
you just stay put.  you need rest.
you don't get it, he's after me...
don't worry, honey
no...
you're his sister, right?
rick stayed later after school with kristen.  she wasn't feeling very well.
tell him i was looking for him, okay?  i'm dan.
i know.  uh...alice.
you in a hurry?
i gotta get to the library before it closes.  killer physics test.
i know.  i hardly have any time to study.
maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  you don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
i know.
i think sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
give her time.  beauty is skin deep.
alice, you think you can leave?
what's wrong?
kincaid and joey died last night.
what?
hey, rick!
excuse me, ladies.  i'll just be a moment.
kristen, what happened?
you'll hear all kinds of stories. they'll tell you it was murder, but it wasn't.
now you know who and what freddy really is.
i though freddy was just an old town story.
it's no story.  it happened.  freddy's real and he's back.
i'll tell you later.
it's no just a house. it's his home. he's waiting there for me...to dream.
it's okay, babe.  we're with you.
i told you you can't help.  this isn't a normal nightmare. i'm doomed.
i don't get it.
let me talk to you.
so what's up?  what'd i miss?
she told us the story of freddy.  it's a town legend.  he was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
so?
it pissed off a lot of parents. according to kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
nice neighborhood.
now it gets weird.  she says he comes back in dreams.  if he kills you there, you're dead for real.
something the matter with the cuisine?
well mom, i'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
you're just tired.  don't think i haven't noticed your not sleeping.  that has to stop, honey.
what's wrong with me?
your distraught.  it'll help...
i'm sorry honey, but...
sorry!! sorry that you and your tennis pals torched this guy who's now after me. in case you haven't been keeping score, it's his fucking banquet, and i'm the last course!!
honey, we went over this in therapy.
mother, you've just murdered me.  take that to your goddamn therapy...
you alright?
kristen...
hey man, we're all sorry...
she knew she was gonna die.
i thought it was an accident.  smoking in bed.
it was no suicide.  it was not an accident.  it was freddy, and he's coming back for seconds, thirds, and fourths.
i was there in the dream.  he took her. it was awful.  it was awful...
"in her dream"?
ohhhhbaby, i am dead on my feet.
we have matching luggage.
what?
you've been up all night?
that obvious, huh?
then you saw him, too?
saw who? i was up all night cramming for this physics test, and i was putting this little baby together.  look...
asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  she was gonna be a doctor.
it was freddy.
enough of that crap.
i saw it. it was my dream.  i brought sheila in...
no, don't!  i gave sheila to him and now she's dead!
kristen's story really got to her.
i heard you screaming.  was it a bad one?
it was bad.
doesn't the dream master work for you anymore?
i can't find him.
hey, since when do you play thomas edison?  this looks like sheila's.
it is...was. it's a zapper, it might help me stay awake.
yeah, or turn you into toast.
i can't go back to sleep again.
i haven't slept much either.  since kristen...
we'll figure it out.
figure it out?!?!  i'll be insane before i figure it out.  the only thing i'm sure of is that i can't go to sleep.  not while he's using me.
then we'll stay up together.
i've been working double shifts.
extra money, huh?
look, you know why, you just don't believe me.
no offense, or anything, but it's kind of hard to swallow.
the story is, the deaths you can't argue with.
how long have you been awake?
three days.
alright, let's assume this whole thing is true. why does freddy all of a sudden need you?
kristen was the last child left of the people who killed freddy.  maybe freddy can't get to new kids without someone like me.  someone to bring them to him.
been up with alice.
how she doing?  i ran into her last night.
she's blaming herself for sheila.  i know how it feels.  i've been thinking about kristen.  maybe i could've stopped it, if i'd listened.
about freddy?
what else?  you ever look over this town's history?  not a safe place to be a teenager.  anyway, if i'm next, watch your back.
not really.
is there something we can do?
i don't think so.  i guess this is my own war.
you don't really get it.  he's not a nightstalker.  it'll take more than bench presses to beat him.
why can't we just talk to the authorities?
yeah, right.  let's trade death by freddy for life in a rubber room.  adults won't see it. they can't.
then what else can we do?
try what other kids did.  keep each other awake.  we'll meet at debbie's tonight. at least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
who?
he's going after debbie, i gotta stop him.
hey, you're not alone.  we have to stop him, i'm with you.
you just feel sorry for me.
cut that shit out.  maybe before, but not now. i want to help you. i'm on your side.
as long as your driving doesn't kill us.
it's okay, we're just about there.
he's going after debbie.  i gotta stop him.
you know, i get the weirdest feeling we've been through this before.
here we are.
something's wrong here.  it feels like...
what the hell was that?
debbie.  she's gone.  i've...collected her, like the others.
you look great!
save it for later.  come on!
something wrong with the stairs?
avoid-all-contact-day.
what?
when dad's popping aspiring like popcorn, it's avoid-all-contact-day.
