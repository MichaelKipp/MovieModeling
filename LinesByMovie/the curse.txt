i have cramps. i can't believe i let you talk me into this.
come on, we've been double dating since the fourth grade.
yeah even then look what happened: michael mortenson kissed you and billy sullivan threw a worm at me.
well that's not going to happen tonight. george said carlton's a nice guy.
translation: a total geek.
anything's better than mark.
my shrink says he's not so bad.
your shrink always gives you bad advice. he only hears what you choose to tell him. mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he's never had a regular job.
he's a very talented musician.
every woman at some point has to date a musician. i wish you'd get rid of mark for good. every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
i guess i have a weakness for him. it's those big brown bambi eyes.
so don't look in his eyes.
i wonder what it's like being you. being noticed all the time.
people notice you frida.
so i asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. it's like the "bagger" system. you know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. or a three-bagger...
two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
he hasn't said one word to me.
maybe he's just shy.
my date always pays more attention to you than to me.
frida, i don't mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about pms around men.
sorry. it's just so bad lately. you're so lucky you never get pms.
i get a little bloated sometimes.
i'd kill for just a little bloated.
it all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
that many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
sorry about frida. she's been friends with jen forever.
what's with her? if they're not bleeding they're pmsing. if they're not pmsing, they're warning you about the impending doom. if you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
i'm lucky jen's not like that.
i don't believe in pms. women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
my brother has an answer to pms. a-s-s: abundant sperm syndrome. a man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman isn't givin' it to 'em, he's gotta get it elsewhere.
yeah and when your woman says you're an ass, say yes, i have abundant sperm syndrome.
how about i give you a make-over? you'll feel better about yourself. you're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.
you're just saying that.
do you really need these?
only to see.
can't you get contacts?
no, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
try to get through dinner without them. you have beautiful eyes.
he was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
yeah and when we're mad at each other we're out of sync. it only works if you're on good terms.
or if there's a full moon.
or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
the nielson's?
on your desk.
script coverage?
on your desk.
coffee and...
your desk.
that i'm a doormat of course. the shrink makes more notes.
oh, i see... interesting theory.
okay, just one more stop and you'll be all set. victoria's secret.
what do i need overpriced fancy underwear for? shouldn't a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
it's not about him seeing you in it. it's how you feel. you'll feel sexy in lingerie and it'll show. it's an inner thing.
i don't know.
there's a sale. it's such a nice place -- classical music, relaxing atmosphere. you deserve to pamper yourself. come on, it can't hurt.
where are all the mediums?
frida, grab that red one.
can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
and she got the medium.
even on sale that stuff's a fortune. i worked all week to pay for a bra.
i think she broke the skin.
what a bitch. you should see a doctor. that can be dangerous. george bit me once and i had to go to the emergency room.
george bit you?
i kind of asked him to. we were, you know... he got a little carried away...
a bite... where'd you get bitten?
at victoria's secret.
there was a sale.
i mean where on your body?
oh, on my wrist.
a dog at victoria's secret?
no, it was another woman.
how's the rest of your health?
good. except for pms.
pms. what symptoms are you experiencing?
it's hard to describe. i get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
that's just part of being a woman. diet and exercise should help. avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
what else is there?
and keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it's related to your period and not just in your head.
it's not just in my head.
i know.
so you're grant's secretary?
i do development for tv movies.
oh, a d-girl. you know... i have a really great idea for a screenplay.
you're kidding, really?
no, i'm serious. how about we have dinner and i tell you about it?
nah, i don't wanna break up with wanda, i just wanna see carmen too.
man, you're livin' dangerously. let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
you kiddin'? they try to get me drunk.
you're some catch lloyd.
hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? said some chick bit her at victoria's secret. bitches are outta control these days.
what, you got a date or somethin'?
since when do you care?
you look different. i mean you look good.
you never say that.
you do though. you look really... is that a wonderbra?
no.
look what you did!
oh my god, i'm sorry!
shit. and you're eating my burger? you don't eat meat.
i can't help it, it smells so good.
ouch that stings! damn, what am i going to do with my back like this?
worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
frida, you know you're it for me.
yeah right... you better go.
hey wait, i paid three bucks for that burger. you owe me...
you haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
i'm working on it...
why did gregory ask me out? i mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
maybe he likes you, ever think of that? it's good for you to go out -- get your mind off mark.
you're so lucky you have george and don't need to go on dates anymore.
what i really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "can i use your phone?" "how about a nightcap?" "i want to meet your cat." and my all-time favorite, the old standby, "i have to use your bathroom."
maybe they have to pee.
are you kidding? he might as well say, "can i date rape you?"
i never thought of it like that. i never know what to do on dates. do guys still pay?
they better. of course, trouble is, you never know what they'll expect for it. you gotta know what to order, and what you're willing to do. like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he's gonna feel like you owe him something.
where?
where? where do you think a mustache would be. look!
i don't see anything. maybe just a little.
holy shit, i'm a freak.
you are not frida, we all have a little hair there. i didn't even notice till you showed me. we can bleach that, it's no big deal.
hey, did you get contacts?
oh, my glasses! maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
you hungry?
starving.
man i'm starving too, i think i'll go for the surf and turf.
i'm not really hungry after all.
you said you're starving. come on, i can't stand a woman who won't eat.
so there i was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, "son, you got into harvard!" it took three of them to pull me back! frida keeps eating.
well, whattdaya think?
that's great. highly original.
i'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
hey, how about a little nightcap?
i'm really tired.
come on, didn't all that steak make you thirsty?
no. really, i'm... i don't feel well. i've got terrible pms.
they say sex is great for cramps.
well i have it worse than cramps. goodnight gregory.
what?
i really gotta pee.
you should have gone at the restaurant.
i didn't have to pee then.
my apartment's just such a mess.
that's okay. i just have to use the bathroom and then i'll leave.
oh come on. knock it off.
knock what off?
you don't have to pee.
yes i do have to pee!
you're just saying that to get into my apartment and then you're hoping that'll turn into something else.
i wouldn't mind doin' something else, but i do really have to pee.
uh huh. so pee.
so pee? here?
yeah. whip it out. you want me to see it -- that's what this is all about, right?
it's about gregory jameson. he's dead.
oh my god, what happened?
he was found a few blocks away.
torn apart. limb from limb. a bloody gruesome mess.
jesus christ she got her period. relax guys. it happens.
yeah, sorry. uh... gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
yes... i... we had dinner.
did he come home with you? did you go to his apartment?
no, it was our first date.
looks like it was your only date. unless you go to his funeral.
when's the last time you saw him?
we... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
a kiss? did you have sex with him?
no, i said it was our first date.
how the hell is that your business?
we're just trying to figure out what happened.
i wish i could help but last i saw gregory was outside my front door.
okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
you want her sheets?
we can just take this pillowcase.
we can get a warrant if you like.
no, take it.
he's dead? am i bad luck or what?
there you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
and he was ripped limb from limb?
i'm sure they were exaggerating.
why would they exaggerate?
to sound like big macho cops. he was probably just found with a knife in his back.
so did you do it?
did i kill him? of course not!
no, did you fuck him?
no. i don't think so.
you don't think so? you either did or your didn't.
i don't remember. we kissed at my door and next thing i knew i woke up with my period. alone.
did you get smashed or what? you have to eat if you're drinking. and not just those little salads.
i ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with gregory.
i guess you're off that vegetarian kick you've been on for ten years.
i couldn't stop eating steak. i felt out of control -- like i was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. i couldn't get enough. and then gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
what? why the hell did he do that?
he was trying to get into my apartment and... i know this sounds gross but i was so turned on. i grabbed him and kissed him!
and then?
i think i went in and fell asleep. i guess gregory walked home and got killed! i blacked out.
at least your pms is over.
and my bra finally fits again.
i thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
my vision got worse again.
are those mark's?
no, mark wears boxers. they must have been in the dryer already.
uh huh... good thing those cops didn't see that.
he was cute, huh? of course whenever i meet a guy, i'm wearing no make-up.
rule one: always wear make-up.
i wonder if he's married.
he wasn't wearing a ring. but you don't want to date a cop frida. they're so blue collar.
i didn't trust her. all that blood on the sheets. she may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. something's weird.
that dude was torn limb from limb. no way a woman like that could have done it. you never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
hell no, i'm not into that shit. the sight of blood makes me sick.
oh, so you decide to be a cop? seriously? you don't have sex with a woman cause she's on the rag?
no man. blood is not a turn on. you sure let that frida off the hook. you weren't even going to take the sheets. if i didn't know better, i'd think you liked her.
i can tell she's not a killer. you just don't like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
nah, man, i'm just saying, you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive.
gross, so this is mark's flesh? when did you see him?
um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
why didn't you tell me? you said you hadn't seen him for a month.
i'm sorry. i didn't want you to think i was still a doormat.
frida, i'm your friend. i'm not judging you... you didn't sleep with the creep did you?
how about a "man in jeopardy" story?
did you change your hair?
a little.
frida's sheets checked out fine. it was just her own blood. from her... you know.
i told you she was innocent.
hey, there was a lot of blood.
she was never a suspect lloyd. some animal must have done this.
i checked all the zoos. no missing animals. you think a pitbull?
maybe. what about all those hairs they found on his body?
waiting for dna tests. he was hairier than madonna in penthouse.
madonna's in penthouse?
back in the '80's. you didn't see the pictures? they were from before she got famous. she was hairy as hell. her pits, her bush.
hairy women are kind of sexy. women in their natural state.
what?
and you think i'm sick?
i can't read any more crap. these women are all victims.
yes, that's what we're looking for.
i think we should do something with strong female characters...
i'll make a note of that. put the coverage on my desk.
that bite healed up quickly. it's been about three weeks?
nearly four.
how have you been feeling?
okay, but i'm worried about the next pms bout. it's gotten worse. i'm not myself during it. i get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and i have more facial and body hair.
sounds all stress related. your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. you don't seem hairy to me. is that all?
i get crazy dreams and i black out.
diet and exercise, that's all there is. i'm not a big proponent of the pms craze, but there's a book my wife mentioned called "the pms diet," which may be helpful.
does she have pms?
now it's menopause. she's always hot. i gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. it's always something.
you busted me.
are you following me?
no... no... this is embarrassing. i was returning your pillowcase... and i saw you cross the street... and i sort of started following you. i just find you really intriguing. i don't know why.
intriguing?
i gotta get going. peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
at least let me give you this back. i washed it.
where'd you get the bike?
i'm kinda borrowing it. who's this, mr. date-guy?
being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
that's my ex. he's an asshole. in case you couldn't tell. i think he's been following me.
there's a lot of that going around.
you wanna get some coffee?
i'm trying to stay away from caffeine.
some decaf then? that was stupid. obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
no. really. i don't drink coffee anymore. i used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
okay well. maybe some other time. they continue walking together.
so what book did you buy?
oh, it's nothing.
no really, i love knowing what people read.
it's stupid.
i can forgive you a bestseller.
my mom used to get pms too.
used to? did it stop finally?
no, she died when i was twelve.
i'm sorry.
i've had time to get over it. she was killed by wolves they think.
oh my god, by wolves?
we lived in northern minnesota. she went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
i'm so sorry peter. gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
the weird thing is i've had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
i've read scripts about detectives, but never met one. must be wild.
sometimes it's frustrating. like this gregory jameson case. we don't even know what killed him. i'm putting together little details to see if we're missing something.
like what?
you know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you're in an accident? well this guy wasn't wearing any underwear.
a lot of people don't wear underwear.
yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
how about you? briefs or boxers?
briefs.
cool. i don't get guys who wear boxers. my ex wore boxers. i never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
me neither. that's why i wear briefs... so why did you and... mark break up?
he's bad news. he cheated on me, he insults me. now suddenly he gets jealous if i have a date.
i really gotta get going.
thanks for the walk. maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
yeah. maybe.
goodnight.
goodnight.
i don't think i've ever actually liked anyone i've dated before. peter even likes me without makeup.
hmmm. sounds suspicious.
i don't know much about him. how do you know if a guy is decent?
give him the tampon test.
what the hell is the tampon test?
you're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "i'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" if he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. if he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. but if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. then, while he's out...
what are those?
silver bullets. a collectors item. these are very valuable. they were melted down from a crucifix.
what are they for?
oh just my wolf paraphernalia. some people collect beanie babies... i collect silver bullets.
i'm a cop -- i notice everything. that drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet wasn't closed when i left...
okay, you busted me.
what's wrong?
oh, nothing's wrong. just... well don't you have your period?
my period? no.
i mean we can still... whatever... maybe i should get a towel?
no. no, i'm fine. maybe i should go. i mean... i don't want our first time to be like this.
frida, wait. don't go. we can just sleep. i just want to wake up with you.
i'm freaking out. i'm like an animal and totally out of control. my arms keep getting really hairy.
you have to stop being so self- critical frida.
i looked like an italian man!
how'd it go with the cop?
we almost slept together... and... then the hair started and i booked.
frida, this hair thing is all in your head. you're using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
it's just as well. i'm afraid of getting hurt again. mark seemed great at first too. i don't want to get too attached to peter and then find out he's a creep.
hey, carlton's in town -- come out with the three of us.
no he didn't. come on, i don't want to be alone with those two. all they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
okay. i guess so.
great. george is meeting carlton first for drinks. we can meet and go together. it'll be a blast.
come on, i've been working with frida. carlton won't even recognize her now. she's really coming out of her shell.
she's just so... pathetic.
she's just insecure. once you get to know her she's fabulous.
she'll talk about pms and stare at her salad.
i started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
you're just saying that.
what did he say?
i think he called you beautiful.
oh my god. i've never had that before. i've had guys say they want me to suck their dicks and gross stuff but no one's ever said "hey there beautiful."
guess you like those coyote ugly steaks now, huh?
sorry, don't mean to be wolfing down. i'm just starving.
don't apologize. it's great to see a woman really enjoying her food. i hate it when i buy a woman dinner and she won't even touch it.
no one i've run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.
maybe that bartender made it up. i mean i think coyotes are rather beautiful. maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. like someone who's conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
yeah that's like a three bagger. today a bag is also a condom, so now a three bagger can be a chick that's really hot. so hot you gotta put several condoms on to dull the senses.
charming carlton.
it is so hot in here.
bag means condom now? i can't keep up with the word "bag." it used to be "no, that's not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. but now "my bag" means "my fault."
i still thought it was a purse.
waiter! she needs more water.
can we get some service here?
you might want to tape your nipples down next time. it's really distracting.
i can't help it. my bra wouldn't even fit. i've been going to victoria's secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still i'm busting out. it's this pms.
geez, i wish i'd get it like that.
no you don't, believe me.
oh my god, look. my arms are so hairy!
no they're not.
yes they are! look how much more hair i have than you!
it's just cause mine is finer. a little bleach'll fix that.
i look like fuckin' chewbacca.
no way is that the same chick. the other one was a dog.
jennifer gave her a make-over.
looks like a helluva lot more than a make-over. was there surgery involved?
sorry i didn't recognize you earlier. you look so different.
i've changed a lot lately.
you shouldn't smoke. it'll kill you.
yeah yeah i know. smoking kills. i'll quit someday. doesn't it seem like all the cool people smoke?
no.
james dean, humphrey bogart...
yul brynner. they're all dead.
yeah but they looked cool...
what?
your lips look delicious.
wow your body's really hot.
i've been working out.
i mean body temperature. do you have a fever?
never felt better.
i wonder how frida and carlton are getting along?
carlton insisted on leaving with her. maybe he got lucky.
so now being with frida is lucky? i thought you said she was a flake.
it's for you. frida.
tell her i'm eating.
frida, this is a bad time. we're having sex and george actually answered the phone.
there is a man's arm in my bed.
jennifer. a severed arm. it's bloody and... i'm not sure but it may be carlton's.
you fucked carlton? see i told you he liked you.
no! not fucked him, i think i killed him.
please come over. i'm begging you. what should i do with the arm? should i call the cops or... peter?
frida, you're not making sense. i can't come over right now.
jennifer?
no it's mom.
mom!
we're worried about you. "60 minutes" was on same-sex couples.
what does that have to do with me?
you haven't mentioned dating anyone since mark and, well you're not a lesbian are you?
no, i'm not a lesbian. geez mom.
it's okay if you are, we just want to know. i don't want to be expecting grandchildren if...
oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. you following me again?
no. i was doing my laundry.
i'm sorry -- i'm on edge today.
was there anything in that washer?
no. nope, nothing in it.
you sure? it's my favorite shirt, mind if i check?
no! i... i checked when i put my stuff in. i always look through the washer first.
everything okay?
a man killed in central park.
so where's this infamous arm now?
i put it down the garbage disposal.
and what makes you think you killed a man?
because of pms, i get hairy, my nails turn into claws, i eat raw meat, i roam the city hunting for flesh. i've become a werewolf!
you're a pms werewolf. of course. frida, are you on drugs?
no, last night i think i chased carlton around as a wolf and killed him. i woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. and my throat hurts.
you're delusional. maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. and the severed arm... well i don't see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
it took me an hour to clean it up. that was not in my head!
maybe the blood was from your period like before.
i haven't gotten it yet.
frida, listen to yourself. if i said i was a werewolf, would you believe me?
i don't know. you have to take sammy. he's afraid of me.
i think i'm a werewolf.
let's explore this. what makes you feel you're a werewolf?
i ate a guy last night.
and how did you feel when you ate this guy?
i don't know. i don't remember doing it.
dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. you had sex last night and you feel guilty.
we didn't have sex.
you say you killed a man and don't remember it. couldn't you have had sex and not remember it? it's sexual. why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
cause i'm a fucking werewolf!!
you use the word "fucking." you're sexualizing things. stop berating yourself. it's okay to have sex.
i'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat i'm allergic to cause your friend's got pms?
it's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
you have some weird friends. what does her thinking she's a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
don't be stupid george. obviously if she's a werewolf, she can't be around a cat. she might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
oh great. what the fuck am i supposed to do?
take some allergy medicine.
you can't believe this bullshit.
she's my best friend. i gotta be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. i've been in some bad relationships and she's been there for me. she's lonely. if pretending she's a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
he was found nearly ripped to shreds in central park.
and he was missing an arm.
i still don't get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
we only live a few blocks apart.
this is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
okay lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
she's got a hidden pitbull. maybe she hired someone to kill them.
she's not a suspect. what is her motive? there's nothing, nothing connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
you take the cake lloyd. come on, she's not here. let's check out her psycho ex.
hello?
frida? i was worried to death about you. i've called you for two days. where have you been?
i've been here. what day is it?
tuesday. are you okay?
shit, i guess i missed work.
frida, carlton's dead.
oh no.
and he was missing an arm.
oh my god jennifer. i should go to confession.
relax. carlton was torn apart. no way could you have done that. maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
frida? i hear you talking. i know you're in there. let me in.
it's mark.
get rid of him!
okay, i gotta go.
i'm stopping by later. i'm worried about you. bye.
it's a matter of life and death.
this really isn't a good time.
come on frida, i'm not kidding. i'm totally fucked. let me in.
i did something stupid. i had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. it turned out to be money -- so i kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.
so pay them back and apologize.
these guys aren't the kind that'll take an apology. they're the kind that'll break my thumbs.
you think that story's gonna make me loan you money?
it's the truth. if you'd just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
somehow this winds up being my fault? you always blame me.
come on, i'm your biggest supporter.
my bra is my biggest supporter.
i just need a place to lay low for a few days. come on, i know you hate me but you can't wanna see me at the bottom of the east river?
mark.
yeah?
wow.
take your shower.
holy shit, i don't know.
did you get rid of mark?
i don't know... i'm spaced out... he was taking a shower... he must be still in there.
he's been here all night?
yeah, i guess. mark?
what happened to his tooth?
i should call the police. oh no peter. peter is the police!
don't call the police.
why not? there's been a murder.
first of all, you're my alibi. i told george i was with you last night.
what? why'd you do that?
there's kind of this guy i'm seeing.
you're cheating on george? jennifer, how could you?
how could i? i'm helping you clean up mark's remains and you ask how could i cheat on george?
you're right. it's just, i can't cover up a murder so george won't know you're cheating.
you say murder, but you have no idea what happened. you don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
i think i turned into a werewolf and killed him.
why the fuck would you do that?
i could smell another woman on him.
if you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. i'm glad he's dead.
that's a terrible thing to say. frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
okay, let's say that this is pms- related. you think those male cops are going to understand that? you'll either be locked up for murder or locked up in the looney bin. we have to keep this hidden until we figure it out ourselves.
nah, east village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
the park dude was missing an arm.
poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. and his eyes were open. that always bugs me out. do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
deal. and if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
yeah okay. i still say frida's involved. she's the last one to see two dudes alive...
she wasn't the last one to see them alive. whoever killed them was.
at least i finally saw the reason you couldn't get over mark.
you should have seen it erect.
you expecting someone?
no.
ignore it.
fuck it's the cops. peter saw me, now i have to let him in.
tell them you'll meet them outside.
uh.... hi!
frida, can we come in? we need to talk to you. it's important.
uh... the buzzer's broken. i'll be down in a second.
what the fuck are we going to do?
hide him.
i was thinking about becoming a cop myself. do you take a test or something or just sign up?
why would you want to be a cop?
i don't know, i guess the outfits are cool. and i want a big gun.
you heard about carlton fraser?
yes, jennifer told me. what does that have to do with me?
you had a date with carlton?
it wasn't a date. jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
seems you were the last to see carlton alive. and the last to see gregory alive.
what makes you think i was the last one?
he means the last that we know of.
this one walk you home too?
no. we left the restaurant, and... and i felt sick... so... so i took a cab home. alone.
you got a dog?
no, i have a cat.
how big?
see he was cheating from the get go.
he's been running money for the mafia.
no he's not. he's a courier. he picks up packages from the airport.
packages of money.
seems he's stolen money from them. he's desperate and our only lead.
one of our only leads... you had dates with both men right before they were killed.
no, no... but mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. maybe he kills men you date.
mark wouldn't hurt a fly.
but you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
still haven't figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. never seen anything like it.
no, why?
he was ripped to shreds also. in his apartment.
peter knows something.
well if he does, he didn't give you away. he must really like you.
spencer's the key here. frida is in no way associated with him. and her blood hasn't matched with any of the killings.
it's a bit farfetched that mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. this makes no sense.
it's like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
like a vampire or some shit?
i think i just got my period.
does that mean this whole thing is over?
probably for three weeks or so anyway. i'm not sure -- i don't get how it works.
let's do some research. i'll check the libraries. you surf the web.
you're such a good friend.
so are you. look, go about your life. act like nothing's wrong. we'll get to the bottom of this.
mr. grant. did you read that script i was talking about?
uh... yes. not for us. no woman in jeopardy. find me dr. quinn medicine woman. find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
no.
no?
no. i quit. take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
very well then. is that all?
frida. i was looking for you. you changing jobs?
yeah sort of. where's lloyd?
i need to talk to you. about us. frida... i... can i carry your box?
no, i got it. it's okay.
what happened?
what happened?
i thought we were starting something... and then... i know it's unorthodox, i mean with you being involved in the case and all.
i just don't know if i should be dating anyone right now.
yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
except mark of course.
what's that supposed to mean?
did i tell you i have the worst sense of humor and i make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
no, but thanks for the warning.
speaking of mark -- we've tried to track him down and there's no sight of him. vanished into thin air. i got a hunch he fled the country.
interesting possibility.
symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
peter keeps asking me out.
maybe you should go out with him. if you keep avoiding him he'll get suspicious. besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who's investigating you.
the thing is, i really like him. i finally meet a guy i really like and i'm a fuckin' werewolf.
we don't know you're a werewolf. it might never happen again. you have to get on with your life.
that's it? hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. she made us call her a different name. she'd say, "you're talking to betty now" and we'd leave the house for a few days.
this is a lot worse than "betty."
you can't mean that. i'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
no, my bite's a lot worse.
is it that funny?
no, it's just... no one's ever said that. and i thought if someone did ever say it, i'd have to say it first and then they'd sort of say "i love you too" cause they felt they had to after i'd said it.
is that how you feel?
like i had to say it? no, i wanted to say it.
you didn't say it.
i love you too.
what's with the squirt guns?
they're for my cat. i use them to train him not to rip up paper.
you know, i've never seen your cat.
i loaned him to jennifer. george moved out and she was lonely...
you think mafia hit?
hard to tell. looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. this case gets weirder by the minute.
it has to be frida. this makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
okay lloyd. first, no way does frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? third, she's the one in danger. she's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. fourth, i look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
and fifth, you're dating her.
what are you talking about?
i know. i followed you. to the zoo, to her house, to your house...
what the fuck are you following me for? i'm not a suspect here.
which brings up an interesting point. i wasn't following you. i was following the suspect. and you just happened to be there...
"paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." nothing about turning into a werewolf.
check out what i found.
this is from a scientist in france, madame sconce. "the original werewolves were females. they became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. my suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
great so all i have to do is fall in love? like i haven't tried that for the past 24 years.
"the female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." see i knew you never loved mark.
who is this madame sconce? let's find her and talk to her.
she died at age 34 in the 1800's. they thought she was crazy. she was banished from her town. seems her husband shot her.
guess she never found true love.
the weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
so... she was a werewolf. do you think we can believe all this?
what choice do we have?
so what do i do?
fall in love.
i think i already have.
your breasts feel larger.
they do? oh no...
no, it's a good thing. i like it. everything about you is great. i like how you don't shave your legs. women are so much sexier when they're natural.
i did shave... do i seem hairy? peter laughs.
no. but i don't mind hairy. are you okay?
i'm cleaning my stove.
you scared the shit out of me. i thought you were killing yourself.
i tried to kill myself -- earlier. it doesn't work. i think i need silver bullets. so i got depressed and when i'm depressed i clean.
you'll get through this. you were fine for over three weeks.
i'm just afraid i'll hurt peter. i think i love him.
remember what madame sconce said. if you love him he'll be fine.
but how do i know if i really love peter? and if he really loves me?
i guess you'll find out.
no. i can't take that chance. i'd rather kill myself.
no. i won't let you do that.
the werewolf always dies at the end. didn't you see "american werewolf in london?"
i think george knows.
about mark? carlton?
about benito.
did i kill a guy named benito?
no, he's the guy i'm having an affair with.
i thought you and george were getting married.
we were -- i was just so tempted... it was sort of a test. i think after sleeping with benito i know i want to be with george. but now george knows about benito and he doesn't want to be with me!
i wish i only had your problems.
sorry -- i shouldn't go on about myself at a time like this. are you sure you're going to be okay?
yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. then the pms should be over.
hello?
frida? you okay? look, i think i know what happened to mark. i want to help. i'm coming over.
no! don't come over. peter... i... i don't want to see you anymore. ever.
what? is there someone else?
yes, sort of. i mean no, not really.
yes or no? frida, can't you just be honest with me?
you at least owe me the truth.
you want the truth? remember i tried to tell you something the other day?
yes, your pms. frida i can deal with that.
no you can't. it... it gets so bad that i become a werewolf.
if you don't like me, just say so. you don't have to make up some bullshit like you're a werewolf.
i knew you wouldn't believe me! just go away. go very far away!
my girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
what makes her think that?
she says she's on the rag every time i get called in to investigate a murder.
so... they're on some cycle. the murders... gregory... then 28 days later... carlton.
and that was 28 days ago today.
did we get those dna tests back?
just this morning. animal hairs were found all over the victims.
what kind of animal?
can't figure out the species. similar to a wolf. they're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
go away. i might hurt you.
i'm not afraid. frida! i love you.
peter i love you too but...
i don't think you'll hurt me.
how do you know?
i don't think you would. no matter what form you take.
i can't take that chance... i couldn't live with myself if i did anything to you.
i have the silver bullets in case i need to protect myself. does that make you feel better?
be careful!
can't you bite me and then i'll be like you?
no. it doesn't work that way. men can't get pms. unfortunately.
i'm staying here with you tonight. there's no getting rid of me.
i knew you wouldn't kill me.
maybe we should have children. i don't think i'd kill the father of my child.
we can work this out. other couples have worse problems.
worse than this?
sure. cheating, lying. what's a little werewolf a few days a month? we can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
what about... those guys... i might have...
no way can anything be proved. all they have are some wolf hairs. no one believes in werewolves.
i'm so sorry... i... i couldn't help it. you know i didn't mean to... to do any of that.
i know. the important thing is that it stop.
i'm going to take a shower.
okay.
hello?
frida? you okay?
never been better. peter spent the night. i must really love him. he's still alive.
oh thank god. maybe this whole thing is really over.
god i hope so. hey can i call you later? peter's still here. he's in the shower.
sure. see ya.
here's a towel.
thanks.
