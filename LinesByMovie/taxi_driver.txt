no trouble with the hack bureau?

so why do you want to be a taxi driver?
i can not sleep nights.
there is porno theatres for that.
i know. i tried that.
so whatja do now?
i ride around nights mostly. subways, buses. see things. figur'd i might as well get paid for it.
we do not need any misfits around here, son.
you kiddin? who else would hack through south bronx or harlem at night?
you want to work uptown nights?
I will work anywhere, anytime. i know i can not be choosy.
how is your driving record?
clean. real clean.  as clean as my conscience.
listen, son, you gonna get smart, you can leave right now.
sorry, sir. i did not mean that.
physical? criminal?
also clean.
age?
twenty-six.
education?
some. here and there.
military record?
honorable discharge. may 1971.
you moonlightin?
no, i want long shifts.
we hire a lot of moonlighters here.
so i hear.
hell, we am not that much fussy anyway. there is always opening on one fleet or another.  fill out these forms and give them to the girl at the desk, and leave your phone number. you got to phone?
no.
well then check back tomorrow.
yes, sir.
why should it be grounded?
listen -- i mean i just saw the needle of the empire state building. you can not see it for the fog!
then it is a good guess it is grounded.
the empire state in fog means something, do not it? do you know, or do not you? what is your number, cabbie?
have you tried the telephone?
there is not time for that. in other words, you do not know.
no.
well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? pull over right here.  why do not you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog!
what is your name? my name is travis.
awh, come off it, pal.
no, I am serious, really...
ya want me to call da boss? huh? that what you want?
no, no, it is alright. I will have a big coca-cola -- without ice -- and a large buttered popcorn, and...  ...some of them chocolate covered malted milk balls... and ju-jukes, a box. they last.
we do not have ju-jukes. we do not have coca-cola. we only got royal crown cola.
that is fine.
that is a dollar forty-seven.
tom, come here a moment.  i think this canvas report is about ready to go out. check it out with andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  and do not forget to add the new photo releases.
the senator's white paper is almost ready, bets. should we wait for that?
andy usually just sends those to the national media. the local press does not know what to do with a position paper until upi and ap tell them anyway.
i think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. push the issues.
first push the man, then the issue. senator palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
you forgot "sexy".
no, i did not forget "sexy".
just did not get around to it, huh?
oh, tom, please.
well, for christsakes, you sound like you are selling... i do not know what... cars... not issues.
have you ever wondered why cbs news has the highest ratings?
more people watch it.
alright, forget it if you are not going to be serious,
no, c'mon, I am listening. i was just...
just what?
kidding around... you know, fun.
maybe if you would try thinking once in a while, you would get somewhere.
with who?
alright, now. you want to know why cbs has the highest ratings? you think their news is any different from nbc, abc? it is all the same news. same stories. same order usually. what, you thought they had good news for people, right? you thought that is why people watched cbs? I will tell you why people watch cbs. cronkite. the man. you got it? not the news, not the issues, the man. if walter cronkite told people to eat soap, they would do it. we are selling cars, goddamn it.
well, if cronkite's so great, why do not we run him instead?
that is the last. the finish. period. some people can learn. some people can't. and you wonder why we never get serious --
sure we could run him. you realize he is already head of his block association.
have you been noticing anything strange?
no, why?
why is that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
what taxi driver?
that taxi driver. the one that is been sitting here.
how long has he been there?
i do not know -- but it feels like a long time.
first she did her make-up. you know, i hate it when they do that. i mean she does the whole works, the mascara, the eye-shadow, the lipstick, the rouge...
not rouge. blush-on, they call it.
the kind with a brush.
travis.
hey wizard.
yeah, that is blush-on. my wife uses it,
ask travis. he is the ladies man.
well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. and then the spray perfume. you know, the real sweat kind -- and, on top of that, get this, right when we are crossing the tri-boro bridge -- she changes her pantyhose!
no.
yeah.
could you see anything?
well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. but it was pretty obvious what she was doing. i mean, christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
what did you do?
threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out -- what do you think!  what do i have to do? draw you a picture?
yeah.
what was i supposed to do? i was watching in the rear view. you know, just checkin' traffic.  so howsit?
some fleet driver for bell just got cut up. just heard it on the radio.
stick up?
sure. what do you think? she wanted to get out of the cab. i said "look, you are in the middle of the fucking bridge..."
you said that?
well, i said, "lady, please, we are on a bridge..."
and what happened?
she stayed in the cab, what is she going to do? but she stiffed me. a real skunk.
a real skunk.
yeah. we went to harvard together.
we call him dough-boy cause he likes the dollars. he will chase a buck straight into jersey.
look who is talking?  who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour?
so howsit?
some fleet driver for bell just got cut up. just heard it on the radio.
stick up?
no, just some crazy fucker. cut half his ear off.
where.
in the jungle. 122nd.
you run all over town, do not you, travis?
fuckin' mau mau land, that is what it is.
huh?
i mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
i have.
you carry a piece? you need one?
nah.  i suppose not.
well, you ever need one, i know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal. lotsa shit around.
the cops and company raise hell they find out.
truck drivers bring up harlem specials that blow up in your hand. but this guy do not deal no shit. just quality. if you ever need anything, i can put you in touch.
for a fee.
for a fee.
i never use mine. but it is a good thing to have. just as a threat.
well, if there is this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. and I am going to hustle 'em.
what ya gonna do with all that money, dough-boy?
support my kids. can you dig it?  nice to meet ya, travis. so long, wizard. say hello to malcolm x for me.
try holding the match like this.
this is gotta be a game, right?
this i gotta see.
ouch!
oh, are you all right?
I am great. always set my fingers on fire. if you want to see another trick. i do this thing with my nose.
no. i just wanted to see if you could light it that way. the guy at the newsstand can.
ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, mr. asbestos...
he happens to be missing fingers. i first noticed when --
is he italian?
no, why?
you sure he is not italian?
he is black, ok?
well, if he had been italian, they could have been shot off. sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, if they blow a job or something.
as i said, he is not italian. besides, i thought they just killed them.
do not be naive. they can not kill everybody. they have different punishments for different things. like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. it is symbolic.
why do not they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
i do not know. maybe they do not leave a canary. do not be technical. what I am saying is if this newsstand guy's italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he is a thief.
first, he is not italian. second he is not a thief. i noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. two of his fingers are missing. just stubs. like they were blown away. i was putting my change in my purse when i saw him get out a cigarette. i could not help watching. i was dying to see how he would light it.
with the other hand, right?
no, stupid. with the stubs. that is the whole point.
i know that guy. his hand looks like a paw. an old black guy, the newsstand at --
no, this is young -- well, I am never sure how old black people are -- but, anyway, he is not old. that is for sure.
show me how he did that again.
is that so?  but what do you think of charles palantine?
who mam?
charles palantine. the man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
oh, i think he is a wonderful man. make a great, great president.
you want to canvass?
yes, mam.
well, that is not exactly what the senator has proposed. you might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: office work, filing, poster hanging.
I am a good worker, betsy mam, a real good worker.
if you talk to tom, he will assign you to something.
if you do not mind, mam, I would rather work for you.
well, we are all working tonight.
well, betsy mam, i drive a taxi at night.
well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
if you do not mind, mam, I would be mighty pleased if you would go out and have some coffee and pie with me.
why?
well, betsy mam, i drive by this place here in my taxi many times a day. and i watch you sitting here at this big long desk with these telephones, and i say to myself, that is a lonely girl. she needs a friend. and I am going to be her friend.
i do not know...
it is just to the corner, mam. in broad daytime. nothing can happen. I will be there to protect you.
all right.  all right. I am taking a break at four o'clock. if you are here then we will go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
oh, i appreciate that, betsy mam. I will be here at four of the clock exactly.  and... ah... betsy...
yes?
my name is travis.
thank you, travis.
we have signed up 15,000 palantine volunteers in new york so far. the organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
i know what you mean. I have got the same problems. i just can not get things organized. little things, i mean. like my room, my possessions. i should get one of those signs that says, "one of these days I am going to get organezizied"
travis, i never ever met anybody like you before.
i can believe that.
where do you live?
oh, uptown. you know. some joint. it am not much.
so why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
i had a regular job for a while, days. you know, doin' this, doin' that. but i did not have anything to do at night. i got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. so i decided to works nights. it am not good to be alone, you know.
after this job, I am looking forward to being alone for a while.
yeah, well...  in a cab you get to meet people. you meet lotsa people. it is good for you.
what kind of people?
just people people, you know. just people.  had a dead man once.
really?
he would been shot. i did not know that. he just crawled into the back seat, said "west 45th street" and conked out.
what did you do?
i shut the meter off, for one thing. i knew i was not going to get paid. then i dropped him off at the cop shop. they took him.
that is really something.
oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. especially when the moon's out.
the moon?
the full moon. one night i had three or four weirdos in a row and i looked up and, sure enough, there it was -- the full moon.
com'on, travis. it is not that bad. i take lots of taxis.
i know. i could have picked you up.
huh?
late one night. about three. at the plaza.
three in the morning? i do not think so. i have to go to bed early. i work days. it must have been somebody else.
no. it was you. you had some manila folders and a pink bag from saks.
you are right! now i remember! it was after the western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. the next day i was completely bushed. it was unbelievable.
if it was not for a drunk i would have picked you up. he wanted to go to the dmz.
the dmz?
south bronx. the worst. i tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so i had to take him. that is the law. otherwise i would have picked you up.
that would have been quite a coincidence.
you would be surprised how often you see the same people, get the same fare. people have patterns. they do more or less the same things every day. i can tell.
well, i do not go to the plaza every night.
i did not mean you. but just ordinary people. a guy i know -- dough-boy -- met his wife that way. they got to talking. she said she usually caught the bus so he started picking her up at the bus stop, taking her home with the flag up.
that is very romantic. some of your fares must be interesting. see any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  i got this guy who makes lasers. not regular lasers, not the big kind. little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. like a ray gun. zap.
what hours do you work?
i work a single, which means there is no replacement -- no second man on the cab. six to six, sometimes eight. seventy-two hours a week.
you mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
sometimes 76 or 80. sometimes i squeeze a few more hours in the morning. eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
you must be rich.
it keeps ya busy.
you know what you remind me of?
what?
that song by kris kristofferson, where it is said "like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction".
I am no pusher, betsy. honest. i never have pushed.
i did not mean that, travis. just the part about the contradiction.
oh. who was that again?
the singer?
yeah. yes. i do not follow music too much.
kris kristofferson.
say, are not you charles palantine, the candidate?
yes i am.
well, I am one of your biggest supporters. i tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you.
why, thank you travis.
I am sure you will win, sir. everybody i know is going to vote for you.  i was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy.
I will tell you, travis, I have learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of general motors.
travis, what single thing would you want the next president of this country to do most?
i do not know, sir. i do not follow political issues much.
there must be something...
well, he should clean up this city here. it is full of filth and scum. scum and filth. it is like an open sewer. i can hardly take it. some days i go out and smell it then i get headaches that just stay and never go away. we need a president that would clean up this whole mess. flush it out.
i know what you mean, travis, and it is not going to be easy. we are going to have to make some radical changes.
damn straight.
nice talking to you, travis.
thank you, sir. you are a good man, sir.
you did not have to spend your money -- ?
he'll, what else can i do with it all?
travis, you have not even played the record?
yeah, well my stereo player is broke. but I am sure the record is ok.
your stereo broke? god, i could hardly stand that. i live on music.
i do not follow music much. I would like to though.  honest.
so you have not heard this record yet?
no.  i thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
what are you doing?
i bought a couple of tickets.
but this is a porno movie.
no, these are the kind that couples go to. they are not like the other movies. all kinds of couples go. honest. I have seen them.
damn.
what is wrong?
i forgot to get the coca-cola.
where are you going?
I am leaving.
what do you mean?
these are not the kind of movies i go to.
well, i do not follow movies too much...
you mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
this is sort of high class...
i mean porno movies.
well... mostly...
my god!
we can go to another movie if you like, i do not care. i got money. there is plenty...
...there's plenty of movies around here. i have not seen any of them, but I am sure they are good.
no, travis. you are a sweet guy and all that, but i think this is it. I am going home.
you mean you do not want to go to a movie?  there is plenty of movies around here.
no, i do not feel so good. we are just two very different kinds of people, that is all.
huh?
it is very simple. you go your way, I will go mine. thanks anyway, travis.
but... betsy...
I am getting a taxi.
what about the record?
keep it.
can i call you?
20 bucks?
yeah. hey thanks. that is real nice, travis.
you got a .44 magnum?
that is an expensive gun.
i got money.
some of these guns are like toys, but a smith and wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. nothing beats quality.  you interested in an automatic?
i want a .32. revolver. and a palm gun. that .22 there.
that is the colt .25 -- a fine little gun. do not do a lot of damage, but it is as fast as the devil. handy little gun, you can carry it almost anywhere. I will throw it in for another $125.
how much for everything.
the .32's $150 -- and you are really getting a good deal now -- and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty- five for four pieces and a holster. hell, I will give you the holster, we will make it seventy-five and you have got a deal -- a good one.
how much to get a permit to carry?
well, you are talking big money now. I would say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. the way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. you see, i try not to fool with the small-time crap. too risky, too little bread. say 6 g's, but if i get the permit it will be as solid as the empire state building.
nah, this'll be fine.
you can not carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
is there a firing range around?
sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. they will charge you, but there will not be any hassle.
you in nam? can not help but notice your jacket?
huh?
vietnam? i saw it on your jacket. where were you? bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there.
yeah. i was all around. one hospital, then the next.
it is hell out there all right. a real shit-eatin' war. I will say this, though: it is bringing a lot of fantastic guns. the market's flooded. colt automatics are all over.
they would never get me to go back. they would have to shoot me first.  you got anything to carry these in?
you like ball games?
huh?
i can get you front and center. what do you like? i can get you mets, knicks, rangers? hell, i can get you the mayor's box.
nah. i am not interested.
...he called up the dispatcher last night. charlie mccall, our dispatcher...
one-ball mccall?
that is the guy. eddie calls him up and says, "hey, what do you want me to do. I am over here at poly prep. i got a girl in the back and she does not have the fare. she wants me to come in back and collect. what should i do?
fuckin' one-ball.
and the kid says, "yeah. she is about 19, good-lookin." mccall says, "what can i tell you?"
what is the action around?
slow.
wiz?
yeah?
look, ah, we never talked much, you and me...
yeah?
i wanted to ask you something, on account you have been around so long.
shoot. they do not call me the wizard for nothing.
well, i just, you know...
things got ya down?
real down.
it happens.
sometimes it gets so i just do not know what I am going to do. i get some real crazy ideas, you know? just go out and do somethin.
the taxi life, you mean.
yeah.
i know.
like do anything, you know.
travis, look, i dig it. let me explain. you choose a certain way of life. you live it. it becomes what you are. I have been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. still do not own my own cab. i guess that is the way i want it.  you see, that must be what i am.
look, a person does a certain thing and that is all there is to it. it becomes what he is. why fight it? what do you know? how long you been a hack, a couple months? you are like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
that is just about the dumbest thing i ever heard, wizard.
what do you expect, bertrand russell? I have been a cabbie all my life, what do i know?  i do not even know what you are talking about.
neither do i, i guess.
you fit in. it is lonely, it is rough at first. but you fit in. you got no choice.
yeah. sorry, wizard.
do not worry, killer. you will be all right.  i seen enough to know.
thanks.
betsy, come over here a moment.
what is it? I am busy.
just follow me.
no, i do not think so.  that is someone else.
now look more closely. look around the eyes and chin. see? see there?
are you a secret service man?
why do you ask?
I have seen a lot of suspicious-looking people around here today.
who?
oh, lots. i do not know where they all are now. there used to be one standing over there.
is it hard to get to be a secret service man?
why?
i kinda thought i might make a good one. I am very observant.
oh?
i was in the army too.  and I am good with crowds.
is that so?
what kind of guns do you guys use? .38's?
look, um, if you give me your name and address, we will send you the information on how to apply.
you would, huh?
sure.
my name is henry krinkle -- that is with a "k." k-r-i-n-k-l-e. i live at 13 1/2 hopper avenue, fair lawn, new jersey. zip code 07410.  got that?
sure, henry. i got it all. we will send you all the stuff all right.
great, hey. thanks a lot.
hello.
you looking for some action?
well... i guess so.
all right.  you see that guy over there?  his name is sport. go talk to him. I will wait here.
here, officer, take me in. I am clean. i did not do it. got a ticket once in jersey. that is all. honest, officer.
your name sport?
anything you say, officer.
I am no cop.  i want some action.
i saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
shit.
take it or leave it.
I am no cop.
well, if you are, it is entrapment already.
I am hip.
funny, you do not look hip.
why you hang around with them greasers?
a girl needs protection.
yeah. from the likes of them.
it is your time mister. fifteen minutes am not long.  that cigarette burns out, your time is up.
what is your name?
easy.
that am not much of a name.
it is easy to remember. easy lay.
what is your real name?
i do not like my real name.
what is your real name?
iris.
that is a nice name.
that is what you think.
why? who are you?
i drive a taxi. you tried to get away one night. remember?
no.
you tried to run away in my taxi but your friend -- sport -- would not let you.
i do not remember.
it do not matter. I am going to get you outta here.
we better make it, or sport'll get mad. how do you want to make it?
i do not want to make it. i came here to get you out.
you want to make it like this?
can not you listen to me? do not you want to get out of here?
why should i want to get out of here? this is where i live.
but you are the one that wanted to get away. you are the one that came into my cab.
i musta been stoned.
do they drug you?
oh, come off it, man.
listen...
do not you want to make it?  can not you make it?
fuck it! fuck it! fuck it! fuck it! fuck it! fuck it! fuck it!
you can do it in my mouth.
do not you understand anything?
do you understand why i came here?
i think so. i tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
do not you want to go?
i can leave anytime i want.
but that one night?
i was stoned. that is why they stopped me. when I am not stoned, i got no place else to go. they just protect me from myself.
well, i tried.
i understand, mister. it means something, really.
can i see you again?
that is not hard to do.
no, i mean really. this is nothing for a person to do.
sure. all right. we will have breakfast. i get up about one o'clock. tomorrow.
well tomorrow noon there is a... i got a...
well, you want to or not?
o.k. it is a date. I will see you here, then.
...and after that sport and i just started hanging out...
where is home?
where?
pittsburgh.
i am not ever been there, but it do not seem like such a bad place.
why do you want me to go back to my parents? they hate me. why do you think i split? there am not nothin there.
but you can not live like this. it is hell. girls should live at home.
did not you ever hear of women's lib?
god, you are square.
at least i do not walk the streets like a skunk pussy. i do not screw and fuck with killers and junkies.
who is a killer?
that fella "sport" looks like a killer to me.
he never killed nobody. he is a libra.
huh?
I am a libra too. that is why we get along so well.
he looks like a killer.
i think cancer's make the best lovers. my whole family are air signs.
he shoots dope too.
what makes you so high and mighty? did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. you do not get eyes like that from...
he is worse than an animal. jail's too good for scum like that.
rock music died in 1970, that is what i think. before that it was fantastic. i can tell you that. everybody was crashing, hanging out at the fillmore. me and my girlfriend ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? it was unbelievable. rock stars everywhere. that airplane -- that is my group, man. all libras. but now everybody's split or got sick or busted. i think I will move to one of those communes in vermont, you know? that is where all the smart ones went. i stayed here.
i never been to a commune. i do not know. i saw pictures in a magazine, and it did not look very clean to me.
why do not you come to a commune with me?
me? i could never go to a place like that.
why not?
i... i do not get along with people like that.
you a scorpion? that is it. you are a scorpion. i can tell.
besides, I have got to stay here.
why?
I have got something important to do. i can not leave.
what is so important?
i can not say -- it is top secret. I am doing something for the army. the cab thing is just part time.
you a narc?
do i look like a narc?
yeah.
god, i do not know who is weirder, you or me.
what are you going to do about sport and that old bastard?
just leave'em. there is plenty of other girls.
you just going to leave 'em?
what should i do? call the cops?
cops do not do nothin.
sport never treated me bad, honest. never beat me up once.
you can not leave 'em to do the same to other girls. you should get rid of them.
how?
i do not know. just should, though.  somebody should kill 'em. nobody'd miss 'em.
god. i know where they should have a commune for you. they should have a commune for you at bellevue.
I am sorry, iris. i did not mean that.
you are not much with girls, are you?
well, iris, i look at it this way. a lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. and i figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. and they hate it. so i figure the best i can do for them is not bother them at all. so i do not say a thing. i pretend I am not even there. i figure they will understand that and appreciate me for it.
do you really think i should go to the commune?
i think you should go home, but otherwise i think you should go. it would be great for you. you have to get away from here. the city's a sewer, you got to get out of it.
sure you do not want to come with me?
i can't. otherwise, i would.
i sure hate to go alone...
I will give you the money to go. i do not want you to take any from those guys.
you do not have to.
i want to -- what else can i do with my money?  you may not see me again -- for a while.
what do you mean?
my work may take me out of new york.
