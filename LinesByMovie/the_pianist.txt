hello.
i came specially to meet you today. i love your playing, but what a day to choose.
who are you?
my name's dorota, I am jurek's sister. oh! you are bleeding.
it is nothing.
thank god - wladek! you are wounded.
it is a little cut, nothing.
I have been worried sick.
what did i tell you?
what are you doing?
they bombed us, we are off the air.
warsaw's not the only radio station.
pack, darling, get your things, pack.
where are we going?
out of warsaw.
out of warsaw. where?
and what do you think you will do while you are setting up a new line of defence? wander round lugging your suitcases?
pack, wladek, there is no time.
I am not going anywhere.
no, no, no, I am staying put. if I am going to die, i prefer to die at home.
god forbid!
mama, that was a great dinner.
it certainly was.
and suppose they take the table away?
what d'you mean, take the table away?
the germans go into jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything.
do they?
no, no. listen, I have been thinking --
that makes a change.
you know what we do? we use psychology.
we use what?
we leave the money and the watch on the table. and we cover it like this.  in full view. the germans will search high and low, i promise you, they will never notice it.
of course they will notice it. but look--  this is a good place for something.
a good place for what?  he is insane!
just shut up.
will i still be able to play?
let's find out.
jurek? wladek szpilman.
wladek! how are you?
fine, we are fine, thank you, and you?
fine, we are fine in the circumstances. but i can guess what you have called about. there is nothing we can do; they will not reopen the station--
yes, i know, but jurek, jurek...
...not even music, nothing, no radios for the poles. but I am sure you will find work, wladek, a pianist like you.
maybe, maybe not, but, jurek, do not be offended, i did not call to discuss my future career.
i nagged jurek for weeks and weeks. and at last he gave in and said, 'all right, come with me tomorrow,' and so i came and they bombed the station.
you know something? meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
really?
yes!  it was...it was unforgettable.
I have always loved your playing, mr. szpilman.
wladek, please.
no one plays chopin like you.
oh, mr szpilman, you are quite... quite wonderful.
wladek, please.
let me see this.
does not it say we have to provide these armbands ourselves? where will we get them?
have you seen this?
what, I am working, what?
but...they will not get all of us... we'll...it's too small...there's four hundred thousand of us in warsaw!
no. three hundred and sixty thousand, so it will be easy.
dorota!
i did not want to come, i did not want to see all this, but i could not stop myself.
how are you doing?
fine, no, not really, they arrested my cousin, but jurek says they will let him out.  this is disgraceful.
do not worry, it will not last long.
that is what i said, it is so - it is too absurd!
I will see you...soon.
to tell you the truth, i thought it would be worse.
how will we sleep?
you sell anything?
just one. dostoevsky. the idiot. three zlotys.
that is better than yesterday.
three lousy zlotys. and there are people here making millions.
i know.
you do not know, believe me. they bribe the guards. the guards turn a blind eye. they are bringing in cartloads, food, tobacco, liquor, french cosmetics, and the poor are dying all around them and they do not give a damn.
what is this about?
sit down, have tea, I will start lunch when the girls get back.
we are recruiting.
who is recruiting?
do not be clever with me, henryk. I have come here as a friend. they are bringing jews in from all over the country. soon there'll be half a million people in the ghetto. we need more jewish police...
oh? more jewish police? you mean you want me to wear a cap like yours, beat up jews with my truncheon and catch the gestapo spirit. i see!
someone is got to do it, henryk.
but why me? i thought you only recruited boys with rich fathers. look at my father, look at us, i mean...
yes, I am looking at you and that is why I am here. your whole family can have a better life. you want to go on struggling for survival, selling books on the street?
yes, please.
I am doing you people a favour. and what about you, wladek? you are a great pianist. and we have got an excellent police jazz band. they would welcome you with open arms. join us. you have got no work...
I am sorry, mr wladek, he wants you to stop.
who wants me to stop?
ah, here. today's news from the other side.
you are amazing, jehuda.
no, I am a socialist. i have brothers everywhere. they bring me news and food. we care about our fellow human beings. workers of the world unite.
so, what is the news?
the germans are advancing on kharkhov.
i do not know why i come here every evening, it is always such bad news.
bad news, you crazy? you have no world view, wladek, that is your trouble. the news could not be better. the moment hitler invaded russia, i knew we would be all right. remember napoleon. same business. the germans will freeze to death, please god.
jehuda, give me something to do.
you are an artist, wladek, you keep people's spirits up. you do enough.
but i want to help, i want to.
you are too well known, wladek. and you know what? you musicians do not make good conspirators. you are too...too musical.
there are notices going up. the city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
there are always notices going up.
five hundred. you know how many people on average read one copy? twenty.  that makes ten thousand readers. these will start the uprising. majorek hides them in his underpants. and leaves them in toilets.
toilets?
and, please, tonight, for once, i do not want anything bad talked about. let's enjoy our meal.
okay, then I will tell you something funny. you know who i mean by dr. raszeja.
henryk, i said nothing bad.
what is the matter with you all? have you lost your sense of humour?
it is not funny.
well, you know what is funny? you are funny with that ridiculous tie.
what are you talking about, my tie? what is my tie got to do with anything? i need the tie for my work.
boys, boys...
your work, yes, playing the piano for all the parasites in the ghetto, they do not give a damn about people's sufferings, they do not even notice what is going on around them!
for what? for my tie?
american jews, and there is lots of them, what have they done for us? what do they think they are doing? people here are dying, have not got a bite to eat. the jewish bankers over there should be persuading america to declare war on germany!
what is happened?
oh my god, it is terrible, you have got to do something, oh my god!
calm down, what, what is it?
they are hunting people on the streets. they have picked up henryk.
henryk's in there.
i have not seen him.
believe me, they have picked him up.
tough luck.
can you help?
oh, you need me now, yes, now you need me!
can you help us?
it costs.
I have no money.
then there is nothing i can do. he should have joined us when i gave him the chance..
yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
who told you?
people i know. they said you are an important man.
you go to heller, did i ask you to talk to him?
you are out, are not you?
did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
i did not grovel, i asked him to help.
what did you pay him?
pay him? with what? with what could i pay him? every zloty i earn we spend on food!
i can look after myself!
they were taking you away.
it is nothing to do with you. it is me they wanted, not you. why do you interfere in other people's business?
you are mad, that is your trouble, you are mad.
that is also my business.
what is the matter? are you sick?
hungry.
what is that mean, no employment certificate?
you have to have an employment certificate to work for one of the german firms in the ghetto, otherwise...
otherwise what?
you will be deported.
i thought you would be off on tour, playing london, paris, new york?
not this week.
i have to say you look terrible. what is the trouble?
you have heard the rumours they are going to resettle us in the east?
rumours, rumours, you take it all too much to heart, wladek.
I have been trying to get a certificate of employment for my father. I have managed to get certificates for me and the rest of the family but i need one more for my father. I have been trying all the firms, the shops...
why did not you come to me?
i did not know you were in the certificate business.
I am not, but majorek is.
can you help? I have no money...
please, do not insult us.  can you do something for him?
I am sorry, i did my best, i thought the certificates would save us all.
stop it, wladek.
what are you reading?
'if you prick us, do we not bleed? if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?'
very appropriate.
yes, that is why i brought it.
halina?
what?
funny time to say this.
what?
wish i knew you better.
thanks.
why are you here, mr. wladek?
it is like this... i...we...all of them.
someone you know?
yes.
a beauty. who is she?
a singer. her husband's an actor. i knew them well. good people. I would like to talk to her.
do not forget, mr. wladek, they hang them for helping jews.
how long have you been here?
since last night. i was pleased to see you.
they are going to start the final resettlement now. we know what it means. we sent someone out. zygmunt. a good man. his orders were to follow the trains out of warsaw. he got to sokolow. a local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to treblinka. he said every day freight trains carrying people from warsaw forked to treblinka and returned empty. no transports of food are ever seen on that line. and civilians are forbidden to approach the treblinka station. they are exterminating us. will not take them long. we are sixty thousand left. out of half a million. mostly young people. and this time we are going to fight. we are in good shape. we are organised. we are prepared.
if you need help...
have a favour to ask. i want to get out of here.
it is easy to get out, it is how you survive on the other side that is hard.
i know. but last summer, i worked for a day in zelazna brama square. i saw someone i knew. a singer. her husband's an actor. they are old friends.  I have written their names down. and their address. if they are still there. janina godlewska and andrzej bogucki. good people. majorek, you go into the town every day. would you try and make contact? ask them if they would help me get out of here?
i tried your friends. they are not at that address any more.  but.
you made contact?
be ready to leave in two days' time. same place as last night.
it is not going to be very comfortable.
I will be fine.
you will have to stay here until tomorrow afternoon.
must feel better this side of the wall.
yes, but sometimes I am still not sure which side of the wall I am on.
here.
puppydog, what d'you mean, you forgot?
what d'you think i mean, kitten? i forgot, that is what i mean.
you know what? you treat me like dirt!
i treat you like dirt because you are dirt.
pig!
cow!
pig!
bitch!
dirty pig!
you are a dirty pig!
takes one to know one! pig!
if i play like an angel, why do not you listen?
i was listening, kitten.
liar, you fell asleep. pig!
no one thought they would hold out so long.
should never have come out. i should have stayed there, fought with them.
wladek, stop that. it is over now. just be proud it happened. my god, did they put up a fight.
yes, so did the germans.
they are in shock. they did not expect it. nobody expected it. jews fighting back? who would have thought?
yes, but what good did it do?
what good? wladek, I am surprised at you. they died with  dignity, that is what good it did. and you know something else?  now the poles will rise. we are ready. we will fight, too. you will see.
get your things together, you have to leave!
what is happened?
I am on the run!
what is happened?
the gestapo found our weapons. they have arrested janina and andrzej. they are bound to find out about this place, too - you must get away at once.
where do you want me to go?  look at me. no, no, I am not leaving. can not i take my chances here?
that is your decision.  but when they storm the flat, throw yourself out of die window - do not let them get you alive. i have poison on me, they will not get me alive either!
wladyslaw szpilman.
dorota.
come in! come in!
sit.
I am sorry - i was given this address. I am looking for a mr--  -- a mr dzikiewicz.
michal dzikiewicz. he is my husband.
i need help.
he will be back before curfew.
I have been in hiding. i need somewhere to stay.
he will be here soon.
how long have you been married?
just over a year.
and how is yurek?
dead.
when is your baby due?
christmas.  this is not a good time to have children. but then...
this is my husband. wladyslaw szpilman. marek gebczynski sent him.
oh, yes. i remember.
you do not remember me, mr. szpilman?
no, i do not think so?
warsaw radio. i was a technician. i saw you almost every day.
sorry, i do not remember.
does not matter. you have nothing to worry about. I will visit often.
you do not want to worry about that. my grandfather was jilted by his girl friend when he got jaundice.  in my opinion, jaundice is not very serious. drink up.
why did not you come sooner? it is been over two weeks.
I am going to get a doctor.
you can't, it is too dangerous.
I will get dr luczak, we can trust him.
dorota, do not be ridiculous, he is a pediatrician.
he is still a doctor.
what the hell are you doing?
i was... i was trying to open this tin.
where do you live?
what is your work?
i am... i was a pianist.
a pianist.
where are you hiding?
in the attic.
show me.
what is all that gunfire?
the russians. on the other side of the river.  all you have to do is hang on for a few more weeks.
what is happening?
we are getting out.
are the russians here?
not yet.
i do not know how to thank you.
do not thank me. thank god. it is his will that we should survive. well. that is what we have to believe.
what about you?
I have got another one.  warmer.  what will you do when it is all over?
I will play the piano again. on polish radio.
tell me your name. I will listen out for you.
szpilman.
szpilman.  good name for a pianist.
