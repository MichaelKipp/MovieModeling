did max mention anything about any jobs?
what about boxing?
what about it?
what are you saying?
you said if you did not have a winning record after eleven fights, you would talk to max.
so?
so, it was a draw.
yeah, I am 5-5 and 1.
so, it is not a winning record.
it is not losing record.
that is not what you said. you said if you did not have a winning record --
do not be shitty.
how am i being shitty?
do not be shitty.
i would not keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
I am not going to bring it up to him.
of course i do not want you to bring it up to him... but if it comes up...
I will page you.
yeah. page me. you know the number?
yeah. i know the number.
cause if you do not know the number, i can page you with the number so you will have the number.
i know the number.
I will page you with the number. I will see you later. what time you done?
i got no idea.
ask if he said anything to her.
i will.
I will page you with the number.
bye.
honey?
where were you?
so, what kind of gig is this?
easy night. bachelor party. can we give wendy a ride?
no. what kind of bachelor party?
the easy kind. they are young and rich and well mannered.
oh my god. what happened?
a draw. what makes you think they are well mannered?
bobby, this is a plumb gig. it is a bunch of young agents and it is at a restaurant. it is going to be easy and we will make a lot of money.
i do not like you working with wendy. why are you working with wendy?
they requested her. it was her gig. max put me on as a favor.
some favor. i hope they know you are not like wendy.
oh, please.
if they asked for her, they are probably expecting blowjobs all around.
will you cut it out! get ready, we are already late.
who is watching the baby?
she is downstairs with ruth. get ready.
I am ready.
bullshit. these are classy customers. you can not show up all fucked up with a fila running suit on.
they are not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
you talk to max today?
I am not going to mention ricky to him.
do not expect you to mention it to him. I am just saying, if --
the only way he will go with ricky is if you are in too.
well, that is not going to happen.
fine. you want to help ricky, talk to maxie yourself.
i feel weird asking him.
you shouldn't. he likes you.
i just wish he never brought it up. ricky will not shut up about it.
forget ricky. you should be glad max got you driving for me.
no coke tonight.  right?
leave me alone. i have not touched anything in months.
martel's and coke. one ice cube. in a snifter this time.
snifter are for warm drinks --
yeah, snifters are for cognac --
when served warm --
what is the matter? you am not got no snifters in this motherfucker?
we have snifters
then put my martel's in a snifter.
it is already been a hell of a night. where you been?
i had a fight up at sportsman's.
well, you look it. you win?
draw.
what is your record at?
5-5-1.
yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
yeah, sure.
I am serious. humping sheetrock and driving on weekends got to get to you after a while. might be nice to buy your lady something. all it takes is one fight.
whu --
there is no touching.
but what about them?
i do not give a shit. i work for her. no touching.
i said no touching.
look, man, I am the bachelor, alright? i gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
get your hands off of her.
dude, listen, man. I am cool. how much for the treatment?
your dance is over.
come on, dude. the other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. i know the drill, I will wear a rubber --
what the fuck was that about?
you wanna get us busted? if max found out you were turning tricks --
i got news for you, bobby, he do not give a shit.
bullshit.
you think he do not know? i give him his cut of seventeen hundred, i think he knows i can not make that lap dancing.
no more.
nobody's fuckin talking to you.
and how could you fucking leave horrace hanging?
i got news for you, horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
bullshit.
what? you do not think horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang?
so I am like, 'maybe I am not on the list cause I am not a fuckin persian.'
i thought you hate that club.
i do. it is a fuckin persian palace.
then why do you try to get in?
fuck them.
shhh...
come on, man. not with the owners here.
hey, baby... nothing. what are you doing...? yeah, I will probably cut out early...
look, bobby, i do not know what happened, and i do not want to know what happened, but something is up.
what are you talking about?
maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. he wants you to come by the office today.
they were grabbing her fucking ass --
hey. i do not know, i do not want to know. far as I am concerned, you are a good kid. i got news, though, without you here i can not keep on your friend. i got enough people pretending to sweep.
do me a favor, arthur, keep him on til i see what is happening.
good luck.
hi, uh, excuse me. I am here to see mr. reuben.
you are bobby, right?
yeah.
good afternoon, bobby. I will let max know you are here.
he will be a minute, hon. you want some coffee?
no thank you.
you sure? i just made it.
no, thank you. I am good. thanks.
you like the ponies?
sure. yeah.
you bet the ponies?
me? no. not really.
smart. hard as hell to handicap. you know what i like? hai alai. fast game. you know why i like it?
why?
it is fixed. that is the only way to win. a sure thing. see that horse. the blaze.
this one?
yeah. the blaze. i bought her in '66. hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. that horse made me over a hundred grand. in 'sixties' dollars. you know what that is today?
pshhh...
a million. easy.
she was fast, huh?
never won a race. but it got me in with the trainer. we would have a thing, i do not remember, some fucking thing. the jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we would all go running. people get greedy. first they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. the odds would drop, i mean you could watch the goddamn board. it looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
that is why they call it the smart money.
i like you, kid. why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
mr. reuben, i swear to god, they were out of line.
last time, maybe, with the puerto ricans, but these were nice jewish boys.
they were out of line --
they are fucking yeshiva buchas. you did not have to tear up the goddamn place. you knocked out a guys teeth.
that prick tried to get jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
bobby, i love jessica like she is my own daughter. i would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in beverly hills and wants i should buy him an implant. your silverback horseshit's going to cost me eight grand.
I will work it off.
not driving jess, you won't.
what?
you are not driving jess no more. two strikes, bobby, and this last one was big. the bachelor's father goes to my schul.
so, that is it. I am out?
i did not say that.
then what are you saying?
bobby. you are a bull terrier and i got you herding sheep.
i do not understand.
it is my fault. i send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then i wonder why you seered. it is my fault. the tooth is on me. but no more. I am 'reassigning' you.
i do not want to drive another girl, max. the only reason I am --
who the fuck do you think you are talking to? this am not a fucking democracy. you want out?
no.
do not i put food on you are table? i sponsor your training, i take care of your girl and her little baby. i even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
i know.
now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what i got to say?
yeah. sorry.
i got a way we make everybody happy.
yeah.
we try something out. there is someone I am in business with named ruiz. i want you to accompany him on a drop.  just as scenery. ruiz has his boys. i just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. as a deterrent.
ruiz knows about this?
ruiz wants to go alone, but it is not up to ruiz. it is up to me, and i like a sure thing. just go and we are square on the tooth.
what about ricky? he would jump at the opportunity.
ricky? ricky 'i lost the truck' ricky?
you told him you liked him.
that was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
he will work it off.
i do not know the kid, and what little i do scares me.
he is good people, mr. reuben. i swear.
you vouch for him?
yeah. sure.
how 'bout this. if you are in, he is in.
i got to tell you, mr. reuben, I am not comfortable getting in any deeper. it is one thing to look after jess...
you are ready to move up. christ, the way you busted up the place, you are doing worse already. may as well get paid instead of punished.
it is not that i do not appreciate the offer...
do me a favor. think about it. is that too much too ask?
no. okay. I will think about it.
we need guns.
we do not need guns.
i think we might.
he did not say we need guns.
he implied it.
you do not imply about something like that. you lay it out on the table. besides, I am not taking the job.
this is the opportunity of a lifetime. what are you? nuts? you have been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
no. you have been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
damn right, i have. you think i like living on fucking yucca? we do a good job on this, we are in.
what happened to boxing? i thought we made a vow.
shit. who we kidding? i know i suck, and i held you up for ten rounds --
bullshit...
please. i got three inches on you. you would not have landed a punch if i did not let you.
you wanna go right now?
I will beat your ass --
sorry coach.
sorry coach.
we look good this year.
we will kill fairfax this year.
i still can not believe you missed the fucking team bus.
fuck him.
your first start at db, it is against fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
what are we delivering?
we are not delivering shit. ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
who is this fucking ruiz?
maxie says he runs a tight ship. i would not fuck with him.
some mexican? how much could he weigh? a buck fifty, tops? I would kick his fucking ass.
i gotta pick up the baby.
why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
i like it.
it is not even yours.
i like it.
nice work.
shhh...  yeah, yeah... no. no. I will be there.  you got to get me to the magic castle at four.
how did you unlock my phone?
i tried your atm pin. i got to kill an hour. let's grab a beer.
seat belt.
ricky's not wearing one.
ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
no, man. it wrinkles my shit. let's grab a fuckin beer --
c'mon, man, not in front of the baby. put on your seat belt before i get another ticket.
jesus christ, fine. alright?
see? now everyone's got one on.  what do you got there?
a elephant seal. where is mommy?
she's, uh, sleeping.
it is daytime.
mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. do not you like your pretty clothes?
no.
show uncle ricky what you made.
why can not we just grab a goddamn beer.
i promised chloe we would come here.
oh, give me a break. look at her. she do not even know where the hell she is. she would have more fun at bordner's.
I am not taking her to a bar.
why not? i grew up in bars. it is fun for a kid.
what is wrong, baby?
he is not doing it.
what? did she say something?
she wants you to paint the ashtray.
I am not painting the fu --, I am not painting the ashtray. and frogs are not purple.
it is a poison arrow tree frog.
will you paint the damn thing. why do you gotta be such a baby.
max will not let me drive jess to dance anymore.
who is driving her?
i do not know.
this paint sucks. the white shows through.
right here's fine.
is that the woman from..?
she really liked the kitchen.
go finish getting ready. I will take care of dinner.
yeah? you sure?
go.
you are not my daddy.
you gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
i want spaghettis.
what is up? jess ready?
you driving her?
yeah.
she will be out in a minute.
no way that cocksucker's driving you.
maybe if you did not go rambo every time i did a lapdance, you would still be doing it yourself. meantime, i got to feed my little girl.
maxie's fucking with me. he put you with the spook to get under my skin.
ho's a good guy --
ho's a fucking pimp! he encourages wendy to turn tricks. and she is his fucking wife!
shhh. he will hear you.
good! it will save me the trouble of repeating myself. he is not fucking driving you!
listen to me, bobby. this is my job. it puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
i want you to quit.
look at the bills. i can't. I am not going to put my daughter through what i went through.
I will support you.
with what?
max offered to stake me.
yeah, well max offers a lot of things. and i got news for you. he is not the sweet old man you think he is.
she needs a family. a dad. I will give her what you never had.
do not get my hopes up. if i quit, what then? i can not go through this again.
c'mon girl. eat up.
get away from her.
excuse --
can i borrow a piece of --
go ahead. open the fuckin things. you should each find fifteen hundred --
dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-a battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to jfk.
we are going to new york?
yes. you are going to new york.
and the money. where do we bring the money?
that money is your per diem.
and where do we bring it?
it is ours.
to keep?
yes, for expenses and such. now, you will be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. you each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. am i making myself abundantly clear?
yeah.
yeah.
you will not carry any other pagers with you. you will not carry anything, for that matter, that i have not just given you.
keys.
what?
what about my keys?
you can carry your keys. you will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. you will not speak to anyone while you are working. when you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. this means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. there is already a number in your pager's memory. it is a car service. when they ask you what account, you will respond: 'cardiff giant.' they will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. in other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. do you see a pattern forming?
yes.
yes.
what is it?
you want --
not you. i want ricky to answer.
i get it.
tell me.
do not worry. i get it.
so tell me how it is.
you want... why are you picking on me?
because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and i do not like you.
i already told you, i parked it for five minutes and i locked it with the club --
you want us to be wherever you want us to be, asap, no questions asked.
yes. goodbye.
so, wait, what are we dropping off?
goodbye.
holy shit. can you believe this?
pretty nice.
see, man. maxie fuckin takes care of you when you are in. beats cleaning carpets.
what is the movie?
I will get the girl.
nah, do not bother --
yes?
yeah, uh, what is the movie?
it is in your copy of hemispheres. i believe it is mickey blue eyes.
ugh...
I will get you the list of videos, if you do not mind, I will offer the other passengers a beverage.
yeah, sure. how much are they?
how much is what?
the videos.
you are up front. everything's free up here.
yes?
drinks are free, right?
yes.  would you care for another one?
yes.
you hear that? you can drink as much as you want up here.
we are not supposed to get drunk. we are on call.
unless we are supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, i do not think we are going to have to work in the next five hours.
i do not want to show up hammered. we are supposed to be representing max.
oh, I will represent alright.
yes.
where do you live?
excuse me.
where do you live?
i operate out of the chicago o'hare hub. can i help you with anything else?
yeah. me and my boy here are going to be in new york overnight. i want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. I am talkin' a california style, tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. and make that drink a double.
shit. no new pages. i do not even know where the fuck we are supposed to go.
maybe we should call for a cab.
no. look. there.
'cardiff giant.' that is us.
you sure?
yeah. he said that is our account with the car service.
hi. i, uh, think that is us.
hi. I am jimmy.
bobby.
ricky.
soho grand, right?
what is that?
you are going to the soho grand hotel, right?
I am not sure. all i know is the account is cardiff giant.
yeah. you are staying at the soho grand. you got anything checked?
nah.
traveling light. i like that.
is it nice?
the soho grand?
yeah.
you are from la, right?
yeah.
you will love it.
so whenever we want...
yeah. grab one of the cards behind you. call that number. it is my cell.
so you are our own private guy?
i handle most of cardiff giant's stuff.
you know my pager number?
no. what is it?
i do not know. i thought you might. any idea what the job is?
the 'job?' alls i know is I am taking you to the soho grand.
where is the soho grand?
soho.
...and here is the key to the mini- bar. room and tax has been picked up by cardiff giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
what is 'incidentals?'
phone, room service, mini-bar. any additional expense. if you need anything you can push the button marked 'concierge', and they will be able to help you.
now, mr. slade, you are in room 315.
just give me the key. I am going to stay here.
yes, sir.
is it a good room?
i can take you down there.
just tell me. wait, here... do you have change of a hundred?
not on me, sir.
here. take it. bring me back eighty.
are you sure?
yeah. take it.
thank you very much, sir.
so?
what, sir?
is it the good room?
all the suites are about the same.
come on. just tell me. it will save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
honestly, the suites are all about the same.
what if i gave you forty?
it is as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
no. that is cool. bring me back eighty.
thank you, sir.
where is the place to go tonight?
as far as...?
nightlife. where is the hot ass?
women?
yeah 'women.' if i was a fag i could get laid in a subway.
i do not know, forum's pretty hot tonight. it might be hard to get in, though.
do not worry about me getting in. just tell me where it is.
it is on west broadway.
see you later.
who you calling?
shhh... hello, room service?
c'mon, man...
yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of heinekens. I am in room... how did you know? oh. yeah. how long? cool.
how much is it?
how much? okay. make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. bye.
how much was it?
forty-six.
jesus, man. plus ten?
yeah, i guess.
great. on my fucking room.
relax. you got one-fifty. you heard the guy.
ricky, who knows how long we are going to have to be here. we got to make it last.
fine. I will put it on my room. okay?
do not worry about it. just be smart.
but let me tell you, man, i do not like your attitude already.
oh really. why is that?
we just got moved up in the world. you got to let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. you got to start owning it man, or they will smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
who is going to smell me a mile away?
do not play dumb. you know what I am talking about.
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
i know you are not calling jimmy.
as a matter of fact i was. you got a problem with that?
we are here representing max. you are acting like a puerto rican on the fifteenth of the month.
you think maxie does not want us to roll hard? why do you think he gave us all this bread? or the number on the pager? we got to represent him by showing some class. the man's got an operation. how does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
it is on west broadway. we can walk.
well, i do not want to walk.
yeah... mmmm, that sounds good... uhu...
excuse me, we need to make a call.
I am on the phone.
it is important.
so's this.  hey baby... oh, nothing. what were you saying?
listen, man, we really gotta...
i be off in a minute.  say again...?
shit. it is thirty-five cents. you got a dime?
fuck...
so, jimmy, you know where this address is?
yeah. I will find it. it is in harlem.
harlem? what is it, a restaurant?
you do not know where you are going?
no. just the cross streets.
well, this is the corner.
i can wait around if you want.
no. that is cool, man.
what exactly did they say?
they said a hundred thirty-fifth and twelfth.
they did not say an address?
i told you what they said.
nothing else.
nothing.
how did they know who you were?
they asked who it was.
so they said more than the address.
no. they asked who i was, then told me what corner.
this is bullshit, man.
what the fuck do you...
what the fuck do you have to complain about?
do not even start.
no. tell me. what is so fucking horrible about this gig? you have been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on maxie's list, and here we are.
look, man, i never met ruiz, okay? i do not know what the fuck I am picking up, what the fuck I am dropping off, who the fuck I am meeting. all i know is maxie's still pissed at me cause i sold his fucking van.
you sold it? i thought they stole it.
sold it, stole it, whatever...
motherfucker...
oh, give me a break. do not tell me you feel bad for the guy.
you gotta be kidding me. i vouched for you.
relax. I will do right by him. you know that.
you just do not fucking get it, do you?
you know he fucks all his girls, do not you?
what the fuck is that supposed --
i mean, that is what i heard --

where is spa.
jimmy knows. 13th street. we will meet you there.
this shit's sketchy. why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we are supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
i do not know.
well, i thought you understood and i was just missing it.
missing what? he did not say shit.
yeah, but you know horrace. what did you get off him?
what did i 'get?'
yeah. what vibe?
i detected no vibe other than that ruiz thinks you are a fucking idiot.
yo, fuck him, man. calling us guineas...

so, when is the drop.
to be honest, man, i do not know shit either. all i know is it am not drugs and it am not now.
how do you know it is not drugs?
maxie knows i do not go near drugs. i did a minute in quentin for possession with intent. and it am not now cause he woulda told me.

'strapped?'
it means you got a gun?
i know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. what the fuck you think this shit is? '21 jump street?'  cool out, they are coming back. just throw up your screw face and do not speak unless spoken to.

'dis?' 'dis?' you are not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your real world sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. you are nothing. you are wallpaper. you are not here to make fucking friends. asking a motherfucker where he lives. and who the fuck told you 'red dragon'?.
we get it. we are sorry.
now that limey motherfucker's jumpy and wants to change shit around on me. maxie's going to shit a nokia when he hears about... aw, shit, i better call him before he hears.
I am not saying shit to neither of you.
why? what i say bad?
what the fuck, 'red dragon?'
what? why am i bad?
how bad is it?
it is bad. before you even showed up, he said you were maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. he wanted to tcb alone. i was going to ride shotgun to keep the english dude above board. now he is spooked. this shit's snowballing.
when is it going down?
was gonna be tomorrow morning. now, who knows?
shit.
see you later.
you really in trouble?
stop.
I will tell him someone else told me.
just do not ask me no more shit.
you happy?
about what?
why you gotta make everything difficult?
you too?
yeah, me too. you are a fucking bull in a china shop.
fuck this.
where do you think you are going?
back in.
you fucking nuts?
work's over. I am going to party.
you can not go in there. they know you are with ruiz.
you got that right.
fuck you. go then. I am taking the car.
fine.
look who is back? want some champagne?
do not put this on ruiz's tab. start a new one.
damn right. bring us two bottles of dom champs and here, take fifty in case i call you bitch later when I am drunk.  siddown, motherfucker.  'sex and paychecks.'
so, wait, you are from where?
manhattan.
you girls are not from brooklyn or anything?
no.
i do not get it. what do you do?
we are in fashion.
so you are models?
we rep lines? you know? fashion?
and you grew up in manhattan?
kinda. yeah.
what do you mean 'kinda?'
i do not know about you guys, but I am starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
what happened? i thought we were playing truth or dare.
look at, ladies. i could sit here and take turns throwing skittles at your ass all night. but i feel what you guys are putting out there. I am only a mirror reflecting what I am getting from you. and I am saying yes to it. I am shaking hands with it. i see the road that you are pointing down and I am saying I will ride shotgun. and when your foot slams on the accelerator, i will not get scared. I will stand up and let the wind blow through my long blonde hair. with my summer dress clinging to my bosom yelling 'faster, billy! faster! drive faster! faster yet -- !'
will you leave me alone, already...? no, sean, it is over... i do not care... as a matter of fact, i am... yeah. in his hotel room...
holy shit.
I am having fun, sean. can you handle that...? yeah. he does not judge me.
i do not wear a white wig, i do not carry a gavel.
that is a good idea, maybe i will!
is he cute?
he is okay.
should i fuck him?
i do not know. do whatever you want.
he is great, right. is he great?
he is alright.
i know.
but maybe that is okay. maybe that is just what you need.
what the fuck's going on?
dude, get back out there. you got to help me get them in the hot tub.  hang on girls! just get out there. I will be right out. you know how i do.
yeah, i know how you do. i know how you do. I have heard your kibbles and bits all fucking night. you have been shaking your ass like an unemployed clown. how the room's a boiling pot of sugar water. how you are going to dip a string into it and make rockcandy. who wants to play 'just the tip?' dancing around like a smacked ass. oh, and that coat check girl you have been dragging around as 'insurance' does not even speak english.
okay. we got a lot happening here. here comes the good part... okay...
somebody is getting comfortable.
where is the surprise?
you want your surprise?
yeah. i want it.
well, come on then. it is back here.
you want to come splash around.
I am just warning you, i can not swim.
i want to leave right now.
i did not do anything --
what the hell did you do?
i swear to god, i did not do anything.
oh no. what is it this time.
we used to take baths together.
come on. let's go.
what the fuck was that about?
she was jonesing for me.
hi.  it is ruiz.  yeah. so the driver knows where to go? when? we will be down in five. no, I will tell him. he is right there. bye.
what is up?
he wants to see us now.
where?
he said it is being arranged. he said jimmy will know.
we are getting whacked.
we are not getting whacked.
why else you think he will not tell us where the sit down is?
it is not a 'sit down.' he said he is telling us the plan.
what are you doing.
i got a bad feeling, man. i do not want to go in naked.
you gonna shank him in the shower?
is it so unrealistic to think ruiz, who does not even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? as an apology? and i do not even know what we are dropping off or picking up --
we are getting ahead of ourselves. we have not gotten any sleep. let's just keep our mouthes shut and not make any mistakes. now hurry up and get your shit on so we are not late and make things worse.
put that shit out...
c'mon, man...
i swear to god, I will fucking puke.
hey, jimmy, where they taking us?
yeah. where they gonna whack us?
jesus christ, where the fuck you been all night? you look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
good morning.
good morning.
you think this shit's funny, ho?
nah, man...
you think it is funny, motherfucker?
do not 'easy ruiz' me. you all turned a easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon.  bring me four eggs benedict and a mimosa. you all want mimosas?
nah, man...
no...
four mimosas.  you will love them. so here's the plan. i did not say shit to maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and i do not want to get him all worked up.
he has a cute what...?
a bad heart.
i did not tell him shit. he worries too much. i love that old jew, but he is going to kill himself worrying. we started this shit, and we are going to finish it.
who is going to outfit us?
outfit? what is he talking about?
nothing, man.
you want us strapped, do not you?
last thing i want is you with a gun.
word.
what is the plan?
tom, the welsh dude --
the red dragon.
shut it, man. shut it. tom is a square. he do not but dabble in shit. maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an austrian passbook account.
so, we are talking money laundering...
will you tell peter jennings to shut up and fucking listen. the shit's as routine as you get. i coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but maxie likes to do it all his way. safe. i coulda dropped the bag alone. it is only two hundred g's. but he sent you all. so i can either send you home and tell maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
let's do it.
I am your soldier.
now listen. the gig could not be simpler. you carry the money to the welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you are done. the washed money goes directly to maxie. long as you hand off the bag, you are tight.
where is the drop?
you three are gonna meet him for dinner. find out if and where. now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?
yeah.
what?
when all this is over and we are not working for maxie, I would love to run into you on the street.  why are not you coming?
that is none of your fucking business.
why is not ruiz coming?
this welsh dude is tripping on ruiz cause he is a shot caller.
what is that?
a shot caller. a boss, a capo. he is running shit.
yeah.
the welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. but you motherfuckers, he just laughs. all beat up in your babaloo suit like fruitpie the magician.
so we just go eat with him and that is going to solve everything?
dude, you just got to settle your shit down. you got to go and say all that 'red dragon' shit. make him think he is on barretta.
like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the quick and split.
so what do we do?
we go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. we make the drop, go home to california.
where is this happening?
we meet at the globe on park avenue at six forty-five. I will see you then.
let's check out the penguins.
the what?
the penguin house.
wait a minute. you want to look at fucking penguins now?
yeah. let's look at the penguins.
did you hear what he just said?
whatever. we are here. we may as well go to the penguin house.
I am tired and I am scared, and I am not looking at fucking penguins.
we need guns.
we do not need guns.
I am pretty sure we do.
i listened extremely carefully. nothing was even vaguely implied. he even laughed in your face when you asked him
all the more reason.
you would not even know where to get one.
wanna bet?
you could not even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you going to get a gun?
that is cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
it was six in the fucking morning.
float me a hundred bucks.
why?
you wanna see how fast i get a gun?
you are out of money?
no.
what do you have left?
eighty.
eighty bucks?!?
eighty five.
what happened to the fifteen hundred?
you coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
i did! i paid for half the fuckin drinks!
you did?
yes i did. you asshole! what about the room?
what about it?
they only cover one fifty in incidentals. you have been ordering fucking... motherfucker...
calm down.
i fucking vouched for you. i vouched for you and you fucked me.
this shit's peanuts compared to what we are going to make with maxie.
ricky. I am trying to save this money. understand? I am trying to make it so my girlfriend does not have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
I am sorry...
this is horseshit. it coulda been so easy.
it is going to be fine.
no more, man.
let's get some sleep. that is what we need, man. sleep.
how we gonna sleep? we only got a few hours til dinner.
so what do we do?
let's just go now and wait.
three and a half hours?
i do not want to take any more chances.
let's just go get guns, I would feel better.
do not fuck around. you are going to get us all killed.
think about it: you knocked out that jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. maybe lost his whole line of clientele? he knows you are fucking up jess' dancing, and i got a feeling he knows i stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. he can not kill us in la cause that leads to too many questions. so he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that is turned into whatever? he can make us disappear out here real nice...
where do you get this shit?
scenario b. i think I am getting under ruiz's skin. I am no dummy. he does not like how it went down with the red drag -- welshman, whatever. now i got fruitpie the magician telling me i can not call my man max? and that welshman's sketchy.  whatever, i do not know where it is coming, which way it is coming from, I am telling you one thing right now, I am not going to be late for the dance.
you are not getting a gun.
look. they are together. you telling me this am not a set-up?
easy...
hey, boys.
tom. how is it going?
fine, fine. and you were...?
bobby and ricky.
right, right. the 'thugs.'
and where is...?
ruiz? oh, he am not here.
no?
nah, see, maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. he, you know, he tied in with the club. set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
well, i did not care for the club much. and, i must say, i did not care for him either.
well, he am not going to be around no more.
pity. what is say we have a drink?
dip?
yeah. this shit's fucking brilliant. i just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. i got to bring a case of it home to my mates. it is illegal back home, you know.
no shit?
does anyone want another?
you want another drink?
I will get it.
who is up for a night on the town.
sure. anyplace in particular?
i hear the china club is a laugh.
what do you want?
a little charlie, perhaps.
coke?
I have heard you have got the best coke in the states. the shit back home is pants.
that should not be a problem.
sorry, mates. now there is not even enough to go around...
do not worry, man. it is all for you.
no, really, mate?
here...
ow, shit...
watch it...
c'mon...
fuck...
now, here's what worries me. he said he wants to meet up at a bar in red hook. you know where that is?
no.
brooklyn.
yeah?
he must have that shit troughed.
what do you mean 'troughed?'
troughed off. protected. like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
ruiz tied in out there?
nah, man. no one is. they got some puerto ricans and a new crop of fuckin irish immigrants.
I am half irish.
i do not fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin irish. you heard of the westies?.
heard of them.
they ran shit back in the eighties. used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. that is back when the irish was making a play against the italians. i do not know if they still around, but i do not fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
it sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. and since all it is is a drop, the welshman's got nothing at stake. i say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. it will calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
and not a word to maxie. he will shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
hello.
chloe?
uncle bobby?
hi, baby. what are you doing awake? where is mommy?
i do not know.
mommy's not home?
no.
what time is it there?
can you take me to color me mine?
yeah. are you sure mommy's not home? it is very late.
i got to go, baby. i love you. tell mommy i called. you be a big girl and be careful when you are alone.
i love you. come home.
are not we waiting for ricky?
ricky's taken care of.
taken care of?
yeah, he is getting there on his own.
where we going?
quick drop. in and out.
where is ricky?
ricky's taken care of.
how so?
he was uptown when i paged him. i gave him the address. he is meeting us there.
that it?
that is it.
this is it.
where is ricky.
i guess inside. or he never made it. either way, i do not give a shit. let's get this over with.
here they are, then.
how is it going?
brilliantly. care for a pint?
no, thanks, man. we got to head out.
come, now. you just got here.
that is alright, man. it is a little early for me to drink.
sorry about that. where is your mate?
could not make it. here's the money.
i can not yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
no, man, that is fine. just put that you took delivery.
i... i just hired these guys to watch my back...
motherfucker, we are handing you money. what the hell we going to pull?
holy shit. get me back to manhattan.
take us right to kennedy. now.
i never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. i should have been informed there was a flag on the play, but I will take that up with ruiz. i made a few calls back east. those punks were not tied in with anyone. as for the welshman, he was not in on it. he was just plain dumb. as for you, ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
but, max --
we are square.
yes, sir.
and, as for you, bobby, you just moved up a notch. your days of fighting for crumbs is through. take a week off, come back, and we will talk about the next thing.
there will not be a next thing.
take a few days --
i do not need a few days. I am going to settle down with jess. she is through dancing. we are opening a restaurant.
i hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I have been paying jess' rent for six months. she is got to keep dancing --
dude, we were practically made...
I will drop you off in a minute. i want to see if the baby's up. you wanna come in?
no. I will wait here.
I will be a minute.
i -- i -- i... don't...
i do not get it.
i never promised you anything.
how could you let her see this?
goodbye, bobby.
just so you know, i bought you out with maxie. i suggest you leave while you can.
do not you get it? i do not want to leave. this is who i am.
tell you the truth, i do not give a shit for me. but that little girl is so special, and you are going to fuck her up.
take her.
what did you say?
i want you to take her with you.
