did max mention anything about any jobs?
what about boxing?
what about it?
what are you saying?
you said if you didn't have a winning record after eleven fights, you'd talk to max.
so?
so, it was a draw.
yeah, i'm 5-5 and 1.
so, it's not a winning record.
it's not losing record.
that's not what you said. you said if you didn't have a winning record --
don't be shitty.
how am i being shitty?
don't be shitty.
i wouldn't keep bugging you, but you said he said he would have a job for us.
i'm not gonna bring it up to him.
of course i don't want you to bring it up to him... but if it comes up...
i'll page you.
yeah. page me. you know the number?
yeah. i know the number.
cause if you don't know the number, i can page you with the number so you'll have the number.
i know the number.
i'll page you with the number. i'll see you later. what time you done?
i got no idea.
ask if he said anything to her.
i will.
i'll page you with the number.
bye.
honey?
where were you?
so, what kind of gig is this?
easy night. bachelor party. can we give wendy a ride?
no. what kind of bachelor party?
the easy kind. they're young and rich and well mannered.
oh my god. what happened?
a draw. what makes you think they're well mannered?
bobby, this is a plumb gig. it's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. it's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
i don't like you working with wendy. why are you working with wendy?
they requested her. it was her gig. max put me on as a favor.
some favor. i hope they know you're not like wendy.
oh, please.
if they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
will you cut it out! get ready, we're already late.
who's watching the baby?
she's downstairs with ruth. get ready.
i'm ready.
bullshit. these are classy customers. you can't show up all fucked up with a fila running suit on.
they're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
you talk to max today?
i'm not gonna mention ricky to him.
don't expect you to mention it to him. i'm just saying, if --
the only way he'll go with ricky is if you're in too.
well, that's not gonna happen.
fine. you want to help ricky, talk to maxie yourself.
i feel weird asking him.
you shouldn't. he likes you.
i just wish he never brought it up. ricky won't shut up about it.
forget ricky. you should be glad max got you driving for me.
no coke tonight.  right?
leave me alone. i haven't touched anything in months.
martel's and coke. one ice cube. in a snifter this time.
snifter are for warm drinks --
yeah, snifters are for cognac --
when served warm --
what's the matter? you ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
we have snifters
then put my martel's in a snifter.
it's already been a hell of a night. where you been?
i had a fight up at sportsman's.
well, you look it. you win?
draw.
what's your record at?
5-5-1.
yeah, well you let me know when you wanna start makin the real money.
yeah, sure.
i'm serious. humping sheetrock and driving on weekends got to get to you after a while. might be nice to buy your lady something. all it takes is one fight.
whu --
there's no touching.
but what about them?
i don't give a shit. i work for her. no touching.
i said no touching.
look, man, i'm the bachelor, alright? i gave her a hundred bucks in tips alone --
get your hands off of her.
dude, listen, man. i'm cool. how much for the treatment?
your dance is over.
come on, dude. the other chick's giving my best man a blow job in the toilet. i know the drill, i'll wear a rubber --
what the fuck was that about?
you wanna get us busted? if max found out you were turning tricks --
i got news for you, bobby, he don't give a shit.
bullshit.
you think he don't know? i give him his cut of seventeen hundred, i think he knows i can't make that lap dancing.
no more.
nobody's fuckin talking to you.
and how could you fucking leave horrace hanging?
i got news for you, horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
bullshit.
what? you don't think horrace would leave your white ass in there to hang?
so i'm like, 'maybe i'm not on the list cause i'm not a fuckin persian.'
i thought you hate that club.
i do. it's a fuckin persian palace.
then why do you try to get in?
fuck them.
shhh...
come on, man. not with the owners here.
hey, baby... nothing. what are you doing...? yeah, i'll probably cut out early...
look, bobby, i don't know what happened, and i don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
what are you talking about?
maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. he wants you to come by the office today.
they were grabbing her fucking ass --
hey. i don't know, i don't want to know. far as i'm concerned, you're a good kid. i got news, though, without you here i can't keep on your friend. i got enough people pretending to sweep.
do me a favor, arthur, keep him on til i see what's happening.
good luck.
hi, uh, excuse me. i'm here to see mr. reuben.
you're bobby, right?
yeah.
good afternoon, bobby. i'll let max know you're here.
he'll be a minute, hon. you want some coffee?
no thank you.
you sure? i just made it.
no, thank you. i'm good. thanks.
you like the ponies?
sure. yeah.
you bet the ponies?
me? no. not really.
smart. hard as hell to handicap. you know what i like? hai alai. fast game. you know why i like it?
why?
it's fixed. that's the only way to win. a sure thing. see that horse. the blaze.
this one?
yeah. the blaze. i bought her in '66. hired a trainer, stall, whatever it was. that horse made me over a hundred grand. in 'sixties' dollars. you know what that is today?
pshhh...
a million. easy.
she was fast, huh?
never won a race. but it got me in with the trainer. we'd have a thing, i don't remember, some fucking thing. the jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. people get greedy. first they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. the odds would drop, i mean you could watch the goddamn board. it looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
that's why they call it the smart money.
i like you, kid. why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
mr. reuben, i swear to god, they were out of line.
last time, maybe, with the puerto ricans, but these were nice jewish boys.
they were out of line --
they're fucking yeshiva buchas. you didn't have to tear up the goddamn place. you knocked out a guys teeth.
that prick tried to get jessica to blow him in the bathroom --
bobby, i love jessica like she's my own daughter. i would kill anyone so much as lays a finger on her or her beautiful daughter, but that fucking pisher you socked in the mouth has the most expensive dentist in beverly hills and wants i should buy him an implant. your silverback horseshit's gonna cost me eight grand.
i'll work it off.
not driving jess, you won't.
what?
you're not driving jess no more. two strikes, bobby, and this last one was big. the bachelor's father goes to my schul.
so, that's it. i'm out?
i didn't say that.
then what are you saying?
bobby. you're a bull terrier and i got you herding sheep.
i don't understand.
it's my fault. i send you out to watch scum drool all over the love of your life, then i wonder why you seered. it's my fault. the tooth is on me. but no more. i'm 'reassigning' you.
i don't want to drive another girl, max. the only reason i'm --
who the fuck do you think you're talking to? this ain't a fucking democracy. you want out?
no.
don't i put food on you're table? i sponsor your training, i take care of your girl and her little baby. i even pay that deadbeat friend of yours to push a goddamn broom.
i know.
now you wanna shut up and listen and hear what i got to say?
yeah. sorry.
i got a way we make everybody happy.
yeah.
we try something out. there's someone i'm in business with named ruiz. i want you to accompany him on a drop.  just as scenery. ruiz has his boys. i just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. as a deterrent.
ruiz knows about this?
ruiz wants to go alone, but it's not up to ruiz. it's up to me, and i like a sure thing. just go and we're square on the tooth.
what about ricky? he'd jump at the opportunity.
ricky? ricky 'i lost the truck' ricky?
you told him you liked him.
that was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
he'll work it off.
i don't know the kid, and what little i do scares me.
he's good people, mr. reuben. i swear.
you vouch for him?
yeah. sure.
how 'bout this. if you're in, he's in.
i gotta tell you, mr. reuben, i'm not comfortable getting in any deeper. it's one thing to look after jess...
you're ready to move up. christ, the way you busted up the place, you're doing worse already. may as well get paid instead of punished.
it's not that i don't appreciate the offer...
do me a favor. think about it. is that too much too ask?
no. okay. i'll think about it.
we need guns.
we don't need guns.
i think we might.
he didn't say we need guns.
he implied it.
you don't imply about something like that. you lay it out on the table. besides, i'm not taking the job.
this is the opportunity of a lifetime. what are you? nuts? you've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
no. you've been waiting for this kind of opportunity.
damn right, i have. you think i like living on fucking yucca? we do a good job on this, we're in.
what happened to boxing? i thought we made a vow.
shit. who we kidding? i know i suck, and i held you up for ten rounds --
bullshit...
please. i got three inches on you. you wouldn't have landed a punch if i didn't let you.
you wanna go right now?
i'll beat your ass --
sorry coach.
sorry coach.
we look good this year.
we'll kill fairfax this year.
i still can't believe you missed the fucking team bus.
fuck him.
your first start at db, it's against fairfax, and you miss the fucking bus.
what are we delivering?
we're not delivering shit. ruiz is delivering something, and whatever it is is his business.
who is this fucking ruiz?
maxie says he runs a tight ship. i wouldn't fuck with him.
some mexican? how much could he weigh? a buck fifty, tops? i'd kick his fucking ass.
i gotta pick up the baby.
why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
i like it.
it's not even yours.
i like it.
nice work.
shhh...  yeah, yeah... no. no. i'll be there.  you gotta get me to the magic castle at four.
how'd you unlock my phone?
i tried your atm pin. i gotta kill an hour. let's grab a beer.
seat belt.
ricky's not wearing one.
ricky, can you put on a seat belt?
no, man. it wrinkles my shit. let's grab a fuckin beer --
c'mon, man, not in front of the baby. put on your seat belt before i get another ticket.
jesus christ, fine. alright?
see? now everyone's got one on.  what do you got there?
a elephant seal. where's mommy?
she's, uh, sleeping.
it's daytime.
mommy works hard so you can have all your pretty clothes. don't you like your pretty clothes?
no.
show uncle ricky what you made.
why can't we just grab a goddamn beer.
i promised chloe we'd come here.
oh, give me a break. look at her. she don't even know where the hell she is. she'd have more fun at bordner's.
i'm not taking her to a bar.
why not? i grew up in bars. it's fun for a kid.
what's wrong, baby?
he's not doing it.
what? did she say something?
she wants you to paint the ashtray.
i'm not painting the fu --, i'm not painting the ashtray. and frogs aren't purple.
it's a poison arrow tree frog.
will you paint the damn thing. why do you gotta be such a baby.
max won't let me drive jess to dance anymore.
who's driving her?
i don't know.
this paint sucks. the white shows through.
right here's fine.
is that the woman from..?
she really liked the kitchen.
go finish getting ready. i'll take care of dinner.
yeah? you sure?
go.
you're not my daddy.
you gonna bust my horns, or you want spaghetti
i want spaghettis.
what's up? jess ready?
you driving her?
yeah.
she'll be out in a minute.
no way that cocksucker's driving you.
maybe if you didn't go rambo every time i did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. meantime, i gotta feed my little girl.
maxie's fucking with me. he put you with the spook to get under my skin.
ho's a good guy --
ho's a fucking pimp! he encourages wendy to turn tricks. and she's his fucking wife!
shhh. he'll hear you.
good! it'll save me the trouble of repeating myself. he's not fucking driving you!
listen to me, bobby. this is my job. it puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
i want you to quit.
look at the bills. i can't. i'm not gonna put my daughter through what i went through.
i'll support you.
with what?
max offered to stake me.
yeah, well max offers a lot of things. and i got news for you. he's not the sweet old man you think he is.
she needs a family. a dad. i'll give her what you never had.
don't get my hopes up. if i quit, what then? i can't go through this again.
c'mon girl. eat up.
get away from her.
excuse --
can i borrow a piece of --
go ahead. open the fuckin things. you should each find fifteen hundred --
dollars in c-notes, a numeric pager, a double-a battery, and a first class round-trip ticket to jfk.
we're going to new york?
yes. you're going to new york.
and the money. where do we bring the money?
that money is your per diem.
and where do we bring it?
it's ours.
to keep?
yes, for expenses and such. now, you'll be contacted on your pager as to where you should go. you each have been given an extra battery, so there is absolutely no excuse as to why a page would not be immediately returned. am i making myself abundantly clear?
yeah.
yeah.
you will not carry any other pagers with you. you will not carry anything, for that matter, that i have not just given you.
keys.
what?
what about my keys?
you can carry your keys. you will not mention my name or imply that you are in my employ. you will not speak to anyone while you are working. when you are not working, you are considered to be 'on call' and available twenty-four hours a day. this means you will not get drunk or do anything that will prevent you from operating in a professional manner. there is already a number in your pager's memory. it is a car service. when they ask you what account, you will respond: 'cardiff giant.' they will pick you up and take you anywhere you need to go. in other words, there is no reason why you should not reach any destination that you will be called upon to reach within fifteen minutes. do you see a pattern forming?
yes.
yes.
what is it?
you want --
not you. i want ricky to answer.
i get it.
tell me.
don't worry. i get it.
so tell me how it is.
you want... why are you picking on me?
because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and i don't like you.
i already told you, i parked it for five minutes and i locked it with the club --
you want us to be wherever you want us to be, asap, no questions asked.
yes. goodbye.
so, wait, what are we dropping off?
goodbye.
holy shit. can you believe this?
pretty nice.
see, man. maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. beats cleaning carpets.
what's the movie?
i'll get the girl.
nah, don't bother --
yes?
yeah, uh, what's the movie?
it's in your copy of hemispheres. i believe it's mickey blue eyes.
ugh...
i'll get you the list of videos, if you don't mind, i'll offer the other passengers a beverage.
yeah, sure. how much are they?
how much is what?
the videos.
you're up front. everything's free up here.
yes?
drinks are free, right?
yes.  would you care for another one?
yes.
you hear that? you can drink as much as you want up here.
we're not supposed to get drunk. we're on call.
unless we're supposed to whack out the fuckin' pilot, i don't think we're gonna have to work in the next five hours.
i don't want to show up hammered. we're supposed to be representing max.
oh, i'll represent alright.
yes.
where do you live?
excuse me.
where do you live?
i operate out of the chicago o'hare hub. can i help you with anything else?
yeah. me and my boy here are gonna be in new york overnight. i want you to pass the word around to the honeys back in business class that you all got plans for tonight. i'm talkin' a california style, tupac, gangster pool party back at the hotel. and make that drink a double.
shit. no new pages. i don't even know where the fuck we're supposed to go.
maybe we should call for a cab.
no. look. there.
'cardiff giant.' that's us.
you sure?
yeah. he said that's our account with the car service.
hi. i, uh, think that's us.
hi. i'm jimmy.
bobby.
ricky.
soho grand, right?
what's that?
you're going to the soho grand hotel, right?
i'm not sure. all i know is the account is cardiff giant.
yeah. you're staying at the soho grand. you got anything checked?
nah.
traveling light. i like that.
is it nice?
the soho grand?
yeah.
you're from la, right?
yeah.
you'll love it.
so whenever we want...
yeah. grab one of the cards behind you. call that number. it's my cell.
so you're our own private guy?
i handle most of cardiff giant's stuff.
you know my pager number?
no. what is it?
i don't know. i thought you might. any idea what the job is?
the 'job?' alls i know is i'm taking you to the soho grand.
where is the soho grand?
soho.
...and here is the key to the mini- bar. room and tax has been picked up by cardiff giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
what's 'incidentals?'
phone, room service, mini-bar. any additional expense. if you need anything you can push the button marked 'concierge', and they'll be able to help you.
now, mr. slade, you're in room 315.
just give me the key. i'm gonna stay here.
yes, sir.
is it a good room?
i can take you down there.
just tell me. wait, here... do you have change of a hundred?
not on me, sir.
here. take it. bring me back eighty.
are you sure?
yeah. take it.
thank you very much, sir.
so?
what, sir?
is it the good room?
all the suites are about the same.
come on. just tell me. it'll save all the trouble of you showing me all the rooms.
honestly, the suites are all about the same.
what if i gave you forty?
it's as good a suite as we have, unless you want two bedrooms.
no. that's cool. bring me back eighty.
thank you, sir.
where's the place to go tonight?
as far as...?
nightlife. where's the hot ass?
women?
yeah 'women.' if i was a fag i could get laid in a subway.
i don't know, forum's pretty hot tonight. it might be hard to get in, though.
don't worry about me getting in. just tell me where it is.
it's on west broadway.
see you later.
who you calling?
shhh... hello, room service?
c'mon, man...
yeah, bring up two burgers and a couple of heinekens. i'm in room... how'd you know? oh. yeah. how long? cool.
how much is it?
how much? okay. make it fifteen minutes and you can add on a ten dollar tip. bye.
how much was it?
forty-six.
jesus, man. plus ten?
yeah, i guess.
great. on my fucking room.
relax. you got one-fifty. you heard the guy.
ricky, who knows how long we're gonna have to be here. we gotta make it last.
fine. i'll put it on my room. okay?
don't worry about it. just be smart.
but let me tell you, man, i don't like your attitude already.
oh really. why's that?
we just got moved up in the world. you gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. you gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
who's gonna smell me a mile away?
don't play dumb. you know what i'm talking about.
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
i know you're not calling jimmy.
as a matter of fact i was. you got a problem with that?
we're here representing max. you're acting like a puerto rican on the fifteenth of the month.
you think maxie doesn't want us to roll hard? why do you think he gave us all this bread? or the number on the pager? we gotta represent him by showing some class. the man's got an operation. how does it reflect on him if we nickel and dime it?
it's on west broadway. we can walk.
well, i don't want to walk.
yeah... mmmm, that sounds good... uhu...
excuse me, we need to make a call.
i'm on the phone.
it's important.
so's this.  hey baby... oh, nothing. what were you saying?
listen, man, we really gotta...
i be off in a minute.  say again...?
shit. it's thirty-five cents. you got a dime?
fuck...
so, jimmy, you know where this address is?
yeah. i'll find it. it's in harlem.
harlem? what is it, a restaurant?
you don't know where you're going?
no. just the cross streets.
well, this is the corner.
i can wait around if you want.
no. that's cool, man.
what exactly did they say?
they said a hundred thirty-fifth and twelfth.
they didn't say an address?
i told you what they said.
nothing else.
nothing.
how'd they know who you were?
they asked who it was.
so they said more than the address.
no. they asked who i was, then told me what corner.
this is bullshit, man.
what the fuck do you...
what the fuck do you have to complain about?
don't even start.
no. tell me. what's so fucking horrible about this gig? you've been crawling up my ass for six months to get your name on maxie's list, and here we are.
look, man, i never met ruiz, okay? i don't know what the fuck i'm picking up, what the fuck i'm dropping off, who the fuck i'm meeting. all i know is maxie's still pissed at me cause i sold his fucking van.
you sold it? i thought they stole it.
sold it, stole it, whatever...
motherfucker...
oh, give me a break. don't tell me you feel bad for the guy.
you gotta be kidding me. i vouched for you.
relax. i'll do right by him. you know that.
you just don't fucking get it, do you?
you know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
what the fuck is that supposed --
i mean, that's what i heard --
you got something to say --

yeah, bring us four fernet.
four fernet.

yeah. that fernet tastes like tar. my grandfather tried to give me that.

it's a digestif.
nigger, please. don't even order that artichoke shit. west side guineas. forget the drinks, leo. we gotta roll. what do i owe you?
we're square.
thanks, man. you need anything, you call.

where's spa.
jimmy knows. 13th street. we'll meet you there.
this shit's sketchy. why do they drop us in the middle of nowhere to have the guy we're supposed to meet come meet us just to tell us we have to meet the same guy somewhere else?
i don't know.
well, i thought you understood and i was just missing it.
missing what? he didn't say shit.
yeah, but you know horrace. what did you get off him?
what did i 'get?'
yeah. what vibe?
i detected no vibe other than that ruiz thinks you're a fucking idiot.
yo, fuck him, man. calling us guineas...
what do you give a shit what he calls us? he's not our friend. let's just get this shit over with and go home. what's this place we're going to, jimmy?
spa?
yeah.
depends what night.
a lot of persians?
not usually. mostly trustafarians.
'trustafarians?'
you know, white kids with trust funds acting like they're poor. keeping it real. know what i mean?
i call 'em wiggers.
different.
this ruiz guy, what's his deal?
don't know much. i hear he runs a tight ship.
yeah?
understand me?
yeah.
so is this the drop?
like i said, i don't know.
he woulda told us right?
you would think.
watch out, man. sorry. i'm on the list, man.  hey, bro.

yeah, but, we're good. you know what i mean?
how is it you're good? you on a list?

ruiz isn't here.
we're supposed to meet him here. is ruiz on the list?

thanks a lot. don't worry about it.
any time, bro.
thanks.
that's him. now you all know the drill, right?
what drill?
we don't know any drill. nobody told us anything.
maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
yeah.
so we're working?
what the fuck you think, i wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? yeah you're working. and put down the champagne.
she poured it for --
far as she knows you're john gotti. now put the shit down and act like you got some ass.
he making the drop?
nah, man. he's just making contact. that's our man. the welsh guy.
what's his name?
ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. he refers to him as the red dragon.
so, when's the drop.
to be honest, man, i don't know shit either. all i know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
how do you know it's not drugs?
maxie knows i don't go near drugs. i did a minute in quentin for possession with intent. and it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
you strapped?
'strapped?'
it means you got a gun?
i know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. what the fuck you think this shit is? '21 jump street?'  cool out, they're coming back. just throw up your screw face and don't speak unless spoken to.
and here i thought you flew in some out of town muscle. how's it going, men?
so, you must be the red dragon.
well, that's news to me. the name's tom.
mmmm-hmm. where's the, uh, 'dragon's lair?' where do you live?
edinburgh.
and where might that be?
scotland.
well, word on the street is you're welsh.
i am.
a rose by any other name would --
what the fuck was you told? don't talk, right?
unless spoken to, ain't that right, horrace. didn't you say that?
don't drag my ass into this --
he spoke to me. you want me to dis him?
'dis?' 'dis?' you're not in a position to 'dis', or 'give props', or whatever your real world sense of fucking decorum tells you to do. you're nothing. you're wallpaper. you're not here to make fucking friends. asking a motherfucker where he lives. and who the fuck told you 'red dragon'?.
we get it. we're sorry.
now that limey motherfucker's jumpy and wants to change shit around on me. maxie's gonna shit a nokia when he hears about... aw, shit, i better call him before he hears.
i'm not saying shit to neither of you.
why? what i say bad?
what the fuck, 'red dragon?'
what? why am i bad?
how bad is it?
it's bad. before you even showed up, he said you were maxie's 'token goons', and not to be trusted. he wanted to tcb alone. i was gonna ride shotgun to keep the english dude above board. now he's spooked. this shit's snowballing.
when's it going down?
was gonna be tomorrow morning. now, who knows?
shit.
see you later.
you really in trouble?
stop.
i'll tell him someone else told me.
just don't ask me no more shit.
you happy?
about what?
why you gotta make everything difficult?
you too?
yeah, me too. you're a fucking bull in a china shop.
fuck this.
where do you think you're going?
back in.
you fucking nuts?
work's over. i'm gonna party.
you can't go in there. they know you're with ruiz.
you got that right.
fuck you. go then. i'm taking the car.
fine.
look who's back? want some champagne?
do not put this on ruiz's tab. start a new one.
damn right. bring us two bottles of dom champs and here, take fifty in case i call you bitch later when i'm drunk.  siddown, motherfucker.  'sex and paychecks.'
so, wait, you're from where?
manhattan.
you girls aren't from brooklyn or anything?
no.
i don't get it. what do you do?
we're in fashion.
so you're models?
we rep lines? you know? fashion?
and you grew up in manhattan?
kinda. yeah.
what do you mean 'kinda?'
i don't know about you guys, but i'm starting to feel a really sexual vibe here.
what happened? i thought we were playing truth or dare.
look at, ladies. i could sit here and take turns throwing skittles at your ass all night. but i feel what you guys are putting out there. i'm only a mirror reflecting what i'm getting from you. and i'm saying yes to it. i'm shaking hands with it. i see the road that you're pointing down and i'm saying i'll ride shotgun. and when your foot slams on the accelerator, i won't get scared. i'll stand up and let the wind blow through my long blonde hair. with my summer dress clinging to my bosom yelling 'faster, billy! faster! drive faster! faster yet -- !'
will you leave me alone, already...? no, sean, it's over... i don't care... as a matter of fact, i am... yeah. in his hotel room...
holy shit.
i'm having fun, sean. can you handle that...? yeah. he doesn't judge me.
i don't wear a white wig, i don't carry a gavel.
that's a good idea, maybe i will!
is he cute?
he's okay.
should i fuck him?
i don't know. do whatever you want.
he's great, right. is he great?
he's alright.
i know.
but maybe that's okay. maybe that's just what you need.
what the fuck's going on?
dude, get back out there. you gotta help me get them in the hot tub.  hang on girls! just get out there. i'll be right out. you know how i do.
yeah, i know how you do. i know how you do. i've heard your kibbles and bits all fucking night. you've been shaking your ass like an unemployed clown. how the room's a boiling pot of sugar water. how you're gonna dip a string into it and make rockcandy. who wants to play 'just the tip?' dancing around like a smacked ass. oh, and that coat check girl you've been dragging around as 'insurance' doesn't even speak english.
okay. we got a lot happening here. here comes the good part... okay...
somebody's getting comfortable.
where's the surprise?
you want your surprise?
yeah. i want it.
well, come on then. it's back here.
you want to come splash around.
i'm just warning you, i can't swim.
i want to leave right now.
i didn't do anything --
what the hell did you do?
i swear to god, i didn't do anything.
oh no. what is it this time.
we used to take baths together.
come on. let's go.
what the fuck was that about?
she was jonesing for me.
hi.  it's ruiz.  yeah. so the driver knows where to go? when? we'll be down in five. no, i'll tell him. he's right there. bye.
what's up?
he wants to see us now.
where?
he said it's being arranged. he said jimmy will know.
we're getting whacked.
we're not getting whacked.
why else you think he won't tell us where the sit down is?
it's not a 'sit down.' he said he's telling us the plan.
what are you doing.
i got a bad feeling, man. i don't want to go in naked.
you gonna shank him in the shower?
is it so unrealistic to think ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? as an apology? and i don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
we're getting ahead of ourselves. we haven't gotten any sleep. let's just keep our mouthes shut and not make any mistakes. now hurry up and get your shit on so we're not late and make things worse.
put that shit out...
c'mon, man...
i swear to god, i'll fucking puke.
hey, jimmy, where they taking us?
yeah. where they gonna whack us?
jesus christ, where the fuck you been all night? you look like you got shit out in the gorilla house.
good morning.
good morning.
you think this shit's funny, ho?
nah, man...
you think it's funny, motherfucker?
don't 'easy ruiz' me. y'all turned a easter egg hunt into a butt-fuck-a- thon.  bring me four eggs benedict and a mimosa. you all want mimosas?
nah, man...
no...
four mimosas.  you'll love them. so here's the plan. i didn't say shit to maxie, cause the man has acute angina, and i don't want to get him all worked up.
he has a cute what...?
a bad heart.
i didn't tell him shit. he worries too much. i love that old jew, but he's gonna kill himself worrying. we started this shit, and we're gonna finish it.
who's gonna outfit us?
outfit? what's he talking about?
nothing, man.
you want us strapped, don't you?
last thing i want is you with a gun.
word.
what's the plan?
tom, the welsh dude --
the red dragon.
shut it, man. shut it. tom is a square. he don't but dabble in shit. maxie had me hook up a loan-back with him, through an austrian passbook account.
so, we're talking money laundering...
will you tell peter jennings to shut up and fucking listen. the shit's as routine as you get. i coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but maxie likes to do it all his way. safe. i coulda dropped the bag alone. it's only two hundred g's. but he sent you all. so i can either send you home and tell maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
let's do it.
i'm your soldier.
now listen. the gig couldn't be simpler. you carry the money to the welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. the washed money goes directly to maxie. long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
where's the drop?
you three are gonna meet him for dinner. find out if and where. now any of you motherfuckers got anything else to say?
yeah.
what?
when all this is over and we're not working for maxie, i'd love to run into you on the street.  why aren't you coming?
that's none of your fucking business.
why isn't ruiz coming?
this welsh dude is tripping on ruiz cause he's a shot caller.
what's that?
a shot caller. a boss, a capo. he's running shit.
yeah.
the welsh dude, sees all these niggers in perms and diamonds and shit, he gets nervous. but you motherfuckers, he just laughs. all beat up in your babaloo suit like fruitpie the magician.
so we just go eat with him and that's gonna solve everything?
dude, you just gotta settle your shit down. you gotta go and say all that 'red dragon' shit. make him think he's on barretta.
like you were doing any better shucking and jiving like you were waiting for wings outside the quick and split.
so what do we do?
we go and hang out with the dude, make him happy, drink some tea, whatever it takes, until he feels comfortable enough to bring it up on his own. we make the drop, go home to california.
where is this happening?
we meet at the globe on park avenue at six forty-five. i'll see you then.
let's check out the penguins.
the what?
the penguin house.
wait a minute. you want to look at fucking penguins now?
yeah. let's look at the penguins.
did you hear what he just said?
whatever. we're here. we may as well go to the penguin house.
i'm tired and i'm scared, and i'm not looking at fucking penguins.
we need guns.
we don't need guns.
i'm pretty sure we do.
i listened extremely carefully. nothing was even vaguely implied. he even laughed in your face when you asked him
all the more reason.
you wouldn't even know where to get one.
wanna bet?
you couldn't even get a hand job from bridge and tunnel posse, how you gonna get a gun?
that's cause you decided to get all tired all of a sudden.
it was six in the fucking morning.
float me a hundred bucks.
why?
you wanna see how fast i get a gun?
you're out of money?
no.
what do you have left?
eighty.
eighty bucks?!?
eighty five.
what happened to the fifteen hundred?
you coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
i did! i paid for half the fuckin drinks!
you did?
yes i did. you asshole! what about the room?
what about it?
they only cover one fifty in incidentals. you've been ordering fucking... motherfucker...
calm down.
i fucking vouched for you. i vouched for you and you fucked me.
this shit's peanuts compared to what we're gonna make with maxie.
ricky. i'm trying to save this money. understand? i'm trying to make it so my girlfriend doesn't have to grind her ass into other men's erections so her daughter can go to private school.
i'm sorry...
this is horseshit. it coulda been so easy.
it's gonna be fine.
no more, man.
let's get some sleep. that's what we need, man. sleep.
how we gonna sleep? we only got a few hours til dinner.
so what do we do?
let's just go now and wait.
three and a half hours?
i don't want to take any more chances.
let's just go get guns, i'd feel better.
don't fuck around. you're gonna get us all killed.
think about it: you knocked out that jewish kid's tooth, cost him eight grand, maybe more. maybe lost his whole line of clientele? he knows you're fucking up jess' dancing, and i got a feeling he knows i stole his carpet cleaning van by the way he looks at me. he can't kill us in la cause that leads to too many questions. so he flies us out here first class for a 'drop' that's turned into whatever? he can make us disappear out here real nice...
where do you get this shit?
scenario b. i think i'm getting under ruiz's skin. i'm no dummy. he doesn't like how it went down with the red drag -- welshman, whatever. now i got fruitpie the magician telling me i can't call my man max? and that welshman's sketchy.  whatever, i don't know where it's coming, which way it's coming from, i'm telling you one thing right now, i'm not gonna be late for the dance.
you're not getting a gun.
look. they're together. you telling me this ain't a set-up?
easy...
hey, boys.
tom. how's it going?
fine, fine. and you were...?
bobby and ricky.
right, right. the 'thugs.'
and where is...?
ruiz? oh, he ain't here.
no?
nah, see, maxie just asked him to set that shit up as a favor. he, you know, he tied in with the club. set us up so, you know, you feel at home.
well, i didn't care for the club much. and, i must say, i didn't care for him either.
well, he ain't gonna be around no more.
pity. what's say we have a drink?
dip?
yeah. this shit's fucking brilliant. i just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. i gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. it's illegal back home, you know.
no shit?
does anyone want another?
you want another drink?
i'll get it.
who's up for a night on the town.
sure. anyplace in particular?
i hear the china club is a laugh.
what do you want?
a little charlie, perhaps.
coke?
i've heard you've got the best coke in the states. the shit back home is pants.
that shouldn't be a problem.
sorry, mates. now there isn't even enough to go around...
don't worry, man. it's all for you.
no, really, mate?
here...
ow, shit...
watch it...
c'mon...
fuck...
now, here's what worries me. he said he wants to meet up at a bar in red hook. you know where that is?
no.
brooklyn.
yeah?
he must have that shit troughed.
what do you mean 'troughed?'
troughed off. protected. like, you know, like he got a moat around it.
ruiz tied in out there?
nah, man. no one is. they got some puerto ricans and a new crop of fuckin irish immigrants.
i'm half irish.
i don't fuck with those crazy, off- the-boat fuckin irish. you heard of the westies?.
heard of them.
they ran shit back in the eighties. used to cut motherfuckers heads off and sit them on the bar. that's back when the irish was making a play against the italians. i don't know if they still around, but i don't fuck with those motherfuckers just in case.
it sounds to me like everybody's just a little jumpy. and since all it is is a drop, the welshman's got nothing at stake. i say we go to his 'troughed off' bar. it'll calm his nerves, we drop the bag, and we all get back to our lives.
and not a word to maxie. he'll shit if he knew we crossed a bridge.
hello.
chloe?
uncle bobby?
hi, baby. what are you doing awake? where's mommy?
i don't know.
mommy's not home?
no.
what time is it there?
can you take me to color me mine?
yeah. are you sure mommy's not home? it's very late.
i gotta go, baby. i love you. tell mommy i called. you be a big girl and be careful when you're alone.
i love you. come home.
aren't we waiting for ricky?
ricky's taken care of.
taken care of?
yeah, he's getting there on his own.
where we going?
quick drop. in and out.
where's ricky?
ricky's taken care of.
how so?
he was uptown when i paged him. i gave him the address. he's meeting us there.
that it?
that's it.
this is it.
where's ricky.
i guess inside. or he never made it. either way, i don't give a shit. let's get this over with.
here they are, then.
how's it going?
brilliantly. care for a pint?
no, thanks, man. we got to head out.
come, now. you just got here.
that's alright, man. it's a little early for me to drink.
sorry about that. where's your mate?
couldn't make it. here's the money.
i can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
no, man, that's fine. just put that you took delivery.
i... i just hired these guys to watch my back...
motherfucker, we're handing you money. what the hell we gonna pull?
holy shit. get me back to manhattan.
take us right to kennedy. now.
i never intended to test you two to that extent, but you both came through. i should've been informed there was a flag on the play, but i'll take that up with ruiz. i made a few calls back east. those punks weren't tied in with anyone. as for the welshman, he wasn't in on it. he was just plain dumb. as for you, ricky, your draw will go towards a new carpet cleaning van.
but, max --
we're square.
yes, sir.
and, as for you, bobby, you just moved up a notch. your days of fighting for crumbs is through. take a week off, come back, and we'll talk about the next thing.
there won't be a next thing.
take a few days --
i don't need a few days. i'm gonna settle down with jess. she's through dancing. we're opening a restaurant.
i hate to ruin your fairy tale, but i've been paying jess' rent for six months. she's got to keep dancing --
dude, we were practically made...
i'll drop you off in a minute. i want to see if the baby's up. you wanna come in?
no. i'll wait here.
i'll be a minute.
i -- i -- i... don't...
i don't get it.
i never promised you anything.
how could you let her see this?
goodbye, bobby.
just so you know, i bought you out with maxie. i suggest you leave while you can.
don't you get it? i don't want to leave. this is who i am.
tell you the truth, i don't give a shit for me. but that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
take her.
what'd you say?
i want you to take her with you.
