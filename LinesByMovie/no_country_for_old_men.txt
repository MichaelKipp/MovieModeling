why would we go to odessa?
not we, you. stay with your mother.

hyah!
...i love you more'n more, ever day.
that is very nice.
...be careful.
i always am.
do not get hurt.
i never do.
do not hurt no one.
well. if you say so.
you would not think a car would burn like that.
yessir. we should a brought wieners.
does that look to you like about a '77 ford, wendell?
it could be.
I would say it is. not a doubt in my mind.
the old boy shot by the highway?
yessir, his vehicle. man killed lamar's deputy, took his car, killed someone on the highway, swapped for his car, and now here it is and he is swapped again for god knows what.
that is very linear sheriff.
well. old age flattens a man.
yessir. but then there is this other. he nods up the ridge away from the highway.
uh-huh.
...you ride winston.
you sure?
oh, I am more than sure. anything happens to loretta's horse i can tell you right now you do not wanna be the party that was aboard.
i know this truck. belongs to a feller named moss.
llewelyn moss?
that is the boy.
you figure him for a dope runner?
yes, appears to have been a glitch or two.
what calibers you got there, sheriff?
nine millimeter. couple of .45 acp's.
...somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun.
mm.
...how come do you reckon the coyotes am not been at 'em?
i do not know...

no. probably i don't.
it is a mess, am not it sheriff?
yessir?
I am looking for llewelyn moss.

yes i did.
well I would say he is at work. do you want to leave a message?
where does he work?
i can not say.
where does he work?
sir i am not at liberty to give out no information about our residents.
where does he work?
did you not hear me? we can not give out no information.
why all the way to del rio?
I am going to borrow a car. from eldon.
you can not afford one?
do not wanna register it. I will call you in a couple days.
promise?
yes i do.
i got a bad feelin', llewelyn.
well i got  a good one. so they ought to even out. quit worrying about everthing.
mama's going to raise hell.
uh-huh.
she is just going to cuss you up'n down.
you should be used to that.
I am used to lots of things, i work at wal-mart.

llewelyn?
yes ma'am?
you are comin back, am not ya?
i shall return.
we goin' in?

I am hidin' behind you.
...i believe they have done lit a shuck.

that from the lock?
probably must be.
so when was he here?
i do not know. oh.
...now that is aggravating.
sheriff?
sheriff, that is aggravating.
I am ahead of you there.
you think this boy moss has got any notion of the sorts of sons of bitches that are huntin' him?
i do not know. he ought to...
you tell me the option.
the what?
the option.
...you pick the option with the applicable rate.
I am just one person. do not matter the size of the bed.
hello?

llewelyn?! no he ain't.
you expect him?
do not stop. just ride me up past the rooms.
what room?
just drive me around. i want to see if someone is here.
...keep going. do not stop.
i do not want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.
it is all right.
why do not i set you down here and we will not argue about it.
i want you to take me to another motel.
let's just call it square.
what was the bullet?
was not no bullet.
was not no bullet?
yessir. was not none.
well, wendell, with all due respect, that do not make a whole lot of sense.
no sir.
you said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound.
yes sir.
are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife?
sir, i do not want to picture that.
well i do not either!
yes noreen you better had. thank you.
the rangers and dea are heading out to the desert this morning. you going to join 'em?
i do not know. any new bodies accumulated out there?
no sir.
well then i guess i can skip it. heavens to betsy, wendell, you already put me off my breakfast.
twelve gauge. you need shells? moss looks the gun over.
uh-huh. double ought.
they will give you a wallop.
tent poles.
uh-huh.
you already have the tent?
somethin' like that.
well you give me the model number of the tent i can order you the poles.
never mind.  i want a tent.
what kind of tent?
the kind with the most poles.
well i guess that would be our ten-foot backyard per-gola. you can stand up in it. well, some people could stand up in it. six foot clearance at the ridge. you might just could.
let me have that one. where is the nearest hardware store?
could i get another room.
you want to change rooms?
no, i want to keep my room, and get another one.
another additional.
uh-huh.you got a map of the rooms?
what about one forty-two.
you can have the one next to yours if you want. one twenty.  it am not took.
no, one forty-two.
that is got two double beds.
how did you find it?
no me mate.
yessir, that is correct. i know 'em when i see 'em.
when did you last see him.
november the 28th, last year.
you seem pretty sure of the date. did i ask you to sit?
no sir but you struck me as a man who would not want to waste a chair. i remember dates. names. numbers. i saw him on november 28th.
we got a loose cannon here. and we are out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
yessir. i understand that.
yessir.
if your expenses run higher i hope you will trust us for it.
okay.
how well do you know chigurh.
well enough.
that is not an answer.
what do you want to know?
I would just like to know your opinion of him. in general. just how dangerous is he?
he killed three men in a motel in del rio yesterday. and two others at that colossal goatfuck out in the desert.
okay. we can stop that.
you seem pretty sure of yourself. you have led something of a charmed life have not you mr. wells?
...i'm wondering...
yes?
can i get my parking ticket validated?
...an attempt at humor, i suppose.
I am sorry.
goodbye, mr. wells.
one room, one night.
that is twenty-six dollars.
you on all night?
yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning.
I am waitin' to hear your description of that.
there is somebody lookin' for me. not police. just call me if anyone else checks in tonight.
...this month's checks.
that dea agent called again. you do not want to talk to him?
I am goin' to try and keep from it as much as i can.
he is goin' back out there and he wanted to know if you wanted to go with him.
...could i get you to call loretta and tell her I have gone to odessa? goin' to visit with carla jean moss.
yes sheriff.
I will call loretta when i get there. I would call now but she will want me to come home and i just might.
you want me to wait til you have quit the building?
yes i do. you do not want to lie without what it is absolutely necessary.
...what is it that torbert says? about truth and justice?
we dedicate ourselves daily anew. something like that.
i think I am goin' to commence dedicatin' myself twice daily. it may come to three times before it is over...
...don't worry. I am not the man that is after you.
i know, I have seen him. sort of.
...but that will not last.
what is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
i do not think that is how i would describe him.
how would you describe him?
i guess I would say... that he does not have a sense of humor.  his name is chigurh.
sugar?
chigurh. anton chigurh. you know how he found you?
i know how he found me.
it is called a transponder.
i know what it is. he will not find me again.
not that way.
not any way.
took me about three hours.
i been immobile.
no. you do not understand.
...what do you do?
I am retired.
what did you do?
I am a welder.
acetylene? mig? tig?
any of it. if it can be welded i can weld it.
cast iron?
yes.
i do not mean braze.
i did not say braze.
pot metal?
what did i say?
were you in nam?
yeah. i was in nam.
so was i.
so what does that make me? your buddy?
look. you need to give me the money. I have got no other reason to protect you.
too late. i spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it i just sort of blew it in.
why would he go to odessa?
to kill your wife.
maybe he should be worried. about me.
he isn't. you are not cut out for this. you are just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
...you did not take the product, did you?
what product.
the heroin. you do not have it.
no i do not have it.
no. you don't.
...i'm across the river. at the hotel eagle. carson wells.  call me when you have had enough. i can even let you keep a little of the money.
if i was cuttin' deals, why would not i go deal with this guy chigurh?
no no. no. you do not understand. you can not make a deal with him. even if you gave him the money he would still kill you. he is a peculiar man. you could even say that he has principles. principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. he is not like you. he is not even like me.
he do not talk as much as you, i give him points for that.
do not know why i did. i told you, i do not know where he is.
you am not heard from him?
no i ain't.
nothin'?
not word one.
would you tell me if you had?
well, i do not know. he do not need any trouble from you.
it is not me he is in trouble with.
who is he in trouble with then?
some pretty bad people.
llewelyn can take care of hisself.
these people will kill him, carla jean. they will not quit.
he will not neither. he never has.
i wish i could say that was in his favor. but i have to say i do not think it is.
he can take all comers.
why you tellin' me that, sheriff?
i do not know. my mind wanders.
we do not have to do this. I am a daytrader. i could just go home.
why would i let you do that?
i know where the money is.
if you knew, you would have it with you.
i need dark. to get it. i know where it is.
i know something better.
what is that.
i know where it is going to be.
and where is that.
it will be brought to me and placed at my feet.
you do not know to a certainty. twenty minutes it could be here.
i do know to a certainty. and you know what is going to happen now. you should admit your situation. there would be more dignity in it.
you go to hell.
do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
you mean the nature of this conversation?
i mean the nature of you.
who is this.
you know who it is.
...you need to talk to me.
i do not need to talk to you.
i think that you do. do you know where I am going?
why would i care where you are going.
do you know where I am going?
...i know where you are.
yeah? where am i?
you are in the hospital across the river. but that is not where I am going. do you know where I am going?
yeah. i know where you are going.
all right.
you know she will not be there.
it does not make any difference where she is.
so what are you goin' up there for.
you know how this is going to turn out, do not you?
no. do you?
yes, i do. i think you do too. so this is what I will offer. you bring me the money and I will let her go. otherwise she is accountable. the same as you. that is the best deal you are going to get. i will not tell you you can save yourself because you can't.
yeah I am goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I have decided to make you a special project of mine. you am not goin' to have to look for me at all.
yessir. none of the three had id on 'em but they are tellin' me all three is mexicans. was mexicans.
there is a question. whether they stopped bein'. and when.
yessir.
now, wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock?
yessir. it was punched out.
okay.
you gonna drive out there?
no, that is the only thing i would have looked for. and it sounds like these boys died of natural causes.
how is that, sheriff?
natural to the line of work they was in.
yessir.
my lord, wendell, it is just all-out war. i  do not know any other word for it. who are these folks? i do not know...
who do you think gets through this gate into the united states of america?
i do not know. american citizens.
some american citizens. who do you think decides?
you do, i reckon.
that is correct. and how do i decide?
i do not know.
i ask questions. if i get sensible answers then they get to go to america. if i do not get sensible answers they don't. is there anything about that that you do not understand?
no sir.
then i ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes.
i got an overcoat on.
are you jackin' with me?
no sir.
do not jack with me.
yes sir.
are you in the service?
no sir. I am a veteran.
nam?
yes sir. two tours.
what outfit.
twelfth infantry batallion. august seventh nineteen and sixty-six to july second nineteen and sixty-eight.
good. i need everything else.
okay.
you get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
no sir, it is unusual.
llewelyn?
hey.
what should i do?
you know what is goin' on?
i do not know, i had the sheriff here from terrell county --
what did you tell him?
what did i know to tell him. you are hurt, am not you?
what makes you say that?
i can hear it in your voice.
llewelyn, i am not going to leave you in the lurch.
no. this works better. with you gone and i do not have the money, he can not touch me. but i can sure touch him. after i find him I will come and join you.
find who? what am i supposed to do with mother?
she will be all right.
she will be all right?
...me?
yes.
nobody. accounting.
he gave acosta's people a receiver.
he feels... he felt... the more people looking...
that is foolish. you pick the one right tool.
...for instance. i used birshot. so as not to blow the window.
i see.
it am not even three years we been married.
three years ago i said them very words. no and good.
i got it mama.
i did not see my prednizone.
i put it in, mama.
well i did not see it.
well i put it in. that one. you just set there. I will get tickets and a cart for the bags.
who is charlie walser. oh! well, i, uh... true story? i could not swear to ever detail but... it is certainly true that it is a story.
yeah, right. sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
yes ma'am?
if i tell you where llewelyn's headed, you promise it will be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
yes ma'am, i do.
llewelyn would never ask for help. he never thinks he needs any.
carla jean, i will not harm your man. and he needs help, whether he knows it or not.
yeah, that will suck some power. over time.
you from around here?
what airport would you use.
huh? airport or airstrip?
airport.
well -- where ya goin'?
i do not know.
just lightin' out for the territories, huh. brother, i been there... well...
that is me.
i got beers in my room.
waitin' for my wife.
oh. that is who you keep lookin' out the window for?
half.
what else then?
lookin' for what is comin'.
yeah but no one ever sees that. i like a man that will tell you he is married.
then you will like me.
i do like you.
carla jean...
no.
i thought maybe she was with your boy there.
no id in her room?
not hardly nothin' in her room. and that establishment was no stickler on registration. well...
no money in his room there?
couple hundred on his person. those hombres would have taken the stash.
i suppose. though they was leavin' in a hurry.
it is all the goddamned money, ed tom. the money and the drugs.  it is just goddamned beyond everything. what is it mean? what is it leading to?
yes.
if you would a told me twenty years ago I would see children walkin' the streets of our texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses i just flat out would not of believed you.
signs and wonders. but i think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
it is the tide. it is the dismal tide. it is not the one thing.
not the one thing. i used to think i could at least some way put things right. i do not feel that way no more.
...i do not know what i do feel like.
try "old" on for size.
yessir. it may be that. in a nutshell.
none of that explains your man though.
uh-huh.
he is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, ed tom.
I am not sure he is a lunatic.
well what would you call him.
i do not know. sometimes i think he is pretty much a ghost.
he is real all right.
oh yes.
all that at the eagle hotel. it is beyond everything.
yes, he has some hard bark on him.
that do not hardly say it. he shoots the desk clerk one day, and walks right back in the next and shoots a retired army colonel.
hard to believe.
strolls right back into a crime scene. who would do such a thing? how do you defend against it?
how did you know i was here.
who else'd be in your truck.
you heard it?
how is that?
you heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
what give you that idea. i seen one of the cats heard it.
but -- how did you know it was mine?
i deduced it. once you walked in.
how many a those things you got now?
cats? several. wal. depends what you mean by got. some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
how you been, ellis?
you lookin' at it. i got to say you look older.
i am older.
got a letter from your wife. she writes pretty regular, tells me the family news.
did not know there was any.
she just told me you was quittin'. sit down.
want a cup?
'predate it.
how fresh is this coffee?
i generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there is some left over.
that man that shot you died in prison.
in angola. yeah.
what would you a done if he would been released?
i do not know. nothin'. would not be no point to it.
I am kindly surprised to hear you say that.
all the time you spend tryin' to get back what is been took from you there is more goin' out the door. after a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it.
...your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. i done that my own self. loretta says you are quittin'.
yes, you have circled round.
how come're you doin that?
i do not know. i feel overmatched.
...i always thought when i got older god would sort of come into my life in some way. he didn't. i do not blame him. if i was him I would have the same opinion about me that he does.
you do not know what he thinks.
yes i do.
...shot down on his own porch there in hudspeth county. there was seven or eight of 'em come to the house. wantin' this and wantin' that. mac went back in and got his shotgun but they was way ahead of him. shot him down in his own doorway.  aunt ella run out and tried to stop the bleedin'. him tryin to get hold of the shotgun again. they just set there on their horses watchin' him die. finally one of 'em says somethin' in injun and they all turned and left out. well mac knew the score even if aunt ella didn't. shot through the left lung and that was that. as they say.
when did he die?
nineteen zero and nine.
no, i mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
believe it was that night. she buried him the next mornin'.  diggin' in that hard caliche.
...what you got am not nothin' new. this country is hard on people. hard and crazy. got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account.
most don't.
you are discouraged.
i'm... discouraged.
you can not stop what is comin. am not all waitin' on you.
no.
i am not got the money.
no.
what little i had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. i buried my mother today. i am not paid for that neither.
i would not worry about it.
...i need to sit down.
...you got no cause to hurt me.
no. but i gave my word.
you gave your word?
to your husband.
that do not make sense. you gave your word to my husband to kill me?
your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. instead, he used you to try to save himself.
not like that. not like you say.
i do not say anything. except it was foreseen.
i knowed you was crazy when i saw you settin' there. i knowed exactly what was in store for me.
yes. things fall into place.
maybe I will go ridin.
okay.
what do you think.
i can not plan your day.
i mean, would you care to join me.
lord no. I am not retired.
...how'd you sleep?
i do not know. had dreams.
well you got time for 'em now. anything interesting?
well they always is to the party concerned.
ed tom, I will be polite.
okay. two of 'em. both had my father. it is peculiar. I am older now'n he ever was by twenty years. so in a sense he is the younger man. anyway, first one i do not remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and i think i lost it. the second one, it was like we was both back in older times and i was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
