why do i always have to sit in back?
it is just the way things are, kiddo.
well, i would like to sit in front today.
it is not going to happen.
how is your precious little school-marm today?
she is fine, as if you cared.
tell me something... what is a school teacher doing having you meet for breakfast in one of the filthiest parts of downtown skank-ville?  i mean, this is not the place for fine dining, unless looking at prostitutes stimulates your appetite.
filthy kids go to kindergarten too. what are you saying, anyhow?
nothing, i guess.  just an observation.  she is really something special.  you are a lucky fella.
lay off once, would you?
what did i say?
it is the way you say it, like there is something more too it.
you been wearing rubbers, billy-boy?
wha... ?
birth control's important.
what... what kinda thing is that to say?
she is right.  if you two are doing the horizontal polka, the last thing you want is a thirty-five pound bundle-of-joy stumbling around, knocking over furniture and calling you "daddy."
jeez... it is too early in the morning for this.  leave off.  here's your paper.
what, am i supposed to read it while i drive?  keep a grip on it, alright?
you know, the more weight back there, the faster the car goes.
bullshit.
you never heard of physics, einstein? the laws of physics.  the more ballast we keep closer to the rear tires...
I am back here, are not i?  so, you do not have to make up a buncha lies to make me feel good about it.
oh... okay.
pardon me... my mistake.  taking your thoughts in hand, huh... ?
whoops... do not mind me.  go ahead and finish up.
kittle...
where you been hiding, grease-fist? we have been looking for you.
what do you want?  I am clean.  i been clean a long time.
really?  is that a fact... ?
pure horse.
you are such a disappointment, benny.
oh, you fuckers!  you fucking fuckers!  what?  what do you want?
word is, while the vice cops on the east coast were standing around playing pocket pool, 300 kilos of heroin got smuggled into new york city.  and, right now it is making a cross-country journey to hollywood, u.s.a.
arriving tonight
going into zimmermann's pipeline.
hey now... what the fuck... ?
again.
know what he is doing, benny?  he is trying to jog your memory.
i do not know what you are talking about, man.  even if i did, I am not so crazy I am going to cross zimmermann.
this scag is enough to keep every junkie from here to the mexican border high as a kite for the next two years.  you think we are going to let zimmermann haul it onto our streets on the fourth-of-fucking-july!?
last time billy-boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  sad in a way. why is it we do not truly appreciate our arms and legs till we have lost the use of them?
alright!  alright... put me down...
it is bone dry out there.  everybody's hurting.  the stuff floating around's been cut so many times it is like powdered sugar, but zimnermann's going to fix it.
i need the "when" and the "where."
i do not know, okay?  all i know is butch cassidy's back in town.
you should not litter.
thank you, concerned citizen.
give a hoot.  do not pollute.
I will give you a fucking hoot if you do not shut up back there.
why do you bother with that mumbo-jumbo crap?  some fruitcake's writing it between bong hits, making it up as he goes, and you are actually taking the time to read it.
yeah, non-believer?  here's yours...  "scorpio, october 24 to november 22: jupiter is in conflict with saturn, so proceed with caution..."
look out!  jupiter and saturn'll get you every fucking time.
"today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  by your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
let me see that...  not bad.
what is mine say?
"leo.  the stages of the moon are in alignment, so now is a perfect time for a vigorous regimen of self improvement.  wash yourself more carefully each morning, stop using pies and cakes as your primary source of nourishment, and quit tucking your shirttails inside your underwear."
it does not say that.
no, but it should.
just a little, you know... bicentennial memento.  nothing special.
whoa, thanks, man.  these are cool. they will be collector's items.
yeah... great.
you know... you could say thank you.
you are the one with the star-spangled hard-on, not me.
what are you, communist?  at least numb-nuts here has the courtesy to pretend he likes them.
hey...
forgive me for not ooing cartwheels over commemorative salt and pepper shakers
i just think you should show some respect.  i mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when ben franklin and those guys signed the constitution and declaration of independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
first of all, the constitution was not writtem till 1787...
you know what i mean.
second of all, the declaration of independence was all for liberty and equality, but it did not do anything about slavery, did it?
yeah, well... nobody's perfect.  they could not go doing everything at once.
all I am saying is, your little bicentennial mementos would be more accurate if there were no holes in the pepper shaker so the pepper could not get out.
alright?
absolutely.
that is him alright.
it is go time, billy-b.
escort everyone's favorite she-male over here nice and peaceful-like. let's not have another incident like at the laundromat.  I will never forget the look on that poor woman's face.
that was not my fault.
save it.  just go.
smooth move, hot-shot.
what was i supposed to do?
i... i can not find my seatbelt.
what do you want me to do about it?
we got him.
slow down.
"go, go, go!"  "slow down."  make up your mind.
do not crowd him.
sons of bitches!
we catch 'em, i wanna be first to hurt 'em.  promise me i get to go first.
we will share.
hold your horses, sweetpea.  we need butch cassidy alive, remember?
shit.  you are right.
if they crash, maybe he will run.  you can shoot him in the leg or something.
let's hope.
I am going to get beside him.
no you are not.
I am going to get beside.  nena, you are going to shoot out his tires.
no, we are not going to do that.
i can work this.
no you can't.
get ready.
you... suck!  you almost got us all killed!
you think this is so easy?
can not be worse than you.
oh yeah?
that is right, white bread.  give it up.  right now.
okay, okay... hold on.  do not go getting your panties in a knot...
make a hole, billy-boy.
I would rather you guys did not do this again.
move it!
get closer!  do not lose him!
i kinda already figured that, but keep those helpful hints coming.
you put your bumper just behind his left tire and then accelerate... make him spin out...
is there nothing in this world you enjoy more than the sound of your own voice?
this is too fast.  this is way too fast!
relax.
we should slow down.
hands off the suit, monkey-boy. close your eyes if you are scared.
jiminy christmas.
i can not even begin to imagine how much that must have hurt.
what can we do for you, officers? what new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we will be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
thank you for sharing that charming image.
laugh it up.  you will cry later.
you will cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
could not have said it better myself.
you bust some small-time pimps, whores and dime-bag junkies, like the world's a better place because you are in it.  and for what, kittle... two hundred and fifty dollars a week? tell me, how does anyone get so self-rightious when they can barely afford to pay their rent?
just 'cause you belong to some fancy-pants club, does not make you any less a murderer.
murderer?  really?
thanks, but we do not recognize "brunch" as an actual meal.
i insist.  what will it be?  boston tea party clam chowder, or maybe the chicken red, white and cordon bleu? no...  there is a special on the menu, today only...  ... roasted pig.
your poison's not going to make it into the veins of any kids this time.
wave that flag, hero.  keep dreaming those dreams.
and, what... what am i forgetting? oh, yes... the transvestite junkie whose bullet riddled body came blasting through the front doors of the precinct house!
well, sir...
no.  do not open your mouth!  you honestly think you can explain this to my satisfaction?
i... i think i can... clarify...
do not bother.  this behavior's gone on too long.  you are suspended.
what?
it is noon straight up.  effective immediately, you three work desk jobs till midnight.
you can not be serious.
can not i?
we have been chasing this deal six months, and now you are going to chuck it out the window?
hey now, look!  let's all get on the same page here.  this shipment is do or die for zimmermann's syndicate; all or nothing.  if we stop the drugs, we do not even have to catch him red-handed.  he is ruined cause his pushers go broke with nothing to sell.  on the other hand, if we fuck this up, it means more zombies crawling the gutters than ever and a morgue that does not have a single empty drawer.  more old ladies getting mugged and molested by junk-hungry needle-freaks, and all the while zimmermann's sitting back and laughing his head off.
there'll be other chances.
not like this.  are you even listening?
do not you condescend to tell me how or why to honor independence day, and do not tell me I am overreacting when I am trying to bust the guy responsible for half the filthy junk coming into this city!
you are about an inch away from insubordination!
well... seeing how you just suspended me, what is to stop me from calling you a crazy bastard, you old fart?
till the last firework fizzles out tonight, detective, you sit a desk. and, after that, I will decide if you keep your shield.
i say, fuck 'em.  let's go.
well... we should not rush into this, right?  let's talk about it.
what are you, henry friggin' kissinger all the sudden?
I am just saying...
you are just saying nothing!  tonight is the night.
yeah, but if we do not sit, they will take our badges.
what of it?  have not we waited forever... ?  have not we, honey?  have not we waited long enough to get this scumbag?
what... ?  not you too?
he is right.  we hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
i can not believe I am hearing this,
i worked my ass off for my badge, kittle,  it is the only thing that makes me different from every other slob out there.
that is not true.
i know it is, even if you don't.
all i got is being a cop.  what do i do if I am not that?
you big, fat sonofabitch, if it were not for me, you would still be sitting in the file room where i found you.  and you... nena... you have still got needle scars from where i pulled you out of.  you of all people...
yeah, my arms healed up real good, and that is how i wanna keep 'em. that is what I am trying to tell you.
guys... all we have got is each other. do not we know that by now?
you always did have style.
it is one of a kind.
so are you, pop-sweet.  that is why...
this shit was ming.
that is the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
where is your pet gorilla and the female uncle tom?
they're... around.
yeah?  so, what do you want to ask today that i can not answer?  I am a busy man.
the way zimmermann takes such good care of you and this drug-peddling "escort service" of yours, i figure you got the scoop on the pharmaceuticals arriving tonight.
well, let me tell you how it is...
he went to pick up lunch.
well, shake a leg.  get these files downstairs...  and, quit listening to your fucking voodoo music.
yes, sir.
what the... ?!  what was that for?
follow me.
how come everyone thinks hitting me's the best way to get my attention?
where we going?
we have to find kittle.
okay.  but, what changed our mind?
just keep an eye out till i get this rig up and running.
we shoulda been there to back you up. we shoulda!
stop blaming yourself.
you need a doctor.
nothing's broke.  keep sewing.  and quit pacing, you big ox.  you are making me skittish.
let's go!  fuck everything!  god damn sons of bitching mother humpers... I am going to rip'em all brand new assholes... !
hey... hey!    cool down, jumbo!
any preferences?
whatever goes bang.
i can not believe we are stealing.
we are not stealing.  we are borrowing.
no, we are stealing.
this is the police lock-up.  we are police.  how can we steal from ourselves?
then, why did we tie him up?
let's get this thing done.
all for one...
I am going to put a great big, ear-to-fucking-ear smile on your face.  how 'bout that?
where have you been?
I am here.  that is all that counts. watch... you will enjoy this... it is like magic...
our resignations.
you going rogue on me?
maybe.
what happened, kittle?  we used to be friends.  you used to know how the game was played.
you mean taking bribes, and skimming busts and letting hoods walk? you mean not being able to sleep at night after shaking down some honest joe?
there was a time when you did things the right way, till you hooked up with that fat-assed-boozehound and the soul-sister.
alright, flesh-peddler, let's see empty hands!
out here.  on your knees.
ah, jeez, billy... careful!
i got him.
you get him?
dead.
chalk up another victory for billy-boy's one man war on crime.
who said it wa's me, hub?  anyway... he fell off a ladder.  it was not really my fault.
well, i got something..  pop-sweet's accounting ledger for the disco-strip.  all the money transactions.  look...  someone is putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  like they are acknowledging a deposit.
"a.d."
who is that?  zimmermann's money-man?
if it is, that is pretty high up on the totem pole.  what do you think?
gimmie a minute.
alright... how about you two hit the strip and start knocking some heads together?  find out who "a.d." is.  i got a quick errand to run.
sounds good.
where you gonna be?
it is personal.  we will hook up at billy-boy's pad in an hour.  see ya then.
i... i can explain...
I am looking at this poster, and I am thinkin', i do not remember seeing films like this when i was in school.
i was going to tell him.
what were you gonna say?  exactly how did you think he was gonna make the leap from dating a sweet, innocent school teacher to an ass-fucking porn star?
but... i love him.  i do...
let me tell him.  let him decide.
you are not going to see him again.
what... what makes you think you can order me around?!
maybe I am not making myself clear. you are probably the first girl billy-boy's ever fallen in love with, and i know for sure you are the first he is slept with.  so, how is he going to feel...  ... when he finds out that the only first he is for you is the first guy who did not have to pull out at the last second to get his close-up?
has not he got enough problems, or did not you notice that is not cream soda on his breath?
... okay... you made your point.
you live like a pig.
can not you say something nice once?
okay.  it does not smell as bad in here as i remember it smelling.
been waiting long?
just got here.
how did we do?
a.d. is a c.p.a.
come again... ?
archibald dobbs; certified public accountant.  but, that is all we got.
maybe it is enough.
no offices are gonna be open today.
lots of these pencil-pushers work out of their homes.  it is a tax dodge.
bad news is, word's spreading like wildfire that we do not have badges, and nobody wants to end up getting splattered like butch cassidy either.
if we do not catch a break soon, we are going to be left standing with our dicks in our hands.
speak for yourself.
whoa, whoa... it is going to be alright.
... where... where is a jerk like me ever going to find another girl to love him... huh?...
do not talk like that.  there is plenty of women around for jerks like you.
you are lying...
okay, we got... one, two... three...  two caddies and poe's mustang.
could be worse.  i do not know how, but I am sure it could.
you plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
I am waiting till the time's right.
get his attention.
your wish is my command.
hey-ho... !  maybe we are not alone in this thing after all.
who is that... ?
what the hell's his problem?
you mean, besides the warrant out on us for blowing up our commanding officer?
remember those two uniform cops who been giving us such a hard time... ?
yeah.
the ones you got in that fist-fight with a couple a weeks ago... ?
yeah.
that is them trying to kill us.
well, they sure know how to hold a grudge.
you're... you are not doing what i think you are doing... ?
seatbelts fastened, please.
look, kittle... pull over and let me out.  I will be fine... okay?  how 'bout that... ?  oh, lord almighty, listen to me... i do not want to die!!  lemme out of this coffin!!
clench your teeth.
wh... what... ?!
clench your teeth so when we land you do not accidentally bite off your tongue.
that is sick.
welcome to beverly hills. wife-swapping capital of the world.
this is private property.  this is breaking and entering!
just entering.  we will get to the breaking in a minute.
you are zimmermann's calculator, archie.  all the blood money you had to move around to make this deal, you got to know something.  maybe they told you, maybe you overheard things you were not supposed to hear...
I am telling you, you are barking up the wrong tree.
well, I am running out of trees, so look me in the eye like a man and tell me you do not know!  convince me!
i do not know.  fuck off!
you suck at lying, archie.
see... now that we know you know, the hard part's done for us.
it is just a question of how long do we have to slap you silly till you spill the beans.
we are screwed.
I am well aware of that.
what is the plan?
beats me.  you got a suggestion, feel free to shout it out, genius.
indivisible and inseparable.
incestuous.
every person's got their own kinks, beef-cake.  what is wrong, kittle?  you do not swing?
what eve and i would not give to meet up with you on the business end of a daisy chain.
put up your kickstand, freak.  start talking, or we are out the door.
a little birdie whispered in my ear today... about the needle-candy you are chasing.  it is up here...  ... in the old curiosity shop.
how much?
i figure, for this information, the usual payment... times ten.
you think it is that good?
I will tell you what... i think it is all you have got.
well... what can i do?  you have created a dilemma...  and, look at the that. time's running out.  i wonder... how can i impress upon you just exactly how frustrating this situation is for me?
you get nothing and like it.  and if we are not blissfully happy with what you tell us, we arrest you just for the fun of it.
okay, man, okay.  I am with you.  i... i heard how the shit's arriving...  it is coming in a lincoln.
and... ?
what and?  that is what i got.
a lincoln?  what lincoln?  lincoln continental?  lincoln mark five... six... ?
now you know what to watch for...
am i supposed to take this information and sit up in the hills with a frickin' telescope?
this much powder you do not throw in the trunk with a blanket over it. it is got to be smuggled.
there is not even enough places to stash it in a car.
have i ever steered you wrong?
cuff'em.  let's see what these two love birds say once they are sitting in separate cages.
take her down to the car, and for christ's sake be careful this time.  last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  what a mess.  why is it we do not appreciate our arms and legs till we have lost the use of them?
hey, listen... I will give you something else, kittle.  anything. remember... remember that corpse washed up on huntington beach?  it was never identified...
who cares?
alright, wait... there is a dentist in brentwood peddling morphine...
careful she does not hit her head on the way.
come on, do not you screw with her, please!  you... you got to want this: armored car job.  caltrust bank. they took two million in cash...
read my lips: zimmermann or nothing.
we will take the caltrust heist, but if it is no good, we will hunt you down, and billy-boy will pull out your spine and he will beat you to death with it.
fair enough.
when you planning to cut back on that?
what?
the booze.
i do not know.  i could quit now if i wanted, i just do not want to.
i do not know what the problem is. plenty of great men throughout history got their bravery out of a bottle
name one.
dean martin.
entertainers do not count.
what about jack daniels?  was not he a decorated general in the civil war?
no.
general jim beam, then.
nope.
oh.  well.   i think it is pretty common knowledge that in the battle of little big horn, custer was drunk off his ass.
who is been giving you history lessons?  your bartender?
okay, seriously.  what about napoleon, huh?
what about him?
you have never heard of napoleon brandy, mister smarty-pants?  how do you think it got its name?
billy, i love you i really do... but I have got to tell you, every day, in every way, you give new meaning to the word "stupidity."
what can i say to that... except, i love you too, you mean-spirited bitch.
you could start over again with cash like that.
go wherever you want.  live how you want.
no more counting the big money for someone else.
beholden to none.
it is six o'clock.  time's runaing out.  decide.
if i tell you, how do i know you will not just club me and take it back?
you don't.  it is a gamble.  but, not even in vegas are you going to get close to this kind of cash.  this is two million, archie.  it is not three houses, it is twelve.  it is dreams come true.
three hundred kilos of white lady hidden inside a giant bust of abraham lincoln.  a parade float.
what... ?
abe lincoln...
they... they shot me.
they shot us all, kid.
what day is it?
same day as before.  i think.
where we going?
we are going to rain on zimmermann's parade.
how you doing back there?
feeling great.
feels like there is a bullet still in my chest.
there probably is.
bummer.
think zimmermann's watching?
who the fuck knows?  we will find out soon enough.
you john-wilkes-booth-ed him.
billy!  billy!
why the beach?
so there is nobody around to get killed in the explosion.
oh, yeah... the explosion.
know what i love about dynamite?
do tell.
when you bunch it together, it is exponentially more powerful.  two sticks have the power of four sticks. four sticks have the power of sixteen, and so on.
i do not think so.
well, that is what i heard, and that is what i choose to believe.
the gang's all here!
keep 'em busy.
gimmie a butt.
you do not smoke.
I am not taking a cigarette break, jackass, just give me one!
you fuckers... damn you!  why?!  why me!?  why the obsession with me?
it is our job.
you think you accomplished something... like you are heroes? fuck you!   this is meaningless! you will never win!  you know, as soon as I am gone... someone is going to take my place.
he tried to kill us.
we have got the tape to prove it.
you see that?
yeah.
good.  thought i was imagining them.
happy independence day.
yeah.  happy fourth of july.
