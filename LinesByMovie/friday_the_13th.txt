you said we were special.
i meant everything.
you know what i said, though.
i can't, barry...
i would not know.
oh, you...
claudette...
somebody'll see.
no, they won't...
somebody is there, barry.
come on, claudette. a man's not made of stone.
let's go back, barry...
i need you so much, claudette.
sex is all you ever think of, neddy.
there you are dead wrong.
ha!
sometimes i only think about kissing women.
ow!
i was just wondering if you thought there would by any other gorgeous women at camp crystal lake. besides yourself.
how about our last jay?
good call.
what about the dope paragraph in mr. christy's letter?
quote: controlled substances are expressly forbidden. possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal. unquote.
it is beautiful...
yeah, and it also look like it has not seen a coat of paint in six years.
cabin b is ready.
push on this side. alice, this is jack, marcie and ned. push.
that is got her. thanks. I am steve christy. welcome to camp crystal lake. you got some grubby clothes? climb into 'em. alice, see if bill has cleaned out the boathouse. i want him to start with the canoes. what happened to brenda?
you told her to sweep the courts.
steve said for you to start on the boats.
i finished the boats.
alice? the others show up?
everybody except the girl who is supposed to handle the kitchen. annie.
you think you are going to last all summer?
I am not sure I will last all week.  I will tell steve.
you draw very well.
oh, thanks. i wish i could spend more time at it.
any particular reason?
just a feeling.  nothing personal.
you want to leave?
i do not know. probably be best for everybody.
you may not care a lot about this place, alice, but i mean to make it my whole life. it is been my whole life. gimme a chance. stay a week. help get it ready. next friday, if you are not happy, I will put you on the bus myself. I will be grateful.
next friday.
thanks, alice.
I have got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I will be back around ten. if you are still up, we can talk, okay?
sure.
how come?
some campers drowned. then some counselors got killed.
did anyone ever tell you you are beautiful when you are angry?
i do not believe you...
want to see my trick shot? it is even better.
you ever fire one of those bows again, and I will tack you up on the wall to dry.
god, but i love that sexy talk.
steve said you were thinking of leaving. true?
un-hunh.
oh, my god...
you okay?
how come you are leaving?
it is long and personal. it has nothing to do with you or the other kids.
maybe i can help?
and it is this place. it makes no sense, but it spooks me.
you are right. it makes no sense.
what do you want to be when you grow up?
dancer.
cowboy.
girls can not be cowboys.
okay, fireman.
jack?
coach, athletic director somewhere.
filmmaker.
artist.
doctor. now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be?
rocky road.
what did you see?
i do not know. marcie's got me paranoid.
it still hurts?
i walked into it knowing I would get hurt, but i thought i could stand anything.  i just was not ready for that kind of pain. we were supposed to meet in l.a. when i got back there, he sent a telegram saying he was going back to his wife.
what will you do when you leave here?
i do not know.
I will be along.
do not burn that gorgeous body, or I will scratch your eyes out...
holy shit...
we would not want you thinking you are the only show-off in camp, would we?
i did not know i was asleep... what time is it?
almost five.
you can only do what you can do.
and then steve looks at you with those hurt eyes -- like you do not care about children...
how the... did he get in there?
slipped in. probably liked the scent of your perfume.
what the hell?
where did you get that stuff?
it is going to be a long summer.
wait, wait! when i was finding these goodies in the shed. i also found this letter which a camper never sent home. listen.
no wonder they lost america. how could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? what is to eat?
whatever you make yourself.
trouble?
bad bulb or no power. it is getting a little gloomy in here.
steve taught me how to use the emergency generator. the town power lines are supposed to be real shitty.
god, but i love that macho talk! emergency generators! the indian used campfires.
give me a hand?
for sure.
this is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in maine.
here we go.
I will be okay. holy shit...
do not get up. take a second...
you saved my life.
i had to.
thanks.
i figured if i did not save you. I would have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.
floor probably leaks. this area is full of springs.
a short somewhere.
what hath god wrought?
that was the telephone.
ha! you wily oriental! the phone was "mr. watson, come in here, i need you." "what hath god wrought" was the telegraph.
last line of gone with the wind?
frankly, scarlet, i do not give a damn!
shows how much you know. it is something about tomorrow.
tomorrow is another day.
right! right!
you okay?
those things can be nasty.
melvin belli.
i was careless.
what is it?
is it stuck?
roll him over!
get behind him more.
wait'll you are really in trouble and see what happens...
but it is in the brochure! "camp crystal lake has a full drama program." you just saw it.
chance to get even?
I will spot you five points.
I am sorry.
ned? we are going to be working together for a while. you are a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay?
sure.
I am going to go lie down and catch some z's. today wiped me out.  thanks, alice.
you are welcome.
you just had some lucky shots.
where is ned?
just a walk, for chrissakes.
boy, we sure do have a lot of filthy small-minded people around here.  wait a minute, I will get my diaphragm and be right with you.
wind's up. it is shifted a good hundred and eighty degrees.
makes me want to hold on and never let go.
i love you.
i love you.
what about neddy?
i do not love neddy.
he keeps on acting like such an asshole!
ned!
do not call him.
i thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures. ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know.
i guess...
looks like a storm.
I am a little scared of storms. always have been. since i was a kid.
you? the brick?
it is just a dream.
i call it my shower dream.
this is no dream. want to escape for a while?
lead the way!
are you wet?
just a little. wait a minute, woman.
jack and marcie are gonna be drenched.
not if they are where i think they are.
mmmmmmmph?
mmmmmmmph.
best over...
umhummmmph.
like waves. it is never been likes waves before.
whassamatta?
got to pee. you are lying on my bladder.
anything else you want?
no, thanks. I am fine. sandy.
you can not go back there tonight. not in that stuff. 'less you wanta get drownded.
i got to.
aw.
i have six new counsellor up there. they are all babes in the woods in every sense of the word.
they will be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain.
how much do i owe you?
one night on the town.
i mean...
...i know what you mean. two and a quarter. plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone.
yeah. i got it on before this --  -- all started.
that is thirty percent.
for two lonely nights.
it would not matter except steve should be getting back pretty soon. it would not look so great if he fell over them.
good point.
well, it has not been that long.
i think we should go wake them up. just in case.
give them a little while longer. it is still early, anyway.
i guess...
good night, alice.
good night, brenda.
help you clean up?
absolutely.
i told you not to buy that hunk of junk!
i think water got into the electrical system. you ride me back to camp? I will get one of my counselors to drive me back tomorrow morning.
why not?
i do not hear it anymore.
can not hear anything through that wind and rain.
it sounded like brenda.
I will go take a look.
did somebody leave the lights on at the softball field?
where?
they are off now.
I will go check on brenda.
okay.
bad enough we got a full moon; it is friday the 13th. they keep statistics. we get more accidents, more robberies, more rapes, more homicides, more of everything when there is a full moon. it affects people. makes 'em nuts.
you have made a science out of coincidence.
have to drop you here, steve.
sure.
good luck.
another coincidence.
yeah.
jack?
marcie?
hey, guys!
it is dead. try the pay phone.
do you have a dime? a quarter?
no. there must be some in the desk somewhere.
what is the matter with it?
wet. i do not know.
why do not we run? just run now?
it is over twenty miles to the crossroads. steve'll be back in an hour. things will straighten out then. we will take his jeep and get help.
he is dead... she is dead... all dead... please save me... oh... poor bill... oh my god, oh my god... oh god...
it will be all right. I will take care of you.
jack? marcie? ned?
it is just this place. the storm. that is why you are all upset.
no, no, they are all dead...
so young, so pretty. what monster could have done such a thing?
bill -- bill -- bill is out there...
the killer is still out there.
i will protect you.
we should go now.
maybe we should wait for mr. christy.
