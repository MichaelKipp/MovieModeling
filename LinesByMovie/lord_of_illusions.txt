i've got so much power to give you, swann.  all you have to do is...beg.
fuck you.
you don't think i've got it to give?
no!
don't touch me.  he's got... got into my head.
you want to be like that, swann? mud and shit?
swann?  what are you doing?
binding you.
how'd you spell that again?
d.a.m.o.u.r.  d'amour.  harry d'amour.
d'amour.
right.
isn't that french for something?
mister d'amour?
yeah.  it's french.
right.
that's so cool.
yeah?
you haven't paid the cab.  he won't give us your bags 'til you pay him.
how much?
thirty-five bucks.
tell him he can keep them. the bellboy looks puzzled.
hello, l.a.
have a nice evening, mr. d'amour.
you bet.
ever watched a man die?  if you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. and if you're very quick, you can catch it.
please... butterfield... i wasn't there.  ask pimm.
pimm's dead.  jennifer desiderio's disappeared.  they knew the puritan was coming home.
so do you.  you've seen the future. haven't you?
yes.
and are you afraid?
yes.
you need an ambulance.
too late.  why are you here? did you cone... up here for a reading?
my god.
what?
you've taken some strange journeys in your life.
yeah.  you could say that.
you're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  and it's drawn to you.  you don't like that.
not much.
you can't change it.  you have to walk...  ...walk the line between heaven and hell.  it's your destiny.  accept it.
hold on.
i'm not afraid to die.  there's something terrible... coming home...
the puritan?
yes...
who is he?
what were you doing up there?
i'm a private detective.  i was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  a guy called tapert. insurance fraud.
tapert.  so, now i've got tapert, butterfield.
tapert's got nothing to do with this.  he came here to get his palm read.
what makes you so sure?
i got a file on him two inches thick.  he's a petty fraudster. this is something else.  ever heard of someone called the puritan?
new one on me.  okay.  let's see him.
where the fuck is he?
he got up and walked.
after that fall?. he must have broken half his bones.
d'amour... d'amour... why do i know that name?
i know him.  i saw him.
i saw him on t.v.  some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
he's a priest?
no.  he's just a guy who's got a nose for this shit.  like you.
i don't want him getting in the way.
he won't.
we've all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
what do you mean, "all of us?"
you didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  a lot of people believed in nix. they haven't forgotten his promise.
about?
death.
what about death?
it's an illusion.
bad show last night?
the usual.  full house. standing ovation.  i tell them it's magic...
... they believe you.
yeah.  remember quaid?
sure.
somebody killed him.
oh god.
i just saw him.
i'm putting in a new illusion tonight.  will you be there?
sure.  you want me to find out about quaid?  i mean, the funeral?
no.  i'm not going near him.
valentin?
good.  there.  yes?
you saw this?
shit.
mr. d'amour?
go away.
it's one in the afternoon.
what are you, my mother?
i need to speak to you, mr. d'amour.  about last night.
whatever i said, i didn't mean it, okay?  i get a few drinks inside me --
we've never met.
then what do you want?
i'm here to offer you a job.
i'm going back to new york in--  shit!  i'm outta here.
have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
whose is the car?
mine.
nah.  you're driving it too carefully.
maybe i just bought it.
somebody's been smoking in here for months.
havanas.  you're not the smoker.  so who is?
you could almost pass for a detective, d'amour.  i work for the best illusionist in the world.
philip swann?
you know of him?
i saw him in vegas once.
are you a gambling man?
when i can afford to lose. swann's quite a magician.
never call him that.  he's strictly an illusionist.
what's the difference?
illusions are trickery. magicians do it for real.
any movie stars buried here?
probably.
it's not a bad place.  warm. great view.
i don't think the dead much care.
are you sure?
are you a believer, then?
who is she?
swann's wife.
i want you to help me help my husband.  i know he's in some kind of trouble.  and it's something to do with the man you saw murdered.
did your husband know quaid?
yes.  they weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  i think philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
you don't?
i think we make our own futures.
what's the connection?
i don't exactly know. philip doesn't like to talk about the past.
why not?
he's a secretive man.
and you don't ask questions?
we don't share our lives the way a lot of people do.
does that mean...?
we haven't slept in the same bed for years.
but obviously you still care what happens to him.
we wouldn't be having this conversation if i didn't. swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
you don't believe me.
he's an illusionist.  it's not exactly brain surgery.
sorry.  you asked.
no.  you're right.  he could have been something more. maybe a lot more.  but people get lost.  even good people. too much fame.  too much money,
where do i sign?
will you take the job, mr. d'amour?
harry.
harry.
i'm no bodyguard.
that's not what i'm asking for. i want somebody who can find out what philip saw in those damn cards. and stop it from happening.
when do you want me to start?
come to the show with me. tonight i want you to see him with an audience.  they love him.
do you?
i didn't marry him for love, mr. d'amour.  tonight?
sure.
the case is closed. harry. tapert's given us a full confession.  get your ass back to mew york.
no.  i'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
you never took a fucking vacation in your life, harry. what's going on?
i got to go.  i'm late.
call me tomorrow.
there's other guys as good as me, loomis.
yeah.  but not as cheap.  call me.
a couple of weeks.
one question.
what?
who is she?
he's good.
you haven't seen anything yet.
you did.  didn't you?
why would i do that?
beats me.
you don't have a clue what you're into, do you?
deep shit?
who did this?
i told you --
who did this?
all right.  it was...
and this butterfield guy--
--vanished.
another fucking magician. jesus.
are you finished with me?
for now.  are you planning to go back to new york?
no.  not yet...
are they treating you okay?
i heard what happened.  it looks like somebody murdered him.
i'm sorry i got into this too late. but if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
i don't know where you'd start.
well... how about some of the other illusionists?
they won't tell you anything.
i can be very persuasive.
yes.  i think you probably can.  we'd need to talk about your fee.
forget the fee.  if i find butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money.  if i don't...  ...my gamble.  either way... i get to spend some time... here.
where'd you learn that?
what?
that.
at birth.  i don't know you --
harry d'amour.
i know all the kids coming up. got to stay ahead of the game. but i don't know you.
i'm in from new york.  i came to see swann.
what a tragedy.  it was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
was he taking a lot of risks?
you don't know the half of it. i'm walter wilder, by the way.
not the walter wilder?
you know vinovich?
sure.  vivovich.
he knew swann way back.  he says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
i'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
people are pretty cagey.  who do you know?
for what?
for an introduction.
well... nobody.
i only wear ties for funerals.
you don't get in without one. it's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  except most of us aren't gentlemen.
are they all in the business?
it's not a business. harry. it's a vocation.
that's what they call the repository.  every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
have you been in?
no.  there's only three keys. vinovich has got one, of course.  he's a little crazy, by the way. and he's a mean drunk. otherwise, he's a real charmer.
you believe that?
i think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
heaven and hell?
trickery and divinity.
are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
no.  i'm saying they were always fake.  the saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
so could you walk on water?
i could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
what about swann's miracles?
they weren't worth a damn.
i heard he was the best.
if he was so good why's he so dead?
you tell me.  no?  i thought you'd maybe have a theory.
oh, i've got plenty.
i'd like to hear them.
i'm not saying another word.  you damn fool.  he's a journalist.
just tell me about swann.  or are you too scared?
he was a freak.  everything he did was tainted.
with what?
evil.  he was evil.  come on.
great accent, by the way.  is it brooklyn?
fuck you.
i gotta be careful.  if vinovich sees me talking to you.  he's an asshole, but he's a powerful asshole.
they go together.
i've heard a name.  someone they talk about in whispers.
who?
nix.
nix?
like in nothing.  nobody.  nix.
who is he?
i think maybe he taught swann.  this is me.  see ya around.
please... i wasn't there... ask pimm.
pimm's dead.  jennifer desiderio's disappeared...
how did it go today?
i went up to the magic castle. you were right.  he didn't have a lot of fans up there.
they were jealous of him.
why?  because he had you?
he... didn't have me..  i told you-
you didn't marry him for love.
so why did you marry him?
that's my business. harry.
just curious.  back to business.  ever heard of a man called nix?  dorothea?
yes... i'm here.  and no.  i don't know the name.
what about jennifer desiderio?
it doesn't ring a bell.  i have to go.
okay.  i'll keep digging.
yes.  you do that.
what the fuck are you doing here?
looking for you.  i tried the hotel.
why'd you come here?
you're a detective, with no clues. where else are you going to look? i'm going to keep this brief.  here's thirty thousand dollars.
what for?
a ticket home,
you didn't hire me.  she did. if she wants me off the job, i want to hear it from her.
she doesn't want to see you. she's had enough pain.  enough churning over the past.  she wants it all left alone.
left alone?  somebody's been murdered.
yes.  it's regrettable
fuck regrettable!  i want to know why.
what for?  you need to stay busy?
i like to know why things happen.
why people die?  give it up, d'amour.  go home.
no.
jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
a mister quaid?
right.  and he's dead, isn't he?  i saw it on the news. jennifer doesn't know.  and frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told.
i won't say anything.
jennifer's been with us four years. she was coming on nicely. but just the last month or so, she's worse than ever.
what's her problem?
she has no real grip on reality.
does anybody?
oh yes.  we have to agree what's real and what's not. that's what holds us together.
and what does jennifer think's real?
have we met before?
no.
only i forget.  they give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... i forget things,
well, you didn't forget me.  i just came because i wanted to know if you knew a man called butterfield.
maybe... i... don't...
what about philip swann?
i knew swann.  he's a fucking liar.
why's that?
he said he knew how to protect us. but he didn't know anything.  he made us think it was over and done with.
what is?
i don't want to think about it. if i think about it he'll hear me. he'll find me.
swann?
he's not!  he's not!
who's not?
nix! nix!
is he the puritan?
yes! yes!
and he's dead?
no.  he's coming back.  he's digging his way out!
i want to speak to dorothea.
i'm afraid she's not in.
when will she be in?
crank call.  i'll get the number changed.
no word from d'amour?
it's better he's gone.  he would have done more harm than good.
harm to whom?  me?  i don't think, so.  try him again at the hotel.
i left three messages already.
i'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
how?
it'll be something hokey.
i hear mrs. swann's quite a babe.
you heard right.
you ever been married?
yeah.  she was killed in a car crash.  her lawyer was driving. she was filing for divorce.
why?
my life was too weird for her.
i love weird.
billy?  this was on miller's forehead.  any idea what it is?
nope.
i could have lost my fucking hands.
that would have kept you out of the magic circle.  which was presumably the idea.  these are about nix.
that's butterfield...
doorway) and who's that?
take a look at this.
a nix specialty?
maybe they're not tricks.
i mean, there's no instructions--  what do you mean, they're not tricks?
what did vinovich say? something about walking a path between --
trickery and divinity.  yeah, he says that all the time.
that's because he knew.  he'd seen these files and knew.
knew what?
hokey enough for you?
i'm out of here, man!  are you coming?
thanks, billy.
hey, anytime.  actually, no.  this was enough.
i can't let you in.
yeah, i know.
you want more money, is that it?
leave her alone --
shut up!
flesh is a trap.  that's what he used to say.  flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  why did you come back?
i didn't leave.  i was just digging around.
what did you find?
jennifer desiderio, for one.  she threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
oh christ.
why don't you tell me the truth?
nix ran some kind of cult, right? some kind of charlie manson deal?
it was more than that, i think.
he was the real thing, right?
swann said he could do stuff, yes.
stuff?
he could get into people's heads. make them see things. terrible things.  and he could levitate. juggle fire.
he taught all this to swann?
some or it.
so swann was performing magic. not illusions?  and what?  you thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
i told you --
too much fame.  yeah, i guess that'd turn anybody's head. including yours.
no.
you said you weren't with him for love.
i wasn't.
what then?
i was grateful to him.  i owed him my life.  and he loved me. he couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
he thought nix was coming back, didn't he?
it's okay.
no it isn't.  you can't help me.
i'm here, aren't i?
nothing's going to happen to you.
nothing?
nothing you don't want.
i was so afraid.
don't be.  nix can't hurt you now.
are you sure?
i'm sure.  he's dead.
i know.  i'm the one who shot him.
i was twelve.  nix took me hostage, to get swann to come to him.
and they all came...
yes.
quaid and jennifer--
and pimm and swann.  only nix was ready for them.
what was that?
it's okay.
are you all right?
find valentin!  find him!  get him in here!
are you satisfied now?
no.
harry?
it's all right.  it's not hurting...
you rigged the illusion to fail, right?
yes.
you paid off the doctor.  you set up the fake body.  yes?
yes.
and then... because i was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called swann
i tried to pay you off.
was that swann's idea?
no.  it was mine.  i didn't want any more bloodshed. that's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for nix to come after.
nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
i want to see swann face to face.
why don't you leave this alone? let everybody think it's over?
what about me?
nix was never interested in you. it was always swann.
please.
i could scoop them out.
don't.
so tell me where nix is buried.
i don't know.
i'll tell you.
you'll do more.than that.
a lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you're still alive.
they'll never find out.
look, ma, no wires.
you shouldn't have followed me, d'amour.
how the fuck do you do that?
now i'm going to have to kill you.
i don't think so.  you need me alive.
why?  so you can fuck my wife?
you know, it's such a fucking waste.  you can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick.
illusionists get. las vegas contracts, d'amour.  magicians get burned.
or murdered, like nix.
he deserved it.
maybe he doesn't see it that way. maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  that's what you're hiding away from, isn't it?
i did it for dorothea.
oh yeah?
now that i'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
so nix won't come looking for her?
it's me betrayed him.
and she shot him i  i think that'd piss me off if i were nix.
i don't know what else to do.
help me.
oh jeez.
will that do?  no?
jesus.  valentin.  what did you do to your face?
it was me.
you think i'm an asshole.
didn't know you read minds.
i can do a lot of shit, d'amour. but you know that.  so i like playing games with people.  gives them something to wonder about...
is that all?
i distract them from their banality for a few minutes. it's like a public service.  it doesn't mean much in the end. they're all going to die.
and you're not?
oh, i was going to discover the secret of the universe.  that's why i liked nix.  he promised me all these explanations.
and he didn't have them?
he had something.  he showed me how to bend the rules.  a little levitation.  a few fireworks.
is that all?
no.  at the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. he showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  jelly. shit...
and you believed him?
i saw it with my own fucking eyes! see, that's his best trick.  no illusions.  just the truth.  are you ready for that?
did she know where nix was buried?
no.
who else did?  did valentin?
yes.
jesus!
like the look of these?  i made them myself, to set him free.
why did you wait so long?
i didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  i had to teach myself.  and that took time.
and you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
if he was just a man like me, then no.  but he's not.
what is he?
maybe he'll show you.
anything?
not yet.
if you've lied to me to me --
i swear... this is the place swann told me about.  the rocks...
oh christ!  oh christ!
it's him... it's him.
they got here before us.
looks that way.
d'amour --
shit...
help me.
him too.
we've got to get you to a hospital.
don't bother.
shut up.  we've lost enough lives already.
i'm sorry, d'amour...
what about?
... looks like you're going... to lose... one more.
... no...
he's better off this way.
nobody's better off this wav!
you don't get it, do you? we're shit. d'amour.
that's where we're all going.
in my time, and nobody else's.
do you wish him to be amongst us?
yes...
will you come to him on your knees?
yes...
be ready.
he's with us...
he's with us... he's with us...
jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
at a guess... they just resurrected him.
fuck.
this is where we killed him.
you didn't try hard enough.
i can't... i can't go any further...
oh god!
hang on!
and?
i should have been honest with you, right from the start.  i wasn't born to show people the error of their ways.  i was born to murder the world.
you could still help me do that.
why would i want to?
because you've got nothing else to live for.
not true.
the woman has a new love in her life.  your friends are dead. nobody's left to save you, but me
i've got to help him.
you can't.
nix has got to have a weak spot. everybody's got a fucking weak spot.
you know i'll kill you when we're done.  i have to.
yes.
but until then... it's you and me... the way it always was.
yes.
wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
no!
liar!
no!  no!  no!
harry...
... oh... god...
i'm here, harry.
...yes?
yes.
don't look.
i... have... to.
harry?
i'm okay.  i'm okay.
he did something with the ground.
yes?
can you do it?
i don't know.
try.
is it finished?
i think so.
what the fuck?
harry-?
out!  out!
