I have got so much power to give you, swann.  all you have to do is...beg.
fuck you.
you do not think I have got it to give?
no!
do not touch me.  he is got... got into my head.
you want to be like that, swann? mud and shit?
swann?  what are you doing?
binding you.
how did you spell that again?
d.a.m.o.u.r.  d'amour.  harry d'amour.
d'amour.
right.
is not that french for something?
mister d'amour?
yeah.  it is french.
right.
that is so cool.
yeah?
you have not paid the cab.  he will not give us your bags 'til you pay him.
how much?
thirty-five bucks.
tell him he can keep them. the bellboy looks puzzled.
hello, l.a.
have a nice evening, mr. d'amour.
you bet.
ever watched a man die?  if you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. and if you are very quick, you can catch it.
please... butterfield... i was not there.  ask pimm.
pimm's dead.  jennifer desiderio's disappeared.  they knew the puritan was coming home.
so do you.  you have seen the future. have not you?
yes.
and are you afraid?
yes.
you need an ambulance.
too late.  why are you here? did you cone... up here for a reading?
my god.
what?
you have taken some strange journeys in your life.
yeah.  you could say that.
you are drawn to the dark side, over and over.  and it is drawn to you.  you do not like that.
not much.
you can not change it.  you have to walk...  ...walk the line between heaven and hell.  it is your destiny.  accept it.
hold on.
I am not afraid to die.  there is something terrible... coming home...
the puritan?
yes...
who is he?
what were you doing up there?
I am a private detective.  i was hired to follow somebody for a few days.  a guy called tapert. insurance fraud.
tapert.  so, now I have got tapert, butterfield.
tapert's got nothing to do with this.  he came here to get his palm read.
what makes you so sure?
i got a file on him two inches thick.  he is a petty fraudster. this is something else.  ever heard of someone called the puritan?
new one on me.  okay.  let's see him.
where the fuck is he?
he got up and walked.
after that fall?. he must have broken half his bones.
d'amour... d'amour... why do i know that name?
i know him.  i saw him.
i saw him on t.v.  some kid got possessed and he saved the little bastard's life.
he is a priest?
no.  he is just a guy who is got a nose for this shit.  like you.
i do not want him getting in the way.
he won't.
we have all of us waited too long to have the homecoming spoiled.
what do you mean, "all of us?"
you did not think it was just going to be you and me?  a lot of people believed in nix. they have not forgotten his promise.
about?
death.
what about death?
it is an illusion.
bad show last night?
the usual.  full house. standing ovation.  i tell them it is magic...
... they believe you.
yeah.  remember quaid?
sure.
somebody killed him.
oh god.
i just saw him.
I am putting in a new illusion tonight.  will you be there?
sure.  you want me to find out about quaid?  i mean, the funeral?
no.  I am not going near him.
valentin?
good.  there.  yes?
you saw this?
shit.
mr. d'amour?
go away.
it is one in the afternoon.
what are you, my mother?
i need to speak to you, mr. d'amour.  about last night.
whatever i said, i did not mean it, okay?  i get a few drinks inside me --
we have never met.
then what do you want?
I am here to offer you a job.
I am going back to new york in--  shit!  I am outta here.
have you got a job that will pay you five thousand a day?
whose is the car?
mine.
nah.  you are driving it too carefully.
maybe i just bought it.
somebody is been smoking in here for months.
havanas.  you are not the smoker.  so who is?
you could almost pass for a detective, d'amour.  i work for the best illusionist in the world.
philip swann?
you know of him?
i saw him in vegas once.
are you a gambling man?
when i can afford to lose. swann's quite a magician.
never call him that.  he is strictly an illusionist.
what is the difference?
illusions are trickery. magicians do it for real.
any movie stars buried here?
probably.
it is not a bad place.  warm. great view.
i do not think the dead much care.
are you sure?
are you a believer, then?
who is she?
swann's wife.
i want you to help me help my husband.  i know he is in some kind of trouble.  and it is something to do with the man you saw murdered.
did your husband know quaid?
yes.  they were not close, but they saw each other once in a while.  i think philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards.
you don't?
i think we make our own futures.
what is the connection?
i do not exactly know. philip does not like to talk about the past.
why not?
he is a secretive man.
and you do not ask questions?
we do not share our lives the way a lot of people do.
does that mean...?
we have not slept in the same bed for years.
but obviously you still care what happens to him.
we would not be having this conversation if i didn't. swann's one of the most remarkable men alive.
you do not believe me.
he is an illusionist.  it is not exactly brain surgery.
sorry.  you asked.
no.  you are right.  he could have been something more. maybe a lot more.  but people get lost.  even good people. too much fame.  too much money,
where do i sign?
will you take the job, mr. d'amour?
harry.
harry.
I am no bodyguard.
that is not what I am asking for. i want somebody who can find out what philip saw in those damn cards. and stop it from happening.
when do you want me to start?
come to the show with me. tonight i want you to see him with an audience.  they love him.
do you?
i did not marry him for love, mr. d'amour.  tonight?
sure.
the case is closed. harry. tapert's given us a full confession.  get your ass back to mew york.
no.  I am taking a couple of weeks' vacation.
you never took a fucking vacation in your life, harry. what is going on?
i got to go.  I am late.
call me tomorrow.
there is other guys as good as me, loomis.
yeah.  but not as cheap.  call me.
a couple of weeks.
one question.
what?
who is she?
he is good.
you have not seen anything yet.
you did.  did not you?
why would i do that?
beats me.
you do not have a clue what you are into, do you?
deep shit?
who did this?
i told you --
who did this?
all right.  it was...
and this butterfield guy--
--vanished.
another fucking magician. jesus.
are you finished with me?
for now.  are you planning to go back to new york?
no.  not yet...
are they treating you okay?
i heard what happened.  it looks like somebody murdered him.
I am sorry i got into this too late. but if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops do not look...
i do not know where you would start.
well... how about some of the other illusionists?
they will not tell you anything.
i can be very persuasive.
yes.  i think you probably can.  we would need to talk about your fee.
forget the fee.  if i find butterfield, maybe we will talk about money.  if i don't...  ...my gamble.  either way... i get to spend some time... here.
where did you learn that?
what?
that.
at birth.  i do not know you --
harry d'amour.
i know all the kids coming up. got to stay ahead of the game. but i do not know you.
I am in from new york.  i came to see swann.
what a tragedy.  it was just a matter of time, of course, but it is not good for the business.
was he taking a lot of risks?
you do not know the half of it. I am walter wilder, by the way.
not the walter wilder?
you know vinovich?
sure.  vivovich.
he knew swann way back.  he says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit.
I would love to... you know... hang with some of you guys.
people are pretty cagey.  who do you know?
for what?
for an introduction.
well... nobody.
i only wear ties for funerals.
you do not get in without one. it is like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  except most of us are not gentlemen.
are they all in the business?
it is not a business. harry. it is a vocation.
that is what they call the repository.  every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room.
have you been in?
no.  there is only three keys. vinovich has got one, of course.  he is a little crazy, by the way. and he is a mean drunk. otherwise, he is a real charmer.
you believe that?
i think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
heaven and hell?
trickery and divinity.
are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
no.  I am saying they were always fake.  the saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
so could you walk on water?
i could reproduce any miracle that is ever been performed, with a little preparation.
what about swann's miracles?
they were not worth a damn.
i heard he was the best.
if he was so good why is he so dead?
you tell me.  no?  i thought you would maybe have a theory.
oh, I have got plenty.
I would like to hear them.
I am not saying another word.  you damn fool.  he is a journalist.
just tell me about swann.  or are you too scared?
he was a freak.  everything he did was tainted.
with what?
evil.  he was evil.  come on.
great accent, by the way.  is it brooklyn?
fuck you.
i got to be careful.  if vinovich sees me talking to you.  he is an asshole, but he is a powerful asshole.
they go together.
I have heard a name.  someone they talk about in whispers.
who?
nix.
nix?
like in nothing.  nobody.  nix.
who is he?
i think maybe he taught swann.  this is me.  see ya around.
please... i was not there... ask pimm.
pimm's dead.  jennifer desiderio's disappeared...
how did it go today?
i went up to the magic castle. you were right.  he did not have a lot of fans up there.
they were jealous of him.
why?  because he had you?
he... did not have me..  i told you-
you did not marry him for love.
so why did you marry him?
that is my business. harry.
just curious.  back to business.  ever heard of a man called nix?  dorothea?
yes... I am here.  and no.  i do not know the name.
what about jennifer desiderio?
it does not ring a bell.  i have to go.
okay.  I will keep digging.
yes.  you do that.
what the fuck are you doing here?
looking for you.  i tried the hotel.
why did you come here?
you are a detective, with no clues. where else are you going to look? I am going to keep this brief.  here's thirty thousand dollars.
what for?
a ticket home,
you did not hire me.  she did. if she wants me off the job, i want to hear it from her.
she does not want to see you. she is had enough pain.  enough churning over the past.  she wants it all left alone.
left alone?  somebody is been murdered.
yes.  it is regrettable
fuck regrettable!  i want to know why.
what for?  you need to stay busy?
i like to know why things happen.
why people die?  give it up, d'amour.  go home.
no.
jennifer's only ever had one visitor.
a mister quaid?
right.  and he is dead, is not he?  i saw it on the news. jennifer does not know.  and frankly, this is not the best tine for her to be told.
i will not say anything.
jennifer's been with us four years. she was coming on nicely. but just the last month or so, she is worse than ever.
what is her problem?
she has no real grip on reality.
does anybody?
oh yes.  we have to agree what is real and what is not. that is what holds us together.
and what does jennifer think's real?
have we met before?
no.
only i forget.  they give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... i forget things,
well, you did not forget me.  i just came because i wanted to know if you knew a man called butterfield.
maybe... i... don't...
what about philip swann?
i knew swann.  he is a fucking liar.
why is that?
he said he knew how to protect us. but he did not know anything.  he made us think it was over and done with.
what is?
i do not want to think about it. if i think about it he will hear me. he will find me.
swann?
he is not!  he is not!
who is not?
nix! nix!
is he the puritan?
yes! yes!
and he is dead?
no.  he is coming back.  he is digging his way out!
i want to speak to dorothea.
I am afraid she is not in.
when will she be in?
crank call.  I will get the number changed.
no word from d'amour?
it is better he is gone.  he would have done more harm than good.
harm to whom?  me?  i do not think, so.  try him again at the hotel.
i left three messages already.
I am sure they will have this place rigged.
how?
it will be something hokey.
i hear mrs. swann's quite a babe.
you heard right.
you ever been married?
yeah.  she was killed in a car crash.  her lawyer was driving. she was filing for divorce.
why?
my life was too weird for her.
i love weird.
billy?  this was on miller's forehead.  any idea what it is?
nope.
i could have lost my fucking hands.
that would have kept you out of the magic circle.  which was presumably the idea.  these are about nix.
that is butterfield...
doorway) and who is that?
take a look at this.
a nix specialty?
maybe they are not tricks.
i mean, there is no instructions--  what do you mean, they are not tricks?
what did vinovich say? something about walking a path between --
trickery and divinity.  yeah, he says that all the time.
that is because he knew.  he would seen these files and knew.
knew what?
hokey enough for you?
I am out of here, man!  are you coming?
thanks, billy.
hey, anytime.  actually, no.  this was enough.
i can not let you in.
yeah, i know.
you want more money, is that it?
leave her alone --
shut up!
flesh is a trap.  that is what he used to say.  flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  why did you come back?
i did not leave.  i was just digging around.
what did you find?
jennifer desiderio, for one.  she threw herself in front of a car this afternoon.
oh christ.
why do not you tell me the truth?
nix ran some kind of cult, right? some kind of charlie manson deal?
it was more than that, i think.
he was the real thing, right?
swann said he could do stuff, yes.
stuff?
he could get into people's heads. make them see things. terrible things.  and he could levitate. juggle fire.
he taught all this to swann?
some or it.
so swann was performing magic. not illusions?  and what?  you thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions.
i told you --
too much fame.  yeah, i guess that would turn anybody's head. including yours.
no.
you said you were not with him for love.
i wasn't.
what then?
i was grateful to him.  i owed him my life.  and he loved me. he could not always show it, but he felt it.
he thought nix was coming back, did not he?
it is okay.
no it isn't.  you can not help me.
I am here, are not i?
nothing's going to happen to you.
nothing?
nothing you do not want.
i was so afraid.
do not be.  nix can not hurt you now.
are you sure?
I am sure.  he is dead.
i know.  I am the one who shot him.
i was twelve.  nix took me hostage, to get swann to come to him.
and they all came...
yes.
quaid and jennifer--
and pimm and swann.  only nix was ready for them.
what was that?
it is okay.
are you all right?
find valentin!  find him!  get him in here!
are you satisfied now?
no.
harry?
it is all right.  it is not hurting...
you rigged the illusion to fail, right?
yes.
you paid off the doctor.  you set up the fake body.  yes?
yes.
and then... because i was getting too close to something --  --or someone, you called swann
i tried to pay you off.
was that swann's idea?
no.  it was mine.  i did not want any more bloodshed. that is why we went to all this trouble, so there would be no one for nix to come after.
nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
have not you seen enough to know that does not matter?
i want to see swann face to face.
why do not you leave this alone? let everybody think it is over?
what about me?
nix was never interested in you. it was always swann.
please.
i could scoop them out.
don't.
so tell me where nix is buried.
i do not know.
I will tell you.
you will do more.than that.
a lot of people are going to be really pissed off when they discover you are still alive.
they will never find out.
look, ma, no wires.
you should not have followed me, d'amour.
how the fuck do you do that?
now I am going to have to kill you.
i do not think so.  you need me alive.
why?  so you can fuck my wife?
you know, it is such a fucking waste.  you can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it is some trick.
illusionists get. las vegas contracts, d'amour.  magicians get burned.
or murdered, like nix.
he deserved it.
maybe he does not see it that way. maybe he is digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  that is what you are hiding away from, is not it?
i did it for dorothea.
oh yeah?
now that I am dead, the spotlight's off her.
so nix will not come looking for her?
it is me betrayed him.
and she shot him i  i think that would piss me off if i were nix.
i do not know what else to do.
help me.
oh jeez.
will that do?  no?
jesus.  valentin.  what did you do to your face?
it was me.
you think I am an asshole.
did not know you read minds.
i can do a lot of shit, d'amour. but you know that.  so i like playing games with people.  gives them something to wonder about...
is that all?
i distract them from their banality for a few minutes. it is like a public service.  it does not mean much in the end. they are all going to die.
and you are not?
oh, i was going to discover the secret of the universe.  that is why i liked nix.  he promised me all these explanations.
and he did not have them?
he had something.  he showed me how to bend the rules.  a little levitation.  a few fireworks.
is that all?
no.  at the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. he showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  jelly. shit...
and you believed him?
i saw it with my own fucking eyes! see, that is his best trick.  no illusions.  just the truth.  are you ready for that?
did she know where nix was buried?
no.
who else did?  did valentin?
yes.
jesus!
like the look of these?  i made them myself, to set him free.
why did you wait so long?
i did not have the skill to resurrect him.  i had to teach myself.  and that took time.
and you think he will be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
if he was just a man like me, then no.  but he is not.
what is he?
maybe he will show you.
anything?
not yet.
if you have lied to me to me --
i swear... this is the place swann told me about.  the rocks...
oh christ!  oh christ!
it is him... it is him.
they got here before us.
looks that way.
d'amour --
shit...
help me.
him too.
we have got to get you to a hospital.
do not bother.
shut up.  we have lost enough lives already.
I am sorry, d'amour...
what about?
... looks like you are going... to lose... one more.
... no...
he is better off this way.
nobody's better off this wav!
you do not get it, do you? we are shit. d'amour.
that is where we are all going.
in my time, and nobody else's.
do you wish him to be amongst us?
yes...
will you come to him on your knees?
yes...
be ready.
he is with us...
he is with us... he is with us...
jesus... what the hell's going on in there?
at a guess... they just resurrected him.
fuck.
this is where we killed him.
you did not try hard enough.
i can't... i can not go any further...
oh god!
hang on!
and?
i should have been honest with you, right from the start.  i was not born to show people the error of their ways.  i was born to murder the world.
you could still help me do that.
why would i want to?
because you have got nothing else to live for.
not true.
the woman has a new love in her life.  your friends are dead. nobody's left to save you, but me
I have got to help him.
you can't.
nix has got to have a weak spot. everybody's got a fucking weak spot.
you know I will kill you when we are done.  i have to.
yes.
but until then... it is you and me... the way it always was.
yes.
wait... you still feel something for that bitch?
no!
liar!
no!  no!  no!
harry...
... oh... god...
I am here, harry.
...yes?
yes.
do not look.
i... have... to.
harry?
I am okay.  I am okay.
he did something with the ground.
yes?
can you do it?
i do not know.
try.
is it finished?
i think so.
what the fuck?
harry-?
out!  out!
