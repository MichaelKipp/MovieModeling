where to?
are you sure you got my bag in?
what do you think?  i left it on the curb?
I am sorry, I am a little nervous.  it is my first time in new york.  just a minute.
i came to new york to visit my youngest daughter.
and where is she?
she would have come to the airport to meet me - she wanted to - but ... but, she just started a new job and, well, i guess no one drives here.
so, you come here all by yourself?
uh, yes.  my husband passed away recently ...
... oh ...
... and the children thought i should take a trip.
yeah.
I am from south dakota.  where are you from?
moscow.
ohhh.  do you know the east village?
oh, yeah ... yeah ... it is a hellhole.
you mean it is dangerous?
nah, not dangerous.  not that dangerous.  not during the day.
this is one-way street.  you go down the block to the middle.
this way?
yeah.  not far.  you will be fine.  it is still day.
i see.  how much?
forty-five all total.
forty-five?  i thought it was only supposed to be thirty?
thirty is base price.  tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.
so, what do you think?
well, once you are inside, it is nice.
you do not like where i live?
well, when i walked up the block, i ... well, my word!
that is new york.  it looks rundown, but it is safe during the day.  you will get used to it.
i wanted to ask you something.  those motorcycles across the street ...?
uh-huh?
... what are they all doing there?
that is the satan's disciples' new york headquarters.
the motorcycle gang?  do not they deal drugs and rape young girls?
I have never had any problem with them. people say it is the safest block in the east village.  i just hope their motorcycles do not keep you up at night.
i just can not seem to focus on anything these days.
that is why it is good you came to visit me.
how are you doing sweetheart?
I am good.
dating anyone?
no, I am working too much, i do not have time.
what about the fellow in those pictures?
what pictures?
you know ...  ... whoops!
mother!
well, they were right out in plain view.
behind the books.
but i was dusting.
i was seeing aaron and there were some ... complications.
he seemed quite taken with you.
i do not want to talk about it.
you know, you never tell me anything.
that is not true.  besides, i do not want you dusting.  i want you to see new york.
oh, please, do not hurt me.
i just need to use the phone, lady.
oh, let me get out of your way then.
what happened?  did you lose your keys?
have a nice day.
who is it?
it is marika.  is paula there?
she is at work.  I am her mother.
oh.  i thought today was saturday.
I am sorry.  i had a wretched night.
oh.  you need a cappuccino.
and there was this number on my phone bill that i did not recognize.  calls made at three and four in the morning.  so, i called the number ... and a woman answered.  and i ... i hung up.  so, then i followed him.  just like in the movies.  and i found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in brooklyn.  we had been going together for almost a year.
men ... they are all the same.  our pastor in sioux falls was caught with his wife's sister.
really?
oh, it was such a big scandal.
what happened?
poor man had to leave town.  and i hear that other women came forward.
you know, you ought to come out to south dakota some time and meet my son, steve. he is single.
what does he do?
he is an organic farmer.
oh.  well, that would be a ... change.  thank you, mrs. peterson.  you have a very reassuring voice.
i wonder what they do in there?  do not they frighten you?  they all look so ...
... manly?
excuse me, sir.  i just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.
yeah, sure, no problem, you are welcome.
my daughter lives across the street from you people and she tells me that you keep this area safe.  is that true?
we like to think so, yeah.
and you do not deal drugs?
who told you we deal drugs?
I am just concerned about my daughter.
you do not have to worry.  she is going to be fine.  we are law-abiding citizens just like you.
what about yesterday?  kicking that poor boy?
that poor boy's a crack dealer from alphabet city.  we do not allow his kind on this block.
is there something else i can do for you?
well, I would love to see inside your club.
you want to come inside?
well, if you are not holding a meeting or anything.
don, this is my mother.  mom, this is my boss, don palmer.
oh, it is so nice to meet you.
mother, i ...
my daughter lives right across the street from the satan's disciples' clubhouse, and i was so worried about her ... so, i went over and introduced myself. and they were the nicest people.
what is wrong?
mom ... i mean, it is amusing to imagine such a thing, but ... how many of those pills have you been taking?
oh, that has nothing to do with it.
no, no, it is my fault.  I have been pushing you too hard to do things on your own.
mom, i need to talk to you.
if it is about the bikers, dear, i do not want to talk about it.
no, i had a dream about daddy.  do you think I will ever meet anyone like him?
oh, i hope so, dear.
you know that guy in the pictures you saw?
aaron?
yeah ... turned out to be a real jerk.
I am sorry.
it is unusually quiet tonight, is not it?
mm hmm.
i think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer.
oh, i do not want to be in the way. you have got your career and everything.
you would not be in the way.  i like having you around.
dear, i was thinking.  why do not we go to paris next year?  I have never been.  your father, god bless him, was not much for traveling.
I would love to.
here you go.  i think you should talk to dr. byrne when you get back about how much valium he is prescribing.  okay?
at my age, I am going to take any pill that makes me feel better.
mother!
i can make my own decisions.
i love you, mom.  i have to run.  you remembered to call the limousine service, right?
mm hmm.
well, bye.  and have a safe trip ... and ... paris in the spring!
goodbye, sweetheart.
