why were you so late tonight
i was showing sonya something . . .
what were you showing her?
how to read.
i thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
i know, but i had to because . . .
oh, grandmama, why do you have to go back to paris?
it's where i've made my home but i do have something for you . . .
"together in paris"! oh, when can we be "together in paris?!
when you're older . . .
rasputin!  you're alive . . .
despite being shot, poisoned and thrown into an icy river . . . yes!
i had nothing to do with it!
you gave the orders!
i did no such thing!
after all i've done for your family - you tried to kill meeeeee ! ! !
hurry, grandmama!
get on! anastasia, get on!
are you running away?
no.  i'm running <u>to</u>.
where is your home, anya?
i'm not sure but look. . .
i have to go now, before it gets light.
but what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
then you'll have to make your own home. lots of people do.
anya! what if <u>we</u> can't find anyone who loves us?!
then come find me.
it's no use, dmitri - we'll never find the right girl!
we will.  we <u>have</u> to.  come on, vlad - she's out there.
ouch!  that really hurt!
i'm sorry. . .  i'm. . .
that's quite a hard head you've got there, boy.
who did you hear it from?
i heard it from everyone who said i didn't hear it from them!   do you know dmitri?
providing travel papers is illeagal!  i know dmitri well - perhaps i can help you.  providded you have enough money to pay for this service. . .
well, i don't have any money . . .
good day!
what was that?
that was your dinner!  i do hope there is no cabbage in paris!
and a song someone sings once upon a december.
who are you?!
it's her.
he's her?
look!
she doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .
ew. . .  the honest type.
people say anastasia was the only member of the royal family to escape alive.  that makes her an orphan too
what happened to your parents?
i don't know - i don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
you know, it's strange - anastasia's grandmother, the dowager empress tatiana has been looking for anastasia since the revolution.  why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
i don't know.  i don't see what this has to do with me.
perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
i was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .
look, i came here to get papers to travel to paris and. . .
why do you want to go to paris?
i have my reasons.
anastasia's grandmother is in paris.  we're going to bring anastasia to her - in paris.
you never thought of the possibility?
look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . .  look at me!
what?
oh my god!  don't do that ... feel my heart. go ahead. i'm dying here ...
and what do you want, my little rat-with-wings?
i gave you that tongue and i can rip it out!
no, i really like my tongue... we're very attached.  oyyyy... okay, now... promise you won't get angry.
why would i ever be angry with you, little friend?
so, i'm cruisin' the rafters and... what can i say, i struck out. i thought chicks would like the fact that i can talk, you know but, i mean, the way things are going i couldn't get invited to a plague.  someone's gotta clean that up...
get to the point sometime tonight.. i'm late for a wenching.
okay... you're not gonna like this but, well, it looks like anastasia is ... still alive.
trust me, it's her!
how do you know?
rodent's intuition, how do i know? she looks exactly like her. except she's taller, which	is natural ... of course my second cousin treplev - he never	grew. looks like a little pepper shaker. he was so cute ...
hey, she's just a kid. and she's going to paris outta sight, outta mind, outta russia.
i cursed then all!
my aunt bella, sweet woman not the brightest bat in the world - she used to hang right side up, anyway she always said "curses were made to be broken". course, she said it in those irritating little bat squeaks, so it wasn't quite so profound...
do you have any idea what would happen if that broke?!
you'd lose your security deposit?
evil, powerful beings - i have their power only if i contain them, control them. if they should all be released at once... well ...
hurry up with those papers.
would you have leaned over rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
wake up, young lady, that's our train.
"wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
what a world - a man who was in my position in society is calling a peasant 'your highness".
do you always punch people first thing in the morning?
sorry - it's a reflex. living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
i wasn't bothering you. i was trying to wake you up!
by pulling my hair?!
i was all out of dynamite!
you're a princess...
royalty do not help people with their luggage.
well, she certainly has a mind of her own.
yes. and i hate that in a woman.
what do we do now?
pray he's color-blind...
i'm going to stretch my legs
that's a good idea - a great idea - stretch your legs  ... stretch then that way.
come on up!
why?
just what do you think you're doing?!
trying... to... breathe...
forged papers! now, what?!
now just get off the train.
huh?!
noooo....
she's quite right, dmitri, a man of my stature should not have to
come on!
no!
you must enjoy causing me pain!
you shouldn't have pushed us!
is everyone all right?
i'm fine.
yesss... our power is much stronger when were near. we must get close to her.
oy... not a road trip. i get wagon sick, you know that.
we have to prepare you for an audience with sophie.
who's sophie?
ah ... the lady sophie... the ravishing first cousin, once removed, from the empress. we must convince sophie that you are the princess before we'll be granted a meeting with the empress ... your grandmother, i mean.
you never said anything to me about having to prove i'm a princess!
you are the princess.
we're just going to refresh your memory...
i don't have a memory and i'm not a princess!  even if i were - no one's ever going to believe it. i'm not exactly...
see? the princess is under there ...
ah! let us begin!
every russian family has one..
natasha! natasha feastavich!- but we called her nashie fooshie!
did i tell you that?
you must have.
...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .  [this section also not ledgable]
it's the best fork of all
the dessert fork!
what a beautiful ship!
it used to be a private yacht before the government took it over.
no! i look ridiculous!
come out! i can do alterations.
you'll laugh.
i shant!
not you. him.
you said you wouldn't laugh!
it's not you - it's the dress!
it's so beautiful ... and sad.
sad?
lost. it feels lost. this was hers?
yeah ... well, yours. you still don't believe that you're the princess, do you?
i know i must have had something to do with the palace - i've had little flashes of things - but being the princess? it doesn't matter as long as i find my home.
well, the only thing you've got when you've got a home is a fear of losing it! you're lucky you don't remember the revolution -- i never had much, but what i did have -- i lost.
i'm sorry.
hey! it doesn't matter! you gotta make your own way in the world! don't be sorry for me! i'm going to get what i want don't you worry!
i'm getting a chest cold..
bartok... a question.
i'm getting pneumonia. i have a fever. feel my forehead...
what do you think is the most humiliating way to die?
boy, don't you hate it when that happens?
she leads a charmed life, that little one ... someone is always there to save her. in the palace as a child, on the train and now ... it's him.
bartok ... have you ever been to paris?
me? no. rich food - it kills me. ever try and fly after one of those heavy sauces?
oh! i'm sorry...
it's okay. didn't hurt..
how is our current financial status?
if i used the word "bleak" i would be optimistic.
the "odessa dunk"?
it worked in odessa...
nervous?
yes - if i can't convince sophie, i'll never be able to see tatiana....
you'll convince her. you have the qualities of a princess you're poised and strong... and beautiful ... even if you forget a couple dates of family names - she'll know.
may i present her royal highness princess anastasia!
oh good! we haven't seen an anastasia in several days!
are you impressed with our anastasia?
oh, heavens - i must say, yes.
then, you'll take her to see tatiana?
oh, heavens i must say... no, no actually, i can't - tatiana has refused to see any more girls.
perhaps you could convince her?
oh, heavens, no... but ...  she is going to be at the ballet russe tonight! that's the russian ballet - russe for russian, oh those crazy french... they only go to see which dancers will defect.
we did it! we did it, my boy! we're going to see tatiana at the ballet tonight and we're going to be rich! rich!
but it's not	the money, vlad.
are you feeling all right?
life is funny, isn't it. you find the right girl ... and then you lose her.
what do you mean?
dmitri ... you must understand that once you take her to tatiana... well, it's over... nothing can happen between you. she's a princess and you're a commoner.
parse holds the key to my heart french- bat- chicks hang out at montmartre we'll eat some in-sects then go back and have --
shut up!
i'm so scared...
don't be
i need to speak with the dowager empress ...
how much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?!
please, if you'd just listen...
remove him at once.
anya, wait!
tell me it isn't true?! tell me you didn't do this for the money!
no! well, yes, but
no! i thought you believed in me! it was all a lie!
i'm not ulo and i won't slow down. but you will listen to me!
you! how dare you?! stop this car immediately!
anastasia's music box... she had this all these years...  you could have found it...
what i <u>found</u>your was your granddaughter!
who are you, child?
i don't know! i don't want to hurt you...
do you remember this?
i remember something lost ... i'm so confused! oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! do you think i could have... belonged to you ...
par away, long ago glowing deep as an ember
things my hear used to know things it years to remember
... and that christmas dinner, when cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! i do remember so much now, grandmama, - but not everything.
don't worry about that now, child, it will all come back to you now that you're home...
anastasia! it was just a bat! it's gone, dear...
no, it wasn't a bat! i saw this horrible man - i remember him, i think...
no, no child... shush... it's all right ...
i sent for you because i owe you a debt of gratitude larger than i can ever repay
no. empress, you --
i want you to have the reward money - you've earned it.
empress, no! i will not take the money! i just came to tell you i was sorry...
young	man, i...
you are the boy ...
i should go
that last night in the palace... one boy showed us kindness and courage. you were the boy who saved our lives, weren't you?  please, is there nothing i can do to repay you?
promise me she'll have her home.
she does.
and tell me that she's happy.
oh, dmitri.i wish that i could.
i'm glad you found what you were looking for.
i'm glad you	did too.
but this invitation came from the empress herself! it's the social event of the decade! you can't turn it down!
watch me.
so where will you go?
she found her home. maybe it's time i found one too!
so. you don't want to go to the coronation, eh?
rasputin!
i know, i know ... you thought i was dead. that's how the history books will remember me - not as the ruler of all of russia, which i should have been - but as the guy who was never dead when you expected him to be.
what do you want?!
the same thing i wanted ten years ago - all the romonovs dead i got the others, now i have to finish up with that nuisance, anastasia...
you're insane! you didn't kill the romonovs - it was the...
stop it! i did so kill them! and i'm going to kill anastasia.
don't you, child?
oh, yes, grandmama - i wait until i hear...
no, not about the ceremony, anastasia - do you understand the choice you must make.
oh, meetoo! you look miserable! oh, vlad - look at him!
yes, your highness.
poor meetoo!
yes, your highness.
cut it out, vlad! i'm not angry with you anymore - i know how much you needed the money.
dmitri didn't want the money?
no, he just wanted to know you were happy.
fortunately, i am to be married.  with your highness, permission.
vlad, stop acting this way! you're my friend!
no. from now on i am your loyal subject ... your highness. by your leave?
why does everyone have to act that way?
you'll have to become used to it, child, if you accept the crown...
"if" i accept?! of course i'm going to accept! it's what i always wanted!
is it? is this what you want?
i wanted to come home, grandmama - and i did. i came back to my home with you.
you can't go back to find your home. your home is in your heart, in the future that you make for yourself.
and this is my future. this is who i am!
this is who you were. exactly who you are is up to you.
i don't know who i am! i still don't know!
yes, you do. you do.
i've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
and we have found each other nothing will ever change that! i am your family, dear child, but i may not be your home.
dmitri?
anya... where are we?
i'll show you!
run, anya -  go...
don't let me go!
i'll never let go!
