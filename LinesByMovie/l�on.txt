ok, i'm fine.
good.
here, this is the light scoop for night shooting. there, you fix client's distance... how much to the bench down there in the park?
huh... 500 meters?
130... 140...
how can you say it?
look. when you can see his fingers, it's 50 meters.  when you just see his hands, it's about 80 meters. when you distinguish arms from body, it's 120-130. when you see nothing more than a shape, you don't shoot.  not very sure. you have one chance out of five to miss.  a contract means getting all chances on your side. 5 out of 5.  you can't miss a client. never... if the task is delicate or the risk is too big, you double. that is, you insure yourself by another means.
what, for example?
well, if the guy is far, in a car, and i know weather is going to be bad, rain for example, i think i would plastic the car, with a remote here. i shoot from the distance and if i miss i plastic.
what if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
rocket launcher.
oh really?  but can you miss the car?
wow! it's brilliant!
yeah...  come on, have a little training.
who'll i aim at?
whoever.
the fat man down there, on the bench.
perfect.
good! first shot!
yeah, but i didn't get him, i got his case and now he's behind the tree. what can i do?
it's not serious, it's just training. you have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
ok.
now, try a running guy.
the yellow and pink.
ok.
what's up? i don't feel you're concentrated.
yes, yes...
it's incredible! how did you do it?
what?
there, the guy... how did you do that, without even touching him? without noise. it's like you put him away... how did you do it?
...you moved too, didn't you?
yeah.
huh!? because of the slaughter at your same floor?
...not at all.
it's better...  you see, it's my turf, so i don't want contracts i'm not informed about, on my turf.  i'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
yes.
at a certain moment i thought: maybe leon would like working on his own? so he makes some little extras?
dirty work, and i kill no women and no kids.
that's what i later told myself!  no, tony, forget leon! it can't be him, he likes too much his job to make such a slaughter!
tell me... the money i earn and you keep for me...
do you need money?
no... just to know... because it's a long time i work... and i never did anything with my money... i should do something.
no, no.
pay attention to women, leon.  they are dangerous, you know?
yeah... well... i don't know.. i don't know any.
listen, think about what you want to do, but don't worry, your money is there and it's safer than in a bank... banks are robbed every five minutes!
why can't i have a bank account?
i'll explain you, leon: they'll ask you to fill in a lot of forms and you can't write and they'll ask you your job, your employer's name and you can't tell them: my job, i'm a hitman and my employer is tony, his record is longer than his resturant's menu.  that's why you can't have a bank account!
take...
well, i don't need them...
take them, you never know... if you want to have some fun. take, it's a gift.
five minutes. keep in front of the window.
ok.
come on, get down!
you were scared, weren't you?
i was nervous, that's all! where is the guy?
i killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... i left nothing for you!
it's strange, being in love... it's the first time for me...
how do you know it's love, if you've never been in love before?... it may be friendship... or the love you can have with a brother or a father... how can you know?
...because i feel it.
mathilda? may i come in?
yes.
why don't you take me with you?... i'm ready, now.  you said i learn very quickly.
quick doesn't mean "ready". and you can't discuss, we said. right?
may i go to the cinema?
no.
for musicals?  that's part of the job!
no, you can't go out.
you see, five minutes ago you said you loved me and now you hate me... but i prefer this!
i hate you because you depart without kissing me. that's all.
how are you, miss?
fine...
i'm sick with practicing, that's it...
i see. you're good, because i didn't hear anything.
yeah. i put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
huh? that's smart!
i'm used to it.  not everyone likes music.
yeah, true.  but what does your father exactly do for living?
...composer.
huh, that's good!
yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
huh?
...no... he's my lover...
what's that man's name?
why do you want to know?
he forgot his money...  my mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100$.
huh? i see, but this is the fbi, little girl, and i can't let you in.  but if you leave me his money, i'll give him it myself.
give me his name, i will mail him.
ok. mister stansfield, norman stansfield.
...office 2702.
yeah... how do you know it?
...i heard he said... that's all... thanks.
...you can leave whenever you want. i don't refrain you.
...this is what i don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time i can't get out!
not taken.
why?
too heavy.
well... then may you rent me your gear for the day?
i never rent my gear.
if you knew, leon...!  i killed one thousand in my head...  and this never disturbed my sleep.
ok... and if it's you who gets killed?  ...then?  talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? she's here! she moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. because it was your day, your hour, your second...
yes?
good morning, mister... it's danielle!
huh! you made an error, baby.  i don't know any danielle.
...i got lost, mister.
huh? move back, baby, i can't see anything.
it's not me, it's dark here... and i can't find the switch.
it's true... but a first contract, it's an exception.
and... may i kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
...i'm going to kiss you.
mathilda, stop, please!
stop. everyone is looking.
of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
...you don't believe me, don't you?
what?
when i say i love you.
mathilda, don't resume, please. ....change subject, ok?
...ok.  i love you anyway.
mathilda?!
ok, ok! excuse me! how old were you when you had your first contract?
...17.
...shit!!  we'd found him. we waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
what shall we do?
i think.
where are you going?
piddle. she smiles and looks for the bathroom. she finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. she withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. she doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join leon. in the living room, leon still thinks.
...why didn't he close the window?
it's cool departing this way... warm... music...
there are better things.  you see the importance of the "moment".  ten minutes early or late, he'd have seen death. he'd have suffered it.  this way, he already departed. without knowing.
...i'd like knowing what he's listening to...
...later.
...yes?
excuse me, mister... i'm looking for mister rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and i got lost...
...one second.
rinaldi... rinaldi...  what region do you come from?
messina.
emilio? due grappe!  ...why the hell did you come here?
but... he works for your same employer?
yeah, but i don't give a shit about.  i trade at left, at right and that's dangerous in there...
it's a little out of the world coming to visit me this way, on mid afternoon.  it really isn't the usual procedure...
i know... but i'm a little pressed.
...who sent you?
giancarlo... rinaldi.
is he still alive?
yeah... and still in messina.  he's my uncle.
huh? are you alfredo's son, then?
no... dino's.
have you ever been in messina, son?
yes... twice.
did you fish in messina? the "pesce spada"?
no...
it's a specialty down there.  it's a fishing boat with, in front, a long pole near the surface. then, near the cabin, a very tall mast with a little cabin for the lookout.
i think i will get back in messina this summer... it's too long i haven't been there.
you're right, son. you must care the links with your family, always.  it's the only important thing in the world.
...yeah.
salute.
salute.
mathilda, hadn't you told that bullshit to the receptionist, we'd still be in the hotel, i make you notice.
that wasn't bullshit, i said we love each other.
yeah!... anyway, i don't like hotels. too much people, everyone's got the key... i don't like it.
...i prefer apartments...  furthermore, there are always kids in a building. what about getting some friends?
friends? you're crazy!  in my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
you're darkening the picture, aren't you?
a little...
is there a normal 13 or 14 year old boy?
yeah... there's a lot on tv.
it's too big.
yeah... i'm just good for left-overs!
risky business, isn't it?
...you're young, mathilda... you still have a chance to get out.  you can't give up this chance. you have to protect it. there's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
there are just two things i'm interested in: love and death.  for the moment, i have none of the two!
mathilda... there's equally a lot of other things!
huh, really? what? come on, i'm waiting!
no, excuse me... it's the yogurt that made me laugh.
you've just to love me and i'll be the happiest woman around.
yeah, i know! but for the moment you're not yet a woman. so, be patient... i need time... and you too. you have to grow up.
i don't grow up any more. i just get older.
yeah, pal! and i didn't say anything, i said i don't know you.  but do you know what did she say, that stupid raphaella?
no?
she told them you wanted her things and that she wasn't surprised police looked for you! can you believe it?!
asshole. but she won't miss anything, that. you'll see.
good, what are you going to do? do you come back?
no... i can't... i got tired. i want to live my way.
yeah! i was sure! come on, tell me! i know him?
no.
come on, shit, tell me! is he beautiful?
i can't believe it! "yes i think"... how she kids me! i can't believe it!  and did he pass your threshold or not?
...what?
well... did you sleep with him or not?
no... not yet.  he's very shy... and very sensitive.
...good...  but what's special in him?
...i don't know... it's true he touches me. i love him.
you'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, i've got a quite bad opinion about you.  norman smiles.
i respect your business, mister tony. every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  it's right this that makes me nervous, now.  i hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
then...
do you recognize him?
...even his mother wouldn't.
listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. they're lonely, worse than wolves.
may we have this wolf's name and address?
these guys have no place.  they change virtually everyday. and his name...  it's a surname.
you can't sit here like that.
huh? why?
because you have to pay.  it's like a parking meter: if you stay, you pay. it's the rule...
...and how much is it?
ten dollars... a month.
...ok... good.
can i sit on the stairways now?
huh... yeah, yeah... of course.
i'm here, i'll never leave you again, mathilda, never. i swear.
i love you so much, leon.
i love you too, and i don't want to lose you.
poor darling, and then?
well... i proposed them to play roulette...  like we played...  ...and i lost.
well... i don't know, suddenly, the make up... all this... how are you?  are you ok?
of course! i'm fine!  i put on your beautiful dress, i slightly made up...  i tried to get beautiful!  don't you like it?
...don't you drink?
i prefer waiting for a while...  i feel it would go the wrong way.
...no...
...don't you like me?
how many girlfriends did you have?
...i don't know.
well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? how many, approximately?
...mathilda, i don't feel like talking about this.
why? did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  i won't get shocked. i'm used to this!  my father was a true pig. he fucked the bitch i'd as mother all around the apartment. whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  and my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
stop, mathilda! don't talk like that!
...i had a girlfriend... a long time ago.  before coming here, in my country. i was 14-year-old... we flirted like kids...  her father didn't want her to meet me.  my family was not very respectable.
then? you didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you?  you met anyway?
...that's awful.  i hope you killed, that asshole?
...yes. the day he got out of jail. i allowed him to make ten steps... no more. and bang. two hundred meters. by telescope. that night, i left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for tony.  ...i was 17. then, i never left the city...  and never had another girlfriend...
you... you knock the code, when you come back, ok?
yes.
three times, then two times.
may i ask you a personal question?
...yes.
what do you do, with the money you earn?
nothing, for the moment.
maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
yeah, what?
i don't know... getting far away, the two of us, for example...  and forgetting all this...
don't fear.
i have no fear.
why did you unleash the pipe, i don't know?
it will take them five minutes!  how long ago did they arrive?
i don't know... five minutes.
good! snipers can't be in position.
how shall we get out now, leon?
let me work. we'll get out, i tell you!
no! i don't want to leave you!!
mathilda, listen!
no, no! i don't want to go!  i don't want!
you say it just to calm me!
not at all, mathilda! i tell you because it's true! you'll buy the globe you told me about and you will choose, ok? we'll go where you want! i swear, you'll see, mathilda!!
