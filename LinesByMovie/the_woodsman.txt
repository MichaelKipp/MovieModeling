so. how are you adjusting?
I am adjusting okay.
and your new apartment?
apartment's okay.
are you taking your medication?
it gives me headaches.
but you are taking it?
yeah.
and how is your job?
the job's okay.
do i take "okay" to mean you feel good about working there?
i said the job is okay.
that is right, you did.  have you made any friends there?
I am not running for mr. popularity.
you seem a little hostile today.
that was a joke.
it is called sarcasm, dr. rosen.
no need to call me doctor. I am a therapist, not a psychiatrist.
it is all the same.
walter, I would like you to try something for me.
what?
I would like you to keep a journal.
a diary?
that is right.
no way.
why not?
diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
i do not understand.
ev-i-dence.
oh. it never crossed my mind.
of course.
it was just an idea.
bad idea.
i thought a journal would encourage you to reflect.
reflect.
that is right.
you think reflection is good.
it is very good, indeed.
how is that?
by reflection we can derive a deeper meaning from our experience in life. we gain greater understanding about ourselves that can lead to making better choices in our relationships, our careers, and our goals.
try it.
no fucking way.
then think about it.
do not need to think fast to handle beer.
took some talking to convince your super i was a relative.
i told her all my relatives are good- looking.
you look good, damn good, considering you are an old man now!
seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
you doing okay?
got a job at old frank's place. his son runs it now.
oh man, that kid takes himself real serious.
yeah, you still with northland?
foreman now.
no shit.
five years.
beautiful. how is business?
booming. lots of building going on. we can not keep up with all the work. in fact, i just hired a few new guys...
I will never forget you got me started there.
i just recommended you. you still had to prove yourself.
hey, is that a school?
k through sixth.
living across the street from a grade school. jesus.
something wrong with that?
i was just thinking of... the noise.
i like the noise.
one hundred and twenty feet.
what?
law says i can not come within one hundred feet of where children congregate. i figure the distance from my window to the school is one hundred and twenty. make a bet?
no way, man, you would rob me blind!
but maybe it is not so healthy being so close, you know, to a school.
you find me a decent place for under three hundred a month in this town, and I will happily move out of this crap neighborhood.
i should go. your sister worries, and when she worries she yells.
how is she?
annette? she is good... tense.
when can i see her?
I am working on it.
is it because of anna?
i do not know. she will not talk about it.
you are the only one in the family who still talks to me.
i remember when they all referred to me as "the little spic poor annette married." except her brother. you treated me with respect.  look, you paid your dues. your slate is clean now.
how old is anna?
she will be twelve next week. we are throwing a big party on saturday. wish i could ask you to come...
only if it is no closer than a hundred feet.
what?
are you okay?
yeah, I am fucking fantastic.
want a ride?
I am all right.
it is fucking freezing out here.
there is something wrong with this picture.
what picture?
I am talking about you.
me?
yeah, you.
here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. i mean, who rides the bus anymore?
people without cars.
very weird.
no weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
what is weird about that?
most women would not choose it.
guess I am not like most women.
you are quiet at work.
I am just quiet.
you do not hang out with the other guys.
neither do you.
they are all assholes.
you never spoke to me before.
i thought you were a dyke.
are you?
what do you think?
southern light.
what?
your windows face south. northern light is the purest. but southern light is very good.
I will buy a plant.
you should buy several. I have got shitty light in my place, but my plants do not seem to mind. light's important, but it is not everything.
you plan to drink both those beers?
sorry.
is that a school?
k through sixth.
does not it get noisy?
i like the noise.
my place faces a truck street. I have got cracks in every window from the shaking.
you must hate it.
i go backpacking a lot. lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two.
what about bears?
what about them?
they could eat you.
yeah, they could.
i thought you were just shy, but now i think it is something else.
what?
you are damaged.
something happened to you.
yeah?
I am not easily shocked.
i get that impression.
so... what is your dark secret?
why do you want to know?
do not you think i should know before we have sex?
so?
what?
are you going to tell me your deep dark secret before we have sex?
so, you are not a dyke.
not tonight.
hey, that was... intense.
you are still here.
i did not say i did not enjoy it.
of course. sorry. I am such a fucking asshole.
no you are not.
do not tell me I am not a fucking asshole when i know I am a fucking asshole!
what is the problem?
you think i have a problem?
do you?
it is been a while since...
since you have had sex?
tell me about it.
maybe later.
how about in the morning.
the morning?
i thought I would stay the night.
what for?
well, walter, this is going to sound off-the-wall, but i like to sleep with a man after we fuck.
did i say something wrong?
i suffer from insomnia.
is that all?
when i do sleep, i sweat a lot. usually i get nightmares and wake up screaming.
i sleep like a dead horse. anything else?
how is the journal?
I am still thinking about it.
i wish you would give it a try.
you do not like coming here, do you?
it is okay.
but you do not like coming here. be honest, walter.
honest? no.
good. that is an honest answer. and why do not you like coming here?
honest? your cheery personality makes my skin itch.
is it just my cheery personality that makes your skin itch?
forget it.
maybe it is the way i look. or the sound of my name.
rosen? i do not have a problem with that.
because if you did, i know a therapist named ryan. i also know a therapist named chung.
i do not need someone else.
I would keep away from him.
what?
the new man. I would keep away from him, if i were you.
why is that?
you do not want to know, but he is damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what i mean.
yeah, mary-kay, i think i do. thanks a bunch for the advice.
just trying to be helpful.
well, mary, you are about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe. you do know what runs out of a sewer pipe, do not you?
hey, there.
hi.
why do you want to know?
because i like you.
what is the worst thing you ever did?
the worst?
yeah.
so, what did you do?
i molested little girls.
molested little girls?
yeah.
you are not joking.
twelve years in prison is no joke.
look, you can go now.
how many girls did you molest?
sorry.
what did you do to them?
it is not what you think.
how young?
between ten and twelve. once a nine- year-old told me she was eleven. once a fourteen-year-old told me she was twelve. i always asked how old they were.
i never hurt them. never.
twelve years in prison?
the judge had a thing about sex offenders. later i heard his daughter had been raped. if i had not had a good lawyer, it would have been twenty- five to thirty.
why do not you just go now, okay?
i told you I am not easily shocked.
you should be shocked. or do you get off on this shit?
what?
get your kicks somewhere else.
hey, I am not --
depraved? my mistake.
walter.
you do not molest little girls anymore, do you?
no. never again.
what are you doing?
this little table is one heavy bitch.
cherry.
huh?
it is made from cherry. that is a hard wood.
it is a nice table.
notice the grain. see how deep and rich the red runs?
yeah. it is really nice.
it is my own design. you will not find another table like it in the world.
it was a beautiful present.
then why the fuck are you giving it back to me?!
you need a table.
she was going to throw it out, was not she? just toss it like a scrap of wood.
it was not like that.
then what? what?!
she is got all this new furniture now. she said it did not fit anymore, so i kept it in the attic. i thought you might like it.
i made that table for you and annette, for your wedding. i put a lot of love into it.
i know, man. i love this table too.  but i also love my wife.
what is happening?
mariners are pounding the shit out of the tigers.
fucking mariners.
fucking tigers. they got no pitching except for a bunch of green kids straight out of double a or southern cal.  how was the party?
what party?
the birthday party.
oh, anna's. it was great, man. anna was so pretty.  she looked like a princess, like one of those girls in a fairy tale, you know, like snow white.
I have got some pictures.  want to see?
no thanks.
ah, come on.
i do not want to see any goddamn pictures.
how do you feel about that?
i do not feel anything.
you have no feelings for your niece?
she was born after they put me away. how can i have feelings?
then why are you talking about this?
have to talk about something.
what are you afraid will happen?
I am not afraid. I am just saying that carlos has a thing for his daughter, and if he is not careful he is going to suffer.
have you talked to carlos about your concerns?
I am not that crazy.
do you think you are crazy?
if I am not, then what the hell am i doing here?
why do you think you are here?
you know why. it is part of the parole deal.
is that what you are angry about?
talking to you is like riding on a merry-go-round.
that is a marvelous image, walter. because by going in circles we find the things we missed the first time around.
how long is this going to take?
we have a few more minutes.
i mean, when will i be normal.
we have a lot of work to do.
will i ever be normal?
i could not say.
you could not say.
I am afraid not.
do you know what "normal" is?
i suppose it is however society defines it.
how do you define it?
i don't.
then how do you know if your patients are getting better?
they usually tell me.
how do they know?
what is your idea of being normal?
what is your idea of being a jew?
whatever my ideas are of being a jew is not going to help you.  why do not we continue this on thursday.
i want to be normal!
then go see a therapist who will tell you you are normal!
fuck you, rosen!
i know --
you do not know!
i know you are frustrated, walter, but --
what was prison like?
you do not really --
yes! i want to know.
you mean the time you are locked away?
no. prison is time. that is it. you think time, you feel time, you hear time. your heart does not beat to live, it just beats... time.
I am sorry, walter.
do not be sorry for me. i did those things. no one else did. I am dealing with that.
my father took me fishing here when i was a kid. he could name every fish in the lake. and for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. i hated fishing, but i loved his stories.
sounds like a special guy.
my father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave.
I have changed.
why young girls, walter?
is it their innocence? their beauty?...
their power. they seduce me.
they seduce you?
i was always the one seduced.
you really believe that?
no. that is what i used to tell myself.
and what do you tell yourself now?
nothing. it is over.
bullshit.
you know, this is crazy.
what?
being here, with me.
i know.
most people say the odds are against me.
what odds?
the percentages --
for men like me. they say most of us end up back... there. I am saying there are risks... seeing me.
well, most people are stupid.  you want to talk about odds? one day I will tell you how i survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. you wanna talk about odds?
why not tell me now?
i got poked around... here and there.
which brother did this?
all three -- in chronological order.
you must hate your brothers.
i love my brothers.
no you don't.
i love all of them. they are strong, gentle men with families of their own. and if you asked them about what they did to me, they would call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
you never asked them about it?
are you serious?
not ever?
not ever.
hiya, walter.
cop.
sergeant lucas.  may i come in?
you are in.
what is up?
have a seat.
you do not know?
i have no idea.
i think you do.
why do not you just tell me?
i have not broken any laws.
then you will not mind if i look around.
i would.
got something to hide?
does not everybody?
i could get a search warrant.
if you could, you would have brought one today.
cherry?
yeah.
unusual design for a contemporary piece.
it is not for sale.
who said i wanted to buy it?
and when you sit by the window, watching the girls in the little cotton skirts parade by, do you wave your wanger at the girls? is that when you jerk off?
you can not talk to me like --
like a piece of shit? in my eyes, you are a piece of shit. think anyone would miss you if i threw you out the window right now? i could say you jumped when i came in. who are they going to believe? not you, because you would be a dead piece of shit.
okay?
okay.
i do not know.
what did you think would happen?
i do not know.
what did you want to happen?
i do not know!
you know that if anything happens, i spend the rest of my life in prison. no parole, no nothing.
is this the first one?
of course it is! that is why I am telling you!
i want you to calm down.
walter, we will pick up here next time.
i want to talk about it now.
we will talk about it more on thursday.
remember when you asked me what my idea of "normal" was?
go home, walter.
now i know. it is when i can see a girl, be near a girl, even talk to a girl... and walk away.  that is my idea of being normal.
maybe this is not a good idea.
what?
us seeing each other.
you are scared.
I am not scared.
neither am i.
maybe you should be.
we should live together.
live together.
move in with me.
it is a bad idea.
i think it is a fucking good idea.
i do not even know how to live with myself.
just think about it.
I have got problems.
who doesn't?
most people do not have my kind of problems.
guess that makes you pretty special.
that is not what i meant.
i say we call it quits.
fine.
what is this?
what is it look like?
i do not need a plant.
everyone needs a plant. this ivy is one tough baby. it is a cutting from one of mine.
thank you.
you are such an asshole.
do not be scared, walter.
I am not scared.
prove it.
you are very late.
sorry.
please do not do it again.
i said i was sorry.
i can not move my patients around to accommodate one person.
when did it all start?
you mean my problem?
if by "problem" you mean your desire for prepubescent girls, yes.
i do not know.
that is not a helpful answer.
that is my answer.
close your eyes.
what?
I would like you to close your eyes.
why?
to relax.
I am relaxed.
close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
hey, rosen, you going to hypnotize me?
no, i am not going to --
okay. eyes closed, mind a blank. I am all yours. do it, rosen.
when i say the word "girl" what is the earliest image that you can remember?
nothing. can i open my eyes?
no. when i say the word "pretty," when i say the word "pleasure," what is the earliest memory you see?
i do not see --
in your mind, walter. take your time.
who do you see?
i see my sister.
where is she? what is she doing? how old --
not so fast.
sorry.  where is she?
in my bedroom, sleeping.
where?
in my bed, rosen. where do you think?
where are you?
in my bed too.
how old are you and your sister?
we are little kids.
but roughly, how old?
I am maybe about six... which would make her four.
and what are you doing?
just lying there.  we are taking a nap.
a nap?
yes, a nap. kids do that. you ever take a nap, rosen?
what the hell are you doing there?
did you and your sister often take naps together?
i want you back in your chair! right now!
do not ever do that again.
all right.
i do not like nobody behind my back!
I am sorry. i should not have been there.
walter, what did you do while taking a nap with your sister?
nothing.
did you touch her? did you take off her clothes? did you take off your clothes?
this is garbage!
I am only asking questions.
okay I will tell you what i did -- just to shut you up!  i smelled her hair.
what else?
that is all. i just liked smelling her hair.
you felt pleasure.
yes.
did you get an erection?
i was six years old!
i meant later... when you two took naps.
when the two of you held each other. when you were ten or eleven and she was eight or nine. when your parents were out and the two of you were alone... completely alone in that big house.
it was a small house.
all right. a small house... with small rooms.
i smelled her hair. that is it. i just liked smelling her hair.
I have got some good news.
what is that?
annette will see you.
are not you glad?
when?
soon.
next week? the week after?
early july.
anna will be away at camp. the house will be quiet. it is better when it is quiet.
tell annette I am busy in july.
c'mon, walter.
you should see my appointment book. it got crazy.
it is not what you think.
is not it?
the important thing is that you and annette need to talk. she needs to see you, and you need to see her.
I am not a monster.
you are a good man, walter. okay, you did some wrong things, but inside you are a good, decent man.
maybe I am not a good man. maybe inside I am bad, and I will always be bad.
do not talk like that.
i get horny as hell for other women.  i mean i fantasize about raping some beautiful woman.
you do not have to tell me this.
I am just talking, man.
carlos, i never raped a woman.
i know. I am just saying i understand.
it is crazy out there.  young girls wearing mini this and mini that. sometimes when i walk down the street and pass some sexy looking woman, she makes me feel like I am bothering her. she stares down like she is afraid to look at me. why she do that? why can not she look me in the face?
maybe because you are looking her in the face.
carlos, can i ask you something?
sure.
nothing.
ask me. ask me anything.
did you ever... do you have feelings for anna?
what do you mean?
i mean... feelings.
do not do that.
do what?
sneak up behind me like that.
what is your fucking problem?
why is it always my fucking problem?
what is going on?
nothing.
i did not sleep well.
do you want to talk about it?
i need a shower.
what are you looking at?
birds.
there is a million birds here.
in that birch tree is a nest.
there is little chicks!  you want to see?
sure.
they are starlings.
is that right?
i do not like starlings.
why not?
they are extremely aggressive birds. plus, their habits are rather filthy.
the mother sure has her hands full.
you always carry these?
when i go bird-watching. it is why i like coming here.
it is just a city park.
you would be surprised how many kinds of birds you will see here. last week i saw a purple martin. and the week before that, i saw a solitary vireo. that is rare.
a solitary vireo. i like that one.
their sound is quite musical.
how does it sound?
it is hard to describe.
try.
i can't.
i bet you can.
I would love to hear it.
it is a bright sound.
something like that.
that was terrific.
you should hear the bird.
you live around here?
not too far.  are you a bird-watcher too?
me? nah. I am more of a people watcher.
were you watching me?
not at first. you would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. any second i thought you would take off and fly.
i have to go.
do you come here often?
my daddy likes me home before dark.
it is good to listen to your daddy.
too much sun.
what?
your ivy. too much direct sunlight. these plants do not like a lot of sun.
they grow outside, do not they?
sure they do. but outside they have got trees around them. the trees shade them from the sun. of course, the plants enrich the soil around the trees. one of nature's symbiotic relationships.
you going to take me on a nature walk?
do not be witty.  yesterday you took the number twelve bus from work, but instead of getting off at your normal stop, for some reason you stayed on. why did you stay on the bus, walter?
i fell asleep.
you walked home.
yes.
this one guy on death row, who I will call henry, told me about his last victim. henry says how he is in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named adele. her mother's in the living room watching tv. she is got the volume on so damn high he can hear david letterman's jokes. henry puts his hand over adele's mouth and says, "if you scream, little girl, I will kill your mother." and of course little adele does not scream, does not cry, does not make a sound. then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door.  ten days later they find adele's body. or what is left of it.  you believe in fairy tales?
fairy tales?
do you believe in them?
no.
neither do i.  what is the one with the woodsman?
woodsman?
the one with the ax?
i do not know.
sure you do. he cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive.
little red riding hood.
that is it. little red riding hood jumps out of the wolf's guts with hardly a scratch.  ever see a seven-year-old girl sodomized almost in half?
you knew her?
what?
the girl.
have you seen walter?
lovers' quarrel?
people have the right to know.
if she is here tomorrow, I will fucking kill her.
see anything interesting?
not yet.
what are you writing in that book?
it is my bird book.
do not you have friends?
i have friends.
a pretty girl like you should have a lot of friends.
I am not pretty.
well... not in the common way.
what does that mean?
it means uncommon beauty is commonly overlooked. most people only notice birds with the brightest colors.
you tell me your name, I will tell you mine.
robin.
yeah, like the bird.
can i ask how old you are?
I am twelve.
no you are not.
i will be in three months.  i can not wait. i hate being eleven. it has to be the stupidest age in the world.
walter.
do you have many friends?
no.
how come?
a long time ago, i was sent far away. when they let me come back, all my friends were gone.
it sounds like you were banished.
banished... yeah.
birds are my friends. that sounds egotistical, but they are. birds know i watch them, but they do not mind because they like being watched... if they know you will not hurt them.
robin?
yes?
would you like to sit on my lap?
what?
would you like to sit on my lap?
no thank you.
are you sure?
I am sure. thank you all the same.
that is okay... does not matter.
do you want me to sit on your lap?
i know a place in the park where only very small birds go. there are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. it is quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. would you like me to take you there?
they sound like finches.
they could be finches. i do not know. we should go before it gets dark.
my daddy lets me sit on his lap.
does he?
yes.
do you like it when he asks you?
what is her name?
ms. kramer.
tell ms. kramer what your daddy does.
i can't.
yes you can, robin.
you said you could not make the sound of a solitary vireo. but you did. beautifully. i heard you.
what will happen if i do?
someone will talk to your daddy. and then he will stop doing those things... the things you do not like.
but will he... ?
your daddy will always love you.
how do you know?
i know because... it is just something i know.
i do not want to hurt my daddy.
robin, listen to me.
walter?
yes?
do you still want me to sit on your lap?
no.
i do not mind.
you should go home.
can not i stay a little longer?
it is getting dark. go home.
will i see you again?
you do not know?
know what?
I will be asking the questions.  last night, you hear anything unusual? screams? shouts?
no.
a man was badly beaten across the street. you know anything about that?
i was asleep.
i did not say what time the assault occurred.
you said last night. i went to bed pretty early.
the assault took place at approximately seven thirty.
i went to bed around seven.
i was not feeling well.
i could take you downtown.
you could. it would be a waste of your time, though.
he i.d.'d the assailant. the description matches you pretty well.
i suppose if you are looking for a male between the ages of thirty and fifty, medium height, medium weight, medium build. probably not too many men fit that bill.
just give me a straight answer, walter, cause the irony goes right over my head.
that is a nasty scratch on your neck.
i have a passionate girlfriend.
what is with the boxes?
you are a cop. figure it out.
I would say you are moving.
it is a free country, is not it?
the passionate one?
yes.
then I would say you are a lucky fellow.
i count my blessings.
well, i guess I will be seeing you.
you sure you do not know nothing about this?
'fraid not.
you okay?
yeah.
fucking liar.
i heard they were filthy birds.
not when they fly.
she is still really hurt... and angry. i do not know... if she will ever... forgive me. i understand that. i do. i just hope... i just want her to...
accept you?
it is going to take time, walter.
time.
how do you feel about that?
i feel... okay.
