i hate scary movies.
it'll be okay, baby, i'll hold your hand.
if we hurry, we can still catch the sandra bullock movie.
we got free tickets.
take it off.
but...
now.
now why does she have to be naked? how does that serve the plot?
sssshhh. on screen the phone rings. the young girl pulls the shower curtain aside to reveal a robe hung on a hook. she grabs it, running from the bathroom, into the living room, grabbing the phone.
why doesn't she just hang up and call the police? stupid..
shush.
i'm gonna pee. you want anything?
you ass.
i'm sorry, i'm sorry but i had to. it was too easy.
you are so not funny.
come on, baby. lighten up a little, will ya?
i get scared really easy, okay.
you gotta go with it. scary movies are great foreplay.
i just have a hard time with insipid, sexist violence.
we can still sandra bullock it.
sandra started without us. we can stay. he kisses her again, then breaks away.
a patio chair comes flying through a glass door. the young girl in the movie tears off running, screaming, flying through the room.
the crowd is really with the movie. some even talk to the screen. "you dumb bitch. get out of the house." etc.
the young girl runs by a window. she looks in. a ghost masked killer stares back. the figure crashes through the window attacking her. she fights him off, getting away, running...
everyone in the theater is screaming. maureen tries her best to detach herself from the movie. she eats her popcorn.
the ghost advances on the young girl, grabbing her, pulling her to him, raising high a long, hunting knife. the young girl is helpless...
maureen looks at phil, confused...as if seeing for the first time...it's not phil. she pulls away when, the ghost-masked figure grabs her with one hand, the other one clutching the hunting knife. maureen sees it, her mouth billowing forth a loud scream that is matched by the entire audience as they scream at the screen.
the young girl, clutching her bloody chest...drags herself, crawling across wet grass...the killer behind her...raising his knife again.
popcorn flies as maureen falls forward, into the aisle, clutching her bloody stomach. she's speechless, unable to scream. she holds her bloody hand out for all to see, begging for help. she stumbles down the aisle. someone yells "sit down." maureen turns to several people who begin to react. she turns behind her to see the ghost face coming at her again...knife raised.
the young girl is slashed again.
the knife slices into maureen again...then again. the theatre audience is starting to take note as the ghost keeps slashing at her repeatedly with the knife. a horrifying, sickening sight.
knock yourself out.
hello?  hello?
time to change numbers again?
nah...i think it'll die off. it's opening weekend. let's see how it goes.
three hundred people watched? nobody did anything?
they thought it was a publicity stunt.
oh my god. how could it happen?
they don't know. it was carefully planned. earlier in the day the victims received anonymous passes to the movie.
it's a copycat killer i knew this would happen. that fucking movie.
as of now, they don't see any relation. but they're checking it out. the state, special task force, fbi--they're all here. they'll find the guy.
yeah, right.
look, sid, why don't you take off? disappear for a few days. i'll come with you.
no. i will not crawl under a rock. this is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. i'll just get used to it.
you go, it's all stairs, i can take it from here.
don't worry...
dewey, i'm completely equipped with mace, alarm whistle, keyring, knife, a degree in defensive combat...
just in case...
no. this is nothing, dewey. i'll be okay. go back to work and let me get back to my quasi pseudo-happy existence.
lucas and his romper room stage.
i got. i got it. friday the 13th, part 20.
how are you? you weren't in class. i called as soon as i heard...
i skipped. too many "that's her" looks.
i'm sorry, baby. what can i do'?
don't ask what you can do. no coddling. life rolls on status quo.
look, i'm sorry about the face.
job hazard. debbie salt, stringer-- newsweek. answer a few questions?
fair enough.
what are you doing here? i thought you had retired from field reporting?
well, you know i'm dear to the subject matter.
and much richer as a result.
do i know you? you look familiar.
i took your vulture seminar seminar at berkeley last year.
good for you.
have they questioned you yet, sid?
this has nothing to do with me, joel. there's an estimated 270 serial killers currently active in the us at any given time. i can't control that. who's hungry?
i have rehearsal.
i have to watch rehearsal.
i gotta hit the library. anatomy. some of us have real majors. you gonna be okay, sid?
you're not allowed to ask that.
i'll stop by the deltas tonight.
thanks, joel.
..this week's tke kegger...
ne ask that you sell individual squares of toilet paper for a mere nickel a piece.
we've set you each at a five dollar quota.
it's okay. i can peddle toilet paper.
sid, you don't have to.
how do you put up with this greek shit?
hey, it's cool. hallie's into it, i'm into hallie...
hello, dwight.
miss weathers.
i've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
i'm on crowd patrol, miss weathers, excuse me.
yes, miss weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.
i see you read the book.
yes, i do retain reading skills. shock.
and an explanation is, of course, out of the question.
page 32. "deputy dewey filled the room with his dim-witted barney fifish presence." i think you've explained yourself.
oh dewey, i'm sorry.
no, what you are is a money hungry, fame- seeking liar and--forgive me for saying-- mediocre writer who has a cold storage shed where her heart should be.
you have every right to be upset.
page 41. "deputy dewey oozed with inexperience."
i never meant to imply...
how do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
i'm sorry. i don't know what else to say except i'm sorry.
no, i'm the one who's sorry. i misjudged you. now if you'll excuse me, i have some oozing to do.
sidney. hello. how are you?
i'm okay. people magazine won't stop calling but other than that...
i'm sorry.
yeah, well...you are the definition of mixed emotions. i really should hate you... i see your movie's getting good reviews.
it seems to be causing a stir. what's with the toilet paper?
it's hell week. i'm pledging the deltas.
it's good to see you involved.
my morn was a delta.
no, they broke up again. bailey won't stop drinking and sarah can't take it anymore.
thought he was doing aa.
no, he quit - the whole god thing--he has issues. the previews for next week...
yes.
who is this?
cici. who's this?
someone who wants to talk to you.
ted? where are you? are you drinking? hold on.
that shit. he only calls you when he's drunk. don't go over there.
i won't.
don't. think bailey.
alright, alright...i'll call you back.
oh, i'm sorry. my bad.  i thought you were someone else.
that's okay.
who do you want to speak with? nobody's here.
where is everybody?
we're co-sponsoring the acid rain mixer at the sig ep. house tonight.
why aren't you there?
i'm designated driver. i have to be here in case a sister calls and needs a ride.
that's too bad.
"drink with your brain." that's our motto. who are you calling for?
what if i said you?
what if i said goodbye?
why would you wanna do that?
why do you always answer a question with a question?
i'm inquisitive.
i'm impatient. look, do you wanna leave a message for someone?
no, some creep asshole trying to scare me.
it's hell week. chill. the movie murders have brought out the crazies. it's nothing.
shit.
what is it?
i heard a noise.
where?
kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
stop it...
i can't believe you're alone in that house.
outside.
that's smart.
don't do that. hang up...call...
what? i can't hear you...
hang up...call...
i'm losing you.
...campus security...send someone...check out...place...
okay, okay. i'll call now. i'll call you back.
jesus, you scared me. what are you doing here?
i live here.
i thought you were going to the mixer?
i had to change. did anyone call?
just some asshole trying to scare me.
tina, it's dawnie. i'm  on my way. cici follows her back into the living room.
i'll go. i don't mind. really.
hello? ted?
no, it's me.
whaaaatt?
don't forget to set the alarm.
where have you been'? you missed my shining moment. i won the macaroni sundae binge.
i'm sorry honey. i got behind.
about what?
the forbidden subject.
have you checked the...
attic, garage, basement, nothing.
take the neighborhood.
lemme take you home.
i'll get my jacket.
we don't know if it's random. we haven't been able to connect the victims.
the first two were stabbed without thought. the sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
we know that, son.
the killer was trying to get to her. that sorority girl was a distraction.
we're aware of that.
jesus christ. captain tyler flies out of his seat and into action.
find me every variation of himbry and what was the other name...
how many guys they have on you?
i counted four.
okay, you're sure about skipping calculas?
please, i have the perfect excuse.
what about rehearsal?
gotta.
i'll cover you through rehearsal. derek when do you get outta docu- drama?
two.
so you'll relieve me at 2:30...
and watch her til 8:00--i've got to edit.
perfect. i'll be outta micro-bio and we can grab a bite.
guys, guys, i'm sorry but, no way.
shut up. mickey, you and i can take her late evening.
sig ep's gotta band, tonight.
too bad.
this is exactly what i don't want.
i think it's out of your control.
sid, i'll seeya tonight.
but...
my screwed up life shouldn't have to bleed onto my friends.
let us decide that.
what about your film? isn't it due next week? have you even started it?
it's under control.
hi, gale, any leads?
tons and tons.
where is sidney's father?
home--where he lives.
and are the police sure about that?
why don't you ask them?
already did. he's the perfect suspect, don't you think?
no, i don't.
parents are always responsible. it all starts in the home.
look, i know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. okay? i'm not interested in the scoop anymore. excuse me.
who is this?
i'll give you one guess.
who are you?
that's not the way we play the game.
i don't play games.
what if your life depended on it?
what do you want?
you're pretty when you're angry.
where are you?
i'm everywhere.
oh--a god complex
stay away from the cop.
what do you want from me?
it's what you want from me.
what do you mean?
you are writing another book, aren't you? that's why you're here. the story's not over.
you're getting obvious.
no, gale, i'm just getting started. seeya soon.
no, wait...
watch your back.
that was good.
yeah, right.
who is that guy?
it's okay. look, hallie, i'll meet you outside.
no, girletta, i don't leave your side.
i've got my entourage. take a break. please.
what do you want?
i'm sorry, sid, please. i never should have gone along with gale. i know i'm stupid. i wish i had some good reason to give you but i'm just stupid. please, sid, don't be mad at me.
do you work for her now?
well, yeah...she gave me a job. freelance. it got me outta woodsboro. i'm sorry about cotton and yesterday. it was a bad idea. i knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. ah, shit, sid, i'm fucked up. sidney looks at him long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
me, too. randy. me too.
i can do it, captain.
thanks, dewey, but i was thinking i'd pull jesse off...
how's the name search going?
37 usages of himbry  located in the registar's office. 9 tatum's, 47 riley's. and that's just on campus. it's hopeless.
my documentary is due on tuesday.
what's your subject?
i was a sorority slut.
where's sid?
damned if i know. she ditched me.
you weren't supposed to leave her alone.
i didn't say she was alone. that guy-- from her home town showed up. they went off together.
i've been waiting for you, baby.
is that cool? just to leave her like that?
she's got guards with her.
what guy?
randy somebody.
randy meeks.  he was with sid that night in woodsboro.
her old boyfriend?
no, she killed her boyfriend. randy was a friend. mickey watch out, derek.
he tried to kill her first.
is sid in therapy?
i could use some therapy.
should we be worried about this guy? isn't it kinda weird he just showed up and now people are dying?
he seemed harmless.
aren't most serial killers seemingly harmless?
and white.
easy black boy.
it's documented. most serial killers are attractive--slightly off white males in their twenties.
i got a surprise for you.
what?
"if i should stay. i would only be in your way. so i'll go. and yet, i know, i'll think of you each step of the way...
don't do this.
"and iiiiiiiiiyeiiiii will always love you oooooowuoooooooo will always love you."
i think he's doing dolly.
"and i hope life treats you kind and i hope you have all you dreamed of offffff. i wish you joyyy."
definitely whitney.
you're going to get it. you know what happens.
but i love you. and i want the whole world to know it.
cotton.
can we talk?
i don't think that's a good idea.
look, yesterday wasn't my idea. that was all gale and dollar signs and ratings.
what do you want from me, cotton?
you could start with an apology.
i did that.
you wrote me a letter. very cordial. very appropriate.
how? what could i say that would make a difference? i took away a year of your life--how do i apologize for that?
i wish it was just a year. i lost everything because of you. i have nothing now. look at me, this is what i've become. a long silence. sidney is hanging on by threads.
cotton, there isn't one day, one hour, one minute when i'm not reminded of what i've done. i have not had one second of reprieve and no therapy or religion or spiritual plane can ever erase what i feel in every vein of my being. and i wish i had in me what you need to hear but i don't think the words exist.
i just thought if i saw you face to face, maybe it would help.
did it?
it helped me realize one thing.
what?
you're a self-obsessed little cunt like your mother.
if he's innocent he'll have an alibi.
i guess gale's going to be pissed she missed her exclusive.
i'll relay it. you sure you don't wanna go home?
i have this button i press. see? it insulates me. she mimes an air lock valve.
i gotta coupla of those buttons myself.
thanks for the movie, randy.
anytime. sorry it sucked. it just had that been there done that feeling.
i had the four o'clock shift. you weren't there. you had us worried. is everything okay?
no, it's not.
i don't really know what happened in woodsboro, sid. but i know you don't trust me.
it's not you, derek. i don't trust myself. i tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
then i'll make this easy for you. i like you. i'm crazy about you, sid. but i'm gonna stay away. until you say otherwise.
so what made you change your mind about sidney?
mood swing. i'm manic depressive.
you're a hard one to figure out. gale it's that complex yet shallow quality. it's deliberate.
i think you're all an act.
and deep down i'm a good person? make no mistake, dewey, i'm a shit.
i know that.
yeah?
i also know that you're an aging tv reporter slash writer who, despite huge tabloid success, has some self worth issues regarding your personal life which directly effects your professional life in a non-positive manner. a coupla failed relationships with--i'm guessing balding, older men--have turned you into this bitch with a cell phone. but i bet sometimes, late at night, when you're all alone a sadness seeps to the surface and in a moment of clarity you know that all you really want is to be touched and held and fondled.
hello?
gale?
she's not here right now.
but she's standing right next to you.
what do you care? let 'em have their fun. so, what's up?
what's your favorite scary movie?
showgirls. absolutely frightening. what's yours? wait, let me guess. the house on sorority row? final exam. graduation day? the dorm that dripped blood? splatter university? am i close?
closer than you think.
do you want to die?
gee, let me think. "do you want to..." is that the best you can do? some tired hand me down rehash? hey, pal, no one's gonna write a book about you. no movie rights. nothing. i've been through this before and much better i might add.
he's broken his pattern.
they've broken their pattern.
you're sure about this two person thing?
broad daylight, a crowded movie theatre. this is too much fun for one person.
i would say we are now officially baffled.
on national television.
not good. how you doin?
not good.
can't we hold him?
no, we got pressure from california state. the man practically has clemency. we can't run the risk of falsely accusing him. he has to be standing over the victim with knife in hand before we make a move.
what now?
you know the story, gale. man falsely accused, sent to prison, proved innocent, released back into the real world and never trusted again. want the exclusive?
did you do it?
now, gale, you were so instrumental in my freedom. you're not having character doubts now, are you?
you have a right to be angry.
no, gale, i don't have any rights. you made sure of that.
cotton, i've done nothing but help you.
you've done nothing but get rich off of me. how many books have you sold, gale? you think i don't understand points and royalties and ancilliary rights?
don't do anything stupid, cotton. you've come to far.
gale, i don't know what i'm doing from one moment to the next. i'm just taking it as it comes.
we're going to bring her in. hide her out for a coupla days. and we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. no one is allowed out after dark.
that doesn't work, sir.
it's all about sisterhood. everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
..it's really about family and tradition...
..harmonica style is okay.
i just love being a sister.
are they aware of your not so positive portrayal of greek life?
not one bit.
where's sid?
she dumped me.
no way.
yeah.
you freakin?
we're missing the sig ep party.
no, hallie, not tonight. parties and mass murderers don't go together. trust me.
no, no, i hadn't planned on going, it's just mickey will be pissed.
it's okay to break, girl. you shatter if you have to.
i'd really just like to be alone.
the police are waiting outside. they're going to take you somewhere safe.
dewey, there's no such place.
humor me, sid.
can i come with her?
no, hallie, i'm not gonna take you down too. i'll be alright.
sid, i'll come with you.
but who would operate your camera?
i'm the only one who can cut him down.
it's not a good idea, hallie.
if you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
meaning?
he's already gotta be a part of sid's life. what do you know about this derek?
solid alibis. he was with sidney when she was attacked.
billy had alibis too.
hey, i got stuff to do. but i'll find you later, okay.
whatever.
you broke my heart.
what are we looking for?
a bloody knife. a ghost mask. something like that?
can we turn the light on?
that's not the way it's done.
and it's sexier in the dark.
dewey, you and i would never make it.
maybe not. but think about the sex. as frustrated as i am...
..and as lonely as i am...
we'd break some furniture.
they're roomates.
and joel's pre-med.
the sorority girl was gutted with autopsy precision.
shit! it's both of them. the first murders were to throw us - using the same names as woodsboro. but they've moved on- -they're getting closer to sidney. they're not looking for a himbry or a tatum to kill. they're looking for the new tatum.
hallie?
ssshh! what was that?
let's find out.
this is all too familiar.
over here.
maybe they never got here. he could have taken her anywhere.
c'mon. let's go.
jesus christ!
he filmed his victims.
let's go.
no, wait here.
dewey?
there's nothing. i'm coming down.
sid? jesus, where's hallie? i've been here all night.
listen to me. we've got to get help. the killer's here.
what are you talking about?
he's after me.
i'll be right back.
where you going?
what was that?
don't panic.
someone’s trying to kill me. i need the police.
are you in danger now?
yes, goddammit!
where is your attacker?
i don’t know.
stay under the safety light. help is on its way.
the safety what? fuck that!
go on, untie him.
no. this is a set up.
that’s quick.
need some help, honey.
i got it..
yeah, you look quizzical yet pensive.
yeah, how can we help? do you have any questions regarding the sequel of your life?
why?
good question. you took the bait.
ever see natural born killers? well, derek and i have this whole mickey/mallory-woody harrelson/juliette lewis thing going on.
i really don’t like that comparison, honey.
he hates oliver stone.
i find his work overwrought.
he sent me the cutest e-mail.
i read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. hook, line...
we have our own website now. we dedicated a whole page to you.
you’d me amazed at how many of us there are out there. it’s a whole world, sid. you’re really popular amongst the demented.
you’re the one who got away.
until now.
poor cotton, could life be a little more cruel?
you’re not going to get away with this.
of course not. who wants to? what’s the point if we don’t get caught? where’s the glamour in that?
the way i see it. we’ll be arrested. go to prison. cash in on the home footage. secure a book deal. if all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of stab ii.
a verdict and premiere all on the same day. i love it.
we’re hoping for the death penalty. i have this whole dead man walking swan song exit planned.
and now, drum roll please...
hope you’re ready, sid. we got one last surprise for you.
a twist ending if you will.
yeah, we really had our work cut out for us. it really is the curse of the sequel. the billy/stu thing’s been done.
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
and we didn’t want to do that, sid. we wanted to give you your money’s worth.
so we found a compromise.
or it found us.
we have a surprise guest star waiting in the wings.
just for you, sid.
wait a sec, derek. we forgot to flip.
oh yeah.  we figure the one of us that actually kills you will get a little more press. it’s been an ongoing discussion.  heads or tails?
tails.
yeah, we’re trying to send a message to hollywood. i’m really getting tired of all the happy endings. it’s just not reality. in the real world the good guys die, the innocent are punished, and the murderers inherit the earth.
but nobody wants to see that. it’ll never go. they’ll rewrite you. you don’t want that.
oh, sid, you’re sounding desparate. i guess fearing death makes one anxious.
you fucking freaked out movie nut psychos..
what?
oh my god.
i couldn’t believe you didn’t recognize me. you even interviewed me for your book.
you’re all in this together?
we had to have financing.
tuition’s expensive.
jesus, you’re just as whacked as your son.
where do you think he got it? mental illness is heriditary. who do you think incouraged him to kill your mother? he was a smart kid but children need parental guidance.
what are you going to do?
finish what my son started.
but you’ll never get away with it.
enter cotton weary.
it’s perfect, sidney. no one will ever suspect me. i have proof. i’m the victim.
please, cotton, don’t do this.
i get my revenge and make some fast cash.
it’s over, cotton.
not until you’re dead.
