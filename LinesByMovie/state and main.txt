...not at all...
...we need the shooting permit for main street...
<u>whatever</u> you need.  the city council, of course, has to pass on your...
...the city council...
on your "permit," but that is less than a formality.
...it is?

what i am <u>saying</u>, is, we have to look out for our own...now:  they want to close down main street...
annie:  you stick to the amateur theatricals.  this isn't quite the same thing, you see?  this is big business, in which, our life...  ...s'no less a <u>commodity</u> than...than our...

how can i thank you?  how can i repay you for this part?  it's a...what a, thank you for this part.  the first scene at the old mill...
what, what's there to <u>think</u> about?  the scene's perfect...i, i get to say...
yes, but, joe, <u>joe's</u> been, well, he's just been having a few, uh, "thoughts," about...
how many times in your <u>life</u> do you get a speech like that?
yeah.
this scene is why i'm doing the movie. "look at the mill, frank -- look at the way it goes around...<u>half</u> of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
yes, yes, but...
"...but still it rises up...it rises up, frank, high as it can go."
yeah.  joe?  would you, uh, tell claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
so young, so unlined, so full of promise.  so innocent.
i beg your pardon?
i quit.
you quit.
i quit the movie.
why did you quit?
actually, i'm not sure if i quit.  i think that i got fired.  i'm such a liar. i never could tell the truth.
don't be so hard on yourself.
i just got kicked off my first movie.
well.  everybody has reversals.  if you were never down how would you know when you were up?
that's good.  that's really good.  you have a gift for words.
it's in your play.
you like my play.
yes.
why?
it's about life.
could you tell me when's the next train?
n'about ten minutes.  what was your movie about?
no, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
it's about a man who gets a second chance.
evening, annie.
evening, cal.  would you tell me about it?
i...
no, of course, you want to get out of town.
it's...
ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?
first organized fire department was on the border of dalmatia and sardinia in the year 642.
but why the dalmation?
it was either that, or a sardine.
you get what you pay for.
that's true.  you grow up here?
central high, 'n' matinees, the bijou theatre.
...that...that he <u>prayed</u> for a second chance.  but...do you see?
yes.
that, he says, there <u>are</u> no second chances...that he's been presented what he <u>prayed</u> for...and: he's ruined it.
yes...
but, but but but...
no, no, i see...
that: in an act of...
yes...
of <u>mercy</u>...off...
i understand...
...that...he <u>sees</u> that...
as the old mill goes around...
of course, of course that's what i'm <u>saying</u>.  as the old mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
of course.
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
that's that's that's that's beautiful...
and you're the only one who'll ever hear that speech.  just you.
well.  it was a pleasure meeting you.
and likewise.
goodbye.
goodbye.
so that the old mill, the old <u>mill</u> represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
no, no.  of course, that's <u>exactly</u> what it represents...
that whole...
the, the, the, the <u>sanctity</u> of everyday things...
everyday things...yes.
for example, he's just come back from a <u>fire</u> and he...um...  that's a fine house.  you look at that, and you know, there's nice people that live there.
i live there.
really.  with the porch swing and everything...
surest thing you know.
i don't mean to impose, but...do you think we might...
that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...
...i always thought so...
...such a pleasant sound.
mmm.
cause, cause, it's...it's the <u>simple</u> things, that...
yes...

i want to make a good film.
i know you do.
and maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, i...
hey, it's with the gods.  we don't have the money, we have to write it out.  the best or not.  and that's a lesson.  you get your typewriter yet...?
um, no.

what are they offering?
ten thousand dollars.
that's so beautiful...
i beg your pardon?
"the mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed.  <u>although</u> it is altered..."

i...i decided to give it another chhh...
i love your script.
in fact, in fact, in fact, i'm not sure if i'm giving <u>them</u> a second chance, or they're giving it to me.  that's the truth.  the truth's best, don't you think?
you'd know better'n me.
how can you <u>say</u> that?
it's in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  innit?  "you <u>can</u> go back..."
i <u>can</u>?
you bet your life.  "the mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."
but how do i...how do i do a film called "the old mill," when i don't have an old mill?
well, first, you got to change the title...
we need a new name for the movie. where's the writer?
wally, i got to takes out that window from the dog.  i can't shoot through...
why?
because they gots a window with a dogs in it.  you want me to "push in."  or i can lose the shot.
no you can't lose the shot.  the meaning of the <u>film</u> <u>is</u> in that shot.
but, wally, the window of the <u>firehut</u>...
i don't care.  <u>fix</u> it.

...i know...i know...
...and, and, and did she...?  and she did the seven shows...
no, she didn't claire.  but i think you should do the scene.

no, i don't...
he doesn't go back to the <u>mill</u>, he gets a second chance to go back to the <u>firehouse</u>...
this is, look:  go you huskies.  ...what <u>i</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, fire and <u>water</u>.  the firehouse, and the <u>old mill</u>...do you know, you could...

i wasn't doing business.
oh.  what were you doing, then, that's so important that you shouldn't call your fian...
it's all over between us, doug, i'm sorry, but that's the truth.  i've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end.  i'm sorry.  it isn't <u>you</u>, j...
wai...it's so serious you couldn't call to tell me you'd be...what...?  what did you say...?
it's all over between us.  i've found someone else.
let me review here: you're...what are you...you've...it's all over between us?
i'm sorry.
who is this person that you've found?
he works on the movie.
no.  don't tell me that.
i'm sorry.
why, you <u>whore</u>!
look.
i feel so <u>close</u> to you...
look, look, i like you <u>very much</u>...
i like you, too.
but not that <u>way</u>...
but we...
look, look there's someone else...
great.  who is it...?
"room service!"
would you go in...
would you put on your cl...  just leave it outside.
you have to sign for it.
i'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
oh, god...
and here's some hydrogen peroxide.
i don't drink.
it's for your finger.
one moment.
you have to hide.
who is that...?
that's my...
oh.
will you help me out...?
i...
hi.
you going to ask me in?
thank you.
read the card.
"to the love of my life, love, doug"?
the other side.
oh.
don't you think you should put them in water?
why?
...because if you don't, they die...
start?  this isn't a good time.
oh.  that's alright.  then i'll come back at a better time.  what would be a better time?
later on.
then i'll come back, then.
you, um, you, um, you going out with your fiance?
no, i just broke up with him.  i'll see you tomorrow.
hi.  i hope i'm not disturbing...
she came in here, wait, she...i was giving her a massage...wait...wait!  she came in here...she...  ...with respect...she took off her clothes, and she got in <u>bed</u>, i told her i could not--we don't know each other, you see...
...we had a script conference...
i told her thank you very much, but it was inconvenient because...uh... because...
you can do it.
because i'd met someone else.
oh <u>okay</u>.
you believe that?
i do if you do.
but it's absurd.
so is our electoral process.  but we still vote.
do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
i used to go out with a politician.
you used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
sure did.
why?
time for a change.  keep your margins straight.
yes.
go you huskies!
where the hell have you been...?  it's...
sherry, this...
i've got two days to get this house...
dear, this is mr. rossen, he is the producer...
i am so glad to meet you.  we are so glad to <u>have</u> you here, and <u>welcome</u> you to our...i, you know, they had c...i'm, <u>yearly</u> i redecorate our, to restore it to the, 1835...
what is that...?
...the house, the 1835.  the original <u>kitchen</u>, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
it's lovely.
a spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the waterford huskies...
my oh my.
i'm...tuesday evening we're having an informal dinner, i didn't know you'd be 'on set,' but if you'd like to join your...
i have to talk to you.
doug, this is mr...
...he's the producer of the movie.
i want you to hear this, pal...  forget the overages, <u>forget</u> ten thousand dollars for three days to two weeks.  you know what it would cost for them to <u>build</u> this set?  two million dollars!  now:
doug...
now:  the waterford merchant's association, of who i am council...
"assembly of death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
you think so?
waal, what was the per-screen average...?
good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
i can't get it to come out right.
what's the scene...
it used to be the old mill.
what've you got?
they meet on main street.  her horse has just died.  he's coming from the fire.
what about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling <u>you</u> how to wr...
<u>please</u>...
how about, he sees her on the street, he wipes the soot from his eyes.  he goes up to her.  "what happened to the horse?" she looks at him.  she takes his hand...
ah.  ah.  ah...
i hurt you?
...he stuck a fishhook in it.
she <u>realizes</u> -- it was not the fire which <u>hurt</u> him...that the <u>true</u> hurt was her. was her...
...yes.
...her unbridled sexuality.  that he...
...yes.
has been wounded by <u>her</u> heat...by her <u>infidelities</u>...
because it's about <u>purity</u>...
that's...that's <u>exactly</u> what it's about. take...
that's right...
...take <u>any</u> two people...
...the finest people you could ever hope to work with...  you have the new old mill pages?
i can't find the writer.
...totally false...<u>totally</u> false.  he is the, i would say the most responsible human being i have ever...
i have to talk to you.  my wife...
not now.
my wife is going to have a baby, and...
oh, that's <u>great</u>.  let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
not now, i'm talking to the press. claire!
what?  i have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
i, uh...  i've always thought so...  well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form.  i've written a letter to the studio and to sag protesting...  bill: get a copy of that letter...!  i just wanted to tell you that i am <u>past</u> chagrined, i'm <u>mortified</u> at the way you were spoken to...
i...
an artist of your caliber...
i'm only trying to...
i know what you are, i am <u>so</u> sorry that you...when i read that script i said there's only one person to play that part.
the minute i read that script i said...
i know...
...she works with <u>animals</u>, she...
...yes...
...she has a <u>home</u>...
...i know, i'm so...because i said: yes, a woman who...the...the community <u>respects</u> her.  please don't go.  please don't go.  what can i do but beseech you...?  trauma, <u>toil</u>...when are we free of them...?  when...?
he treated me as if i were a child...
claire:  as an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  stay with me.  i need you.  we start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  stay.  stay.  tonight...when...  when they've gone.  let's talk.  let's <u>really</u> talk.  we could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
i'm sorry walt -- it's gone beyond that.
well, i've enjoyed it, too.  any... any...<u>any</u> time...  what does the woman want from life...?
she wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
pay her off.
we don't have the money.
<u>find</u> it.
if you do the product placement...
it's a computer comany...it's a computer company, <u>bazoomer</u>-<u>com</u>?
"bazoomer <u>dot</u> com."
i can't put a computer in a movie shot in 1895...you wanna tell me how i'm gonna' do that?
actually, the art department had some ideas on...
no no no no no, pay her off.  did you hear me?
gimme howie gold.  howie?  thizz...i neee...i need eight hundred grand.  i...i don't care where it comes from...  it comes out of our end.  i...i need...just get me the money. i...just get me the goddamn money...look:
she doesn't show her tits!!!  she doesn't show her tits.  the breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
the breasts symbolize motherhood...
the movie's about <u>purity</u>.  so we don't <u>show</u> her breasts.  we show them to <u>him</u>, her back to the camera.
...she keeps her back to the camera...?
it'll hurt the box office.
they know what her tits look like.
know?  they could draw them from memory. you're fantastic.  what a find you are. get outta here.  we need the dead horse scene.
i'm gonna nail it.
i know you are.  go you huskies.
we got the permit.
is that one hell of a kid?
he just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
he's got a gift for fiction.
we got to do something nice for <u>him</u>.

he's been playin' old farmer nigh on sixty years.
i read for that part.  did pretty good too.

...i have to give you this <u>ticket</u> for damage to city property.  i'm really sorry, sir, it's a formality, i hope you'll excuse...
you have to what?
it's a formality.  any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  they'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, i hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
well, officer, don't worry ab...
if there's anything i...
hello.
...he's right here, mr. mayor...
bob are you alright...?
hi.
hi.
where you going?
going home.
going home, yeah.  i told them what you said...
what?
i told them what you said about the script...
i didn't say anything special, i was just talking out loud.
...how <u>else</u> can you talk?
no, that's true.
no.  you, i told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  and, i don't know, the movies, i don't know.  they should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
yessuh.  joseph knights printshop. vacant for thirty years.

i'm so comfortable with that, walt, i can't <u>tell</u> you...
well, joe said it, and he's right.
and i have mr. barrenger's tuna b...
thank you.
i, well, you know, i tried to take him, in his room.
i think he's moved...

what is the...?
arrest him.
conspiracy in statutory rape?  okay.  of whom?
this young woman.
nobody touched me, i was at home.
who is it raped you?
nobody.
well, what's the beef?
she was in the car with bob barrenger last night.  and she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so...
you were in the car with bob?
no.
then what is the...?
it's a mistake.  it's all over.  i'm sorry that we've inconvenienced you.
i wasn't in the car.
we know that you weren't.
...upset and impressionable...  get me the mayor...
...i was just talking to that girl in the other room.
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
i never touched her.  my mother's gr...
and a <u>fantasy</u> object...
wally...?
look, carla.  this is a hard time for you.  many young people go to hollywood. i did...and we all dream of it, and here, here hollywood has come to you...
her...
i swear that that woman in my room...
mmm.
that we could use you in and i think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
here it is: statutory r...blah, blah, blah, blah..."statutory"..."unsupported testimony by the..."  hold on, bobby...  you've got nothing, and you know it.  by god, you know it.  harassment.  you need a...even if this was true, you need a witness.  you need someone puts her in the car, and you've got nothing.  now we all have...yes, give her that part in the film.  yes, we'd love to have you...now: we all have more important things to do, isn't that right...?
yes?  hello, mr. mayor.  nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  it's the mayor, he's saying...
is he cool or angry?
well, these things happen.  <u>purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> mr. barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...
so we just got lucky.
marty, it's howie gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
and i need a drink.
if your memory was as long as your dick, you'd be in good shape.  how long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
how could she turn on me like that?  i thought she liked me.
can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
i'm ready!
stay ready.  stay by yourself in your room.
what'll i do for fun?
whyn't you learn your lines?
i <u>know</u> my lines...

i just don't know what <u>order</u> they come in...
hey, you've gotta eat a peck of dirt...
my wife just went into labor...
half a buck i'd close it down...it's per...you know, it's perfidy, you got your barrenger, molesting little girls...

i signed the permit.  i don't know how i can.
i want them thrown in jail.
sherry, sherry...
good morning.
sleep well?
yeah, you?
oh yeah.
i've been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
yes...
we could live up here, live up in the country.
now you're talking...
...and we could get up every morning...
...well, we do that <u>anyway</u>...
and come to the printshop.  you know <u>why</u>...?
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
to print the newspaper.  and i'd come to <u>write</u>.  to write.  to write.  right here in the office.
not without a rolltop desk.
well, i could <u>get</u> a rolltop desk.
happen to know where there's one for sale.
well ain't you amazing.
lookit that, up already.
that's why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  both up with the chickens.
well you guess what.  the mayor sent me. i have your mr. barrenger with a history of...
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, i have the mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: i may own the studio when i get through with you: i got a civil suit, i got rape, i got collusion...
you've got nothing, you don't have a witness...
and i've got a witness!  your mr. white saw the crime.
he told you that...
he didn't have to tell...
i want to talk to him.  would you ex...
oh, you're his attorney, too...?
later for you, pal.
okay...
bobby, don't say anything.
nothing happened.
what is it all about?
i saw...
how do they know that, you told them?
no.
what did you say to them...?
i didn't say anything to them.
how do you know you saw it?
i don't know.
well, then, you didn't see it, right...?
i don't...
you didn't see it...
i...?  i saw it.  i was there.
you were there.  at...at 10:35...?
i was walking down the street...i remember, i was writing a...
what glasses were you wearing?  were you wearing your reading glasses...?
i...
you told me you were writing.  don't you wear your reading glasses to write...?
what am i gonna do?
you got to tell em that you saw the accident.  don't you?
i can't do that.  if i tell them, they'll, if i <u>tell</u> them, they'll try bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
but that's what happened.
but it'll stop the movie.
maybe they'll be <u>other</u> movies.
they'll...they'll <u>blackball</u> me...
carla was in the car, right?
i...i <u>think</u> that's right...
...you think that's right...
let's speak english.  you've got to help the side.
you want me to lie.
to the contrary.  i want you to tell the truth.  the truth is, you can't tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing.  you don't remember, a gun to your head, which glasses you have on.  and you have a fertile imagination.  imagination wants to fill in the blanks.  now.  if you aren't <u>sure</u>, then they have nothing.  bob walks free.  as he should.  joe:  wasn't long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart.  you know?  the people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them, we fear them. and they fear us.  because we tell the truth.  about our lives.  now, this is a damn roust, and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case, he wants to make a name for himself.  if we let him do that, if we let him do that, then we're being false to our community...to our community, you understand...?  to our world.  cause you are a part of that world, now.  you have to take off the steel rolex and put on the gold rolex.  and be part of your world.  i got a five picture deal with the studio.  and you stick with me.  you write one, two more, you stick with me, and you'll <u>direct</u> the third one.  you are a part of this world. it's in your blood.  it's you.  you have to do the right thing:  we're out in the provinces, the sheriff, <u>literally</u> is at our door.  you have to stand with the troops, joe.  that's the bottom line. you <u>have</u> to...if you had the leisure to think it through, you'd see it for yourself.  the girl wasn't in the car.
where you off to?
i, uh...i'm leaving.
why?
i perjured myself.  i told a lie, and i ruined my life. that's what i did...  i don't suppose you could help me with <u>that</u>, could you?  turn back the <u>clock</u>, or something?  give me back my, give me back my <u>purity</u>, i don't suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  but what <u>is</u> truth? eh?  in't that the thing?  what <u>is</u> true?
it's the truth that you should never trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  cravat's sposed to point down to accentuate the <u>genitals</u>, why'd you wanna trust somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate his <u>ears</u>...?
aren't you supposed to set an example for people...?
nope.  i'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  what'd you say your problem was...
...i just swore my life away, back in that...
mornin, chessy...how's the back...?
what courthouse?
courthouse back in town.
town ain't got no courthouse.
what?
ain't got no courthouse.  courthouse burnt down, 1960.
well, where do they hold court?
hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.
what are you going to do?
i'm going to tell the truth.
do something.
you tell me what to do, i'll do it.
thank god, it's up to you, pal.  sup to you...
i'm out.
i don't getcha.
the girl was in the car.
i treated you like a son or nephew.
it's not <u>you</u>, it's...
no, what is it?
i have to tell the truth.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
the girl was in the car.
then you're finished in show business.
so be it.
and my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
for what cause?
i don't need a cause, just a lawyer.
hi.
i'd prefer it if you didn't speak to me.
i...
...you know, there's nothing you could say, that could <u>possibly</u> make a difference, so, why don't you just save your breath.
what's in the case?
eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
and what was it you wanted to say?
gut yuntif.
i'll wait for you...i'm proud of you. i'll <u>be</u> waiting.
if i go to jail...?
i'll knit you a sweater.
mornin, sister.
we missed you in church today, frank.
sister, i've just come from a <u>fire</u>...
mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.
i'll be there.

he'll eat potroast and like it.
