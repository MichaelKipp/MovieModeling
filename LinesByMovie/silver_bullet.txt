you always take his side because he's a cripple! well, it's not my fault that he's a cripple!
come on, jane- it was brady's idea. i couldn't stop him.
brady's a booger and so are you!
did he really get his head cut off, dad? that's what brady said.
if you don't stop it i'm going to vomit. i mean it.
what's the money for?
a new pair of panty hose. is it enough?
i don't want your money. you're a booger.
it was brady's idea, jane. honest to god. please take the money. i want to make up.
you booger.
that's what my sister says, too. pretty soon i'm going to start checking the mirror to see if i'm turning green.
not bad, huh? my uncle al took off the regular muffler and put on a cherry bomb.
what's that?
glasspack. he said he'd come over sometime this summer and we'd soup up the engine... but now i dunno. he's getting a divorce and he's in the doghouse with my mother.
for getting a divorce?
well... it is his third.
i used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did i! i mean i know how stupid that sounds, but...
hey, take it easy. i know how you feel.
there's something else scary.
what?
i've been hearing noises in there.
what kind of noises?
rattling. rustling.
rats...
and my dad says it's kids. but it's not rats and it's not kids. it's-
well, it's probably nothing. i'm just spooked since... you know.
yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. okay?
okay. have you got enough gas to get home, marty?
ralph houk! you can't bet a manager! stone the crows!
okay, okay. dwight evans.
piss on him. piss on all the red sox.
mom-!
let the boy finish the game, nan.
i come here because marty needs a friend.
yes... you've always been that to him. but if you can't leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
mom was really mad at him this time, wasn't she?
what do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
stop it!
yes. go away.
let me help you up.
you all right, marty?
yeah.
there's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. you ever hear that one?
no.
well, i'm not sure that was. christ! they better get the guy.
uncle al, what if it's not a guy?
huh?
what if it's some kind of monster?
what's going on at owen's, uncle al?
a bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're clint eastwood... marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
it isn't enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed brady. now he's got them to cancel the fair.
and the fireworks. hand me that box, marty.
yeah, okay, the fireworks. jane thinks that's all i'm mad about, but it's not. them doing that is just a... a...
it's just an outward symbol of everything that's inwardly wrong in this town. not bad, huh? i read sherwood anderson in college. i can jive that shit all day.
well... i like it that you always know how to say things, uncle al.
i'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
don't call me dear boy.
but you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
your mom's not around, is she?
she and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. jane's walking around like she's king shit of turd mountain. like always.
uh-huh. only in her case i guess it would be queen shit of turd mountain. hand me that adjustable.
yeah, winesburg, ohio, was never like that... but i got something that just might cheer you up.
what?
wait, dear boy. just wait. hand me those pliars.
you got a pilot's license, marty?
do i need one?
we're gonna find out. take it down the road a ways and back. be careful.
you gave me a heart attack, marty. i'm dying. i hope you're happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
it really goes fast. thanks, uncle al.
it goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, marty, i will have a new job. singing soprano with the vienna boys' choir.
i don't get you.
i know you don't. but i want this to be our secret. you get that, don't you?
sure.
good.
so have i, actually... i wish it could always be like this.
see me around to my car, marty, and make sure i stay out of trouble at least that long.
now i said i had something for you, as i believe you will recall.
yeah! what is it?
stay near the house, for christ's sake- someone's killing people. i have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
yeah, i know. it's great!
one of the reasons i love you, marty, is that you're almost as crazy as i am. please don't set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? just bright colors. can you tell the difference?
yeah... sure.
save this one for last.
what is it?
a tracer. you'll like it.
thanks a million, uncle al!
you're welcome a million, marty. stick 'em in the bushes for now.
marty? you okay? you've just been sitting here all morning.
where's mom?
went shopping. why?
jane, i have to talk to you.
holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-jesus-christ!
uncle al-
it came for me! i shot it in the eye! now he's wearing an eye-patch!
i called peltzer on my way over here, marty! father lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. that's a fancy way of saying eyewash. he's got a corneal inflammation.
was it a prescription?
what the hell does that matter?
it wasn't- i'll bet you it wasn't. because to get a prescription he'd have to see a doctor.
marty, marty, you should hear yourself!
well... was it a prescription?
i don't know. but i know you didn't see any werewolf the other night, marty. you had a dream, that's all. an extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what's been happening in this town.
what about the baseball bat jane saw in his shed? you know who used to have a baseball bat like that? mr. knopfler! he was so proud of it he used to carry it in the fourth of july parade! jane said it looked like the green giant used it for a toothpick!
you want to know what i think?
no- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
watch it, dear boy. i think it was a hallucination. probably a broomstick, or something.
if father lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called constable haller to tell him marty's sending poison-pen letters?
i don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, jane. because i don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw marty in his wheelchair.
why hasn't he picked up the phone and told constable haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters?
i'll bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. and i'll bet you another quarter he hasn't said anything to mr. haller.
marty, do you see your suspect?
do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? he'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
i didn't shoot him when he was a man. i shot him when he was-
when he was a werewolf. yes. right. jesus. jane, you don't really believe this madness, do you?
well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. also, i checked on the otic solution. it was counter brand. no prescription needed.
i told you!
shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
after marty called me with his latest thrilling tale of wonder, i did.  he's had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
i told you!
no... but i found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
there! you see!
it could have been anything, marty.
what about father lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? you don't think that was a dream, do you?
no.
lowe's car-?
blue. this blue.
jesus.
mr. haller said he'd check him out, and guess what? no one sees him again!
and what do you suggest i do about it, dear boy?
i want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
you're not going to let it go, are you?
i saw what i saw.
marty, the moon wasn't even full!
jane... you don't have to do that.
don't tell me what i have to do and what i don't, booger-brains.
will you marry me, jane?
would you kids mind telling me how this guy lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
i don't know. maybe he doesn't know, either.
no one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
the kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a jesuit. a french jesuit.
i think he's going to come for me. not just because i know who he is, but because i hurt him. only i don't think he'll try again as lowe.
dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
will you do it?
please, uncle al.
will you?
remember, al... we'll be at the ritz-carlton in boston tomorrow night! or at the funeral parlor. it's stickney and-
-and babcock, i remember. now go on!
and don't open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
we won't!
you kids go to bed on time! you've got school tomorrow!
if you keep doing that, you're going to bump your head, sissy. give my love to mama- tell her i'll see her thursday.
i will- be good, kids.
can i tell you kids something?
sure, uncle al.
when me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
yeah? really?
yeah. really. the bitch of it is, we still are. learn from your elders, dearies.
i suppose so. you kids ought to go up to bed.
but uncle al! you said-
i know what i said, marty- but it's ten past one. he's not coming.
the moon's not down yet...
damn near. now i'll sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because i promised, but you two are going to bed. go on, now, scoot.
what if i say no?
then i'd have to kick your ass, dear boy.  go on, now.
don't you touch me, snotbrains!
jane-
are you all right, marty?
all except my legs... i don't think i can walk.
you're a real booger, you know it?
