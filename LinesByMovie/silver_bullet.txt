you always take his side because he is a cripple! well, it is not my fault that he is a cripple!
come on, jane- it was brady's idea. i could not stop him.
brady's a booger and so are you!
did he really get his head cut off, dad? that is what brady said.
if you do not stop it I am going to vomit. i mean it.
what is the money for?
a new pair of panty hose. is it enough?
i do not want your money. you are a booger.
it was brady's idea, jane. honest to god. please take the money. i want to make up.
you booger.
that is what my sister says, too. pretty soon I am going to start checking the mirror to see if I am turning green.
not bad, huh? my uncle al took off the regular muffler and put on a cherry bomb.
what is that?
glasspack. he said he would come over sometime this summer and we would soup up the engine... but now i dunno. he is getting a divorce and he is in the doghouse with my mother.
for getting a divorce?
well... it is his third.
i used to see her every day, and she never knew what was going to happen to her, and neither did i! i mean i know how stupid that sounds, but...
hey, take it easy. i know how you feel.
there is something else scary.
what?
I have been hearing noises in there.
what kind of noises?
rattling. rustling.
rats...
and my dad says it is kids. but it is not rats and it is not kids. it's-
well, it is probably nothing. I am just spooked since... you know.
yeah... but if you hear any more noises, tell your father. okay?
okay. have you got enough gas to get home, marty?
ralph houk! you can not bet a manager! stone the crows!
okay, okay. dwight evans.
piss on him. piss on all the red sox.
mom-!
let the boy finish the game, nan.
i come here because marty needs a friend.
yes... you have always been that to him. but if you can not leave your booze in whatever dump you call home, you better just stay away.
mom was really mad at him this time, was not she?
what do you expect, when he comes in smelling like a brewery and looking like an unmade bed?
stop it!
yes. go away.
let me help you up.
you all right, marty?
yeah.
there is a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. you ever hear that one?
no.
well, I am not sure that was. christ! they better get the guy.
uncle al, what if it is not a guy?
huh?
what if it is some kind of monster?
what is going on at owen's, uncle al?
a bunch of men getting ready to pretend they are clint eastwood... marty, did not anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
it is not enough that the monster killed all those people- that he killed brady. now he is got them to cancel the fair.
and the fireworks. hand me that box, marty.
yeah, okay, the fireworks. jane thinks that is all I am mad about, but it is not. them doing that is just a... a...
it is just an outward symbol of everything that is inwardly wrong in this town. not bad, huh? i read sherwood anderson in college. i can jive that shit all day.
well... i like it that you always know how to say things, uncle al.
I will give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they will be interested to hear that.
do not call me dear boy.
but you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
your mom's not around, is she?
she and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. jane's walking around like she is king shit of turd mountain. like always.
uh-huh. only in her case i guess it would be queen shit of turd mountain. hand me that adjustable.
yeah, winesburg, ohio, was never like that... but i got something that just might cheer you up.
what?
wait, dear boy. just wait. hand me those pliars.
you got a pilot's license, marty?
do i need one?
we are going to find out. take it down the road a ways and back. be careful.
you gave me a heart attack, marty. I am dying. i hope you are happy, because you are looking at a dying man.
it really goes fast. thanks, uncle al.
it goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, marty, i will have a new job. singing soprano with the vienna boys' choir.
i do not get you.
i know you don't. but i want this to be our secret. you get that, do not you?
sure.
good.
so have i, actually... i wish it could always be like this.
see me around to my car, marty, and make sure i stay out of trouble at least that long.
now i said i had something for you, as i believe you will recall.
yeah! what is it?
stay near the house, for christ's sake- someone is killing people. i have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
yeah, i know. it is great!
one of the reasons i love you, marty, is that you are almost as crazy as i am. please do not set off anything that goes bang tonight, okay? just bright colors. can you tell the difference?
yeah... sure.
save this one for last.
what is it?
a tracer. you will like it.
thanks a million, uncle al!
you are welcome a million, marty. stick 'em in the bushes for now.
marty? you okay? you have just been sitting here all morning.
where is mom?
went shopping. why?
jane, i have to talk to you.
holy-jumped-up-baldheaded-jesus-christ!
uncle al-
it came for me! i shot it in the eye! now he is wearing an eye-patch!
i called peltzer on my way over here, marty! father lowe came into the drugstore two days ago for a bottle of otic solution. that is a fancy way of saying eyewash. he is got a corneal inflammation.
was it a prescription?
what the hell does that matter?
it wasn't- I will bet you it wasn't. because to get a prescription he would have to see a doctor.
marty, marty, you should hear yourself!
well... was it a prescription?
i do not know. but i know you did not see any werewolf the other night, marty. you had a dream, that is all. an extremely realistic nightmare brought on by what is been happening in this town.
what about the baseball bat jane saw in his shed? you know who used to have a baseball bat like that? mr. knopfler! he was so proud of it he used to carry it in the fourth of july parade! jane said it looked like the green giant used it for a toothpick!
you want to know what i think?
no- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
watch it, dear boy. i think it was a hallucination. probably a broomstick, or something.
if father lowe is an innocent little lamb, why has not he picked up the telephone and called constable haller to tell him marty's sending poison-pen letters?
i do not accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, jane. because i do not accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw marty in his wheelchair.
why has not he picked up the phone and told constable haller that someone is sending him poison-pen letters?
I will bet you a quarter that eyewash stuff was nonprescription. and I will bet you another quarter he has not said anything to mr. haller.
marty, do you see your suspect?
do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? he would either be in the hospital... or dead.
i did not shoot him when he was a man. i shot him when he was-
when he was a werewolf. yes. right. jesus. jane, you do not really believe this madness, do you?
well... it is a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. also, i checked on the otic solution. it was counter brand. no prescription needed.
i told you!
shut up, dear boy- no gloating allowed.
after marty called me with his latest thrilling tale of wonder, i did.  he is had no poison-pen complaints lodged at all.
i told you!
no... but i found some blood, smeared on a tree trunk in that grove.
there! you see!
it could have been anything, marty.
what about father lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? you do not think that was a dream, do you?
no.
lowe's car-?
blue. this blue.
jesus.
mr. haller said he would check him out, and guess what? no one sees him again!
and what do you suggest i do about it, dear boy?
i want you to turn this into a silver bullet.
you are not going to let it go, are you?
i saw what i saw.
marty, the moon was not even full!
jane... you do not have to do that.
do not tell me what i have to do and what i don't, booger-brains.
will you marry me, jane?
would you kids mind telling me how this guy lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
i do not know. maybe he does not know, either.
no one knows how cancer begins, either- or exactly what it is- but people still believe in it.
the kid is eleven years old and already he sounds like a jesuit. a french jesuit.
i think he is going to come for me. not just because i know who he is, but because i hurt him. only i do not think he will try again as lowe.
dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
will you do it?
please, uncle al.
will you?
remember, al... we will be at the ritz-carlton in boston tomorrow night! or at the funeral parlor. it is stickney and-
-and babcock, i remember. now go on!
and do not open the door for any trick or treaters even if they come!
we won't!
you kids go to bed on time! you have got school tomorrow!
if you keep doing that, you are going to bump your head, sissy. give my love to mama- tell her I will see her thursday.
i will- be good, kids.
can i tell you kids something?
sure, uncle al.
when me and sissy were kids, we were just like you two.
yeah? really?
yeah. really. the bitch of it is, we still are. learn from your elders, dearies.
i suppose so. you kids ought to go up to bed.
but uncle al! you said-
i know what i said, marty- but it is ten past one. he is not coming.
the moon's not down yet...
damn near. now I will sit up with this stupid gun in my lap because i promised, but you two are going to bed. go on, now, scoot.
what if i say no?
then I would have to kick your ass, dear boy.  go on, now.
do not you touch me, snotbrains!
jane-
are you all right, marty?
all except my legs... i do not think i can walk.
you are a real booger, you know it?
