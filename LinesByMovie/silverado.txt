two of the horses ran off, but that pinto you are riding hung around.
you got no idea what they were after?
offend anybody lately?
not for five years.
jefferson city?
no, leavenworth.
I have never been in there. they just jumped you out of the blue?
i had to get up anyway.
me, I am riding along, minding my own business. four cowboys come by and we decide to ride together for a while, friendly as can be. i always figure you might as well approach life like everybody's your friend or nobody is... do not make much difference. we get out in the middle of that frying pan and suddenly everybody's pointing their gun but me. i guess they admired my horse. she is a great one, a sweet little bay.
looks like that is not all they admired.
yup. the whole rig. i do not care much about the rest, but i surely will miss that bay. least they did not kill me. that was right considerate, i thought. they were laughing when they left me. thought it was real funny. i walked for a little while but there was no use, so i gave it up. figured it was just bad luck.
looks like those boys are headed south, so they were not the same ones that jumped me. which way you going?
where is the pinto going?
i gotta stop by turley and meet a guy.
where is turley?
south of here, past chimayo.
maybe I will go along as far as chimayo. get me some clothes. maybe a bath.
yeah, maybe a bath.
hello, cobb.
hello, paden. how ya doing?
i see you are prospering without me.
it is been a while.
where is the dog?
appreciate the loan. I am good for it.
let's talk about that.  I am looking for some men.
I have given that up.
so have i. I have got a legitimate job now. i can use a guy like you.
you have got a legitimate job.
yes, sir. you would not believe it.
you are right.
this is mighty sweet, paden. i think i finally found my place in the world.
well I am real happy for you, cobb. but i think I will keep looking for mine.
i see what you like, she is mighty pretty.
and bridle-wise, too. she is the only thing i lost i really cared about.  'cept for maybe my hat. it is a great one. got a pretty silver band on it. my head spent three years training it.  i surely do miss that hat.
i gotta be going.
going to turley, was it?
gotta meet a guy and head out for silverado.
what is turley like?
it is a town...
they got a saloon there?
i expect.
women?
i expect.
I have got my people sitting down there...  ...swatting flies and raring to go.
I am afraid it is a bad start, friend, 'cause my name is not baxter, and he am not hawley.
you are not baxter?
my name is emmett.
and you are not baxter, either?
does not look quite fair.
which way do you mean?
what is all this then?
this nigger's breaking up my place, sheriff langston.
i do not like that word much, carter.
we do not serve them here and you know it. i asked him to leave and he went crazy on us. he owes me money for this damage.
is that a fact?
there are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing are not them.  are these your friends?
i wanted a drink and a bed. i guess i came to the wrong place.
came to the wrong town. i do not tolerate this kind of thing. it is hard on the peace, and it is hard on the furniture. now, knowing a bit about carter here, I am going to let you go without paying for the damages. but go you will, and i mean now.
is there a place in town that takes... my kind?
you misunderstand. i want you out of town. in fact, i want you all the way out of my jurisdiction.
that am not right.
i decide what is right in this jurisdiction. now move.
who is going to pay for all this, sheriff?
do not press your luck, carter.
now let's talk about you chaps.
we would rather stay.
we will see about that. I am sheriff john langston. as you may have guessed, i am not from these parts.
you are kidding.
but the good citizens of turley have taken me in their embrace, and for one simple reason. i maintain the peace. so when strangers come to town, i always ask them their business. have you come for the hanging?
I am just meeting a guy here and moving on. so far i have not been able to find him.
in my town, when you are looking for someone, you ask me.
all right. I am looking for a young fella, full of juice. about my size, wears a fancy two-gun rig.
emmett! am i glad to see you!
howdy, jake. what is going on here?
you got me. this is a crazy town, emmett. i think we ought to get out of here.
all i did was kiss a girl.
that is why they got you in jail?
yeah, i kissed a girl and this guy did not like it and we had some words, so i decided to get out of there.
so i did, i got out of there, i do not want no trouble. you know me.  so i walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back.
...and you had to kill him?
no, no, no! i winged him, and he dropped his gun.
you are in here for winging a guy?
well, no, not exactly. see then his friend opened up on me.
what friend is that?
the one with the shotgun.
jake, I am going to ask you once -- was it self-defense?
honest to god, emmett, he would have killed me.
the jury saw it differently.
so this is the guy you are going to hang?
tomorrow morning. ten o'clock.
i was afraid of that.
i guess tomorrow at dawn he will be proved right.
ten a.m.
right... i thought they always did it at dawn.  so long, kid. I am sorry.
shame about the kid. seems a lively sort.
he is that.
i hate to see any man swing. bad luck.
bad luck for me. now i gotta bust him out of there.
you will have to deal me out on that. I have had some experience with that sort of thing, and i do not want any more.
i understand.
it is not going to be easy.
it never is. but he is my brother.  we are going to california together. but first we are going to stop in silverado and see our sister. and i can not show up there with a story like this.
then i guess this is where we part ways. sorry.
no hard feelings.
c'mon, I will buy you a drink.
you have not got any money.
all right, you buy me a drink.
maybe i ought to throw you in jail too. then you could be with all your friends.
i have not done anything.
i want you out of town before the hanging.
I will be long gone.
you mean you am not coming with emmett and me?
i can not say I am convinced you are going anywhere.
sure we are. we are leaving at dawn.
I have got no reason to run. it was a fair fight and there were plenty of witnesses.
yeah, that is what happened with me too.
the other guy drew first.
right!
did not he tell you about blind pete?
we did not get that far.
blind pete taught me a great trick.
that is the longest i ever did it. 'bout bust a gut.
what now?
we wait.
where is your brother?
he will be here.
i think we lost 'em.
there is nobody coming?
this a friend of yours?
he is now.
who is he?
oh, a guy who got run out of town...
hobart, what are you people doing here?
this is where baxter and hawley brung us.
well, they are wrong. this territory is full of bad characters.
and they were two of them. look --
forget the money. you have got to get these people out of here. this is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
your next water am not for three days.
you know, hanging around with you is no picnic.
anybody got any ideas?
i would not do that. you are going to need every gun when that posse gets here.
posse? what the hell you talking about?
my partner and me robbed the bank in turley and headed out with a posse on our tails. my partner there caught one a ways back, and i think he kicked off while i was looking for this damn canyon. you are dawson, am not you? I am tex larue.  used to ride with ry morris. you know him. well, andy sims told me there was a hideout here, so i headed for it. hope you do not mind.
you brought a posse to my best hideout and you want to know if i mind. mister, i do not know any of those names and you are about to die.
wait a minute! if you do not believe me, ask them...  ...they saw me and my pal in turley before we did the job.
I would get down if i were you. they may be up there now.
no money, eh?
the money's in my saddlebags over there, but i am not stepping out to get it.
if we charge them, they will not have a chance. but we got to get to the horses.
what do you mean, the horses?
after the war my family worked a little piece of land near savannah for a while. but the way it was down there then... well, they made it hard every way they could. finally my daddy figured the promised land was out this direction. by that time i was so sick of farming, i did not want to touch another hoe ever. i would not come with 'em. my daddy took it pretty hard. him, my ma, and my little sister headed out without me. they have got a little place south of silverado. i guess they have done okay. good enough anyway so that when my ma wrote me last time, she said they needed my help to work the place. that was almost nine months ago she wrote. letter took a while to find me, but when it did, it was just the right time.
where were you?
chicago. working in the slaughter- houses.
where you been?
oh, i was just checking the, ah...  ...you know, lookin' in.
he acted bravely out there, hannah. just bad luck his getting hit. could have been any one of us.
i do not believe in luck. i know what conrad was like. do not tell me what you think i want to hear.
never will again.
we got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. it is hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
more than enough.
have you thought at all about your plans?
some. I have been talking to the parkers. one thing i know I am not doing -- I am not going back.
this is it, gents. my ma told me to head south past that rock.
good luck, mal.
maybe we will see you sometime.
yeah... maybe. so long.
i think I will ride along with the lady here. just take a look at this farmland before i come into silverado. see what makes a trip this hard worth taking.  I will see you around.
I will be around.
mr. and mrs. parker have agreed to join their parcel to mine. we will work them together.  mine starts right over there. it is all I have ever wanted. pretty land, is not it?
and a pretty lady.
a lot of men have told me that. maybe it is true. i guess some women are slow to believe it.
believe it.
they are drawn to me by that. but it never lasts.
why?
because they do not like what i want.
what is that?
i want to build something, make things grow. that takes hard work -- a lifetime of it. that is not why men come to a pretty woman.
daddy?
i saw the light. i thought maybe rae had come back to see me. but i never thought it would be my boy. i never thought that.
where is rae?
she is gone, gone to town. she hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
what happened?
they run me off. they burned me out. they made it so i could not do. just like georgia. if you will not sell, they take it anyway.
who?
the cattle! this valley runs down to a clear creek. that is why we picked this spot, and that is why they do not want us here.
you own this land.
i paid the government for it, all right. that do not mean much out here.  malachi, I am living like a wildcat in a cave in those hills. hiding out, afraid to walk my own land.
what about the law?
whose law? the law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
j.t.'s done everything he can. i married a brave man. augie, take that delightful gift your uncle gave you out of here while we are talking.  mckendrick picked the new sheriff himself, so j.t. can not even get the law enforced.
half the gunslingers that drift into town turn up on our police force.
augie's going to grow up here. there is nothing wrong with the land, it is just some of the people.
the problem is, emmett, you killed the wrong mckendrick.
why, j.t., watch what you are saying around augie. emmett did not kill anybody.
well, kate, it was self-defense sure enough, but i think you would have to say i killed old murdo. i think that is definitely the word.
it was my fault.
it was not -- it was murdo's. those mckendricks do not know how to act like human beings.
his son is worse than he was. he is smoother, so you do not always hear him coming, but he will do anything to keep his range free.
I am worried what he is going to do when he finds out you boys are back.
that is a lie.
tomorrow we are going to town to straighten that out once and for all. the next day we will be back here... farming. and these cattle better be gone.
you work here?
i run the place. what can i get you?
nifty.
the world is what you make of it, friend. if it does not fit, you make alterations.
I will drink to that. will you join me, miss --
stella.
paden.
stella... are you the midnight star herself?
i am. I am always there, but i only shine at night.
my compliments to you, miss stella. this is what i call a saloon.
thanks. that is what i call it too.
and i know what I am talking about.
you like a good saloon?
it is the only place I am happy.
me too. what is wrong with us?
you would not be needing any help around here, would you? maybe with the gambling?
you see that fellow over there in the gray coat?
that is kelly, my so-called partner. he runs that side.
so-called?
yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he is just the man i would have picked.
why did you go into business with him?
i do not own this place. the man who does stuck me with kelly.
who is the owner?
here he comes right now.
stella, this is one of my oldest surviving friends. treat him right.
that was my plan.
oh, yeah, you two are going to get along fine. you got a lot in common.
kelly, get over here.  you did not come all this way just to pay me back that money, did you?  kelly, meet my friend paden.
howdy.
give the man a line of credit. he already owes the house thirteen bucks.
you got a place to stay?
i just got to town.
stella, we still got an extra room out back, do not we?
what brings you into my saloon?
luck, i guess.
good old paden. i was hoping you would changed your mind about the job.
you did not tell me you owned a saloon.
hannah's a smart, pretty woman, but she is got a hard idea for living.
yeah?
all I am saying is, you will not trip over me if you look her up.
I am going to california with my brother.
cobb, i want you to meet emmett. he is a friend of mine.  this is sheriff cobb.
pleased to meet you, sheriff.
you wanted to see me?
we are going to make some adjustments. i wanted you to be here when i offered paden your job. i think he could do it without getting greedy. stella and i are tired of you skimming our profits.
what are you talking about?
I am done talking. get out.
you can not do this.
really?
nothing like that will happen between us.
maybe we ought to ask stella.
is this a fair mix?
I am saving lives here. the straight stuff would raise a blood blister on boot leather.
i meant, seemed like a lot of whiskey.
what is this?
that is the good stuff.
oh, yeah? how good?
get out of here, jake.
all i did was kiss the girl.
that is what you said in turley. you remember how that ended.
what is the matter, paden? you afraid i could not get those two behind me?
i do not want you getting anyone in my place.
you really are a gambler.
give me some of the good stuff.
hello, rae.
what are you doing here? i thought you were done with our family.
daddy's dead.
he was murdered.
who did it?
I am not sure, but i got an idea. and when i am sure, they are going to pay.
oh that is just fine. where were you when ma and daddy needed you? it is too late, mal. now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
what are you doing here, rae? this am not for you.
it is none of your business.
rae, all we got is each other.
i do not have any family any more.
the parkers seem like nice folks.
they have been kind to me.
paden sends his best.
i guess i put a good scare into him.
I am surprised to see you out here tonight.
i just came out to say goodbye.
goodbye?
yeah, me and jake will be heading out for california soon.
you came all the way out here to tell me you are going to california? all you had to do was go, and we would never see each other again.
that is why I am here.
you do not make it easy on a fellow.
did not paden tell you that?
maybe you thought you would be back this way someday.
yeah... that must have been it.
emmett.
mckendrick.
i did not know you were out.
did it seem short to you?
that is all over as far as I am concerned, emmett. I am satisfied.
sounds good.
all right then.  let's go.
forget it.
wait a minute. get down off of there, augie.
are you all right?
this is a brutal land.
you must have known that before you came.
it is one thing to know it...
we told sheriff cobb about the attack.  he said he'd... look into it.  i can not believe he is the law out here. now i see why you all wear guns.
how is mr. parker doing?
just like you would think. but he is not going to run. we are sticking to our plan. now we both need help.
he must be pretty good.
he is good, all right. too good for my men. that is why you have got to take care of it.
what about his brother?
we will handle that. he is careless.
things are getting messy around here.  i hear ezra johnson got himself killed.
i heard that too.
did you hear his son is still around?
it is an advance. we want him to know he is going to be happy here.
i would not worry about that.
i thought you two would get along.
from what I have seen, paden does not care much about money.
he says he does not care about anything, but he does. there is just no telling what it is going to be.
where is the dog now?
he left me.
i took out thirteen dollars.
this is a lot of money.
i told you this was a sweet set-up.
it is that.
maybe you could run it without stella.
easy, boy. just an idea.
well, thanks, but forget it.
you know, paden, what makes all this work is me doing my job. the fellows you came to town with are causing some trouble. it is going to take a little straightening out. i have my responsibilities. i want you to understand. it has nothing to do with us.
what is it you want from me?
nothing. do nothing. do not get between us.
I am a great believer in doing nothing.
so we understand each other?
do not worry about me. if you are taking on emmett, the last place i want to be is between you.
...gotta go...
sure.
where are we?
someplace safe. how you feeling?
I would be worse if you had not come along.
i did not just come along. i was looking for you.  jake said you were out there. i saw him in town, and he told me about that business the other night. said you boys took a henry off one of mckendrick's men. i wanted to see it.
that is it.
this was my father's. the men who killed him took it.
I am sorry.
i got to get to my brother. if they came after me, they will want him too.
you will never make it.
have to.
I will go. I will bring jake out here.
be careful. you are in it now. and it is going to get mean.
so far that is all i seen in this life.
get out. we have nothing to talk about.
rae, i need help.
why come to me?
because you are my sister. there is nobody else.  the men who killed daddy are after jake. i got to talk to him.
what is stopping you?
they are watching the hollis place. i can not get through.
what makes you think i could?
why would they stop you?
because I am your sister.
why him?
shut up. you need help, do not you?
why are they doing this, mal?
because they enjoy it.
i heard from stella you were trying to find jake. what happened to emmett?
you do not know?
i got there just short of too late.
lucky.
yeah, it is working out real good.
where is emmett now?
I am going to have to look into this.
yeah, maybe i will too.
i thought we talked about that.
we did not talk about this.  they took the little boy, cobb.
you gotta calm down, paden. everything will be put straight in a few days.
i saw how you are putting mal johnson straight.
i never could count on you to be reasonable.  do not force me to make an adjustment around here.
cobb, you have got nothing i need.
I am not thinking about your future, paden. I am worried about stella.
what is she got to do with it?
not a thing. she is just a mutual friend.  but if you wind up on the wrong side of this, she is going to get hurt.
what is it that i can not figure?
what do you mean?
cobb's got something on you, and it must be pretty good.
what makes you say that?
if he did not you would never sit still while this was happening.
you sure? maybe that is the kind of friend i am.
nah!  what is he got? this is a nice saloon, but there are other nice saloons. it is not the money. not for you. why can not i get ahold of it?  cobb says there is no telling what you are going to care about.
is that what he said? well, he figured it okay this time.
some people think because they are stronger -- or meaner -- they can push you around. I have seen a lot of that. but it is only true if you let it be. the world is what you make of it.
i like your attitude. but it can be risky.
I am ready for that.
how about you?
i do not want you to get hurt.
he can not hurt me if he is dead.
I have got a place i can hide her.
you better get in there with her until this thing is over.
i almost didn't.
where is jake?
mckendrick's men got him.
is he alive?
kate?
she was hurt... pretty bad.  emmett, they took the little boy with them.
new record.
let's get out of here.
I will see you around.
last one to the midnight star buys.
what a waste. this could have been such a sweet deal for us.
yeah. bad luck.  good-bye, cobb.
good-bye, paden.
gotta go.
right.
were not you going to come out to say good-bye?
i already did that.
this time you are really going?  you know where I will be.
that i do.
you might make a farmer yet.
I have got a job.
