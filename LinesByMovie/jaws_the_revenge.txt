stop that....
stop what?
that....
I am not doing anything.
that hurt....
serves you right.  will you please stop....
can not help myself....
i see what you are doing....
I am hungry, mom....
let me finish dinner before you eat it...chop the peppers....
are you all right?
adds flavor....
we do not want any....
hello?  thea who?  i know it is thea brody.  how many grandchildren do i have?  i know you can use the phone by yourself. you are a big girl.  i know you are five.
the fish.  check it....
you check it....
I am on the phone....
in a minute....
what is going on?
ask the big doctor about his work.  tough life you bahamian beach bum... playing in the water all day....
he heard that.
good.
a big one....
a small one...your brother will not be here....
do not be late.
i won't....
that bad, huh?
we are out of decaf...we're out of petty cash...and we are out of requisition forms....
you have the safety talk at school, one of the clock tomorrow....
anything to do before i go home?
that man keeps calling about his training film.  i can not convince him we do not have a s.w.a.t. team.
good night, polly....
where is lenny?
gone to ben masters' place.  cow tipping.
cow tipping?
claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  they are not giving milk.
I will take care of it.
deputy brody will take care of it personally.
it came for him.  it waited all this time and it came for him....
mother....
i bought him his first legal drink. he got so pissed that night....
he told me you both did....
sit down, ma....
you guys must be starving....
i want you to get out of the water....
what?
i want you to give up that terrible job.
come on, mom, you can not be serious....
you are damn right I am serious....
I am just getting started....
i do not want you in the water anymore....
mom, you are upset.  sit down...please....
i will not have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  never again...never....
hey, come on, you can not believe that voodoo.  sharks do not commit murder. they do not pick out a person....
it picked sean...it killed your father....
dad died from a heart attack....
he died from fear...from having to go out there after it....
there is never been a great white where we live.  it is warm water... they do not like it....
your brother's dead...your father's dead....
he was such a good-natured kid... always going out of his way....
he was doing his job....
it was a piece of wood.  a shitty piece of wood.  it is not fair....
where are you going?
nowhere....
you will spoil her.
that is what grandmas are for.
what do i think?  i think it is a lovely idea....
please, mom.  at least consider it. you should get away.  you should not be alone now....
yes!
you can stay in my room.
I would like that.  i need to be away from here.
I have always wanted to ride one of those....
no way....
chicken....
can i ride one sometime...?
it is too dangerous....
like mother, like son....
my mother always told me, if god had intended us to ride parachutes for fun, we would have been born with free tickets....
i never....
where is the lady who brings the soda?
they had them on the big one....
i have coffee in the thermos.
I am too young for coffee.  can i drive the plane?
thea....
sometimes my father puts me in his lap and lets me steer the jeep.
do not bother hoagie....
jake tells me you are going to have to fly for the rest of your life to pay off what you lost at the crap table....
good news travels fast....
I will get it back next time.
how come it bumps up and down when there is no road?
the wind does that.  ever been to the bahamas before?
no....
first time for everything is the best.  after that you know too much and it is never quite the same.
you must get bored easily.
want to go for a little ride?
i do....
can you just go off...?
I am the captain of this majestic ship.  it goes where i take it....
no cooking while you are here...no washing dishes...no cleaning....
I am not on vacation....
i like grandma's cooking....
thank you....
oh, it looks like my uncle's.  he taught me how to sail when i was a kid....
it is jake's actually...our floating lab....
it sure is good to be home....
it sure is....
it will grow on you.
i like it.  really....
it has its virtues.  it has not fallen down yet....
watch me, grandma....
no, no...it's too dangerous....
mommy lets me....
come on, sweetheart....
but you always let me....
not today.  come on, thea....
daddy, why can not i...?
did you hear what i said?  come inside....
i do not want to.  i want to swing....
oh, i did not mean....  I am being such a grandma....
come on, I will show you around.
i did not mean to start that....
do not be such a grandma...i was always climbing something....
you were a monkey....
all you all right?
I am fine....
how are you doing?
okay.
we have not had a real talk, have we? we will do that before i go.
I will be all right, michael.
good.  so will i....
she calls it, 'tourist on the loose.' local government commissioned it. for the public beach....
we forgot to stop at the store.
make a list.
we need milk....
big unveiling ceremony in a couple of weeks....
we need beer....
I will be right there.
stop farting around....
stop busting my hump....
try the area around the wreck....
how many...?
will you leave me alone...?
you tagging them...?
I am separating the ladies from the gentlemen....
you moved any slower, you would grow roots...we've got a schedule...shake it, man....
the females have eggs....
we will pass around cigars....
we are being paid to see where they go...how they propagate....
if we had some decent money, I would be able to read their temperatures... study their motor systems....
if you would leave me alone, I would be able to get my work done....
michael!  this thing working?
you rigged it...you spent all that money on an education and you come back looking like this....
michael!
i could use a half-dozen more arms ...i've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
do you and michael ever talk about his work...?  about spending so much time working in the water?
usually it is all he talks about...you must not worry....
i can not help it....
i used to worry...but you know what happens, you find out that scuba diving's safer than climbing into the bathtub....
i should not interfere...  my mother-in-law is so neat she puts paper under the cuckoo clock....
henny youngman....
you caught me....
you are not interfering, ellen....
i know how to tag a damn conch....
the readings suck....
maybe it is the tags that suck....
i made them, man....
i stuck them on, man....
you did not stick them on right....
if you made them right, it would not happen...they leak....
a blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
you could not find your ass with both hands....
you leave me high and dry...you come back looking like a zombie....
hey!
should not pick on that.  sorry.  I am sorry about your brother....
yeah, well, just stop yelling.
i missed you, is all.  it is dull around here working alone...smelling all that sweet cologne....
put me down....
they will not fight with me....
put me down, damnit....
maybe i missed you too....
where the hell's the beer...?
your father was six then.  just like you....
I am still five....
nothing out of the ordinary....
once he locked himself in the bathroom and your grandfather had to get the ladder and climb in through the window....
bad boy....
i did not do it on purpose....
you are welcome.  i was the one who cried.
was uncle sean ever bad?  did you ever spank him?
sharp shirt, jake....
may your sex life be as busy as your shirt....
listen to carla...marry me...i'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three am not bad....
do not flatter yourself....
only children are my favorites. that means you, magee....
my tea set.  i got my tea set.  thank you....
can i make sandwiches...?
yes, you can make sandwiches....
matt?
tell thea I am sorry....
i do not know what the hell to say....
you do not have to say anything, matt ...i know how you feel....
yeah....
still chasing fish?
still tagging conch?
we will be done pretty soon....
tricky little devils, are not they? how is the degree doing?
inch by inch....
how is ellen?
she has good days and bad...i do not know....
she is a tough lady....
i wish there was something i could do....
she is had a lot to deal with...she needs time....
would you talk to her?  she is got it in her head that the shark came for him.  she still blames it for my father's death....
oh, boy....
i miss him, matt.  i still can not believe he is gone.
tell matt he should be here....
the stuffing came out of the pillow he was wearing....
feathers all over the place....
it was like having snow in the house ...jesus, i miss them.
let me speak to ellen....
I will get her.  have a good christmas, matt....
you too, michael....
i want you to give up your work....
mom, please do not start that again....
you could teach...you could....
I am not going to quit now....
you are all i have left...i do not want you going in the water....
we have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...so we can swim to it....
you are silly....
you are coming, are not you...?
who is coming?
no one.  nothing.  we have got to get this finished before the tide comes in.
it is not nice to be evasive.
i do not know why i fish here...never catch anything...must be a sign under the water...'beware, hoagie's here....'
you are the man who drives the plane.
flies the plane....
mostly it feels like driving.  you digging for buried treasure?
you the architect?
I am the artist.  like my mother.
we have three months of work and approximately no money left to support it....
spent it all on beer....
office of naval research has some money....
forget it....
money is money....
they put bombs on dolphins....
i know a guy who got money from them to study eels....
a regular tropo...spend the rest of your life in a bathing suit, living off nickel and dime grants.  you want to be a bum all your life, be my guest.  not me.  I am not growing old chasing snails and dying from terminal crotch rot....
it is not a bad life, jake....
you are afraid of the competition out there....
sweet breezes...sweet women....
you have something to say about everything....
he is just trying to keep you from disappearing up your own....
you are nothing but a bunch of goddamn romantics.  you are never going to amount to anything.
i do not know why I have told you all this.  i hardly know you.
sometimes talking to a stranger is easier....
i...i can not explain it.  it is just something i feel.
i always listen to my feelings....
sometimes i think I am going crazy. the nightmares....
it could have been an accident....
it was no accident....
I am not saying you are wrong, just that there are other possibilities....
when it killed sean it was like a stab in the heart.  i knew with absolute certainty that it had come for him. i knew that.  i know it is coming....
what is it cost to take a ride on that plane...?
the water's coming in...the water's coming in....
depends on where you want to go....
does not matter....
hurry!
just like that?
how can you just take the plane like this?
boss' day off...take the wheel....
i can't....
sure you can....
i do not know how....
no one does till they learn....
what are you doing?
if you do not take it, we will be swimming in a minute.
it is just like driving a car....
where do i pull off...?
you are doing fine.  I will keep you out of trouble.  relax....
I am only doing this to get out of my family's hair....
one time i was flying supplies up the amazon.  went down in the jungle....
you are not going to tell me, are you?
got picked up by a tribe of head- hunters....
you are impossible....
they took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
the plane's turning....
how do you like flying?
it is wonderful....
how many?
stop busting my hump....
oh, it is okay for you, but not for me....
I have struck the mother-lode.  I am counting... spade work....
i wish you would not say that....
what?
spade's a garden tool....
trouble with you, jake, is you have no sense of humor....
holy shit!
what is wrong?
nothing....
I am fine.
no, you are not....
I am terrific... come on....
you promised me a drink....
sharks come and go, ellen.  people do not have anything to do with it....
the kind with an umbrella in it....
give it up... kick it in the ass... get on with your life....
a drink with an umbrella in it....
a big one....
a big one....
what the hell's it doing in warm water anyway...?
what difference does it make?  it is here....
you guys are making this into some- thing that just is not so... it is just a shark.  a great big bloody wonderful shark.  do not say anything to anyone. the locals find out they will panic. they will want to kill it.  we have got us a great white, michael. we are going to do us some real research....
do not say anything about this to my mother....
how much longer?  this is supposed to be your party.
in a few minutes....
you want to try your hand at something...?
I would be afraid of losing....
couple of more passes and I will buy my own airplane.. hell, maybe my own airline....
you are not going to bet it all....
all or nothing.  you want to roll them for me?
no!
it was theirs anyway.  i 11 buy us all a drink....
we will buy you one.  we are having a party....
i knew there was a reason i could afford this.  to the woman of my dreams.. who grows more beautiful....
here it comes....
who grows more beautiful....
here comes the cow ca-ca....
more beautiful with each passing minute...
i told you....
now wait a minute... I am being serious here....
oh, jake...
happy birthday, darling. ...
do not go weak in the knees on me tonight....
i just want to make an honest woman of you....
I am not going to marry you until you straighten out your life and your hair.
at least he does not have a beard....
do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
she is in management....
I am training to....
manage the whole damn place some day. I am looking forward to living in the style to which i would like to become accustomed....
I would have to manage a nookie parlor to do that....
woman has taste....
when he has a pillow over his head....
you want to be careful how you talk to me... I am about to become famous...you should see....
would you suffer through a dance with me?
you will be sorry.
i have two right feet.
good.  i have two left....
mind if i cut in?  your date's lonely....
the world would be a better place if more sons danced with their mothers.
you are having a good time....
i am.
i enjoy his company....
i do not like him chasing around after you...i do not trust him....
he is not chasing and I am not running. and that is ridiculous....
I am not going to bother you anymore about your work....
you are not a pain in the ass....
will you let me finish.  I have been working on this all day.
it is not easy.  none of it is.  i have to find some way to get on with my life and I am going to try.  i finally figured that out.  I am going to do my best....
good.
that is it?  good...i thought you would break out the champagne....
I am pleased.  i really am.  really....
no more sharks.  I will stay for another week, then....
you just got here....
children are never satisfied.  i have my house, my friends, my job...my life, michael.  i have to live it. besides, I will be back.  now show your mother what a good dancer you are.
where is everybody?
down here....
what happened to clarence and...?
gave them the day off....
what for?  we have got a job to finish ...why are you making the monitor?
as the sun slowly sets in the west, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
we are out of money, partner.. we wrap it up, write it up and turn it in... how come your heart sounds stronger than mine?  you got two of them...?
we do not write up anything until we are done....
okay.. .we're done, man....
when we got the grant....
when i got the grant.....
when i signed on....
when i invited you...
we got it together, jake....
okay...we got it together....
we have at least three months' work left.  we can not write a report...we do not know enough....
we have got a rare bird here, michael. great whites do not come to the bahamas.  there is never been one down here before.  I am not just going to let it swim away.
my name goes on that report.  it is a half-assed job, i do not get my doctorate.  neither do you....
the shark will get it for us.
i thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
so did i....
i do not know shit about electronics....
you do not know shit about anything. time you learned....
it does not take much to remember what day they come....
my brain is shrinking.  there is only so much room.
do not give me that preoccupied scientist crap.  I am trying to get ready for....
i thought artists worked with their subconscious....
how come it is my responsibility?
because....
i take out the garbage, because...i'm glad we got that straightened out....
we do not have anything straightened out.  you are uptight about something ...what's wrong?
why should there be anything wrong? I am sitting around the house, enjoying my day off and you start yelling at me about garbage....
what the hell are we arguing about?
i do not know...you...i do not know.
no fair, I am not armed.
then do not come any closer.
turn it off....
no....
off....
i have work....
I have always wanted to make love to an angry welder.  I have dreamed of nothing else since i was a small boy.
close the door.
they are at the beach....
you sure you have done this before?
lots of times....
and it is always worked?
so far..
our little island seems to agree with you....
i have my own little island.
but it gets cold in winter....
i tried winter once.  burlington, vermont.  flew a run to new york.  i have a bone in my foot that still has not thawed.  when i was a small boy....
that is hard to imagine....
i dreamed about always being warm... stay a while....
i could take some time off....
you are always taking time off....
i like to travel....
I will nick the boss' plane again....
what?
i borrow it without telling him....
will not you get in trouble...?
only if he finds out... it is a short hop to the caribbean.  we could take a few days....
there must be plenty of women who would be glad to go....
there are...i'm tired of one-way conversations....
i have this overwhelming desire to kiss you, ellen brody.
why?
because it would not occur to you to know why.  blushing suits you....
I am sorry...i....
there is nothing to be sorry about.
the whole idea is preposterous....
you sure you do not need glasses?
my vision is perfect....
what are we getting out of this old bucket?
what she is got.  nine knots....
shit....
how long have you known hoagie?
what?
how long have you known hoagie?
what the hell does hoagie have to do with this?
how long?
as long as he is been here....
bring her to starboard.
how long has he been here...?
who?
hoagie.
i do not remember.  one day he was just here....
what do you know about him?
what is so funny about that?
you think he is not good enough for her?  you are right.  if she was my mother, I would send her home right now.
bring her about.  we are headed in the wrong direction....
half the pilots down here fly drugs ...he's always going off....
half don't...bring her about....
i am...you must know something about him....
he gambles...he likes a good time...i see him around....
i hear he flies a lot of private charters....
we lost it....
maybe the gear crapped out....
if you had not been gassing about hoagie....
maybe it is gone....
all he did was kiss me....
it is beginning....
beginning of what?
whatever happens next.....
i always thought when i grew up I would know what to do about things like this...i do not even know if he is serious....
give it some time, ellen...see what happens.
part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...i do not know why he wants me....
maybe he is got good taste...i do not think he is spent much time with a woman like you....
i do not know what he thinks...i do not know what i think...i do not even know why I am talking about it...  it is silly...i'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
you said it was not polite to interrupt people....
yes, i did.
it is time for tea, grandma.
i almost forgot....
i didn't.
i put everything in my room.  my teddy bear is joining us.
thanks for the consultation....
I will be in to read you a story.
good night, daddy....
it is late....
trying to write our report....
you look tired....
I am fine....
you and sean used to make....
i have to get this finished.
I am leaving in a few days.  i do not want to do that with you unhappy....
i m not unhappy.  frustrated maybe... discouraged a little.  it will work out....
I am worried.. we have not had our....
there is nothing to worry about....
I am your mother.  it is my job....
you looked just like your father... the first time the shark came to amity....
i do not want to talk about that.
it is a terrible thing to know some- thing no one else wants to believe.
I am tired of hearing about it. there is no shark.  sean was not killed by the same shark.. dad did not die because of it...it's all wrong... some fantasy you have concocted...you keep bringing it up.
you hungry?
no.
I have got about a half dozen...i'm going to tag them.  you hearing anything?
nothing.. but stay within a quarter mile...i've got a three-mile radius on the monitor.  if he comes back I will hear him.  you will have time to get up.
I am coming...how close is it?
close...i do not know...just get the hell....
get the bang sticks.  we are going down.
bang sticks are like yelling at it....
we are going down.  all of us....
they will not kill it....
we will divert it...we'll do something....
it is my turn in the barrel, man....
you fall off a horse, you get right back on or you do not ride again....
i do not like it....
i did not ask you to....
what about carla's gig?
I am going down, jake....
she is not going to like it....
i hope the man knows what he is doing....
he knows what he has to do....
you getting a reading on them?
i live to hear the sound...you all right?
what about the monitor...?  you getting anything on the shark?
nothing...hey michael...you know i was thinking about yesterday.  maybe all that was wrong was he was hungry....
how come only me?
maybe he only likes white meat....
funny, jake...funny.
just trying to be helpful....
a moray eel...a moray eel....
'it was so ugly...it was so big....'
'a moray eel....'
'snuck up on me....'
'it got us in hot water...we should have been there for carla....'
shit....
do not be so down, man.  money's gone...shark's gone...we're back to conch...we've got it made....
shove it....
you will be the eternal tropo...the old man and the sea...know the words to this one?  'oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
stop that!
you do not like my voice...?
i do not like the song.
tough shit.  'when the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
you told me what?
screw you, jake....
where have you been...?
what is wrong?  what happened?
thea was attacked by a shark....
the doctor said she should be all right...she's in shock....
but it went away...we would have known....
you knew...?
it went away....
sweetheart....
she could have been killed...you knew and you did not tell us...you let your mother think....
where is she?
how could you do that?  your own daughter....
where is my mother?
i do not know....
why did not you tell us?  why did not you tell us?
I am sorry.  please, carla.  i did not think there was any danger.  I am sorry. i love you.  both of you.
i hope she is a good sailor....
a shark attacked thea and some kids...she's going after it....
you are going after her in that? you are crazy...it'll take all day in that bathtub....
you got a better idea...?
when we find her we will radio her position...the coast guard will pick her up.  do not worry....
she will be all right, partner.. she will never find it.  we couldn't....
what do you mean, it will find her?
she said it was coming....
i want you to leave her alone.  i do not want you involving her in....
what is that....?
what do you deliver on all those charters you...?
i fly elephants for smugglers....
can not this thing go any faster?
any faster and it will turn into a flying cuisinart and dice us into oblivion....
holy christ....
mom....
what the hell are you doing?
I have got to get to her....
you jump, you will kill yourself....
grab your socks....
you sure you know how to do this.
hell, no.  what kind of pilot do you think i am...?
hell, that was not half bad.. get going...i'll keep it busy....
it will come for the plane.  it is attracted to metal.  the electro- magnetic impulse....
will you get the bloody hell out of here....
come on, hoagie....
all you passengers are the same.... complain...complain....
it got him....
why did you come out here?
why did you take the boat?
i tried to tell you...i tried....
give me a hand here for christ's sake....
what say we get the hell out of here, ellen brody. ...
get her started....
maybe the plane gave it indigestion....
they spend half their lives looking for food and the other half eating it   they do not care what it is....
if it works, if we can get it inside the bastard and set it off, it will shock the hell out of it.  we will need a slave switch to set it off. pull the dry cell out of the radio.
anybody ever tell you you are nuts....
all the time....
it will work....
theory, partner...if it responds to external electrical impulse, it might respond to one coming from inside it...confuse it...drive it away....
if we are real lucky, it will eat itself....
wait for the sucker to charge, then hit the switch.  just like taking a picture.
the big picture...if we can not get him to swallow it, we will shove it up his....
i forgot my rubber gloves.  let's do it.
your equipment has crapped out again....
my equipment does not crap out....
I will do it, jake.
no way....
it is my fault...i have to....
we need it to eat electronics, man ...not you.  get it on me....
jake.
I am the one who wanted to study it....
keep it steady....
aye, aye, captain....
what happened?
nothing!  what the hell are you doing down there?
the damn thing is going to have our asses....
it needs more time to charge.
i can't....
yes you can....
i want you all to come to amity this summer.
there is a lot...i want to talk about it....
we will...we'll have a lot of time together.  what are you going to do now?
we will be there....
you make sure they come?
i will.  I will miss you, grandma.
I will miss you....
promise me you will be all right....
promise me....
I will wear my rubbers...i'll be careful ...i'll be....
can you keep a secret?  something no one else knows?
yes i can....
i own the airplane.  i can do whatever i want.  I am the boss.
we will...we'll have a lot of time together, michael....
I am going to finish what jake and i started.  i owe him that.  hell, i owe him everything....  I will get something important done for both of us....
