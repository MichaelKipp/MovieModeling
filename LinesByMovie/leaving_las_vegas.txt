i do not want this. yuri, please. i really do not want this. you know i do not like to do groups.
i want this, sera. i need this!
please, yuri.
hey, brad... how is it going?
hey ben. there were a couple of guys looking for you.
what did they look like?
suits. i did not tell them anything. you know anything about gears?
how did this happen?
i was going real fast down on the beach and something slipped and everything got jammed up.
the news is not good, kid. this bit here... see there... it is broken. you need a new  one.
how much, do you think?
i do not know. I will find out though.
you have been lonely?
I have been all right.
i will keep you safe. we are both older.
you have been lonely?
i am lonely, yuri.
I am pleased with you, sera... how you have moved up in the world. i showed you a glamorous world when i took you off the streets...  and how you repay me.
where have you been staying?
with an old friend.
it is, after all, sera, my money.
yes, of course. how much do you need?
all of it. i need to buy many things... all of it!
there is a one-drink minimum per show, i hope you saw the sign when you came in. anyway, they are supposed to tell you.
yes, i heard, and it is not a problem.
what do you want?
what are my choices?
everything's ten dollars, and there is no alcohol.
no alcohol?
no alcohol. you got to get something else. everything's ten dollars. what do you want?
what do you think i should get?
non-alcoholic malt beverage?
...noooo.
orange soda?
no.
coffee?
no.
sparkling apple cider?
no.
water?
water?
one drink minimum per show. everything's ten dollars. now... tell me what you want or I will eighty- six you.
water.
hello!
hello.
are you working?
working? what do you mean, working? I am walking.
is not it illegal to drink and drive?
that is funny.  i wonder if you will take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
that is, if you will come to my room for an hour, i will give you five hundred dollars.
maybe you should not stand in the road like that. you are pretty drunk.
you are pretty drunk.
not really. my room's not far. the whole year inn. you can drive with me if you want...
sarah -- with an h?
no -- s.e.r.a.
I am sort of curious... if you are willing to pay me two-fifty... not that i mind... i mean, I am ok with that -- why are not you staying in a hotel?
we can go to one if you would prefer.
no, this is fine. i was just wondering.
umm. we can stay in the car for an hour if you want. but i really have to go then. it is your time.
right, I will get your door. i tend to fade in and out lately.
i guess i do too.
you what?
i sometimes fade out.
oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
you were going to get my door.
mind if i use the bathroom?
of course.
want a drink? I am having one.
a shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
of course.
do you want to fuck now?
maybe another drink first. more tequila?
ok... whatever.
what is the story? are you too drunk to come?
i do not care about that. there is time left. you can have more money. you can drink all you want. you can talk or listen. just stay, that is all i want.
no, i came here to drink... myself... you know...
to death?
yes, that is right.
i cashed in all of my money, paid my amex card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
how long's it going to take, for you to drink yourself to death?
i think about four weeks, and I have got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
yes... that should do it. what am i? a luxury?
yeah. and your meter just ran out.
where have you been?
it was a slow night. i went to a hotel for a few drinks.
a full night on the street and this is all?
like i said... it was a slow night... I am sorry. it was hard to score.
do not hit me.
what do you think... you are sixteen years old on hollywood boulevard?
about ready for another drink?
yes, that would be great. are you her for the convention?
do i look that obvious? my name's paul.
so... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
alone. alone. I am here alone.
where are you staying?
right here at the hotel. why?
well... i thought you might be looking for a date.
a date. what, are you a hooker?  what do you mean a date?  I have got a wife back home. i just came over to talk for a few minutes.
I am sorry, i guess i misunderstood.
please do not raise your voice. i will not bother you about it again.
sorry. look... you seem like a nice girl. I am just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
if i was I am sorry.
no, just drunk... but that is ok. where is your car?
i sold it this morning. I am going to take cabs from now on in.
do not run away.
why should i? i know you are not a cop, so what is it tonight? another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
what is up?
i was looking for you tonight. i do not know if you have a boyfriend...
...or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner.
are you serious.
i think you know I am serious. I will pay you if you like... but I would like to see you.
no, i can not have dinner with you.
yes? what?
it is me, yuri.
have you told anyone that I am here?
no.
go, sera.  go. stay at home. i will call you tomorrow.
yuri... are you...
sera... please go.
yes.
i have to change and take a shower first. if you want to come home and wait.
we should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. i owe you one.
you do?
this is the home of an angel.
you ok out there?
yes. take your time. I am fine.
you ok?
of course. wow... you look extremely beautiful.
thank you. what time is it?
do not know. my watch went the way of the car.
I am rambling. i really like you. you make me want to talk... i do not know what time it is.
i like hearing you talk.  if you feel up to a short walk, there is a place to eat around the corner. all the food in vegas is terrible so the place does not really matter. how does that sound to you?
do they have drinks?
I am from the east. i went to college, did an arts course. i now live in vegas. i think of it as home. i came here deliberately to carve out a life. i was in la before, but I will come back to that later.  the tough times are behind me now. i can deal with the bad things that happen. there will always be dark characters. but my life is good. it is as i would want it to be. so, why are you a drunk?
is that really what you want to ask me?
yes.
well, then i guess this is our first date... or our last. until now, i was not sure it was either.
very clever.
first. it is our first. I am just concerned. so... why are you killing yourself?
interesting choice of words. i do not remember. i just know that i want to.
want to kill yourself? are you saying that you are drinking as a way to kill yourself?
it was not so important to me. i mean, he never asked me why i was a hooker, and that was impressive. i really liked him. so i decided to just play my part. i mean... it is good to help someone once in a while, it is a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. i suddenly came to a decision.
what are you thinking? are you angry with me?
ben, why do not you stay at my place tonight? i mean... look, you are so drunk. i like you. i trust you.
that is astonishing. sera, look...
i hate to think of you in that cheesy motel. i mean...
let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in las vegas?
I am going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it will make you feel better.  let's talk about tomorrow. wanna do something?
sure... tonight. then please stay at my place.
sera... you know I am not much good in the sack.
it is not about sex, ben. I will make you up a bed on the sofa. do it for me. we can talk till late and then sleep till late. as you know, i am my own boss.
how long have i been here?
three nights, two days. when is your rent coming up at the motel?
i do not know.  I will go and sort it out today. why do not you come?... we will find a real room for me. you can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
there is no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
what do you mean?
what i mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. we are spending all this time together... what the fuck!
sera...
let's face it, ben, we are having fun here. I have never done so much talking in my life.
me neither.
so! let's dispense with the formalities. i want you here... now!
sera you are crazy.
so... I am not too concerned with long term plans.
do not you think you will get a little bored living with a drunk?
that is what i want. why do not you go and get your stuff?
you have not seen the worst of it. these last few days I have been very controlled. i knock things over... i throw up all the time.  now i feel really good... you are like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that will not last forever. you will get tired of it really quickly. believe me.
do not you like me, ben?
do not be silly?
sera... what you do not understand is...
what?
you can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. do you understand?
i do. i really do.  ok. i have to do some shopping alone. you go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. do not hurry and I will be back before you to let you in.
hi!
why do not you go in and sit down. i have some gifts for you.
right... ok...
want a drink? great nap. wanna go out tonight?
seriously, ben... i need to keep pretty low-key around here. maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. that was the landlord.
of course.
ben?
sorry.
sera, i love that name... s.e.r.a. before we proceed onwards, there is something i need to say. ok?
ok.
I have come this far... here i am, in your house. i want you to let me pay the rent for this month. all right?
why?
because... it is better for me that way. ok?
well... ok...
sera... i hope that you understand how i feel about this. first of all, you are welcome to my money. we can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. but i do not think you are talking to me right now about money.
no?
no. i think you are talking about you. I will tell you right now that I am in love with you... but, be that as it may, I am not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
i know that...
...and I am not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. we know I am a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. and i know that you are a hooker. i hope you understand that I am a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I am indifferent or that i do not care... i do... it simply means that i trust and accept your judgement. what I am saying is... that i hope you understand that i understand.
thanks, i do understand. i was worried about how that would be... but now I am not. and you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
ah, yes... i suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
whatever that means. open your presents.
right... the suitcase was clinking. so what did you do with your clothes?
i threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but i wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. i thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
nice talk, ben. keep drinking. in between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth.
I am going to fill it right now.
do you want to go gambling tonight? we could go out and play for a few hours.
giving you money makes me want to come.
then come.  I am going to change. watch tv. I will be half an hour.
i am planning to go out and do some work.
when?
tomorrow night as a matter of fact.
i like women who wear mismatched earrings.
well, then... i hope we do not run into any tonight.
what do you mean?
i expect some kind of loyalty here. just because i fuck for money does not give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
how are you doing?
very well... umm... i never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? i remember getting to the casino... i remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
well -- i was prepared for worse, but it was not so bad. we were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. you seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and i put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. you smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. you kept yelling and yelling.
oh, and what did you do?
i tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. they wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but i talked them into letting me walk you out.
that is impressive. how did you do that?
i told them you were an alcoholic and i would take you home. i also promised that we would never come in there again.
we?
you were ok for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but i think even you knew that was not going to happen. we got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though i told you that we had plenty at home. in the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. i asked you if you knew it was a hundred. you said you did, so i let you do it. we got here, you fell asleep on the couch and i covered you up and came to bed.
i warned you...  ...but I am sorry.
here's my speech...  ...i know this should not be acceptable to me, but it is. do not ask me why. i sense that your trouble is very big... and I am scared for you... and so I am doing what i think you need me to do. falling down in casinos is little stuff. it does not bother me. it has nothing to do with us.
that is amazing. what are you? some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? how can you be so good?
why do not you go back to sleep. I will go out and buy us some breakfast.
be careful.
very creative. now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
ok, but remember that they wear it because they have to. i wear it because i want to. that will make me look different. let's get a drink.
your color.
i think you should wear one at a time. one of these... and one of your others. in fact, i was going to buy just one, but i did not think it would fly... as a gift, i mean.
what was that all about?
can we just forget it?
i do not understand any of that.
can we just ignore it?
please!
yes... I will give you that.
thank you, sera.
do you want me not to go tonight?
no... we already talked about that.
maybe i should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it is like to sleep with you.
they would not know.
I will be back home around three. if you are back by then we can watch tv or something... i guess what I am saying is... that i hope you are back when i get home. please be careful.
you be careful to. I am going to miss you.
shall we go away for a couple of days?
yeah... I would like that.
years ago, in la, i turned a trick on sunset and western. the guy was polite and did not argue about the price. he parked his car and i took him to a house that i had an arrangement with. a fat mexican woman was watching a tv and i told him to give her the twenty for the room. there were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. the room had a bed and a dresser. he lay on his back on the bed and i put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then i eased on to him. about twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. i felt kind of guilty because he had not come and i offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. when we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. he gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. i remember being relieved that i would not have to work again that evening.
last spring i happened to walk past a house that i had once patronized. there was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window i could see a bare leg. the girl must have been taking a break between customers. it was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that i was late for something already i just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I am telling you this epilogue is that i felt that I would come full circle.
where was that house? the one in la, i mean.
fifth and mayflower. you know it?
yes. one of my friends was there. i wonder if you ever clipped her.
i like it here with you.
let's stay for a while.
ok.
I have missed the best sun. why did you have to pawn your watch?
i did not know I would ever need it again.
maybe it is time i moved to a hotel.
and do what... rot away in a room?  we are not going to talk about that. fuck you! i will not talk about that. you are staying here. you are not moving to a hotel.
will you lighten up, please?
one thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I have given you gallons of free will here! you can do this for me.
there are limits.
yes... i guess i knew that.
i wanted to see you...
oh, ben... you look so very sick... my love... you are so pale.
you know i love you... yeah?
yes.
