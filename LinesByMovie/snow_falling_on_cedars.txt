and you were not there, when the coroner examined the wound.
nossir.  I would gone to tell the wid... to tell mrs. heine.
so, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.
these are fishermen, alvin.  they do not talk at all to each other and less to me.  specially gossip.
i did.  boy.
three kids.  what is she going to do?
as peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a single overturned cup in its wake?
objection, asking the witness to speculate.
my gosh, alvin, was i supposed to object every time you did that?
maybe the assailant straightened the cabin.  and forgot the cup.
right.  in the middle.  of the floor.
maybe.
i think you testified all the lights were on.  cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
yessir, there would been real heavy fog.
and yet you started the engine right up.  with all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge.  did that strike you odd?
did not think about it at the time. so no, it did not strike me odd.
does it now?
a little.  yes.  you have to wonder.
you have to wonder.
you found three batteries, you say.  a d-6 and d-8 in the well. and a spare d-8 on the cabin floor. correct?
it is.
now i did some measuring down at the chandlery.  a d-6 is one inch wider than a d-8.  it would be too large for the deceased's well.
he is done some on-the-spot refit- ting.  you could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the d-6.
but he had a spare d-6, you said. right there.  why not use that?
it was dead.  we had it tested. maybe the d-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on defendant's boat?
two d-6's.  that is the kind his well was fitted for.
no spare.
no.
so the defendant went out fishing for the night with no spare battery, hmmn?
apparently.
I am curious.  the d-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
i believe so.
now you have testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
i do not think so.
you don't.  think so.
he was heavy, but we were real careful.  but i do not remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
you don't.  remember.
operating this winch you would rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it possible.  possible that he struck his head after death. possible?
possible.  but not darn likely.
...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.
he said, 'could it be somebody hit him?'  and i said, 'you want to play sherlock holmes, here?'
did you say more?
i said that if i was playing sherlock holmes...i'd maybe look for a... japanese person.  with a bloody gun- butt.  a right-handed fella, to be precise.
and why.  is that?
well, i was a doctor in the jap theater, in the war.  i saw those kendo wounds, many times.  looked exactly like this one.
could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
japanese stick-fighting.  they are trained as kids, y'know.  to kill with sticks.
so this...foam you found in the lungs.  how does it get there?
as i testified.  it occurs when water, mucus and air are mixed by respiration.  i believe i said that.
that is why the autopsy report identifies drowning as the cause of death.
meaning that he was not murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
well...
your report says death by drowning, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  and the report is accurate...?
in your motorcycle example.  those injuries are produced by the head being propelled against an object. rather than the reverse, yes?
obviously.
can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around?  or would both look the same.
the same.
so if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
if the head was moving fast enough, but i do not see how it could be.
is it possible?
sure, anything's poss...
is it fair to say that you do not know for certain which it was.
i already said that, b...
and that you can not say for certain whether the head injury was sustained before or after death?
for certain, no.
but you are certain that he died by drowning.
for the third time, yes.
can i say something, here?
yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  the report says 'recent origin'.  how recent?  as much as 24 hours before death?
absolutely not.  probably one or two hours.  four at the most.
are you absol...
yes, I am sure.
he is still got a good grip.  we need to dig more.
at school, she kept mostly to the japanese kids, and sort of ignored me.  as if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
i told myself that was good.  that it made our friendship special.  and did not mean she was ashamed of it. necessarily.
easy.  slow is best.
the best part was that there was a 'this'.  to debate the wrongness of.
your friends would.  your dad would kill me with a machete.
we are japanese, not mexican, ishmael. he will slice you up with a ceremonial sword.
my mom.  would be the problem.
why?  we are only talking.
him and his folks and two brothers and two sisters worked our land. lived in a picker's cabin at first.
so the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
they fished t'gether.  went to school. carl junior treated him like a white person.  like any friend.
but back in '34, japanese-born could not own land.  so...?
carl held it for 'em.  called it a lease.  they make payments every june and december...
why?  if they could never take title.
their kids was born here.  so when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
now defendant's father had also died by that point.  where was the defendant?  when you sent his family their equity.
in the war.  europe, i believe. they could hardly send him to the pacific, could they?
and when he came home.  did he write you about this?  or phone, perhaps.
just showed up at my door, big as life and twice as mean.  wanted to talk to my son.
what do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
well.  every time i see him in town or somewhere, he is starin' at me with these narrow eyes. givin' me his mean face.
when your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
that he would keep an eye on miyamoto. watch out for him.
did he see some danger from defen...
objection.  asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
all right.  what did your son say to that effect?
just three questions.  the miyamoto family bought your seven acres for $4500?
tried to.  defaulted on their payments.
second question.  what did ole jurgensen pay you per acre?
a thousand.
so that makes what would have been $4500 into $7000, does not it?  if you sent the equity back, you had a profit of $2500.
is that your third question?
it is.
you done your math right.
robbed.  he was angry.
oh, yeh.  he said someday he would get his land back.
mr. jurgensen.  did he offer to buy the seven acres from you?
oh, yeh.  but this is nine year ago, i had my healt, i was not wantin' to sell.
and then your stroke came this summer.  and you put your property on the market, i believe you said september 7.  which, remember, is eight days before carl heine died. and who comes spetember 7, wanting to buy?
carl heine came.
but carl was a fisherman.  and successful at it.
he said he did not want that life no more.  he would been saving to buy a farm.  he was sorry i got sick. but pretty excited to get back his father's place.
what makes you think i play?
your daddy played.  i asked, down at the japanese community center. you smoke cigars?
white or black?
you mean, do i like to take the offensive?  or hang back and wait.
you must think i like losing.
i think you like learning.
bet there is a few things you could teach me.  kendo, for one.
sure.  i could take a fishing gaff and split your head open. right above your left ear.
you would not even see it move.
you are wonderin'...how come i never ask.  if you did it.
now this jury is going to be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. and at you with the oth...
mr. gudmundsson, we know what that jury is looking at.
so every time you think about showing that jury strength.  or honor or composure.  or dignity.
i should show them an american?
i can just feel my spirits soar.
well, i do not do it for just anybody.
there can not be any wrong in this, ha...
i lie to my parents every day. and every night.
my father can not get our money from the bank.  we have a few dol...
it will be over soon.  i can get you money.
it is just pearl harbor.  people are a little crazy, right n...
look at my face.  it is the face of the people who did that.  my father hardly speaks english.  we are in bad trouble, you have to see that.
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side.  and it is brand new.  unlike the rest.
and the next one...?
from carl heine's boat.  all his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops.  not bowlined like miyamoto's.
and the last...?
found on carl's boat, too.  starboard side, second cleat from the stern. but it does not match carl's lines. it matches miyamoto's.  perfect.
so if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat.  with that last one.  would those cleats have lined up?
you bet.  and if miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on carl's boat.
and replaced it later with the new one.  that is your inference?
pretty darn clear.
what for, sheriff?
we have a warrant.  to search your boat.
you always run with the well open?
i was checking the cables.
see you replaced a mooring line, lately.  this one's new.
naw, i had that around for a while.
sure you did.  help me with this hold cover, willya?
you gaff with the hook end. blood's on the butt.  where your hand goes.
sure.  blood gets all over your hand, sheriff, ask any fisherman.
sheriff, i can not afford not to fish toni...
look, no way I am lettin' you out there.  in a half hour you could be in canada.
how is your mother-in-law?
she is alright, nels, thanks for asking.
and her farmhouse...?
the damage was considerable. but she is insured.  thanks, again.
one d-6 and one d-8 in the well. and a dead d-8 on the deck.
which you inferred was replaced by the d-6, which must have been a spare.
what else could it be?
even though a d-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in.  which makes it a peculiar choice. for a spare.
you said that.  that was your testimony.
so the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all.  it was human, yes?  type b positive.
carl heine's type.
but you can not say with any certainty that the blood was his.
no, but as i say, the type is rare. ten percent of caucasian males.
and the blood could not have belonged to defendant.  seeing that his type is o negative.
that is obvious.
you scraped the dried blood from the butt of the gaff.  where a fella's hand goes.  and what did you see under your microscope, besides the b positive blood and the wood scrapings...?
bits of blood and wood.  what else would there be?
no bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
none.
well, if the blood got onto the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
I am a hemotologist, sir, i was asked only t...
i do not know.
you don't.
with no bone or scalp or hair present.  would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
I am a hemotologist, not a detective.
...or from the cut on his hand. which is more probable?
they were japanese-american boys, yes sir.
and you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
it was my specialty, sir, i trained several thousand over the years.
so.  wide cross-section of men to evaluate.  and the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration.  did you find him eager?
more than eager.  he was out to make a point.
well, what then, sergeant?
what else?  i had the boy teach me kendo.  including...the importance of the bow.
and your evaluation of the defendant?  could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? so quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
oh, in a heartbeat.
so your husband said he is think it over.  encouraged mr. miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
i would not say encouraged.
well, he did not say 'no', did he? did not say no hope existed.
not in those words.
so the defendant was encouraged to hope.  or could have been.
i guess you would have to guess. not having been there with them. having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.
carl never lied.
of course not.  but it was emotional.  a friend's plea set against his mother's attitude.
those 'dirty looks'.  defendant ever aim one of those at you?
he had no reason to.
carl ever say he got one?
i can not speak for him.
you can speak for what he said. just like you did for mr. hooks...
sorry about that, mrs. heine. shall i repeat the ques...
carl said he did not like kabuo much anymore.
the question is more about the defendant's attitu...
that is all he said.
we all expect the world to be fair. as if we have some right t...
i do not mean everyone.  just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  or run a newspaper.
you have the night watch?  on the radio.
since september.  last guys got transferred.
and you keep the records, or contribute to 'em.
shorthard the radio transmis- sions, write 'em up, file 'em in a cabinet.  nobody ever looks. just take up space.
i could not say anything.  i just stood there, hating her.
I am sorry about your arm.  kabuo and i.  are very sor...
the japs did it.
how long you have this detail?
me and smoltz came on dogwatch september 16.
you mean, early morning the 16th?
no, night of the 16th, morning the 17th.  we replaced two guys named miller and milholland.
they got transferred that day. out to cape flattery.
some seaman's loast report. stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever.  no one knows.
I am married, ishmael.  it is not right for us to be alone.  people will t...
there is no one here, and I have got to talk to you.
you have to hear this, i can never touch you, ishmael.  not once, not ever.  there is no half- way.  as much as i know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
look, i want to forget you, i do. i think if you hold me, just this once, i can walk away and never speak to you again.
you do not believe in god anymore.
agnostics do not believe or disbelieve, ma.  we just do not pretend we know.
i felt milholland's report in my pocket.  and wondered why i was not telling her.  telling someone. what I would found.
you have been busy with that trial, i suppose.  such a travesty...
they only arrested that poor soul because he is japanese.
seattle boys think he is guilty.  they say the evidence is rock solid.
they are not his neighbor, like you are.  he is a husband, a father, he risked his life for their country. the same as you.
those are not the facts that matter.
your father fought at belleau wood, it took him years to get over it.  nightmares, tears, b...
...but he found you.
i said 'excited'.  not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
you were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
happy for him.  and relieved.
so, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news.  yes?
we hear how carl...passed away. only a few hours later.
your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
closer to eight.
so, five hours.  plenty of time for a call.  he was 'excited', you say. in the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
you thought the deceased might... break his promise?
of course not.  we are just not quick to run and boast.  in case something went wrong.
and then, something did.  carl heine was found dead.  with his head crushed.
yes, and then, what was there to call about?  everything was up in the air.
up in the air?  was that your reaction?
we discussed that.  and decided not to.
why not?
because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
but if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
trials are not only about truth, mr. hooks.  even though they should be.  they are about what people believe is true.
so you hid the truth.  deliberately.
we were afraid.  silence seemed better.  to come forward seemed like a mistake.
well, it seems to me...
does not it seem to you, mrs. miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful?  concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.
it seems human.  to me.
question withdrawn, you may step down.
you are implying th...
i said.  no further questions.
now, mister gi...
unwritten rule of the sea.  we do not bother each other, stick to ourselves. ask anybody.
now if you wanted to kill a man. think you would try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
it is a joke.  maneuver up to carl's boat?  tie your lines fast?  come aboard?  all against carl's will? it is the stupidest suggestion i ever heard of.
I am sorry about that.  it was not mine in the first place.
so the fishing gaff method would not make sense?
could not get on the boat.  I would just shoot the feller.  then tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  and skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
now the sheriff believed that the d-6 battery in carl's well was carl's own spare.  even though it was too large f...
no sense to have any at all., even the right size.  it is like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.  nobody does.
boat has two batteries.  lose one you run off the other til morning. carl musta lost both, so miyamoto there gave him one a his.
course, if carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio would not work.  so how would he signal for help?
compressed air horn, most likely. hope to god some man hears you in that fog.
all right, what if the defendant heard?  so carl let him aboard, to help.  and then the fishing gaff?
you mean miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?
well, what if?
now, how is miyamoto going to know in advance?  that carl loses two batteries.  must happen once ever' 20 years or so.
thank you, mr. gillanders.  thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  specially for mr. hooks.
and what is that?
that you came upon carl by accident. like you said.  gave him the battery. like you said.  asked him about the seven acres.  like you said.
I am more a hot-blooded killer, huh? like a soldier.  like a samurai.
you will not hear that from hooks. because the charge is first-degree murder, which requires premeditation. he can not change the charge.
you want me to say that.
i want you.  to tell the truth.
you think that is the truth.
i told your wife.  trials are not always so much about actual truth. as about what folks believe is true. that is sad.  and it is real.
and what do you believe?
do not know how long it is take to get a charge...
keep it tonight.  we will catch fish. I will see ya back on the docks...
seven acres.  I am wonderin' what you would pay for 'em.  just curious, is all.
what are you sellin' 'em for? why do not we start there.
the battery's in, that is done with.  besides, you would do the same for m...
...might do the same.  i have to warn you 'bout that, chief.  I am not screwed together like i used to be.
i am a bastard.  I am a big hun nazi son of a bitch.  and i still got your bamboo fishing rod.
oh, yeh?
hid it from my mom.  caught a mess a sea runs.  damn thing's still in my closet.
$1200 an acre, that is what i paid ole, will not take a dime less.  you got no choice on that.
did not say i was buyin' did i? what you want down?  just bein' curious, is all.
as my wife testified, we were considering it.
actually, she said you had decided. decided not not come forward.
sheriff said right off, i was under suspicion.  i did not have a lawyer...
but even after you had an attorney.  you still claimed to know nothing.  claimed not to have seen carl. am i correct?
yes.  initially.
well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir.  you would been arrested, you had a lawyer, and you still claimed ignorance!
i should have told everything right away.  i know that now, and i regret it.
should have told 'everything'. meaning, you should have told the truth.
my apologies.  do you regret not telling the truth?
i have told the truth.
you mean, this morning.  the new story, the battery story. that one is the truth?  that is a question, sir.
i see.  now what happened the day carl heine was found?  before your arrest.
i slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  we talked for a few hours.  i left at six and went straight to my boat.
did not go anywhere else?  no errands, no purchases?  just straight to the boat.  that is the truth.
yes.
well, the sheriff found two batteries in your well.  if you left one with carl heine, how is that possible?
i had a spare battery in my shed. i brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.
you are a hard man to trust, sir. you sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...
objection!
did you write that column?
i did.  but the jury will not s...
it is not for the.  they only get to convict him.
you said three minutes.
will not take two.
never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
it is public record.  if the public cares enough to read it.
here now, what are you fixin' to do?
have a look.  at nothing.
you gonna climb that with one arm?
you are right.  i better use two.
it is on the twine, too.  but it is not r...
do not prove there was two lanterns. coulda been the one in the cabin.
it is the way it happened, i know it is.
no, you don't.
this tastes horrible, hmmn?
you are wondering why i held it.
I am wondering how the judge is going to like my waking up his old bones.  in the middle of the night.
your daddy.  was quite a feller.
yes, he was.
he is looking down.  and he is not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  he is proud of the man you are tonight.  that is what counts.
to my father.  everything counts.
tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
well.  it shows the prosecutor was wrong.  it was carl's boat that was dead in the water.  or he would never have put up the lantern.
now you believe there were two lanterns when defendant arrived. one in carl's hand.  the second lashed to the mast.
that is what mr. miyamoto reported, and he would have no reason to lie. he could not know that it would help his case.
well, why does it?
because the second lantern, the one on the mast.  was never found.  so we have to ask...
maybe it went.  where carl went. over the side.
objection!  speculation.
your honor, all of this is speculation.  including mr. hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
tht was summation, your h...
that is when he fell.
fell.
miyamoto gave him the battery, and left.  carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing.  but at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
still lashed to the mast.
he figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  so he climbs up.  to cut it down.
just as the freighter comes through? is not that quite a coincidence?
coincidences happen.  you run a yellow light just as a car comes out of nowhere.  split-second tragedy happens every day.  or maybe...
maybe...?
maybe carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  same report milholland heard.  and that makes him get the lantern fast.  before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
but you could be wrong.  he could have climbed up earlier.
then where is the lantern?  and where is the knife?
the knife.  what knife?
still a coincidence.  timing and all.
the freighter started through at 1:42.  the sea water seeped into carl's watch and stopped it. at 1:47.
still and all.  carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
he hit his head.  on the way in.
you think so?
the sheriff and the deputy and i inspected the deck closely.  we found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel.  just below the mast.
well, anything coulda caused that.
everything had to happen just right.  for your little story to fly.  i mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a lot of reasons.
I am sorry, was there a question in there?
well, the freighter.  the twine. the blood.  the knife.  the cup. the watch.  the second battery. the phantom lantern.  the fishing gaff.  the cracked gunnel.  the skull wound.  the blond hair.  that is eleven things...
twelve.
and since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  what is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
my expertise.  is that I am a journalist.
then putting them together.  so truth is revealed.
but is not the truth that there are several other ways to explain each of these twelve pieces.
oh, yes.
your line of work.  you must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.
like you could not believe.
greedy.
he did not want to lose any more.
i asked you a question, you are writing a tract, h...
that is how journalists.  answer questions.
and i would not blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  at a tactic that insults their intelligence.
that is curious.  i was appealing to their intelligence.
were you, sir?  can you prove one word of all your fancy story?
no, sir, i can't.  not beyond a reasonable doubt.
cigarette?
I will take two.  one for later.
if i whistle.  those boys'll see you, and come runnin'.  you're the story today.
you ever been strangled by a single hand?
naw, I have seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.
we do not let go, you s...
it is a rare thing.  takes a turning point.
