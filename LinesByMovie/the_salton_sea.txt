how the hell did we get this detail?
guess it is our turn.
what time is it?
twelve
midnight?
where to?
i know a guy.
lead the way.
nice day
i had not noticed.  I have seen you around.  what is your name?
jimmy.  everyone calls me jimmy the finn.
why is that?
my features. they are finnish.
you do not say.
finland is a country.
well, jimmy the finn, let's go score some gack.
bobby?
shhh.
what?
the spiders.
jimmy, jimmy, jimmy, jimmy. rhymes with simmy.
yeah.
what can i do for you?
um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
what?
come on.  ease off the girl.
fuck man. come on, bobby.
bobby, bobby, bobby.  rhymes with ...
nice dealer you got there, jimmy.
oh ... that.  ah, he was just juiced. he would not have did nothin'
I have got a hot one.
you go, boy.
if it is all the same to you, I would rather not dish right here in the middle of crankville.
feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
well, you know what they say, just because you are paranoid, does not mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
you got a name?
bobby, rhymes with hobby.
what?
never mind.  dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
no last name?
it was all pretty informal.  did not have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
this the guy?
it speaks!
that is him.  he is a lot prettier in person though.
cut to the fucking chase, flynne.
dude is bugging.  transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
what is he holding?
yeah. pretty sure.  oh yeah ... he had a spear gun, too.
god damn, flynne, you are one observant tweaker.
somebody has to help you lazy bastards.
danny, I am touched.
do not be. I am worried about the kid.
then why did not you help the kid when you were there?
hey, you want me to do all your work for you, numbnuts?
I will tell you why you did not help - because you are a chickenshit tweaking snitch.  you are a bottom feader, flynne.
garcetti, you are teeth, they are fucking perfect.
a virtuoso rendition.  tom van allen is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of miles davis' haunting, moody piece.
thank you.  thank you very much.
and he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
again, i thank you.
i was talking about miles.
you, madam, are a heartless wench.
and you have got wiener breath.
really?
it is that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
tom, let's spend the night here.
there is no motels around here.
no.  right here on the beach.  come on. let's do it.
you think I am a judas?
hard to compare the people you are taking down with the lord.
garcetti thinks I am a pile of shit.
garcetti thinks everything is shit. he does not even like dolphins.
thanks for not judging me.
it is not my place.
do not you wonder why i do it?
the money? the drugs? keeping yourself out of jail? i know the drill.
you do not find that repugnant?
just the way the world works.  look, as far as tweakers go, you are not a bad guy.  you never hurt anyone but yourself as far as i know.
tell that to bobby ... and his wife and kid.
bobby laid his own tracks.  he could have gone quietly but he played the hard-ass con till the end. and as far as I am concerned, he wife and kid are a hell of a lot better off without him.  now take the money.
i was getting to it.
tell me what?
danny, it is really pains me to have to tell you this, but do you remember domingo, that wetback you helped us put away for trafficking a few months back?
yeah.  what about him?
turns out he is connected.
to who?
the mexicali boys
and what does this have to do with me?
he knows somebody ratted him.
what?!
and he is making a lot of noise about having his homies hang a colombian necktie on whoever it was.
if he finds out it is me, I am a dead man.
danny, he is not going to find out it is you.  domingo was a slinger, he must have sold to hundreds of different people.
fuck you, garcetti. i been at this for almost a year. I have done everything you guys have asked of me.
anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
look, we will talk to the a.d.a.
when?
soon. i promise.  we will get the charges dropped and you can disappear.  in the mean time, trust me, he has no idea that you ratted him out.
ride 'em cowboy)
you like that?
who wouldn't?
first rate, am not it?
it is downright classy is what it is.
I am hurting.
you on a roll?
was.  I am on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  you got anything for me?
sorry.
why does it have to feel so bad?
you are brain is in reverse mode ... cutting off your supply of dopamine. here.  have a beer.
that is a good one.
I am serious, dude.  you always seem to be on top of things, even when you are tweakin'.
i guess there is just no substitute for good genes.
so, why did you want to see me?
business.  i need to leave town and i find myself in dire need of some cash.
see that?  that is just what I am talking about.
what?
you. you are smooth. you use words like dire and shit.  you got language skills, man.
do not get carried away.
i find myself in dire need of some cash.
you remember that guy you told me about ... said he could handle a big hook-up?
yeah, pooh-bear.  dude is a big-time cook. I am talking dire.
i know a buyer.  guy's looking for a quarter's worth.
a quarter?  danny that am not even worth ...
a quarter of a million, jimmy.
fuuuuuck
can your man handle that?
i think so.  i mean, we would have to talk to him.
can you set that up?
sure.
I am getting a 10% finder's fee from my man if i can get the right price.
10%.  that is ...
jimmy, where do you find these people?
the del ammo mall mostly.
you wanna score some go-fast?
not tonight.
hey, why do you need a gun and a vest anyway?
personal protection. it is a dangerous world we live in, jimmy, a very dangerous world.
you know, jimmy, you might as well put a sign on the back of this thing asking the cops to pull you over.
you mean, like to throw 'em off?
yeah, that is what i mean.  where the hell does this guy live anyway?
palmdale
why do they call him pooh-bear?
i think on account of his nose.
you are going to have to explain that one.
he does not have one.
you are going to have to give me a little more than that, jimmy.
you ever see queen elizabeth sleep?
no  you think she is a tweaker?
I am going to get this developed and send it to the warren commission.
um, i think the warren commission has been closed for a while.
no shit?  fuck it.  I will send it to oliver stone then. he will get them to reopen the bastard.
yeah, i uh, have a buyer who is looking for about a quarter's worth.
crank or glass?
the good stuff.  can you handle that?
I am sorry.  would you like a taste?
no, I am good.
i insist. it is delicious. just a taste.
not bad.
secret recipe.
can we talk price?
make me an offer.
i do not know, 14,000 a kilo?
i deal in u.s. pounds, friend. none of that faggot metric crap for me.
okay ... how about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
hey, okay.
you are serious?
anything for a dear friend.
but i just met you.
but you are a friend of jimmy's. i think of you as a brother already.
so that is 40 lbs. at 6 a pound then?
if you say so.
pooh-bear, i do not mean to be rude, but i get the feeling you are not taking me seriously.
maybe you are the one who is not taking me seriously.
why do you say that?
i welcome you here with open arms and you got the nerve to low-ball me like some slick used car salesman.
hey, i was just trying to ...
i want to tell you about the last guy who tried to jam me up on a deal.
hey, i do not play that.
you want a hit?
no. I am good.
can i ask you something?
sure, jimmy.
what does j.f.k. stand for?
john fitzgerald kennedy.
was he the president?
yes, jimmy
danny?
yes, jimmy.
thanks for not laughing at me.
danny, listen up.  here's the deal ... my wife's pimp knows a guy who works at cedars sinai medical lab.  they are getting a very special delivery a week from this friday.
what is it, drugs?
better than drugs.
what is that? rum and coke?
do not worry about it.
i just want to be straight on the details.  can i taste it?
no, you can not taste it.  it is the fucking lab! now shut up.
jesus jimmy, you at the alpha team.
i thought you were done.
look...i'd like to help you out ... but i really do not want to get involved.
i understand. thanks anyway.
jesus, i look like a raccoon.
i was thinking alice cooper.
oh god.
come on, cheer up. it could be worse.
how?
i do not know .... you could be staking your financial future on stealing bob hope's stool specimen.
what about the guy on the very bottom?
leave me out of this.
that bad, huh?
could be worse.  oh sorry, forgot who i was talking to.
ouch.
do not worry, he is probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
this man sounds like a real catch.
oh, he is a keeper all right.
colette ...
what?
nothing.
go ahead.
look, it is really none of my business but why do not you just dump this guy?
it is not that easy.
do not tell me, down deep he is really not a bad person and you do not want to see him get hurt.
who the fuck are you, dr. joyce brothers?  i hate the son-of-a-bitch.
then leave.
i can't.
why not?
you do not understand.
there is nothing to understand. the guy is a pig.
i can not leave.
you get off on abuse or something?
fuck you.
then why do not you leave?  just give me one good reason.
because he will kill me.
why do not you call the cops?
why? they do not hold him for more than a day or two.
that is long enough to get out of town.
i can't. I have got a kid.  she lives with my parents.  quincey knows where they live.
then make sure he gets put away for longer.
how?
i wanna do a small buy first.  ten thousand.  we will see how it goes.
why? the guys is ready to deal now.
because i do not know him and i do not really know you, partner.
now that is down-right insulting.
I will have to live with that.  my money my risk, my rules.
i guess i do not have a hell of a lot of choice.
get used to it.  you are in a very tenuous position on the food chain, hoss.
you thinking what I am thinking?
yeah.  this could be the one we are looking for.
what the hell are you doing here?
question is, what are you doing here?
i was trying to score some dope.
cut the shit, flynne.
someone want to tell me what the hell is going on here?
okay, asshole, you wanna play, we will play.
you think this is funny motherfucker?
i can not help it, tanner, you hit like a fucking girl.
we know what is going on.
i still do not know what you are talking about.
jimmy?
who the hell is jimmy?
he is the only one i told.
and he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. you know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, flynne.  might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
i met the guy at a party.  he said he wanted to do a biggie. he is new in town so i offered my services.
this chink have a name?
bubba.
you better not be blowing smoke up my ass, flynne.
after that ass-whipping you gave me?
what is on the other end of this thing?
now that i can help you with. nasty boy ... goes by the name of pooh-bear. he is a chef. check with palmdale p.d. I am sure they are keeping box scores on the guy.
sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, flynne.
oh they are all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
what are your taking down?
standard vig.  minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of jimmy the finn, who is living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
look man, i just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  i did not want to wait around for domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
you have got no choice.
whata you mean I have got no choice?
well, if you would rather do a stretch in la casa grande ...
for that old possession charge? gimme a break.
no. you just handed us a new one.  we can go federal on your ass right now: ongoing criminal conspiracy. intent to buy and distribute $250,000 worth of crank.  what is the mandatory on that, al?
and believe me, word will get out that you are a pro rat.
that is not good in prison. it is just not good.
what is that smell?
that would be me.
what did you do, piss your pants?
hell, yes!  what the hell do you expect zapping mr. johnson with that crackler?
who would have thought it?  danny "chickenshit" flynne trying to go large right under our noses.
lay off, garcetti.  I am not in the mood.
no.  you have got me all wrong.  i mean, in you own pussified way, you actually got some nuts in your little sack.
bullshit. he is a liar.
news-flash, tanner. I am a fucking rat.
you think you are so god damned smart, do not you?
why did not you just ask for directions back there?
come on, where is your pioneer spirit?
you mean like the donner party?
hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  and if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
tom, quit fucking around.
okay, okay.  there is a house up there. I will go ask for directions.
you think that is a good idea?
what do you mean?
look at that place. it is creepy.
first you want me to ask for directions, then you don't.  which is it?
i wanted you to ask back there.  you know, before you got us lost.
just no pleasing you, is there?
just admit you are wrong.
we all know how much you like hearing that. okay, liz, i was wrong. there.  you happy?
quit feeling sorry for yourself, tom. it gets old.
no. you know what gets old? being reminded what a loser you are every time you screw up.
here it comes, poor tom.
but that is okay, liz, you are the one with the steady job, you pay all the bills. I am just an unemployed musician.  you have every right.
that is so unfair.
my sentiments exactly.
why are you doing this?
oh. hi.
what happened to your eye?
turns out I am allergic to steel-toed boots. go figure.  by the way, I am not looking for a matching set.  where is quincey?
do not worry. he is out of town.
how far out of town?
trust me. we are safe.
miles davis. "all blues."
never heard of him.
just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
like you?
nah. I am strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part.
dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. no false notes. always honest.
and you admire that?
it is the only way to play.
is that how you play?
i try.
: what are you up to?
nothing.
what do you want from me, colette?
i do not want anything. why are you so suspicious?
it gets me through the day.
you really need to lighten up.
look, i can not help you with quincey if that is what you are after.
this has nothing to do with him.
so you are just attracted to me, is that it?
yes. why do you find that so hard to believe?
how much time do you have?
what is wrong with you?
how much time do you have?
you have got a comeback for everything, do not you, danny? you use 'em like some sort of shield.
who the fuck are you? dr. joyce brothers?
there you go again. you are nothing but false notes.
you do not like the tune, find another station.
what are you hiding, danny?
therapy session is over.
you think you are the only one down here with a sad story?
no. but I am the only one with my sad story.  and that is how it is going to stay.
excuse me?
several possession charges, but nothing major.
why does not palmdale p.d. just raid the guy?
they have. but they never found a lab.
that is because he does not have one.
whata you mean?  he told me -
guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  as least that is what the word is.
what is to stop him from just ripping me off then?
that is probably what he would have done if we had not found out about your get-rich-quick scheme.
you are lucky, flynne.
funny, i do not feel lucky.
we are coordinating with palmdale p.d.. we will have your sorry ass covered.
what if he caps me before you can make a move?
golly, i had not thought of that.
do not we always take good care of you?
speaking of which ... you run that license plate for me?
you mean the menacing red car?
what? is it bad?
I am afraid so, danny.
who is it?
come on! who is it?  domingo's boys?
worse. much worse.  a teacher.
she is 57 and she is been teaching third grade for the last 33 years.
now that is scary!
when is the deal going down?
I am making the small buy tonight ... if i do not get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  if everyone is happy, we will do the big deal later in the week.
you want to do this some other time?
pull your pants down.
I am sorry?
pull your motherfucking pants down.
come on, guys ...
big bill.
pooh-bear. come on, man.  what is this?  it is me, danny. i thought we had a deal.
big bill
captain steubing thinks you might work for the police.
what?!
do not address me.  i did not make the accusation.
please .. i do not know what you are ...
uh-uh-uh ...
shoot him.
okay! okay!
now get talkin'
i did not fucking do anything! i swear to god!
can i pull my fucking dick out?!
yeah.
i ought to just call this whole thing off right now.
do not do that. please.  or I will kill you.  please, danny.
what the hell was that? who told you i was five-0?
no one. it was just a test. i need to be sure of who I am dealing with from time-to-time.
did it ever occur to you that someone might cop to something they did not do rather than have their balls chewed off by a rabid weasel?
I will keep that in mind.
we are in business.
good work, flynne.  you are a first-rate rat.
that is real sweet, garcetti.  thanks.
we got the 411 on your good old boy.
murder.  beautiful.
pumped fifty-seven bullets into a police informant.
you know, I am starting to think I would rather take my chances with domingo than go through any more of this shit.
did not you hear?  domingo's dead.
took a pig-slicker to the heart.
jesus.
i thought you would be happy.
yeah.
who is it?
it is tom.
all right, nancy, how did you track me down?
billy sutcliffe said he saw you at a bar down in gardena a few weeks ago. said you looked so bad, he barely recognized you.
closure? how do you find closure when her killers are still running around out there?
i found forgiveness in my heart for the people who killed my daughter. i gave my grief to jesus christ.
is that what you want me to do?  put it all on jesus?  let him sort it out in the afterlife?
you have got to deal with this sooner or later, tom. you can not keep hiding.
maybe i am dealing with it.
i know it is not my place to pass judgement on you but ...
then why do not i see any pictures of me up there?
that was my idea.
you never did like me much, did you verne?  and you can not stand it that i walked out of there alive and liz didn't. you think I am a coward, do not you?
I am genuinely happy that you found some peace, nancy. but you can not forgive for liz.  no one can.  and you can not forgive for me.
your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
i do not buy that. there is a place for hatred.  did you know that liz and i got into an argument the night she was killed? i acted like an ass and i never had a chance to apologize to her.  do you know what that feels like?
it is not too late to show her you are sorry.
how?
by not disgracing her memory!
what does that mean?
you might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose.  or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter?
you do not understand.
understand what?
who is it?
it is me.
I am kind of busy.
please open the door, danny.
we been through that.
what about a battered woman's shelter? you can move you kid in with you.
i need my paycheck.
you can still work.
he knows where i work.
find a new job.
it is not that easy. i just got a raise. i need the money.
you always been this stubborn?
from day one.  i was a breach birth. they tried for hours to turn my little butt around. but i would not let 'em.
ass first into the world.
i been that way ever since.
why not?
i just can't. okay?
what is wrong, danny?
look, maybe you oughta' leave.
no. i want to know what the hell is going on.
i can not tell you.
what you want to do is go back the way you came and make a left at the bottom. it will take you right to the highway.
that is it?
are you australian?
no.
good. i fucking hate australians.
you got a bathroom i can use before we hit the road?
yeah? first door on the right. it am not that dirty.  just kinda' filthy is all.
you mind?
no, i do not mind.  that is how come i told you about it.
i was talking to my wife.
no, you are wrong, i tried to tell myself the same thing but i could have gotten up. i could have done something.
they would have killed you too.
nothing could be worse then this slow death I am living now.
really, i do not want to.
i want to do this for you.  i want to do something good for a change.
what is it?
never mind. just do what i say. he holds out the baggie. colette backs away.
i do not want to.
will you do that?  then i want you to get out of the room.
why?
do not worry about it. just go across the street and watch. you will know when it is safe to go back.
what is this?
tem thousand dollars. everything i could spare.  it is for you.
but why? you only owe me five. and that is not till after we close the deal tonight.
you are not coming with me.
okay
wait till i tell you what it is.
it do not matter. I will do it. and you sure as hell do not have to pay me.
why?
you are my best friend, man. I would do anything for you.
jimmy, look, there is something i have to tell you.
hey, check it out...
what the hell is that?
it is you! i did not have a picture or nothin' so i had to describe you to the guy. not bad though, huh?
what?
I am not a tweaker.  i do not use drugs. i never had.
but...i've seen you.
when? when did you ever see me use?
this is not like that queen elizabeth question, is it?
you ever notice how i always showed up, in the middle of a binge? left before it was over? how i sneak away for cap-naps? how when the crank came around to me, i always said I would just done one?
no one ever noticed?
are you kidding me? a bunch of amped -out tweakers? it was easy.
but... why? why would you pretend?
i can not tell you.
you do not trust me?
i do not trust anybody.
and you want me to do you some big favor?
wait  if you do not trust me, why did you tell me that stuff about not using drugs?
because i do not want to see you end up like kujo and those other losers.  i thought that maybe if you knew that i did not use, you might see it in yourself to go clear.
i do not know... a little. i wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.
I am sorry. i couldn't.
nah... i want to keep it.  maybe i can use it for like, inspiration ...you know...like when i detox?
good for you jimmy.
would not be a favor if you were paying me. I will just take my five when the deal is done.
you are a good man. jimmy the finn.
yeah.
everything go?
yeah.
just make sure you come alone. this guy will not like any surprises
i am not a idiot, asshole.
I will see you tonight.
nervous?
with you clowns watching my back? what do you think?
just make sure you hit the floor when we come in. it could get ugly in there.
yeah, I would hate to shoot you by accident.
all i saw was the headlights. the high beams were on.
not even a guess?

yeah, but he was in silhouette.
how about in the house?
they were wearing ski masks. i told you all of this.
did you see his hair color?
no, why?
what is it?
nothing, I am trying to remember...
i knew that if these were the guys i was looking for, I would have to set up a deal so sweet, they would not be able to walk away from it.
that is when he called me. he told me his story and he pitched me a plan.
these guys are smart. i knew they would not hit a deal unless they knew all the players. i needed a big buyer.
how you holding up?
I am fine. little nervous...little disappointed that i did not finish this myself.
hey, you did the right thing. you would not have stood a chance against these boys by yourself. they have eaten your ass alive.
oh shit
what?
can you do me a favor? this girl i know, her boyfriend's a real piece of shit-dude's really jamming her up. i promised her I would try to help.
where is bubba?
maybe he is not showing.
what the hell is this?
just some buddies.
this is bullshit.  you did not say anything about anybody else being here.
what the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
cool it. we got business.
yeah, dickhead.
danny?
my name is tom.
whatever you say, man.  look ... can we talk about this?
yeah. okay. listen carefully ...  you are in the bathroom.  you have been shot in the shoulder ...
please ... do not do this ...
answer the fucking question!
you are good, princess. I will give you that.
danny, it is not what you think.
colette, go.
i do not want to leave you.
your daughter needs you.  go.
