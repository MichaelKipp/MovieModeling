geoff?  anybody see my boy?
right here, mom...
how long have you been here?
couple minutes. i saw the last shot. that was pretty cool.
how did it go with your father last night?
good. he said he would be over for dinner at eight...  i mean... he misses you, mom...
i miss him too...
i know, mom.
you know everything, do not you?
did she always have reporters following her around like this?
pretty much so.
i hear you moved into town.
i wanted to get geoff out of l.a. just start things over, you know?
that is renee alright.
i suppose so.
is something wrong?
uh... no. you just... look different than you sounded on the phone. please, come in.
I am real excited about working for you mr. matthews...
well we are glad to have you, marjorie. you can call me chase, by the way.
how long ago did this guy retire?
it is been a few years.
what is wrong?!
nothing. i just got spooked by a bunch of furballs.
what is his name?
zowie.
damn dog stuck his nose in on my rabbits and they ganged up on him. i swear that dog's an idiot.
is he gonna be okay?
when i was young i thought cats were the girls and dogs were the boys.
there are three more girls where that one came from looking for homes.
thee facial lacerations should heal up pretty quickly. I will give you som antibiotic cream--
--drew, he is your dog. are you listening to this?
i hear you have got marjorie hargrove working for you now.
how did you know that?
what is a lunch cost these days? you want ten?
sure.
you nervous? new town, new school. i know it must be pretty hard for you...
I will be fine, dad.
I have never seen anybody punch clyde before.
he pissed me off.
sorry about your mom.  i could not handle not having my mom around. just having gus...
i swear, sometimes i wish gus was dead...
you should not ever say that about your parents, not even your dad.
stepdad. gus is my stepdad.
what was all that stuff about dead people coming back to life?
nothing. it is just an old ghost story. let's get out of here...
hey! how was your first day at school?
it sucked.
drew, i do not remember inviting zowie in for dinner.
just until he heals up?
not that much appreciation. i thought we were gonna tone down that flabby ass.
hey, I am so sorry I am not the stud that you are.
is this a good spot?
I am not burying him here...
why not?
there is a better place...
this is it... i was not sure if it even really existed.
what did?
the old indian burial ground.
come on, that is just a bullshit story. you said so yourself...
what if it is not bullshit? if i bury zowie there, and it works...  ...he'll come back alive.
drew, i know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you are freaking me out.
look, if there was even one chance in a million it would work, would not you want to try?
you want me to help?
you have to bury your own. that is the way the indians did it. it is like a rule...
I have never had anyone die before...  ...but i guess you get over it. i mean, eventually...
you never get over it.
it is getting pretty late. we better go.
yeah...
your momma's worried sick over you. you take off in the middle of the night, you do not show up for school. what are you trying to prove?
I am not trying to prove anything.  i was burying my dog.
zowie...
say your goodbyes. zowie's going outside. you are grounded, buddy. that is the new law.
what?
you alright?
i think so.
your mom and i loved each other, geoff. do not ever think that we didn't.
i still can not believe she is dead...
who was that?
remember zowie, drew's dog? he got hurt again. I am going over to take a look at him.
maybe he was not dead when we buried him.
he was dead. you know he was.
you think my dad'll figure out why he is not getting better?
you think he would believe it if he did?
how can he not have a heartbeat?
maybe it takes a while...
hey! where are you off to?
I am going out, dad!
out?
he is probably going up to the pet sematary. kids've been going out there on halloween night for years.
what do they do up there?
oh, you know... drink beer, tell ghost stories. they try and spook each other out, talking about zombies and things...  it is no big deal, chase. i did it when i was young.
just out.
"out." well that is great, geoff.  look, I have been letting you get away with a lot these past few weeks, but I am not going to stand for crap like this. i do not care if it is halloween... it is a school night, and if you do this again...
I am really tired, dad... can i just go to sleep?
it is weird...
what do you mean?
it is like he is not gus anymore. he is different. you know, like zowie...
what?
i do not know what you expected to find, matthews. there is nothing wrong with the antigens, nothing to indicate an unusual death...
wait, there must be some mix-up. he was... the dog is alive.
not this dog. there was not enough oxygen in those red cells to pump life into a flea.
you took over for doctor yolander?
yes... why?
because the last person that sent me blood from a dead animal was yolander...
why are you bothering me about this? can not you leave it be?
i... um...
...the pathologist... he said that you had reported a similar incident... with a cat...
the creed cat, that is right. bastard's name was "church".  let me guess. your dog's tissue is not healing, pupils are not dilating... maybe you can not find a heartbeat?
exactly! i thought it might be some sort of blood condition... immune deficiency or...
you want some advice, friend? you get in your car, you pick up your family... and you get the hell out of that town.
well... uh... thanks...
what was that all about? you think he is trying to scare us?
i do not know but I am not taking any chances...
what happened to you?
i had a little run-in with zowie.
you sure did...
i hope he does not have rabies.
he doesn't. i do not know what he has, but I am hoping to god it is not infectious...
do you think everyone that came back would be like gus?
i do not know...  ...maybe it depends on what you were like before you...
dies?
i gotta go back and do my chores...
go later...
you ever think about running away?
all the time.
geoff, dinner's ready!  geoff?!
I am not hungry.
what are you talking about?
i can bring her back. the same way drew and me brought zowie back...
geoff, this is crazy. zowie did not die.
he did. we buried him.  there is a place out in the woods... if you bury something there, it comes back alive.
believe what you saw, matthews. the dog was dead.
my god...  ...how is that possible? you have to help me, doctor yolander. i do not know what I am dealing with here! they have dug up my wife...
i was building a doggy door.
god damn it gus, you dug up my wife! what the fuck is going on around here?!
mom...
i came back for you, geoff. we are going to be together again.
all set?
all set.
so where are we going?
anywhere but here.
