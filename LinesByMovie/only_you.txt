I am not pushing it.
wait.  i have to write this down.
yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? like, what if he was a cave man, and now he is dead?
do not be stupid, larry.  if he is my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
yeah, but, what if he does not live here?  like, what if he is a cannibal in new guinea or something?
if i live here, then he lives here. fate would not make a mistake like that.  and stop talking.  you are going to ruin the spell.
we will know.
okaaaaayyyy.
i do not know, i guess i never really thought about it...  is larry here?
yeah.  he is around somewhere.
i do not believe in statistics.
you are an accountant for cryin' out loud.
what about that guy you work with, mike what's-his-name?
no.  he smokes.
how about the other one?  his friend.
just moved in with his girlfriend.
how about that guy at the bank?
scientologist.
oh.
so, you got to be a little flexible. look at your brother and me. larry's not perfect, neither am i.  but we work it out.  we are not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  i think you have got the door number three syndrome.
do not tell me, oprah did a show--
i do not have an amana freezer.
it is a metaphor.  it is women who always think there is some unknown out there that is going to be better than what is in front of them.  and instead wind up with nothing.
metaphorically, i still do not have an amana freezer.
i think if you are honest with yourself, you will admit you have had a chance at a number of amana appliances in your lifetime.
kate, you are still there?  i thought you would be on your way home by now.
you miss me?...
uh, yeah.  sure.  honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
no, why?
well, there is nothing here to eat.
is everything okay?
yes.  you know all the shrinks on donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
but somebody wrote those songs.
so, what is your point?
just that they came out of somebody is experience is all.
no, faith.  they came out of somebody is imagination.
i wish you did not have to go so early.
yeah, well, larry and his friends are hungry.  and i did say I would try to pick something up.
no.
is he married?
no.
is he gay?
i do not know.  i do not think so.
so?...
so, he is not my type.  let me walk you to the elevator.
what is he do?
i do not know, kate.
you do not have any idea?
he is a podiatrist or something.
"thrills"?  that is what you are waiting for?  you know how long that lasts?  besides, how do you know?  have you ever been out with him?
no.  he is never asked me.
why do not you ask him?
why should i ask someone out who i do not want to go out with in the first place?
if you have never been out with him, how do you know you do not want to go out with him?
this is the last one before the wedding, right?
right.
and we did not have to bring another present?
no.
not only is it tacky, it is exploitation.
it is not exploitation.  these people wanna sell and i wanna buy. how are golf clubs exploitation?  she takes one night class and suddenly she is a socialist.
sociologist.  and because.  pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  they are all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they were not desperate for the money.
we are all desperate for the money, doll.  that is what made this country great.  back me up on this candy, am i right?
do not call me doll, larry.  i hate it when you call me doll.
you used to love it when i called you doll.
you said it differently then.
he begged me to marry him.  i did not even want to marry him.
yes you did.
well, i wouldn't've if i had not thought i was in love.
come on, it is not so bad.
look how big it makes me look.  i look like an alp.
i think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
i know...  it was.
but what?
oh, i do not know.  i guess it is just not quite the way i always thought it was going to be.  you know, like in the movies.
that is the problem.  when you are a kid you think life is going to be like the movies.  dreams come true, the good guys win, people live happily ever after... all that crap.  turn.
but one day you wake up and realize you have been had.  of course life is not like the movies.  that is why there are movies.
yeah.  i guess you are right.  i really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
let me tell you something about love.  there are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  love is hard work.
i know.  you are right.
people have problems, insecurities, flaws-- and you have to learn to compromise, to overlook, to forgive.  it is not settling, faith, it is life.  real life.
i understand, kate.  what do you think of this garter?
i mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it is all supposed to be perfect?  well, guess what?... it isn't.  not for you, not for anybody.
kate, is something the matter?
larry brought me flowers last night.
is that bad?...
i think he is having an affair.
have you seen him with someone?
no...  i can just tell.
after all, he is my brother, and i know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes, but i know him pretty well, and i really do not think--
hello?  is anybody there?
dwayne pinsley?  I am trying to reach dwayne pinsley.
he is not in at the moment.  can i take a message?
who is this?
this is his fiancee.  who is this?
oh, hi.  I am an old high school buddy of dwayne's.  i was in town this weekend, was hoping to stop by and surprise him. but I have got to catch a plane so I am afraid I am not going to be able to make it.
I am sure he will be sorry to hear that.  who should i tell him called?
my name's
i can hardly hear you.  could you spell that?
damon bradley...
right.  thanks a lot.  and congratulations.  it is not easy finding love these days.
wait!!  where are you?
I am at the airport.  why?
uh-- in case dwayne wants to try to reach you.
well, he would have to hurry.  my flight leaves at four o'clock.
where are you going?
I am on my way to venice.  why?
venice?  i love venice.  with the boats, right?...
huh?  uh, yeah-- I have got to run. tell dwayne hi.  maybe someday we can all get together.
it is a miracle.
it is a coincidence.
the woman at my dry cleaners believes there is no such thing as coincidence.
may i see your boarding pass, please?
i-- i must have misplaced it.
I am sorry, but without a boarding pass we can not let you on the plane.
great.  because, like i said, until you find it, we can not let you on the plane.
you do not understand.  the man I am supposed to marry is on that plane.
okay, ma'am, just a moment.
it was my new year's resolution to overcome it.
but it is july.
it is still the new year...
what about your job?
i have vacation time coming to me.
you do not have a passport.
that is where you are wrong.  i got one nine years ago.  i just never had an opportunity to use it.
because you were afraid to fly.
would you stop saying that?  i need you to do me a really big favor.
does dwayne know about this?
of course not.  i told him i was going to visit a great aunt.  and do not tell larry, either.
i can not believe we did this.  do i have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
look, i know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person.
no, i haven't.  and you forgot about the fortune teller.
my god, you have...
thank you so much.
you are just going to fly to italy and start combing the streets?
he was on his way to venice, right? i called the tourist bureau and i must have called every hotel in the city, but i found where he is staying.
a foreign land full of millions of italian men...  speaking italian with italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
how hard can it be?  I will land there, I will go to his hotel, I will introduce myself, and--
live happily ever after.
maybe.
i keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
you are coming with me?
you okay?
sure.  I am fine.  i do not know why i never did this before.  i mean, what is the big deal?
now what do we do?
the book said they have boats that are like taxis...  vaporettos.  what is the name of the place we are staying again?
it is called... the gritty palace.
"gritty"?  is this going to be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who do not believe in deodorant?
i do not know...  maybe.  think of it as an adventure.
this is a lifestyles hotel.
what?
"of the rich and famous".  of which we are neither.  are you out of your mind?  we can not afford this.
are you sure?
yes.  cathy lee crosby stayed here.
well, we are here.  and more importantly, he is here.  we will cut back on everything else.
you ask what room he is in, okay?
buona notte.
excuse me?
mr. bradley left about a half hour ago.  he said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
he could not have checked out-- i was supposed to meet him here.
I am very sorry.  perhaps you misunderstood?
nobody here has any idea which way he went?
once they pay the bill, we do not usually follow them.
i can not believe we came all this way and he is gone.
you gave it your best shot.  you tried.
we lost him?...
I will never meet the man of my dreams.
you and the other 99% of the women in the world.
just once more, so you will be sure to know what to look for.
faith, I have seen it already, okay? if i spot somebody who is got a head that is an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I will recognize him from the photo. otherwise, I am telling you, it is not going to do me any good.
what are you doing?
he fell out.
you can not really blame him for being upset.  it was an armani suit.
did i or did i not offer to have it cleaned?
i do not think he understood what you were saying.  what is the airport number?
i just got a dial tone--
the guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
so?
so, maybe his room has not been cleaned yet.  maybe there is something in there that might help us.  maybe they will let us go in and take a look around.
ah ha!...
what did you find?
a butterfinger wrapper.
a rich, possibly fat, slob.
maybe there is fingerprints on it?
we are not looking to arrest the man, faith, we are trying to locate him.
oh.  right.
we are saved!
what is it?
a phone message.  only--
only what?
only, it is in italian...
no...  it is just very important that i find him, okay?
why?
because.
your brother?
what was i gonna do?  tell him the truth?
he said he thinks a woman he works with knows him.  her name's anna. but she will not be in 'til tomorrow.
so.  how do we get to rome?
could not we just have taken a train?
the book said they have a lot of rail strikes in italy.
i told you a liter was less than a gallon.
we would have had enough gas to get us there if you had not gotten us lost.  besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
right.  so we should have been able to cover more of them.
I am hungry.
you know, no offense or anything kate, but i think I am starting to see larry's side of the story.
what is that supposed to mean?...
nothing.
you expecting somebody you know?
well, you do not have to get snippy with me.
sorry.
so, what exactly is larry's side of the story, anyway?
i do not know, kate.  i just said that.  I am sorry.  I am just on edge.  I am afraid we are losing him.
you think he misses me at all?
'course he does.
you know, when larry and i got married, i thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. people talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to?  but maybe i was wrong.  maybe sooner or later everything wears out.
that was a long time ago.
and you know what i thought then, kate?  i thought, i hope someday i have somebody who loves me that much.  i still hope that.
he went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  did i tell you that?
larry bought himself cologne?
polo.
i do not get it.  she has not seen her since she was a kid, now just because she is dying, all of the sudden she is got to see her again?
she is been acting weird lately, though.  i shoulda seen it coming. babbling on and on and on about "communication".  like i do not know how to communicate.
let's face it.  sooner or later we all die.
exactly.
who is dying?
your great aunt.
what great aunt?
and you are?...
kate.
you are looking for a place to stay, no, kate?
no.  well, i do not know.  well, maybe.  later.
this is your most lucky day.  my family runs a pension not three blocks from here.
anna, I am faith.  you do not know how happy i am to meet you.  you see, I am trying to find someone, and--
her brother.
right.  my brother.
what did you say to her?
i do not know.  i just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
what is she saying?
my friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  can you tell us what she is saying?
she is saying he is a-- a--  porco.
a porco?
a pig!  a pig!  she is saying he is a pig.
a very large pig.
ask her if she knows where he is?
sa dov'e' lui?
no.
ask her if she knows how i might reach him?  if she has a telephone number?
ha un numero di telefono?
...has a prior commitment.
what is mezzaluna?
a restaurant.  in piazza navona.
that is it.  that is it.  that is all i need to know.  bless you, thank you, thank you.
all of the sudden, I am feeling kind of nervous.  god, i hate blind dates.  why could not we just have arranged marriages in america?
you are right.  at least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  smile.
i sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he would notice me first?
you have travelled over six thousand miles and now you are going to play hard to get?
so what is in a name?  i wanna join him.  i do not see why we can not join him.
i told you.  if he sees me here with another guy, he is going to think I am here with another guy.  i just do not want to send any confusing signals.
well, how come we are always looking for guys for you?
because I am the one who is single.
i never even got to be single.
sure you did.
not if you do not count the sixth grade.
okay, okay.  you join him.  but first will you ask if he is here?
he is heeeeeerrre...
oh my god.  where?
he is sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  he is wearing a navy jacket.  if you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
is he looking at us?
nope.
right, right...  okay..  you do not think he is going to think I am too aggressive?
faith.  so far you have trailed the man halfway around the globe.  at this point, i do not think another fifteen feet is going to tip the scales.
right.  okay...  it is meant to be right?  this is it.
faith--
what?
good luck.
well, nobody can say we did not try.
okay, here's what i think.  we find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in rome, we could narrow it down and--
and then what, faith?
and then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
that was really sweet...
i meant about my idea.
i think it is time we got some professional help.
like a detective.
no... like a psychiatrist.
do not be silly.  how is a psychiatrist going to find him?
so, what is the story with your friend?
my friend has lost her fucking mind...
what is she doing?
she is trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
what for?
so she can drive through the streets of rome paging the man of her dreams.
no, really.  what is she doing?
really.  she thinks he is here. even though she is never met him. even though she is never laid eyes on him.
seriously.
were they pen pals?
no.
is he some kind of celebrity or something?
no.
did he do some anonymous good deed for her?
there is this poem by rilke, i do not remember the whole thing, but it is about that.  about waiting for that person, and wondering if you will ever find them.  and the last line of it goes, "who knows?  perhaps the same bird echoed through both of us, yesterday--
--separate, in the evening..."
yes.
my hair's kind of a mess, is not it?
your hair... is perfect.
you do not think this is just infatuation, do you?
oh no.  do you?
no.
but...  just to be sure, maybe we ought to shatter each other's unrealistic images of perfection. you know, each of us admit something embarrassing about ourselves.
okay.  good idea.  you first.
I am a liberal!
no...
my car bumper has never held a winning sticker.
he is your husband, no?
yes, but...  he was having an affair.
si.
she was your sister.
no, she was not my sister.
your mother.
of course not.
your grandmother?
look, she was not a relative, okay? i do not know who she is.
what?...
i feel like I have been wandering in the desert for as long as i can remember.  with nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  and suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I have found the oasis.
there is one other thing you should know about me.
nothing you could say would change the way i feel.
I am engaged.  I am supposed to be married in two days.
except possibly that.
and, he is a friend of yours.  it is dwayne.
dwayne?
dwayne pinsley.  from high school. that is how i knew you were here. when you called, from the airport.
oh, right.  dwayne.  you are engaged to dwayne?
it just happened.  i did not plan it.  i was alone.  and he was... there.  but now everything's changed.  i owe it to him to let him know.  i need to tell him.
you are sure...
I have never been more sure of anything in my life.
good.
let's find a telephone.
sure-- but, before you do that, since we are putting all our cards on the table, i have a confession to make, too.
do not be afraid.  you can tell me.
you are sure...
we found each other, did not we?
yes.  we did.
it is alright...  this is our destiny.
what?
my name is not damon bradley.  i just told you it was damon bradley.
what is it?
that is not the point.
you said whatever it was you would understand.
that was before i found out what it was.
how could you do this to me?
I am in love with you.
oh, come on...  what kind of an excuse is that?
yeah.  sociopaths.  they are able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
but how could he know?  he only just met me.
men have ways.
i have to talk to her.
she is not here.
where is she?
she went out to check into skywriting.  i can not believe you lied.  is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
no!  that is not fair.  that is not it at all.  look, something somewhere got screwed up.  maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed.  i may not have the right name, but i was there.  I am the guy.  i'm-- skywriting??
it was an emergency.  i only lied that night because it was the only way i knew to stop her.  i knew if i didn't, I would never see her again.
good strategy.
do you know i was not even supposed to be in rome?  my boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles.  the measles. who gets the measles at forty-three?  so they sent me. and i was not supposed to be in that piazza that night either.  I would gone to the movies, only it was sold out.  so i was wandering around. just wandering...  when i got hit in the head with this shoe.
and then i saw her.  and all i know is, when i looked in her eyes i saw something... light.  and life and passion and yearning.  and something else i can not even put my finger on, something I would never seen before--
mania.
whatever.  and i thought, please god, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever.  and he did. she told me the name.  granted, it was not my name, but it was a start.
and if that is not destiny, i do not know what is.
that is really romantic.
i mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
ten billion to one.
oh.
giovanni, this is faith's friend, peter.
oh, hello.  i just came by to see if you wanted to join me for a drink, but--
I would love to.
it is siesta.
oh.
you see, in america they care for work, they live to work.  but in italy, they care for food, for love, for pleasure...
how old are you?
what do the years matter?  I have known you for centuries...
hi-iii...
hi.  where have you been?
sightseeing...  what are you doing?
packing.
why?
because I have been kidding myself. because i realized you were right from the beginning.  this whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
so, you have had a little bad luck.
a little bad luck?
okay, a lot of bad luck.  but that means the odds are probably in your favor now.  this is no time to give up.
why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  children are very impressionable, you know.
so you are just quitting?  just like that?
i thought you were the one who did not think i should have come in the first place.
i know, but...
it was a ouija board, remember?
...and a fortune teller.
yeah, well, obviously it was not meant to be.  I have got forty-eight hours.  i can still make it home in time to marry dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
what about peter?...
peter?  peter was a mistake.  an imposter.
the last dead end in a long series of dead ends that i am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  may as well start packing, our cab's going to be here in an hour.
who said i was going?
what?
I am just not ready to go home quite yet, that is all.
no.  no, you go ahead.
you sure you will be okay?
I am sure.  and kate, thank you for coming.  thank you for being such a good friend.
I will be back before you leave.
you are limping.
i know I am limping.  i stubbed my toe.
are you okay?  you want some help?
no.
you are leaving, are not you?
why can not you just tell me?
if it is any of your business, yes.
yes?!  to be married, i suppose.
yes.
to the foot doctor.
yes.
because i know who dwayne is, and he is reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
he is safe.
so?!  is there something wrong with loving somebody who is safe?
does he love you?
he wants to marry me, does not he?
you did not answer my question.
why are you asking me this?
because I would like to think at least one of you feels that way.  does he  know who you are?
you stubbed your toe, do not you think that is a sign?
what?
he is a podiatrist.  pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong.  your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.
there must be something i can do, something i can say to make this up to you?...  just tell me what it is, I will say it.  I will do it. i do not want you to hate me.
look, peter, i do not hate you. but what we had was an illusion. mutual wishful thinking.  we both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
so?
so it was not real.
what about the oasis in the desert? are you telling me that was a lie?
no, that was not a lie.  that was...  a mirage.
do not you see?..  we are not the ones who are meant to be.  you are the man of somebody else's dreams.
because i do not have the right name?!
fine.  okay.  forget me.  leave me out of it.  but do not go throwing your life away on somebody you do not love.
who says i do not love him?...
why not?
because.  i know where he is.
i went back to that restaurant and i spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel.  so, i called there, they said he left yesterday.  but, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route.  he always goes from here down the coast to the le sirenuse hotel in positano.  i called.  and they told me he is checked in.
where is positano?
it is in the south.  I have still got my rental car.  i can get you there by morning...
oh no, i do not think that would be a good idea.
look, i know there is no going back for us.  that is not it.  i just want to make this up to you.  clear my relationship karma.  and i know the area, I have got some cousins down there.  please.  let me do this for you.  let this be my gift to you.
why?
because-- i want you to be happy.
peter found him?
yes.  is not that amazing?
amazing...
he is down in someplace called positano.  peter says we can make it there by morning.
the guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
he likes to read...  did he mention anyone in particular?
uh, I would rather not say.
tell me.
I would really rather not say.
please.  i need to know.
mickey spillane.
mickey spillane?
or hustler.
joan collins stayed here.
is damon bradley here?
he is out by the pool right now.
right now?
oh, and i forgot to tell you.  he is here with his mother.
that is the guy you have been waiting for all these years?
are not you going to go introduce yourself?
do you want me to do it?
no.
you are damon bradley?
uh huh.
whatareyoudoing?!
what if he does not like me?
it means you are a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
my god... you are right.
faith, I am kidding.  is this how you plan to get what you want from life?  when you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?
hello.
beautiful place...
sure is.
been here long?
just since yesterday.
i just got here, too.  not yesterday.  but, just now.  today. just a few minutes ago.  yeah, we just got here...  i mean, i just got here.  I am single.
i was wondering...  do you have dinner plans?
tonight?
any night.
well, not exactly...
would you be willing to have dinner with me?
sure.
you would?  really?
I will look forward to it.
okay.  good.  see you then, then.
wait.
yes?
are not you going to tell me who you are?
oh, faith.  my name's faith.
it is a pleasure to meet you, faith.
oh, it is you.  it is only peter.
thanks.
sorry...
hi, peter.
hi.
so.  you found him.
you found him.  i do not know how to thank you.
well, it looks like we both lucked out.  i just met somebody myself. somebody my aunt introduced me to.
oh.  that is nice.
yeah.
and she is a knock-out, too.
well, good.  good for you.
anyway, that is why i came by.  i need to fix this button.  do you have a needle and thread?
where are you going?  just-- out of curiosity...
just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  nothing fancy.
oh, thanks.  well, have a good time.
you too.
hey--
what?
nice dress.
thank you, peter.  thank you so much.
sure.
brunello di montalcino, '85, please.
you know, i noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke.  i could sense the chemistry between us.
really?
really...
well, to-- new friends.
and more...
excuse me?
nothing.  prices are a little steep here, are not they?
do not worry about it.  you are my guest.
what looks good?
hmmmm... well, the scampi sounds good...
you like shrimp?  i like shrimp.
what?...
what are you doing here?
we were hungry.
so what do you think?
uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
faith, this is my mother.
oh, hello.
mommy, this is faith.
so, you say you have been to italy before?
a few times.  it is kind of an annual tradi--
you were saying...
boy, that looks tasty.  what is that?
say, i saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. why do not we all go for an evening cruise around the bay?
i do not know if that is such a--
why are you doing this?
i just wanted to keep an eye on you.  the guy's a total stranger, remember?
so were you.
exactly.  besides, no hard feelings.  you found somebody.  i found somebody. i thought we could double.
kate.  thank god you are there. i need help.
uh huh...  okay, we will be there. how is he, anyway?
not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".
no one's perfect, kate.
and he is living proof.
no, i think maybe you have been right.  i think i may have been too critical in the past.
maybe i can change him.
i thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you would not need to change.
maybe if i kiss him I will feel it.
or maybe it will turn him back into a toad.
well, what about books?  you like hemingway?  you gotta love hemingway.
the sun also rises.  for whom the bell tolls.  the old man and the--
how about music?  you like classical?
the boston pops.  season tickets.
well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? like audrey hepburn.
actually, i think i prefer katherine hepburn.
so, what are we waiting for?
what?
let's face it.  you want me.
he is a jerk.
yes.  he is.
i spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
yup.
i came all the way to italy in search of a weasel.
when you could have found one in america.
you okay?
yeah.
i guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
I am sorry.
i feel like the world's biggest idiot.
yeah.  well, was the least i could do.
no, it was more than that.  it was very generous of you.  it was very kind.
promise me you will not leave without saying goodbye.
no.  course not.
so...
so.  i guess I have got a wedding to go to.
giovanni, i want to thank you.
i thank you.
no, you do not understand.  it is been wonderful meeting you.  but... i have a husband.  i have two kids at camp.  i have a life i have to go back to.
you do not have to go if you do not want to...
but i do want to.
you think I am just one of those italian casanovas.  the guys who try to seduce every woman who comes their way.  who prey on unhappily married women.  who lure unsuspecting--
giovanni.
huh?
that is exactly what you are.
kate is that you?
uh huh.
i did not expect you back so soon.
well, i realized, if you are getting married, you are going to be needing the maid of honor, right?
actually, no.  there is not going to be a wedding.
oh.
well... i ought to be getting home anyway.  the kids'll be back from camp soon.  the house is probably a mess.
and larry?...
what about larry?
i do not know.  I have just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
hi.
hi.  are you... busy?
no.  are you are leaving?
no.  i just came by to apologize.
it seems like ever since i found out about this guy, this name, I have been kind of crazy.  like i was on drugs or something.
i know the feeling.
yeah...  well, anyway, i also wanted to tell you, I am not getting married.
you aren't?
no.  i mean yes, I am not.  i decided to call it off.  well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
well.  congratulations.
thank you.  so, since i have a few more days of vacation left, i was wondering if maybe you would want to do something sometime.  i mean, you know, if you do not have... other plans.
are you asking me out?
yes.  i am.
in that case... no...
you can not come to southern italy and not see the blue grotto.
i just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
okay.  I will meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
is something the matter?
get out!!
I would call that a yes.  do i get a hint?
you want a hint?  I will give you a hint.  you are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
there is no such thing.
what?
reptilian swine.  there is no such thing.  reptiles are not swine.
who cares?!  you hired an actor??
i do not know what you are talking about.  who told you that?
no one had to tell me.  he is starring in the local play.
alright.  the truth is... i thought we had something here.
i can not believe you did that!
and i can not believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you have never even met destroy it.
you are the reason i never met him. you knew it was the thing i most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
i sabotaged it?  you are the one who lost him, remember?
well, i might have found him again if i had not left rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
as i recall, you were on your way home.  and i did not want you to go so, yes, i told you a little white lie.
a "little white lie"?  a "little white lie"?
what would you call it?
i would call it-- unforgivable.
do not you think you are overreacting just a little here?   we are talking about love, okay?  let's be rational.
rational?!  love is not rational! are you crazy?
yes.  I am crazy.  you have driven me crazy.  no one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you.  did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up?  how many arrangements had to be made? how many players had to be coordinated?
gee, I am flattered.  what an incredibly romantic gesture. cancel the roses, I have decided to lie to her instead.
very funny.
no, it isn't.  i called off my wedding all because of you.
really?...
yes.
and this is the thanks i get.  i did you a favor.  you never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
that is not the point.  and what if i had wanted to?
if you had wanted to, you would have gone home.
look, i just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you would be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  granted, ideally, me.  i did not do it to hurt you.  i did it for you.  i did it for us...
there is no us.
you...
hi there...
before you start picking your nose, i know he put you up to it.
it was the moth stuff that gave it away, did not it?  i knew that was too much.
no, you gave a very convincing performance.  and you will be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
my picture's up?
congratulations.
thanks.
so, this is what you do?  i mean when you are not playing other parts?
i take it things did not work out between the two of you?
it is an amazing place, do not you think?
amazing.
smoking or non-smoking?
non.  please.
lots of history.  for example, did you know, according to legend, this coastline used to harbor sirens?
hm.
beautiful women who could lure men to their destruction with their singing.  nobody's ever really seen them and lived to tell about it. but, i do not know.  an awful lot of ships wrecked on those rocks.
damon bradley?  that is why you are here?
what?  you know him?
it was just a joke.  i was pushing the arrow.  i wanted to get to the next question.  i wanted to find out who was gonna win the series.
are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  the guy never even existed?
he existed.  he was some kid i knew from little league.  he was a real jerk.  you say he is a friend of dwayne's?
went to high school with him. but...
i thought she would get a kick out of it.
it was a harmless little prank. who in the world would have thought she would spend her life waiting for this guy?
larry, you have got to tell her.
i can not tell her.  she is called off her wedding.  she will never speak to me again.
larry!  what are you doing here?  mom sent you.
no.
i came after the woman i love.
he missed me.
I am fine.  have you seen peter?
he is gone.  he told me what happened.  he just left for the airport.
larry, did you rent a car?
yeah--
faith.  larry has something he wants to tell you about damon bradley.
larry, can i borrow your car keys?
faith, this guy you think is mr. right, he's... not what you think--
do not worry, it is a long story, but i know who he is.  i know where to find him.
but, faith--
please, larry.  i have to hurry.
I will bring it back as soon as i can.
but faith--
what?...
she what?!
she said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
and you did not tell her?
she did not give me a chance.
you did not have that with you before.  prima non l'aveva con se.
it was late in arriving.  but it is here now.
i was hoping for the real thing.
i brought you that, too.
