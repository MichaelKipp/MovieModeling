can i call you at the office?
what do you want to call me at the office for?
i don't know. i just thought i might want to call you. i don't know.
i won't be at the office except to sign in.  i've got a lot of claims to check out. all over the place. garages and more garages.  i'll come home right after work.
and that was her. annabelle horse... field.
far as i know, yeah, that was her.
is that the man who called you up here?
yeah, that's dr. st. luc. he's the head of our little medical clinic here.
medical clinic?
yeah. this is an island, you know? takes too long to get into the city. we gotta have everything right here or somebody complains.
well, let's go talk to your doctor.
dr. st. luc? detective-sergeant heller. i'd like to ask you a few questions.
sure.
you're the one who found the bodies?
yes.
did you touch anything? move anything before we got here?
no, nothing.
you knew these people?
i knew the man, emil hobbes, a doctor and a professor at university. i saw the girl around the building but i didn't know her. she never came to the clinic.
so you just came up to visit this hobbes and you found them like that?
oh, no. i haven't seen dr. hobbes since i was in medical school. he taught me... he was my prof in urology and... i think he conducted a few seminars in psychopharmacology. that was it. i had no idea he'd ever set foot in starliner towers until today.
i see. then what brought you up here?
it was very strange. he called me at six this morning. hobbes called me. i thought i was dreaming. i haven't heard that voice for so long. he told me who it was, then he said something like, 'meet me at apartment 1208 at noon. i want you to go out for lunch with me. it's time you furthered your education.' then he laughed and hung up. i went back to sleep. he called me again at eight to remind me to come.
how did he sound this time? was he nervous? depressed?
he sounded fine.
not exactly the kind of lunch hobbes would have laid on you, rog, but it's all i got, and...  ...all i got i share with you. go ahead. take all you want.
you touch my spleen, rollo.  and here all the time i was thinking -- if i ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's rollo. he's in vd and he's happy.
i'm still a vd man under the skin, rog. you know me. i'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
well, at least you still talk the same.
so who changes?
but you gave up your private practice. suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
that was my father's idea... private practice. he wanted to set me up -- i couldn't say no. but he's dead now. and me, i'm still a snoop, i gotta do research. look at that beautiful stuff...  ...lookit it!
i know. you're bored already. transplants are yesterday's kishkas, right?
did i say anything?
look. you got men, you got parasites that live in, on, and around men. now. why not breed a parasite that does something useful? eh? why not breed a parasite capable of taking over the function of any one of a bunch of human organs? why not, for example, a parasite living in the human abdominal cavity that plugs into the circulatory system and filters the blood like a kidney? if it takes a little blood for itself, so what? be generous! you can afford it.
you put the bug into the body of a man with a diseased kidney, the bug attacks the bad kidney, dissolves it, it's assimilated by the body, and now you got a perfectly good parasite where you used to have a rotten kidney. i know what you're gonna say. you're gonna say it's crazy.
it's crazy.
right. it's crazy. but here's the beauty part. ready?  who cares?
i don't get it.
you know and i know that hobbes was a lousy teacher, eh? lousy. dry, academic, afraid of women, lousy. but he was always a genius at one thing -- getting grants. could he get grants for crazy projects?
rog, i gotta talk serious to you. really. listen. ya listening? ok. i want you to come into this with me. to tell the honest-to-god truth, i'm lonely.  all hobbes ever did was run around getting money and phone me in the middle of the night. he wanted you in anyway. that's why we were gonna get together, the three of us. we would have enough to keep us going for at least five years, even with inflation.
rollo, you know me. once a gp, always a gp.
you want to help sick people for the rest of your life? god forbid i should talk you out of it.
you oughta be careful yourself. might end up cutting your throat.
it was women did it to hobbes. couldn't handle them. that girl, that annabelle -- talk about crazy projects.
who was she?
aw, he met her when he was lecturing at some private girls' school. they caught him examining her little tits for breast cancer in the faculty lounge. she was twelve. don't ask. it was craziness, believe me.  they used to come here sometimes.  don't ask.
but you'll think about what i said about working together, huh?
ok. i'll think about it.
you say something?
nope. damned thing wriggled out of my hands. that's all.
...probably nothing at all. it's probably just a bunch of, i don't know, fatty cysts. you can have them removed in a doctor's office. has nick seen a doctor?
he hates doctors. doctors and lawyers. he never goes to doctors.
well, look. how's this? you go on down to the clinic and tell that nice dr. st. luc...  ...you tell him that nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. tell him to come when you're sure nick'll be home. and don't tell nick anything. let the two of them fight it out.
he'll be really mad.
so? you'll find out what's wrong and then you'll be able to relax a little bit. let him be the uptight one for a change.
mrs. ementhal's ready and waiting, doctor.
mm? ok. be with you in a sec.
want me to breathe deeply?
just breathe normally.
good shape for an old man, eh?
mr. parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
she had a couple just like them. right here near her belly button. you could push 'em around. i thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
didn't seem worried about them.
was this girl from starliner towers?
yep. she lived in 1208. but we usually went to my place. bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed.  she was gone when i got back from my last florida trip. too bad. had a beautiful tan.  must have gone home to mother.
was her name annabelle horsefield?
that's the one.
i'm going to send you to the hospital to have a few x-rays taken. i want to find out exactly what you're hiding in there, ok? give them this. the address is right there under radiology.
gonna cut me open?
well, let's wait for the x-rays.
used to know a doctor who said he got to know his patients better than their wives did.  cutting a man open sure does expose more of him than pulling down his pants, gotta admit that.
hi.
hi. want a drink?
no thanks. just wanted to tell you that dr. st. luc is coming up to see nick at ten or so.
was he nice to you?
c'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. your father'll never miss it.
i can't, dummy. he'll see that the pack's been opened. you're such a dumbhead.
ok, then. i'm gonna go back to the store and buy my own pack and smoke 'em all myself.
buy 'em with what, dumbhead?
with some milk jugs i just happened to pick up on the way home.
jesus!
let's get outta here before somebody hears us!
ok, roger. here's the stuff you wanted. files on horsefield, tudor, swinburne, and velakofsky. papers published by hobbes, linsky, and lefebvre in a couple of issues of the bulletin of the canadian medical association and also the journal of the american medical association. and, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files i helped compile before your time here, doctor. i thought they might interest you.
that's great, forsythe, great. thanks.
do i get a kiss?
kiss, kiss?
uh, ok. sure.
another kiss?
c'mon, forsythe. are there any more on the list?
no. dotty's the last.
yes?
that you, rog?
yes?
it's me, rollo linsky. remember me?
rollo! how'sa boy? i was just thinking about you.
yeah, well, i'm flattered, but you won't find any real meat in them.
no? how come?
listen, rog. i knew hobbes was funny, you know? i told you that. but i didn't really know just how funny he was. see... when he kicked off, they sent all the personal secret stuff they found to his mother -- she's still alive but just barely -- and she sent everything she thought was medical to me here at the lab. i'm hobbes's partner, right?  anyway, i've been going through his papers, and what they add up to is this: hobbes was shafting us all, me, the university, the foundations and the councils, the private labs, everybody. we never really knew what it was we were working on. hobbes gave us each a few crumbs, but he was the only one who knew what the whole loaf would look like.
ok, i bite. what does it look like?
it looks like -- and i quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
i don't get it.
lemme clarify for you.
he didn't make it.
huh?
maybe hobbes didn't know it, but annabelle was a pretty popular girl around starliner towers. i've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody i've tried can identify. you were next on my list.
i'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
i've got a date with one of them at ten. can you make it?
yeah.  ah, i don't want to panic you or anything, but, i mean, the way hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... i dunno. but if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
yeah? what do i do then?
i dunno. try tranquilizers. once you can get at them, there's a lotta stuff you can use. i'll bring a bagful. it's just the standard tropical kit. but the trick is to get at them.
ok. it's apartment 1009, south tower, starliner towers. may as well go there directly.
ok, rog. see you at ten.
roger? if you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
meeting rollo at tudor's. might take a while.
doesn't matter to me how late it is. i can keep it warm.
anything wrong?
no. i don't think so.
well? supper at my place?
ok. but late.
great! go back to your files. bye.
forsythe, forsythe! what's wrong? what's happened?
a man... i think i recognized him... a man who lives here. he just...  ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. i just opened the door... i was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
where is he now? do you know?
i think i... i think i killed him. i stabbed him with something and he fell.
will you be ok now? i've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. i've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
oh, no! you're not leaving me here all alone. i'm going with you.
what happened?
please pardon me. i am niccolo spergazzi. i am a resident here. i don't know... we were walking in the hallway and... cabiria... my wife... she was attacked by this thing... here, on her arm.
where is this thing that attacked your wife?
i hit it. i hit it with my cane. then i carry it on the cane and i throw it down to the incinerator, down to the garbage.
go back to their apartment with them and treat her for second-degree burns. it'll have to do for now.  what's your number? the number of your apartment?
we live in 703.
ok. i'll meet you back there. don't leave until i get there. lock the door and don't open it except for me. ok?
but where are you going?
down to the incinerator.
do you want to make love? you're absolutely beautiful, those eyes, that expression. you're absolutely the most sexy thing alive. do you want to make love?
nick, you're so strange...
you will make love to me, won't you, janine? won't you make love to me? you start it. won't you? i think i've forgotten how to start.
oh, nick, nick... i can't take this.
please, janine. please, pleasepleaseplease, janine janine janinejaninejanine...
make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
i want to be able to see us, nick. i... i'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, ok? is that ok?  i want to be able to see us when we make love, ok?
oh, you feel very good, betts. you have such a cosy body. i'm jealous, i'm so skinny.
make love to me, 'nine? i want you to make love to me. please, please make love to me.
yes? who is there?
it's dr. st. luc, mr spergazzi. let me speak to the nurse, please.
oh, but the nurse, she went away. i think she must go to look for you.
can i call you at the office?
what do you want to call me at the office for?
i don't know. i just thought i might want to call you. i don't know.
i won't be at the office except to sign in.  i've got a lot of claims to check out. all over the place. garages and more garages.  i'll come home right after work.
