i thought you were going to join us. jesus, garland, you left me alone with those people.
don't panic, i'll join you in a minute.  what's you think of richard and poppy?
we have to talk a little business. i've just been on the phone to los angeles.  barton, capitol pictures wants to put you under contract. they've offered you a thousand dollars a week. i think i can get them to go as high as two.
to do what?
what do you do far a living?
i'm not sure anymore. i guess i try to make a difference.
fair enough. no pressure here, barton, because i respect you, but let me point out a couple of things. one, here you make a difference to five hundred fifty people a night – if the show sells out.  eighty five million people go to the pictures every week.
to see pap.
yes, generally, to see pap. however, point number two: a brief tenure in hollywood could support you through the writing of any number of plays.
i don't know, garland; my place is here right now. i feel i'm on the brink of success-
i'd say you're already enjoying some.
...i guess i'm sprouting off again. but i am certain of this, garland: i'm capable of more good work. maybe better work than i did in choirs. it just doesn't seem to me that los angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.
okay barton, you're the artist, i'm just the ten percenter. you decide what you want and i'll make it happen. i'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism – if i can use that word and hollywood in the same breath.
...look, they love you, kid – everybody does. you see caven's review in the herald?
no, what did it say?
take my copy. you're the toast of broadway and you have the opportunity to redeem that for a little cash – strike that, a lot of cash.
welcome to the hotel earle. may i help you, sir?
i'm checking in. barton fink.
f-i-n-k. fink, barton. that must be you, huh?
must be.
okay then, everything seems to be in order. everything seems to be in order.
...are you a tranz or a rez?
excuse me?
transient or resident?
i don't know... i mean, i'll be here, uh, indefinitely.
rez. that'll be twenty-five fifty a week payable in advance. checkout time is twelve sharp, only you can forget that on account you're a rez. if you need anything, anything at all, you dial zero on your personal in-room telephone and talk to me. my name is chet.
well, i'm going to be working here, mostly at night; i'm a writer. do you have room service?
kitchen closes at eight but i'm the night clerk. i can always ring out for sandwiches.
...okay
huh?
okey-dokey, go ahead.
what –
don't you wanna go to your room?!
...those your only bags?
the others are being sent.
how d'ya like your room!
...who is this?
chet!
...who?
chet! from downstairs!
...where did we put him?
i'm at the earle.
never heard of it. let's move him to the grand, or the wilshire, or hell, he can stay at my place.
thanks, but i wanted a place that was less...
less hollywood?  sure, say it, it's not a dirty word. sat whatever the hell you want. the writer is king here at capitol pictures. you don't believe me, take a look at your paycheck at the end of every week – that's what we think of the writer.  ...so what kind of pictures does he like?
mr. fink hasn't given a preference, mr.  lipnik.
how's about it, bart?
to be honest, i don't go to the pictures much, mr. lipnik –
that's okay, that's okay, that's okay – that's just fine. you probably just walked in here thinking that was going to be a handicap, thinking we wanted people who knew something about the medium, maybe even thinking there was all kind of technical mumbo- jumbo to learn. you were dead wrong. we're only interested in one thing: can you tell a story, bart?  can you make us laugh, can you make us cry, can you make us wanna break out in joyous song? is that more than one thing? okay.  the point is, i run this dump and i don't know the technical mumbo-jumbo. why do i run it? i've got horse-sense, goddamnit. showmanship. and also, and i hope lou told you this, i bigger and meaner than any other kike in this town. did you tell him that, lou? and i don't mean my dick's bigger than yours, it's not a sexual thing – although, you're the writer, you would know more about that. coffee?
...yes, thank you.
lou.
...thanks lou. join us. join us. talking about the wallace beery picture.
excellent picture.
we got a treatment on it yet?
no, not yet jack. we just bought the story. saturday evening post.
okay, the hell with the story. wallace beery is a wrestler. i wanna know his hopes, his dreams. naturally, he'll have to get mixed up with a bad element. and a romantic interest. you know the drill.  romantic interest, or else a young kid. an orphan. what do you think, lou? wally a little too old for a romantic interest?  look at me, a writer in the room and i'm askin' lou what the goddamn story should be!
...well bart, which is it? orphan? dame?
...both maybe?
...maybe we should do a treatment.
ah, hell, let bart take a crack at it.  he'll get into the swing of things or i don't know writers. let's make it a dame, bart, keep it simple. we don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. the important thing is we all have that barton fink feeling, but since you're barton fink i'm assuming you have it in spades.  seriously bart, i like you. we're off to a good start. dammit, if all our writers were like you i wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. i'd like to see something by the end of the week.
neighbor, i'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
that's all right, really, thank you.
all right, hell, you trying to work and me carrying on in there. look, the liquor's good, wuddya say?
... you got a glass? it's the least i can do.
okay... a quick one, sure...
yeah, just a nip. i feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
that's okay, i assure you. it's just that i was trying to work –
what kind of work do you do, barton, if you don't mind my asking?
well, i'm a writer, actually.
you don't say. that's a tough racket. my hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. damned interesting work, i'd imagine.
can be. not easy, but –
damned difficult, i'd imagine.
and what's your line, mr. meadows?
hell no! call me charlie. well barton, you might say i sell peace of mind. insurance is my game – door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
...in spite of what you might think from tonight, i'm pretty good at it.
doesn't surprise me at all.
hell yes. because i believe in it. fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what i tell 'em. writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
thanks, i'll keep it in mind.
what kind of scribbler are you – newspaperman did you say?
no, i'm actually writing for the pictures now –
pictures! jesus!
...is the egg showing or what?!
that's okay; actually i am just starting out in the movies – though i was pretty well established in new york, some renown there,
oh, it's an exciting time then. i'm not the best-read mug on the planet, so i guess it's no surprise i didn't recognize your name. jesus, i feel like a heel.
that's okay, charlie. i'm a playwright. my shows've only played new york. last one got a hell of a write-up in the herald. i guess that's why they wanted me here.
hell, why not? everyone wants quality. what kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
what do i write about?
caught me trying to be fancy! yeah, that's it, bart.
well, that's a good question. strange as it may seem, charlie, i guess i write about people like you. the average working stiff. the common man.
well ain't that a kick in the head!
yeah, i guess it is. but in a way, that's exactly the point. there's a few people in new york – hopefully our numbers are growing – who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths – not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...
...i don't guess this means much to you.
hell, i could tell you some stories–
and that's the point, that we all have stories. the hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. it's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? don't call it new theater, charlie; call it real theater. call it our theater.
i can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
well, i don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there?  who cares about the fifth earl of bastrop and lady higginbottom and – and – and who killed nigel grinch-gibbons?
i can feel my butt getting sore already.
exactly, charlie! you understand what i'm saying – a lot more than some of these literary types. because you're a real man!
and i could tell you some stories –
sure you could!  and yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man – from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and – and – and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and – well, i'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.
yeah, i guess that's tragedy right there.
frequently played, seldom remarked.
you're all right, charlie. i'm glad you stopped by. i'm sorry if – well i know i sometimes run on.
hell no! jesus, i'm the kind of guy, i'll let you know if i'm bored. i find it all pretty damned interesting. i'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.
well, we've got something in common then.
sure, sure charlie, you can help by just being yourself.
well, i can tell you some stories –
...and look, i'm sorry as hell about the interruption. too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.
see you, charlie.
i'm a writer, mr. geisler. ted okum said i should drop by morning to see you about the –
ever act?
...huh? no, i'm –
we need indians for a norman steele western.
i'm a writer. ted o –
think about it, fink. writers come and go; we always need indians.
i'm a writer. ted okum said you're producing this wallace beery picture i'm working on.
what!?  ted okum doesn't know shit. they've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. what ted okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the hollywood bowl.
then who should i talk to?
don't worry about it. it's just a b picture. i bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it. life is too short.
but lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
sure he did. and he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.
okay. i'm just having trouble getting started. it's funny, i'm blocked up. i feel like i need some kind of indication of... what's expected –
wallace beery. wrestling picture. what do you need, a road map?
...look, you're confused? you need guidance? talk to another writer.
who?
i beg your pardon?
w.p. mayhew? the writer?
just bill, please.
sir, i'm flattered that you even recognize my name. my god, i had no idea you were in hollywood.
all of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the great salt lick. mebbe that's why i allus have such a powerful thrust.
...a little social lubricant, mistuh fink?
it's still a little early for me.
so be it.
is, uh... is he okay?
he will be... when he can't write, he drinks.
i am sorry, it's so embarassing.
how about you? will you be alright?
i'll be fine... are you a writer, mr fink?
yes i am. i'm working on a wres – please call me barton.
i'll tell bill you dropped by. i'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
perhaps you and i could get together at some point also. –i'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. i just... i don't know anyone here in this town.
perhaps the three of us, mr. fink.
please, barton.
barton. you see, barton, i'm not just bill's secretary – bill and i are... i love. we-
i see.
...i know this must look... funny.
no, no –
howdy, neighbor.
charlie. how are you.
jesus, i hope i'm not interrupting you again. i heard you walking around in here.  figured i'd drop by.
yeah, come in charlie. hadn't really gotten started yet – what happened to your ear?
oh, yeah. an ear infection, chronic thing.  goes away for a while, but it always comes back. gotta put cotton in it to staunch the flow of pus. don't worry, it's not contagious.
seen a doctor?
ah, doctors. what's he gonna tell me?  can't trade my head in for a new one.
no, i guess you're stuck with the one you've got. have a seat.
thanks, i'd invite you over to my place, but it's a goddamn mess. you married, bart?
nope.
i myself have yet to be lassoed.
...got a sweetheart?
no... i guess it's something about my work. i get so worked up over it, i don't know; i don't really have a lot of attention left over, so it would be a little unfair...
yeah, the ladies do ask for attention. in my experience, they pretend to give it, but it's generally a smoke- screen for demanding it back – with interest. how about family, bart? how're you fixed in that department?
my folks live in brooklyn, with my uncle.
mine have passed on. it's just the three of us now...
...what's the expression – me myself and i.
sure, that's tough, but in a sense, we're all alone in this world aren't we charlie?  i'm often surrounded by family and friends, but...
...it was taken by one of my policy holders. they're more than just customers to me, barton.  they really appreciate what i have to offer them. ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time –
you know, in a way, i envy you charlie.  your daily routine – you know what's expected. you know the drill. my job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. there's no road map for that territory...
...this must be boring you.
not at all. it's damned interesting.
yeah...
...probably sounds a little grand coming from someone who's writing a wrestling picture for wallace beery.
beery! you got no beef there! he's good.  hell of an actor – though, for my money, you can't beat jack oakie. a stitch, oakie. funny stuff, funny stuff. but don't get me wrong – beery, a wrestling picture, that could be a pip. wrestled some myself back in school. i guess you know the basic moves.
nope, never watched any. i'm not that interested in the act itself –
okay, but hell, you should know what it is. i can show you in about thirty seconds.
...you're a little out of your weight class, but just for purposes of demonstration –
that's all right, really –
not a bit of it, compadre! easiest thing in the world! you just get down on your knees to my left, slap your right hand here...
...all right now, when i say "ready... wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and i try and pin you. that's the whole game. got it?
...yeah, okay.
ready... wrestle!
it's okay, it's okay.
well, that's all that wrestling is. except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. well, it's your first time. and you're out of your weight class.
if i close m'eyes i can almost smell the live oak.
that's hamburger grease, bill.
well, m'olfactory's turnin' womanish on me – lyin' and deceitful...
...still, i must say. i haven't felt peace like this since the grand productive days. don't you find it so, barton? ain't writin' peace?
well... actually, no bill...
...no, i've always found that writing comes from a great inner pain. maybe it's a pain that comes from a realization that one must do something for one's fellow man – to help somehow to ease his suffering.  maybe it's a personal pain. at any rate, i don't believe good work is possible without it.
mmm. wal, me, i just enjoy maikn' things up. yessir. escape... it's when i can't write, can't escape m'self, that i want to tear m'head off and run screamin' down the street with m'balls in a fruitpickers pail. mm...
...this'll sometimes help.
that doesn't help anything, bill.
so now i'm s'posed to roll over like an ol' bitch dog gettin' ger belly scratched.
bill –
look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent – don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
and what would that be, son?
i don't know exactly. but i do know what you're doing with that drink. you're cutting yourself off from your gift, and from me and audrey, and from your fellow man, and from everything your art is about.
no son, thisahere moonshine's got nothin' to do with shuttin' folks out. no, i'm usin' it to build somethin'.
what's that?
i'm buildin' a levee. gulp by gulp, brick by brick. raisin' up a levee to keep that ragin' river of manure from lappin' at m'door.
m'honey pretends to be impatient with me, barton, but she'll put up with anything.
not anything, bill. don't test me.
am i? maybe to a schoolboy's eye. people who know about the human heart, though, mebbe they'd say, bill over here, he gives his honey love, and she pays him back with pity – the basest coin there is.
stop it, bill!
let him go.
that son of a bitch... don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
i'll jus' walk on down to the pacific, and from there i'll... improvise.
are you all right?
...oh barton, i feel so... sorry for him!
what?! he's a son of a bitch!
no, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about estelle. his wife still lives in fayettesville. she's... disturbed.
really?...
...well that doesn't excuse his behavior.
he'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. he always does.
okay, but that doesn't excuse his –
barton. empathy requires... understanding.
what. what don't i understand?
i hope these are your shoes.
hi, charlie.
because that would mean they gave you mine.
yeah, as a matter of fact they did. come on in.
jesus, what a day i've had. ever had one of those days?
seems like nothing but, lately.
jesus, what a day. felt like i couldn't've sold ice water in the sahara. jesus. okay, so you don't want insurance, so okay, that's your loss. but god, people can be rude. feel like i have to talk to a normal person like just to restore a little of my...
well, my pleasure. i could use a little lift myself.
a little lift, yeah...
...did i say rude? people can be goddamn cruel. especially some of their housewives. okay, so i've got a weight problem. that's my cross to bear. i dunno...
well it's... it's a defense mechanism.
defense against what? insurance? something they need? something they should be thanking me for offering? a little peace of mind?...
...listen to me belly-achin'. as if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. how goes the life of the mind?
well, it's been better. i can't seem to get going on this thing. that one idea, the one that lets you get started – i still haven't gotten it. maybe i only had one idea in me – my play. maybe once that was done, i was done being a writer.  christ, i feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
those two love-birds next door drivin' you nuts?
how did you know about that?
know about it? i can practically see how they're doin' it. brother, i wish i had a piece of that.
yeah, but –
seems like i hear everything that goes on in this dump. pipes or somethin'. i'm just glad i don't have to ply my trade in the wee-wee hours.
...ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. you've got a head on your shoulders. what is it they say? where there's a head, there's a hope?
where there's life there's hope.
and there's hope for you too, charlie. tomorrow i bet you sell a half-dozen policies.
thanks, brother. but the fact is, i gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
you're leaving?
in a few days. out to your stompin' grounds as a matter of fact – new york city. things have gotten all balled up at the head office.
i'm truly sorry to hear that, charlie. i'll miss you.
well hell, buddy, don't pull a long face!  this is still home for me – i keep my room, and i'll be back sooner or later...
...your room does that too?
i guess the heat's sweating off the wallpaper.
what a dump...
...i guess it seems pathetic to a guy like you.
well...
well it's pathetic, isn't it? i mean to a guy from new york.
what do you mean?
this kind of heat. it's pathetic.
well, i guess you pick your poison.
so they say.
don't pick up and leave without saying goodbye.
course not, compadre. you'll see me again.
wuddya got for me – what the hell happened to your face?
nothing. it's just a mosquito bite.
like hell it is; there are no mosquitos in los angeles. mosquitos breed in swamps – this is a desert town. wuddya got for me?
well i...
on the beery picture! where are we? wuddya got?
well, to tell you the truth, i'm having some trouble getting started–
getting started! christ jesus! started?!  you mean you don't have anything?!
well not much.
what do you think this is? hamlet? gone with the wind? ruggles of red gap? it's a goddamn b picture! big men in tights! you know the drill!
i'm afraid i don't really understand that genre. maybe that's the prob-
understand shit! i though you were gonna consult another writer on this!
well, i've talked to bill mayhew-
bill mayhew! some help! the guy's a souse!
he's a great writer –
a souse!
you don't understand. he's in pain, because he can't write-
souse! souse! he manages to write his name on the back of his paycheck every week!
but... i thought no one cared about this picture.
you thought! where'd you get that from?  you thought! i don't know what the hell you said to lipnik, but the sonofabitch likes you! you understand that, fink? he likes you! he's taken an interest. never make lipnik like you. never!
i don't understand-
are you deaf, he likes you! he's taken an interest! what the hell did you say to him?
i didn't say anything-
well he's taken an interest!  that means he'll make your life hell, which i could care less about, but since i drew the short straw to supervise this turkey, he's gonna be all over me too! fat-assed sonofabitch called me yesterday to ask how it's going – don't worry, i covered for you. told him you were making progress and we were all very excited. i told him it was great, so now my ass is on the line.  he wants you to tell him all about it tomorrow.
i can't write anything by tomorrow.
who said write? jesus, jack can't read.  you gotta tell it to him-tell him something for chrissake.
well what do i tell him?
pick it up... pick it up. pick it-
hello.
audrey, listen, i need help. i know it's late and i shouldn't be calling you like this – believe me i wouldn't have if i could see any other alternative, but i – i'm sorry - listen, how are you – i'm sorry. you doing okay?
...who is this?
barton. i'm sorry, it's barton fink.
barton, i'm afraid it's not a good time-
drown all those rascals...
i'm sorry, i just feel like –i know i shouldn't ask, i just need some kind of help, i just, i have a deadline tomorrow-
i said drown 'em all! who is that?
all right barton, i'll see if i can slip away-
who is that?! gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
if you could, i'd –
if i can. he gets jealous; he-
goddamn voices... drown 'em!
i need help, audrey.
i'll try to slip out. if he quiets down, passes out... i'm afraid he thinks – well, he said you were a buffoon, barton. he becomes irrational–
hesh up! be still now! drown 'em! drown 'em! drown –
hello, barton.
audrey, thank you for coming. thank you.  i'm sorry to be such a... such a... thank you.
now that's all right, barton. everything'll be all right.
yes. thank you. how's bill?
oh, he's... he drifted off. he'll sleep for a while now. what is it you have to do, exactly?
well i have to come up with – an outline, i'd guess you call it. the story. the whole goddamn story. soup to nuts. three acts. the whole goddamn-
it's alright, barton. you don't have to write actual scenes?
no, but the whole goddamn – audrey? have you ever had to read any of bill's wrestling scenarios?
yes, i'm afraid i have.
what are they like? what are they about?
well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. there's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end. in between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect.  bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict. and sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild.  the studio always hated that. oh, some of the scripts were so... spirited!
well... this.
you wrote his scripts for him?
well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
you wrote bill's scripts!  jesus christ, you wrote his – what about before that?
before what?
before bill came to hollywood.
well, bill was always the author, so to speak-
what do you mean so to speak?! audrey, how long have you been his... secretary?
barton, i think we should concentrate on our little project-
i want to know how many of bill's books you wrote!
barton!
i want to know!
barton, honestly, only the last couple-
hah!
and my input was mostly... editorial, really, when he'd been drinking-
i'll bet. jesus – "the grand productive days." what a goddamn phony.
...can i come in?
no!... i'm fine. thank you.
are you sure –
no... no...
barton. are you all right?
no... can i come in?
why don't we go to your room-
charlie, i'm in trouble. you've gotta help me.
get a grip on yourself, brother. whatever the problem is, we'll sort it out.
charlie, i'm in trouble – something horrible's happened – i've gotta call the police...
...will you stay with me till they get here?
don't worry about it, barton. we can sort it-
...jesus, barton, what the hell is this?  what're we gonna do?
i've gotta call the police – or you could call for me –
hold on –
you gotta believe me –
hold on –
i didn't do this, i did not do this–
hold on. stop. take a deep breath. tell me what happened.
i don't know! i woke up, she was... god, you gotta believe me!
i believe you, brother, but this don't look good.
we gotta call the police –
hold on. i said hold on, so hold on.
yeah.
what do you think happened?
i don't know!  maybe it was her... boyfriend. i passed out. i don't know.  won't the police be able to –
stop with the police! wake up, friend! this does not look good! they hang people for this!
but i didn't do it – don't you believe me?
i believe you – i know you. but why should the police?
jesus... they can tell that...
they gotta believe me, charlie! they gotta have mercy!
you're in pictures, barton. even if you got cleared eventually, this would ruin you.
...uh-huh... where's audrey?
she's dead, barton! if that was her name.
yeah... rye whiskey?
boy! you writers! work hard, play hard!  that's what i hear, anyway...
...it's a tenement building. on the lower east side...
great! he's poor, this wrestler! he's had to struggle!
and then... well...
...can i be honest, mr. lipnik?
can you?  you damn well better be. jesus, if i hadn't been honest in my business dealings – well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town – but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things – if i'd been totally honest, i wouldn't be within a mile of this pool – unless i was cleaning it. but that's no reason for you not to be. honest, i mean.  not cleaning the pool.
mr. lipnik, i –
this man creates for a living! he puts food on your table and on mine! thank him for it!  thank him, you ungrateful sonofabitch! thank him or you're fired!
get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
mr. lipnik, please –
i – mr. lipnik –
kiss this man's feet!!
mr. lipnik, i –
i apologize, barton.
no no, mr. breeze has actually been a great help –
you don't have to cover for him. it's noble of you, but these things happen in business.
mr. lipnik, i really would feel much better if you could reconsider –
ah, forget it, kid. i want you to pull this out of your head. if that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, i will. i respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
jesus... you're leaving.
have to, old timer. just for a while.
jesus, charlie, i...
everything's okay, believe me. i know it's rough mentally, but everything's taken care of.
charlie! i've got no one else here! you're the only person i know in los angeles...
it's okay... it's okay...
charlie, i feel like i'm going crazy – like i'm losing my mind. i don't know what to do... i didn't do it, believe me. i'm sure of that, charlie. i just...
...i just don't know what... to do–
you gotta get a grip on, brother. you gotta just carry on – just for a few days, till i get back. try and stay here, keep your door locked. don't talk to anyone. we just gotta keep our heads and we'll figure it out.
yeah, but charlie –
dammit, don't argue with me. you asked me to believe you – well i do. now don't argue with me.
sure, charlie.
funny, huh, when everything that's important to a guy, everything he wants to keep from a lifetime – when he can fit it into a little box like that. i guess... i guess it's kind of pathetic.
it's more than i've got.
well, keep it for me. maybe it'll bring you good luck. yeah, it'll help you finish your script. you'll think about me...
you'll be back?
don't worry about that, compadre. i'll be back.
l.a.p.d.
uh-huh.
got a couple questions to ask ya.
what do you do, fink?
i write.
oh yeah? what kind of write?
well as a matter of fact, i write for the pictures.
big fuckin' deal.
you want my partner to kiss your ass?
would that be good enough for ya?
no, i – i didn't mean to sound –
what did you mean?
i – i've got respect for – for working guys, like you –
jesus! ain't that a load off! you live in 605?
yeah.
how long you been up there, fink?
a week, eight, nine days –
is this multiple choice?
nine days – tuesday –
...yeah, he... he lives next door to me.
that's right, fink, he lives next door to you.
ever talk to him?
...once or twice. his name is charlie meadows.
yeah, and i'm buck rogers.
his name is mundt. karl mundt.
also known as madman mundt.
he's a little funny in the head.
what did... what did he –
funny. as in, he likes to ventilate people with a shotgun and then cut their heads off.
yeah, he's funny that way.
i...
started in kansas city. couple of housewives.
couple of days ago we see the same m.o. out in los feliz.
doctor. ear, nose and throat man,.
all of which he's now missin'.
well, some of his throat was there.
physician, heal thyself.
good luck with no fuckin' head.
anyway.
hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. not too far from here. this one's better looking than the doc.
female caucasian, thirty years old. nice tits. no head. you ever see mundt with anyone meets that description?
but, you know, with the head still on.
...no. i never saw him with anyone else.
so. you talked to mundt, what about?
nothing, really. said he was in the insurance business.
yeah, and he's buck rogers.
no reputable company would hire a guy like that.
well that's what he said.
what else?
he... i'm trying to think... nothing, really... he... he said he liked jack oakie pictures.
ya know, fink, ordinarily we say anything you might remember could be helpful. but i'll be frank with you: that is not helpful.
ya see how he's not writing it down?
fink. that's a jewish name, isn't it?
...hello.
garland, it's me.
barton? what time is it? are you all right?
yeah, i'm fine, garland – i have to talk to you. i'm calling long distance.
okay.
...what is it barton? are you okay?
i'm fine, garland, but i have to talk with you.
go ahead, son.
it's about what i'm writing, garland. it's really... i think it's really big.
what do you mean, barton?
not big in the sense of large – although it's that too. i mean important. this may be the most important work i've done.
well, i'm... glad to hear that –
very important, garland. i just thought you should know that. whatever happens.
...that's fine.
have you read the bible, garland?
...barton, is everything okay?
yes... isn't it?
well, i'm just asking. you sound a little –
sound a little what?
well, you just... sound a little–
...i thought you said you were a writer.
i dunno, duke. i kinda liked it.
second one of your friends to end up dead.
you didn't tell us you knew the dame.
sixth floor too high for you, fink?
give you nose bleeds?
charlie... charlie's back...
no kidding, bright boy – we smelt mundt all over this. was he the idea man?
tell us where the heads are, maybe they'll go easy on you.
only fry you once.
could you come back later?  it's just...  too hot... my head is killing me.
all right, forget the heads. where's mundt, fink?
he teach you to do it?
you two have some sick sex thing?
sex?! he's a man! we wrestled!
you're a sick fuck, fink.
why's it so goddamn hot out here?
...fred...
...don't look at me like that, neighbor.  it's just me – charlie.
i hear it's mundt. madman mundt.
but charlie – why me? why –
because you don't listen!
fink.
mr. lipnik.
colonel lipnik, if you don't mind.
...i was commissioned yesterday in the army reserve. henry morgenthau arranged it. he's a dear friend.
congratulations.
actually it hasn't officially gone through yet. had wardrobe whip this up. you gotta pull teeth to get anything done in this town. i can understand a little red tape in peacetime, but now it's all-out warfare against the japs. little yellow bastards.  they'd love to see me sit this one out.
yes sir, they –
anyway, i had lou read your script for me.
...i gotta tell you, fink. it won't wash.
with all due respect, sir, i think it's the best work i've done.
don't gas me, fink. if you're opinion mattered, then i guess i'd resign and let you run the the studio. it doesn't and you won't, and the lunatics are not going to run this particular asylum. so let's put a stop to that rumor right now.
yes sir.
i had to call beery this morning, let him know we were pushing the picture back.  after all i'd told him about quality, about that barton fink feeling. how disappointed we were. wally was heartbroken. the man was devastated. he was – well, i didn't actually call him, lou did. but that's a fair description, isn't it lou?
yes, colonel.
hell, i could take you through it step by step, explain why your story stinks, but i won't insult your intelligence. well all right, first of all: this is a wrestling picture; the audience wants to see action, drama, wrestling, and plenty of it. they don't wanna see a guy wrestling with his soul – well, all right, a little bit, for the critics – but you make it the carrot that wags the dog. too much of it and they head for exits and i don't blame 'em. there's plenty of poetry right inside that ring, fink. look at "hell ten feet square".
"blood, sweat, and canvas".
look at "blood, sweat, and canvas". these are big movies, fink. about big men, in tights – both physically and mentally. but especially physically. we don't put wallace beery in some fruity movie about suffering – i thought we were together on that.
i'm sorry if i let you down.
you didn't let me down. or even lou. we don't live or die by what you scribble, fink. you let ben geisler down. he liked you. trusted you. and that's why he's gone. fired.  that guy had a heart as big as the outdoors, and you fucked him. he tried to convince me to fire you too, but that would be too easy. no, you're under contract and you're gonna stay that way.  anything you write will be the property of capitol pictures. and capitol pictures will not produce anything you write. not until you grow up a little. you ain't no writer, fink – you're a goddamn write-off.
i tried to show you something beautiful.  something about all of us –
