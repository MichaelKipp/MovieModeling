what kind of a crash was it?
you seen my suitcase?
there is nothing on the news about a crash.  did he say what airline?
he did not say much at all.  honey --
in the closet.  i do not understand, norman -- why would they call you?
do not be so supportive, honey.
well, i can not imagine five years of unemployment --
four.  four years --
four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume.
keep watching the news.  are you watching the news?
how are you getting to the airport? you need money for the bus?
there is a u.s.  navy car outside, norman.
what?
was it a military crash?
i do not know.
they never used to send a navy car.
I am in psychology.  was.  still am really, just been a while.  i treat aircrash survivors.
oh, so you are that dr. johnson.
you have heard of me?
well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote.
what report?
huh?
what report?
you mean you do not know?
know what?
must be another johnson then.  been flying so many scientists out here -- can not keep everyone straight.
who is everyone?
physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it.
geologists?  at a plane crash?
strange, is not it?  in the middle of the ocean no less.
what the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash?
any other bags, dr. johnson?
just that.  careful, it is heavy.
no other equipment?  scientific instruments?
no, they did not say --
this way, sir.
captain barnes wants to see you right away, sir.
captain who?
barnes.  he is very eager to meet you. been calling us every half hour to see if you are arrived.
really?
by the way sir, I have read your report.  i think it is brilliant.
what report?
you mean they have not told you yet?
told me what?
thank you, colonel.
captain.
captain.  right, forgive me.
well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.
do not thank me, dr. johnson.  you were not my choice.  the pentagon made me take you.
the pentagon?  i did not know i had friends in washington.
come with me.  the team's already waiting.
what team?
what have you been told so far?
the usual.  plane crash.  survivers unknown.  routine stuff really.
anything else?
nothing else.
you talk to any reporters?  any press?
press?  no, i haven't.
good.  security's been our biggest worry.  now that you are here we can shut this thing down tight.
from what?  what is with all the security?
well, we do not have all the facts yet.
we are moving fast considering the storm.
storm?  what storm?
a cyclone's on it is way in.  i thought they would have told you on the phone.
they did not tell me anything.
how deep is he?
a thousand feet.
a thousand?  an airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- i do not want to sound pessimistic here, but i assume there are no survivors.
survivors?  no, i would not think so.
then why am i here?
what?
what do you need me for?
what is it?  a military spacecraft? like a shuttle or satellite?
something like that.  that does not surprise you?
not really, no.  something of the military crashes in the ocean -- it explains why there was nothing on the news, why you have kept everything a secret...  when did it crash?
as best we can estimate, it crashed four hundred years ago.
see this?  coral.  geologists measured the coral growth on top of the craft to be over five meters thick.
geologists?
coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
-- wait a second --
-- dating the crash at least that old.
hold on --
maybe older --
-- there is got to be some mistake here -- a four hundred year old military spacecraft?  there is no such thing... our space program is not even forty years old.
extraordinary, is not it?
it is impossible.
I am afraid it is dr. johnson... because it is sitting on the bottom of our ocean floor.
off the record, i do not mind telling you, this thing scares the shit out of me.
it does not make any sense.
we think it might.  that is why we brought you here.  we have assembled your team -- they are waiting for us now.
what team?
the one you recommended.  in the ulf report you wrote for the bush administration.
ulf report?  nobody's mentioned that in years.  you mean someone actually read it?
your report's become our bible down here, dr. johnson.  we have been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
but sir, i do not understand.  this report -- these recommendations... they are for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
how big is this spacecraft?
of what we are able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
a half a mile long?
the wing dimension alone is larger that any aircraft we have seen.
how much damage?
to the craft?  none.  not a scratch.
right.  so you are saying it survived a high speed impact with water without a scratch?
I am not saying anything, harry, I am just stating the facts.  the outer metal is made of a titanium alloy, built into an epoxy- resin honeycomb.  the necessary technology to bond this type of metal has never been invented.
in basic english, what does all this mean?
basic english?  there is no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
beth, look, can i trust you with a little secret?
i love secrets.
that ulf report everybody's patting me on the back about?
I have read it twice, norman.  it is brilliant.
it is bullshit.  the report's a joke.
that is quite a secret.
i spent a week reading sagan and watching re-runs of the twilight zone.  seriously.  i was just trying to pay the mortgage on my house -- i had no idea --
do yourself a favor, norman.  are you listening?  do not tell anyone what you just told me.
c'mon, beth -- that report's like the blind leading the blind.
because when we get down there --
wait -- down where?
to the spacecraft.  to investigate.
underwater?
what do you expect?  for them to bring it up here?
we can not go down there.  we are not prepared.  that deep?  that takes years of training, beth.  we are just scientists.  lab scietists.  we wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here.  in the ocean.  70 percent of the earth's surface is water, norman.  that is first grade geography.
it never occurred to me.
well, let's pray that is the only mistake you made.  have you said anything to barnes about this?
the timing has never seemed quite right.
just keep your mouth shut, alright? this could mean everything to our careers, you know that?  do not jeopardize this.
what -- are you threatening me?
captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, captain.  open it, please.
calm down, dr. levine.
let me out, captain.  open the door!
please, dr. levine.
... your civil rights have been overridden!
open it, captain!
dr. levine, please!  return to your seat!
pussy.
what is that -- mistake number two, norman?
he was not feeling well.
he is a pussy.
how are you feeling, norman?
what?
you holding up alright?
fine.  I am fine.
do not be defensive.
I am not being defensive.
you sound defensive.
I am fine.
what did you say to him?
to who?  arthur?  nothing.  nothing that norman does not already know.
what does norman already know?
norman thinks we should not be going down.  thinks it is a mistake.
she told me what you said, norman.
what is it, harry?
just one of norman's many secrets.
they pressurize us with helium.
what is wrong with oxygen?
it is a corrosive gas.  on earth, it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an oldsmobile.  at a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic.  breathe it down here, and it will do to your dick what it does to the oldsmobile.
captain, you know, i really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television.
nobody goes inside, until we know what's inside.
can you open that panel?
working on it now, sir.
I would also like it noted --
duly noted, ted.  edmunds, try using suction.
it is not sucking, sir.
thank you, i can see that.  try something else.
we do not have anything else to try, sir.
well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up --
what about a crowbar?
what if we go out there, you know -- wedge a crowbar in the door and pry the thing open.
pry the thing open?  what are we -- neanderthals?
all that banging and pounding.  i do not know.  we should think about making a good first impression.
for who?  the fish?
for whoever's in that thing.
it is just like swimming, norman... you know how to swim, do not you?
you are not afraid of the water, are you, norman?
is not there a psychological term for that, dr. johnson?
yeah.  drowning.
you are next, norman.
no.  go ahead.  really.  ladies first.
such a gentlemen when you are scared shitless.
go ahead.  ladies first.
no, why do not --
c'mon.
wait a second, i --
c'mon, norman.
look, would you --
easy ted, we are not mining gold.
gimme some room here, will you?  back off.  gimme some space.
alot like.  you know, i noticed it before, but i didn't...
shutup, ted.  you did not notice shit. keep hammering.
you want me to try?
you are a 53 year old shrink, what are you going to do?
what is it, norman?
take a look.
it is chipped.
chipped?  the door?  how can it be chipped?
i do not know how it can be chipped, but it is chipped.
i thought you said there was not any damage done in the crash?
i did.
then how can it be chipped?
there is heat coming the door.
back away then.
wait a minute --
i said back away.
would you wait a minute?
ted, get her away from the door.
what are you going to do -- shoot her?
look at this.
what is it?
some sort of lead or something.
radiation shield, you think?
a foot and a half thick?  that would withstand a helluva lot of radiation.
hold on --
what is it?
any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up?
no.  i do not think so.
well, think.  because there is footprints here that are not mine.
well, they are not mine.
it is empty.  why would someone build a ship like this?
you would have to ask them.
alright, beth, do that thing you did before.
how about i just press the button?
strange, is not it?  you know -- how it would have a button.
earth does not have a patent on buttons, ted.
still, make a note i recognized that.
what is wrong?
what do you make of this?
english?
that is right.
i do not get it.
it does not make any sense.
you do not think it does?  i think it is rather obvious.
is it some sort of joke?  like one of those hoaxes?
a spacecraft half a mile long -- with 500 tonnes of coral on top of it?  someone went to a lot of trouble.  try again.
but it is impossible.
is it?
why would this ship carry instructions in english?
think about it.
unless, this alien spacecraft was -- you know -- somehow presenting itself to americans in a way that would make us feel comfortable.
400 years ago?  I am sure christopher columbus would have loved these accomodations.
good theory, ted.
well, what is your theory?
I am a woman.  i do not theorize.  i only deal with facts.
all the facts you need are right in front of you.
gimme a minute here... i think I have got it.
do you?
if it is an alien spacecraft --
save your breath.  it is not an alien spacecraft.
then what is it?
it is an american spacecraft.
an american spacecraft?  half a mile long?  and buried 400 years?  yeah, good theory, harry.
it is been obvious from the start, has not it, captain?  that is why all the secrecy, why no one was told about it?
we had considered it.
considered what?  that it is american? how would you think it is american?
we take a weeny little wedge, bang on it a couple of times, and bust off a chunk of the metal.  yet any spacecraft -- even at a low velocity, say 200 miles an hour -- crashes into the water -- it is going to be like hitting concrete, it would crumple like paper.  but there is not a dent to be seen anywhere.  not even a scratch.
meaning?
meaning it did not land in the water.
please.  it must have flown here --
it did not fly here.  it arrived here.
arrived?  from where?
not where.  when.  400 years ago.  from our future.
time travel.  i always thought it was one of those myths... like santa's reindeer.
what would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
maybe we did not want to come back.
what are you looking for?
a light switch.  a button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power.
norman!
get this thing off me.
nice work, norman.
whatever i can do to help.
our answer.
to what?
time travel.  a black hole.
ted?  captain?
yes, harry.
we know how this craft got here. where it is been.
so do we.  and it seems to have picked up something on it is travels.
picked up something?  what is it?
i do not know.  but it is something alien.
this answers one of our questions.
which one?  let me get the list out.
this spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  they see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  they come across this.  this... sphere.  find it interesting, curious.  they draw it inside to take back home.
but on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past.
our present.
but what does it do?  this... sphere.
maybe it is a message of some sort, you know?  see this red here.
looks like a design, some writing, maybe.  maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message.
look closely.  that is not writing. those are grooves.
no.  they do not represent a message. they are not decorative at all.  they have another purpose entirely.
what?
to conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere.
a break for what?
so how do we get it open?
ted seems to have some ideas.
maybe we shouldn't.
what?
if it is alien, maybe we should not try to open it at all.
man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  the anthropomorphic problem. good, norman.
the what?
i mentioned it in my report.  did not you read the report?
everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  if it does not look human, it is a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding.
so?  what is the problem?
it is nonsense.  there is enough difference between our own species to prove that.
take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
cannibalism, to be extreme.  and now we are talking about a new life form. their values and ethics may be incomprehensible.
like "thou shall not kill"?
or maybe, it can not be killed.
you mean, what is in that thing is immortal?
i do not know.  that is the point.
everything can be killed.
not everything.  even on earth.  take ... yeasts.
yeasts?  thank you, beth, but i do not think we are going to open it up and find a loaf of bread.
and we are just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  what if it is five or six or seven-dimensional?  so dimensional that we could not even see it to kill it.
good point.  i do not know what you are talking about, but good point.
or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind.
it could.  but the odds of it being any use to us are against it.
you do not know that.
let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval europe.  suppose you went back to medieval europe with a tv set.  there would not be any place to plug it in.
just tell me worst case.  worst case of what we might find?
it could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think.
do not be so optomistic, harry.
I am completely serious.  there is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  you know what that is?
not a clue.
a sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible.
i do not follow you.
on that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "unknown entry event." they did not know what a black hole was.  fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible.
so what?
so, we know.  we know it went through a black hole.  we saw it.  norman -- when we would get to the surface, we would tell someone about the black hole, would not we?  it would go in some report like some big discovery.  so in fifty years when they build that ship, they would make precautions for a black hole.  but they didn't.  the called it an unknown entry event.
meaning we are never going to get the chance to tell anyone.
meaning we are never going to get to the surface alive... to tell anyone.
i can not believe that, harry.
gimme another explanation.
i can't.  if i had a minute to think, maybe, but i know you are wrong.
am i?
look -- we are under a lot of pressure, we are tired, you are not thinking straight.
you mean, you think I am cracking?
no.  i did not say that.
then what, norman?
it is what is in that sphere, is not it, harry?  whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it is going to kill you.
curious, is not it?  what is inside? before i die, I would sure like to open it and see.
what caused it?
nothing.  i do not know.  everything was normal.  no changes at all.
do not get hysterical, norman.
I am telling you, harry's lost it. he is saying there is a deathwish out for each of us.
look, the ships are clearing out. they are taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  someone can check him out there, if it is that imprtant.
all I am saying is, someone should keep an eye on him.
just worry about yourself.
can i stay, sir?  I am willing to risk it.  i am.  after what we just witnessed.
what?  no, i know they are civilians...
did you hear me, sir, because --
ted, shut up.  are you packed?  ready to go?  i want everyone packed.  now!
harry's missing.
what do you mean, he is missing?
he is missing.  he is gone.  he left.
he is here somewhere.  find him.  the sub's on it is way.  go!  c'mon!
how can he be missing?
sir, about leaving --
we are on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can not just walk outside!
gimme a report, i want --
ladies and gentlemen...
who is that?  where is that coming from?
please watch your closest monitor...
get him out of there.  i thought i told you people --
harry?  can you copy?
subs are still at surface, sir.
send them, damn it!  i know, but I am not going to be held responsible --
you can not just leave harry down here, sir.
i told you people, nobody goes anywhere unless i say.
but sir --
no "buts".  if he wants to be left, we will leave him.  hello?  yes, the subs -- i want a report...  hello...  yes, a report. gimme... shit.
I am getting no sub reading, sir.
they are coming.
any sign of harry?
nothing, sir.
fuck him.  what?  hello?
i am not leaving without him.  do you hear me?  we come down as a team, we leave as a team.
what are you -- his mother?  get norman, i want everyone ready to go.  edmunds, the subs?
nothing, sir.
what the hell is going on here?
norman?  where is norman?
by the bunks.
norman!
edmunds, do you have a 20 on norman?
yes, sir.
well, where the fuck is he?
in the ship, sir.
sir, if the subs have not left by now...
they have left, keep watching!
sir!  sir, the door -- it is opening.
norman, get out of there now! norman?
if the subs are not here yet, sir --
they switched us over.
to what?
internal power.
the surface ships will be back. after the storm clears.
how long will that be?
they told me about sixty hours.
two and a half days?
what is that?  that noise?
what noise?
it is like...
harry, can you tell me about the sphere?
what are you still doing here?
you remember opening the door?
you were all supposed to leave.  you were not supposed to stay down here.
tell me about the door.  do you remember how you opened the door to the sphere?... harry?
you do not understand about the sphere.
then explain it to me.
norman?
what is it, harry?
what happens on page 87?  have you ever read page 87?
page 87 of what, harry?
i could never read that far.  i never wanted to.
that far in what, harry?
back at the door -- i asked you to back away.
yeah.  i heard you.
there are procedures, beth, that i want followed.  my procedures.  and considering what is going on, i want you to follow them very closely.
forgive me.  I have never read the navy manual.  i wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
hey, go easy on the salt, will ya? we are not a bunch of icy streets here.
salt's good for you, ted.  helps you from getting impotent.
impotent?  I am not impotent.
these are not half bad, fletcher.  you might have a second career coming.
what are they?
when did it come across?
minutes ago.  harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
where is it coming from?
no idea.  we have no surface support. it transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater.
is it coming from our own computer?
harry thinks it is some sort of discharge from our own system, but I have seen it discharge before -- and it did not look anything like this.
getting anywhere with those?
there is some sort of pattern here. it will take a minute.
have you looked outside?  jellyfish. everywhere.  i hate jellyfish.  harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
do not do this.  do not psychoanalyze me.  i hate squid.  period.  just like you hate jellyfish.
you said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die.
did i?
you do not remember that?
i do not remember much.  it is like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but i can not taste any of it.  funny, my senses are much keener though. purer.  hearing, seeing, smelling. like, i can smell your sheets, norman.  you tried to wash it out earlier, but i can still smell the urine.  do not worry, I am not going to tell the others.  it is normal, really, is not it?  in a crisis.  the stress. the panic.
fletcher?  what are you doing out there?
they are like pink snow, sir.  sticky.
she says jellyfish are a delicacy. you know, i never knew that.
get out of there.  i do not want anyone going anywhere outside, understood?
they are warm.  i can feel the heat on my legs.
fletcher, i want you back here.
fletcher, get away from there...
it is burning...
get out of there!
i can not see...
fletcher!  now!
i can't...
nobody move.
but she is --
nobody move!
where did this come from?
the library.
we have a library?
a bad one.  it was the only book in there.  norman, come here, look at this.
no, thank you.  i hate jellyfish.
... when i was six, my younger brother and i -- we went swimming in the pacific.  at my mother's beach house.  we both felt stinging, and when we came out of the water, he was wearing jellyfish head to toe. killed him.
my gosh, norman.
yeah, it was awful.
what about you?  what happened to you?
me?  well, i was wrapped in seaweed. it itched for a while, but i survived.  beth, do you find it... curious that we are seeing all this life down here.  nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  then jellyfish?
normally, I would say no.  everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  makes sense.  but what is curious is -- these are not normal jellyfish.
what do you mean -- not normal?
they have six tentacles.  a new species.  and the squid too.  they had no stomach.
wait a minute.
what?
you knew about the squid not being normal.  before fletcher went out there?
yeah, why?
and you did not tell anyone?
what?  why...
beth --
i mean, I am not... i was not absolutely sure if... they --
they are or they aren't.  which is it?
what?...  wait.  don't... why are you --
beth.
nobody said... norman...  what?  why are you looking at me like that?
beth --
i did not do anything wrong.  i did not mean...
beth.
I am not paranoid.  i know beth.  she can be drastic.
how drastic?
you do not want to know.
i think i do.
a while back, beth and i -- we worked at the same university.  she was assisting a chemist there -- i forget his name -- doing research, experiments.  she was also living with him.  yeah, i know.  and when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
she should have known better.
she put a razor to her wrists a day later.
when was this?
'81, i think.  she tried again five years ago.  i thought you should know.
so you knew this when you wrote your report?
at the time, i do not know, i thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
you knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
wait a second --
-- and then brought her down here --
-- i did not know it would come to this --
-- without a cautionary word to anyone.  you know, ted said something to me earlier.  i think he is right.  he said, "when you got a guy who -- if he was not here -- he would be standing in the unemployment line, you got to question if you got the right guy."
it is a single sequence repeated over and over.
we are all very proud of you, harry, but what the hell is it?
well, if it is a discharge --
it is not a discharge.  right, edmunds?  you said before, right?  so it is got to be a message.
from the sphere?
what is inside the sphere.
if it is a message, it is probably a substitution code.  I will work on it.
yeah, I will work on it, too.
he is manic, norman.  you know that? this reliance on harry is misplaced. you hear me?  totally misplaced.  he is overlooking things.  obvious things.
like what?
it is not some fucking substitution code, it is a direct visual representation.
you mean a picture?
take a look.  i rearranged the numbers.  put 'em up to the light.  go ahead.  squint at it.
i do not see anything.
squint harder.
please, ted.
try this one.
this is like nursery school.
do not you see it?  it is a picture of the creature.
the creature?
inside the sphere.  look, that is the vertical torso, three legs, two arms.  there is no head, so I am guessing the creature's head is located within the torso itself, you know?
well, how about we wait and see what harry comes up with?
sure, why not.  give him the trophy. that pretentious son of a bitch.  you heard him, norman.  all that "someone went to a lot of trouble, try again" bullshit.  and "impotent".  where does he get off saying I am impotent?  he is a fucking self-righteous, little prick.
... i asked myself, why would the sphere be using a code?  if you are trying to communicate, why use a code?
see?  no code.  what did i say?
codes are for hiding information.  so it is making a mistake.  it is making a code without intending to.  i figured it is probably substituting numbers for letters...  then i began to wonder what an alien intelligence would make of our keyboard.  and since we are getting spirals, i imagined the keyboard as a spiral.  so i translated it...
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "g" is one, "b" is two, "h" is three, and so on... when i got the message.
what is the message?
i have to tell you.  it is strange.
how do you mean, strange?
he translated it wrong.  "my name is jerry"?  it is like "see spot run."
the message does not show a lack of intelligence.  it is smart.  it is approaching us in a simple way.  like you would a dog.  holding out your hand, letting it sniff, get used to you.
what am i -- a dog, now?
edmunds, get in here.  i need you for this.
in a minute, sir.
i want a name.  a real name.  this thing's full name, rank and serial number.
captain, i personally feel we should ask much more substantive questions --
i am not gonna explain in some damn report that one person died in a deepsat expedition so we could meet an alien named jerry.
what did you say?
"we are friends".
it is not talking, it is mimicking.
give him a chance.  he is speaking our language, not the other way around.
good idea, ted.
thank you.
ignorant.  the thing's ignorant.
it is not ignorant.
are you enjoying yourself, harry, because i do not know what the hell you are doing.
he understands me fine.
well, he is polite.
unless it is an act.
he does not wait for an answer.
who says it is a he?
not now, beth.  please.  i want to know who we are talking to before we start talking.  where is edmunds?
she is not going to know, sir.
what?
he is saying, "take me to your leader." he wants to know who is in charge.
I am in charge.
with an "o".  harold with an "o".
what -- you want me to retype it?
great, okay.  ask him about his weapons.
that is smart.  let's talk about guns and violence.
you do not think weapons are important?
i think we should be careful. consider his emotional response.
you want to put him on your couch, norman.  grill him about his childhood?
when he uses a phrase like "i am happy", i think we should think twice about what we ask him.
edmunds?  get in here.  i want to know exactly how this is being transmitted.
she is not going to know.
she wired this system.
if the technology of that sphere is advanced enough -- the way it functions is gonna appear to us like magic.
do not gimme that psychology bullshit, norman.  psychology is not a science, it is superstition.  it is a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. with an intellect like this, emotions do not mean shit.
it is like showing leonardo da vinci a laptop computer.  he would run screaming "witchcraft".  and you could not explain it to him, either. modems, microchips, particle physics.
edmunds?
do not make stuff up, these emotional theories, just so you can feel important here.
frankly, ted, I would be much happier if jerry was just a cold, emotionless intellect.
why is that?
edmunds?
because if jerry is powerful and also emotional...
damn it, edmunds?
... it raises a very serious question: what happens if jerry gets mad?
edmunds?  can you copy?
i can not feel her bones.  she is like a sponge.
she was crushed.  feel her skin -- it is like sandpaper.
what could have done this?
what is that?
the sensors are picking up something outside.
what?
it will not register.  it is too big to image.
too big?
norman.
what are they?
eggs.
what was it?
barnes did not know.  could not get a reading.
has harry spoken with jerry?
not that i know of.  why?
you think jerry has something to do with what killed edmunds?  with what is out there?
I am not sure.
well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
what was edmunds doing outside?
resetting the sub.
what sub?
in the dome hanger.  all our tapes are transferred to the sub.  it is on a 12 hour timer.  if someone does not reset the "delay" button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes.
what for?
if something should happen to us, the navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
at least our obituaries will be accurate.  that is reassuring.
I am not sure.  I have never seen anything like it.
you are a fucking biochemist, are not you?  can not you tell us something.
... he lied to us.  he left us down here.
c'mon, beth.  do not make this personal.  he told me himself they were taking us back.
yeah, he told you.  think.  what was barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  he was on the phone. except that cable is a thousand feet long, norman.  they would have broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
so what?
so who was barnes talking to at the last minute?  nobody.
you are jumping to conclusions, beth. do not get worked up --
fuck you, norman!  it is right here...
"although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  signed, barnes, usn."
where did you get this?
in edmunds' things.
you went through edmunds' things?
he is not just a navy captain -- he works for the fucking pentagon.
calm down, beth.  alright?
do not tell me to calm down!
it is done, alright?  it is over!  and there is not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay?
you said something to him, did not you?
what?
you told him about me?
beth --
you did, did not you?
do not do this.
you bastard.
beth, i didn't.  hold it together. alright?
yeah, okay.  sure, norman.
beth --
no, i should stay calm.  like you say.  right, norman?  stay calm.
i do not want you talking to jerry.
but sir, i think it is imperative.  i think the messages, the animals we have seen, what killed edmunds, the reading you got earlier -- i think they are all related.
jerry is not hostile, norman.  he said earlier -- we were his friends --
of course he did.  he is been isloated for 400 years.  he wants someone to talk to.  look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  we are talking about 400 years here.  an alien that shows emotional responses.  i think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
you think he killed edmunds?
yes, i do.  whatever's out there, i think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
bullshit.  what is out there is not alien.  it is an animal.
maybe so.  but i think we need to ask jerry about it.
no.  i think we should shut down the communication lines inside the habitat.  he might be listening now.
nice work, captain sir.
shut up, beth.  i do not want to hear it.
direction's east coming!
what was that?
going active.
jerry?
a squid?  the size of a whale?  i do not think so.  target acquired.  sixty yards.
what if it attacks?
fifty yards and closing.
what do we use for defense?
we are a habitat.  not a castle.  the only defense we have is high voltage.
high voltage?
it sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  but we have never used it underwater before.
forty yards.
but you have tested it?
sure.  each time it started fires inside the habitat.
thirty yards.
what are you saying -- we can not stop what is out there?
what the hell?  it shut us down.
jerry?  please.  stop this.
ted, go into the control room. listen for my instructions.
where is it?
why can not i -- ?  what the hell is going on here?
what was that?
he is right beneath us.
increase positive pressure!
that is our reserve air.
it is either that or we grow gills.
yes, sir.  I am here.
you see the lever on the green box? upper right hand corner?
do not do it, norman!
do you see it?
i see it.
pull it.
do not pull it, norman.  it will start a fire we can not stop.  norman?
do it, norman, it is the only choice we have.  this thing is going to crush us.
norman, do not do it!
do not do it!
now!
norman, please!  don't!
pull it, damn it!
norman johnson.
does this mean what i think it means?
it is over, sir, the storm has cleared.
the ships?
they are topside.  we are ready to take you home, sir.
how are the others?
the others, sir?
beth and harry?
they are in the sub, sir.  waiting.
that whole time -- i could not stop thinking of what harry was saying earlier...
what was that, sir?
about the time paradox.  how we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive --
where are you going in such a hurry?
i have to reset the sub.
forget the sub.
do not bother me, norman.
it is not worth the risk.
it is also our only way out of here! it holds three people.  and there is only three of us left now.
you, me and harry?
you, me and harry.  he is asleep.
wake him, then.  let's go.  get outta --
we can't.  the storm.  the waves would toss us around worse than we got down here.  and we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
four days?
get the helium out of our bloodstream.  we go to the surface now, we would pop like a soda bottle.
maybe you should go.  to the sub.
why should i go?
you should know how it works.  just in case.
in case you die, too?
i do not trust harry to do it.
i would.  but my suit --
i fixed your suit.
you fixed my suit?
you do not trust me?
but i do not know how --
you press a button, norman.  it is not brain surgery.  here, go ahead.  you only have 15 minutes to reset it.  go on, norman...
the sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  you see it?
i can not see anything.  how does it look?  still clear?
still clear.
what is the matter?
you fixed this suit?  beth?
yes, norman.  i did.  you are just nervous.
my air isn't... I am coming back.
you can't.  counter's at 10 minutes. you do not have time.
still clear?
still clear.
... you there?  norman?
harry?
norman, where are you?
i can not breathe...  am i... clear?
you are clear.  you see the airlock?
thank you.  my suit -- beth said she fixed it --
what happened to her?
what do you mean?  she is not here?
when i woke up, nobody was here.
she was supposed to be watching the sensor for me.
her suit's gone.
beth left?
i thought she was with you.
... what do you mean?  I am in the ship.
what are you doing in the ship?  beth?
getting food.  we were out of food. what is wrong?  you sound mad.
yeah, well, i get that way when I am facing death and someone deserts me.
deserts you?  harry said he would take over for me.
he what?
when he woke up, he said we were out of food.  he told me to get some from the ship.
i never said that.
yes you did.  norman, i would not leave you out there.  you know that.
we never even had a conversation, norman.
harry?  that is bullshit.  we stood right there --
she is cracking, norman.
you did not say that about the food?
i was just in the cafeteria, there is plenty of food in there.  take a look for yourself.
but why would she -- ?
she is lying, norman.  just like she lied about fixing your suit.
you get it straightened out?
i think so, beth.  yes.
what is harry doing with your suit in there?
fixing it.
fixing it?  but i fixed --  where did you get all that?
the refridgerator.
the refridgerator.
it is a pretty common place to look for food when you do not think you have any.
that was not in there before.
we must have had it delivered then.
wait a second --
1-800-deepsea delivery.  i hear they are good.
none of this was here before.
did you look?  it was on the top shelf.
no, it wasn't.  i swear none of this was here.  none of it.  you think he hid it?  earlier.  he must have hid it.
you think?
you do not believe me.
all i know is i opened that refridgerator --
damn it, norman.  i swear.  i had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
this being after you so carefully fixed my suit.
you think it is me?  you think I am saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
i do not know, beth.  i was not there.
damn it, norman!  he is lying.  do not you get it?  there is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he is causing it.  why can not you believe me?
page 87.
what?
page 87.  "i could never read that far."
"our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. some skeletons of squids...
squids?
"... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.  that would make a formidable monster."
after the attack, a navy guy woke me up -- i do not know -- i thought he was an illusion.  but i checked the tape, and jerry said he manifested him.
manifested?
created.  brought to life.  i do not know.  but at the end, jerry said, "stop calling me jerry".  and --
he translated it wrong.
what?
remember when we first spoke to jerry, barnes kept asking for jerry's real name?  but harry never would?  he did not because he was afraid the screen would say "harry", instead of jerry.  we were not talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to jerry, we were talking to harry... or a part of harry.
what do you mean, a part of harry?
when did the messages start?  the animals outside start showing up? after harry came out of the sphere.
you think, in the sphere --
he acquired some sort of power.  a power to manifest things.
but how?
i do not know.
how can the sphere do that?
i do not know, beth.  I am not the fucking alien that built the thing. but it can.  when harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  how he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  then you found the book, remember in your lab.  then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid...
which i told barnes was attacking --
it is his fear.  the squid.  he is manifesting his fears.  making them real.
but why is he doing it?
he must not realize he is.  like the navy crewman -- harry was sleeping then.  he must have manifested his dream.
his dream?  you can not control your dreams.  and you can not control your fears, can you?
no.  i mean, we have always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  you ever read the bible?  it talks about our sinful nature, you know?  i mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there is a part of us -- a shadow side, as jung called it -- that can not be controlled.  it is evil. it is inside us.  it is what we are.
and that is the part of harry that is being manifested.
must be.  and if it is -- it is a part of him not even he can control.
looks like some sort of code.
why would harry go back to using a code?
jerry.  right.  i said jerry, did not i?
that is a hell of a mistake to make, beth.
I am sorry.  slip of the tongue.
yeah, i do not know how you could make that confusion.
wisconsin's your answer.
wisconsin?
navy transmission.  they are sent from wisconsin.
how do we decode it?
do not have to.  watch.  it will do it for you.
just in time, too.
in time for what?
what?
just in time for what?
our habitat, i mean.  this place can not handle another attack.
another attack?
why are you looking at me like that?
like what?  I am not --
you are staring at me.
no I am not.  I am not star--
yes you are...
we just figured, you know, the three of us -- we need to... work together through this.
the three of us.
that is right.
is that why the two of you went through my dufflebag?
diphenyl parlene.
something for burns.
ephedrine hydrochloride.
it is for motion sickness.
valdomet.
ulcers.
sintag.
a synthetic opium analogue.
does it cause drowsiness?  that is all we need.  to get him unconscious -- put him under.
nothing about drowsiness.
tarazine?
tranquilizer.  causes drowsiness.
bingo.
"... and may also cause bizarre halucinations".
riordan?
antihistamine.  for bites.
damn it!  chloramphenicol?
antibiotic.
parasolutrine?
how do you spell it?
p-a-r-a-s-o...
it is a soporific.
what is that?
causes sleep.
it is like a sleeping pill?
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
"20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given iv produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... rem activity is surpressed... "
how long does it last?
three to six hours.
I will just boost the doses.
what?  wait -- is not that dangerous?
how fast does it take effect?
does not say.
what if it takes 20 minutes, norman? what if it takes an hour?  and he can fight it off?  we can not afford that.
it is an idea.
beth --
to be on the safe side.  i mean --
you want to kill him?
look, it is either him or us, norman. another attack, and we go down with this place.
you ever given an injection before.
thirty years ago.  in residency.  i passed out.  you?
only lab rats.  here.
what is it?
you know what it is, harry.
it is the squid!  stop it!
stop what?  what are you -- ?
I am sorry.
for what?
not believing you.
you are not sorry.  you are scared.  you are a psychologist, norman.  you pride yourself on knowing when someone is lying to you, not telling you the truth.  and now you are scared ... because you are not sure you can tell anymore.
what is it, norman?
where are you?
in the sub.  resetting the timer. why?
the sphere looks different.
what do you mean, different?
the grooves around the door -- they have shifted.  and the pattern -- the fluids -- they look darker now.
how is harry?
what was that?  i could not hear you.
your watch.
oh yes, my watch.  i almost forgot.
what is wrong, norman?
I am feeling better.
are you?
it is getting cold.
you think I would really drink that?
you do not think i put something in it, do you?
you put explosives around the habitat, i can not imagine what you would put in a drink.
i did do that, did not i?
how do you feel about snakes?
snakes?  what do you mean, exactly?
you know what i mean.
am i afraid of them?  not during the day.  sea snakes are diurnal.  when the sun's out, they do not bite. fortunately for you, i had on my watch.  this is quite good.
what are they doing down here?  in the bathroom?  suddenly appearing.
you tell me.
do you fear them?
do not you?
are you manifesting them?
if i was, then i would have had to have gone in the sphere, would not i?
did you?
what is the phrase -- "keeping up with the joneses"?
why did you go in the sphere, beth?
same reason i put explosives around the habitat.  for defense.  for the power.  to protect myself.
against what?  harry's unconscious. he is not a threat.
no, he isn't.
he can not manifest.
no, he can't.
then why, beth?  why go in?  why put out explosives?  why manifest the snakes?
you think i manifested the snakes?
someone did.
yes, someone did.  but it was not me, norman.  it was you.  you manifested the snakes.
beth you are losing it.  c'mon.
c'mon -- what?
you are lying --
am i lying?  are you sure?  are you absolutely sure I am lying?  then explain to me about the jellyfish.  earlier.  why did we see jellyfish?  harry does not fear jellyfish.  you do.  they are your fear, are not they?
but --
and the snakes?  you want to know about the snakes?  you saw one outside earlier, did not you?  when you thought i had deserted you -- you were terrified.
that is when you went in the sphere.
one lonely, terrifying sea snake.
you manifested that, beth.
did i?  or was that you?  when you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, did not you?  terrified.  like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  you did that, norman.
you are insane.
am i?  or am i making so much sense that you are going insane?
i never went in that sphere.
you do not remember you did.  but I am sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get harry, do not you?  you remember that.
yes.
you remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened?  that is right.  but you can not remember going inside, can you?  no, of course not.  harry could not either, could he?  "like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
that is bullshit.
is it?
beth, the message said harry.  "my name is harry".  my name is not harry.
no, it isn't.  your name is norman. but your younger brother -- what was his name?  the one who was stung when you were younger.  the one that died. the one you could not save.  what was his name?  "mommy, we are going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "but i do not want to go swimming, norman.  I am scared." "c'mon, harry, it will be fine, it will be fun."  you heartless fuck.  that is why you are so scared of the water, is not it?
shut up, beth --
when you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  do you know?  "i can not get beth on the radio.  I am in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  all alone.  surrounded by all this water." was it really the squid that was attacking you, norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  you never really saw what it was, did you?
I am not scaring you, am i norman?  i hope I am not frightening you.  the last thing i want to do is frighten you.  you feel okay, do not you?
it is not me, beth.  i swear.  it can not be.
"it's not me, beth.  it is not me.  it can not be.  I am not doing anything." just like harry said before i stabbed him with the needle.
don't, beth.
but i have to, norman.
i promise --
promise what, norman?  tell me!
beth --
you think I would belive you?  believe anything you might say now?  after you lied to me about telling barnes about my past.  about my problems.  my problems.  not yours.  not his.  mine.
don't, beth.  please.
it is either this... or i kill you.
it is your choice.  because it is not safe for you to be awake.  to be walking around.  to be thinking about things.
it is not safe for you to be either.
you think i care?  you think i care if i die?  would i put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically, if i cared about myself?  would i? I have tried twice before, norman, why would not i try a third time?  I am not thinking about myself -- no, norman, I am thinking about you.  your safety. protecting you from your own self.
this is what I am talking about, norman.  do not you see?  it is in you. this vindictiveness.  this rage.
get away from the door, beth.
of course you are going to deny it. you want to blame someone else.  you want to blame beth.  because you hate beth.
do not fuck with me, beth.
I am not fucking with you, norman. you have fucked yourself.
beth!
you are frightened, are not you, norman?
where is it coming from, beth?
do not you know?
beth, stop it!
stop what?  do not blame me.  it is not me.
then where is it coming from?
from you, norman.  from your mind. you are doing it.
stop it!
it is you, norman.  your fear of drowning.  you have to face it.
beth?
leave me alone, norman.
you can not stop it, norman.  you can not fight me.
i know.  you are too strong, beth.
oh please, do not shrink me, norman. not now.
i --
do not tell me about me.  i already know too much.
beth -- gimme the gun.
oh, sure.  here.  anything else, beth can get you?  some more chicken, perhaps.  let beth check the fridge.
c'mon --
top shelf, is it?
let's get out of here, beth.  let's go home.
what is that?  what are you doing?
what?
you hear that?
hear what?
get away from me!
beth --
get away --
did i kill her?
i do not think so.
i could hit her a little harder. more toward the cranium.
fine.
help me lift her.
we are never going to make it.
shut up and open the door.
how much time you figure to get to the surface?
two and a half minutes.  once we are in the sub.
how far away's the sub?
i can not reach her.
hold on.
push her, c'mon.
I am trying.  shit.  here -- catch her.
missed.
are you trying, damn it?  just --
hold on.
hurry, norman.  four minutes.
i heard!  i heard!
three fifty-six, three fifty-five, three --
shut up and catch.
c'mon, norman!
I am trying to keep balance with --
gimme a second --
just pull her -- down like inside -- harry, work with me here!
her legs are in the way.
you got her?
get her out of the seat, i need room to sit.  harry?
I am trying.  there.
you know how to work this thing?
no idea.
well, press something!
wait!
less than a minute, we are never going to make it.
nine hundred feet to surface.
it is not fast enough, norman. there is a helluva lot of explosive down there.
how is that working out, by the way?
good.  thank you.  now that i have it on.  why are you laughing?  you do not even know what that means.
no.  i don't.  but i always said to myself, when i die, i want to die laughing.
they are going to want answers and they are going to keep asking until they get them.
we can refuse to talk.
will not make any difference.  the tapes document everything.
there is one possibility.
we all kill ourselves?  bad joke.  sorry, beth.
the power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  what if we feared the power to go away?
you mean forget?
it would erase all our knowledge of it.  all of our power.
would it work?
yes.  and i think we already know it will.
how is that?
down below, harry said we would all have to die.  since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. death was the only logical explanation.  but sitting here, we still know.  so how is that possible?  unless we make ourselves forget.
