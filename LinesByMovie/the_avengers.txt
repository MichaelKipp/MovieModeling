good luck ... peter ... emma.
thanks, valentine ...
mother. i thought you were burglars.
brenda and i thought we would drop in.
weather's turning nasty.
you did not come to talk about the weather, surely.
oh yes i did. i want you to meet somebody.  i expect you will like her.
may i help you, madam ...
mr. john steed, please.
I am afraid that is impossible.
impossible?
you are female?
as you see.
then you can not come in.
i have an appointment.
no women. not in boodles. not since 1922.
really -- what happened in 1922?
doctor peel, i presume?
and you must be steed. please do not get up.
i was about to throw in the towel.
i had a spot of bother at the door.
i should not wonder. not a woman inside boodles since --
1922. why the kippers?
red herring would have been too obvious, do not you think?
so what was all this -- some sort of test?
congratulations, you have penetrated a bastion of male privilege. i guessed you were not a stickler for tradition, doctor.
whereas you are.
dyed in the wool. but i can admire someone who does not play by the rules.
rules are made to be broken.
not by me. play by the rules, doctor, or the game is nothing.
and just what is the game?
i say, this is all terribly formal. must i go an calling you dr. peel?
under the circumstances, you may call me mrs. peel.
much better.
and now that we have settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
i didn't. mother did.
mother?
close. we are so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  now let's see, there is coconut cake, date and walnut; i recommend the rum baba ...
hmmm ...
looks like rain, steed...
... showers followed by sunny periods.
we are not here to talk about the weather, surely.
my number two. special assignments. she is --
let me guess -- 'father'?
ah ... from trubshaw's.  my shoemaker.
a kipper. or a red herring? what were they investigating?
a series of bizarre shifts in local weather patterns ...
global warming?
jungle plants in the arctic? a lush english village transformed overnight into african scrubland? blizzards in summer?
how curious ...
something strange is happening. and whoever knows about it does not want us to find out.
your mission is simple. find out how and why these agents died.
I am no spy -- where do i fit in?
your research into climate engineering was state-of-the-art. your experiments could have revolutionized our knowledge of global warming -- had they succeeded. we need your expertise.
perhaps I would better start calling you doctor again, mrs. peel --
think of it as special assignment, mrs. peel. with a twist. you are our chief suspect.
you are saying i have no choice.
father will be your controller. steed here will show you the ropes.
ropes?
think she really killed those agents?
she may not know. theory goes she may be very ill.
amnesia?
possibly. split personality ...
insane ... ?
who knows? if dr. darling is right, you should watch out.
why?
she may try to kill you.
something went wrong. system malfunction. explosion. mrs. peel had a narrow escape. suspected sabotage. nothing proven. file still open.
how come you took so much interest in her, dr. darling?
still doesn't. better safe than sorry.  she was in a dangerous game, steed. high stakes. she may prove to be a risk.  if she is, there is only one solution.  termination.
anyone particular in mind?
you.
my father always wanted a boy.
really?  i fail to see the connection.
i had a feeling you would. touche!
do you?
yes indeed. i need protection.
i thought we were on our way.
oh, absolutely, but trubshaw's a man worth meeting. no point setting out half shod.
or half cocked.
steed, we really must be --
ahh. perfect fit. the luxury of a hand-made shoe. as unique as a face or a fingerprint. or should i say dna?
you can but i wish you would not ...
thank you, trubshaw ...
that place is so absurd, so out of date ...
do you really think so?
you know what i mean. this car -- and you. nobody walks around like that. milk?
not all tradition is bad, mrs. peel. no thank you.
but why? what is the point?
a gentleman has to have a code. this is part of mine. a uniform. think of it as my suit of shining armor.
and i suppose you are the knight.
the most unpredictable piece on the board. and always ready to protect his queen.
that is predictable. when i find a queen in need of protection I will let you know.
sir august merryweather ... why are we seeing him first?
as per mother's instructions.
do we always follow mother's instructions?
for a man in my position --
just what is your position, if you do not mind my asking.  how did a stuffed shirt like you get into this line of work?
they call me in when they have reached a dead end. freelance. like yourself.
i have no choice. why should you risk your life?
after our fencing match, i was rather hoping you would do the risking. more tea?
no thanks.
i meant me.
according to mother, sir august owns half of the highlands. a millionaire. former head of special projects at the ministry. now ...
an eccentric recluse?
not so much eccentric. more barking mad. he has a wife called june. and a daughter somewhere -- julie.
june, july ... august?
the family does seem to be somewhat meteorologically inclined.
any other vices?
all of a piece, really. a fanatical weatherman. chairman of brolly.  british royal organisation for lasting liquid years. thinks british weather has been tampered with by ... aliens.
so ... i distract him while you snoop around? how?
small talk.  try the weather.
sir august ... ? sir august ... ?
eh? in here!
I have come to apply for membership in brolly --
you do not get rain like you used to in england. a good shower that is the ticket. stiffens resolve, puckers the spirit, quells the namby-pamby in a man.
i so agree. how did you acquire a taste for it?
out in india. so character-forming for the british. not the heat. good lord, no. the rain, dash it. a good monsoon. fifteen inches overnight. a whole week of lovely rain. i remember one summer in jaipur ...
you
have we met?
you mean you do not recall??
ah, beautiful. just as he promised.
promised? who promised?
there, look!
ah, brenda ...  mrs. peel?
you should be dead.  how do you feel?
strange.
you were very lucky.  four shots to the heart. i found you after i slipped away from sir august. mother brought you here. not me you should thank.
i was not about to.
i mean your man trubshaw.  your bullet-proof waistcoat.  i thought you were just overdressed.
i might say the same.
mother and dr. darling have me under observation. they think i tried to kill you.
why should they think that?
you told them. you said i arrived on a camel, shot you four times. left you for dead.
frankly that is how i remember it.
but that is absurd. i may not be over-fond of you, steed, but it is not my style.
perhaps your memory plays tricks, mrs. peel.
that is possible. sir august was convinced he would met me before. but I would never met him. another odd thing. when it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
did he say who?
no. but he must know. incidentally, my double left you with this.
an invitation. to a 'formal picnic'...?
did you say formal? i must dress.
i must say, you look more your old self --
you mean my other self ...
either way ... may i ask: why you dress in that fashion?
i should have thought that was obvious ...  I am in mourning.
colonel crabtree. international satellite systems. formerly of the ministry.
how on earth can you tell?
elementary, mrs. peel. trubshaw is not the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
very good, steed ...
what on earth?
any ideas?
well, he was a fellow of the royal zoological society ...
is that written in his shoe?
common knowledge, mrs. peel ...
she had this in her mouth. there, there...
for you, mrs. peel.
thanks ...  i see what you mean about letting me do the risking ... hello?
mrs. peel ... come quickly. brolly's been betrayed! I will tell you everything ... the weather's getting worse and worse ... they are after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
sir august...?  what now?
mrs. peel -- ?
ask not for whom the telephone rings ...
no, please! i beg you ...
walk over to the window ...
let it be rain, please let it be --
stay by the window. by the window.
where is mother?
mobile hq. in a blue funk.  can not take chances. I am looking after things while he is hiding out ...
we know one thing. that suspect was not mrs. peel.
so you say ...
you do not believe him?
it is mother you have to convince. he is very agitated.  wait here.
but
do not bother.  here's a bus ...
welcome to mobile h.q. weather's turning quite nasty. sir august was blown to smithereens. along with half of banffshire.  the ministry's worried.
he tried to warn us ...
we had a lead to wonderland weather but we got there too late. someone tipped them off ...
too late anyway. today's escapade was only for starters. this is no ordinary weather. it is manmade. a kind of weather bomb.
impossible.
not quite. this is my field.
is there anything that isn't?
the prospero project was started by my husband. it was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. in theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. we thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. a 'quick fix'...
filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
exactly. there would been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. propane gas mostly. in small quantities it captures chlorine. protects the ozone layer. but it proved impractical. too bulky ...
but if someone miniaturized the process...
that is what we were working on.
sounds as if someone is hijacked your research.
would it be possible to use it for military purposes?
directed by laser. bounced by satellite. quite possible.
london. the world council of ministers meets soon on global defence. if you can control the weather, you control the world.
after the cold war ...
we are not yet open for business, I am afraid.
shame. i was recommended. by a friend.
really?
sir august merryweather? i was looking for something relaxing. say, a tuscan hillside in june?
normally, we would be eager to oblige --
seriously?
of course. natural weather delivered to your door on demand. down your phoneline. for limited periods.
you do not say. how real does it feel?
as real as you wish. hot or cold. humid or dry. anything you like. within reason.
there are limits?
the technology is brand new. soon it will be more powerful. we anticipate a huge demand. leave us your number. we will be in touch.
no need. I will call again.
three agents killed by bad weather...
... and by you, mrs. peel ...
then a mad millionaire. head of a secret defense establishment. a group of eccentrics obsessed by weather ...
... and by you, mrs. peel. everything points to you.  no sisters?  no undiscovered twin?
not that i know of.  explanation?
according to dr. darling, you are a psychopathic personality with schizophrenic delusions, suffering from recurring amnesia based on traumatic repression, leading to outbursts of anti-social and violent behavior.  q.e.d.
is that what you think?
oh, well ...  just my type, mrs. peel.
do you always drive this fast?
have i trespassed on a male prerogative?  we are being followed. i saw him at trubshaw's ...
are you alright, young man?
i think so, thank you so much ...
cocky little bastard. i hope he was a baddy.
i feel sure of it.
I am alice. mother said you would be on your way. mrs. peel with you?
she was ...
you with mother or father?
both, actually.
good. glad to see they are together at last. they do not get along. promotion. top job. most unfair. quite a fuss at the ministry.
you do not say.  like looking for a needle in a ...
what, lady disdain? are you yet breathing?
barely.
you will let me know if you find that queen who is in need of protection, will not you?
this must be the last straw.
here's the one that broke the camel's back.
someone did not want us to get to the party.
i expect we will have to gatecrash.
wonderland weather ltd.
this way ...
steed ... !
mrs. peel ... ?
quite a collection.
if nature gives a man a collector's mind, it does not matter what he collects. butterflies. old china. penny farthings. a true collector grows more obsessive as the years pass.
your voice -- it is so familiar ...
we have met ...
where am i?
the winslow home for retired lepidoptorists. I am so sorry i struck you, mrs. peel. please forgive me. i thought you were someone else ...
was i?
i expect that is for you to know and me to find out ...
it was peter -- i saw him ...
this man -- did you see him?
no. her husband, she says. alice tried to warn us. a trap. tell mother beware. tell father that is all.
i want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when i say these words. do you understand ... ?  blue ...
... bottle ...
red ...
... head ...
knight ...
black...
... death ...
love...
... death ...
flower ...
... power ...
nature ...
... preserve...
secret ...
... love...
hope...
... love ...
fear ...
... love ...
peter ...
how long have i been here?
three days.
i resign.
you need treatment, mrs. peel.  you can not resign.
watch me.
what are you trying to do to me?
we want to help...!
i thought i was a widow. my husband ... the only man i ever loved ... is dead. for the rest of my life i have to live with that.
the death of peter peel was a great loss. to us all ...
to you ... ?
peter peel was a first class agent. a senior operative. 'x' department special operations. he was engaged in top secret research. top priority.  government approved.
the institute ... the funding ...
a cover ... for us.  I am sorry...
who?
quite frankly ... it could have been you.
you are accusing mrs. peel of killing her own husband?
her husband suspected someone very close to the operation. on the day he died, he was setting a test. to prove to himself -- to us that his wife was beyond suspicion. he had to be certain. he said he was going to give mrs. peel something ...
he said if it vanished, he would know it was ... you who betrayed him. he took a huge risk. the ultimate test.
so I am still ...
this is an official matter, mrs. peel. no need to take it personally. where are you going?
to find out who killed my husband.
the doors and walls are monitored, mrs. peel. this is a very secure establishment.
so am i.
pity. i was growing fond of mrs. peel. unfortunately --
guilty until proven innocent?
mother and father know best.
you followed me.
orders.
to kill me?
nothing personal.
i could save you the trouble.
no trouble.
because you always obey orders ...
always.  except ...
yes ... ?
... when i don't. it comes down to one thing, mrs. peel. trust.
and do you trust me?
i could be convinced, if ... i knew who poisoned me in the maze. that kiss ...
it was not me; you have my word.
mmm ... what are you doing?
keeping a stiff upper lip?
is that all?
but you did suspect me.
not for a moment.
you are playing games.
are not we all, mrs. peel?
i thought you played by the rules.
i thought you didn't.
I am playing to win.
winning is not everything.
please do not tell me it is how you play the game.
after you -- mrs. peel ...
no, after you.
you do not trust me?
as far as you trust me.
i told mother i took care of you.
you lied.
i equivocated. but you are not their big worry at present. it is dr. darling:  he is disappeared ...
drat. someone wants to implicate you in this affair, mrs. peel. any idea who?
no idea who. no idea why ...
teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys all children's things ...
... or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
quite. any childhood friends? enemies?
not to speak of. peter and i were both loners. there was nobody.
very well. i have a friend who might be of assistance. he is at the ministry. we would better be careful.
I am a wanted woman, i know ...
his name's jones. 'invisible' jones.
why is he called 'invisible'?
you will find out.
are not you coming?
I will catch you up. do not worry; he is expecting you.
talk to the pipe, mrs. peel. that usually helps. do not worry about me being invisible. other than that I am perfectly normal.
i see.
or rather, you don't. learnt the tricks in camouflage. till this accident made a prang of things. how can i help you, mrs. peel?
ah, here we are. steed asked me to play a hunch:  valentine peel.
peter's brother?  but --
half-brother to be precise.
now let's see ... eton, cambridge ... research into robotics and plastics. overtaken by peter's work on the physics of climate change ...
i know all this.
do you also know that during your final experiment, your halfbrother- in-law was under surveillance?
surveillance? by whom?
father. she gave him an 'all clear' after a security test by dr. darling.
who is now vanished.
makes two of us.
are you suggesting that dr. darling and valentine were somehow in this together? but that is absurd.
we must hurry, mrs. peel ...
hurry?  what for?  I am just now --
you did not tell her?
i was getting to it.
getting to what?
the world council of ministers meets tomorrow to convene the new global defense initiative --
i fail to see --
there is a reception this evening. colonel jones thinks it advisable we attend.
have we been invited?
under the circumstances mother did not see fit, but i think i can get you in ...
well, i can not possibly go like this.
what is that you are wearing?
it is called black leather.
intoxicating. here, have one of these.
what is it?
limpet bomb. small, very compact. from trubshaw's.
when all this is over, we simply must get you out of that suit.
you first.
shall we?
trubshaw again? what now?
snuff.  i must insist you try some.
they are playing your song, mrs. peel.
'the merry widow?' i might have known. where is the reception?
oh, hello ...
we want mrs. peel.
dead, I am afraid.
bad news. father's looking for you. where are those bloody ministers?
have a look at this.
I will be back ...
where are you going?
laying in supplies, mrs. peel weather may get very nasty and I have no umbrella ...
you need not bother. i can not drag you further into this. after all, i am still the chief suspect.
no bother. mother and father think I have joined you. i might as well.
but --
oh, and by the way, i think it is about time you got rid of that chip on your shoulder.
if you would been through what i have, you would not --
'x' marks the spot. the shoes were delivered to ... an island in hyde park. surrounded by the serpentine. on the site of a former ministry installation...
... and now?
privately owned by ...
let me guess:  wonderland weather.
very good, mrs. peel ...
i shall need a small plane.
you are not venturing alone, surely.
I am going to find out who killed my husband. will you take these documents to steed?
i was hoping you could tell me.
you are getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. weather's turning very nasty -- and so am i.
I am going to follow up on a hunch of my own. if I am right, mrs. peel is innocent and you have a mole.
where?
in your operation.
I am warning you for the last time, steed: whoever's behind all this, looks like mrs. peel, walks like mrs. peel and kills like mrs. peel.
congratulations, mrs. peel. you have been a worthy opponent. you have tracked us down. you are within an ace of winning.
this is not a game.
quite right, but we still make the rules.
rules are made to be broken.
people, too.
then who wins?
you and i. together. but first you must confront your greatest enemy. who could that be, mrs. peel? the answer is obvious ...
emma in wonderland. welcome, mrs. peel.  we have been expecting you. we hope you will enjoy your stay with us. decontamination is almost complete.
decontamination -- ?
and you have a new wardrobe. he does want you to look attractive.  he tells me you are very beautiful.
would that i could say the same.
ah, but you have not see the real me. watch closely ...
you.
darling emma -- yes, we:  the true genius behind the prospero project ...
a slight miscalculation -- my face was burned beyond recognition. fortunately my research into plastics came in handy ...
dr. darling, peter ... all you ...
an unholy trinity ...
you killed my husband.
for starters. of course i had to kill the teddy bears, as well ...
too many cooks --
spoil the majority shareholders. in wonderland weather. i planned everything, even the ministry recruiting you ...
but i found you. all the clues led me here ...
of course. i planned that, too.
but -- why?
you disappoint me, emma.  can not you guess?  for you. it was all for you ...
'our revels now are ended.'
oh, no, emma. they have only just begun ...
think of this as your second wedding feast ...
I am already married ...
come, come, you are a widow -- a most attractive widow. now i think of it, we will need a bridesmaid. here.
you know, i believe she is actually jealous.
valentine, listen to me ...
right, bridesmaid. now what have i left out? oh, yes, i know: the ring.
ring?
that is better. i say, is not this where you came in? it is impenetrable, by the way ...
you are mad.
entirely. on the other hand  mad people get things done. let me show you --
steed
how did you guess?
you reek of mrs. peel's black leather ...
it was you who gave valentine peel his security clearance ... you are the mole who betrayed the ministry.
mother betrayed me. she was going to replace me with a younger father.  errand boy that is all i was. 'find steed...'
well, you found me. have a sniff of this, why do not you? careful, the scent can be overpowering ...
such as?
destruction of their local weather systems. i can zap a thousand chernobyls into the air.
the result would be ...
chaos. transport paralysis. crop failure.  economic disaster. frostbite or sunburn ... on a massive scale. you have seen a few samples...
then what is stopping you?
one very small thing. a diamond 'cyclone' chip. a thousand times more information on a fraction of the size. if i possess that, my powers would be unlimited. my dear half-brother was developing it. but he suspected sabotage. he gave the chip to ... you, 'mrs.' peel. i want you. but also your ring.
the missing piece of the jigsaw. i tried to get you to give it to me as peter; i tried to steal it from you as dr. darling. as myself I will be a bit less subtle.  with this ring my plan will be complete.
how wagnerian ... do you mean to say you have waited all these years because you could not create a chip on your own? that would have amused peter.
speaking of peter, there is more good news: you will not even have to change your last name. you will always be mrs. peel.
what are my choices?
choices?
I will never marry you.
john steed.
valentine peel. i see you have gone back to using your original face.
the last one you will ever see.
perish the thought.
you are better than i expected.
i was at harrow ...
but did they teach you this?
bang-bang ... you are dead.
you wish.
one shot -- for emergencies.
that is not playing by the rules.
rules are made to be broken.
if you say so.
i do.
you said ... one shot.
did i? my mistake.
are not you forgetting about something?
you are, and it is behind you.
come, come. you do not really expect me to fall for --
i think she really likes you ... where is mrs. peel?
ugh ...
mrs. peel?
what kept you?
the plot.  hello, we must be going ...
'the owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
a fine night, mrs. peel ...
still a bit chilly ...
english weather. you know, after all we have been through, i should say we deserve a long holiday ...
have you any place in mind?
as a matter of fact i have ...
i do not recall siberia being this warm, steed.
it is the latest thing, mrs. peel.
our little paradise -- just made for two?
not quite.
our chaperon.
pity your mother came, too ...
about your next assignment, mrs. peel ...
next assignment?
ah ... sun tan lotion. any shops nearby?
must be. trubshaw's busy. I will send mother ...
ahem. as i was saying, perhaps another macaroon ...
thank you, steed.
