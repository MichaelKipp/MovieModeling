guess who i did it with last night...
roger in op/ed.
who told!
you did. yesterday you said, and i quote, "i have a date with roger from op/ed tonight and i'm going to do it with him."
well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.
computer's down. septuplets story. i need it back by five. hopefully the copy's not a mess.
it is hoped that it's not a mess. "hopefully" is an adverb. it means "with hope". you have it defining the copy, and i'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
well, excuse me for caring about words.
so. you and roger in op/ed.
oh, man! who told?
roger in op/ed. don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
intra office. and they're not dating. they're having sex.
and what is your policy? that if you're not getting any, no one can?
how many times have i fired her?
five-- six--
eh.
hey gus--did you see the story idea i left on your desk?
yeah--the blind foster home mother. it was good. i got cahoon on it.
oh. cahoon. yeah, he's--good.
geller, we've been over this. you're a great copy editor. maybe my best copy editor. you're not a reporter.
you've done five of my ideas.
you know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
they don't have to be in the office christmas show?
a flack jacket.
a--flack jacket.
every tom, dick, and harry thinks he can write. but a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. he's aggressive. grabs the bull by the balls.
you don't think i can grab bulls' balls?
geller, you don't want a reporter's life. they're very--messy. you're all about order. control. and getting me my copy by five.
hey--i can be out of control.
okay. remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
yeah.
you stood for like a month.
forget it.
i swear to god, jos. when is the last time you went on a real live date?
i'm concentrating on my career right now.
do you own any colored underwear? stripes? anything?!
anita!
look. you're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white carter's underwear sexy  if you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
the right guy is out there. i'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
when i finally get kissed, i'll know.
okay. if you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
i've kissed guys. i've just never kissed a guy. felt that thing--
hey monty--you think we'll get any business today?
i'm handing out a free lei to every customer! what do you think?
i think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
change is scary. robbie, let me tell you a little something about the mail business. i've been in it over thirty years. and in those thirty years, the only thing that's changed is the elvis stamp and some gun laws. people are bored! they wanna shake things up!
i thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.
aloha! welcome!
relax, monty. it's just my sister.
that is so--weird that you name your car.
no it's not. guys name their penises.
okaaaay....  that car's going to bankrupt you.
she just needs a new windshield wiper.
because i bought the windshield last week. i'm a hubcap away from owning more of bambi than you do.
rob, take the money, okay? it's no big deal.
no, it is. it's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
better person than i.
see!
i know this woman. she works in admissions at lakeshore community? she might be able to get you in for the fall semester. maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and i could help and--
i'm not going to college, jos. and i'm not playing anymore baseball. this is my life.
this--this is a luau that sells packing material!
someday this luau is going to be all mine!
how can you just give up like that? you had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. don't you want more? to move out of mom and dad's? pay your own bills?
oh yay! and then i could be as happy as you!
for your information, i am very happy. deliriously happy. i lead a very happy life!
my own undercover feature - "written by josie geller".
jos - maybe you should turn it down.
you don't think i can do it.
no - it's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. i mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, jos. look what rigfort did to dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
don't worry, i'll straighten all this out.
but i don't want it straightened out.
geller, this is way out of your league.
okay, just so i'm clear here -- neither of you think i can do this.
jos, that's not what we're --
anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
senorita josie.
and gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
you did.
you knit?
it's just for a couple of months.
you can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! that's like ten years in bambi life!
i'll give you my buick le sabre.
wow. this must be big.
i got an assignment from the paper. i'm going undercover. back to high school.
what!?
do you remember high school?
it was a long time ago -
don't you remember what they called you?
josie grossie.
i know. i came up with it.  you look nauseous.
nauseated. i look nauseated. oh god.
so, you were a geek. big deal.
anita, remember espadrilles?
please. that doesn't make you a nerd. everyone wore those shoes.
the girls threw them at me in the locker room.
okay. that's bad.
at the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
mama mia.  just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. that's why you have me for fashion consultation.
now this is cute.
that is lingerie.
so i was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? i think roger could be the one.
what'd you feel when you kissed him?
bridgework?
very romantic.
how about this?
i am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
cuuuute!
'nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
and we're going to have to do something about your hair.
anita!
jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? how many of us get to go back to high school? you're gonna have a blast!
that is so sad --
i know, like five chickens had to die just so she could look that stupid.
hi, everyone.  i don t think we've met. i'm sam coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me sam.
i'm josie. geller. i think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. josie.
kirsten, that bran muffin has like 75 fat grams.
nah uh.
that'll teach me to wear white after labor day.
umm- i don't think you're supposed to wear white jeans after 1983.
yes you are. a guy. guy. quite a guy. oh my. look at that--i rhymed.  yikes.  bikes!
are you in special ed?
guy perkins and his amazing lemmings. they push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. we've taken to chaining ours together for safety. i'm aldys.
i'm josie. aldys is an interesting name.
when it's not yours. my mom was going through her harlequin romance phase.
try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
never mind.  that is so awful that they hide your cars.
guess. although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
what?
well, do you?
synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "i could eat a horse."
nice.
how long will they watch us for?
until guy tells them to go. once they watched me for like two hours. i found my car the next day in the t.j. maxx parking lot.
why do they listen to guy?
: because he's guy perkins.  listen, you want to walk to na- na's and get something to eat?
yeah. let's do that.
yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? i mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
oh i know.
i'm going to be so happy to get to college. i hear at northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
hey--i went to northwestern!  once. to use the bathroom.
so what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
professor of medieval literature. novelist. weekend flautist.
it's my dad. he worries.  hi, dad. i miss you too.
you're a sick puppy, geller.
it's an expose on cafeteria food.
and you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
geller...you wanna be a reporter? take a look at what sells! sex scandals. bribery. people jumping off buildings. so unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
just so you know, i think they recalled these cars in 1974.
thanks.
sure. no problem.
hey, josie, how are you at calculus?
petty good.
how would you like to join the denominators? the math team could really use a new brain. we lost our best logarithm guy last year.
college?
nasa.  plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. and, i mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the godfather, i think we could offer you a certain amount of protection", if you know what i mean. we all kind of stick together and watch out for each other.
yes.
what?
billy prince is asking you to prom.
why?
i don't know.
the poem! i knew he liked the poem!  billy prince is asking me to the prom.
that's what i'm saying.
what is with this school and prom?
southglen south competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. we denominators don't even go to prom. -but to everyone else it's huge.
aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
this one has been so hyped. we're tied for most wins with northglen north. this year's winner will determine the winner of the century. the theme is everything. so whatever southglen picks has to be totally unique--
whoa. deja vu.
sorry. forgetful.
dorothy parker--
you like her?
i love the way she writes.
not the happiest of souls.  "art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
but i think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. i mean, she was still writing about love, right?
true. i guess she hadn't completely given up hope.  are you sure you're seventeen?
sure, why?
because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. they don't even like people in their 30's.
well, i'm definitely seventeen and  now definitely late--
what's that?
that's the old drive-in. they call it "the court". now it's just a continuous party for guy's group.
sometimes i wonder what they talk about.
yeah, i know.
i mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until i die?
have you ever wanted to go to the court?
are you kidding, josie? it's lame. all they do is stand around and get drunk. it's lame.
it is?
yes, it's lame.
yeah, it sounds lame. why would we want to go there, and stand around?
exactly.
no, i am appalled that i have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- i had to read about this in the tribune.
oh. right.
responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what southglen high schoolers have come to call "the court." seventeen-year-old kristen rey says, "yeah, everyone who's anyone is at the court on saturday night."
kristen got a quote?
yes, urm, she's right. i have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.
have you been there?
uhh, no.
have you been to any parties?
well, how would you define to parties"? because we ordered a deli platter at this one denominator drill session--
this is where the stories are. you are going to become friends with these people. you are going to party with them. you are going to hang out with them on weekends. when they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!
gus i, the popular kids and i, we just don't- i mean, i don't think i can do this.
do you even know these kids?
they hid my car--
get to know them. very well. your job and my job depends on it.
depend on it. no s. your subject is plural.
out!
are mom and dad here?
no. they're at the franklin hint expo at the skokie holiday inn.
good.
no, i mean, no big whoop.
i can't do this.
these girls are high schoolers? damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
gus insists that i become friends with these kids. the popular kids. it's impossible.
why is that impossible?
rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. no one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. you never dreamed about being popular- you already were. all i wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. i can't do all that again. i can't go back to southglen south.
oh my god! you're at southglen south? they have a killer baseball team.
rob. please focus.
jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not josie grossie anymore.
don't you realize how much i wanted to be you in high school? just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
come on! it's not that hard. all you need is one person. once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. everyone else will be too scared to question it.
is that true?
little known fact.
look, don't you wanna show them - gus, billy prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? that you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
yes, desperately.
plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
better than i...
that's the spirit!
george! what are you doing here?
just get in the van, josie.
what is this?
hidden camera.
wings?
we used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"is that why they never give you a second bag of nuts?"
i'm not doing this until i speak with gus.
gus?
no, it's the great and powerful oz. now listen--you're in over your head. this is how it's gonna work. i review the tapes, i find your story.
what if i say no?
i bet good housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
hey, josie, hold on.  you've been hiding something from me.
oh i don't think so.
your writing. it's amazing, josie. you're really talented. and far less depressing than dorothy parker.
thank you.
so what are you thinking for college?
college. haven't really thought about it.
that's crazy. i'll get you some applications.
oh no no no no no. see, my family, we don't go to college.  we just go right into sheep herding.
josie you owe it to yourself to go. for your writing. you're a natural.
thanks. wow. that's--really nice to hear.
josie, you're different. when you speak in class, i can tell--you actually feel the words--  in here. they're alive. like-eurdora welty talked about the word it moon"? how for her it was like a concord grape. "that grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin--"
gus, have you ever been in love?
leave.
oh give it up, gus. i'm just making conversation.
love. who knows what that is? now circulation, deadlines, those i understand.
you should go out every now and then, gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
go away. i have enough work here to last me all night.
listen, i don't have any plans-- you want some help?
no roger from op/ed?
nope.
hey, where's your sweatshirt?
uhh, must have forgotten-
no biggie. i have an extra in my locker. i'll get it for you.
remember, that poet that we liked  the reading he's doing at big cup? i got us tickets.
right. 7:30.
i'm late for lab.
i've been in a horrible accident. this is a coma-induced nightmare.
no. josie, this is real.
are you crazy?! you can't do this.
this is it jos! this is my ninth inning! the game isn't over--i just thought it was!  i get on the southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- i'm into the minors- it's game time!
you're twenty-three years old!
with the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! plus, i'm popular... you want to be popular... i can recognize a cry for help when i see one.
hear one.  rob, this is so like you. you know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day.
oh my god.
dude, you rock!
hi. i'm tracy and i'm sixteen and i'm a gymnast and i don't have a boyfriend...
thank you.  i'm rob.
duh.
what?
last night. 7:30. big cup. i kept calling you, but i only got your machine. i don't even know your parents line and i was really worried.
oh. i forgot.
this seat taken?
thank you.
are you--scared?
i'm gonna tell you something here, and i hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. i'm a little afraid of heights.
you're afraid of the ferris wheel.
actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
oh right. the spiderman incident.
you remember that story?
of course. i remember everything from your class.
yoooooow.
don't look down!
okay this is okay. smooth.  can i ask you something? do you think i tell too many stories in class?
that's what makes you interesting.  as a teacher.
god, i would love to think i'm an interesting teacher. i mean, i had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
you do. seem to. have passion. in the classroom.
you have to say that. you're my student.
i don't have to say that.
boys.
i know.
i'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. some of us will always be rattling cages.
why do you do that?
i don't know. and you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. i've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me.  you know what, i shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
that's okay. it's nice to have someone to talk to--
you have to say that. you're my teacher.
i shouldn't say that, because i'm your teacher.
thanks, josie. this wasn't as bad as i thought.
when are you going to open your eyes?
i'm thinking when i'm home.
hey josie. it's josie, right?
can i just say--i totally love ex- lax.
i think it's pronounced gauche.
yeah it's french. there's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
hi. you're here for the sex talk?
well. i like a man who gets to the point.
you're pam?
if you say so.
hi!

i had a lunch break so i thought i'd come by and see you. your teacher is a fox!  why don't we discuss that after class. but the burning is totally normal.  oh look. class is over already.
i thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
right. right.
wait, rewind. do you really think she hooked-up with our rob? they're so--different.
sometimes opposites attract.
god, i can't do this.
maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
you know what, though? i feel like i'm really ready to do it. to have sex for the first time.
wow. that's big. i mean sex is a really big deal. you shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
you know, adele penguins pick one mate. they spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. that's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
but i'm not a penguin.
now look. let's focus. prom theme. we need a new idea.
oh! how about "under the sea?"
well excuse me.
what about the "roaring twenties" or "the 80's"?
josie, you have totally transitioned.
transitioned?
you crossed over.
into our group.
it's really hard to do. some kids try for all of-high school and never make it.
wannabes. kirsten transitioned last year.
her dad sold a car to leonardo di caprio's uncle and before he picked it up, her dad let us all sit in it and take pictures.
: wait. do you know any gay guys?
why?
we'd love to transition a gay guy into the group.
we're very evolved.
rob's?
yeah, you gonna be there?
he is totally crunching on you.
do i want to be crunched?
by guy?
hey rob, what's going on?
i'm rob's prom date.
really?  rob-, that girl is sixteen.
and a gymnast!
she's sixteen years old, rob. that's totally and completely illegal.
hey there.
hey. there.
rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
well, a ball player.
no, i know. but, what if you don't make it? 'i mean, you don t want to be working at a mail place the rest of your life. it's okay for an after school job, but, come on, "hi, i'm rob and i run the tiki post"?! totally lame.
maybe we should go in a different room?
i already checked. there are some pretty serious couples in there.
i'm sure you've probably heard that i want to ask you, but i'd like to know if you'd go to prom with me. i know we didn't hit it off right at the beginning but-
yes. i'll go. yes.
rufus.  but i don't even know where you live.
you know what?  why don't you just pick me up here? we could all share a limo.
cool. i'll catch you later.
hey josie- who did archie date betty or veronica?
betty.
you're really doing a great job here, josie. i like your "can do" attitude.
thanks.  they weren't related to humpty dumpty, were they? tweedle dum and tweedle dee?
maybe distant cousins. they did have that egg shape in common.
but humpty dumpty was alone.
that's sad, isn't it? he had to sit on that wall all by himself. he deserved to have somebody.
that's really what we all need, right? someone to sit up on the wall with us--
yeah. to watch the world go by.--
to put us back together again when we fall.
our penguin, right?
do you think you'll find her?
yeah, actually i do.
oh my god! i almost forgot--i got you a meeting with the admissions guy from dartmouth!
what! but--i wasn't even going to go to college--
no, i know, but i pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
oh--yikes!
told him  --if i'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
wow. you believe in me that much--
of course i do. josie, you owe it to yourself--to your writing, to go to college. you're a great writer. you just have to find your story.
that's your story!
you're crazy. i can't--i can't-no. no.
it's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
he's my teacher!
and that's the best part.  "teacher-student relations: how close is too close?" we're gonna blow the lid off it!
there is no lid! nothing's going on between sam and me. coulson. mr. sam coulson and me.
not yet. every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! it's like the goddamn young and the restless! rigfort's salivating over it.
you already pitched this to rigfort?!
wow, josie- you look really-
rufus?
yes. exactly. major rufus.
thanks. and what are -
duh. tom cruise. "risky business".
rob--thanks. for everything. this is really happening. i never thought--
i know.
oh-my-god. you totally ripped off my malibu barbie idea.
uh uh. i'm disco barbie.
josie, you look rufus.
who are you guys?
don't tell me... you're medieval barbie.
rosalind and orlando.  from "as you like it"?  shakespeare?
you having fun?
oh yeah. the best. josie takes in the spectacle around her.
are you having fun?
yeah. definitely.
good. gibby gave me champagne.
maybe we should sit.
wow - i-
rob, i mean it. i want you to be my first. me and you. once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
you guys--what is the one thing that could ruin my senior prom?
that you would trip on your barbie heels and i'd get named prom queen?  did i say that out loud?
hey--what are you thinking about?
shakespeare. how he described a night like this--"look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  what about you? what are you thinking about?
my sword.
oh.
josie, you rock my world. you're like the most amazing girl i've ever dated. you're so smart and fun and crazy! you rock my world.
you said that already.
josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
thanks. so do you.
proms always make me sad. they're so final. graduation. everyone's scattering, moving on.
well, are you here with anybody?
no, i'm alone.
it's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". and you can't really promenade alone, can you?
so--have you thought anymore about dartmouth?
yeah, i have.
you ruined the whole thing!
you so do not deserve to be prom queen.
"surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
no, surprise, i thought you'd be--
what? happy? why? because it turns out all along that i was allowed to be attracted to you?
you were attracted to me?
goddamnit, josie! drop the act. do you have any idea what i went through every night because of you?!  i was attracted to a 17 year old! when i wasn't taking cold showers, i was trying to figure out what the hell i was going to do when i couldn't teach anymore! i thought i was the one being unethical.
wait, i was going to tell you--
you set me up. for a story.  you know what's crazy? i was actually considering waiting for you.
but now you don't have to--
now i don't want to! i bought all of your penguin crap. i thought i found her--the right one! and the problem was she was too young! no - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
i did exist. i do exist. i'm the same person!
the person i cared about wouldn't have done this. everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. i don't know you at all. for all i know you could hate dorothy parker.
i don't! look, you could get to know me, again.
please. please don't walk away.
i just can't look at you the same way.
josie, finally. i just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
really?
no- not really, josie. not really. how could you do that to me?  i helped you. i got you everything you wanted. and how do you repay me- you blow everything two days before pro scouts come to see me play. once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.
wasn't even thinking about-
no, you weren't. don't you realize the only time i was really happy in the last five years was when i was playing ball with those guys?
i-
no, shut up, josie. just shut up.
your story was rigfort's baby. we were scooped! we've got nothing. zippo. you totally and completely screwed both of us.
maybe i could talk to rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
i'll tell you a story. it's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter.
josie! josie, how'd it go? did he ream you?
yeah, but i'm okay. i've got some work to do.
you need my help?
no, thanks--i'm doing this on my own.
wow. it's packed.
it's great! they're behind you. they feel like they know you.
it's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
well i'm so glad that you guys are.
i told you you could write, josie geller.
i finally found my story.
