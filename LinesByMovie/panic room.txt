-- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five feet deep, forty-two hundred square feet, four floors with a rentable basement apartment, so five altogether, courtyard in back --
could you slow down a little?  or we could wait for the car...
no cars.  feet are faster.
how many more do we have after this?
none, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.
this is it?  i told you on the phone, i have to be moved in in two weeks.  sarah, please don't bounce that here.
one day you will learn to respect other people's time, lydia, one day you --
evan, i am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!
i don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
no ball, kid.
working elevator.  mr. pearlstine, the previous owner, was disabled the last ten years of his life.  highly unusual, the elevator, you will not find this in ninety percent of brownstones.
will they take asking price?  i need a two week escrow and i'm already approved for the loan.
third floor, spare bedroom, den, what have you.  mr. pearlstine used it as an office.
he's talking about bernard pearlstine.
master bath.
the hotel guy?  it's been in the papers lately.  his kids are all suing each other over his estate. he was a total recluse, paranoid, rich as hell, he was worth thirty million or something, now it turns out they can't find half of it.  somebody took something didn't belong to them!
i hardly see how family gossip is germane to showing the property.
stop calling it the property, you sound ridiculous.
master closet.
could the child please stop that?
kid!  no elevator!
something's weird.
what?
i don't know, doesn't that corner seem funny to you?
a what?
a safe room.  an inner sanctum.  a castle keep, in medieval times.
oh, i've seen these...
it's quite in vogue in high end construction right now.  one really can't be too careful about home invasion.
hey, this is perfect for you...  absolutely!  you're a woman, you're living alone now.  your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night.  what are you going to do?  call the police and wait until they get here on tuesday?  traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out?  i think not!
reinforced steel core walls.  buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house -- you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like.  and a bank of video monitors --
makes me nervous.
why?
ever read any poe?
i don't think so, but i love her album.
no, edgar allen.
the furniture guy?
what's to keep them from prying open the door?
everything's spring-loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional.
open it.
old bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
open the door.
and with kids like he's got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide.
that's highly inappropriate.
i said open the door.
that door is a safely hazard.
not at all.
push that button for me, will you?
don't!
too many stairs.
got us in here, didn't i?
shoulda got an apartment.
well, i know that now.
478-0150.
the phone works.  hey, i hooked up the phone.
the crowd goes wild.
478...
0150.
fuck him.
don't.
fuck her too.
fuck.
i know.
what?
a woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.
fuck!
keep your voice down.
they're not supposed to be here!
this was your department, junior.
they're not supposed to be here!
that's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.
fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks!  they shouldn't be here for another week!  they don't own this house yet!
exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?
fourteen business days.  escrow is always business days.
i mean, right?  isn't it?
you're an idiot.
watch your mouth.
it's okay, raoul.
who is this guy?
raoul is cool.  that's all you need to know.
this is insane.  i'm outta here.
wait a minute, wait a minute.  we can still handle this.  can we still handle this?
it's just the woman and the kid?
unless daddy comes back later.
daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them.  we're okay, here.  we can do this, right?
you're fuckin' a we can do this.
not with me.  not with people.
forty-five minutes.  that's all you said you need.  that's like nothing.
she'll call the cops, they'll be here before i get unpacked.
so we keep an eye on her.  raoul can totally administrate that part.
no problem.
i don't want raoul to administrate that part.
they won't get hurt.
what about us?  what if she has a gun?
raoul, what in god's name do we do if she has a gun?
asshole.
a guy shows you a gun, burnham, and you insult him?  hey, who's the idiot?  huh?
where did you get this clown?
i met him at the tables, same as you.  and frankly, i'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
what tables?  i've never seen him before.
different tables.
the fuck did you bring a gun for?
you're welcome.
peace out.
it's still a good plan.  it's just... got a twist.
yeah.  kidnapping.
not if we keep 'em here.  you can't kidnap somebody in their own house. it's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace.  or something like that, i'm pretty sure.
pure idiot.
i am.  i'm an idiot's son.  an idiot's grandson.  i'm third- generation idiot.  but for once in my life i had a good idea, and i'm not giving up so easy.  you are? are you actually telling me that for the first time in your life you're gonna throw your cards on the table and go home early?  i can't believe my eyes.  fourteen million dollars upstairs, burnham.  you'll be out of the hole. baby, you'll be so far out of the hole you could draw bricks every night for the next twenty years and still shit green.  come on, buddy.  one more hand.
what's going on?!
people.  in the house.
he's going down.
that room!
what?!
panic room!
damn it!
it doesn't work?!
different phone line, i never hooked it up!
can't hear a thing.
what do they want?
i don't know.  rob us.  i don't know.
what do we do?
wait.
what if they get in here?
they can't.  they can't get in here. no.  they can't.
i heard you.
feel okay?
yeah.
shaky?
nope.
chills?
huh uh.
"what we want is in that room."
they're coming in here, aren't they?
no, i told you, they can't.  it's not a possibility.
we're not coming out.  we're not letting you in.  get out of my house.
say fuck.
fuck.
"get the fuck out of my house."
get the fuck out of my house!
oh, please.
give me a break.
got her right where you want her, junior.
shut up.
when you said you'd let 'em go i thought she'd come running right out for sure.
shut up and let me think.
i'm afraid to let you think, junior. things get worse when you think.  oh, that's gonna help.
okay, fuckball, you think.  what are we gonna do?
what if she called the cops?
she didn't.
she said she did.
she lied.  cops woulda been here by now if she called 'em.  besides, junior cut the phones.
what the fuck is funny about this?
god.
there is not one thing funny here.
who else but god could think this shit up?  i spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now i gotta figure out how to get in.  god, man, he just loves the irony.
yes.  yes, it's all terrible ironic and amusing.  you fuck.  now how are you gonna get us into that room?
can't.  whole point.  can't get in the room.
so what the fuck are we supposed to do?!
make her come out.  and when she does, that's when we gotta be careful.  she can't get out of this house.  she can't even think she can get out of this house.  we just keep them here and keep them quiet for forty-five minutes.  and i don't want  joe pesci here standing over them with his fat sweaty finger on the trigger.  that's a sure way for us to end up with two dead bodies and little puffs of smoke burning out of our heads up in greenhaven.  so we're gonna seal the place up.  they wanna hole up in here?  fine, we'll help 'em.  make it impossible for them to leave.  once they come out of that room.
are you freaking out?
little bit.  yeah.
small space?
don't though.
why did the chicken cross the road?
what am i, a five year old?
why did the chicken cross the road?
i don't know, why?
to prove he wasn't chicken.
you can't do that!  you can't freak out like that!  you have to stay here with me!
i am.  i'm here.
you have to!
i'm here.  i'm here.
open it.
i did.
he said open it.
just sending a message.  she'll get the point.
what, what, what is it?!
on the floor!  get on the floor!
be quiet.
we're trying to scare them, not kill them!
they're coughing.
they're gonna die in there!
nobody is gonna die, man, will you please have the balls to follow through with a good idea?  think about it, what would you do if you were them, stay in there and choke to death, or come out?!  huh?  we're just getting them to come out for forty-five minutes, forty-five fucking minutes!  the worst that's gonna happen is they pass out, we drag 'em out here into the fresh air, and they'll be fine.
junior, you gigantic idiot, how are we supposed to get into the room if they pass out?
cut it back a little bit.
no fucking way.
he's right, we can't get into the room if they're dead!
morse code?
dot dot dot, dash dash dash, dot dot dot.
where'd you learn s.o.s.?
"titanic."
got him!
come on, come on...
we're never getting out of here.
shhh...
we're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.
if you think i'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
"half?"  what did you, take a nap in math class?  three people, three shares, one third.  four point six six six repeating.
i'm just saying, the man is a problem.  and he's your problem. wasn't me idea to bring him along.
that's right, raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, i found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  me, me, me, i, i, i, at no point did i say "you" or raoul," got it?
he puts his hands on me again i'll bury a slug in his ear.
no, you will not, because without burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as i'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
don't take no tone of voice with me, homes.
what is this shit you're talking all of a sudden?  you're a bus driver, "homes," you live in flatbush, so please don't start spouting some elmore leonard shit you just heard because i saw that movie too,
do it.
yeah, but where's the third guy?
not in the bedroom.  do it!
if it looks like i can't get back, just close the door.
no.
close it!
cell phone.
shit!
what are you doing?
i saw something, i saw...
strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
blue is phones?
yes, no, i don't know, do 'em all!
call dad!
on it!
he'll do something.
uh uh.
he'll know we're in trouble.  he heard me, i said "there are three..."
he won't even know who it was.
what would you think, in the middle of the night?  i mean, three what, three bears?  he'll call the police.
stop it.
he's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
he --
he will.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
why?
i was trying not to tell you...
what?
i'm dizzy and thirsty.
she's never coming out.
hey.
and we're never getting in.
do me a favor and don't talk.
jesus, what was i thinking?
okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  can you hear me?
i'm dizzy, not deaf.
hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  did you see any sugar in here?  any candy bars, anything sweet?
huh uh.
okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
what if i keep dropping?
not an option.
what if i do?
we're leaving.
the hell we are.
hey man, after all we went through i am not walking out when we're this close.
close?  are you insane?  we're nowhere near close!  fuck this, i'll make an anonymous phone call on monday, they'll find the floor safe, and i'll inherit the shit.  little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
what about us?
suit yourself.
nobody leaves.
observe.
we're not leaving.  i'm getting in that room, and i'm opening that safe.
lookin' doubtful there, big guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
what if i spazz out?
no biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, i just jab you with the glucogen.
where is the glucogen?
oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
i'm sorry, mom.
hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like grandma. you're not gonna have an attack. okay?
okay.
you walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
yeah, whatever.
i mean it!
adios.
you should see the look on your face.
the fuck did you do that for?!
fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me. drives his german car up to 125th street a couple of times, buys a few rounds, thinks he's a tough guy, thinks he knows me.  you don't know one thing about me!
stop it!  stop it!
who's the clown now?  huh?!  who's the fucking clown now?!
me.  i am.
that's right.
burning me.  it's burning my eye.
i have the gun.
yes.
remember that.
please...
what?  what do you want me to do?
what do you think?  get us into that room.
i can't.
you can.  you're full of ideas.  you just need to squeeze one out.
i can't...
you got till the count of three. then you end up like him.
one.  squeeze.
this is ridiculous...
two.  squeeze harder.
i can't just...
th --
okay, okay!  okay.
you got an idea?
yeah.  yeah, i got an idea.  i gotta check something.
are you okay?
hurry up, for christ's sake!
the hell does she want?
i don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  you can wait a half hour, can't you?
yeah.  she can.  she's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. you rest, kid.  half an hour.
you're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  you don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
are you gonna open the safe?
she's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  she just killed her own kid!
it's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  look, look, look, she's telling us.
she's gonna handle it.
she better.
yeah?
everything okay?
huh?
'bout four o'clock.
i don't get it.
somebody called you?
can we come in?
what do you want?
we'd like to come in.
no, you can't come in.
can we come in?
stop asking me that.  i'm fine.  who called you?
you don't look so good.
you wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me i look like hell?  of course i look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, jack.  i'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can i go?
your husband says you said "there are three..." right before you got cut off.
oh, that phone call...
may i ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
huh?
the sentence that started "there are three."  what was the rest?
that's your problem.
that's their problem.
let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
you finish.  then we finish.
-- posed to mean?
you're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  buy one, you get the rest for the same price. you know that.
get the fuck away from me.
the kid in here.  the other two when we come out.
bullshit.
you know how this gotta end.
the walls are steel, right?
not that one.
not that one?!
hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
who the fuck breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
we've got the kid!  we've got your kid!!  what the fuck is she thinking?!
she's got your gun, that's what she's thinking!  the fuck you had to bring a gun for?!
you know how this is gonna go!
fuck you, i'm gone!
-- seventeen feet wide, fifty-five feet deep, forty-two hundred square feet, four floors with a rentable basement apartment, so five altogether, courtyard in back --

come on, come on...
we're never getting out of here.
shhh...
we're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.
if you think i'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
"half?"  what did you, take a nap in math class?  three people, three shares, one third.  four point six six six repeating.
i'm just saying, the man is a problem.  and he's your problem. wasn't me idea to bring him along.
that's right, raoul, it wasn't your idea, none of this was your idea, it was mine, it's my family we're ripping off, it's my prick grandfather who built that fucking room, it was my idea to get the plans, i found the floor safe, and it was my idea to ask a guy who builds these rooms to help break into one!  me, me, me, i, i, i, at no point did i say "you" or raoul," got it?
he puts his hands on me again i'll bury a slug in his ear.
no, you will not, because without burnham there's no way in hell we're gonna get into that safe, so as far as i'm concerned he can paint your ass blue and run it up a flagpole and you won't lay a finger on him, you understand me?
don't take no tone of voice with me, homes.
what is this shit you're talking all of a sudden?  you're a bus driver, "homes," you live in flatbush, so please don't start spouting some elmore leonard shit you just heard because i saw that movie too,
do it.
yeah, but where's the third guy?
not in the bedroom.  do it!
if it looks like i can't get back, just close the door.
no.
close it!
cell phone.
shit!
what are you doing?
i saw something, i saw...
strip 'em, expose the ends, try blue first, blue is phones!
blue is phones?
yes, no, i don't know, do 'em all!
call dad!
on it!
he'll do something.
uh uh.
he'll know we're in trouble.  he heard me, i said "there are three..."
he won't even know who it was.
what would you think, in the middle of the night?  i mean, three what, three bears?  he'll call the police.
stop it.
he's just across the park, this is why we got places so close to each other, in case we needed each other, we're still a family, he'll help us...
he --
he will.
i'm sorry.
i'm sorry.
why?
i was trying not to tell you...
what?
i'm dizzy and thirsty.
she's never coming out.
hey.
and we're never getting in.
do me a favor and don't talk.
jesus, what was i thinking?
okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  can you hear me?
i'm dizzy, not deaf.
hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign.  did you see any sugar in here?  any candy bars, anything sweet?
huh uh.
okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
what if i keep dropping?
not an option.
what if i do?
we're leaving.
the hell we are.
hey man, after all we went through i am not walking out when we're this close.
close?  are you insane?  we're nowhere near close!  fuck this, i'll make an anonymous phone call on monday, they'll find the floor safe, and i'll inherit the shit.  little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
what about us?
suit yourself.
nobody leaves.
observe.
we're not leaving.  i'm getting in that room, and i'm opening that safe.
lookin' doubtful there, big guy, but ten out of ten for attitude.
what if i spazz out?
no biggie, we've been through it a dozen times, i just jab you with the glucogen.
where is the glucogen?
oh, you know, it's uh... it's in the little fridge in your room.
i'm sorry, mom.
hey, quit apologizing, you're starting to sound like grandma. you're not gonna have an attack. okay?
okay.
you walk out that door and you lose your share of the money.
yeah, whatever.
i mean it!
adios.
you should see the look on your face.
the fuck did you do that for?!
fuckin' asshole, thinks he knows me. drives his german car up to 125th street a couple of times, buys a few rounds, thinks he's a tough guy, thinks he knows me.  you don't know one thing about me!
stop it!  stop it!
who's the clown now?  huh?!  who's the fucking clown now?!
me.  i am.
that's right.
burning me.  it's burning my eye.
i have the gun.
yes.
remember that.
please...
what?  what do you want me to do?
what do you think?  get us into that room.
i can't.
you can.  you're full of ideas.  you just need to squeeze one out.
i can't...

i can't just...
th --
okay, okay!  okay.
you got an idea?
yeah.  yeah, i got an idea.  i gotta check something.
are you okay?
hurry up, for christ's sake!
the hell does she want?
i don't know, she keeps screamin' the same thing over and over.
yeah, just like a half hour, maybe a little more, and your mom'll give it to you.  you can wait a half hour, can't you?
yeah.  she can.  she's fine, she's just like, tired, she's gotta rest. you rest, kid.  half an hour.
you're wasting your fucking time, man, you're wasting my time.  you don't know how to do this, and the longer we stay in here, the more likely she's gonna lose it and call the cops!
are you gonna open the safe?
she's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid!  she just killed her own kid!
it's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them.  look, look, look, she's telling us.
she's gonna handle it.
she better.
yeah?
everything okay?
huh?
'bout four o'clock.
i don't get it.
somebody called you?
can we come in?
what do you want?
we'd like to come in.
no, you can't come in.
can we come in?
stop asking me that.  i'm fine.  who called you?
you don't look so good.
you wake me out of a sound sleep at four in the morning and then tell me i look like hell?  of course i look like hell, you don't look so hot yourself, jack.  i'm freezing here, thank you for checking, can i go?
your husband says you said "there are three..." right before you got cut off.
oh, that phone call...
may i ask what the rest of that sentence was going to be?
huh?
the sentence that started "there are three."  what was the rest?
that's your problem.
that's their problem.
let me fucking finish this so we can get out of here.
you finish.  then we finish.
-- posed to mean?
you're here with me, you're already on the hook for one.  buy one, you get the rest for the same price. you know that.
get the fuck away from me.
the kid in here.  the other two when we come out.
bullshit.
you know how this gotta end.
the walls are steel, right?
not that one.
not that one?!
hey man, it's the neighbor's house, who breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
who the fuck breaks in through the neighbor's house?!
we've got the kid!  we've got your kid!!  what the fuck is she thinking?!
