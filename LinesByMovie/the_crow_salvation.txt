why are there so many?
just hold on to me.
what is been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. and I will be seeing her again soon. only what will i say? that i was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? that he is down here laughing?
tell her... we will get him.
we won't.
someday he will surface and I will get him for both of you. i promise. I will find the guy with the scar.
i want to take this to lauren. she would want it.
honey. i just can't.
stay in the car. I will only take a second.
erin. i know you think she is been talking to you.
it is not that. really. it is just... now that he is gone, i think it is time.
i was a friend of your sister's.
i know her friends.
that locket you are holding. you have one just like it.
yeah, no kidding.
your father gave them to both of you.
and he is right over there by the way.  what did you do to your face?
someone else did it.
you are a friend of the guy who killed her, are not you? you almost sound like him.
he did not kill her.
how do you know?
i know everything about your sister. I will prove it to you.
stay away from me! dad! dad!
erin!
watch out!
what were you yelling about?
this guy said he was a friend of lauren's. he had like paint all over his face.
are you ok?
what is that supposed to mean? he was right here. he was!
sssshhh. she is resting.
where the fuck did you come from?
big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator?  all possibilities. although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator.
you lied at my trial.
i do not know you, man.
capital case nine nine dash c one one five. alex corvis.  exhibit a.
hey. i said what i saw. two kids arguing. a guy and a girl.
you said you saw me with this. i never held it until today.
what is your damage, man? corvis hacked up that girl like a motherfucker.
one chance to tell the truth, tommy. who is the man with the scar? he planted this in my car.
there is no scar. corvis made it up.
wrong. answer.
who are you?
what did they give you?
they showed me pictures, what he did to her. evidence. said all i had to do was stand up there and not my head "yes."
what did they give you?
a job. construction. twelve an hour.
anything wrong?
let's hope not. license and registration please.
what is with your friend there?
she's... sick.  actually she never had mai tais before.
but you, you have had them.
not tonight. honest.
if you had a license, i bet I would have seen it by now. how old are you? fifteen?
look, I will tell you the truth. jannie drove us and was supposed to drive us back, she has a license, but i mean... look at her.
you want me to walk a straight line?
i want you... to bend over.
look, can i just call a cab?
what did i say?
that was a fucking hollow point!
i guess it is true. guns do not kill people...
think maybe knives do?
keep that thing away from me.
this is not just some "thing." it is a c zero zero five.
fuck! what do you want?
a scar. on the arm. of the man who planted this in alex corvis's car.
there is no scar, you freak. the corvis kid made it up.
you killed her. i saw it.
bitch killed herself when she shot a cop in the leg. if she' just acted like a girl nothing would have happened.  so you are right, spooky. happy?
what is it?
the cop who found the knife in corvis's car.
what? what is it?
lauren called me that when we were little. daisy. no one knew but us.
honey. it is does not mean anything. it is not a message.
that guy in the cemetery today said he knew everything about lauren.
it still does not mean...
he said he would prove it.
i heard you were looking for this.
you are the guy killed dutton.
i want you to think of me as the guy who killed you.
fuck. me.
what happened to your leg there officer? hunting accident?
not my arm! what you fucking want?
i want lauren. i want my life back. i want... to know why.
why? why is anything happen? it is all money, man. money. the girl just got in the way.
the scar. which of you has it?
nobody.
are you out of your fucking mind? we are going to die.
how can you die if you are already dead?
you are him. corvis.
i was talking about you.
daisy. how did you know?
i told you, i knew your sister.
you killed that cop dutton.
and another one. there. erlich. took a wrong turn.
i know who you are.  that is why you paint your face. to hide.
I am not hiding. I am right here.
you killed lauren! you killed her!
I have been shot, and stabbed and thrown from a car and none of it hurt. but what you are doing now, does. i do not know why.
my dad was right! he said you would ruin her life.
no. listen to me. lauren found out something they did not want her to know.  this.
from the bonfire over there. look at it.
no! why are you haunting me?
because you need to understand. and you need... to be careful.
i thought we had an understanding. i thought we understood that discretion is paramount.
yeah, we do.
shut up.
erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I have got reporters asking me how much he made. I have got the entire force looking at this case now.
i know.
you know.
i know the guy leaves a sign.
tommy leonard. the eyewitness in the corvis case.
some hooker phoned it in. there was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
guy dressed for halloween?
good for you. you do know something.
i think i dropped an earring.
looks like you have them both on.
you are in with them.
it is not what you think.
you killed her!
no.
stay away from me! stay away!
erin. it was not supposed to happen.
they killed her because she found out.
about you.
about them. you have got to leave it alone.
sweetheart...
do not call me that! do not call me anything!
i would never hurt you or lauren. never. believe me.
i do not believe you.
please. come inside.
I am never going back in that house again. get away.
check and mate.
dream on.
two down. two to go.
"down?" wait, do not tell me.
the cops from my trial. they killed lauren. the whole thing was fixed.
you think I am crazy.
I am thinking... that explains a lot.
lauren's father's involved. he bought the cops fancy cars, i do not know what else. it is a company called d-e-l-t. i think lauren found out.
what do they do that they had to kill her?
i was hoping you would find out.
yeah. i sure will.
this is where it happened. right over here.
yeah, i know.
are you ok?
when lauren was missing the police came to our house. they said they were looking for her, right?  but i know now they had her, and the reason they brought her here and knew the could blame it on you...
no...
... is that i sent them here. i told them she came here sometimes. with her dirtball boyfriend. that is exactly what i said.
erin. it is not your fault.
it is all my fault. oh god. i wish i were dead.
no. you don't.
yes i do, i really do.
this tree. here's where it happened.
i do not want to see!
they botched the execution.
could say that.
christ. it was corvis. tommy leonard was right.
fucking crow.
sign of the dead come back to life.
how about sign of a big black bird?
the dead can return, given sufficient motivation. and corvis has that.
cause if you are losing your mind, i got a right to know.
he is looking for something. will not stop until he finds it.  sometimes the best way to get rid of someone is to let them have what they want.
... took everything i ever cared about. left me with nothing.
so you are going to kill him?
have to find him first.
you know what lauren and i were fighting about that night? she had a secret, would not tell me...
my father.
all i knew, she was pulling away. it made me crazy.
i used to be so proud of him. my big deal daddy. and now, he is just a crook. worse even. and the weird thing is...
i wish i could hate him but i can't. he said he would never hurt either of us, and i know it is true and... I am going back.
it is what lauren would do.
do you believe in ghosts, nathan? because there is a ghost threatening us.
you mean alex.
i mean lauren.
because you never accepted that what happened to her was an accident.
you killed my daughter.
an accident, nathan.
she was eighteen years old! there were four of them. they stabbed her fifty three times! where is the fucking accident?! huh?! where is it?!
i watched her grow up. just like you. i know how her mind worked. she kept snooping around because she was worried about you. what you would gotten yourself into. so stop blaming me. and blame yourself.
i do. every day.
erin knows, does not she?
leonard, dutton, erlich. they do not matter. i want the king.
we are getting there. because in his so-called construction job, tommy makes a daily delivery to a place called "the hole."
the strip joint?
i believe they call it a connoisseur's club. owned by delt.
it is ok, it is ok...
it is not. i can not take it.
erin. who?
i do not know. i found him lying there.
where is it? this place?
i think we should get some support?
what? call the police?
we are going to play a little game called "who's got the scar."
what scar? what fucking scar?
aaaank. that is not how we play the game.
you are him! you are corvis! we fried your ass. you are dead, man!
good thing in a situation like this.
fucking zombie.
the scar.
there is no scar. I am telling you.
i hate that picture.
where are they?
can i get you something? a glass of water? a transfusion?
where are they? last chance.
or what? you will bleed all over my carpet?
around, or whatever the hell you are doing here.  what are you doing here?
I am looking for my friends.
see, i heard you were looking for some guy with a scar. how is that going? you find him? yes? no?
how many innocent people did you leave dead back there?
you sent them. i had no choice.
bullshit. you are a killer, that is all you are. a clown with a bird and a rising death toll. you think the world did you wrong?! you did the world wrong.
it was one thing her dad rejected you. but when she did you lost it.
you are wrong.
yeah?  i see doubt oozing out your arm. where do people go when they kill their girlfriends?
just do not believe everything you see.
doubt is a motherfucker.
give me a hand with this sack of shit.
maybe we had a case of that here.  get me my kit.
you two are majorly demented. anyone ever tell you that?
... it connects you to me...
no matter what happens... you are innocent... i promise...
was that it? well, ok.
I am not dying for your goddamn illusions. you got that? you think you and your girlfriend had some rosy future ahead of you? bullshit. she was already bored, why do you think she was looking around? you are nothing, corvis! less than nothing.
in the woods you said you had nothing. but you wouldn't, and i would not if there is some way you do not have to go. please. at least not right away.
erin. I will always be with you.
