for pete's sake, calvin!  we have got guests!
sorry, honey!  i just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
well, put it down and come in!
you bet, hon!
tower. wolf one. I have got a problem here.
say your problem, wolf one. are you declaring an emergency?
stand by. one.
wolf one -- say intentions.
I have got secondaries of an engine fire and I will need to find a clear area to eject.
roger, wolf one. can you make it to the ocean?
I am sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, i think it is prudent that we cut the evening short. I am sure this cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...i'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
we will do this again! maybe next week. here's your hat. could i wrap something up for you? did you have a coat?
it is time.
time? oh, no calvin. it is not time yet. i still have--
it shuts off automatically.
did you rig it to do that? you are so clever.
no.  they all do.
i never know anymore.
you hear that?!
yes.
calvin, i wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. it is not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
i just hope those plates are not radioactive by tomorrow morning.
cheese is particularly troublesome.
worse than your kraft holiday dip?
oh, much worse. but not as bad as that mexican jumping bean dip. you remember that?
yeah, yeah. okay.  give me the roast and watch your step.  I will come back for the radio.
tower, say again!!
the sar helo is airborne with you in sight.
I am marking the 180 radial for five and ejecting.
roger, wolf one.
how long will we have to stay down here?
i do not know. for this thing to blow over, it could take days.
days??
rather safe than sorry. that is my motto!
but, what if i go into labor? that could happen any time.
I have read up on it. I will deliver the baby myself if i have to.
now you listen to me calvin webber, when this baby comes, you are going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
yes, dear!
as long as we have got that straight.
home sweet home!
to you maybe.
what is that noise?
the locks.
the locks?
to keep us from trying to leave. after an atomic blast there is a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
thirty -five years!
then after that it is safe.
it is safe.
to go up.
to go up.
according to caltech, this webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
well, he and mrs. nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
unless we get a postcard or somethin', that is my guess.
what about relatives?
all back east.
the neighbors over there said the guy spent day and night out here. she would bring him sandwiches and hot dr. pepper.
he drank it hot?
yeah.
good god.
yeah.
hi, honey! feeling better?
no.
we have to be strong, sweetheart. if not for ourselves, for the child.
all our friends...
burnt to a crisp.  I have given you the most well-done cut.
I am not hungry.
hot dr. pepper! your favorite!
no, calvin, you are favorite.
really?
maybe I have just got the creeps.
how could you?! this is just like home!
no. no! calvin, this is different! believe me!
would you like a tranquilizer?
you have tranquilizers?
i told you! I have got everything!
oh, no.
what?
uh, oh. now it is time.
honey?
is there a problem?
no, calvin.  babies cry.
I have noticed.
what shall we call him?
no.  i think it is just right.
and i was wondering...if...if i could have a...
yes!
if i...you know...
what? whatever you want, helen!
calvin?!
right here!
we looked all over for you. what are you doing back here?
oh, i was just examining this rear hatchway.
why?
no reason.  well, it is pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. so, you know, when the time is up, we will have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance.  which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
very nice. unless it caved in, too.
yes.  well... yes.
watch this!
what?
not bad for a three and a half year old! I would like to see the public school system match that! i do not care how terrific it is!
yes, he is very bright, dear. much like his father. but you know, calvin, maybe he is a little...young for school.
nonsense. people have no idea what the human mind is capable of. look at us!
yes, you certainly will. and you will find a nice girl and rebuild america. just the way it used to be.
oh, calvin, I am not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can not be kept.
i believe there will be other survivors. in fact, I am guessing there is life on the surface, even now. it is not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something is moving around up there. and i do not just mean the cockroaches.
I am going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
you bet, mom! coming up!
i can not tell the boys from the girls anymore!
uh...yeah. it is like hard.
i miss those nice flower-power kids. how 'bout you?
um...uh...
this is what money looks like.  it comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper.  or you can have an "investment."  these are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name.  of course, they are worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
they are pretty.  can i have them?
sure. now, let's move on to our french exam.
latin exam, dad.  it is tuesday.
you are right!  it is tuesday already! by gosh, time flies, does not it?!
tempus fugit!
en arte voluptus. que les bons temps roul!
gerade aus dann links!
sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
you know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son!  i must say, the acorn does not fall very far from the tree. by the way, it is time i gave you something. come with me.
hi, honey!
hi.
these are wonderful.
it is my entire baseball collection. it is yours now.
what is baseball?
it is a game, son. i can explain it pretty easily. there is a pitcher.
like a painting?
no, son. a pitcher.
like one of mom's?
uh, no. there is a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
the nocturnal flying mammal?
no. sit down.
I am selling this place.  i want out of this hell hole!
could i, like...oh, wow...like,uh...
buy it from me?
yeah!  yeah, that is it!
I will give it to ya, no money down. the neighborhood has gone to hell anyway.
no, no! the runner on second goes to third! he is out there!
why?
because he is forced out at third! it is a force!
then why go there?
because he must!
calvin!
coming!
get the presents and do the lights.
you bet.
thank you, mom! thanks, dad!
blow out the candles!
oh, boy! a jacket!
your mom made that all by herself.
no kidding!
no kidding.  who else would have done it?
and i made these!
holy cow! what the heck are these?!
your roller-skates! i redesigned them! i think this new design will work even better!
these are really swell! i mean swell!
what did you wish for, adam?
if he tells, it will not come true!
oh, that is just a bunch of baloney! we never believed that in my family!
well, we did in my family!
oh. a nice one, i hope.
yes, ma'am.
one who does not glow in the dark.
calvin webber! what a thing to say!
well, we will be going up in two years. we will know then. I am very hopeful.
let's eat our cake.
yeah. let's dig in!
elbows, son.
sorry, mom!
you never know. you may someday dine at the white house with the president.
if we still have one.
yes...
you know, when we do go up...i'm going to miss this old place. how 'bout you, hon?
would you excuse me?
sure.
in the generator room again?
oh, yes.  it just fascinates me how all    these things work.
i know exactly what you mean!  hey, honey?
should we say a little prayer first?
just open the door.
well, do we just go on up?!
no, son! we wait for night.  now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
helen-thomas-webber!  maybe we have been down here a little too long!  please excuse her french.
shit is a french word?
yes, yes it is!
it is an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
yes! that is right!
c'est bon, monsieur.
merci!
you got a light, honey?
what?!  a light!  yes, I have got a light!
good.
so...you...survived the blast, did you?
the blast?  honey, i have survived a host of things. like the song says: "a country boy can survive!"
yes, yes, the song.  so tell me...has it been...hell up here?
"hell up here?"  honey, it is been hell up here, down there and over yonder! hell everywhere.
yes, i can tell that just looking around.  "boy?"  did you say you were a "country boy?"
cute little old man, if you want a boy, i can be a boy.  and if you want a girl, i can be a girl.  i can be anything you want me to be!
really?
uh-huh. and it is all yours for the remarkably low price of only $200! and if you act now, i might even throw in some free lawn furniture.
no, i can't.  I am sorry!  i have to go!  i have to...
I am going to give it to you straight. there is no point in beating around the bush. there were survivors. apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
mutants?!
it is not a pretty sight. some eat out of garbage cans.  others are...cover your ears, son, and hum.  i mean that literally and i mean right now!
others are...multi-sexual.  it seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
no.
yes.
i do not believe it!
they have done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. people throw up in the streets. others point guns. there is something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and i...i can not tell you the rest.  i just can't.
oh my. oh,my, oh my, oh, my. so, what do we do now?
we stay down here.
we do?
yes.
excuse me.
for how long?  we have just about run out of everything!
we will make do.  I am of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
no, calvin.  we are not going to make do.  not me!  not adam.  we are going up no matter what!  we deserve it. even if it is terrible!
well, i am the head of this household--
i want him to at least see the sky!
--and we will--
and the ocean!  a mountain range!
--do as i say!
dad!
oh, no! oh, my goodness!   let's get him into the bedroom.
he seems to be doing all right now.  i do not know if he is had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. but we  need supplies and I have got to stay with him.
I will go up.
I am afraid you have got to.
I will be all right.
you are my brave boy.
i do not know how far you will have to travel to find supplies, but if you can not get home by nightfall, i want you to look for something called a holiday inn. write that down. it is a hotel. there might still be one standing.
yes, ma'am.
right.
i just hope this is still good up there.
mom?
yes?
i was thinking that, uh...you know, while i was up there and all...that maybe i could, you know...try to meet a girl.  i've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
oh, adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. one who is not a mutant...and hopefully comes from pasadena. nothing against valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from pasadena, i do not know...always just seemed a little nicer.
yes, ma'am.
here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
yes, ma'am.
your father has a few final words for you. you know, he would fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. we both do.
heck, i know that mom! you are my parents.
adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
yes, father?! yes?
...the pipe tobacco.
yes, sir.  is that all?
also...stay out of the "adult bookstore."
adult bookstore.  why?
poison gas. invisible. do not forget.
i promise. is that all?
one more thing. if you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
I will try.
are you all right?
yes!  yes!  oh, lord!  yes, oh, yes! but  where is the one who came last night -- all in yellow?!
all in yellow?  oh!  that was my father!
ooooohhhh!!  of course! the father! forgive me!!  can you forgive me for my wasted life?!  everything has been so awful!!
i know it has been terrible.  but it was not your fault. and now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. you understand?
yes.
I have got to go, now.
of course you do.  I will stay here and pray.
that is always a good idea! would you like some money? i have a great deal of it.
no. i do not need money anymore -- i see that now.
how do i leave here?
the front door is open.  will you be back?
i promise.
what?  what is it?!
the sky!!!
the sky?  where?
up there!!
i do not see anything!
just look!!
whatcha looking at?
oh, my holy stars! a negro!
say what?!
how do you do, ma'am.
i do alright.
good!
he is smart.
yes, dear, i know.
is that a birthday cake?!
yes, it is.
gee-ma-nee!
is this because of the radiation?
what?
nothing.
help you?
yes, please.  I am looking for all beef patties.
come on. frozen. how much are they?
frozen, they are six-thirty a dozen in the three pound box.
then I will need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. and that is almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! and my mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! the yacht batteries! the diesel oil! the birthday candles!
you could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
sure.
well, that is great then! terrific...except...it just occurred to me. i do not know where i live! I am lost! i do not know where home is!  would you excuse me?
gladly.
hello.
hi.
how--how much do you want for the mickey mantle, rookie season?
i was thinking of selling all the cards.
really? no kidding?
see, my problem is, all i have are hundred dollar bills and i need something smaller.  ones, fives, tens. like that.
i see what ya mean. tell you what...i'll give you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.
oh, that would be wonderful!
well, we are here to help!
bon soir, mademoiselle!
are you french?
no.  I am from out of town.  I am here on business.
well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
get out of here!
no, you get out of here.
sir? i would really appreciate it if you would not take the lord's name in vain again.
oh, you got a problem with that?
come on, heathcliff, I will walk you to the corner.
yes, ma'am.  but my name is adam.
i did not want to leave without saying how much i admire your jewelry.
hey, smart ass, how 'bout i kick your butt?
where are we going?
we? I am going home. and, judging by that coat, I would say you have to get back to the barber college.
no, I am lost.
you are lost?
say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
forget it.  I am sick of working for that dickhead.
dickhead?
a walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  a dickhead.
what is wrong with you?
i just had a mental picture of...
here, pick these up!
i came on a bus.
why does not that surprise me?
i do not know. why does not it?
well, i guess because I am a little psychic...i have this thing.
oh, that is nice.
let me guess something. this is your first visit to la la land. you are staying somewhere over in hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  right so far?
so far?
yes, I am right?
right.
i knew it! so anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you are out here in the san fernando valley without a clue.  which brings us to here.  correct again?
again.
where are you staying? the holiday inn?
yes! yes! the holiday inn! that is exactly right!
see? I am psychic. not completely, but pretty much. that was pretty good, was not it?!
it was amazing.
yeah. thanks. anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
do you own a car?
I am not taking you there, sweetie. rule number one in north america: no strangers in the car.
if it will make you feel any better, i do not have a gun.
you don't?
nope.
well, that changes everything. get the fuck away from me!!  i mean it!!
I am sorry!  i said something wrong, did not i!  please forgive me!
get away from me!!
wait! please wait!  I will make a deal with you!  I will give you a rogers hornsby, if you will take me to the hotel!
rogers hornsby?!?
he is all yours. i was holding him back.
rogers hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
so what?!  I have got two of him!  and this many dimaggios and robinsons. i was holding these out, too.
so for four thousand dollars, all i have to do is drive you to your hotel?
yes.
and that is it?
yes.
i do not have to take a physical in your space ship?
heck, no!  what?!
okay.  what the hell?  you got a deal. get in.
so...mister andretti, your first time on the freeway?
it is webber.  adam webber.
mind if i change the station? better traffic reports on am.
wait!  wait!
what is it?!
it is perry!
perry?
perry como!  you had him!  go back! go back!
okay, okay!  take it easy!
how is that?
oh, i could die...
over this?
yeah! listen to this part. this is where it really takes off!
you are one scary son-of-a-gun.
hey, what are you doing?!
i know a short-cut.
gee-zooie!!  you better slow down!!!
i can not help it. perry como always does this to me! i just get so cranked!
that was...wonderful!  I have never felt anything like that in my life.
yeah, same here. do not forget your suitcase.
right.
good evening. i want to stay at this hotel.
fill this out please. and I will need a card.
a card?
yes, sir.
of course!
you dial nine to get out.
of what?
the hotel.
i see.  well, thank you very much. you have been very, very nice.
thank you. your father is a smart guy.
my father is a genius.
no kiddin'. well...good night.
good night!  sleep tight.  do not let the bedbugs bite!  that is what my mom always says...  ...who I am really beginning to miss. I am sorry.  it is my first night away from home.
how old are you?
thirty-five.
you do not look thirty-five.
how old do i look?
twenty-five? around there.
i guess living up here makes people look older.
up here on the fifteenth floor?
yes. up here on the fifteenth floor. goodnight.
goodnight.
and lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, adam.  amen.
amen.
i am so glad to see you!!  i thought I would never see you again!
okay, down boy.  i can not take this for driving you home. i wish i could, but i can't. so here, take it back. i could have just left it for you at the desk, but it is very valuable. now take it.
i can't, it is yours.
take it. damn it!
okay.
why are you doing that?
i have not brushed yet.
oh. okay. well, so long. enjoy your visit.
wait, eve, please!  wait.
please do not follow me.  do not do it!
i knew this would happen!  you are like a lost puppy!
can not you please just talk to me for one second?
okay!  damn!
troy? is he your husband? or a boyfriend?
no.
thank-q!
oh, stop that!  god! listen, i know you like me.  i can tell. but you know what? a lot of guys like me.  not me, exactly. it is more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  or some combination of the above.
i think it is the eyes.
the eyes.  okay. an eye-man.  anyhow, it never works out.  okay?  not that you even need to know that!  you look like crap, by the way.  what have you been doing?
watching television in color.
hey, no kidding?  in color?
cross my heart and hope to die.
see, ya.
why does not it never work out?
what?
why does it never work out?  you and...men?
why?!  who the hell knows?!
...okay.
it never works out because I am into legs and butts and hair myself! that is why! so i wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than i am, if you can picture that. now, if you will excuse me, i have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
why not go to work for me?
doing what?
selling all my baseball cards. and helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
food and supplies?  who for?  like starving people?
well, they are not starving yet, but they need help.
how long would you need me?
two weeks.
what is the pay?
what is fair?
I have got to make at least a thousand a week.
you got it! wait here while i change.
sure.
why not buy them milk or something-- instead of dr. pepper?
they like dr. pepper.
who are these people?
my mom and dad.
very funny, smart ass.
hey!  pipe tobacco!  I am going to need all of this! this is swell!
wait! wait!
what?
well, another day, another dollar.  stop staring at me!!
sorry.
pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
hey, you know. i was thinking...
night!
we will have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
it is your life.  and, by the way, it is a dandy.
i guess we will need another locker.
no problem.  we will just sell another baseball card.
you know, eve -- do not get mad, okay? - -  but, I would just be lost without you.
thank you.
and, um ...i guess... i guess you and i, uh...
adam?  do not even think about it. okay? I am sorry.  i know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if i did not say it. okay?
okay.
now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.
there is something else i would like you to help me with.
name it.
well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
oh, I am sure it will!
then forget it.
no, no!  I am sorry!  what is it?
this is for me.
think of me as your genie.  just ask.
well... okay. i would like you to help me find a...wife.
a wife?
yes.
what for?
because i want to get married.
why?!
i do not want to be alone.
you can be single and not alone. marriage bites!
bites what?
the big one!
it does?
sure.
i did not know that.
everybody knows that. ask my divorced sisters. or ask my divorced mom and dad.
they are all divorced?
everybody's divorced.
it did not used to be that way.
i would not know.  what kind of wife are you looking for?
one who is not a mutant.
no dogs, huh? okay.
and if possible, I would like to marry someone from pasadena.
when do you need her by?
two weeks.
well, i could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from pasadena...that could take some time.
that is what i was afraid of.
could we talk about that a little later?
of course.
thank you.
get out!
the engine is still running.
now, get out!!
yes, ma'am!
stop that ma'am crap!
sorry!
you almost got us killed!
i told you I have never driven before!
never drive again!
you said it would be easy!
i was wrong!!
is this your house?
yes!
i like it.
what are you bitching about now?
what are you doing here?
i forgot some of my stuff.
your stuff?  let me see that.
you came back for these?
hey, they are ralph laurens.  and who is this interesting looking fellow?
this is adam.  adam, meet cliff.
how do you do?
i do fine, adam.  how 'bout yourself?  you doin' any good?
go home, cliff, wherever that might be.
shana gillroy's apartment.  remember her?  the model who went to harvard? well, i better get going!  bye, adam. nice coat!
why, thank you!  very nice to have met you, cliff!  may i ask you a question?
he is a former boyfriend. we lived together for about six months.  and yes, I will admit it.  I have still kind of got a thing for him.  that is what you wanted to know, is not it?
actually,no. i was wondering why cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
what?!
eve!  this guy is un-be-liev-able!
i knew you would like him.
darlin', this is x-file stuff!  think about it!  the guy's got all this easily negotiable property. he is obviously setting something up very big.  like a self-sustaining island off the coast of south america, for instance. or perhaps he is the head of a cult that is doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I have heard worse.
you have very nice ceilings.
i do? well, thank you! you like ceilings?
not particularly.
well, i hope you like these! fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. or "nori" if you prefer. i love sushi.
i love lucy!
you nut!
here you go.  one champagne cocktail.
thank-q!
i thought only hookers drank those things.
well, i know mom sure likes 'em!
so, adam...where on earth are you from?
out-of-town.  that is all he will say.
it is a very small place. people do not even know it is there.
and it is called...?
maybe eve can guess.  she is psychic.
really?  since when?
since that guy rear-ended me in palm springs.
oh, yes.
i even guessed his hotel, did not i?
right on the button.
well, dionne warwick, guess his home town.
give me your hand.
oh, my god...
okay, let's see...i'm not promising anything. you okay?
um-hum.
I am seeing...snow... lots of snow. way up north.  are we getting hot?
yes!
you live in...alaska.  the only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you have definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
wow.
that is right?
I have never met anyone like you in my life.
she is right?!
I have got goose-bumps all over me.
why not just go to... nome for supplies and a wife?  is not that closer?
yeah, right!  that is where you would go to find girls!  nome.  he is gay, by the way.
good for you.
well, we try. listen, let me just ask you a few questions.  when did alaska become a state?
1959.
who use to own it?
russia.
when did we get it from them?
1867.  seward's folly. we paid 7.2 million dollars for it. a tidy sum then, as well as now. I am quoting my father, of course.
what is the capitol?
juneau.
hello! it is anchorage!  gotcha!
sorry, that is the largest city.
where is he gone?
he is gone to check your answers on his computer.
he has a computer?
sure.
in the house?
no.  we keep it in the backyard.  of course, in the house.  it is in there.
may i please be excused?
uh...yeah.
this must be very new.
yeah.
it is so small.
what are you talking about? this is the new mac. you a hacker?
i do not think so.
you do not have a computer in your cabin?
no.
how do you get through those winters?  well, you are right.  juneau.  what is the highest peak?
mt. mckinley.  it is also the highest point in north america.
okay, maybe she is psychic.  let's go eat!
that would knock my father out.
yeah?
oh, yes.  it would probably kill him.
he is a windows guy then, huh?
yes. he likes windows.
well, i think windows stink. what do you think of that?
...i guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
true.
but first, you have to start with the clothes!
exactly.  you understand that, do not you?  you have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
all right.
so, what are you seeing?
i do not know.
money is no object.  he is got cards up the wazoo.
the what?
wazoo!  try to listen.  whataya think? surfer, grunge, hip- hop, euro trash?
you are serious, are not you?
what is that supposed to mean?
it means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
well, that is blunt!
I am sorry. but if the shoe fits.
and i suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, do not you?
i see "elegant."
yeah? like ralph lauren?
that is what I am sensing.
the guy with the underpants!
that is boring!
not on him.
I am not wearing his pants.
why not? he has great pants.
i just do not want to.
okay.
alright, i will.
I am busy tomorrow anyway. i have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
what do you think, adam?
about clothing?
yeah.
whatever you two want. if you have got the time, I have got the wazoo.
is not it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
no.
what about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
it is fine. just give it a try. and for gosh sake, eve, take your foot off the chair!
i guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
almost all of them.
the recovery is very impressive.
the recovery? oh , yeah! hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
amazing. I am very impressed.
well, what do you think?
i think...it...works.
let me show you the entire trousseau!
how 'bout it, eve? can he skate around your block?
no.
he is going to kill himself.  go skate out on the bike path! it is that way!
okay!
that water's freezing!
he is from alaska.
that is why little things mean so much to him.
i love this!!
hey, eve!
have you ever heard the saying, "he has not got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
yep.  you know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. everything. until recently i wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
yeah? no kidding. listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
i certainly do!
okay. but you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it is kind of ridiculous, do not you think?
no it is not!
yes it is. a girlfriend maybe. but a wife? i mean...
then just help me find a girlfriend! that is all i ask. I will give you every single card I have got left!
hey, screw you! okay? you think I am just somebody you can buy off! listen, let me tell you something--
would you do it just because you are my friend? my very best friend.
well...yeah. okay.
why did you park way back there?
miss rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
oh. i see.
what?!
ladies first, troy! that was close.
my goodness gracious!  this place is something!
look unimpressed.
no!  not crazy!
do i look crazy?
yes!
just be yourself.
always good advice.
for him. it does not work for the rest of us.
quit showing off!  we are here on business!
good-bye!
i thought i was here to meet women.
not that one!
i like her.
and do not be so obvious!
what have you ordered?
it is a rob roy. a very popular drink, I am told.
what about her?
no way.
why?!  i think she is very attractive.
adam!  she is got bitch written all over her!  you do know what "bitch" means, do not you?
yes, i have a dictionary. but i can not understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  or why cliff would say that about you.
because we are bitches!  look at her! look at the expression on her face! the walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  please!
how 'bout this one?
are you kidding?!  you would not even be a crumb on her table!  you do not see that?!
eve?!
well, I am trying to educate him!  it is nothing personal.
adam,  i think for you, we should go for "sweet."
okay. i like that.
yeah, sweet.  that is a nice way of putting it.
what do i say to miss sweet when i meet her?
um... eve?
it is not so much what you say but how you say it.  women like men who are unpredictable.
really?
yes, really! basically, they want what they think they can not have.  same with guys.  that is why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can not have me" signals!
that is ridiculous.
maybe. but that is how it works.
yeah.  could be.  go say hello, romeo. looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
okay. all right.  and what do i say?
say something surprising. and funny. lie, if need be.
yes! lying is always a very effective dating tool.
okay. thank you, my friends.
what?
romeo and juliet. i cried at the end.
did you?
hi!
yes?
i was wondering if you might help me. i...i seem to have lost my congressional medal of honor somewhere around here.
oh, now, that is a great one!
you like it?
bravo!
thank-q!
this is my new friend...
I am adam webber.
he is really funny!
we work on rodeo drive.  but we are both professional dancers.
really?
you are kidding!
no, I am not! my mom taught me.
your mom was a dancer?
she is a dancer! and a lovely one! you would like her very much! shall we dance?
sure.
go to the bathroom.
right here?  well, you are being so bossy i was not sure!
you wanted to see me!
you are not from alaska!  where did you learn to dance like that?!  and there are no starving people, are there?!
why are you suddenly so mad at me?
do not change the subject! i want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
I have never lied to you.  I have maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I have never lied.
you think I am some sort of sap?! do not you?!
no.  i admire you.  i...i fell in love with you the first time i saw you.  i did. i think that you are the most--
i want to know exactly who you are and what you are really up to!
all right. let me tell you the whole thing. in 1962--
but i do miss that green sport coat of yours.
thank you very much. but, cliff, that is my seat. and i was just--
how 'bout a drink at the bar?
so where is your roommate, the model?
you know, i do not know.  and looking at you, i do not care.  it is been too long, eve.
please excuse this interruption.
oh, brother...
eve, i do not mean to be rude, and please excuse me cliff, but eve, is not cliff just a butt with hair?
what?!
I am sorry, and legs. legs, butt and hair.  well, is not he?  and shallow, as well?
shallow? I am shallow?!
go home, adam.  go to your hotel.
yeah. before i kick your ass.
cliff, i must warn you. i know how to defend myself.
do ya?
stop it, you two!
i guess we should not fight in here.
adam?!
I am sorry.
maybe we should not fight at all. fighting is pretty immature.
it certainly is.  i agree with you completely.
eve? I am leaving.
i do not blame you!
eve, I am sorry.
I am leaving, too.
but, eve, i would--
and tomorrow maybe troy will help you out--because i quit!  this is ridiculous! you are ridiculous! I am ridiculous!
he go back to the hotel?
uh..he might of.
what is that mean?
we did not leave together.
who did he leave with?
what is it to you?!
I am his pimp. he left with the dancers, did not he?
hey, you are the psychic. eve, the psychic pimp.  you tell me.
those sluts!
yeah. but who is not a slut these days?
where are you going?
to bed.
to bed?
yeah.  I am not the one who is in love with the guy.
what?!  now hold on!  wait one damn minute!
in the first place, i do not fall in love with weirdos I have only known for four or five days.
yes, you do.
and i do not fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
uh, yes, you do.
or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
yes, you do!
or have perfect table manners.
you know, i asked him about that. and he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. see, you would eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. i did not know that. i thought it was a way of appearing superior.  know what else he told me?
what?
he thinks that i am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
well, consider the source. i do not even know what a lady is.
exactly! i thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. that is it! if you do not do that, nothing else matters. the cars, the clothes, the houses...
where did he get all that information?
from the oddest place. his parent's told him. i do not think i got that memo.
so now i suppose he is trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
he did not leave with them.
well...i admit it. I am glad to hear that.
he left with sophie.
what?!!
it is true.  she swept him out the door whispering little french things into his ear.
oh, no! not sophie! no way! please do not tell me that!!
what are you going to do? go over to her place and kick in the door?
you are goddamn right i am!
i do not think so.
coward!
eve?!
scare me, why do not you?!!?  you stupid son of a bitch!!!
I am really sorry!
what in the hell are you doing here!! you are supposed to be over on san vicente boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut sophie!!
i know...and I am really sorry.
well, you should be!  thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
what?
goodnight!
eve, if you will let me, i can --
look! I am limping!  how attractive is that?!  what if this is for life?!
i know first aid!
well, you had better!!
there.
thanks.
i went to sophie's and she was very hospitable.
is that what you call it?
but it just was not where i wanted to be so i left as politely as i could and found a taxi.  but i asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel.  there is a song mister como sings called "on the street where you live."  you know it?
sing it to me.
"all at once am i--several stories high-- knowing i'm--on the street-- where you live."  it is about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves.
adam...dumb question, but humor me. have you ever had sex before?
no.
uh-huh. adam?
yes, eve?
i want you to go back to the hotel now.  I will call you a cab.
of course.  i should not be over here at this hour.
that is right.  and I will see you in the morning in the lobby.  do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
not at all.  and eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. my first.
my pleasure.
it was at least as good as the sky.
really?  okay!
and i think better than the ocean. I am serious!
neat. goodnight!
I am sorry. i took the lord's name in vain again, did not i?  I am so sorry.
no!  there is an adult bookstore back there!  I will be right back!
okay, troy!  let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
how 'bout we check with eve first?
you bet!
so, did you buy a movie?
what?
a magazine?  a toy perhaps?  in the bookstore.
no, i would not go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
i know what you mean!  i usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
does that work?
yeah...seems to.
hi, eve!
hi, adam.  this is, uh....
I am nina aron, adam.
how do you do?
very well, thank you. I am with the county family services department. eve tells me you have been living in a bomb shelter most of your life.
fallout shelter. there is a difference.
adam, I would like to introduce you to my associate -- mr. brown.
we want you to come with us so we can talk some more about your experiences.
come where?
my office.
for how long?
well, that depends...
i thank you very much for the invitation, but I am quite busy today. perhaps i could see you tomorrow.
adam....you should go with dr. aron. it is the best thing.  the best thing for you. i promise.
...all right, eve.  if you say so.
...i do.
could i please just go home?  i was lost, but this morning i found home and i promise not to bother any of you ever again.
let's go talk first, adam.
yes, ma'am.
good-bye, adam.
goodbye.
well what was i supposed to do?! he wants me to live underground with him! that is like silence of the lambs, do not you think?!
i know...i know. you did the right thing.
oh, no!
what?!
oh, my god!
he will catch him.  hi. this is nina aron.  I have got a run away and I am going to need police assistance.
no!  not the police!  do not call them!
i have to. if a complaint is made and the person resists obser--
no, i can not have that! they will come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
calm down, please. this man needs help and you need protection from him. that is obvious.
you know, i do not think so. I am confused but you know, i do not think he would ever hurt me. i do not think he would hurt anyone.
and now you must let me be the judge of that!
i was frightened and i did not know what to think! but you know-i believe him. i think he just wants to go home. wherever the hell that is...
let's all remain calm. that is the key thing.
the key to my hotel room!  i want you to have my baseball cards!  and please be sure to pay my bill!
young man, stop right there!
bye, troy!
bye, adam!
and thanks for always being happy!
what?
gay.
oh.  well, you're...certainly welcome!
good god...you do not think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
fallout shelter.
I have got almost everything we need! and this nice man...
archbishop melker. we met earlier.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  but we have got to hurry.
are you in trouble, son?!
i think I am being chased by a psychiatrist.
a psychiatrist?!
what do you want to do with it?
give it back to him.
and if we can not find him?
we will find him.
what is wrong?
i do not know.  everything's so neat. it is all just so...goddamn dear.  damn!
see these?  found them in the box with the cards.  these are stock certificates.  ibm.  at&t.  polaroid.
millions upon millions upon millions! the cards. the stock!  the clothes! the toothpaste!  the guy was on the level!  and you blew it!  a man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! and what do you do?!
have him committed.
yeah! that is thinking.
he was always so "nice"! how was i supposed to know that is a good thing?! "nice" is weird! nice is...what is "nice"? it is not cool! I will tell you that.  was it ever?
i do not know. i like to think so.
well, at least i fell for him before i found out he was rich! that is new.  wait a minute! he said today he knew where home was. what happened this morning?! where did you go?!
to get some frozen poultry.
then what?
we came back to the house!
you did not stop anywhere else?!
no. no, wait a minute. we stopped at a porno store.
what?!
an adult bookstore. he was very excited about seeing it. you think home is under a dirty bookstore in the valley?
come on.
why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
none of this stuff was here in 1962. the valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
well, we have come a long way, have not we?  i want to go home.
yeah.  maybe he will call.
adam!!
where?!
stop!
how long will you set it for this time?
i thought ten years.
well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  i was wondering, calvin, why set the locks at all.  i mean the radiation is gone and...
to keep what is up there from getting down here! it is not the radiation I am worried about.
well, please excuse us!  we...we have not entertained a guest in...um...
some time.
what can i offer you, eve?
mom?  eve and i have to go.
what?
i can not explain it now.  but i want you to set the locks for two months. you have more than enough of everything.  then we will be back to get you.
but, i do not understand.
and, I am asking you to trust me without understanding why.
well, in that case...of course, son.
we have to go.
no, wait! at least stay for dinner!
no.
see! i can not tell them that!  i can not ever let them know. it makes their life..well, frankly... a joke.  i can not let that happen.  you understand?
we can make this work, adam! believe me! I am very good at making things work!
my mother's like that.
this is your bedroom?
no, mom, I have turned it into dad's office.
well, where are you --
eve and i...eloped.  we are married.
no.
yes.
this is great son, just great. by the way, eve's last name. rus-to-kov, that is not russian, is it?
it is ukrainian. her grandparents immigrated here.
uh-huh.
dad, i do not know how to tell you this. and i was going to wait a while, but i think...dad,there was no bomb. a plane crashed into our backyard. i looked it up in old newspapers.
you are sure?
positive. the soviet union collapsed without a shot being fired. the cold war is over.
that is what everybody believes?
yes, sir. it is true.
what? did the politburo just one day say - "we give up?"
yes. that is kind of how it was.
uh-huh.
my gosh, those commies are brilliant! you have got to hand it to 'em!  "no, we did not drop any bombs!  oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed!  poor, poor us!"  i bet they have even asked the west for aid!  right?!
uh, i think they have.
hah!!! those cagey rascals! those sly dissemblers! those, uh...  they have finally pulled the wool over everybody's eyes!
