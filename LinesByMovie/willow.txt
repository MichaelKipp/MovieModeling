it is not a nelwyn baby.
no, it is too big to be a nelwyn baby.  it looks like a daikini...
can not we keep it, dada?
absolutely not.
sir!  i have to talk to you.
not today, willow.
it is a matter of great importance to me!
earlier today you tried to tell me something, willow.
my family found this baby in the river, high aldwin.
dada, what is a daikini?
daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
are you scared?
i could be you rguard!  i could carry your spear!
what a great son you are, ranon.  i wish i could take you with me.  now go to sleep...
now, you know where you are going?  down there, through those trees, follow the river.  you will know the crossroads by a big daikini struc- ture.  willow, this is serious business.  do not waste any time, the outer world is no place for a nelwyn.  give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.
if I am not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can i do this?
you are strong enough.  but you are going to need courage, willow.
i do not want courage.  i do not want to be a warrior.  all I have ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
real magic, willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others.  you lack faith in your- self.  you must learn to trust your intuition.
go in the direction the bird is flying.
oh, if i could do that i'd--i'd turn burglekutt into a toad!
waste magic on revenge?  you have much to learn, willow...
please?  I am dyin' of thirst in here.
good.  how long will it take?
do not make me angry, peck.
you be careful.  I am a powerful sorcerer.  i could turn you into a toad just like that.
miserable pecks.
do any other daikinis ever come by here?
why.
i have to give this baby to some- body.
hey!  somebody is coming!
peck!  quick!  douse the fire!
thanks for your help, peck.
are you okay?
as if you care.  i saved your life, peck.  those guys woulda killed us!  you wanna give your baby to them?? they eat babies!
i do not know.
you a woodcutter?
farmer.
farmer!  i knew it!  you are a vic- tim, willow.  yep, you and me: victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor- rupt, rotten world.
you all right?
these burns.  my arms.  ouch...
smells like a battle.
are you a warrior?
the greatest swordsman that ever lived.
what is that?  i hear something!
you hear trouble.
what is it?
we are going into battle, little one.  find a woman to take care of it.
he thought you were a woman, airk!
madmartigan!  what did you do this time?
nothing you would not have done it my place!
i always knew you would end up in a crow's cage.
least I am not down there herding sheep!
airk!  come on, airk.  lemme outa here.
hey, remember?  you do not need my help, madmartigan.  little rabbit trap like this?  come on!  i could open it for you, but i would not wanna insult you!
gimme a sword, airk.  I will win your war for you.
I will be around long after you are dead, airk!  you slime!  when i get outa here I will cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
friend of yours?
whatcha thinkin' about, willow?
i hate this.
nobody's going to take your baby. know why?  nobody cares...  except me.  you wanna go back to your farm. you wanna go back to your family. i could take care of that baby. I will look after her like she was me own.
you do not know anything about ba- bies.
you gotta promise to feed her.
i will.
fresh goat's milk.
absolutely!
and give her a bath everyday, and do not let her get cold.  and keep her diaper changed.
of course!  i promise!
here are her diaper rags.  and this is her milk bladder.  and when she cries--she's either hungry or she is tired--rock her on your left shoulder.  she likes that.
do not worry, willow.  she is in good hands.  you have not made a mistake.
we are emissaries of her majesty, queen cherlindrea, of the land of coshairm.
queen cherlindrea?
she requests the presence of your- self and the young princess.
who??
you are the guardian, are not you?
elves!  they are always tormenting babies.  they make them cry and take their tears.
somebody has to do it.
I am getting her out of there!
no!  you let us handle this.  come along, rool!
watch this.  right between the eyes.
he never misses.
ohhh, i hate this.
take your time.  do not worry about the elves.  they will not come out here.
why not?
this is not going well.
hurry!  queen cherlindrea will know what to do.
willow ufgood.
yes...?
i hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom...
talk!  say something!
i can not see anything--she's too bright!
you mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
she belongs to all of us.  she is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
no, willow.  your journey has just begun.  it has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of queen bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  upon you depends this princess's life.
me?
you are the guardian, willow.  you must take her to tir asleen.
what is tir asleen?
the way has been lost in time. but there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. she was exiled by queen bavmorda many years ago.  her name is fin raziel.
you need a warrior for this job. I am nobody.
you are very important, willow.
no I am not.  have you really looked at me?  I am short!  even for a nelwyn!
why can not you do it?  you have mag- ical powers.
my prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  but i can give you these...
they look like acorns.
anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
hey, careful there!
how do these work i wonder?  i got- ta save one to show the high aldwin.
I am not going in there.
me neither!
you!!
where the hell did you come from?
hey!  give me that baby!
these pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
nursemaid?!
time to change her diaper.
time to leave.
you!  are you the mother of that child?
no.  i mean yes.
i can't.
let me see it.
i can't.
why not?
why not?
because she is sick.
because she is sick.
gawd...you're...beautiful...
you are not a woman.
where is the baby??
i thought you had her!
now willow, i know you are going to blame me for this but it was not my fault...!
elora danan!
when i left the crossroads, i got ambushed by an elf!
madmartigan!  you saved her life!
i did?
so you are on your way to tir asleen, huh?  i hate to tell you this, willow, but tir asleen dosn't exist.
yes it does.  the fairy queen told me.
the fairy queen?  and the baby here's a princess?  and these two rodents are your guides?
madmartigan, i need your help.
my help?  a great magician like you?  you do not need any help.
i was in love once, willow.  she had a hold on my heart.  i could barely function.  i *was* a great swordsman!  i was knighted!  i could have been king!
you?
yeah me.  king!  but she betrayed me.  she robbed me of my dream.
are you sure?
yes!  raziel!  she lives out on that island!
its branches are supposed to be made of gold, solid gold.
how are we going to get out there?
we have traveled a long way.  we are looking for fin raziel.
the sorceress.
obviously.
without raziel we will never find tir asleen.  we would better go.
who are you!  who are you!
I am willow ufgood.  I am here to find fin raziel.
this can not be right.  this is not a sorceress.  this is some kind of animal.
queen bavmorda transformed her.
what do you want!
we need your help.  to take this baby to tir asleen.  she is a prin- cess.
kill him!
no!
kill him!
we gotta follow them.
us??  we will never catch them.  any- way, we are all done, teemo.  let's go home.
get back here, rool!
ouch!  let go of me!
willow, why do not you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
he is no magician.
he turned that monster into stone!
did *you* give that acorn its power?
no.
a magician *makes* magic.  any fool can use it.
then you get us out of here.
i will!  but i need help!
I will help you...!
i won't.
you must learn magic.
that is all i ever wanted!
then i will teach you.
if you rest the baby on your shoulder, she will stop crying.
shut up.
mmmm, i love the smell of a woman.
my step-father's going to tear you apart.
who is that girl, anyway?
sorsha, queen bavmorda's daughter.
willow.  to learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
what do i need for that?
we must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.
i hope she is all right.  how much more do i have to do of this?
till it is in a powder.  the energy exits within you...
i know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self.  but what is this got to do with it?
as below, so above.  you hold the univers, willow, in your hand.
I am beginning to think you two *deserve* to be locked up.
the universe is a living creature, like you and me, madmartigan.
we are a tiny version of all that?
as above, so below.
I am all finished.  now what?
burn it to a fine ash.
how am i gonna do that?
patience.  concentrate.  you will find a way.
she needs to be changed.
i changed her already!
she needs to be changed again. sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as willow changes the baby.  soon the baby stops crying.  re- lieved yet still anxious, sorsha paces to a mirror. willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire.  then his eyes focus on the fire.
who is that horrible friend of yours?
madmartigan.
who is he?
i do not know much about him.
she is hungry.
i know she is hungry.  i tried to feed her but she would not eat a thing.  I am not a wet nurse.
here.  hold her.
did she ask about me?
who?
come on, peck, do not give me a hard time.  you were in her ten all night.  did she say anything?
she said lots of thing.s
willow!
she asked about you, madmartigan.
well what did she say?
she is in love.
you are crazy.  i think you are in love.
we do not have much time left!  go on!  go on!
i must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
what is the magician's weapon?
the limitless power of...
your will!  your will!  what else could it be?
i can not remember all these things. what am i learning?
the art of transformation!
but what am i gonna transform??
me!
you?
what are you gonna become, raziel? queen of the rodents?
i do what I am told.
too bad you are not more like your father.
oooh, this smells terrible.
that is the life spark.  exxence of magic and sorcery!
ouch!!
shhhhh!
what did you bit me for!!
we need blood.  to nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
again:  what is the magician's weapon?
his will.
now use it.
i just wanted to test it first.
no!  change me back into a sor- ceress, willow.
you are a fool.  now put her back.
I am not going to let this baby die.
why did you say that?
say what?
i love you.
because it is true.
i do not believe you.
you left me to die, friend.
you managed alright.
is this what is left of your army?
it is you they are after, madmarti- gan.  what did you do this time?
they are not after me.  they want the baby.
you going to be a hero, madmartigan? I have lost half my men fighting kael, and bavmorda, and the nock- maar army.  now you and this peck, and that magpie up in the rafters, are going to take 'em on alone?
then come with us.
you are chasing a dream.
just get me some horses.
madmartigan!  i can not stand being in closed-in places.
want me to carry elora?
I am used to her.  how is she doing?
willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if raziel's wrong?
she can not be wrong.  she is a very very very powerful sorceress.
she is a bird, willow.
that is my fault, not hers.  I have got to keep practicing.  I am still in the learning stage but magic, madmartigan, requires concentration and--
watch it!
ahhh!
tir asleen.
there is nobody here.
how??
use the philosopher's stone!  hur- ry!  invocation!  release them!
i did it!  madmartigan!  come here! look!  you gotta see this!  i did it!
more!  more!
raziel!  i transformed them all! I am a magician!
you did not transform them, willow, you released them.  that was noth- ing.  now change me.
sorsha.
madmartigan.
out for a little ride in the coun- try, airk?
thought you might get lonely, mad- martigan!
thank you, friend.
let's go.
get down!  the ritual chant! quick!  protect yourself!
why?
just do it!
I have come all this way and now elora dana's going to die!
no!  i can still defeat bavmorda!
she is too powerful, raziel
bavmorda cannot transform you. I have protected this camp with a spell.
can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, raziel?
i have an idea.  back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
i know, i know!  but this is a way to get into that castle...
i do not know, willow.
madmartigan, you promised me you would take care of elora danan like your own daughter.  she is all that matters.  are you going to abandon her?
we will probably die here, sorsha.
i have no family.
time is running out.
surrender!!
patience, willow.
courage, willow.
