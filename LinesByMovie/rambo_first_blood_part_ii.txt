hello, john.
colonel.
mind if i sit down?
i hear you are not enjoying it here.
i could take it or leave it.
seems like I am always pulling you out of some goddamn toilet or other, does not it?
am i out of here?
that depends on you.  christ, look at you.  i give you this easy duty until i can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it rambo's last stand.
there were treating me like a headcase.
hard to believe.  you shoot up one little town in oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun... one little dogpatch town... and everybody figures your wrapper's broken.  no sense of humor.  what did you expect?  an engraved plague from the chamber of commerce?
this your stuff?
that is it.  my life.
hardcore outfit.  the best i ever trained.
those men are all dead.
you are not.
congressional medal of honor.
yeah.  big time.
plus, what else?  two silver stars, four bronze stars, two soldier's medals, four vietnamese crosses of gallantry and... uh, a handful of purple hearts.
five.  i never wanted that stuff.
what did you want?
i just wanted... i do not know... after all that... i just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, john." and mean it.  that is all.  after all that.
you just picked that wrong war to be a hero in.
i do not work with spooks.  not after that op in cambodia.
I am authorized to get you out of here.  i thought that is what you wanted.
what is the job?
classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  two men.  two days.
why me?
we like you.  at least the computer at langley likes you.  pulled your file because of various factors.  service record. area familiarity.
where?
not yet.
I am not jumping blind.
we left some people behind there, john... pows.
this just occurred to somebody, now?
memo e-7 on top will cover the details.  an abandoned vietnamese army base in the north-central highlands may have a compound used as an internment camp.  as you can see the intelligence is soft.  these landsat photos show huts... barracks.  it could be anything.
what is the plan?
this operation is in two phases. recon and rescue.  you are phase one.  your two-man team will probe the site, confirm the presence of american pows, if any, make photographic and tactical observations, then proceed to the extraction point without engaging the enemy.
we do not try to pull out any of our guys if we find them?
negative.  absolutely not.  the phase two assault team will get them out.
we just take pictures?
do not look so disappointed.  it should be hairy enough... even for you.
this clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I am not jumping with him.
clown?  now back up there, buddy...
listen up.  you two are married as of now.  get used to it.
i say we tape him to a chair.
i did not know you were a stick man, rambo.
i was crossed-trained in gunships.
how long have you been setting up?
about 22 hours on site.
nice work.
all this is for us?
that is right.
ever do this from a jet?
no.
how long before you are fully on line?
couple hours.  let me buy you a coffee.
you think they will find any?
pows?  i do not know.  but either way it will get that subcommittee off our necks.  cream?
black.  no sugar.
the league of families leans on congress.  then they lean on us. like we do not have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  damnit!
again.
insertion.  call in to base camp by transat.  proceed to point tango november for rendezvous with our ground contact.  indigenous agent. co phuong bao.  we have been over this three times.
you stopped.
co phuong bao.  the guide takes us twelve klicks upriver to target at ban... at ban... bo peep.  shit!
start over.
... to target at ban kia na.  we probe the site...
ninety.
... then proceed downriver to extraction at point echo delta. doyle takes us out by helicopter, we all live happily ever after and that is the last time, rambo!  i swear to christ.
one hundred.
gettin' old, huh?
yeah.  second set.  let's go.
no radio source.  nothing for the bad guys to triangulate on.
show me how it operates.
that is what I am here for.
show me in case you get zapped as soon as we land.
we are leaving tonight, not in a week.
yeah.  why not?
you break your leg, I will have to shoot you.
let's do it.
keep it clean, rambo, or I will nail your hide to the shed.
you got it, sir.
you read me, brewer?
read you.
home on my strobe.
you okay?
keep it down, man.  i got problems.
what do you call that?
modified m-16 a2 and over-under m-79 grenade launcher, with sionics sound suppressor, tracor starlight scope and lac/r-100 laser sighting system.
batteries not included.
this is state-of-the-art firepower.
what is this?
ac-system 'big-ear' telescopic mike with built-in audio processor. can pull a whisper out of a loud cocktail party at 50 meters.
cocktail party.  uh huh, right.  let's saddle up.
where is your stuff?
that is it?  some c-4, a map and a knife?
there is a compass in the handle.
and a beat-to-shit ak?  every twelve-year-old in nam's got one of those.
exactly.
you wanna know why i stood up for this show?
no.
i was in the brig.  they gave me a deal.  i blew up this colonel's golf cart with an m-19.  he was not in it or anything... it was the symbolic value.  seemed like a good idea at the time.
that is a real good reason to wind up in 'nam.
I have seen worse places.
there are no worse places.
this place is a trip.
buddhist monastery.  fifteenth century.
damn!  leeches.
you fucking crazy?  i need it to burn these things off.
no cigarettes.
i had it cupped.
I am rambo.  this is brewer.  her name is co.
it means "virgin."  my mother was comedian.
you really got a masters degree?
sure.  i only sound like forty-year- old in your language.
what is this stuff on the rice?
fermented fish sauce.
how do we get upriver?
i have arranged transportation.  we meet soon.  but i think you to be disappointed.
why is that?
i go up to this camp two months ago. nobody there.  empty for years.
why would they send us to a deserted camp?
who cares?  let's just do it and get out.  go have a jacuzzi and get laid in bangkok.  know what i mean?
we will check it out.
how come we did not just drop near the camp... save this hassle?
brewer.  does a jet make noise?
yeah...
where did you find this clown?
i thought he was with you.
crazy motherfucker.
what is she saying?
she likes you.  says you are dinky- dau.
what is that?
powerful warrior.
yeah.  dinky-dau, that is me.  hey, co.  you wanna meet jake the one- eyed snake?
these guys look like they would sell their mothers.
sometimes they do.  they are river pirates.  opium runners.
pirates?  no kidding?
what is up?
listen, kirkhill.  I am a bit of a fifth wheel in your setup here... i thought I would go out with the extraction team tonight.  unless you have an objection.
it is not necessary.
i know.
that is a pretty hairy ride.  full colonels are supposed to be above that sort of thing.
i know...
have fun.
how did you get started working for the spooks?
spooks?
intelligence work.
oh.  they talk to me at university before fall of saigon.  make deal.
nguyen.  he twelve now.  not see him for eight years.
where is his father?
where is nguyen now?  what city?
huntington beach, california.
it is nice there.  he is probably digging every minute.  got a surfboard.  breaking girls' hearts.
nguyen is good boy.
how you doing, brewer?
i need a vacation.
snoring.  five, six guys. mumbling... vietnamese.  somebody talking in his sleep.  a toilet flushing.
guard barracks.  take some shots.
it is a guy in a cage.
american?
can not tell.  pretty tall.  he is real scrunched up in that thing.
let me see.
roundeye.
alright.  home run.
torture cage.  can not stand... can not sit... for days.  sometimes weeks.
bastards.  let's get some shots.
that guy's not going to make it.
nothing we can do, man.
I am getting him out.
what?  are you crazy?  we are supposed to take pictures and split. you are going to blow the whole program.
you never been in one of those things.
i suppose you have...
it is orders!  you remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it.  john wayne is dead, man.
you take pictures and split.  I am going in.
who are you?
american.  come to get you out.
man, you are one scary-looking motherfucker!
can you walk?
i could a couple of days ago.  gonna be... stiff.
what is your name?
de fravio.  dave de fravio. lieutenant... air force.
you guys are real... are not you?
huh?
sorry, i mean... i talk to people all the time... i know a lot of them are not there.  but this is real, is not it?  you are taking me home now?
that is right, buddy.
alternate lz zulu sierra at 0500. it says "may have heat.  do not be late.  all our love."
let's get that tent down!
i got to tell you, it is just luck you guys came when you did.  they move us around a lot... we only been at that camp a week.  got a smoke?
no.
what kind of raggedy-ass rescue you call this?
you mean the snake?
yeah.  it is not hard once you get the hang of it.  in the wrist. anyway, i did what i always do when i get one...
what is that?
put it in the guard's barracks.  man they got pissed.  they beat the crap out of me, but... it is kind of a tradition.  you oughta see 'em run around.
wow!
what just happened?
are you okay?
yes.  but i lose many merits in next life.  very bad.
why did they want us?
they heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  make deal.  more than we pay.
thanks.
rambo.  nva coming.  pig dog kinh say meet them here.  whole garrison from con cuong is out.
let's go.
you better take off.
am not you coming with us, sweet thing?
stay on your heading, captain.
sorry, sir.  can not do it.
that is an order.
sorry, sir.
you pathetic scum.
well, if there were not pows before, there are now.
take your time.
look, colonel... we are all adults here.  this is a war.  a very quiet, very intense war.  people get sacrificed.
not my people.
but you are right... some people do get sacrificed.  now tell me why you pulled the plug.
you think I am some whacko?  i like to hurt people?  I am doing a job here.  if i knew what is right or wrong I would be a goddamned priest, right?  so i follow directives... i do what I am told.  it is simple.  if your boy had done what he was told, there would not be a problem.
do not dance me, kirkhill.  you will be walking funny.
look, it was a screw-up, alright? they were not supposed to find anything.  we thought that camp was empty.
this mission was a scam from the word go?
word came down... they wanted an answer.  and they knew the answer they wanted: no pows.  but it had to look good.  best effort.  the whole dog-and-pony show.
rambo and brewer were selected as write-offs.
it was clean.  very clean... rambo was a decorated vietnam vet, a former pow himself... if he came out and said "no pows" the sub-committee would buy it.  he gets himself caught he is a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  if he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and d.c.  airtight. but no... rambo's got to be a hero. thinks he is starring in his own war movie or something.  he put me in a corner.  no choice.
"terminate with extreme prejudice."
that is a crock.  we do not say that. do you have any idea the shitstorm if he would gotten back with that guy? if it went public?  the white house would have to act through channels. we are talking ransom.  four billion bucks in war reparations to vietnam to get the others back.  that is billion, colonel.  with a "b".  for a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  a pain in the ass to everybody?  no way. there is no way.
so there never was a phase two rescue team?
of course not.  you can not get approval to rescue a kitten from a tree after tehran.
you are out of your depth, trautman. way out.  I am acting correctly here. not you.  not your gung-ho jungle ace.  it is over.  walk away.
it is not over.  you made one mistake.
what that?
are they going to torture us?
yes.
what... whattaya do?
your buddy made it out last night. the place went apeshit.
really?  how come he did not take me?
maybe because you are shot in the leg.
oh, yeah.  listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?
he is giving them a run for their money.  says here they have got two hueys from danang.  i did not know those dinks had hueys.
half their air force is our stuff. captured.
typical...
sir, there is something else... a transat relay.  just came through.
what?
christ.  how did you get here?
took bus, most of way.  i knew you would come here.
and how did you sneak up like that?
carefully.  do not want to get shot by you.  bad karma.  anyway, you need me.
i do?
you think you are... .
invulnerable.
in-vul-nerabo.  but you get ass kicked without me.
you try get across laos?  get to thailand?
yeah.  got some business there. what are you gonna do?
go united states.  see nguyen. maybe teach economics.  buy cadillac.  watch "dynasty."
how you going to get there?  you can not trust the spooks to pull you out.  they will use you up and throw you away.
i know.  i go with you.
i could not get you in.
yes you can.
how?
look, co...
why you do not feel love?  not allowed?  dead inside, maybe?  you make yourself dead already so they can not kill you?  in-vulnerabo?  bullshit!
what was that?
minigun.  come on.  let's move. he is coming in on our open side.
john.  my name is john.
it does not hurt.  why does not it hurt?
um... actually, no.  it looks like he shot down one of their gunships...
christ almighty.
... and then he, uh... took the other one.
what?
he... took it.
gawd, you look awful.
you comin'?
hold your pantyhose.  here, gimme a hand.
can you handle the door gun?
duck soup.
brewer!  you know what that thing's packing?
it is a soviet mil mi-24.  probably has 12.7mm nose cannon, heat-seeking rockets and wire guided missiles, plus...
forget it.
hell.  this is just like fucking star wars, man!
star wars?
you are going to love it.
how much we got left in that minigun?
... and there is this guy with a black helmet and cape, right, and he is got this sword... except it is not a sword, it is light...
there is the mekong.
