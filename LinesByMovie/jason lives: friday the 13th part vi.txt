now you better cool out a minute, boy.  you already almost got your head blown to pieces.
will you listen, dammit!
don't piss me off, junior.  or i will repaint this office with your brains.
jason is alive.  we dug up his body.  i was gonna cremate it and...
hold it.  whoa... what's your name, son?
tommy jarvis.  we gotta do something.  he's even more powerful now that...
aren't you the kid whose mother and friends were....
yeah.  jason murdered them and...
and you've been at some psychiatric clinic ever since, haven't you?
yes, but they released me because...
no problem, rick.  come over and meet a former resident here, tommy jarvis.  he's got some kinda prank going about...
there's no time for this bullshit...
why didn't you cremate him?!
they were gonna!  but some asshole sent a lot of money to give jason and his mother a decent burial. now look, you just lie down and get some rest.  in the morning i'll call that clinic and see if they...
if you'd just go to the cemetery, you'll see i'm not lying.
either you go to sleep or i'll come in there and put you out.
you're gonna be sorry you didn't listen to me.
you're gonna be sorry if you don't shut the fuck up.
will you slow down?  it's hard enough to read this thing.
well, who told me to take this cow path?
you admit the sign did say "camp forest green," with an arrow pointing this way.
i admit nothing without talking to my lawyer.
darren, we better turn around.
why?
why?  because i've seen enough horror movies to know masked weirdos are never friendly.
yeah... we're gonna scare him.
we're gonna scare him?!
that's right.  just drive toward him.  he'll move.  nobody wants to die.
that's a freakin' fact.  least of all us.
just drive.  he'll get out of our way.
oh, jeez.
that's it.  we're driving this baby back to town... in reverse.
don't worry about it.  just stay cool.
stay cool?  you ain't dirty harry. now stop it.
come on, dad.  you could have rick drive down cunningham road and look for them.
megan, my deputies have more important things to do than look for camp counselors with car trouble.
it's just that darren and lizbeth are in charge of organizing and setting up the new campgrounds.
all the little kids arrive today. we're not ready to deal with that alone.
i sympathize with you kids.  the best i can do is call the station in carpenter and have them keep a lookout for them.
i got a bad feeling of what might've happened to them.
jason who?
megan, get away from him.  he's dangerous.
yes!
no!...  ... you kids better leave.  this boy here is not well and i need to talk to him in private.
but, dad, we...
megan, take your friends back to the camp.  i'll let you know if i hear anything about your counselors.
i was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  but i don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
but they have to be warned, sheriff.  jason will return to the area that's familiar.  no matter what you call it, it's still camp crystal lake to him.
once we nail roy, that's it. victory is ours.
this is taking forever.  i'm starving.
that's your problem, larry. that's why your sales are always below quota.  your instinct to eat is stronger than your instinct to win.
my ass.
yeah, that's fat too.
you become a whole other person when you're out here, stan.  and i don't like it.
this is a man's game.  requiring a man's cunning and intelligence...
....with a woman's touch.
now wait a second!  i thought burt shot you.
see any paint?...  ...sorry, guys, i did in mr. commando.  survival is the name of the game, and that flag is mine.
never should've let her play.
it's a damn company executive game, and she's a damn company exec.
it's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
he really believes jason's still alive, doesn't he?
but that's no what worries me the most...it's how far he'll go to try and prove it.
come on, you guys!  the game's over!!
you don't know for sure.  what about roy?  nobody's seen him.
of course not.  if he hasn't already accidentally pelleted himself, i'm sure he's lost.
yeah, but the game's not over until it's over.
ahh, nothing.
i could swear i heard...
i'm getting real tired of this maniac.
maybe we better call that psychiatric clinic.
better call an ambulance first.
i gotta show you jason's grave.
i've seen it.
please, sheriff.  you'll see we dug it up.
don't concern yourself, martin. this boy needs treatment.  we're taking care of it.  sorry for the disturbance.
jason's not in his coffin!  hawes is!  dig it up!  you gotta dig it up!!
so where's cort gone off to?
are you ready?  he's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
which is?
boy scouting.
you gotta be kidding!
okay, okay.  i suggest that the crime was committed in the bedroom, by colonel mustard, with the knife.
huh?  oh, come on, sis.  i'm tellin' ya, we can't play clue with just two people.
why not?  i used to play it alone. i love murder games.  have you ever played the consulting detective?
no...did megan say when she's coming back from her...visit?
of course not.  she probably took him a loaf of bread with a saw hidden in it.  i still don't get it.  why him?  i mean, he's cute alright, but...
hi.  everything's all right now. we're here.
yeah, we're here.
so what happened?
there was this monster.  he was after me.  he wanted to kill me.
you mean you had a bad dream.
no, he was real.  like on tv.
okay, listen...what's your name, sweetie?
nancy.
well, nancy, i'm paula... remember?  this is sissy, and we're gonna be right out there all night so nothing can hurt you. okay?...
...good.  so no more bad dreams can come around here, huh?
no more.
i just realized something. where's cort?  i haven't seen him for hours.
i don't know.  he called somebody, then took off.
he didn't say anything?
yeah, he was gonna check out "things that go bump in the night."
i thought that was the end of the song.
great.  just great.
if this thing is burned out, friggin' horace will ground my butt.
who's horace?
my friggin' stepfather and asshole- in-residence.
what?
go out and plug the cord back in.
what?  who pulled it out?!
will you hurry up!  i gotta get this fuckmobile back before horace finds out i took it.
alright, alright.
that's it.  pull over.  i'm drivin'.
no way...  ...i wanna rock!
when are you going to stop treating me like one!
when you stop acting like one... tommy jarvis is a very sick boy. and you...
how do you know?  did you take his temperature?
you watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
what it is?
not what...who.  seems your boyfriend wants people to believe jason has returned.
i thought jason was only a legend?
he is.  only tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...you stay put.  and i'm not kidding.
yeah, hi.  listen, i've got to talk to your dad.  about jason. i've got a plan.  i need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  if he finds you, he'll...
i already have a very good idea what could've happened...  ...megan, jason is out there.  he has to be stopped.  i'm positive he's heading back to the lake area.  he'll keep killing until...
is that all you found?
i wish it was.
better get out the hefty bags... looks like our boy desperately wants us to believe his story.
he sure chose the right day to pull this shit.
whaddya mean?
happy friday the 13th.
what's goin' on?
i think somebody's messin' around out there.
what?
hide it behind the gas station. then we can get the hell out of here.
didn't you say you needed some supplies to do this?
uh...yes.  but...
then let's get goin'.  we can argue on the way.  you tell me what you need...  ...i'll make sure you get in.
you got it.  just keep an eye out for roadblocks.
okay.  there's one.
with extreme car, for god's sake. if that kid is with her, there's every good chance he'll do something crazy.
please don't do anything crazy.
it's all over.
it's just beginning.
where'd you get this?
i found it outside.
you know what?  sissy and cort are playing jokes.  you know, trying to scare each other.
why?
well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
are they grown-ups?
that's debatable.
huh?
i can't believe no one called back.  i better...
who ya calling?
but what if they try and scare us?
we'll scare 'em right back.
...and i said, shut up!
all he's asking is for you to check it out.
you got me where you want me. there's no reason not...
if i had you where i really wanted you, they'd be pumping your ass full of formaldehyde.
can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
we have!  trying to track you down.  the phone there is disconnected.
doesn't that tell you something?!
yeah...they should've paid their bill.
you just sit tight, jason.  once the authorities from carpenter get here, you'll...
sheriff, you better take this.
rick.  keep and eye on our wacko kid.  i'll be back as soon as i can.
daddy, what is going on?
and make sure my daughter stays put...  ...she's grounded.
no.  no, it's not...
yes, megan.  tommy jarvis is a killer.  a very deranged boy who wants you to believe that...
i'm sure cort and sissy are back in their cabins.  so you just go back to sleep and don't worry.
but what i get scared again?
shhh...you know what i used to do when i was a little girl when i got scared?
so what are ya drawin'?
what's it to ya?
there...ya happy?
no.
why?
'cause it stinks.
okay, give it back.
come and get it.
sorry, megan.  not this time.
wait a minute. i just...
i thank you for getting me out. but i gotta finish what i started.
are you sure this is gonna work? i mean, why didn't we bring that gun and just blast him away?
it probably wouldn't have any effect on him.  the only sure way to stop jason is to return him to his original resting place, where he drowned in 1957.
lake forest green?
crystal lake...where the nightmare began.
they did show up.  isn't that great?
i hope so.
whew...okay, hand me those padlocks.
did you hear me?!
yes.  and i said, hand me those padlocks.
