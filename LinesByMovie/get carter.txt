bollock naked with his socks still on?
they do that up north.
what for? protective purposes?
ask me?
ask jack. it's his old stamping ground.
not suede boots!
knock it off, gerald.
what? and get the clap?
i won't be using the room tonight.
i see.
i'm staying with a friend.
her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
it's not like that, luv.
it never is.
are you a traveller?
definitely.
will this do?
very nice.  i'll pay you for tonight as well.
don't be bloody silly. you're the first since monday.
you sure?
ta.
i'll bet this one's seen some action.
sorry about your father.
yeah.
tell me, doreen, did the police say anything?
they said he was drunk.
how's school?
i left last year.
oh, what you doing now?
working at woolworths.
that must be interesting.
yes.
we weren't sure where it was taking place, like.
nice of you to come.
no. frank was a good bloke.
i couldn't believe it when i heard. carter is suddenly attentive.
what?
i mean, i was surprised when he didn't turn up for work.  he was always on time.
did you work with him, keith?
at the half moon.
it's a bloody funny thing. you know a bloke for six bloody years and all the time he's as calm as gentle jesus...  ...then he goes and does a thing like that.  it's a bloody funny thing.
yeah. a bloody funny thing!
everyhing go off all right?
fine...  i want to talk to you.
what about?
doreen.
she's nothing to do with me.
what do you mean? you've been frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. you're closer to her than anyone.
no. no. it's not like that. i've got a husband, you know.
hold it!   hold it!  who killed frank, margaret?
killed?  i don't know anything about it.
really.
i must go. i'm in a hurry.
i want to talk to you later.
i can't.
tomorrow morning, then?
i mean, what for?
that's what i was wondering.
come off it. frank was... well... straight. he had no worries i know. hell, we worked together every day for a year. it would have showed.
why would it?
it just would. he was always the same.
since when did he drink whisky?
don't know.
nobody seems to know.
let her go. she'll be ok.  sorry about that.
don't worry. she's bound to be upset.
have another?
no. i'll be off now. i should be at work.
look, look.  get your suit cleaned.
no. it's all right.
thanks for coming.
frank was a good bloke. it's the least i could have done.
you work here, keith?
yes.
keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. right?
right.
i'm at the las vegas. behind the dance hall.  do you know a man called albert swift?
yeah. he comes in here a bit.
where would i find him?
today? at the races. he always goes.
how'd you know albert?
went to school with him.  he was leader of our gang. he'll know what's going on in this town.
is he?
jack carter.
eric. eric paice.
what you doing around here then?
didn't you know this is my home town?
no, i didn't know that.
funny, that.
thanks. so what're you doing? on your holidays?
no. i'm visiting relatives.
oh, that's nice.
it would be. if they were still living.
meaning what?
a bereavement. a death in the family.
oh, i'm sorry to hear that.
that's all right, eric.
well, well. small world, isn't it?
very...  so, who you working for these days eric?
oh, i'm straight.  respectable.
what are you doing? advertising martini?
oh, you've been watching television.
yeah,  come off it, eric. who is it?
what's it to you anyway?
i've always ad your welfare at heart, eric. besides which, i'm nosy.
that's not always a healthy way to be...
and you should know, if i remember rightly.
so you're doing all right then, eric. you're making good.
making a living.
good prospects for advancement, is there? a pension?  do you know, i'd almost forgotten what your eyes looked like.
they're still the same. piss holes in the snow.
still got a sense of humour?
yes, i retained that, eric.  do you know a man called albert swift, eric?
can't say i do.
yes, i can see your problem, mr kinnear.
sit down, jack,  i could weep. i really could. sometimes i think i'll retire. just piss off to the bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  glenda, get jack a drink. what is it, jack?
scotch, please.
piss off, ray.
eric told me of your bereavement.
yep.
do you know, i never knew he worked in one of my places!
no? funny that. neither did i.
if i'd known, i'd have fixed him up with something better.
yeah.
nasty way to go.
yes.
are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
harry! jack, i don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. glenda, you don't offer a man like jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  give him the bloody bottle.  now, where are we?
oh... i think i'll stay as i am.
you're bluffing, you bastard!
that's what you pay to find out. right, jack?
you know sid fletcher?
what?
you know sid fletcher?
i work for him.
do you?
yes, i do.

that's six hundred pounds, harry. two hundred to follow you, and i've raised it four hundred.
four hundred?
that's right.
you're not seeing me?
no.
i'll see you, then.
calling my bluff, are you, harry?
we went about together.
really?
yes, while he was here.
while he was here. you went about together?
he was here for four days.

could you do me a favour?
yeah, i'll do you a favour.

i have to. things to see to.
of course, of course. well, any time, just drop by.
yeah, i'll do that.  told you it wouldn't take long, didn't i?
jack! i didn't like that.
you should have told me who you were working for.
cyril didn't like it, either.
oh, cyril, eh? so it's all girls together, is it?
he's thinking sid and gerald won't like it much when they hear you've been sticking your nose in.
what do you want?
what happened to this car?
what's it got to do with you?
this is my brother's car.
oh ay?

train goes at four minutes past twelve. you've just got time.
that's very kind of somebody. who do i have to thank?  what happens if i miss the train?
i've been asked to make sure you don't.
oh, really. you're getting very optimistic in your old age, aren't you, thorpey?
what the bloody hell do you think you're at?
i'm sorry.
you don't look it.
no. really, i am.
don't come that bloody flannel with me. if you're a traveller, i'm bloody twiggy.  and who's he?
inside? why should i give house- room to your sort?

yeah.
ten to one, it belonged to cliff brumby, and like as not the bloody arcade as well. right along the coast. isn't that right, thorpey?
where's he living these days?
he's got a new place at burnham.

you must be joking,  keep him away from the telephone. i'm going out for a bit.
now just a minute...
ta-ra.
you know what the bloody time is!  it's two o'clock in the bloody morning!
i know.
well?
i made a mistake.
what?
i made a mistake.
what about?
never mind.
bloody well tell me who sent you.
you're a big man, but you're in bad shape. with me, it's a full- time job. now behave yourself.
you sod.
they came back?
no.
what'll they do to him?
don't ask me.
they bloody hurt me.
you're lucky. they kill as well.
and what about you? did you kill brumby?
thorpey nearly died laughing.
that little shit!
what about keith?
what about keith?
what you going to do?
pension him off.
you're a bastard.
what am i supposed to do?  i don't know where they've taken him. do you?
so shut up.
what's that gun doing in your room? suppose i phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
you wouldn't.
how'd you know i wouldn't?
'cos i know you wear purple underwear.
what's that supposed to mean?
think about it.
are you awake?
no.
do you want breakfast?
you must be joking. i never eat breakfast,  did you sleep well?
uh-huh.
did you sleep well?
yes, thank you.
are you tired?
no. are you tired?
no. i'm not tired,  do you eat breakfast?
gerald phoned us in the middle of the night, said he'd heard you've been making a nuisance of yourself.
we've got to take you back to london.
he said it'd be doing him a big favour.
we know why you're all steamed up, and so do gerald and sid.
but they have to be diplomatic.
put it away, jack. you know you won't use it.
the gun he means.
do us a favour?
what, and get myself beaten up again?
no chance of that.
not much.
they're friends of mine.
and that'll make me feel better?
i don't want to get rough, do i?
what you going to do?
i'm going to sit in the car and whistle 'rule, britannia'.
you coming back?
how could i stay away?
what happened to you, then?
how'd you find me?
did they give you a rough time?
no.  you bastard. you knew they'd come back.
no, i didn't,  does albert swift still live over the ferry?
get knotted.
all right. all right. i want to square things with you first.
oh yes? how?
stuff it! my girl friend's coming from liverpool tonight.  nice surprise, isn't it?
i'm sorry. here. this'll pay for a course in karate.
how were things between you and frank?
he was all right to me.
nothing more? just another feller?
nicer than most.
but he was just another feller, wasn't he?
yes.
though nicer than most?
yes. i can't help the way i am.
why'd you see him so regular?
once a week?
i call that regular.
he was gentlemanly. i like that.
once a week you like a gentleman?
look, i'm me, right. you're not. we are what we are, like it or not.  why all the bloody needle?
what was bugging frank?
he wanted me to leave dave and marry him. last friday i told him it wouldn't work. dave would have killed us both!  he followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street,  i had to tell frank i couldn't see him any more. it was getting too dodgy. that was on sunday.  he said he'd kill himself. i was frightened what you might do.
i don't believe you, margaret. frank wasn't like that.  i'm the villain in the family, remember?
it's the truth.
it is. honestly.
you bloody whore. frank was too careful to die like that. who killed him?
i don't know nothing.
you didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
no. i didn't know that.
a fairy godmother, all of your own. aren't you lucky?
so where are we going, princess?
to the demon king's castle, of course.
of course. where else?
how'd you know where i'd be?
you were seen parking your car. the demon king waves his wand and i was dispatched to bring you to him. lucky for you i waited.
very lucky, i should think. you're drunk!
nasty.
he must have been pretty sure i'd come.
oh, he was. he told me a magic spell that would make you come.
and what was that?
we're there now.
a new venture of mine. it's going to be a restaurant.  do you like it?
yes.
last night, after you'd gone, i did a little bit of asking around. seeing as you weren't very forthcoming,  it seems that you are concerned about the death of your brother?  i got to thinking it would be nice if the bloke you were after was the same bloke i wanted off my back,  you know my life. machines. the arcades. nice business. looks after itself. people put money in. i take it out. not much rough stuff. it's a business that makes me very happy. but recently, i've had a spot of bother,  one of my lads gets a bit over- anxious and flogs some machines in a club that's already got some. the upshot is i've had to eat shit and stop flogging my machines to other clubs.  so far as i'm concerned, that's it. apparently not. these people i've offended get the idea that it would be good to take over my whole outfit,  so i'm worried. i can't fight them — i haven't that kind of set-up. but i've got to fix them before they fix me. trouble is, if i try and they find out, i'm dead.
five grand. it belongs to you. along with a little name i'm going to give you.
what name?
kinnear. cyril kinnear.  kinnear did it.
why?
i don't know. all i know is that people were shitting bricks up at his place last saturday. your brother's name was mentioned. next day, he was dead.
why?
i don't know. that's all i was told.
that's not good enough.
christ, what...
do me a favour. you don't really expect me to fix kinnear on your say-so?  just because they tried to get me on you last night, don't think you can pull the same trick. stroll on.
jack, you're wrong.
good afternoon, mr brumby. carter exits.
jack...
who's setting you up in this place?
brumby.
is he coming here?
don't worry. he's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
aren't you scared kinnear will find out?
he won't. he thinks i'm simple.
what does he want that bloody great country place for?
entertaining.
what kind of entertaining?
now you're asking.
does brumby get a kick out of that crap?
especially when i play the lead.
that's why you waited for me.
not entirely. no.
you sure about that?
sure i'm sure.
i want to give you an oscar.
you've been watching the film.
tell me about the girl.
what girl?
the young girl. who pulled her?
i don't know.
was it albert?
shouldn't think so.
is it one of kinnear's films?
yeah.
who set it up?  eric?
yeah.
then he must have pulled her.
expect so.
did my brother frank find out?
your brother? what you talking about?
now tell me the truth.
the girl's name was doreen. that's all i know.
and you didn't know her last name?
no.
well, it's carter. that's my name,  and her father was my brother. and he was murdered last sunday. now get up and get dressed.
hello, jack,  i don't know anything, jack.
yes, you do, albert. talk or i'll kill you.
i know. i know.
you can't get away from me, albert.
i know.
i didn't know who doreen was. thought she was just another bird.
did eric pake pull her?
yes.
how?
i dunno. he's got his ways. he knows margaret.
when did you find out?
a couple of weeks back.
how?
no choice. i had a visit from somebody.
who?
cliff brumby. he'd seen the film. he wanted to meet doreen.
and you told brumby?
do you want to be dead, albert?
last sunday afternoon, eric and two of his boys arrive with frank and tell me that he's rumbled. somehow, he's seen the film and was about to shoot his mouth off. they ask me for some whisky and start forcing it down his throat.  i thought they'd just duff him up a bit. honest.
what did you do?  albert?
nothing. what could i do?
did eric know that frank was my brother?
yes. i told him.
what did he say?
'good.'
you knew what i'd do.
yes, but listen. christ, i didn't kill him.
gerald wants to see him first.
shut up.
you're finished, jack. you know that, don't you? i've bloody finished you.
not till i'm dead, eric.
you shouldn't have shown the film to frank.
i had to. it was the only way i could get at them.
you couldn't win an egg and spoon race, eric.
sod off.
eh? have a drink.
still got your sense of humour.
