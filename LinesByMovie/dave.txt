i wish i had better news... our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year.  the `cares about people like me' numbers are really in the toilet.  we're off twenty points from march and that was right after we raised interest rates...
dammit...  i told them no mayo.  see - - i could veto this simpson garner thing, but i really don't want to do that...
the monroe?
uh, yes, sir.  the monroe hotel...
did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
we're working on it.
try to find someone who looks like me this time.  that last guy was a joke.
we're doing our best, sir.
so you want to go swimming?
dave -- i'm working.
oh yeah... me, too.  you want to get dinner later?
i was gonna do something with joan.
oh. okay.  i'll catch ya tomorrow then.
oh my god...  i thought it was a legitimate deduction, i swear to god. see... i need a piano for my work sometimes...
mr. kovic.   we're not here about your taxes.
you're not?
no.
your government needs your help.
what?
on occasion for security purposes, to double for the president at the secret service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.
really?
we'd like to hire you.
really?
you understand what you'll be doing?
yeah... you just want me to wave, right?
wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
`cause you know i can do other stuff. i mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
don't say a .
right.
uh --mr. alexander?
what?
is this dangerous or anything?
no more than the usual.
the usual...
we're all set,  sir.
what about the intro?
it'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
it better be.   last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
who's this priest i'm thanking?
father mclntire.   he blessed you at the inauguration.
oh yeah.  did you take care of later on?
all set.
fabulous.
they say it hit both sides of his brain... even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
i can't believe he'd do this.
i know.
where's the girl?
she's a little hysterical right now. we've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
nightmare...
look... at some point we're going to have to call the vice president...
don't call the vice president!
... what?
just don't call him, alan!
the guy's in a coma, bob.
i don't give a shit.
bob...
this is mine, al -- all mine ... i made him. i built him.  and no cocksucker is gonna come in here and take it away from me just because he to be vice president of the united states!
till what?
tilt we figure something out.
bob, the guy had a stroke!
look, everything can be handled.  we'll just find a way to handle it.
like how?
well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
mild stroke?
yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
up and around?  soon?
soon.
you sure?  a coke or a perrier or something?
oh yeah... 1'm fine...
now, dave, something has come up and i think we need to talk about it...
look, i'm sorry.  i know you said not to talk, but when i saw the crowd i just got excited...
we're not upset with you, dave.  we think you did a terrific job.  don't we?
in fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.
extend things?
extend them.  c'mere for a second.
oh my god...
i know...  i know...  it's difficult for all of us.  but sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gqod of the country.
what happened?
well, it's...  it's sort of an... an `incident'  really...
a condition...
exactly. a condition.
it's actually kind of serious, dave. i'm afraid the president's not in very good shape.
oh my gosh...
will he be alright?
oh, yeah... probably...
we think so.
yes.
no.
i'm afraid so.
really?   crazy?
how much do you usually get paid?
uh -- i don't know.   sometimes it's just like a barter thing...  is this legal?
you know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
i'm not sure... i might have.
well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  you'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
well... i gues i would... yeah.
now,  let's say the whole country. was in that car.   the entire united states of america.
in the car?
in the car.
i see what you mean.
first lady...
don't worry.  you won't even see her.
they barely talk anymore.
you're kidding?
it happens.  this is where you'll be sleeping.
holy cow.
we'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, duane will be right outside the door.
oh... okay.
do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
it's simple, alan.  we send the vice- president to africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `president' to nominate a new one.  the whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
you mean we get `dave' to nominate you as vice president.
i was a senator, you know.
oh, i know. and then when our poor president gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed v.p. becomes the pres...
what about containment, alan?
i got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. the older one wanted head of the cdc.
is that everybody?
duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
what about her.
her?... oh -- the first lady...  she was giving that commencement speech up in bryn mawr.  i managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
and...
i told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' she seems to hate him more than ever.
fine.
everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
i just hope this yutz can pull it off.
now, remember -- keep it simple.
don't worry.
what's with her?
don't worry about it.
okay, let's go over it again. you met a girl, you fell in love...
and we're going away for a holiday.
for a month.
a month.
right and don't embellish.
i promise.  i won't.
first thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms.  alan has put together sort of a training program
great.
now some of this may feel a bit strange at first.  you gotta remember that even a professional politician has some trouble getting used to...
a teleprompter.
what?
the teleprompter.  is it hooked up?
i don't think so.
oh.
presence.
right.  now whenever he stands at a podium, the president always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
at a press conference.
what?
that's at a press conference. otherwise he just puts `em right out there.
i'm not certain about...
oh, sure.  remember the convention speech?
thanks, i wrote it.
... somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
dave...
'america isn't in what we say here tonight -- it's in the faces and the smiles of a sunday afternoon...'  hand on the heart...
dave...
it's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  hands to the side...
dave!
'... it's in the gentle kindness of the family kitchen as we gather together when the sun goes down...'
i thought you said i wasn't going to see her.
it's just five minutes.  she comes in. you wave to the press. she leaves.
yeah, but the first lady... couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
she hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
be a professional. if you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
... alright.
now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony.  all you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, ellen.'
`thanks for doing this, ellen.'
what are you staring at?
uh...
thanks for doing this, ellen.
go tuck yourself, bill.
fine.
fine.
you bet.
i'm outta here.
don't you have anything to say to me?
thanks for doing this, ellen?
you don't change, do you, bill?
so, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the first lady?
i can't say.
you mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
i can't say.
oh.
so you just protect the president the whole time?   that's your whole job?
yeah.
you got a gun?
of course.
you ever use it?
no.
huh.  you know what i always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the president.
what about it?
well, is that really true? i mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
certainly.
clean.
what do you mean, he's clean?
i mean i've checked everything. women.  liquor... finances.  i went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.
no one gets to be vice president by being that clean.
the guy's a boy scout, bob.  he declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return.
what about the wife?
clean.
check his kids.
clean.
nobody's got clean kids.
we've got nothing, bob.  this won't work.
if we find nothing, we get creative. just make something up.  instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months.  the whole thing is under control.
you think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
mr. president...
i mean,  if it's a problem...
okay, let's see... you can have him on tuesday the 25th...
are you out of your mind?
uh, let me get back to you...
you scheduled a whole day with the first lady?
it's a homeless shelter.
oh.  excuse me.
it's gonna be great.  'caring about his wife.'  'spending time on her favorite issue...'
i don't want him caring about his wife! what about the vice president!
remember that first liberty stuff we almost got nailed on?
when does it break?
couple of days.  anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
alan, we still have to control this guy...
and look at this.  russell came around on the trade bill.
you're kidding.
how long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
three years.
i'm telling you, bob,  it's a gift. when you got a ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
what?
since when do you care about the homeless?
i care about the homeless.
yeah.  i'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
gimme a quarter.
what?
quick.  gimme a quarter.
... how could i what?
oh, come on, bill.  don't patronize me.   i'm not one of your little...  turn around.  i'm talking to you!... turnaround!
... you know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  i can handle it.   but don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.
i don't understand.
that's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... when i think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
what's wrong with a magic trick?
you made their funding disappear!
look.  if there was some mistake...
there's no mistake, bill.   if you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. if you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
call bob and reed.  tell them i need them immediately.
but it's ten-thirty at night.
what the hell is this?
what the hell is this ?
the washington post.
no...
president vetoes works bill?
we vetoed that?
no!...  we didn't anything...
dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
that shelter was in this bill.
alan
lots of shelters were in this bill.
) listen, you little...
dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  even i don't understand it sometimes.  now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
but we went there.  we saw those kids.
i'm serious, dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
it's fine.
they could put you in jail.
why would they do that.  they hired me.
i don't think so
this is undeclared income.
and who's gonna find out?
the government
i am the government.
i gotta tell ya, dave.  i've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  who does these books?
i'm not sure.
i gotta tell ya, dave.  i've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  who does these books?
i'm not sure.
i just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
i'm not surprised.  can we save anywhere?
well, yeah.  but you gotta start making some choices.
choices?
you know -- priorities.  remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
you could buy it on payments.
yeah.  that's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
so what do we do?
well, there's lots of places where i think you can save, but i'm not the one who's ....... i mean, i'm not the one who's not the pres...
it's alright.  i know what you mean. let's start at the top.
what's with the cameras?
hundredth cabinet meeting.  i thought it was a nice touch.
oh.  fine.
do we have anything on the budget today?
i don't think so.
uh, mr. president... i don't believe that's on your agenda today.
well it's a last minute change.
.. nothing.
great.
choices???
yes, bob.   choices... now the commerce department..,
yes, mr. president?
you're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'boost consumer confidence in the american auto industry.'
and it's proving quite effective...
does it make the cars any better?
no,  sir.  it's more of a perceptual issue.
perceptual?
yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
why?
well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
so we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
yes, but i wouldn't...
well i'm sure that's really important, but i don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  do you want to tell him that?
what are you gonna do?
i'm going to kill him.
you can't kill a president.
he's not a president! he's an ordinary person.  i can kill an ordinary person.
bob...
i can kill a hundred ordinary people.
he's only doing what you told him to.
what i told him to?
i heard you.  you said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
well, i didn't mean it, alan. why the fuck would i want to save a homeless shelter?
he was only doing his job.
it's not his job -- it's my job!
bob...
was he a senator? is he on the trilateral commission? was he in who's who in washington nine years reed wrestles him away from the door, as bob struggles to get free.  i'll destroy him, alan. i'll shred the bastard!!!
don't do this.
i'll lock him away for good.
then we'll all go to jail together.
what do you mean by that?
just what you think i mean.
are you threatening me?
sort of... yeah.
thanks. you did great.  maybe later you could come back and we could go to camp david or something.
that'd be great.
well -- take care.
i was waiting for that jack.
i had a feeling.
you mean with you and everything?
`bleed for your king.'
what's that?
first thing they teach you at the academy.  `don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my king.'
you're kidding.
no... they don't kid.
but bill was your king, not bob.
yeah, but bob found me when i was stuck in firearms and tobacco...
didn't mean to bum you out.
that's okay.  you alright down here by yourself?
oh, sure.  don't worry about it.
... . ellen.
i saw the light.  i thought maybe you were up.
oh... yeah.
mind if i sit down?
no.
that was quite a thing you did today.
anybody would have done it.
oh, i don't think so.  still, you helped a lot of people.
kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
oh yeah?  me, too.
you weren't in the state legislature.
i mean, what is it?  another secretary? a jaunt to the bahamas with some 'campaign worker.'  where is he?
i don't know.
when were you all planning to tell me? a year from now?   after the election...  what's going on here? dave hesitates.
they asked me to help.
i'm sure they did.  'state of emergency.'  'national security.' you ever hear of the constitution?
you're leaving?
i'm not the first lady, anymore.  i shouldn't be here.
where are you going?
home.
where's home?
oh, they didn't brief you on that? how sloppy of them.
just souvenirs.  towels and stuff.
you1re leaving, too?
i never wanted to hurt anybody.  in fact... i even thought i was helping.
how were you gonna get home?
i don't know.  i hadn't thought it out that far.
you sure this goes somewhere?
truman used it all the time.
you don't have to keep walking with me.   i'm okay from here.
i don't mind.
thanks.
he said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
oh... okay.
what?
it's just so strange...
i lock at you and i see bill...  i mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... i mean, you're right here... alive and...
i'm not bill mitchell.
in fact,  i'm not anything like him and... i guess i want you to know that.
he wasn't always like that, anyway.
are you hungry?
what?
i'm starving.   there's got to be something open around here.
i really don't have much of an appetite.
just wait.
that's a secret.
you have a lot of secrets.
i guess.
so what do you do the rest of the time?
you mean when i'm not running the country?
yes.
i run a temp agency.
you know, secretaries and stiff.
you find people jobs?
yeah.  is that funny?
it's just more than anybody else does around here.
well don't get carried away -- i'm not that good at it.
you know, dave -- it is dave, isn't it?  i can't keep all of this a secret.
i know.
but you could go to jail for it.
what do you think you're doing?!
you mean the press conference?  i have a couple of ideas i wanted to share with the country.
share...
you're nothing.  do you understand me! you're nobody...
i'm... not... nobody...
you're lint!  you're a flea!  you're a blip!
well, maybe i am.  but you're fired.
... what?
i said you're fired.  go on -- get outta here.
oh... i'm fired?
yeah.
you're fired.
fine...
fine?
fine.
it was okay?
it was inspirational.
let's call it a night.   i can't take any more.
right.  we can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
well i guess...
yeah... bedtime.
what?
i can't.
i know. i'm sorry...
i mean, i want to... i just, i feel strange...
that's okay.
who?
the vice-president...
oh... right...  you know, ever since the stroke...
this is from the people of burundi...
oh... thanks.
and these are a gift from the king of to go.
what are they?
fertility beads.
ah.
mr. president, may i speak frankly with you?
certainly.
something like what...
oh, come on, we're not children.  i didn't have anything to do with this fidelity nonsense and you know it.
the fidelity nonsense...
all i've got is my integrity.  that's all i have.  now i don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
they re not my attack dogs.
what do you mean?
i just fired bob alexander.
what do you mean you made it all up?
we had to, dave. the guy's a choir boy.
this is wrong, alan!
wrong...
alan...
oh, i know, i know... it looks awfully bad.  it's really embarrassing.  but it was bob's idea.
we've got to fix this.
absolutely.  well, that might be kind of tough. once the press starts smelling blood...
`dave'?
she knows.
uh-oh...
... but as i began to investigate, i realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
jesus...
now he's making stuff up about me.
he's not.
oh... hi.
dirty business we're in sometimes.
yeah.
he's not gonna win -- not in the end... they never do.
... sometimes they do.
yeah... sometimes they do.
you ever think back to how you started.
what?
you know.  your first campaign.
one day my wife says to me 'why don't you try running for office.  you talk about it all the time, why don't you just do it?'  so i tell my boss i have a dentist appointment and i go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break.  next thing i know, i'm a councilman.
really?
my wife was my campaign manager. we had a two thousand dollar budget.
how'd you get started?
oh... kinda the same way.
what's wrong?
looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
they're crucifying you out there.
yeah, but we got a little bit done. and if you do a little and i do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
you really believe that?
yeah.  and it's better than not believing it their faces are inches apart.
i sure fall for some weird guys.
yeah.   he's a good man.
what?
die, you pond scum!
i'm the president and as they say 'the buck stops here.'  so i take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
well...
well...
you sure you don't want a lift back home?
no thanks.  it's not that far.
i would have taken a bullet for i you, dave.
thanks, duane.
hi.
hi.
) thought i needed a little change.  you like it?
it's nice.
i saw you on t.v... at his funeral.
yeah, well... it's finally over.
i never thought i'd...
i know.
i missed...
... me, too.
so this is it?
... not exactly the oval office.
oh... i lived with a president.  it isn't any fun.
it could be fun.
yeah... it could be fun.
