i wish i had better news... our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that is down eighteen on the year.  the `cares about people like me' numbers are really in the toilet.  we are off twenty points from march and that was right after we raised interest rates...
dammit...  i told them no mayo.  see - - i could veto this simpson garner thing, but i really do not want to do that...
the monroe?
uh, yes, sir.  the monroe hotel...
did you get someone to double for me there, out front?
we are working on it.
try to find someone who looks like me this time.  that last guy was a joke.
we are doing our best, sir.
so you want to go swimming?
dave -- I am working.
oh yeah... me, too.  you want to get dinner later?
i was gonna do something with joan.
oh. okay.  I will catch ya tomorrow then.
oh my god...  i thought it was a legitimate deduction, i swear to god. see... i need a piano for my work sometimes...
mr. kovic.   we are not here about your taxes.
you are not?
no.
your government needs your help.
what?
on occasion for security purposes, to double for the president at the secret service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.
really?
we would like to hire you.
really?
you understand what you will be doing?
yeah... you just want me to wave, right?
wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
`cause you know i can do other stuff. i mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
do not say a .
right.
uh --mr. alexander?
what?
is this dangerous or anything?
no more than the usual.
the usual...
we are all set,  sir.
what about the intro?
it will be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
it better be.   last time you had me introduce a dead guy.
who is this priest I am thanking?
father mclntire.   he blessed you at the inauguration.
oh yeah.  did you take care of later on?
all set.
fabulous.
they say it hit both sides of his brain... even if he makes it he is going to be a vegetable.
i can not believe he would do this.
i know.
where is the girl?
she is a little hysterical right now. we have got her upstairs in a laundry room.
nightmare...
look... at some point we are going to have to call the vice president...
do not call the vice president!
... what?
just do not call him, alan!
the guy's in a coma, bob.
i do not give a shit.
bob...
this is mine, al -- all mine ... i made him. i built him.  and no cocksucker is gonna come in here and take it away from me just because he to be vice president of the united states!
till what?
tilt we figure something out.
bob, the guy had a stroke!
look, everything can be handled.  we will just find a way to handle it.
like how?
well, start by going on television and saying that he is had a mild stroke...
mild stroke?
yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
up and around?  soon?
soon.
you sure?  a coke or a perrier or something?
oh yeah... 1'm fine...
now, dave, something has come up and i think we need to talk about it...
look, I am sorry.  i know you said not to talk, but when i saw the crowd i just got excited...
we are not upset with you, dave.  we think you did a terrific job.  do not we?
in fact, we think you did such a good job, we would like to extend things a little bit.
extend things?
extend them.  c'mere for a second.
oh my god...
i know...  i know...  it is difficult for all of us.  but sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gqod of the country.
what happened?
well, it's...  it is sort of an... an `incident'  really...
a condition...
exactly. a condition.
it is actually kind of serious, dave. I am afraid the president's not in very good shape.
oh my gosh...
will he be alright?
oh, yeah... probably...
we think so.
yes.
no.
I am afraid so.
really?   crazy?
how much do you usually get paid?
uh -- i do not know.   sometimes it is just like a barter thing...  is this legal?
you know, on an empty road where you know it is safe and nobody's around...
I am not sure... i might have.
well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  you would do it then for sure would not you?
well... i gues i would... yeah.
now,  let's say the whole country. was in that car.   the entire united states of america.
in the car?
in the car.
i see what you mean.
first lady...
do not worry.  you will not even see her.
they barely talk anymore.
you are kidding?
it happens.  this is where you will be sleeping.
holy cow.
we will be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, duane will be right outside the door.
oh... okay.
do you know how many different kinds of laws we have broken?
it is simple, alan.  we send the vice- president to africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `president' to nominate a new one.  the whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
you mean we get `dave' to nominate you as vice president.
i was a senator, you know.
oh, i know. and then when our poor president gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed v.p. becomes the pres...
what about containment, alan?
i got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. the older one wanted head of the cdc.
is that everybody?
duane's guys, but he is got them under control.
what about her.
her?... oh -- the first lady...  she was giving that commencement speech up in bryn mawr.  i managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
and...
i told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at  `the hotel.' she seems to hate him more than ever.
fine.
everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
i just hope this yutz can pull it off.
now, remember -- keep it simple.
do not worry.
what is with her?
do not worry about it.
okay, let's go over it again. you met a girl, you fell in love...
and we are going away for a holiday.
for a month.
a month.
right and do not embellish.
i promise.  i won't.
first thing we are going to work on is the mannerisms.  alan has put together sort of a training program
great.
now some of this may feel a bit strange at first.  you gotta remember that even a professional politician has some trouble getting used to...
a teleprompter.
what?
the teleprompter.  is it hooked up?
i do not think so.
oh.
presence.
right.  now whenever he stands at a podium, the president always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
at a press conference.
what?
that is at a press conference. otherwise he just puts `em right out there.
I am not certain about...
oh, sure.  remember the convention speech?
thanks, i wrote it.
... somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
dave...
'america is not in what we say here tonight -- it is in the faces and the smiles of a sunday afternoon...'  hand on the heart...
dave...
it is in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung...  hands to the side...
dave!
'... it is in the gentle kindness of the family kitchen as we gather together when the sun goes down...'
i thought you said i was not going to see her.
it is just five minutes.  she comes in. you wave to the press. she leaves.
yeah, but the first lady... could not we start with a cousin or something?
she hardly ever sees him and it will be so fast, she will not have a chance to tell.
be a professional. if you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
... alright.
now when she comes in, we will move you right out to the balcony.  all you have to say is  `thanks for doing this, ellen.'
`thanks for doing this, ellen.'
what are you staring at?
uh...
thanks for doing this, ellen.
go tuck yourself, bill.
fine.
fine.
you bet.
I am outta here.
do not you have anything to say to me?
thanks for doing this, ellen?
you do not change, do you, bill?
so, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the first lady?
i can not say.
you mean you do not know or like -- you can not say.
i can not say.
oh.
so you just protect the president the whole time?   that is your whole job?
yeah.
you got a gun?
of course.
you ever use it?
no.
huh.  you know what i always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the president.
what about it?
well, is that really true? i mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
certainly.
clean.
what do you mean, he is clean?
i mean I have checked everything. women.  liquor... finances.  i went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.
no one gets to be vice president by being that clean.
the guy's a boy scout, bob.  he declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return.
what about the wife?
clean.
check his kids.
clean.
nobody's got clean kids.
we have got nothing, bob.  this will not work.
if we find nothing, we get creative. just make something up.  instead of a couple weeks it will be a couple of months.  the whole thing is under control.
you think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
mr. president...
i mean,  if it is a problem...
okay, let's see... you can have him on tuesday the 25th...
are you out of your mind?
uh, let me get back to you...
you scheduled a whole day with the first lady?
it is a homeless shelter.
oh.  excuse me.
it is going to be great.  'caring about his wife.'  'spending time on her favorite issue...'
i do not want him caring about his wife! what about the vice president!
remember that first liberty stuff we almost got nailed on?
when does it break?
couple of days.  anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they will burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
alan, we still have to control this guy...
and look at this.  russell came around on the trade bill.
you are kidding.
how long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
three years.
I am telling you, bob,  it is a gift. when you got a ferrari you do not leave it in the garage.
what?
since when do you care about the homeless?
i care about the homeless.
yeah.  I am sure it is keeping you up nights.
gimme a quarter.
what?
quick.  gimme a quarter.
... how could i what?
oh, come on, bill.  do not patronize me.   I am not one of your little...  turn around.  I am talking to you!... turnaround!
... you know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that is fine.  i can handle it.   but do not pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.
i do not understand.
that is not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... when i think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
what is wrong with a magic trick?
you made their funding disappear!
look.  if there was some mistake...
there is no mistake, bill.   if you veto their funding, it is not a mistake. if you hurt someone intentionally, it is not a mistake.
call bob and reed.  tell them i need them immediately.
but it is ten-thirty at night.
what the hell is this?
what the hell is this ?
the washington post.
no...
president vetoes works bill?
we vetoed that?
no!...  we did not anything...
dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
that shelter was in this bill.
alan
lots of shelters were in this bill.
) listen, you little...
dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  even i do not understand it sometimes.  now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
but we went there.  we saw those kids.
I am serious, dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
it is fine.
they could put you in jail.
why would they do that.  they hired me.
i do not think so
this is undeclared income.
and who is going to find out?
the government
i am the government.
i got to tell ya, dave.  I have been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just does not add up.  who does these books?
I am not sure.
i got to tell ya, dave.  I have been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just does not add up.  who does these books?
I am not sure.
i just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
I am not surprised.  can we save anywhere?
well, yeah.  but you gotta start making some choices.
choices?
you know -- priorities.  remember when you could not get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
you could buy it on payments.
yeah.  that is how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
so what do we do?
well, there is lots of places where i think you can save, but I am not the one who is ....... i mean, I am not the one who is not the pres...
it is alright.  i know what you mean. let's start at the top.
what is with the cameras?
hundredth cabinet meeting.  i thought it was a nice touch.
oh.  fine.
do we have anything on the budget today?
i do not think so.
uh, mr. president... i do not believe that is on your agenda today.
well it is a last minute change.
.. nothing.
great.
choices???
yes, bob.   choices... now the commerce department..,
yes, mr. president?
you are spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to...  'boost consumer confidence in the american auto industry.'
and it is proving quite effective...
does it make the cars any better?
no,  sir.  it is more of a perceptual issue.
perceptual?
yes, it is designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
why?
well... to shore up product identification and preserve market share.
so we are spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they have already bought?
yes, but i wouldn't...
well I am sure that is really important, but i do not want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  do you want to tell him that?
what are you gonna do?
I am going to kill him.
you can not kill a president.
he is not a president! he is an ordinary person.  i can kill an ordinary person.
bob...
i can kill a hundred ordinary people.
he is only doing what you told him to.
what i told him to?
i heard you.  you said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
well, i did not mean it, alan. why the fuck would i want to save a homeless shelter?
he was only doing his job.
it is not his job -- it is my job!
bob...
was he a senator? is he on the trilateral commission? was he in who is who in washington nine years reed wrestles him away from the door, as bob struggles to get free.  I will destroy him, alan. I will shred the bastard!!!
do not do this.
I will lock him away for good.
then we will all go to jail together.
what do you mean by that?
just what you think i mean.
are you threatening me?
sort of... yeah.
thanks. you did great.  maybe later you could come back and we could go to camp david or something.
that would be great.
well -- take care.
i was waiting for that jack.
i had a feeling.
you mean with you and everything?
`bleed for your king.'
what is that?
first thing they teach you at the academy.  `don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my king.'
you are kidding.
no... they do not kid.
but bill was your king, not bob.
yeah, but bob found me when i was stuck in firearms and tobacco...
did not mean to bum you out.
that is okay.  you alright down here by yourself?
oh, sure.  do not worry about it.
... . ellen.
i saw the light.  i thought maybe you were up.
oh... yeah.
mind if i sit down?
no.
that was quite a thing you did today.
anybody would have done it.
oh, i do not think so.  still, you helped a lot of people.
kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
oh yeah?  me, too.
you were not in the state legislature.
i mean, what is it?  another secretary? a jaunt to the bahamas with some 'campaign worker.'  where is he?
i do not know.
when were you all planning to tell me? a year from now?   after the election...  what is going on here? dave hesitates.
they asked me to help.
I am sure they did.  'state of emergency.'  'national security.' you ever hear of the constitution?
you are leaving?
I am not the first lady, anymore.  i should not be here.
where are you going?
home.
where is home?
oh, they did not brief you on that? how sloppy of them.
just souvenirs.  towels and stuff.
you1re leaving, too?
i never wanted to hurt anybody.  in fact... i even thought i was helping.
how were you gonna get home?
i do not know.  i had not thought it out that far.
you sure this goes somewhere?
truman used it all the time.
you do not have to keep walking with me.   I am okay from here.
i do not mind.
thanks.
he said he will pick it up in a couple of days.
oh... okay.
what?
it is just so strange...
i lock at you and i see bill...  i mean, he is almost dead, but he is right here... i mean, you are right here... alive and...
I am not bill mitchell.
in fact,  I am not anything like him and... i guess i want you to know that.
he was not always like that, anyway.
are you hungry?
what?
I am starving.   there is got to be something open around here.
i really do not have much of an appetite.
just wait.
that is a secret.
you have a lot of secrets.
i guess.
so what do you do the rest of the time?
you mean when I am not running the country?
yes.
i run a temp agency.
you know, secretaries and stiff.
you find people jobs?
yeah.  is that funny?
it is just more than anybody else does around here.
well do not get carried away -- I am not that good at it.
you know, dave -- it is dave, is not it?  i can not keep all of this a secret.
i know.
but you could go to jail for it.
what do you think you are doing?!
you mean the press conference?  i have a couple of ideas i wanted to share with the country.
share...
you are nothing.  do you understand me! you are nobody...
i'm... not... nobody...
you are lint!  you are a flea!  you are a blip!
well, maybe i am.  but you are fired.
... what?
i said you are fired.  go on -- get outta here.
oh... I am fired?
yeah.
you are fired.
fine...
fine?
fine.
it was okay?
it was inspirational.
let's call it a night.   i can not take any more.
right.  we can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
well i guess...
yeah... bedtime.
what?
i can't.
i know. I am sorry...
i mean, i want to... i just, i feel strange...
that is okay.
who?
the vice-president...
oh... right...  you know, ever since the stroke...
this is from the people of burundi...
oh... thanks.
and these are a gift from the king of to go.
what are they?
fertility beads.
ah.
mr. president, may i speak frankly with you?
certainly.
something like what...
oh, come on, we are not children.  i did not have anything to do with this fidelity nonsense and you know it.
the fidelity nonsense...
all I have got is my integrity.  that is all i have.  now i do not know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
they re not my attack dogs.
what do you mean?
i just fired bob alexander.
what do you mean you made it all up?
we had to, dave. the guy's a choir boy.
this is wrong, alan!
wrong...
alan...
oh, i know, i know... it looks awfully bad.  it is really embarrassing.  but it was bob's idea.
we have got to fix this.
absolutely.  well, that might be kind of tough. once the press starts smelling blood...
`dave'?
she knows.
uh-oh...
... but as i began to investigate, i realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
jesus...
now he is making stuff up about me.
he is not.
oh... hi.
dirty business we are in sometimes.
yeah.
he is not going to win -- not in the end... they never do.
... sometimes they do.
yeah... sometimes they do.
you ever think back to how you started.
what?
you know.  your first campaign.
one day my wife says to me 'why do not you try running for office.  you talk about it all the time, why do not you just do it?'  so i tell my boss i have a dentist appointment and i go down to the registrar of voters on my lunch break.  next thing i know, I am a councilman.
really?
my wife was my campaign manager. we had a two thousand dollar budget.
how did you get started?
oh... kinda the same way.
what is wrong?
looks like we are not going to get a chance to get much done.
they are crucifying you out there.
yeah, but we got a little bit done. and if you do a little and i do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
you really believe that?
yeah.  and it is better than not believing it their faces are inches apart.
i sure fall for some weird guys.
yeah.   he is a good man.
what?
die, you pond scum!
I am the president and as they say 'the buck stops here.'  so i take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
well...
well...
you sure you do not want a lift back home?
no thanks.  it is not that far.
i would have taken a bullet for i you, dave.
thanks, duane.
hi.
hi.
) thought i needed a little change.  you like it?
it is nice.
i saw you on t.v... at his funeral.
yeah, well... it is finally over.
i never thought i'd...
i know.
i missed...
... me, too.
so this is it?
... not exactly the oval office.
oh... i lived with a president.  it is not any fun.
it could be fun.
yeah... it could be fun.
