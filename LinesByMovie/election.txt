good morning, mr. mcallister.
not wasting any time, are you, tracy?
you know what they say about the early bird.
yes, i do.
well, good luck there, tracy
thanks, mr. m.
okay.  but we are still missing something key here.  what are we missing?
i know.
tracy.
ethics are...
now at the end of her junior year, tracy was poised to win the presidency of the student body.  and so far she was running unopposed.
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
oh.  there is one more thing about tracy i think you should know.
a few months before the election, she would had an affair with my best friend dave novotny.
do not tell me that.  i do not want to know that.
she is incredible.  everything just gets soaked.
you could tell dave was one of those guys who taught because they never wanted to leave high school in the first place, and that could get a little irritating sometimes, but basically he was a real good guy.
foxy. . . foxy. . . you know you are a cute little heartbreaker... foxy... you know you are a sweet little love maker...
one night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. eventually dave and i were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
you know, tracy... i do not know how to say this, but...
what?
well, i notice you do not seem to have any close friends at millard. you seem to be kind of a loner.
no, I am not. I am just really busy.
i know.  i know its not by choice.  i just mean, well, being the kind of person you are, it must be really difficult to find someone you can talk to.
what do you mean? what kind of person am i?
what kind of person?
tracy, I have been watching you for going on two years now, and i think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- i have ever met.  i mean, you are the real thing.  special.
thank you.
and i know sometimes people like you have to pay a price for their greatness, and that price is loneliness.
it was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
here, get down.
you did it at your house?  your own house?
look, jim...  okay.  i know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger.  but now it is different.  jim, what I am trying to tell you is that tracy and i are totally, totally in love.
in love?
yeah, it is serious.  i mean she inspires me in ways sherry never has. she even wants to read my novel.
but you have not written your novel.
that is the whole point. it is all in my head; it is right here.  i just got to get it out there. tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  it is beautiful.
dave, I am just saying this as your friend.  what you are doing is really, really wrong, and you have got to stop.
you are not just jealous, are you?  i mean, we both used to talk about her
that was just talk!  fantasy talk! what are you, nuts?  we talk about girls all the time, but it does not mean anything. i would never. . . i mean, i take very seriously our strict moral code.  the line you have crossed is... it is illegal and it is immoral.
i do not need a lecture on ethics, jim, okay?  i know what --
I am not talking about ethics.  I am talking about morals.
after dave got fired, sherry kicked him out of the house and filed for divorce.
your novel? are you fucking kidding me?
sherry   sherry  sheerrry. ...
he ended up moving back to milwaukee to live with his parents. i have not heard from him in a long time. poor guy. i warned him.
i got all my signatures.  one hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than i need!
hey, that is super
here they are.
you can put those in my box.  I will look at them tomorrow.
could you approve them now?  I would like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
right
looks good to me.
are not you supposed to keep them?
no, that is fine
i thought you were supposed to keep them.
okay, fine. sure
thanks for everything.
you bet.
i can not wait to start campaigning.
should be easy.  so far no competition.
hell, you know, coca-cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. i guess that is how come they stay number one.
yeah.  okay.  well, good luck tracy
you know, mr. m., when i win the presidency, that means you and i are going to be spending a lot of time together next year.  and i for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. would not you?
sure
okay. that is good. i just wanted to make sure.
good luck, tracy.
thank god for diane.  she was my best friend, my source of love and strength. oh sure, we would had our share of bumpy times, but we would always seen them through.  after nine years of marriage, we were closer than ever.  and the secret? good communication.
anything wrong?
everything's fine.  just, you know, school.
paul, i know you have been pretty down since your accident.
i wanted to play next year so bad i could taste it.  and maybe go on to...
i know.  i understand disappointment. i really do.
yeah.
but you have got a big choice right now. you can choose to be depressed about it for the rest of your life. or you can choose to see it for what it really is: an opportunity.  i personally think you have a big future ahead of you, and i do not mean the fleeting glory of sports.
what do you mean?
let me give you a clue.  you are a born leader.  you are one of the most popular students at millard.  you are honest and straightforward.  you do not choke under pressure, as we all saw in that amazing fourth quarter against westside.  the other kids look up to you.  what does that spell?
who, me?  nooo.  i never... i do not know anything about that stuff, mr. m. besides, that is tracy flick's thing. she is always working so hard and --
yeah, no, she is a go-getter, all right.
and she is super-nice
yeah.  but one person assured of victory kind of undermines the whole idea of a democracy, does not it? that is more like a... well, like a dictatorship, like we studied.
paul, what is your favorite fruit?
huh?  oh.  uh... pears
takes a piece of chalk from the lip of the blackboard.
okay, let's say
no, wait -- apples.  apples.
fine.  let's say all you ever knew was apples.  apples, apples and more apples. you might think apples were pretty good, even if you occasionally got a rotten one. then one day there is an orange. and now you can make a decision. do you want an apple, or do you want an orange? that is democracy.
i also like bananas.
exactly.  so what do you say?  maybe it is time to give a little something back.
who put you up to this?
huh?  oh, hi, tracy
who put you up to this?
what do you mean?
you just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
no.  uh... i just... you know, i just thought --
thought what?
well, see, i was talking to mr. mcallister about my leg and everything... and how i still want to, you know, do something for the school and --
so mr. mcallister asked you to run.
well, i mean, you know, i talked to him and everything, but he just said he thought it was a good idea... and how there is all different kinds of fruit and...  it is nothing against you, tracy. you are the best.  i just thought --
okay, mr. popular.  you are on.
what?
i told you ... i can't. i just -- it does not feel right anymore, you know?
hey, tammy, guess what happened today.
do not you fucking knock?
yeah.  so guess what happened.  so mr. mcallister, he --  oh hi. lisa.
paul, get out!
so mr. m. calls me in and tells me --
you dumbshit!
what did i do?
you know how they say one day a big meteor might come and crash into the earth and kill everybody? well, i think that would be a good thing.
where 're you going?
I am not like you.
what...?
I am not a dyke, okay, and we are not in love. we were just... i was just experimenting.
are you crazy?
what?
people can see this.
so?
these are private -- these are for us.
i know.
but other people can see them too.
i do not care.
well, i do.
uhhh... teeth. teeth.
sorry.
around that time diane and i were hanging out a lot at sherry novotny's house, giving her our love and support and helping her make it through a difficult time.
jim, don't.  you are scaring him.
he likes it.
you gonna do it? you gonna do it?
yeah, uh, just a minute
come on, doit. doit. fill me up. come on, fill me up
yeah, just --
do it!
could you get this? i can not
sure.
without dave around. sherry needed a lot of help around the house.
here?
more this way.
okay.  give me the drill.
i can not afford this stuff right now.
oh, come on.  you have had a hard year, you are cooped up with the kid all the time.  let go; live a little.
you sure?
so what do you think?  should we get a room?
should we get a what?
points at the motel.
oh.
how did it go?
fine. you know. we just went to crossroads.
you guys have fun?
yeah. no. i mean, you know.
what?
well, sherry's great.  but she can be a little much sometimes.
fuck me, mr. mcallister
so like i was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.
you are the advisor.  you should stop her.  she is not qualified.  she is just a sophomore.
calm down, tracy.  just calm down.
are you sure all her signatures are real?  it is not easy to get all those signatures.
as far as i know, they--
we can not both run, can we?  we are brother and sister.  can we?
it is a conflict of interest.  and paul was first.
these are a bunch of burn-outs. and look at this one, i can not even read this one.
looks like tim kobza.
she is doing this to get back at me
for what?
i mean at you.
for what?
i do not know.  you are her brother you should know.
tim kobza?  tim kobza!  who is he? I have never heard of him!
look, why do not we just forget about tammy?  we will have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I am sure everything will be fine.
that little bitch made a fool of us i want her out of the election. getting everybody all riled up like that.  she is finished, you hear me? washed up.
walt, we can not throw her out of the election just because we do not like her speech.  that is not what student government's about.
yeah... whatever.  all i know is she is a troublemaker.  she is on my list.
what do you want?
oh.  hi, tammy.  i was just, you know, i went to all your teachers and got your assignments.
i just thought, well, last time you got suspended you fell so behind and -
okay, paul.  thanks.  thanks a lot.
now could you leave me alone?
yeah.  oh, one more thing. tammy. you know, all this election stuff. 'cause, you know, everyone is saying it is so weird that you are running against me, and, well, it is kind of weird, and you have not really told me why you are doing it and did not tell me in advance or anything.  but that is okay, you know.  l respect your privacy.  i just want you to know that no matter who wins, if it is you or me, there is no hard feelings. we are still brother and sister.  okay? cause... and i hope you feel the same.
sure, paul.  no hard feelings.
okay.  great.  i feel good.
shall we give it a name?
dave.
did you know dave's a bed wetter?
no, i... uh, did not know that
all his life.  he is tried everything.
still clear?
yep.
we will let it run awhile
hey yeah?
take me to that motel.  like you wanted.
right now?
easy, tiger.  come by after school. I will leave darryl with the sitter.
three twenty-five.
three twenty-five.
jim, where the hell have you been?
nowhere.  i do not have class until second period.
even tried you at home.  we have got a situation here.
we still have some extra ones, do not we?  maybe we can just --
it was tammy i  that is who it was.
oh, no, hey.  like i said. tammy wouldn't... she...
well, that speech she gave -- it was pretty, you know, pretty out there.  but we will get to the bottom of it.  do not you worry. mr. mcallister is going to see to that.  right, jim?
oh yeah, you bet.
i guess you know why you are here
if it is about the posters, i think it is so awful. it is a travesty.
a travesty.  huh.  that is interesting, because i think you did it.
wait - are you accusing me? you are not serious.  i can't... mr. mcallister, we have worked together on sga for three solid years and... i mean, i can not believe it. i'm... I am shocked!
mr. m., i am running on my qualifications.  i would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... plus, my own best banner was torn down.  did i do that too?
were you or were you not working in the watchdog office over the weekend?
i was.  so?  mr. pecharda let me in. as you know, with all my responsibilities i often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. but i left very early, around 6:30.
6:30.  how do you know what time the posters were torn down?
i don't.  i just know they were there when i left.  I am giving you helpful information is all.  you know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
okay, tracy, so who do you think did it?  whom should we "interrogate?"
well, i do not know.  it could have been anybody.  there are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around millard.  you know, like rick thieson and kevin speck and those burn-outs.  or doug schenken - what about him?  or what about tammy metzier?  her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that.
you are a very intelligent girl, tracy. you have many admirable qualities.  but someday maybe you will learn that being smart and always being on top and doing whatever you need to do to get ahead, and yes, stepping on people to get there, well, there is a lot more to life than that.  and in the end, you are only cheating yourself.
why are you lecturing me?
this is not the time or the place to get into it, but there is, for just one example, a certain former colleague of mine, who made a very big mistake, a life mistake.  i think the lesson there is that, old and young, we ail make mistakes, and we have to learn that our actions, all of them, can carry serious consequences.  you are very young, tracy underage, in fact -- but maybe one day you will understand.
i do not know what you are referring to, but i do know that if certain older and wiser people had not acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
i agree.  but i also think certain young and naive people need to thank their lucky stars and be very, very grateful the whole school did not find out about certain indiscretions which could have ruined their reputations, and chances to win certain elections.
and i think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" should not be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can not even get their own wives pregnant.  and they certainly should not be running around making slanderous accusations. especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. and if you want to keep questioning me like this, i will not continue without my attorney present.
you wanted to see me, mr. m.?
just wait outside. tammy.
okay.  but is this about the posters?
possibly.  please just wait outside.
okay.  because i know who did it.  so.. I will just be outside.
so... what do you have to tell me?
well, this is hard for me, but i think it is important to be honest. do not you?
what is it. tammy?
I am the one.  i did it.  i tore down paul's posters.
looks at her skeptically  does not say a word.
i did it.
and when did you do it?
this weekend.
exactly when?
i do not know. yesterday.  sunday.
and how did you get in the school?
door was open.
which door?
i do not know. all i know is i did it i
i do not believe you.
i have proof.
yes?
looks like today's your lucky day
what do you mean?
you are off the hook. tammy here has confessed.
i told you!  i told you!  you are going to pay for my banner!
that is enough, tracy.  quit while you are ahead, okay?  I will handle this.  could you ask walt to come in?
do not you smartass me!  do not you dare smartass me!  you just shut your mouth i  now your mother and i have had a long talk with halt hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. you know, he does not want you back at millard.  he is fed up with you.  fed up!  and i do not blame him!
dick... dick,..
what?
tammy,  now we have come to a decision. he just think it would be best --
you are going to catholic school next year.  you are going to sacred heart. maybe they will straighten you out!
way to go, tracy!  is not this exciting?
yeah.
hell, good luck!
good luck to you too, paul.
thanks!
what?  right.  so let's start counting.
well, i thought that... well, the way it always works is that sga president does a count, then the sga advisor, you know, for the two independent counts.
fine.  so do your count.  start with president, and I will be right back.
you have the key, mr. mcallister.
i just want to get this over with, so we can have the assembly and go home. we do not have much time until eighth period.  i have other things going on, too, you know.
okay.  yeah.  we know
all right.  I will be back
what do you want, jim?
you are there.
yeah.  I am here.
sherry... i love you.
do not say that.  you know it is not true.
it is the only true thing i know anymore.
we made a mistake.  let's not make it worse.
a mistake?  that was no mistake.
i was lonely.  you took advantage
me?  i took advantage of you?  you hugged me!  you kissed me!  you are the one who --
what d'you got?
I am not supposed to tell. not until you have counted too. we are each supposed to make an independent count.
you are kidding, right?
i thought those were the rules, mr. mcallister. if they have changed in any way --
larry, we are not electing the fucking pope here. just tell me who won.
mr. m.?
huh.  okay.  well, i guess I would better do my count.
larry?
yeah?
i think we have got a problem.
253... 254... 255. i get the same as you jim. looks like paul's our president.
no way i it does not make sense.
sorry. my figures work out exactly the same as jim's. 256 for paul, 255 for tracy.
and 290 "disregards," right?
if you say so.
mostly tammy fans
see, it does not add up. there are only 801 ballots but 803 people voted. two votes are missing. check the register.
he is right. two people must have pocketed their ballots. usually it is more.
but, they were there i counted 803 votes.
it happens, larry. people make mistakes.
i did not make a mistake. every vote was there when you sac down
whoa! easy, fouch. i do not like where you are going.
I am telling you. dr. hendricks, every vote was accounted for.
larry? we have got twenty-five minutes until the assembly, and we still have to do counts for vp, treasurer and secretary. mr. hendricks and i have both verified the numbers, and unless you can come up with the ballots you claim are missing -
but, mr. m. -
paul, i just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you have run a wonderful campaign. it is been fun competing with you.
yeah, you too, tracy.  I am just glad it is over.
yeah.
you know, i do not understand why everybody bad-mouthed tracy all the time.  she was always super- nice to me.
act surprised. walk slowly to the podium.  be modest.  thank them for this incredible honor.
that said, the whole point of an election is to choose winners, and that you have done.  we will begin with president.
having a problem with your eye there?
dick.
oh, no.  no.  I am just finishing up here, and I have got to get home.
why do not you guys go sit down, okay? I will catch up in a minute? i want to talk to mr. m. about some important stuff.
all right.  well, sure nice to meet you.
so nice
and on halloween we could have a haunted house.  but a really good haunted house, not like those cheesy bad ones.  you know, more like the radio station ones.  this one would be really scary.  and for homecoming -- well, you know how last year's theme was -
paul... paul.... we will have plenty of time to get into all this later.  a whole year, in fact. right now i just need to finish my pie and get home.
oh, okay.  yeah, sorry.
just one more thing.  so, mr. m., uh, do you think tracy's going to be okay? i saw her face after the assembly, and i think she is taking it pretty hard.
do not worry about tracy.  she will be fine.
life would go on, and i would certainly be a stronger and wiser person from the experience.
uh, jim?
hmm?
walt needs to see you.
oh.  okay.
you said i was a liar   you are the liar, you are the --
larry, you just take it easy
yo --
pierdo.
tu
pierdes.
el/ella -
pierde.
walt will be speaking with you about this, but i need you to find someone to take over my classes. the lesson plans for the rest of the year are in my top right drawer.
okay, jim. i understand.
thanks. well. I am going home now.
paul, will you sign my yearbook?
sure, tracy.
can i sign yours too?
oh, yeah, sure.  hey nolan, give my book to tracy when you are done*
yes, paul?
have a great summer.  and good luck at college.
thanks.  you too.  it was great working with you.
hello, mr. m.
hello, tracy.
so what brings you here?
I am looking at new cars.
oh.  new cars.  i see.  well, you came to the right place
my mother's buying me a new car for college.
huh.  right.  college.  wow.  where are you going?  where 'd you get into?
well, i got in everywhere i applied, but cornell is my first choice.
good for you.  good for you
so, are you looking for something sporty or more practical?
sporty.
where to?
anywhere you want.  just so long as we are not gone more than a half-hour.
handles pretty good, do not you think?
yeah.
plenty of pep, too.
uh-huh.
and this model comes with abs and dual air bags standard.
that sounds good.
so tracy?
yes?
why are you doing this?
doing what?
coming to see me.  are you trying to. . humiliate me?
nooo.  i just thought...  l mean, i am looking for a new car.  but i just thought, well, I am going away soon, and you will be stuck here and, i do not know, i just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. real friends.  and then things would be different.  do not you think?
well, i... i... that is very nice of you.
I have got an idea.
what is this?
my house.
i want you to do something for me.
swallows, unsure what heaven or hell awaits him.
i just have to get something. I will be right back.
oh, is this...?  god. first one of these i have not been in for a long time.
would you sign it for me?
what a surprise.
take as much room as you want
I am scared, mr. m. i kind of do not feel ready for college.
you will be fine.
i hope so
you will.
