rod says the sweetest things.
he is nuts about you.
yeah, nuts.
anyway, I am too tired to worry about the creep. could not get back to sleep at all.  so what you dream?
forget it, the point is, everybody has nightmares once in a while. no biggy.
i can not believe his mother let him come over here.
right. well, she didn't, exactly...
worked like a charm.
jesus.
nice to have a fire.
really. turn 'er up a little.
maybe we should call rod, have him come over too. he might get jealous.
rod and i are done. he is too much of a maniac.
what you dream?
i dreamed about this guy in a dirty red and yellow sweater; i dream in color, y'know; he walked into the room i was in, right, right through the wall, like it was smoke or something, and just stared at me. sort of... obscenely. then he walked out through the wall on the other side. like he would just come to check me out...
it is just a stupid cat.
then bring us back its tail and whiskers.
what the hell you doing here?
came to make up, no big deal. your ma home?
of course. what is that?
we got her mother's bed. you two got the rest.
we should get her out of here...
so we will guard her together. through the night.  in each others' arms like we always said.
glen. not now. i mean, we are here for tina now, not for ourselves.
why is she so bothered by a stupid nightmare, anyway?
because he was scary, that is why.
who was scary?
you feel better now, right?
jungle man fix jane.
no more fights?
no more fights.
good. no more nightmares for either of us then.
when did you have a nightmare?
guys can have nightmares too, y'know. you am not got a corner on the fucking market or something.
what the hell's going on!?
oh -- jeez -- glen! rod's gone ape!
you okay?
yeah. something slippery all over here...  tina?
lieutenant thompson. sorry to wake you, but --
i'd've canned your ass if you hadn't. what you got?
what is the coroner got to say?
something like a razor was the weapon, but nothing found on the scene.
looks like her boyfriend did it. rod lane. musician type, arrests for brawling, dope --
terrific. what the hell was she doing there?
she lived there.
i do not mean her --
how you doing, pal?
okay. hi, dad.
rod's not a lunatic.
you got a sane explanation for what he did?
apparently he was crazy jealous. nancy said they would had a fight, rod and tina.
it was not that serious...
maybe you do not think murder's serious --
she dreamed this would happen...
what?
she had a nightmare about somebody trying to kill her, last night. that is why we were there; she was afraid to sleep alone.
where you think you are going?
school.
i could hear you tossing and turning all night, kiddo. you have no business going to school.
did you sleep?
I will sleep in study hall, promise. I would rather keep busy, you know?
right home after.
right home after. see you.
your old man thinks i did it, do not he?
he does not know you.  could not you change?
the cops were all over my house.  they will kill me for sure.
nobody's going to kill you.
i never touched her.
you were screaming like crazy.
someone else was there.
the door was locked from your side.
you used me, daddy!
what the hell you doing going to school today, anyway -- your mother told me you did not even sleep last night!
decide to take a day off after all?
dad, i want to see rod lane.
only family allowed, nancy. you know the drill.
just want to talk to him a second.
he is dangerous.
you do not know he did it.
no, i know, thanks to your own testimony, that he was locked in a room with a girl who went in alive and came out in a rubber bag.
and then what happened?
i told you.  it was dark, but I am sure there was someone else in there, under the covers with her.
how could somebody get under the covers with you guys without you knowing it?
how the fuck do i know?  i do not expect you to believe me.
no.
well then how can you say somebody else was there?
because somebody cut her. while i watched.
what you mean 'all at once'?
i mean, it was as if there were four razors cutting her at the same time. but invisible razors. she just... opened up...
do you think i did it?
no.
nancy, do not fall asleep in there.
i won't.
get into bed.
i will.
what?
you are not falling asleep, are you? you could drown, you know.
mother, for petesakes.
it happens all the time.  I have got some warm milk all ready for you. why do not you jump into bed?  I am going to turn on your electric blanket, too. c'mon, now.
warm milk. gross.
you okay?
great
to bed with you, c'mon.
no television, forget the homework, no phone calls.
no, mother. yes, mother. no, mother.
and no school tomorrow, either. you take a little vacation, relax and rest for a change.
yes, mother. g'night.
take this, it will help you sleep.
right.
sometimes i wish you did not live right across the street.
shut up and let me in. you ever stand on a rose trellis in your bare feet?
guess i did.
have not slept, have you?
not really.
m'god, i look twenty years old.  you have any weird dreams last night?
slept like a rock.
well at least i have an objective wall to bounce this off.  you believe it is possible to dream about what is going to happen?
no.
you believe in the boogey man?
one two, freddie's coming for you? no. rod killed tina. he is a fruitcake and you know it.
you believe in anything?
i believe in you, me, and rock and roll. and I am not too sure about you lately.
listen, i got a crazy favor to ask.
uh-oh...
it is nothing too hard or anything.  I am just going to... look for someone, and... i want you to be sort of a... guard. okay?
okay?
okay, okay.  i think.
jesus, it is dark in here.
shhh. now listen, here's what we are going to do...
yeah. so?
just checking -- keep out of sight!
i must be going nuts...
nancy?
you okay?
yeah. just had a little dream. I am falling right back to sleep.
okay... you need anything, just call.
okay.
dad -- what you doing here?
it so happens i work here, and there is an unsolved murder. i do not like unsolved murders, especially ones my daughter's mixed up in -- what are you doing here at this hour? you are supposed to be getting some sleep.
nancy have any severe childhood illnesses? scarlet fever? high temperatures -- concussions?
no, nothing.
nightmares are expected after psychological trauma. do not worry, they go away.
i sure as hell hope so.
they are just simple tests, nan. we will both be right here.
look, i know it is been frightening, i know your dreams have seemed real. but... it is okay. okay?
please, nancy. trust us.
how long's this been going on?
since the murder. she was fine before that.
not to worry. no signs of pathology in nancy's eeg or pulse rate. I would guess what we have got is a normal young girl who just happens to have gone through two days of hell.
it is just made her think... her dreams are real...
okay, good. she is asleep.
thank god.
what the hell are dreams, anyway?
mysteries. incredible body hookus pokus. truth is we still do not know what they are or where they come from. as for nightmares...  did you know that in the last three years twenty filipino refugees in california died in the middle of nightmares? not from heart attacks, either. they just died.
what happened? that needle sank like a rock.
she is entering deep sleep now. heart rate's a little high due to anxiety, but otherwise she is nicely relaxed. all normal. she could dream at any time now.  right now she is like a diver on the bottom of an ocean no one's mapped yet. waiting to see what shows up.
how can you tell?
r.e.m.'s. rapid eye movements. the eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
oh my god, oh my god...
get the kit!
go even crazier?
i do not think you are going crazy -- and stop drinking that damn coffee!
did you ask daddy to have the hat examined?
i threw that filthy thing away -- i do not know what you are trying to prove with it, but --
what i learned at the dream clinic, that is what I am trying to prove. rod did not kill tina, and he did not hang himself. it is this guy -- he is after us in our dreams.
but that is just not reality, nancy!
it is real, mamma. feel it.
put that damned thing down!
screw sleep!
nancy!
whenever i get nervous i eat.
and if you can not do that, you sleep.
used to. not anymore.
you ever read about the balinese way of dreaming?
no.
they got a whole system they call 'dream skills'. so, if you have a nightmare, for instance like falling, right?
yeah.
instead of screaming and getting nuts, you say, okay, I am going to make up my mind that i fall into a magic world where i can get something special, like a poem or song.  they get all their art literature from dreams. just wake up and write it down. dream skills.
and what if they meet a monster in their dream? then what?
they turn their back on it.  takes away its energy, and it disappears.
what happens if they do not do that?
i guess those people do not wake up to tell what happens.
great.
'booby traps and improvised antipersonnel devices'!
i found it at this neat survivalist bookstore on ventura.
well what you reading it for?
what is with the bars?
s'curity.
mom, i want to know what you know about fred krueger.
dead and gone.
i want to know how, where -- if you do not tell me, I am going to call daddy.
your father the cop. that is a good one.  forget fred krueger. you do not want to know, believe me.
i do want to know. he is not dead and gone -- he is after me and if i sleep he will get me! I have got to know!
oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and fred krueger was free, just like that.
so he is alive?
bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. found him in an old boiler room, just like before. saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...
go on...
all these years you have kept those things buried down here? in our own house?
proof he is declawed. as for him, we buried him good and deep.
hello?
hi.
oh. hi, how y'doing?
much better.
i heard your ma went ape at the security store today. you look like the prisoner of zenda or something. how long's it been since you slept?
coming up on the seventh day. it is okay, i checked guiness. the record's eleven, and I will beat that if i have to.  listen, i... i know who he is.
who?
the killer.
you do?
yeah, and if he gets me, I am pretty sure you are next.
me!? why would anyone want to kill me?!
do not ask -- just give me some help nailing this guy when i bring him out.
bring him out of what?
my dream.
how you plan to do that?
just like i did the hat. have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
me?  wait a minute, you can not bring someone out of a dream!
if i can't, then you all can relax, because it will just be a simple case of me being nuts.
i can save you the trouble. you are nutty as a fruitcake. i love you anyway.
good, then you will not mind cold-cocking this guy when i bring him out.
what!?
you heard me. i grab him in the dream -- you see me struggling so you wake me up. we both come out, you cold cock the fucker, and we got him. clever, huh?
you crazy? hit him with what?
you are a jock. you must have a baseball bat or something. come to my window at midnight. and meanwhile...
meanwhile...?
meanwhile whatever you do do not fall asleep. midnight.
give me the key, mother.
i do not even have it on me, so forget it.
tell her I am not here, tell her...
uh, she just saw you, sir...
hello nancy.
hi daddy. i know what happened.
then you know more than i do -- i have not even been upstairs.
you know he is dead though, right?
I have got a proposition for you. listen very carefully, please.
nan, i --
please. I am going to go get the guy who did it and bring him to you. i just need you be right there to arrest him. okay?
just tell me who did it and I will go get him, baby.
fred krueger did it, daddy, and only i can get him. it is my nightmare he comes to.
-- i want you to come over here and break the door down exactly twenty minutes from now -- can you do that?
sure, but...
that will be exactly half past midnight. time for me to fall asleep and find him.
sure, sure, honey. you just do that -- get yourself some sleep -- that is what I have been saying all along.
and you will be here to catch him, right?
sure, okay, I will be there. now you just turn in and get some rest, sweetheart. please. deal?
deal.
get outside and watch her house. if you see anything funny call me.
'anything funny' like what?
guess i should'n'a done it.
just sleep now, mom.
just wanted to protect you, nan. just wanted to protect you...
who? who did that?
krueger.
krueger?
had to've done it. no one else was in there.
how you know that?
cause i thought glen was going to sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that is why. so i locked him in his room!  sorry. anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams.
maybe god's punishing us all...
keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we are talking about.
like rod lane?
dad! get us outta here!
oh, jesus -- nancy!  hey! we got a fire!
feeling better?
they say you have bottomed out when you can not remember the night before.  no more drinking, baby, suddenly i just do not feel like it any more.
