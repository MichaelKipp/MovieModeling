uh, yes..
business or pleasure?

san diego.
oh, san diego? I have thought about moving to san diego.  it is hard to make a living in this town. these short hops.  can not make a dime on 'em. to lax, pasadena, then i can make a buck. these little hops cost me money.
sorry.
's okay. what do you think?
huh?
better in san diego? more opportunity there? what?
i really do not know. i do not live there. i was just visiting...a grave.
aw, too bad.
somebody close?
what?
the grave. somebody close?
look...i've... I have got a problem. a big problem...
oh, yeah?
this says "invitation only".

its'...ah...about my daughter....
you were saying?  your daughter....?

of course.  i wish everything were that easy.
is that something precious?
no, that's,..that's fine
are you 'fucking with me!?
the gun...
what about the gun?
it was not loaded. i did not put the bullets in it.
you...
that is pretty good.
I have done much better ones than this.
you have, huh?
oh, yes. I will show you. i have much more colors at home.
that is good.  that is good, sweetie pie.
what do you do, if i may be so bold?
I am just an accountant.
do not denigrate yourself, my friend. where would the government be without accountants?  they would not know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, is not that right?
i have to do something.
what is that? you have to speak up.  I am a little deaf in this ear. between that and my wooden leg I am a mess. compliments of the united states army artillery corps.
i said i have to do something.
I will have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
is within himself.
you got anything smaller?
keep it.
it is a twenty.

you get another chance in ten minutes.
then i have time for a drink.
what would you do in my place?
me?
you got this under control?
yeah.
it does not look like it.
it is under control.
it better be.
what...?
tell me why i miss him.
he is dead?
that is right. he is dead. tell me why.
how should i...?
tell me why he is dead.
you killed him.
that is right, i killed him. he fucked up one too many times so i put a bullet in his eye. then i put two more into him just to make sure. now that was somebody i loved.
my wife always said i had a problem trusting people.
well, you can trust eleanor samara grant.
you do not understand. I am going to trust you. and you have to trust me.
yes, you are right, i do not understand.
look...my daughter ... she is going to die...unless you can help me.
all right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
no! you can't! they are in on it.
i do not see how they could be in on it. they are the best. they are hand- picked.
i do not know.
you have got to trust me. I am putting my daughter's life in your hands. she is only six. she is just a little girl. please, please, trust me.
it is a little hard to trust you under the circumstances.
the man following me has a walkie- talkie. if he sees I am not here he will call his partner. i do anything out of line and he will send the word to kill my daughter.
he will think you are in the crowd until the end of the speech. wait a minute.
are you sure?
I have heard this speech a lot. come on. we will take care of him.  we will.
but...
trust me. you asked me for help. let me help. trust me.
okay...
i think you better put that away.
i think you are right.
who is this? are you sure we can trust him?
I am sure. it is her husband. he is her campaign manager.
we have to hurry.
i know. brendan, listen to me. someone is trying to kill eleanor.
he brought a gun onto the pool deck.
what?
he got onto the pool deck with a gun. how did he get past her security carrying a
i see. where is this gun?
well, is it real? do we know anything about it?
it looks real. i do not know anything about guns.
could i see it?
somebody mind telling me... ) what the hell happened!?
help me get her off the rug.
i killed you.
you fucked up.
I am not stupid.. i know how this is supposed, to work.
do you now, mr. watson?
i kill her - and you kill me.
keep your voice down.
even if you don't, her security men will.
how am i supposed to get away?
that is not my problem, mr. watson
come back.
how do i know you will not kill my daughter once I am gone?
yeah.
do it!
again.
no, please...
you remember me?
i remember. the big tipper.
something is going to happen. when it is over you will know what i was talking about.
oh, man...
please. something is going to happen...
what? the end of the world? man, do not give me your mad rap. I am not a bartender. i do not want to hear it. i raise a family doing this bullshit. do me a favor. get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
please...
hey, a big tip does not give you the right to crap in my ear. you want change?  you got it, brother. what was that you gave me, a twenty?
one thirty. california ballroom.
that is right. that gives you...
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
let me talk to her again.
no.
i want'to talk to her.
forget about it.
i talk to her or you can forget about it.
do not you threaten me.
what are you going to do about it, shoot me?
you know what I am going to do.
what? walk out there and twist her arm off?
come back.
yeah.
put her on.
what gives?
just put her on.
yes, sweetie, it is me.
I am tired. i want to.go now.
i know you do, honey.
can we go now?
not just yet, baby. there's...there's something daddy has to do.
to be a hero?
no, honey, not to be a hero. but i want you to remember something for me, all right?
all right.
he is doing it for you. no matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he is doing it for you, because he loves you.
will you promise me that?
i promise.
all right. kisses to you.
no...kisses to you.
no. kisses to you.
no, kisses to...
mister, what are you dragging me into?
I am not dragging you into anything. i do not expect...
cover your mouth.
what?
this gorilla's watching you, is that right?
that is right.
then do not let him be seeing you talking to me. i do not want him twisting my arm off.
my daughter. they have her in a van across the street. they say they will kill her if i do not do something for them.
in twenty-five minutes in the california ballroom.
there was a woman. she was trying to help me. i watched him murder her.
what are you supposed to do?
kill the governor.
i knew i should have packed up and gone home as soon as i got that twenty. what am i supposed to do about this situation?
one of them is in on it. he might even be in charge. her security is in on it. there is only one person i know for sure is not in on it.
who?
the governor. if i could just talk to her...
oh, jesus ...
no way, there is nothing you can do to help me.
then why did you drag me into it?
it is my kid. I have got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
it is about time i did. i was one of those guys, workaholics. i worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  that is just what i thought i was supposed to do.
yeah, all right, listen...
so when she wanted a divorce...i was...i did not know what I would done wrong. i did not see it. i did not see it....
why do not you tell me about the early years some other time?
I am sorry. you understand i do not mind dying if i could save my daughter. i mean that.
yeah, now listen.  i can not mess with these shoes any more or it is going to look funny. you go down get yourself something to drink. make sure godzilla there, follows you.
what are you going to do?
keep the change.
do not think i won't.
where is he? did you lose him?
shut up.
meet irene.
hi.
irene is going to help.
thank you.
you said there was only one person you knew was not in on this thing.
yeah.
you are going to go see her.
what!?
what am i supposed to say to her?
it will come to you. see if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. save us all considerable embarrassment.
mrs. grant, governor...i will not hurt you.
my security people are right next door.
i appreciate that.
one loud scream will bring them in here instantly. you will not get very far. think it over.
if i were here to hurt you i would have done it already.
that's...a comfort to hear.
i have a problem.
ah.
only you can help me. I am also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, mrs. grant.
i remember you...in the elevator.
that is right.
you were very nervous.
it was because i had this...in my pocket
how do you know that?
i saw her die. she was shot. with this gun.
you shot her?
no.
who did?
i do not know. the only thing i know about him is that he works for your husband.
what?
and your husband works for somebody else.
what the hell are you saying?
i knew you would not believe me.
i said I would listen to you, not necessarily believe you. you are telling me my people are in a plot against me. you are telling me my husband wants me killed. what do you expect?
there is only one way to find out for sure. try to cancel the last speech.
I would prefer we did not refer to it as my last speech.
it is the last chance they have for me to kill you. try to get out of it. they will not let you. they can't. try to change the schedule and you will know I am right. what have you got to lose? it comes down to who you trust, them or me? test them.
i love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
this? I have never even fired one.
indeed.
well?
i do not know.
what are you going to do now?
what are you going to do!?
this is about power and you have not got any. there is nothing more you can do. I am sorry. thanks for trying.
get moving.
you' oughta learn to relax. i told you I have got it under control.
it is time. it is time now.
where are we going?
not very far, honey-pie. not far at all.
lousy. and i have siesta hair. I am thinking of canceling the speech.
it is an important speech.
during a campaign every speech is important. this is free media exposure. primetime news coverage that we could not buy.
what is he doing here?
who, him? just visiting.
do not remind me.
what happened here?
nothing. i broke a lamp.
truth is, besides the headache I have come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. make my apologies.
come on, el, you are a trooper. I will get you some pepto, you will make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to sacramento. this is no time to lay down on the job. i do not care what the polls say, you can not afford to relax. look what happened to bush. tell you what, if you want to blow off the sacramento speech, fine. but do this one and we will get out of the smog.
all right, I will do it.
that is my girl.
but i want to make some changes. get krista in here right away will not you?
aw, gee. i sent her on an errand.
you sent my assistant on an errand.
I have been a bad boy.
I am not a baby.
you are a big girl, huh?
I am not a big girl but I am not a baby.
close your eyes.
why?
I have got something for you.
a surprise?
you ask too many questions. you want the surprise or not?
just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. only cost you a dollar.
i do not want my windshield cleaned.
you just think you do not want your windshield cleaned.
no, i know i do not want it cleaned. get out of here.
do not be like that. think of me as the moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.
for the last time, i do not want it cleaned. now get the hell out of here!
it is already done. I have already done it. you have to pay me now.
i do not have to pay you nothin'.
you are going to deny me a lousy dollar after I have sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
fuckin' a.
i do not think so.
hey!
i think this is worth a dollar.
oh, we will have to do better than that.
you worthless piece of shit! gimme that!
goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here!
gimme a dollar.
fuck you!
i...1 would like to...thank you, mister wat... gene.
i would also like to apologize.
for what?
for not believing you.
believe me, i do not blame you.  this is the governor, lynn. say hello.
can we go now?
of course. I will get a car to drive you.
no, that's... that is ok. we do not need any help. we will be just fine. will not we, lynn?
good luck.
same to you.
thanks for the shine.
thanks for the tip.
