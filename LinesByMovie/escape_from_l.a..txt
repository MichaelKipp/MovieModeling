comstat did a psychosearch on him. used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. he hit the bottom of the curve.
perfect for the mission. nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
zero emotional developments. total lack of compassion. a highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.
how you doin' plissken?  you like the watch?
you assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. what'ya want?
somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. we don't know how.
utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. she'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  somebody else was in there with her.
shut up, plissken.
what's the little black box do?
top secret. only on a need to know.
and i don't need to know. so fuck you, i'm goin' to hollywood.
that's right, big shot. unless you do what we want you're not coming back.
so what's the deal, huh? go into l.a., find the president's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and i'm free?
that's the deal.
tell the president to adopt. i think i'll like l.a.
it's the president, for christ's sake!
i give you my word. put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
i can see you're real concerned about your daughter.
utopia is lost to me. my daughter is gone.
well, i'll think it over.
you're running out of time.
i've been doin' that all my life. might as well do it in l.a. everybody else there is.
wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
having second thoughts?
maybe. but you're not putting any shit in me this time.
you don't understand. it's already in you.
the cigarette girl in new vegas was an undercover cop. she injected you with incentive toxin. right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. it'll start to take effect in 9 hours.
it's a strain of the plutoxin 7 virus. genetically engineered. 100% pure death. complete nervous system shutdown. you crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. not a pretty sight.
get this crap out of me.
i guess we have a deal. nice to be working with you, plissken.
call me snake.
l.a. is in a constant state of warfare. gangs fighting for the right to rule.
heavy third world connections. they get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
some areas have power - they're on line to san onofre.
i'll need to know more about this thing.
only a handful of people are aware of its existence. let's just say it's the ultimate defensive weapon.
defense against what?
there's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
third world wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. the cubans and brazilians are ready to invade miami. if the africans and colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the united states.
so what does this thing do?
all you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m.
where do i put ashore?
cahuenga pass. make your way up through the mountains toward the hollywood bowl. you should be able to pick up utopia's tracer there.  once you go inside, you're on your own.  you know what you have to do with the girl, don't you?  we have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
so you want me to take her out?  is that an order from the president?
let's just say it's what's best for the country.
by the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
a medical team will be standing by.
not you?
no.
good.
she's in the green.
lock fuel rods.
locked.
nuclear turbine to 75% power.
75% power.
hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. launch.
his reactor's starting to overheat.
plissken, slow down the sub. you're overloading the power plant.
plissken...?
i'm here.
where's the submarine? it's disappeared off our screens.
it's history. i gotta go.
kind of a bad neighborhood, snake.
which way to the hollywood bowl?
down that way.
hey, what's going down, snake?
i'm looking for somebody.
who ain't?
you're a star in your own right, you know that? hey, i'm map to the stars eddie. how you doin'?
where'd they go?
man, i'd love to have your autograph, snake.
where are they?
who? you mean cuervo jones? he's the man with the juice, snake. got the president's daughter. setting up a citywide truce. big doings.
location.
cuervo's got a place near venice, where the big birds fly. nice digs, too. i've been there, y'know.
hi, snake. it's so great to meet you. my name's taslima. i'm a fan of yours.
are you crazy?
a little bit. but pretty soon i'm gonna be dead. so are you, snake.
what are they?
they live here, used to be like us. but after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. the only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  snake, nobody who comes into beverly hills gets out alive.
no screamin' shit.
oh no, it's the doctor.
who?
the surgeon general of beverly hills.
don't follow me.
you need help.
like hell i do.
this is a dead end.  you took us into a dead end!
i just thought you wanted to get away. i didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
be careful of the bald cats. they live in these buildings.
the what?
how do we get out of here?
sewers. come on.
snake - what is it?
how the hell am i supposed to know? this is your damn city.
what're you doing in here?
looking to get out.
good. i want you out. this is my sewer.
which way?
why don't you get out of l.a.? take a boat to china, take an airplane to brazil?  earthquakes, death, shit. why do you stay?
i don't know. somehow, i just can't leave.
say, you need anything, snake? guns? explosives? i can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
yeah. so how do i get to venice?
all the sewers are collapsed under venice. you have to go topside. right up there.
i changed my mind. i'm going with you, wherever you're going.
what the hell is this?
the freeway.
i know that. there are people in some of these cars.
it's where they live. i guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. during the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.
what are you gonna do in venice?
find cuervo jones.
no! stay away, snake. he's mucho muerte.
run, snake...they're coming.
who?
too many people know where you're going, snake. that's not good. delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.
delgado?
cuervo jones' right-hand man. one tough hombre. you don't understand, snake. cuervo jones wants to unify the island. we're on the move, man. big time.
stop the damn car.
no way.
i said pull over.
all right. anything for you, snake.  although i was going to take you to cuervo jones' place.
where is it?
right over there.
come on, cuervo. i delivered him, didn't i? all i'm asking for is what you promised.
we'll see.
who's that?
you never heard of snake plissken?
he doesn't look like his picture.  i bet he's fake.
now go get dressed. we have things to do.
are we going to eat soon? i'm starved.
ooww!
go on now. do as i say.
where are they going?
oh, man... you didn't have to hit me, snake. i can help you.
not yet.
i could've helped you. we coulda made a deal with cuervo. if you'd listen...
where is he?
he jumped. down there.  he's dead, cuervo. i did it. i killed plissken.
give it to me.
you said i could be vice-president, cuervo. your right-hand man.
give it.
sure, cuervo, but look here. i've done it all, man. i killed plissken, i got your girl back, i got it all. just for you, cuervo. just for you.
cuervo...?
you're my woman, you understand? you don't let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
i tried...
nobody leaves cuervo jones. not unless you give your life. you fight till you're dead. then i forgive you.  understand?  understand?
yes...
getting ready to invade.
so where's plissken?
could be a big one comin' any minute now...
where's... cuervo jones...?
long gone. you'll never catch up with him now, snake.
where?
anaheim. headquarters for everything. the whole town's gonna be there. things changin' fast around here, snake. it's not the same as the old days, man.
you ain't doin' so good, snake. you need help.  you should talk to hershe. she hates cuervo. they used to be partners, but they split up.
who?
hershe. she lives downtown with mojo dellasandro in the big boat. down that way.
listen up. i need directions. downtown. somebody named hershe.
sure, snake. no problem.  you gonna kill me?
later.
i couldn't help it, snake. i had to shoot you. cuervo made me do it, i swear to god, man.
cease fire with the bullshit.
right. keep goin' straight. two blocks down, turn right.
the prototype appears to be armed, mr. president.  shall i begin evacuation?
does he know how to activate it?
well, yeah. all you have to do is push the button.
i need a favor.
what's in it for me?
wait a minute. i know that voice.  you're carjack malone.
not anymore.
you owe me. you left me holdin' everything back there in cleveland.
hershe, you were in cleveland?
yeah. with me and texas mike o'shay.
i was called away on urgent business, snake.
don't lie to me.
all right, so i made another deal.
i got a new deal for you.
i wouldn't be doin' that, snake.
we have a little arrangement. anything happens to me, you're dead.
i'm already dead.
i see your point. what's the favor?
get me to cuervo jones. get me to the kingdom. i got one hour.
dream on, blue eye.
say goodnight, carjack.
wait a minute. all right. hold on.
cuervo jones has more firepower than two armies. no one gets near him.
how do you know all this?
i used to represent the guy who invented it. i swear to god, snake. no bullshit.
so what's the deal, gorgeous?
we get the girl and the prototype. and we get out.
all of us?
yeah.
me too?
we'll see.
why should we leave? i love l.a. where we gonna go? what's the payoff?
i'd like to get out but i don't have enough money.
the president's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
yeah? greenbacks? i got ten million of them.
uh-uh. bluebacks.
aw, come on, snake.
bluebacks. i'm not bullshittin'. i swear to god.
i don't know, sounds thin to me.
you want to stay here, while cuervo jones rules the world?
no, that sucks.  how are we getting out?
i don't know yet.
shit.
you always were a loser, plissken. makin' things up as you go along. that's why i cut out on you in cleveland. you're just a bum like the rest of us.
i don't know about this thing.
don't like it, don't come.
where'd you get these rigs, carjack?
my name is hershe hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
i got an idea, snake.  this looks like the prototype, right?
yeah, kinda.
so maybe we can pull off a texas switch on cuervo.
if he lets you get close enough.
see you in hell, snake.
if i'm late, carjack, don't start without me.
is that what i think it is?
yeah. the place kept changing owners. finally went bankrupt. that thing in paris killed 'em.
you're about to get hit, cuervo. it's plissken.
you told me he was dead.
i thought he was, but he came back.
where?
oh cuervo...
what?
it's so good to see you again.
where's plissken?
he's... near.
you're stalling, eddie.  talk, you little gringo!
cuervo, look out behind you!
she's overloaded! we're too heavy.
somebody get off!
get ready, shitheads. we're comin' in.
thank god.
plissken - this is malloy. do you have the prototype?
yeah, i got it.
i think we've burned off enough fuel. we may be lighter enough to hover. just barely.
can you land?
no. the right skid's broken. if i try to set it down she'll crash. i have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  hey, carjack. we gotta hide the girl. give her your dress.
my name is no longer carjack. will you please get that through your fucking head?
where's the anti-toxin...?
give me the prototype.
you were injected with glucose. there is no plutoxin 7 virus. you were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
c'mon, snake - it's l.a. everything's phony, you know that.
relax, war hero. we took you for a ride, and you came through. not bad for a dirtbag like you.
you're free, plissken. but if you even so much as break wind on a country road i'll crush you like a bug.
got a smoke?
you're gonna have to learn to respect the law, snake. the united states is a no- smoking nation. no smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. it's a brand new day for you, snake.
the name's plissken.
