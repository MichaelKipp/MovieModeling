comstat did a psychosearch on him. used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. he hit the bottom of the curve.
perfect for the mission. nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
zero emotional developments. total lack of compassion. a highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.
how you doin' plissken?  you like the watch?
you assholes did not bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. what'ya want?
somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. we do not know how.
utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. she would punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.  somebody else was in there with her.
shut up, plissken.
what is the little black box do?
top secret. only on a need to know.
and i do not need to know. so fuck you, I am goin' to hollywood.
that is right, big shot. unless you do what we want you are not coming back.
so what is the deal, huh? go into l.a., find the president's daughter, secure the box, and bring 'em both out - and I am free?
that is the deal.
tell the president to adopt. i think I will like l.a.
it is the president, for christ's sake!
i give you my word. put the prototype into my hands, and you are a free man.
i can see you are real concerned about your daughter.
utopia is lost to me. my daughter is gone.
well, I will think it over.
you are running out of time.
I have been doin' that all my life. might as well do it in l.a. everybody else there is.
wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
having second thoughts?
maybe. but you are not putting any shit in me this time.
you do not understand. it is already in you.
the cigarette girl in new vegas was an undercover cop. she injected you with incentive toxin. right now it is swimming in your bloodstream. it will start to take effect in 9 hours.
it is a strain of the plutoxin 7 virus. genetically engineered. 100% pure death. complete nervous system shutdown. you crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. not a pretty sight.
get this crap out of me.
i guess we have a deal. nice to be working with you, plissken.
call me snake.
l.a. is in a constant state of warfare. gangs fighting for the right to rule.
heavy third world connections. they get weapons, drugs, fuel, choppers - everything is pumped into the island from the south.
some areas have power - they are on line to san onofre.
I will need to know more about this thing.
only a handful of people are aware of its existence. let's just say it is the ultimate defensive weapon.
defense against what?
there is a war about to be declared, or did not you know?
third world wants to live like we do - and they plan on taking what they want. the cubans and brazilians are ready to invade miami. if the africans and colombians make a run at the border, we got a full scale attack on the united states.
so what does this thing do?
all you need to know is get it back here by 5 a.m.
where do i put ashore?
cahuenga pass. make your way up through the mountains toward the hollywood bowl. you should be able to pick up utopia's tracer there.  once you go inside, you are on your own.  you know what you have to do with the girl, do not you?  we have to spare this nation her trial - for treason.
so you want me to take her out?  is that an order from the president?
let's just say it is what is best for the country.
by the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
a medical team will be standing by.
not you?
no.
good.
she is in the green.
lock fuel rods.
locked.
nuclear turbine to 75% power.
75% power.
hands on switches and counting. 5...4...3...2...1. launch.
his reactor's starting to overheat.
plissken, slow down the sub. you are overloading the power plant.
plissken...?
I am here.
where is the submarine? it is disappeared off our screens.
it is history. i got to go.
kind of a bad neighborhood, snake.
which way to the hollywood bowl?
down that way.
hey, what is going down, snake?
I am looking for somebody.
who ain't?
you are a star in your own right, you know that? hey, I am map to the stars eddie. how you doin'?
where did they go?
man, I would love to have your autograph, snake.
where are they?
who? you mean cuervo jones? he is the man with the juice, snake. got the president's daughter. setting up a citywide truce. big doings.
location.
cuervo's got a place near venice, where the big birds fly. nice digs, too. I have been there, y'know.
hi, snake. it is so great to meet you. my name's taslima. I am a fan of yours.
are you crazy?
a little bit. but pretty soon I am going to be dead. so are you, snake.
what are they?
they live here, used to be like us. but after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. the only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.  snake, nobody who comes into beverly hills gets out alive.
no screamin' shit.
oh no, it is the doctor.
who?
the surgeon general of beverly hills.
do not follow me.
you need help.
like hell i do.
this is a dead end.  you took us into a dead end!
i just thought you wanted to get away. i did not know you wanted to go someplace.
be careful of the bald cats. they live in these buildings.
the what?
how do we get out of here?
sewers. come on.
snake - what is it?
how the hell am i supposed to know? this is your damn city.
what are you doing in here?
looking to get out.
good. i want you out. this is my sewer.
which way?
why do not you get out of l.a.? take a boat to china, take an airplane to brazil?  earthquakes, death, shit. why do you stay?
i do not know. somehow, i just can not leave.
say, you need anything, snake? guns? explosives? i can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
yeah. so how do i get to venice?
all the sewers are collapsed under venice. you have to go topside. right up there.
i changed my mind. I am going with you, wherever you are going.
what the hell is this?
the freeway.
i know that. there are people in some of these cars.
it is where they live. i guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they would always done before. during the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.
what are you gonna do in venice?
find cuervo jones.
no! stay away, snake. he is mucho muerte.
run, snake...they're coming.
who?
too many people know where you are going, snake. that is not good. delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.
delgado?
cuervo jones' right-hand man. one tough hombre. you do not understand, snake. cuervo jones wants to unify the island. we are on the move, man. big time.
stop the damn car.
no way.
i said pull over.
all right. anything for you, snake.  although i was going to take you to cuervo jones' place.
where is it?
right over there.
come on, cuervo. i delivered him, did not i? all I am asking for is what you promised.
we will see.
who is that?
you never heard of snake plissken?
he does not look like his picture.  i bet he is fake.
now go get dressed. we have things to do.
are we going to eat soon? I am starved.
ooww!
go on now. do as i say.
where are they going?
oh, man... you did not have to hit me, snake. i can help you.
not yet.
i could have helped you. we coulda made a deal with cuervo. if you would listen...
where is he?
he jumped. down there.  he is dead, cuervo. i did it. i killed plissken.
give it to me.
you said i could be vice-president, cuervo. your right-hand man.
give it.
sure, cuervo, but look here. I have done it all, man. i killed plissken, i got your girl back, i got it all. just for you, cuervo. just for you.
cuervo...?
you are my woman, you understand? you do not let anybody take you away from me without a fight.
i tried...
nobody leaves cuervo jones. not unless you give your life. you fight till you are dead. then i forgive you.  understand?  understand?
yes...
getting ready to invade.
so where is plissken?
could be a big one comin' any minute now...
where's... cuervo jones...?
long gone. you will never catch up with him now, snake.
where?
anaheim. headquarters for everything. the whole town's going to be there. things changin' fast around here, snake. it is not the same as the old days, man.
you am not doin' so good, snake. you need help.  you should talk to hershe. she hates cuervo. they used to be partners, but they split up.
who?
hershe. she lives downtown with mojo dellasandro in the big boat. down that way.
listen up. i need directions. downtown. somebody named hershe.
sure, snake. no problem.  you gonna kill me?
later.
i could not help it, snake. i had to shoot you. cuervo made me do it, i swear to god, man.
cease fire with the bullshit.
right. keep goin' straight. two blocks down, turn right.
the prototype appears to be armed, mr. president.  shall i begin evacuation?
does he know how to activate it?
well, yeah. all you have to do is push the button.
i need a favor.
what is in it for me?
wait a minute. i know that voice.  you are carjack malone.
not anymore.
you owe me. you left me holdin' everything back there in cleveland.
hershe, you were in cleveland?
yeah. with me and texas mike o'shay.
i was called away on urgent business, snake.
do not lie to me.
all right, so i made another deal.
i got a new deal for you.
i would not be doin' that, snake.
we have a little arrangement. anything happens to me, you are dead.
I am already dead.
i see your point. what is the favor?
get me to cuervo jones. get me to the kingdom. i got one hour.
dream on, blue eye.
say goodnight, carjack.
wait a minute. all right. hold on.
cuervo jones has more firepower than two armies. no one gets near him.
how do you know all this?
i used to represent the guy who invented it. i swear to god, snake. no bullshit.
so what is the deal, gorgeous?
we get the girl and the prototype. and we get out.
all of us?
yeah.
me too?
we will see.
why should we leave? i love l.a. where we going to go? what is the payoff?
I would like to get out but i do not have enough money.
the president's promised to give whoever helps me 1 million dollars.
yeah? greenbacks? i got ten million of them.
uh-uh. bluebacks.
aw, come on, snake.
bluebacks. I am not bullshittin'. i swear to god.
i do not know, sounds thin to me.
you want to stay here, while cuervo jones rules the world?
no, that sucks.  how are we getting out?
i do not know yet.
shit.
you always were a loser, plissken. makin' things up as you go along. that is why i cut out on you in cleveland. you are just a bum like the rest of us.
i do not know about this thing.
do not like it, do not come.
where did you get these rigs, carjack?
my name is hershe hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
i got an idea, snake.  this looks like the prototype, right?
yeah, kinda.
so maybe we can pull off a texas switch on cuervo.
if he lets you get close enough.
see you in hell, snake.
if I am late, carjack, do not start without me.
is that what i think it is?
yeah. the place kept changing owners. finally went bankrupt. that thing in paris killed 'em.
you are about to get hit, cuervo. it is plissken.
you told me he was dead.
i thought he was, but he came back.
where?
oh cuervo...
what?
it is so good to see you again.
where is plissken?
he's... near.
you are stalling, eddie.  talk, you little gringo!
cuervo, look out behind you!
she is overloaded! we are too heavy.
somebody get off!
get ready, shitheads. we are comin' in.
thank god.
plissken - this is malloy. do you have the prototype?
yeah, i got it.
i think we have burned off enough fuel. we may be lighter enough to hover. just barely.
can you land?
no. the right skid's broken. if i try to set it down she will crash. i have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  hey, carjack. we got to hide the girl. give her your dress.
my name is no longer carjack. will you please get that through your fucking head?
where is the anti-toxin...?
give me the prototype.
you were injected with glucose. there is no plutoxin 7 virus. you were never going to die - at least not from anything we gave you.
c'mon, snake - it is l.a. everything's phony, you know that.
relax, war hero. we took you for a ride, and you came through. not bad for a dirtbag like you.
you are free, plissken. but if you even so much as break wind on a country road I will crush you like a bug.
got a smoke?
you are going to have to learn to respect the law, snake. the united states is a no- smoking nation. no smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you are married, no guns, no foul language. it is a brand new day for you, snake.
the name's plissken.
