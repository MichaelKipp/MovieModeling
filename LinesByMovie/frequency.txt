pal, my whole life's an emergency.
where are you transmitting from?
queens, new york.
whatta ya know.  bayside, born and raised.
i thought these things were for talkin' around the world.
15-band closes down at night.  during the day you can chew the band with china if you want.
i can not believe people are still using these things.
sorry 'bout that.  so queens, you psyched for the series?
i do not really follow baseball anymore.
what?
i got fed up with all the bullshit.
fed up?  lemme tell you something, in a 1000 years, when school kids study america, they are going to learn about three things: the constitution, rock 'n' roll, and baseball.
I am right with you, man.  he is got the heart of a lion.  hey, how 'bout the first game of the series?
yeah.  it was all over after buford nailed seaver's first pitch outta the park.
frankie, johnny wants to say goodnight.
sure.
lucky throw, fire boy.
luck, my ass.
do not choke on your pride, sull.  you am not ever going to catch another one like that.
she made up her mind.  nothin' i do is going to change it.
nothing you are willing to do.
i thought it would be nicer to eat here.
sounds good.
I am sorry sam could not make it.
yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
I am sure everything'll work out.  she really loves you...
so how are things at the hospital?
fine.  you know dr. schwartz retired last month?
no kidd'n, he musta been pushing 90!

so how did you like lion king?
oh, i loved it.  i wish you would gone.

what are you talking about?  I am talking about this afternoon.
this afternoon?
daddy, come up and sing the baseball.
I will be up soon, little chief.
sorry 'bout that.
what did you just say?
oh, that was my kid.
you call your son little chief?
uh huh...
what did you say your name was?
frank...frank sullivan.
is this some kind of joke?  gordo is that you?  are you fucking with me?
look pal, I am just askin' how you...
you are telling me your name is frank sullivan, you live in queens and you just saw the first game of the '69 series...live?
right...and I am asking how you called the game.
gordo, if this is you, so help me...
what the hell does gordy have to do with it?
what did you say your station...uh, your call letters were?
w...b...2...yxb.
now you listen to me.  my name is john francis sullivan, i live at 1060 41st, where I have lived my whole life.  and i saw the first game of the '69 series at my uncle butch's house with my father...
what?
29-years ago.
29 years...?
my dad's name was frank patrick sullivan, he was a fire fighter and a die-hard mets fan.  and every night when i went to bed he sang to me...  take me out to the ball game, take me out with the crowd...
what the hell...
I am dreaming this.  shit, this is a dream.
I am not dreaming.
what is going on?
nothing...i just spilled something.
oh my god.
what?
you just burned the desk.
what is happening?
that is impossible.
what if it is not...
dad...?
johnny...?
how could this be happening?
i do not know.
we gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
sun spot?
yeah, that is how hams work.
wait a sec...there was something on the news.  something about this space anomaly.  i think they said it was connected to some storm in '69.
you sound...ground up...?
I am thirty-five years old.
thirty-five?  that would make it...
1998.
1998...?  this is wrong.  who are you? why are you doing this?
I am not doing anything.  look, i do not know what is going on.  but i swear on my life, i"m here at your old desk, on your ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
it is really you, is not it?
yeah...i think so.
no, not yet.
too busy playin' ball, huh?
nah, i gave it up.
you are still my little chief, right?
I am trying to be, dad.  I am tyrin'.  it is good to hear your voice.  i missed you...so much.
what is that?
i think I am losing you.
no wait, do not go!
it is okay.  I am still here, chief.
but you are not...you're not still here.
what are you talking about?
i lost you.
what?
i never knew you, dad.
why?
fire.
on the job?
it was an abandoned warehouse - hit by lightening.  butch told ma it was just one wrong turn. said it was not your fault.  you went with the training, with your instincts.  if you would just gone left instead of right, you would have made it.
that can not be...that's not going to happen.
it did, pop.  it did.
when?
october 12, 1969.
but that is tomorrow.
tomorrow.  jesus...it has not happened. it does not have to happen.
do not go.  do not go in that warehouse...
i do not understand.
sull!  what the hell!
i talked to him gordo.  i talked to my dad.
c'mon, man.  get inside.  I will come over. we will play some nintendo.
no.  i got to tell him the address, so he does not go in.
go in where?
the warehouse.  buxton seeds.  it is tomorrow.
i know pal.  i remember.  twenty-nine years tomorrow.
frank.  hey, man.  you alright?
I am alright, gibby.
how you feeling?
better.
it looks open on the other side.
do not know what is behind it.
one way to find out.
gotta be another way up, frank.
then fuckin' find it.  I am going for the girl.
you okay, man?
elvis has left the building.
john.  john, you all right?
longbranch...?
what?
you are not looking too good.
whoa, i just...i just...
my father did not die in a fire?
huh?
my father did not die in a fire?
fire?  what are you talking about?  he had cancer, john.
cancer.  it was the cigarettes.  right? the cigarettes?
yeah, lung cancer.  ten years ago.
maybe you outta lay off a little...
gordo, i was not dreaming.  i talked to him, it was real.
huh?
the ham radio.  that is how come he did not die in the fire.
I am scared.
do not be scared.  this time I am right behind you if you fall.
daddy, daddy, i can't.
no, but we can.  we can do it together. spirit and guts, chief.
you ready?
wait...
I am right here behind you...
yes!  that is it!  you got it, you got it! way to go, chief!
I am doing it!  I am doing it!
dad...?
chief?!  is that you?
yeah, it is me.
you are the voice of an angel, johnny.  if you had not told me, no way i would'a ever made it.
dad, you there?  you okay?
yeah.  I am okay.  what about you?  i want to know.  about you.  and your mom.
we are doing all right, dad.  we are doing good.
tell me.
it is hard to explain.  something happened today.  it was like a dream.  and when i woke up i had all these new memories. good times.  times we never had before.
I am glad.
dad, i gotta tell you this...cause you should know.  cause i still remember.
what, johnny?  what is it?
what it was like when you died in the fire...
frank...what's wrong?
nothing.  i just wanted to see you.
where is johnny?
i tucked him in at gordo's.
you give him his drops?
one in each ear.  what would you do without me?
probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work...
i love you, bud.
i love you more.
another rough night, huh?  that it?
yeah.  that is it.
this is getting real old, john.  and I am tired up to here with it...
I am sorry.  i just...you know...i...
and I am tired of the I am sorrys.  i do not need 'em.  what i need is a partner i can count on.  i care about you.  not cause of me and your old man.  not cause of your mom. but because of you.
she makes ten.
ten?  no.  i remember this case.  three. he killed three women.
what are you talking'?  you know better than anybody, john.  you have read this file a thousand times.
boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
he am not the only one.
I am off.
wish you weren't.
do you know how much i love you?
right here, chief.  sorry i lost you last night.  damn thing keeps cutting out.
dad...dad... there's... i need to...
are you alright"?
something happened, something...
what?  johnny, what is wrong?
it is mom.
what?  what is it?
she is not here.
whatta you mean she is not here?
she...she died.  it is like it just happened.
she just died, your mother just died?
no dad, it happened a long time ago, a long time ago for me.
when?
october 22, 1969.
jesus christ...that's...ten days from now.  how?
murdered?  why?
there was this case.  a serial.  he murdered three women, all nurses, between '68 and '69.  the papers called them the nightingale murders.  they never caught him.  but the killings just stopped.
what kinda twisted animal.
dad, we did something.  something to make it worse.
whatta you mean...
he did not just kill three women anymore. he killed ten.
what are you talking about?
something we did changed the case...changed history.  mom was not dead.  but then after you did not die in the fire something must have happened.  and this guy, this nightingale guy, he kept on killing...it was like a spree...seven more women.
i got to take her away, john.  I am going to take your mother away.  he can not hurt her if i take her away.
i do not know...  what about the other women?
I will warn them.
that will never work.  they will just think you are crazy.
what can we do?  you do not even know who this guy is.
no.  nobody got...  wait a minute.  i might not know who he is, but i know where he is going to be.  i got the case file.  we know what he is going to do before he does it.
so what should i do?  call the police? you think they will believe me?
they will if they catch him in the act. you can make that happen, dad.  you can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
i do not know, john.  I am a fire fighter. this is...this is different.
i do know.  I am a cop.  this is what i do.
you ever talk to a victim's family?  the one's left behind?  they do not act like what you would think.  there is panic and fear.  but mostly, it is like there is this logic problem.  and if they could only solve it, everything would be okay.  but if you look real close - look at their eyes - you can see it.  just a glimmer.  but somewhere they know.  they know their world is never going to be the same.
what if the radio stops working?  christ, what if i can not reach you again?
then you get mom the hell out.  but dad, those other women were not supposed to die.  we do not try to stop this guy, we are going to live with that for the rest of our lives.
why not just get the cops to watch the bar?
they will question her.  whatever they tell her could change what happens.  no, i want you to follow her.  see if anybody's watching her, hittin' on her. I am betting somebody is going to walk outta that bar with her.  when they do, you call the cops.
what do i tell them?
tell 'em there is a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
that is what we need here, satch.  a lucky break.
that was not luck, johnny boy.  that was smarts and ten plus on the job.
our lucky break.  mario id'd the dental. mary finelli...reported missing april 16, 1968.
april 16...?  that means she was the first.
which means he probably knew her.
this case just got hot.  we pull on this string...
there is something i got to take care of. something i need to tell you about.
okay...
I have been talking to this...guy...this cop...on the ham...and, uh, he...
honey, what is it?  just tell me.
I have been talking to johnny...on the radio.
i know.  he loves that thing.
no.  not our johnny.  i mean, it is johnny...but not now...in the future.
I will be upstairs...if you want to play.
I am serious.
so am i.
I will be damned.
did you see him?  do you know who he is?
no.  i just kept talking to her.  there was a lot of guys in that bar - could'a been any of 'em.
it is okay.  this is working.  this is going to work.
whatta we do now?
sissy clark, 190 riverside dr., apartment 3c.  tomorrow.  she is a nursing student.  paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the peppermint lounge, on west 63rd.  left work at two a m...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
got it.
dad, i think i may be able to get you enough information to make sure the da can nail this bastard.
how?
coupla days ago they dug up a body in washington heights - mary finelli.  girl disappeared in '68.  turns out she was his first kill.  which means he probably knew her.  most serials know their first victim.  I am going to do some checking - see if i can put any of this together...
all right, I am with you.  i just hope we know what the hell we are doing.
tell me something good, chief.  tell me about the future.
well they found out cigarettes give you lung cancer.
what else, john.  it must be different, huh?  are people living on the moon?
did not happen, we got enough problems down here.
what are we like in...1998?
we are okay...we're good, dad.
hey, what about the amazin's?  they pull it off?
you really wanna know?
yeah, you betcha.
well, game five was the big one.  it turned in the bottom of the 6th.  we were down 3-0.  cleon jones gets hit on the foot - left a scuff mark on the ball. clendenon comes up.  the count goes to 2 2.  high fastball.  he nailed it.  weis slammed a solo shot in the 7th to tie. jones and swoboda scored in the 8th.  we won, pop.
wow.
hang on a sec, john.
you there?
jules, i want you to say hello to somebody...  I am on with john - that guy i told you about.
the future guy?
yeah, but, no kidding around, he is a good guy, a real good guy...
john, say hello to my wife...julia.
h-hi.
hey, future boy.  frank tells me you are a cop?
yeah, that is right.
my six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman.  right after he retires from the majors.  we just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
yeah...i remember.  i used to play cops and robbers but y-- ...my mom would not let me have a toy gun.
you are mom sounds like she is got some smarts.
she is pretty special.
are you a good cop, john?
i try to be.
then I will bet she is real proud of you, huh?
yeah.  i just wish I would told her how proud i was of her.
I am sorry.  i did not realize...  but she knew, john.  a mother knows what is in her son's heart.
this is the space cowboy.  I am an intergalactic traveler from the federation planet earth.
gordo?
how did you know my name, mister?
i better give you my address then.
oh do not worry kid, i know where you live.  now i want you to go upstairs and write this down, buy yahoo. you got that space cowboy.  y-a-h-o-o. it is a magic word and i never want you to forget it.
you got a deal, mister.  i mean santa.
john, you still there?
I am right here, dad.
you all right?
yeah, i think so...
do not worry, chief.  I am not going to let anything happen to her...no matter what.
okay, lemme walk you through it.
mind if i shake it off first...so's i can concentrate better.
i ran him through bci...got a hit. busted for sexual assault: march 22, 1970.  eight days after the last nightingale murder.
so you figure the murders stop 'cause he is off the street.  then by the time he gets paroled, he is smartened up enough to control himself?
not the first time that is been true.  I am telling you, i got a feeling about this guy.  this is the guy, satch.
uh, huh.
what?
I am just trying to figure what interests me more: the possibility that daryl is the guy, or you making him absolutely the guy.
that was over thirty years ago.  i paid for that and then some.
you go to xavier high school, daryl?
yeah.
you remember mary finelli?
what are you saying?
you know what I am saying.
no, i don't.
well, i think you do.
sexual assault, daryl.  five years.  but you got lucky, right?  you got away with something else.  something you figured nobody knows about.
what i know is what i told you.
let me tell you what i know, daryl.  you went to saint xavier with mary.  you lived five blocks from her.  you liked her.  but she am not interested.  that must have hurt, huh?
so what?
so, what did you do about it, daryl?
nothing.
oh, my god!  what is that?!  why you showing me this shit!?  jesus!  jesus! get those away from me!
nicky moore.  patty ryan.  mary finelli. these names mean anything to you, asshole?  julia sullivan!  she mean anything?  she means something to me!
got a minute?
yeah.  sure.
he am not our guy, john.
just cause he did not want to look at the photos does not mean he is not the doer. not everyone fits the profile.
he killed her john.  he killed her and i did not do a thing to stop it.
it is not your fault, dad.
yes it is...we did this.  we changed everything.  I have been having bad dreams, johnny. dreams where i die...in the fire.  i was supposed to die in that warehouse.
no.
this is wrong...it's like we cheated...
i know...  but dad, you can not go back.  you did not die in that fire.  and no matter what you do, nothing is going to change that.  so all we can do is deal with this...and try to make it right.
i do not think i can.  I am not a cop.  i can't.   i can not stop this guy.
but we can, we can do it together. spirit and guts, remember?
johnny, i know, but...
i need you to believe in me.  to believe that we can do this.
john, he is got my driver's license.
what?
he took my driver's license, john, he knows where we live.
he took your wallet?
no, he tossed the wallet, but he kept the license.
he touched your wallet!  where is your wallet?
in my pocket.
we got him!  dad you got him!
what?
his prints.  you have got his prints.  I will run them through criminal index.  you got to get me that wallet.
how the hell am i gonna do that?
listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
what...
please, dad, just do it.
okay, okay...
i got it.
right, now i need you to tape it up on the outside, where he touched it, so the prints keep.
huh?
then you got to hide it somewhere. somewhere where nobody's going to find it...for 29 years!  put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
i gotcha, i gotcha chief!
it is going to work, dad.  we are going to stop him.
hang on.
just came by to wrap up over there. thought I would say "hello."
glad you did.  come on in.  buy you a cup of coffee?
wife around?
no.  no.  well, sort of.  in my heart. been dead 29 years.
oh.  sorry.  how so?
you used to be on the job?
yeah, long time ago.  i know you?
i look familiar?
no.  what house you work?
the 2-3.  homicide.
a hot shot, huh?
nah, just working the job.
i hear that.
as a matter of fact, i caught a case that goes back to your day...one of the nightingale murders.
no kiddin'?
no.  missing teenager.  disappeared thirty years ago.  found her bones last week.  buried behind some old diner, up by dyckman street.  mary finelli.
huh.
talk about dumb luck.  odds of anybody finding that girl, thirty years later. and then the chances of hitting a dental...forget about it.  bets part is she is the first victim.  she knew the doer.  I am betting those bones are going to do a lot of talking.
who are you?
I am the train wreck you did not see coming.  and I am going to steal your life away.  you went down 30 years ago.  you just do not know it yet.
you are telling me this maniac is a cop? what the hell am i supposed to do with that one?
call the fbi.  use a pay phone.  do not give 'em your name, dad.  just tell 'em that it was shepard who killed finelli and clark and the others.  that he is the nightingale.
okay, I am on it.  hey.
hello, frank.
what are you doing here, satch?  you off today?
dad, you there?
frank, we need to talk...
john, hold on a second.  I am in the middle of something important here.  you mind if...
satch, you gotta just give me...satch is here john.  you hear me?  satch is here.
I am sorry, frank, but you need to come outside.
dad, what the hell is going on?
just a minute, john...okay?  do not go away.
what is going on here, satch?  what are those guys doing out there?
i think you know, frank.
no, i don't.
let's go outside and talk.  we need to do that.
about what?
let's go.  do us both a favor.
what do you mean?
do you know where i found this?
415 greenwich st.  #302.  under the body of a murdered woman.
no.  this is not what you think.
i wanna be wrong here.  but we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
okay, okay.  i need to go say something to julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
you can talk to julia.  forget the radio.
john, you there?
yeah, dad.  what the hell is going on?
satch is busting me for sissy clark's murder.  john...
i swear, satch.
uh, huh...  uh, huh.  and you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when i came in?
as nuts as that sounds, yes.
uh, huh.
satch, would you listen to me here.  just you and me.  can i talk to you here, alone?
frank, this is not the time to be worried about covering up if you had a thing with this girl.
he is not going to stop, satch.  he is going to keep on...
are you listening to me?  you are in a world of shit.  an eye witness has you outside the dead girl's apartment.  we got your prints all over the place.  plus the fucking driver's license, frank.  you got to give me something here. something i can believe.
what if i could prove it to you, satch?
how is that?
what if i told you that in the bottom of the 6th we are going to be down 3-0.  and cleon jones is going to get hit in the foot. it is going to leave a scuff mark on the ball.
frank, please...
the next batter, clendenon, hits one outta the park.
frank, this is insane...
in the bottom of the 7th, weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  jones and swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  the mets are gonna win 5-3.  go watch the game, satch.
go watch the game?  go watch the fucking game?  frank, they are going to make you for sissy clark's murderer.  it matches the nightingale's profile.  you understand what that means?
you got a collar in here for the nightingale murders?
yeah.
I am working with one of the victims outta brooklyn north.  you mind i take a shot at him?
that is deleon and hayes' collar.
they around?
just missed deleon.  hayes is up in the squad.
where is the collar, in the cells?
no, i think he is up in interrogation.
I will go find hayes.
hell-
you have the right to remain silent.  if you give up that right...
who the fuck is this?
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
sullivan?
you have the right to speak to an att --
fuck you, asshole.
it is a small world, carl.  and I am going to find you.  real soon.
deleon.
satch, you gotta listen to me...
frank.  we know.  we know it is shepard.
no kidding.  I am on the corner of 65th and cpw.  come get me.
you missed a hell of a game, frank.
next time lets put some money on it.
get him home safe.
hey, bud.
frank...
I am here, dad.  I am here.
we did it, john.  we stopped him.
wait.  something is wrong.  i don't...
what is wrong?
i do not remember.  why do not i remember?
