what's this, roger?
a tweeting bird?
that's right, a tweeting bird.  but what does the script say?  'rabbit gets conked.  rabbit sees <u>stars</u>!'  not birds, stars!
please, raoul.  i can give you stars, i know i can.  just drop the safe on my head one more time.
i've already dropped it on you twenty-three times.
don't worry about me.  i can take it.
i'm not worried about you.  i'm worried about the safe.
valiant, did you see the rabbit?
he was blowin' his lines, all right. so what?
so what?  he's already put me three weeks behind on the shooting schedule!
how much do you know about show business, valiant?
only there's no business like it, no business i know.
yeah, and there's no business as expensive.  i'm twenty-five grand over budget on the latest bunnysitter cartoon and it's all because that rabbit can't keep his mind on his work. and you know why?
one too many safes dropped on his head?
nah, that goes with the territory. he's a stunt bunny.
here's the problem...  "seen cooing over calamari with notsonew sugar daddy was jessica rabbit... wife of maroon star, roger".  his wife's a tramp, but he thinks she's betty crocker.  the doubt's eatin' him up.
so what do you want me to do?
get me a couple juicy pictures. somethin' i can wise the rabbit up with.
i don't work in toontown.
you don't have to.  the rabbit's wife sings at an underground toon revue joint called the ink & paint club.  you can catch her in action there.
the job's gonna cost you a hundred bucks.
a hundred bucks?  that's ridiculous.
so's the job.
i got him on loan from disney.
aren't you the lucky one...
when will i hear from you?
as soon as is humanly possible.
so, makin' dame jokes, huh, eddie? well, lemme remind ya pal, it was a <u>dame</u> who took a hundred bucks out of the till so your landlord would't throw you out of your dump.  and it was a <u>dame</u> who trusted you for the money when no one else in town would.  and it's a <u>dame</u> who's tired of waitin' for you to straighten yourself out and get a job!
would this be the same dame who's going to feel awfully foolish when she finds out i've got her money.
this is fifty bucks.  i need seventy-five before they check the books tomorrow.
you'll have it in the morning.  now be a sport and lemme have twenty bucks to put in my pocket.
is this paper even good?
check the scrawl.
r.k. maroon.
gee, it's swell to see you, eddie.  we miss you in toontown.
wish i could say the same.  what're you doin' here, betty?
work's been slow for me since the cartoons went to color.  but i still got it, eddie...  'boop boop be-doop'.
yeah, you still got it, betty.  who's mr. jocularity?
that's marvin acme, the gag king.
shoulda guessed.
he comes here every night to see jessica rabbit.
big on the musical comedy, huh?
sounds like you ve never seen her, eddie.
pattycake!  pattycake!
baker's man... but no use ruinin' a good pair of shoes over it.
well, you better start thinkin' about drinkin' it black.
frankly, i'm shocked.  marvin acme's been my friend and neighbor for thirty years.
son-of-a-bitch...  mr. maroon, i think i'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
sure, valiant, sure...
my advice?  hop on over to reno, get yourself a quickie divorce.
divorce?  never!
tell me you didn't do a snoop job for a toon named roger the rabbit.
that's what you woke me up for?
now what?
just haven't been this close to toontown for awhile.
they say the rabbit got the safe idea from a cartoon he was makin' the other day.
what a gasser.
wait here...
he's not my client.  i was workin' for r.k. maroon.
yes, we talked to mr. maroon.  he told us the rabbit became quite agitated when you showed him the pictures, and said nothing would stand in the way of him getting his wife back.  is that true?
hey, pal, do i look like a stenographer?
men?  they look more like weasles to me.
yes, i find that weasles have a special gift for the work.  the rabbit didn't contact you by any chance, did he?
why would he contact me?  i just took some lousy pictures.
so you wouldn't have any idea where he might be?
have you tried walla walla?  kokomo's very nice this time of year.
where'd this gargoyle come from anyway?
no one knows.  he bought the election a few years back.  he's been rulin' toontown ever since.
what's with the dip?
that's how he gets rid of the troublemakers.  it's a combination of acetone, turpentine and paint remover. he calls it the...  final solution.
hey, eddie, looks like you really stepped in it this time.
what are you complaining about?  here's your fifty bucks.
a new outfit bought the red car.  some big company called cloverleaf industries.
no kiddin'?  bought the red cars, huh?
bastards put him on notice.
do you think the rabbit did it?
i don't wanna think.  i wanna drink.
we don't serve formula. snookums.
you serve martinis, doncha?
yeah...
make it dry.  baby doesn't like to be wet.  you're valiant, right?  the name's baby herman.
i know who you are.  kinda out of your neighborhood, aren't you?
yeah, i had to go slummin'.  see, a friend of mine's bein' framed.
you mean the rabbit?  they got him cold.
you don't believe that.  i mean. the guy's an idiot, a moron, a complete fool...  but he'd never kill anyone. i know the guy.
oh, a ladies man, huh?
my problem is i got a fifty-year-old lust and a three-year-old dinkie.
my problem is i come here to drink in peace.  so if you don't mind...
c'mon, valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  i mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like r.k. maroon find you in the first place?
yeah, eddie, it's not like you got an ad in the yellow pages.
thanks for the vote of confidence.
and another thing, the paper said no will was found.  but every toon knows acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave toontown to the toons.
so where is it then?
somebody took it from him.  that's what this whole thing's about.
the papers said the safe door was opened, eddie.
stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, dolores?
my hunch is it was maroon.  he always was after acme's property.
yeah?  does he wear pants this color?
no.  but neither does roger.  that's diablo red.  roger's pants are sunrise orange.
well, i'll be...
so what's your next move, valiant?
so you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
he's a toon... who cares?
aah!
aah!
what the hell are you doin'?
i needed a place to hide.  i'm in trouble, eddie.
so i hear.  even talkin' to you could get me a rap for aiding and abetting.
don't worry, eddie, no one knows i'm here.
oh, yeah?  then how'd you find my house?
well, i asked the newsboy on the corner.  he didn't know.  then i asked a janitor, the fireman and finally the green grocer down the way.  he was very helpful.
in other words, the whole goddamn world knows you're here!  out!  get out!
look, pal, if you're still here when i finish this drink, i'm callin' the police.
don't do that!  i'm innocent i tell ya. the police'll just dip me.  they were waitin' for me when i got home last night.  i ran.
if you're so innocent, why'd you run?
gee, eddie, i'm a rabbit.  we always run.
eddie valiant... you're under arrest! just kidding...
you idiot.  i lost the key for those cuffs.
hey!  what do you think you're doin'?
sorry, eddie, i forgot you're not a toon.
don't ever forget that.
jesus, eddie, is this who i think it is?
dolores, meet roger rabbit.
he's a riot.
oh, yeah?  well, you're not handcuffed to him.  anybody in the back room?
it's all yours.
so you decided to help him after all?
i oughta have my head examined.  will you hold still?
does this help?
yeah, that's better.
you mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  only when it was funny.
are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
my philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
yeah... well you just might get your wish.
can you get him out of it, eddie?
if i can find whoever wanted to kill acme bad enough to get this.
yeah.  i think maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
i resent that innuendo!  my wife is completely innocent.
your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
so what's the scam, eddie?
maybe baby herman was right.  somebody wants acme's property.  cack the old man, pin it on roger, and destroy the will.
the habeus corpus is thickening.
yeah.  except they screwed up.  i don't think they got the will.
how do you know that?
well, acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  it was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
then why'd they bother to crack the safe?  you can drop a mosler 90 from mount baldy and it won't open.
well, mr. smarty-pants detective, your logic is specious.  what prevented mr. acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
because he's not forty feet tall.  the safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
eddie, you still got it.  hey, tomorrow maybe i'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around acme's estate?
yeah, do that.  i'm gonna go rattle maroon's cage.
hi, mr. maroon.  remember me?
valiant?  what're you doin' here?
i just thought i'd drop by and show you a photograph.
i've already seen your photographs.
yeah, but i enlarged this one.  thought you might be interested.
being caught breaking and entering is not very good advertising for a detective.  what were you looking for, mr. valiant?
ask her...
last week some heavy breather wanted one of my nylons as a souvenir.  maybe that's what he was after?
look, doll, if i wanted underwear, i woulda broken into frederick's of hollywood.  i was lookin' for marvin acme's will.
marvin acme had no will.  i should know, the probate is in my court.
he had a will, all right.  she took it off acme the night she and r.k. maroon knocked him off.  then she set up her loving husband to take the fall.
they must've taken it off me.
they?
the other people who were in here lookin' for the will.  i woulda caught 'em if cheetah here hadn't interrupted me.
take it easy, bongo.  we'll handle mr. valiant our own way... downtown.
downtown?  fine.  get a hold of santino, i'd be more than glad to talk to him.
oh, not <u>that</u> downtown.  <u>toon</u>town.
you're not takin' me to downtown <u>toon</u>town?
indeed we are.  we'll continue the interrogation there.
i ain't tellin' you nothin'!  get me santino.
you're a very stubborn man, mr. valiant.  very pig-headed.  boys, show mr. valiant how we handle pig-headed men at the toontown station...
here's one for the books... a toon wearin' human clothes.
earl... it's me, valiant.
eddie?  jesus, what happened?
toon cops worked me over.
boy, i'll say.  they gave you a real toon-a-roo.
what am i, earl?
you're a pig... a happy-go-lucky pig.
no...
does it hurt?
not much.  it's hard to talk.
uh, eddie, do me a favor.  could you sit in the back so you won't cause as much of a commotion.
hello, mr. valiant.  i rang the doorbell, but i guess you couldn't hear it.
that's because i don't have a doorbell.
oh... well, i... i just had to see you.
okay, you've seen me.  now give me a towel.
come on, lady, haven't you ever seen a mole before?
toons aren't given imperfections.
no?  i guess we're not counting lying, stealing and murder.
you've got the wrong idea about me. i'a a pawn in this just like poor roger.  can you help me find him?  i'll pay you anything.
yeah, i'll bet you would.  you gotta have the rabbit to make the scam work.
no, no, no... i love my husband.
oh, sure.  i can just feature you standin' outside your little hutch, holdin' a carrot cake waitin' for hubby to come home.
oh, please don't make fun of me, mr, valiant.  you don't know how hard it is being a woman looking the way i do.
yeah, well, you don't know how hard it is bein' a man looking at a woman looking the way you do.
i'm not bad, i'm just drawn that way.
i'm not complainin'.  but give me credit.  i'm the guy who took the pictures of you and acme playin' pattycake, remember?
so altruistic.
it's the truth.  why won't you believe it?
cause i don't take acme dumb pills.  i don't know what you're up to, lady, but i'm gonna nail you for the acme murder.
if i'm as bad as you think, what's stopping me from just killing you right now?
what was <u>that</u>?
<u>that</u> was the rabbit's wife.
the rabbit's wife?  wanna tell me what she was doin' with her arms around you?
probably lookin' for a good place to stick a knife.
i just stopped by to tell you that i checked out the acme probate.
maroon, right?
nope.  it's that cloverleaf outfit again.
what the hell would they want with a gag factory?
got me.  but unless the will shows up by friday midnight, it's theirs.
what's that comin' from the bar?
sounds like singin'.
oh, no...
hey, don't i get an encore?
why, you crazy toon... i've been out there riskin' my neck for you.   i come back here and you're singin' and dancin'.
but that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
and when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  that guy angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
angelo?  he's a pal, a chum...
an arsonist and a kidnapper.  he just got outta prison.
well... i still don't think he'd turn me in.
just because you got 'em to laugh?
a laugh can be a powerful thing, eddie. sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
i think i prefer the smith and wesson variety.
i've met some cynical and miserable humans in my time.  but you, edward valiant, are positively funereal!
well, right now it's gonna be your funereal.
i don't think it's gonna matter. sorry, pal, i tried.
yes, and for that you're charged with aiding and abetting.  but we'll let santino handle that.
hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
a blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? just kidding.
i think you want a drink.  how about it, judge?
well, why not?  i'm feeling magnanimous tonight.  the successful conclusion of this case draws the curtain on my career as a jurist. i'm retiring to take a new role in the private sector.
yeah?  well, don't expect the toons to give you a gold watch.
here you go, kid... say hi to casper for me.
but, eddie, you know what happens when...
drink it, jerk.  all of it.
oh, eddie, that was quick thinkin'. nothin' like usin' the old noggin, the noodle, the grey matter...
if i'm so smart, how come i'm runnin' from the law with a toon?
valiant and valiant?  who's the other valiant?
my brother.  get inside.
so what's our plan, our scenario, our modus operandi?
we can't do anything till it's dark.
say, who's this guy laughin'?
me.
gee, i didn't recognize you... i've never seen you laugh before.  that your brother makin' the rabbit ears?
what is this, twenty questions?
you damn toon!  no wonder they picked you for the patsy.  always gotta play the fool.  you make me sick!
gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
you wanna know?  well, since you're so goddamn curious, i'll tell ya.  one of you toons killed my brother.
a toon?  noooo.
yeah, a toon.  it was the guy who killed bambi's mother.
him?  oh, he was vile, heinous, despicable... a smear on the drafting board.
yeah, everybody thought so.  but me and teddy got a kick out of toons.  all toons.  we couldn't see the bad in 'em. and when this guy was accused of knockin' over the first national bank of toontown, we took his case.  but when we looked into it, we found out he did do it after all.  we went to his house to take him in.  but he was wise. he got the drop on us... literally.
safe?
piano.  guy got away, disappeared into toontown.  nobody ever saw him again.
i'll get it.
get away from there.
wrong number?
no, it's not.
i was hopin' you'd be there.  maroon's called here about four times.  he says he's gotta talk to you tonight.  he says he can help you.
i'll bet.
are you gonna call him, eddie?
what've i got to lose?  you okay, dolores?
yeah... they closed me down for a coupla weeks.
that'll work out just fine.  when this thing is over, i'll take you to catalina.  how does that sound?
familiar.  be careful, eddie.
maroon?  whaddaya want?
have you got the will?
maybe.  why?
meet me at my studio at nine o'clock. if you've got the will maybe we can stop this thing.
stop what?
gee, eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
that's why i'll be there at 8:45.
i tell you what, maybe i better come with you.
forget it.
you know, eddie, i'm not as much of a chump, and a patsy, a yokel as you think.
how much is a shave and a haircut, roger?
two bits.
i rest my case.
if i don't make it back here by ten...
yeah?
... i'd head for cucamonga.
valiant!  you surprised me.
that was the idea.
you're not too good at this, are you, r.k.?
no... i'm not.  i'm a cartoon maker, not a murderer.
well, everybody needs a hobby.
no, you gotta understand, valiant, i had nothin' to do with acme gettin' killed.  i just wanted to sell my studio.  but they wouldn't buy my property unless acme would sell his. and he wouldn't.  so i was gonna blackmail acme with pictures of him and the rabbit's wife.
you got the will in there, don't ya?
no, i don't.
you tricked me, damn you!
take it easy.
there's no time to take it easy!  you don't realize the diabolical mind we're dealing with!
what the hell are you doin' in there?
i followed you to the maroon studios. when i heard those shots, i thought i'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
you shot roger.
that's not roger.  it's one of doom's men.  he killed r.k. maroon.
lady, i guess i had you pegged wrong.
don't worry, you're not the first.  we better get out of here.
it was doom who killed acme, you know?
why didn't you tell me?
i didn't know who i could trust.
we're even.  by the way, i did find your husband.
where is he?
he's right here in the...
how did you get onto doom?
marvin told me.  doom was after his land.  ne was afraid.  that's why he brought me his will.
so where is it?
when i opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
a joker to the end.
looks like our goose is cooked, our hash is slung, our fait is accompli...
lemme guess where you got that from. tell me somethin', what'd you ever see in that guy anyway?
he made me laugh.
hold on a second.
eddie, come on.
these roads can be very treacherous at night, especially in a maniacal toon vehicle.
the pot's callin' the kettle maniacal.
i've had enough of your insolence!  put him in my car.  i think they'll enjoy attending our ribbon cutting at the acme factory.
no matter.  i don't expect the will to show up in the next fifteen minutes.  by then cloverleaf will own toontown quite legally.
so you're cloverleaf?
no one person is cloverleaf.  we're a vast company with diverse interests... gasoline, tires, automobiles.
come on, doom.  what would a company like that want with toontown?
it wasn't toontown they wanted.  it was my idea of how to put the land to better use.
don't you think anyone's gonna notice that toontown's gone?
they won't care.  who's going to miss some ridiculous talking mice when they can have the future?
right here where we're standing, will be the cornerstone of my idea... the cloverleaf -- an elegant cement structure that intertwines freeways.
what the hell's a freeway?
a freeway, mr. valiant, is eight lanes of asphalt running uninterrupted from l.a. to pasadena.  pasadena to hollywood.  hollywood to santa monica. someday everyone will be in cars driving happily, non-stop from one end of the l.a. basin to another.
that's what this is all about?  tell me, who's gonna use your lousy freeway? we got the red cars, the best public transportation in the country.
not for long.  we're retiring the red cars.  people will drive, mr. valiant, because they'll have to.  and when they drive, they'll have to buy our cars, our tires, our gasoline.
real good, rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
not before i satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
holy shit, he's a toon!
surprised?
not really.  only a toon could think of something as goofy as that freeway idea.
you?
that's right, me.
what the hell is that?
doom.
jesus christ... <u>that</u> was the judge?
that's not blood.  that's ink.  that goof acme squirted me with some the other day.  why it's comin' 'through now, i don't know.
that's because it's disappearing-reappearing ink.  shows up three days later.  gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  great gag.
yeah...
say roger, remember that love letter you wrote your wife at the ink & paint club?
yeah?
i think you oughta read it to her.
good idea.
keep reading...
hey, it's the will.  i, marvin acme, of sound mind and body, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, do hereby bequeath in perpetuity the property known as toontown to those loveable characters...
no, kid, you're a real hero.
i guess i am at that.  cigar?
by the way, roger, you were right about your wife.  she's a good lady.  i'm glad you got her back.
and i'm glad you got your sense of humor back.  think you'll keep it?
only time will tell.
pretty good cigar.  where'd you get it?
from this box here...
