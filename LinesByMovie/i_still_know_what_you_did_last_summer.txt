julie! wait! you okay?
I am fine.
you sure?
I am fine.
you do not seem fine.
the shower again?
it was in a church...it was so real. i mean, i could feel his breath on me.
I am sorry.
i thought i was over the dreams for good. i really did. i had not had one for months.
it just takes time, julie. it is going to get better.
it can not get worse. i mean, it is not like this was the first time i freaked out in class. i hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, I am this close from being thrown out of school.
it was one year ago...
it's...the anniversary. that is what is going on...take it easy on yourself.
I am trying. i really am...sometimes i do not even know why i came up here in the first place.
to get out of southport?
right. now i remember.
nah. I will probably just be here studying for finals. the joys of summer school...  are you okay?
I am okay.
are you sure?
i got in early. i was excited...  who was that guy?
oh, that is will. he is a friend. you would like him.
yeah.
ray, we are just friend.
every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
why are you being like this?
ray, i can't...
can not what?
i just feel like some part of me has not healed up enough to go back. like some critical piece is missing. please understand...
i understand something.
it is not like that. it is not you. it is me. my head. i want to go back. i want to be with you. i want to be fine. i want everything to be like it used to be.  it just isn't.
i thought you were out of town!
what are you doing in my closet?
i thought you were out of town!
what are you doing in my closet?
i just wanted your black pants, but I am not ready to die for them!
that was heart attack time, karla.
no. when i put these skinny pants on my body...now, that is heart attack time.
I am not going anywhere. I am fat, ugly, and depressed.
yeah, right -- whatever.
i think i just really hurt ray's feelings.
listen to me, julie. ray's a great guy, nothing against old ray, but he is so...ray. i mean, he lives in southport. will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
there is nothing between will and me.
yet. nothing yet.
you know what i want to do to you ...right now, do not you? there is got to be somewhere we can be alone.
i do not think so. it is pretty crowded.
just for a minute, baby. i got something i wanna tell you.
if you can say all you got to say in a minute then i do not wanna hear it.
I will talk real slow.
you are the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, jules.
tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
that is right. it is how the species survives. you will never convince me otherwise.  wanna dance?
say yes.
no.
no means yes.
tyrell, i appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? we make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
come on, I will take a break and we will all dance.
karla! did you tell him I would be here?
nope. i told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten of the clock and eleven of the clock tonight. and then he came anyway.
this was not my idea.
what?
i said, this...do you want a drink?
that could break the machine.
julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. it is a fact.
the number's unlisted...
would you relax? we have been dating three months. he am not stalking your butt.
okay, okay. you are right.
i know it, and it feels good.  hi, ty.
mark in the morning! magic 96.7! oh my god! I am karla. karla wilson.  jules, it is mark in the morning.
well, karla, what are you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
well, I am in school and --
how did you like to win a magic 96.7 quicky getaway?
yes!
still here...thinking...  you mean brazil, the country?
okay, karla, five seconds.  five...four...
rio de janeiro!
oh, no...did you say rio?
no. yes?
waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
we will call you back with all the details...so what is your favorite radio station?
hey. I am really glad you called... I am sorry.
no, you do not have to be sorry. I am the one --
no, i should not have left so fast... i was just...
it is okay.
ray, karla won a trip to the bahamas! an island called tower bay. and she wants us to come with her.
what? the bahamas? you are kidding.
we would have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  you know...
this weekend?
you will go away with you are college friends, but you will not go away with me?
idiot. idiot. idiot.
you gotta sell his butt on the bahamas?
ray, come on. i want us to be together.
julie, we are working a big run up here. it is been crazy. we probably have to go out again tonight. i do not think i can do it.
will you try...for me, please?
okay, I will try. but, listen...  if i do not make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
ray...please try. i really miss you.  okay. bye.
stupid. stupid.
stupid. what were you thinkng?
jeez, ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
i should go up there. i should call her back, tell her I am coming.
no way, man. surprise her. she will be psyched.
i do not know, man. maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
no.
the guy looks dead.
he is not coming. i thought he was just...
julie, you left four messages... four.
but, he said he would try.
he said he would try. try is like maybe. try is nothing!
he does work hard.
work hard, huh? he is breaking your heart just because he can.  and i do not want to have to say i told you so...
then, don't.
oh!
hey, sorry...  he is my friend, too. and that ticket is not going to waste.
julie, is everything cool? karla said...
i said we start having fun. and that means now.
is there a problem here?
where there is a will, there is a way. come on.
just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
what if i do not have anything happy from childhood...sorry, i can not relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  which is over seven hundred feet a second. imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
deep breaths --
fumes build up in the fuel tanks. you can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. planes use o-rings...which freeze in tap water. planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
you have got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
right. planes get hit by lightning. they get hit by meteors. they hit other planes.
something is going to hit your butt if you do not quit complaining.
honey, some folks just can not fly.
I am the king of the world.
no, I am the king of the world.
remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' i do for a weekend once every ten years.
i will, and you remind me of the same thing.
can not talk right now.
see, it is not a macho thing. it is about equilibrium in your inner ear. you could have used a patch, but it is too late now. get used to it.  some folks just can not sail.
hello? hello?
where is everyone? I will ask --
what can i do for you?
checking in...karla wilson.
it sure is a beautiful old hotel.
built in 1948 for a member of the rockefeller clan. the tile work was imported from spain. a lot of history in these walls...judy garland stayed here...hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
you are in 201 and 202.
is that bad?
not at all. those are our honeymoon suites.
your what?
honeymoon suites. i take it you kids have not exchanged vows, yet?
we have not exchanged anything.
julie, we are talkin' suites!  that will be just fine with us.
and, while you are here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
wait...did you say off-season?
july fourth weekend. storm season starts today. the clouds roll in like clockwork.
storm season?
it is our version of winter.  201 and 202. there is scrabble and parcheesi in the lobby. enjoy.
am not nothin' free in this world. everybody says it, and it is true.  i wanted you all to have a good trip.
we will, baby...all this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
and it is been blue skies all day. it might be perfect all weekend.
it beets being on the mainland.
oooh, the mainland --
somebody is gone tropical on us, baby. tropical!
guess the capital of brazil --
rio, baby!
their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
karla! you promised.
i also promised tyrell.
you sure it is okay with you?
sure. it is fine. as long as you do not snore.
you can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand.
you guys lost?
tell me this am not the bar scene.
wanna drink?
we did not get all dressed up for nothing.
planter's punch, singapore sling, or how about a mai-tai?
the last day of the season. yeah, we heard.
so why are you still here?
what is the matter, boy trouble?
not anymore.
he leave you?
no. i shot him.
am i bad? i mean, he is really great, and he is cute --
he is cute...and he is got a crush on you...  but...
i miss ray...i tried to call him.
pretty cool bar.
they all start to look the same once you have worked in one.  am i right, sister?
to a great weekend --
yeah, a great weekend. forget the weather!
karaoke -- perfect.
do not even think about it.
okay, i won't.
no way.
yes.
no.
yes.
not me...no way...
come on, it will be fun.
ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, julie james.
julie? what is wrong?
it's...him.
what do you mean, julie?
he did something to the screen...it, it, said...
oh, will! I am sorry.
it is my fault. i should not have...i did not think...
no, no, no. this was really sweet...
i scared you -- i crossed the line --
no -- it is not that. it's...i'm just a little on edge. I am really sorry.
hey, you do not have to appologize to me. I am the one. i understand.  I am going to take a walk and dry off.
are you sure? i really appreciate it.
tha's it.  I have decided.  I am changing my major to finance.  and going to wall street.
why?
'cause that is the only way I am ever going to be able to afford a big bed like this.
get lost, you scared me.
fish are all over the water...come on, let us take a boat out.
titus, you are so stoned, you would end up in spain.
that is why you will come with titus, mon.
there is a storm comin', titus. no boats are going out.
storm is what makes it interesting. thass why all the fish are up. less hook us a couple big ones.
i got work to do. take the bake elsewhere.
up-tighteous and self-righteous.
you sure you did not pick up my hair tie?
hello?
okay, i just did not wanna get my hair wet.
baby, i finally got you alone in this jacuzzi and i do not wanna be discussin' hair care.
i used to be a lifeguard...i'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
I would hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
there is ten people on this whole island and they are all going to end up in this jacuzzi with us.
how is the water?
crowded.
ahh, that feels great.
how is julie?
alone. in the room.  got any advise?
what? what are you talking about? where?
it is in my room!
there was a body! i swear it!
julie, you said you were tired. waybe you were dreaming.
i was not dreaming.
listen to me. he is here.
who? who is here?
what is going on?
julie thinks there is a dead guy in the closet.
cool.
the rest of us see bathrobes.
i am not crazy, tyrell. he was right there.
fine. show me the body.
think about this, julie. what did you actually see?
the dockhand guy. hanging by his neck from up there.
i want off this island.
not possible, I am afraid. the last ferry left hours ago. and we got a storm coming. there will not be another one for days.
then I will call the mainland for a charter.
phones went down a few minutes ago.
duh. the next couple of days is going to be rough, but we will make it.
what about a radio?
sorry. emergencies only.
what the hell would you call this?
I would call this four spoiled city kids who would not know a hurricane if it blew up their butts.  all we can do now is batten down and ride it out. if things get really bad, there is a storm shelter.
jeez, that is a full carat --
how much?
well, there is some flaws in her...
how much?
do not really have the market for something like this...  i can go two...two-fifty.
make it three hundred. and throw that in, too.
hell, that is worth three, easy. and you got your waiting period.
I am not waiting...so give me the gun and keep the ring.
you get any sleep at all?
some.
oh, look. another day in paradise with julie-your-tour-director...miss psychotic episode.
hey --
see any dead bodies out there? any fresh kill? how 'bout freddy, jason?
I am just saying what all of you are thinking. it is bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
you do not have to be a jerk.
it is okay...he does not believe me. that is his right. I am starting to think I am crazy, too.
hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...what do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
nice move.
I will be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
where is everybody?
they are all dead...dead, i tell you.  ahhhh, we are all deaaaddddd. tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
they are around...they just do not care about us 'cause we are the contest winners.  let's go find stoner boy...make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or ping-pong paddles or something.
you know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
hey -- shut up, okay?
cancer in a box.
no, this is the safe sun.  it is better than a day at the beach.
karla!
just kidding.
take this.
and do what with it?
I am not crazy...i'm not crazy. he is here...  we have got to get to the radio and call for help.
i think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
we gotta get out of here. now.
they were cut loose.
julie? wanna tell us what is going on here?
we are all going to die. he is going to kill us one by one.
who?
ben willis.
oh, stop it! he is dead. you killed him. now, get over it. we got to think here.
they never found the body.
julie...
only he was not dead. he killed barry and helen last july fourth.
the porter...what's his name? old asbestos --
estes! that is exactly who it is. that old guy knows something. we can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
voodoo.
i told you.
we will only be a second, okay?
yeah, wait right here, it is the safest place.
let him go. i believe him.
come on, julie. you saw his room.
what do you mean?
rio is not the capital of brazil. it was the wrong answer. sorry, we lose.
you have got all these theories but where is he? where? where is your fisherman killer?
i do not know.
you never do...the guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. little notes that only mean something to you. how do we even know you are not the one behind this --
i know i do not want to stay in here.
we will be better off in the open. if we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
be careful, julie.
I have got to see.
julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. there is no way off this place.
then, we fight --
where did estes go?
what is up with that weirdo?
I will go find him.
why? he can not help us.
he is probably the only one who can help us.
I will come with you.
are you crazy? we are not staying here on our own.
maybe we should just wait here? hide in a tree?
I am not hiding up no tree.  I am with her. let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
I am your best friend...you could have told me the truth about what happened. i would have understood.
karla, i just wanted the whole thing to be over. i did not want to involve anybody else.
it is too late for that.
you think that is a good place to hide?
i do not know, but I am starving.
do not kill me --
wait, it is nancy --
I am sorry, but you could have been the one doing all of this --
and so could you -- crazy fool.
you stumbled into my hiding place.
must have missed the sign.
excuse me, but this island did not have a murder rate until you people showed up.  I have never seen a dead body before.
there is no way to lock it.
what do we do?
i do not know...
come on, you can make it.
julie?
I am right here. grab my hand.
I am holding your hand!
no, you are not.
...nancy?
come on. we are going to be okay.
did you get help?
estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
he is in it with willis?
i guess so.
why are you doing this to me?
me, me, me. it is always about you. I am having bad dreams. i can not sleep. I am not doing well in school. I am having trouble with my boyfriend.
i trusted you.
we had a connection, did not we? i can tell you one thing, though. ray did not trust me. he was right. he is dead, but he was right.
...why?
why? come on, julie. think. you will get it. will benson -- ben's son.
oh, god, it is you --
you are okay. thank god.
is he?
ray...what are you doing?
oh...it's not working right. you are home early.  did i scare you?
never do that again.
hey -- i did not know you were here. it is okay.  we got the refrigerator in. come see.
i love it here.
it is going to be great.
checking the locks again?
you know me to well.
