how is she doing?
she wants to lay down.  I am a little worried.
well, i brung her something i know she likes.
damn, fred, you can not give away all those.
forget it.  i got vegetables coming out my ears.  usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately i am not so much as seen a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.
if that am not the truth.  and i count on them for a little bit of stew meat...thank you, fred.
we playing cards tonight?
i think I am going to be sitting up with her.
I would do the same.  well, catch you thursday.
you bet.
you did not cook breakfast?
did it yesterday.  franks and beans.
no...it was eggs.  i did eggs.
hell you did.  your turn.
how many cows does it take to make a stampede?  is it like three or more?  is there a minimum speed?
i was in one.  a bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree.  three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.  was not so damn funny, i can  tell you.
if there was one nearby I would probably ask him.
i keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...
handymen, earl.  we are handymen.
whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.
goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.
has a lot of rain.
you are going to get us hung up.
do not talk to the driver.
uh...digging that waterhole for nestor.
burt and heather's place is closer. let's do their kitchen today.  do nestor tomorrow.
nestor's out of town tomorrow.  we do not dig today.  we do not get paid today.  damn it, valentine, you never plan ahead.  you never take the long view.  hell, here it is monday and I am already working on wednesday.  it is monday, right?
who the hell's that?  that is not what is his name...the grad student?
nah, it is september.  must be the new one.
the new one!  that is supposed to be a girl!
hi, I am rhonda.  rhonda lebeck. I am up here for the semester...
yeah, geography.
right, geology.  and you have to be val and earl.  I have heard all about you.
listen, got a question for you.  do you know if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?
around here?  why would they?
well, I am supposed monitor these seismographs.  you know, they measure vibrations...
yeah, vibrations in the ground.
yeah, well, I am getting what i refer to scientifically as "weird vibes."  every sensor I have got is giving me strange readings.  i mean, the school has had these machines up here three years and they have never recorded anything like this.
well, we will ask around.  let you know if we hear of anything.
thanks.  god, i hope they are not screwed up.  i might have to bag the whole semester. anyway, sorry to bother you.
no problem.  nice meeting you. hope you get it sorted out.
you know, if you wanted, we could take a look at those seismographs for her.
what the hell do we know about seismographs?
nothing.  but it sure might be a nice way of getting to know her.
why?
goddamnit, valentine, you will not go for any gal unless she fits that damn list of yours a to z...
well, sure.
...and is dumber than my hind end. like that bobby lynn dexter...
tammy lynn baxter.
do not matter.  they are all the same: dead weight.  can not make a decision, can not walk because of their shoes, can not work because of their fingernails.  make my skin crawl!
well, I am a victim of circumstance.
i thought you called it your pecker.  look, do not make the mistake i made.  twenty years of looking for a woman exactly like miss october 1968, and where did it get me?  here with you.
hi, guys, what you been up to?
ran into the new college student, rona.
rhonda.  rhonda lebeck.  she is getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the feds will be at our door.  "sorry, time to move. eminent domain."
down, honey, down.
yeah, burt.  the way you worry, you are going to have a heart attack before you get to survive world war iii.
hey val, listen.  bearing going out, you think?
could be.
catch it later, pham.  got to get over to nestor's.
right.  we plan ahead.  that way we do not do anything right now.  earl explained it to me.
a beauty, is not it?  we bought three of them for the rec room.
we sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
and i appreciate it.
you do not get it, pham.  the idea was: we were ripping you off.
why do not his parents ever take him to vegas with them?
you gotta ask that?
so what if we just did it...today. pack up.  drive straight down to bixby.  get serious.
we could.  we could.  but we would have to get really serious.  it is going to cost twice as much to rent a place.
so?  that car wash pays good, and they are always looking.
car wash?!  that is got no future. if we are going to take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.
yeah, sure.  go ahead and plan it...for a year or two.
well, you're the one will not work in the car wash.  you are the one's got to have a plan.
damn it, val!  not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
what keeps us doing jobs like this is you dragging your feet.  i was up for going to bixby.  i was getting excited.
in the past year i must have said a hundred times "we got to get out of perfection.  we got to better ourselves."  you going to stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I am the reason we are still here?  you want to know how close i am to going to bixby right now?
I will call that little bluff.  how close?
uh oh, it is nancy.  she wants another load of firewood.
forget it, man.  it is not worth it.
she is got us.  now, listen, the plan is: we have done our last job in perfection.
that is the plan.
we did it!  we faced temptation and we did not bend!
damn straight!  now there is nothing between us and bixby but nothing!
so long, cactus!
adios, bridge!
jeez, look at that guy.
one job I would never take is working around electricity.
especially when it is two hundred feet off the ground.
you are full of shit.
he is only got one damn jacket. that is him, I am telling you.
reckon he hated perfection more than us?  you suppose he wanted to kill himself?
if he did, why did not he use his damn shotgun?
maybe he just could not pull the trigger...
oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of thirst?  come on, sombody must have chased him up there.
oh, you mean somebody who am not scared of a twelve gauge shotgun. and then what did they do?  camp out down below and just wait for him to die?
well, whatever the hell happened it is just one more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.
you got that right.
probably up a pole starving itself to death.
okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the whole way.  we do not stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.
I will go with that plan.
oh, jesus!!
what the hell is going on?  i mean what the hell is going on?!!
i do not believe this.  the phone is out!  pham, your phone is out!
i did not do it!  what is going on?
brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
well, there is sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  everybody we know between here and bixby is already dead.
those assholes are supposed to be fixing the goddamn road!  hey!  where are you guys?  people gotta use this road, you know! you on a booze break or what?!
val!  val!
jesus!  i do not believe this!
you are hung up again.
i am not!
fuck you!
hey, i do not want spend the night out here!
what the hell you doing back already?
you are never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it is completely...
or a big mother slug maybe?
some kind of mutation...?
it must have grabbed us.  that is why the truck stalled-out.
yeah!  next time i tell you I am not hung up...!
twenty.
okay, ten dollars.
slick as snot and I am not lying.
fifteen lousy bucks.
a man who plans ahead.
miguel, the trouble's come to us. if we are not ready...
phone's out.  road's out.  we are on our own.
I am dead.  let's finish in the morning.
we have to go into bixby in the morning.  the concrete blocks are in.
the con...!  oh my god.
just keep looking at that beautiful sky.
what?
that is the sky that is going to be over our roof every night, when we are done.
ah, but consider this, if we do not finish the roof, we can looks at that sky all the time.
well, what is wrong with it?
it's...gone...!
you sure this is where it was?
am i sure?!  it was right there.  there is the cord.
come on.  get away from it!
god, what a stink!
pham, we do not want to be stuck on a couple of canners.  they better be fast.
relax.  a snake thing like that could not move too quick.
screw you.  for all you know they could fly.
you want the rifle or the smith?
the rifle.
you guys all set?
ready as we will ever be.
heather and i are going to drive around a little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass back into town.
you stupid punk!  you came that close, that close!!
one of these days, melvin, somebody is going to kick your ass.
that means we are going to be out here, like, in the dark.
great.  thank you.
car's gone.  we just missed them, that is all.
then where is the goddamn conway twitty coming from?
here's the plan...we do not even stop.  ride like hell.  tonight we keep right on going.  we will walk the horses.
that is the plan...i mean, goddamn it!  what the hell are those things?  how could they bury an entire plymouth station wagon?
why would they do it?
shut up!  they got wind of something they do not like!
oh shit!
what the hell are they?
sons of bitches!
jesus christ...think it smells like that 'cause it is dead?
i do not see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...
i think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in.  good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.
yeah, I am lucky it did not find me.  this is important, you know.  this is like, well, let's say it, it is probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century.  the century?  forget it.  history.
this is one big mother!
so this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?
hey, rhonda, you ever heard of anything like this before?
sure, earl, everybody knows about them.  we just did not tell you. come on, nobody's ever seen one of these!  we are really in on something here!
pham van do not get his mitts on this for no measly fifteen bucks!
you got that right!
here's the plan: we will get a...a flatbed, i guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
naw, do not want to winch it.  that would tear it all up.  want to lift it. some kind of crane with lifting straps.
we will take your word for it.
yeah.  where is your truck?
prairie dog burrow...
little sons of bitches.
well, at least the bastard can not climb.  pardon my french.
probably could not move too easily on the surface.
god, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.
okay, now, how far's your truck?
i do not know.  if this one's any faster than that other one...
i think we wait right here.
there is nothing like them in the fossil record, I am sure...okay, so they predate the fossil record...  that would make them a couple of billion years old...and we have just never seen one till now.  right.
I would vote for outer space.  no way those are local boys.
well...haven't seen a sign for hours.  maybe it is long gone.
maybe it is.  why do not you take a little stroll and see?
fuck you, too.  pardon my french.
son of a bitch!
son of a goddamned bitch!  been waiting there all this time.  how the hell's it even know we are still here?
it is been listening to us.  it is got no eyes.  it sure as hell can not smell anything underground, so i figure...
you know, i hate to be crude, but I am going to have to take care of some business here.
me, too.
darn it!
you okay?
yeah.  but I will tell you, if you ever wanted proof god is a man, this is it.
well, folks, what is the plan?
first let's see if stumpy's still out there.
do not he have a home to go to?
well, that is why edgar never got down off that tower.
i might have an idea...
we are going to have to come up with some kind of plan or it is just going to wait us to death.
well, i was wondering if we could...
run for it?  running's not a plan. running is what you do when the plan fails.  you are not even trying to come up with a plan!
well, it is not like we have got a hell of a lot of options...
think it is still following us?
let's assume that it is.
ready?
yeah.  one, two, three...
you go north, I will go south.
right.
I will bet you are sorry the college ever sent you up here.
well, I am scared, but I am not sorry.
you know, val went to that college, too.  for a whole year.  could not quite sit still for it, though. had too much vinegar in his system. but once he settles down, forgets this cowboy stuff, he will be one in a million.
you are right, do not matter where they come from.
right.  we need to be talking about what we are going to do.
rhonda's got an idea about that.
yes, see, they move very easily through the pleistocene alluvials...  ...the dirt...the loose soil that makes up the valley floor.  but they can not move through solid rock. i think we should travel west to the mountains.
you know, up the jeep trail.
the mountains are solid granite. we would be safe there, and we could hike along them...all the way to bixby if we have to.
I am going to kick his ass!
I am going to help you.
you paying attention?  this oughta hurt like hell.
it does.
I have got a plan.  you and val take your truck, get to the mountains. hike to bixby.  get us some help.
those scumsuckers are my radials, pham!
well, we can take my truck then.
no good.  you need major four- wheel-drive just to get up that jeep trail.
shut it up!  shut the little bastard up!
chuck him out the door!  like a little hors d'oeuvre.
oh my god.
son of a bitchin' lowlife, putrid, scum...
i can not believe it.  no tracks, no sign, no spoor.
yeah, whatever they are, you would think after they ate all those sheep they would have to take a dump someplace...  what the hell's going on in town?
how the hell long it take you to change a tire?
just about too damn long.  bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
we need another plan.
negative copy on that, pham, check your frequency.  I am on forty-nine.
burt, can you hear me now?
just barely, pham.  what are you all doing up on your roofs. what the hell's going on?  come back.
burt!  this is val!  get out of your basement!!  take your radio! you and heather get up on your roof!  then we will talk, okay?!
val?  what the hell you doing back already?
burt, get out!  get up on your roof or someplace!  we found out what is been killing people!  they are under the ground!
what is under the ground?  we are not getting up on the roof.  earth shelter's the best.  known that since i was a kid.
listen!  listen!  we know what they are!  they are big things under the ground!  much bigger than we thought!  they are coming after you! they are coming right now!
you are not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun.
damn!  val, we can not get them.  never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  best goddamn bullet stop there is.  come back.
okay, burt, listen.  forget shooting them.  tell me this: can you get to your truck?
no problem.
good.  you have got the only truck in the valley that can make it up that damn jeep trail.  so, here's the plan: you and heather go for help. get to the mountains...
what is it doing?
why do you all keep asking me?
yeah, they are confused.  they can feel our vibrations, but they can not find us.
they are working together, too.
yeah, like they got a plan...
breaker there, earl.  what do you want us to do?
hang on, burt.  the bastards are up to something.
burt!  heather!
yeah, val.
we are in deep shit over here. let's change that plan.
knock it off, burt!
i think i scared it!
we are here, val.  just tell us what you need.  come back.
they are tearing down the houses here!  we all got to get outta here together!  now!
val, we are going to have to forget about the truck...
yeah, heather, we got you.
what?!!  since when the hell's every goddamn thing up to us?!
you guys do all the odd jobs.
look, the situation has not changed. we still have to get to solid rock. there must be some way!
like what?!  there is nothing left that will make it to the mountains!
wait a minute...the cat.  could we take the cat?
jesus.  it is slower than hell.
yeah, but it weighs better than thirty tons.  no way they could stop it.
but...we could pull something!  we could, i do not know, drag a car behind it!
a car, huh?  like a big armored car?  need something bigger, tougher...our truck maybe...or, hell, that old semi trailer!
its tires are flat...
does not matter.  the cat can pull anything.
well...all right!  we just roll on out of here!
we got a plan!
listen, they only respond to vibration, right?  could not we... distract them somehow?
yeah, good!  something to keep them busy.  we need a decoy.
i think the ground's getting closer.  i think we do it.  we are going to save our asses here!
wait!  how are you going to know they are all following it?
good point.
yeah, still got one poking around.
that is four.  let us know if it starts moving, burt.
roger that.
i'm making the run to the cat.
like hell you are.
get real.  I am faster than you.
i'm best at driving the cat.
only if something happens to me.
watch your ass, shithead.
do not worry about me, jerkoff.
he will never make it!  they are going to get him!
val, stop!  they are coming!  do not move!
let's go you two.  we are headed for the mountains.
in a minute.
that is fine.  we have got some new things to teach them.
damn it!  they will sink this rig just like a boat!
jesus christ, we are only going nine miles.  be there in two hours, tops!
yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
what do you think?  max firepower or...?
I would go for penetration.  the 458 shooting solids -- less ammo to carry anyway.
we are not going over there, right?
no.  we go straight.
damn it.  what the hell are they doing?  they are up to something.
i do not care what they are doing as long as they are doing it way over there.
come on, everybody!  we gotta run for those rocks over there!
jesus, val, it is pretty far.
she is got my vote.
right.  we are going to run.  get ready.
it worked!  there they go!
let's do it!
so...now what?
could we make it to the mountains?
well...that's it.  we are not getting off this rock...
not going to pole vault anywhere. that is for sure.
what?  well, for chrissake, we could have made a stand at our place!  we had food, water...
you can not fight'em that way...
you two jackasses hauled us way the hell out here...!?
back off, burt...!
well, who put you two in charge?
how much you think?
i do not know...  they are pretty quick...fifteen seconds?
what the hell is that, anyway?
cannon fuse.
what do you use it for?
my cannon.
come on, you are not going to do your lasso thing...?
hey, just 'cause you are no good with a rope...
where the hell are they?  hope they did not wise up.
nope, there!  that is one.
they're...they're trying to make us move!
or just knock us over.  look, use the bomb!
it is out last one.  we can not kill them all.
use the fucking bomb!
so, we get back on that rock and in three days we are dead anyway.
i want to live for the three days.
what the hell are you doing?!!
i got a goddamn plan!!
light it, man!  light it!!
not yet, not yet...
road's in!
road's in!  now, soon as we hit bixby we start making phone calls. we could make some real money off this whole thing, get in people magazine...
people?  hell, national geographic.
sell the movie rights.  we are going straight from blue-collar to white -collar.
yeah...but no ties.
no ties.
hi, guys.  burt loaned me his camera.
howdy, rhonda.
you are really leaving, huh?
you bet.  you gonna be staying up here?
well, yeah!  there is going to be major research up here.  first thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug up.
christ, val, maybe she is not your type, but you could, at least, be civil.
civil?  I am civil.
you are not civil, you are glum.  we got the world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum on me.
somebody paying you to do this?
she just practically asked you for a date.  what the hell is wrong?!
fine, make the mistakes i did. i think I will just be playing this hand myself.
what?
she likes both of us.  we both helped her out.
you are so full of shit...
oh yeah?  think about this:  she am not as narrow-minded as you. I will lay odds she is looking for character in a man.  for my part, I would be proud to have her.  I would goddamn worship her.
