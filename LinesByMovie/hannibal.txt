s'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning.
you nervous...?
evone tells me:  i shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
gonna be fine.  you ask your momma.
....i didn't realize i said it out loud.
said what?
i'm an orphan.
well, then, you're a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...i've got an appointment....
waal...
it gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
what'd you say, hon...?
i said sometime it gets so...
well, don't you worry, cause that <u>baby's</u> gone take care of <u>that</u>.
waited too long, hon...?
how's your <u>child</u>?
i said how's your baby...?
you want to <u>hold</u> him...?
waal...
'bout time you <u>learned</u>...
give it up, evelda.
well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>i</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
give it up.
hey, you know, i never thought of that...
and you let her get away.
sir, with all due respect....
just a moment.  starling didn't...
well, well, well, well, well, she went <u>in</u> there, to apprehend a dangerous felon. went in there with her gun, came out, <u>without</u> the felon, with<u>out</u> the gun...
i had... one moment, i had an <u>agent</u> in there, waiting for <u>backup</u> from...
...she couldn't act on her own..?  where is the fbi's vaunted initiative, where..?
sir:
shut up, starling...
i could have acted on my own.  i was told...
starling, i've ordered you to shut...
..i was <u>instructed</u> that this was a joint task force, the fbi, batf, and the mayor's special...
you find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
sir, i'm in law enforcement, i was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
you were given backup....
then where was it?  i'm sent out there... i'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
i'm saying: ... and what's wrong with that.
and i'm telling you:  you wanna throw a birthday party:  every kid gets a chance to play, that's <u>fine</u>, but...
no, i don't get you...
due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious joint operation.  fbi, atf, dc swat, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same radio freqs, we don't...
oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to joint...
i'm opposed to being part, your rainbow coalition.  evelda drumgo?  i could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>but</u>-- i'm out there, and my rules of engagement...
i don't mind being the token <u>woman</u>, what i'm suggesting, send me out there with a token <u>man</u>... who are these warriors, our cobbled together strike force?  i'm in the room with a fugitive felon...
starling...?
one moment, and they're at the <u>seven-</u> <u>eleven</u>.  they botched the fallback plan, they...
and, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
sir, i was, as instructed, waiting for the arrival of the strike force. {pause)
i think that's... {he starts to rise, and the meeting begins to break up) starling, i'm sure these gentlemen...
and how did she get close enough to disarm you?
...spend some time on the streets.  ask me then...
thank you, that's not responsive.  how did our miss drumgo get...
she threw a punch at a man on the team.
well, you know, that happens, on the street.
what is that supposed to mean...?
i think its meaning is clear.
what, you're saying she was overwrought.
that could be.
because that's understandable, because. she blew the raid.
she was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  and...
one moment, i'm not done with you...  give him the file...
your girl's a menace.  here, givver <u>this</u>... getter off the street and teach her some <u>humility</u>.
i don't <u>think</u> so...
well, then, you have insufficient information.  i'm grateful for this opportunity to set you straight.
why would you say that?  because he sent me in there to be killed...?  what <u>is</u> this...?
...what's he got against you?
he once made me an improper suggestion.
tell me why...?
i'm sorry, i don't mean to be impolite. because, you know, you can't understand.
then tell me.
well, you know, you know, you know, the <u>point</u> is:  i <u>can't</u> tell you.  cause you haven't <u>been</u> there.  you haven't <u>done it</u>. and that's all there <u>is</u>.
...and to have <u>done</u> it, means, can mean to accept, not only <u>danger</u>, but <u>betrayal</u>...?
....that's right.
..and <u>humiliation</u>?  what is this new job they've...?
no.  that's right.  that's all part of it.
then, that being so, why is today special?  why have you come back to see me?  is it that new file they gave you?
i don't <u>think</u> so.
then what brings you back?
i don't know.  do <u>you</u> know...?
yes.  i think i <u>do</u>.  i think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  you told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  you <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
...no...
...you called up memories of your <u>father</u> to...
...no...
...<u>barter</u> with her.  to appeal to her, and you feel that...
no, i don't <u>think</u> so...
it is <u>you</u> who have betrayed...
...no.
your father.  it is not <u>they</u>, who...
well, no...  that's... i appreciate your <u>help</u>, but...
you want another drink, honey...?
i want the <u>same</u> drink.  cause it did me <u>good</u>... but i already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, i would like another.
what's that, baby?
alcohol.  where both its life-enhancing and its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some hindu <u>god</u>...
i guess the only thing is suck it up...
well.  <u>excellent</u>... i'm...
our mister <u>frendler</u> to, to, to humiliate me, though....
what else's he goin to do with his day, he can't work, and he won't steal...
oh baby, oh baby....
bad beat today.
hey, i'm fine.  whaddizit, you, how's your day, our gallant international neighbors...?
look what they put her on...
no, that is code-word material, that's what <u>that</u> is....
evelda drumgo.
could i get a <u>drink</u>,  n'i don't <u>care</u>, you see, what all they got me doin, for i'd rather be doin' <u>makework</u>, than be doin' <u>pub'l'relations</u> with the dirty dozen, one <u>hispanic</u>, one <u>librarian</u>, one <u>jew</u>, and one from column a, and one from column...  thank you.
an honor.  carlo pazzi....
no, y'know, i never <u>doubted</u> it...
you were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
well, that's you see, what i am, kind and feeling.
you should get married.
that's what i should do.  tell me why?
because, baby, you're looking to find love in an institution, that's your only chance....
yeah, but who would marry friendless <u>me</u>...  howabout you, romeo...?
...<u>sadly</u>...
hey, lost again.
but perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
i'm sure there is, but my young friend here, would <u>kill</u> you.
his feelings do him honor.  and i have come, simply, to pay my <u>respects</u> to the great clarice starling...
the great and <u>beautiful</u>...
is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
no,i get it, this is my <u>cavalier</u>.  this gents my italian knight.  take <u>this</u>...  for this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
thank you.
or clear your windshield with it.
...what a lovely perfume.
waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in alexandria virginia, n'that's where i'm going, cause i'm goin <u>home</u>, f'i can get n'y'one, of that nature, to <u>take</u> her there...
c'mon, pal.
all y'got to do is <u>ask</u>...
...this one is my favorite.  it has not title.  they should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...?
i know it well.
<u>do</u> you.  what does that mean?
it is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native florence.
yeah, i'm sure it's famed for lotsa things, and you're one'a'them...
...but:  this particular statue...
waal, you hold fast to that thought, as i'm sure, that's a "clue"...
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, i would like to say, it is an honor to meet the woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated hannibal lechter...
i din't solve it, i didn't '<u>solve it</u>'.  i just sat a <u>dance</u> out with him.  facts, facts, facts.  <u>facts</u>, close the case, cavalier.
...a case, so, so <u>fascinating</u>, so...
yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a <u>cannibal</u>...
show'm the fbi <u>hand</u>shake...
i am no going to show you the <u>secret</u> <u>handshake</u>!
yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
...not to turn around.
you want to get married...?
you tol me you wuunt ask me again til i'm ready....
you're ready now.
i'm not.
that's what <u>you</u> think...
then you tell me, then.
you want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
i feel...  i feel they're out to <u>get</u> me...
and who is "they?"
...they're sending me.  out to get shot.  hounding me.... they're...
...the whole world's out to get you...
how crazy is that.
well, you wanna shoot <u>back</u>, it give you a big <u>target</u>...
how <u>crazy</u> is that....
agent starling, would you come with me...?
the children...?
...they're from baltimore....
i've never heard that he...
it's not something he wants to publicize, ma'am.  it's just something he does.
i won't take much of his time.
he's glad to help.  ...it's just a question of his physical condition.  you understand...
for the <u>worst</u> hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.
i've come to see you, sir, about an auction...
ah, yes, ah yes.  our doctor lechter... and have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  how terrible for you...
no, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
because we must leave the past <u>in</u> the past.    ah.  and here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with him...
sir, various drawings, done by dr. lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  i have to ask if you've placed those bids.
because?
because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was dr. lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
and why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  and because you have large resources.
large resources, starling, which i prefer to devote elsewhere....
my encounter.
<u>someone</u> offered three million dollars bounty on dr. lechter's head.
the identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
yes, but we know who it was, and i will tell you, agent starling, what you know to be true.  i offered the bounty.  it was illegal, and, worse, it was <u>wrong</u>. and i thank god every day that i did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  do you  agent starling:  do you know <u>god</u>?
...sir...?
isn't it funny?  you can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what i hope is a long life. you can look at me.  which shows  a strength which <u>must</u> come from strong  strong convictions.   but you <u>shy</u> when i say the name of god.
yes, then, you're saying that you <u>haven't</u> bid upon these drawings.
i have not, i would <u>not</u>.  for life  life goes on starling.  and, wait, wait, i wish to <u>talk</u> to you... i'm...    one moment.  i was <u>afflicted</u>, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your dr. lechter.  i was <u>afflicted</u> before. before.  do you see?  in my arrogance. do not  do not curse god when you are humiliated.  listen to me: <u>embrace</u> it, and you embrace <u>life</u>.... <u>listen</u>, and you hear the word of <u>god</u>...
what would <u>that</u> be?
he... would consider it a favor if he could make a <u>donation</u>.  to a charitable institution of your choice.
now, why in the world would he do that?
i... think... he was.... he was <u>touched</u>, by your reaction.  to his appearance.
what reaction?
exactly.
please, i do not... i don't want to <u>trouble</u> him.  but if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying dr. lechter's...
do you know the <u>seller</u>?
we've subpoenaed the auction house's records.
try barney clark.
he is...?
he was the orderly, during dr. lechter's stay in prison.
and how would you know that?
before "the change," mr. verger was... he made quite a study.
you should get the kids a <u>dog</u>...
....i hardly <u>think</u> so... after "the incident"...
no, no, of course not.
...mr. verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
tell him to give it to an orphanage.
yes.
what does <u>that</u> mean?
i saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who'll spend his life in a hospital bbb...
yes, so you said.  but what does that mean:  to go beyond the institution.
if <u>he</u> could overcome... his need for... for self-<u>ratification</u>...
...would you use a small word?
for approval.
what's wrong with approval?  you admired that man.
yes.
how do you think that made him feel?  what does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?"
i told that woman i'm an orphan.
...you <u>are</u> an orphan.
but... but....but.... you're <u>right</u>.  i used it.  to <u>bargain</u>.  for her <u>sympathy</u>...  i <u>used</u> it--to "whore myself out"--
welcome to the human race.  do you know, there are people who admire you?  reasonable people.  why don't you <u>find</u> them...?
look at this:
you seen john brigham...?
this just came in, over the transom. fella, works for a plastic surgeon, argentina.  look here:
...what'm i looking at...?
a fellow with five fingers.
...standard issue...
not for our doctor lechter.  this...  purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. left hand.  it purports to be the x-ray of dr. l...
am i on that case, sir...?
no.
well, then--i wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
hard up as you are, at your age?  whadda <u>you</u> care?  surrender.
~don't shoot, g-men..."
how was america?
bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
...nightmare.
what's up...?
doctore carlo fanelli, curator of the pallazo capponi, 2 months missing.
yeah, so where is he?
somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for information, so on.
they got that kind of money?
their family owns...
what else did i miss...?
atrocious torture.  hit of the season, you want, i know a guy can get you a ticket.
...are they hard to get?
impossible.
...what a world.
aren't you glad to see me?
tell me about your trip... what did you <u>bring</u> me...?
i can't think.
...you don't have to think.
we have to talk about <u>money</u>...
i'm on the track of a reward, which...
a reward...
i'm going to tell you later....
a reward for what?
some museum director disappeared.
and?
they're offering...
...you haven't <u>found</u> him yet.
<u>what</u> is this, a whorehouse, or are you my <u>wife</u>?
you've gone off to america, on your <u>vacation</u>...
...i was <u>working</u>...
...<u>please</u>...
i <u>swear</u> to you...
...and i want to talk to you about your <u>promotion</u>..
yes?  my <u>promotion</u>...?
i want to talk to you about your <u>salary</u>. because i can't...
hold up a minute...
you spend the afternoon in bed?
first things first.
you take this much time over everything?
that's why my wife adores me.
what're they on about?
they're grilling the applicant for the vacant post.
speaking of the vacant post.
dottore fanelli...
...a dr. fell.  a brazilian, i think. applying for fanelli's post.
brazilian.
it would seem.
who, can you think, who would want to harm dr. fanelli, did he have any <u>enemies</u>, that...
...i have never met a man who was so well beloved.
...he was <u>wealthy</u>...
he had nothing.  he lived in a garret. his work was his life, he...
...his family has offered a large reward.
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  <u>no</u> one.  no one has but lost by it...
...would you excuse me...?
of course, commendatore...
could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, dottore fanelli...?
i never met him.  i knew him only from his writings.
i know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a <u>note</u>, a farewell note, a suicide note...
...yes.
you have taken over his offices, is that not so?
it is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
of course, <u>in</u> his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... are his personal effects still at the palazzo?
yes.  packed and with an inventory.
i'll have them picked up.
if your duty requires it.
you have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
and you have a new wedding ring on yours? <u>la vita nuova</u>?--
you looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. is it hard?  must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
why did you look at me that way?
i saw a man in disheveled clothing, but <u>clean</u>.  just dressed--in the middle of the...
i saw a man, somewhat <u>fatigued</u>. quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled.  in the middle of the day.  an old story.  and then i saw the clothing was <u>fresh</u>--therefore:  a man who dressed at <u>home</u>.  and then i remarked the new <u>wedding</u> ring.  and so:  the <u>story</u> gave me pause.  a lovely story.  a new, and a beloved <u>wife</u>.  i wish you joy.
you assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
i'm a historian.  it is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
...your <u>scar</u>..?
my scar is a war-wound.
how so?
carpal-tunnel syndrome.  from a life of typing.  commendatore.  <u>history</u>, a hazardous profession.
yes.  how did you know?
you resemble a figure from the della robia rondels, in your family's chapel at santa croce.
it was adresa de pazzi, depicted as john the baptist.  you have seen the chapel?
i have had the honor.
and?  then?
i wonder no longer.  you were out of the country.
how could you know?
i <u>sense</u>...  the faintest <u>whiff</u> of a perfume, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u>, whose <u>base</u> is "hamamelis" ... it is <u>witch-hazel</u>--such a clean scent.  no, not a european scent. i would say it is a scent of the new world.  i would say, you have been in america.  have i struck home?
you know america?
...you have <u>brought</u> this perfume... brought this perfume.  back.  <u>back</u> from america.  to your new wife...  you have given it to her, and some of...  some of 'her perfume' has found its way back onto you.  lucky man.  lucky man, indeed.
you know why that is?  because there are so few things i need to forget. would you agree, for the record, that i have not been read my rights?
i have not read you your rights.
would you mind saying that into your bag...?
i hereby acknowledge that...
and now i have "dociled" you, have i not?  by forcing your obedience.
then why did you chose to <u>inform</u> me of it...?
to <u>show</u>...  in my ability to <u>squander</u>.  what one might deem an <u>advantage</u>... that my <u>strength</u> is greater than <u>yours</u>...
oh yeah?  wanna arm wrestle...?
if you'll come down the street i will make you a cup of coffee.
well.  word gets around.
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
it wasn't my day.
perhaps you did not have the <u>support</u> you required.
it's a poor workman who blames his tools.
or, perhaps...
...how are things at the hospital?
it's a growth business.
what have they got you doing?
orderly.
i would have figured you an r.n. by now, or, maybe med school.
i prefer to stay in the less frivolous professions.
you lasted eight years, as orderly, in dr. lechter's prison ward.
yes, i presumed it was about him.
...you...
i'm struck by your phraseology.  i did not <u>last</u> with him.  i was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
i'm looking for...
he said, and these were his words, he <u>valued</u> our time together, because i was civil.
did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
he told me, he preferred to eat the rude. or:  "natural composting."  do you think he'd come after <u>you</u>...?
i asked you how you like your coffee...? we have black and bitter.  as the soul of man.  or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.
we got a bunch of <u>materials</u>, coming up at auction.  materials which disappeared from dr. lechter's cell, drawings he made, his <u>books</u>.
yes?
and i'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
why me?
waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... two years ago, his annotated dictionary of cuisine, by alexander dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. seller's affidavit of ownership, signed cary panz.  p.a.n.z.  sounds to me like an orderly.  whadja clear on the book? ten, twelve grand?
...very good.
here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
...why?
let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
you said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  why?
now, whyn't you help us?
that would adversely impact my income.
not as much as being jailed for theft of government property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
we could skip the gavotte.
say it in english.
lechter's not buying up his memorabilia. he keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
then who's buying it?
there's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>pass</u>," i'll rat them out to you...
<u>that's</u> the spirit...
...aren't you afraid of me...?
you want me to be?
i'd prefer it...  but it's just a vacant exercise.
you said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do."  aren't you part of them anymore...?  aren't you part of the fbi? 'no girl's allowed,' or <u>what</u>?  have you transgressed...?
let's keep it to business, shall we?
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
...they did it for a lark.
oh, good.  the ornithological leitmotif...
<u>who</u> are these guys...?
rich, comic book freaks.
and why is it a vacant exercise?
because we both know who's buying the lechteriana.
who would that be.
mason verger.  for he cannot be free. dr. lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  can <u>you</u> be free....?
no, you're wrong about verger.
oh, yes.  he's found peace.
well, if he hasn't, i'm vastly mistaken.
and have <u>you</u> found peace..?
how you doin?
m'i gonna see you tonight?
that's right.
then i'm doing fine.
what's new onna street?
all quiet along the potomac...
yes sir, i saw it.
we have a memo here, from your friend mr. krendler at the justice department.
i am all attention.
he requests your presence, once again, as part of...
because you're going to help me plan a party.
you're going to <u>do</u> that?
i'm going to do it, and you're going to catch the bouquet.
the multi-jurisdiction task force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, evelda drumgo.  the man's hazing you.
my daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
i'll tell you what:  i should go in there, volunteer to fill up his female quota.
mr. crawford asked my opinion.  here we've got a purported x-ray, dr. lechter's surgery.  do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
saying what, "look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
yeah, that's too hip for the room.
you stay offa this alphabet soup detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
i don't wanna go out there at <u>all</u>...
what do you want to do?  you want to jam up that sonofabitch krendler.
no.  i want to buy a dog.
what broke <u>you</u> free, girl?
i met a man, and his troubles were greater than mine...
...franklin.
where do you live?
with mama and shirley and stringbean.
in and out.  yes.  and mama... and mama, is not your real mama, is she franklin?
she my foster.
she's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>is</u> she?
no.
do you like it at your home, franklin?
we got kittykat...
yes.... yes...
...and shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
yes.  franklin, you can't live there anymore.  with mama and shirly and kittykat.  you have to go away.
...who say...?
the government says.  mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother.  the police found a marijuana cigarette in your home.  you can't see mama anymore.  or shirley.  or kitty cat.  that's what the <u>government</u> says...
can we identify it as dr. lechter?
not with any certainty we...
why did he come back?
our operatives in brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
...why did he come back?  why did the boy turn back...?
...are you alright, sir...?
he turned back into the room.  where have we seen it before.
seen what, sir..?
the puppy comes back.  if you lie on the ground.  the puppy with return.  why? do you know why...?  to kill you.  it thinks you have fallen and are powerless. it comes back to tear your throat. that's why the child turned back.  as lechter will return back.  you see?  to the sight of his oppressor <u>wounded</u>. he will return to savage our beloved miss starling.  bring me a drink.
...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are <u>expensive</u>...
they aren't expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
fine, thank you, but
speaking of which, i want you also to get us tickets for the opera...
...whatever is within my <u>power</u>...
...and that is what you need to expand.
i don't understand.
we are here on sufferance.  i am here...
...why are we here in the <u>first</u> place...?
because it is exclusive... because <u>everyone</u> will be here...
...my love...
...they asked us to dinner.  how can we accept if we cannot <u>return</u> the...
i am on the track of...
yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>...
...what do you expect me to...
darling, dr. fell.  my wife madame pazzi.
enchante.
sadly, no.  and i find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. what do you think?
and how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in torture?
dr. fell is studying for his examination by the studiolo.
indeed i am.  and the connection, between dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, i could show you...
my husband brought it to me from america.
a wonderful country...
you know it?
i have had many excellent meals there.
and yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
...should love to correct your error.
well, perhaps sometime we...
darling...
well, if you will excuse me.  madame. what a pleasure.
the commissioner is going round the cafe...
no.  invite us?  no, he simply...
then we cannot go.
because...?
because we cannot <u>pay</u>...
"because we don't have any money."
....because we don't have any mmm...
the case that i am <u>working</u> on...
it's a <u>joke</u>.  you're a joke.  you're a joke.  you don't know what money <u>is</u>-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  that is the fine limit of your ambitions...
what was it.  what was it, honey?
...something about my <u>father</u>...?
...what?
do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause i'm going to work.
<u>do</u> it...
...let's see the pigs, please.
make them eat the figurine.
they <u>will</u>, sir.  we <u>train</u> them, to the figurine, <u>eventually</u>, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
...tell them...
...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the <u>man</u>... i keep them hungry.  when... when do we think this man arrives.
is it necessary to know?
well, i don't want to starve them too long.  they die.
oh, no, no.  it won't be <u>that</u> long.
yes, but no one is in control of their emotions.  that's all we have time for today...
i don't understand.
you said:  that you have "decided." that your... your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a "self- indulgence," and you are going to put them aside.  and get on with your job.
that's right.
and you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the lechter case.
yes.
and you've decided to get <u>married</u>.  you've decided a <u>lot</u> of things.  but, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  <u>despair</u>, of <u>failure</u> of... you still have the <u>nightmare</u>, you...
what is your point?
that if <u>decision</u> were a useful tool, you wouldn't <u>be</u> here.  why are you here...?
i..
...yes...?
i want to do something <u>positive</u>...
you want some <u>advice</u>.
yes.
your life has been defined by institutions.  the orphanage where you were raised, the fbi academy, the bureau.  if the institution is your life, <u>accept</u> it.  ask to be reinstated on the "drumgo" task force.  play their game.
...why?
because it's the game you've chosen. that's really all we have time for.
...a <u>liaison</u> position...
and what does <u>that</u> mean?
...i feel that...
"a liaison position with the opera."
she must be something special after dark.
i can't remember.  i've got to make some money.
thirty thousand dollars reward.  in the whereabouts of il dottore fanelli, or the apprehension of his...
...yes, yes, yes....
hello....?
...what did you want?
i know where he is.
i'm sure i don't know who you mean.
i know where he is.
and why should we believe you?
i know something no one knows.  he has had his finger removed.  on his left hand.  it left a scar.
what shape is the scar?
i want the money.
what shape is the scar?
the shape of a three.
where was the call from.
somewhere in italy.
make plans for lechter's abduction.
...then we won't need to tether miss starling as our lure.
that operation has begun.  are we god, that we would <u>meddle</u> with it...?  <u>no</u>, on the <u>other</u> hand...
brigham.  go.  affirmative.  okay, happiness is a green light.  we've got evelda in the kitchen, cooking.  the dope's d.e.a.  <u>we</u> want her on interstate transportation of some firecrackers.  starling:  you've got drumgo, you know her from before.
i know her by the back.
...these guy'll back you up.
what, what, i can't hear you...
are you <u>alright</u>...?
i almost shot the <u>baby</u>...
who called the <u>tv crews</u>...?
...sir...?
waal, nobody's <u>perfect</u>... what do we hear from our songbird in switzerland?
ask me when we get home.
oh, my <u>program</u>...
who does not?
if such there breathe, i'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  your reputation does you honor.
i've left my <u>program</u>...
take mine.  ah. and is that your <u>wife</u>...  signora.  can it be that you are lovelier, even, than at our last encounter...?
my mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
then, she, <u>herself</u>, possessed some knowledge of the greater world...how pleased am i to see you looking so well...
...long overdue.
back to <u>america</u>...?   when first we met you'd just returned from america.
how wonderful of you, to hold that information in your <u>busy</u> mind...
...how so?
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the <u>studiolo</u>...
and how good of <u>you</u> to remember it. then, this trip, then, is not a return to <u>america</u>...
no, this is <u>pleasure</u>...
and what was the trip <u>before</u>...?
that, that was <u>business</u>...
...and then, we're going to <u>greece</u>...
yes, but the <u>important</u> thing, as i've said...
...get me a cigarette.
i came to pay my...
...get outta my way, you sonofa<u>bitch</u>...
i realize, you're under a lot of....
you put my friend in the ground, with your mickeymouse <u>taskforce</u>...  izsat the kind of headlines that preserve and promote, you, sir?
if you would see him monument, look around you.
show me the pigs.
i'm not a scholar, dottore.  but it seemed as if they, as if they...
yes, i think i amused them.  to what do i owe...?
i require...
...yes, yes, yes...
i'd like to walk home with you, and...
yes, of course, and we'll <u>collect</u> them. i won't be a minute...
he escaped...

what do you want me to do?
follow starling, stake out starling. increase the pressure on starling.  he will come to her.
i know you did what you could.
i'm going to work for your reinstatement...
reinstatement to <u>what</u>?  there ain't nobody there...
...what...?
n'not <u>that</u> sad.
no.
every suicide kills two.
yeah.  well.  they're a talkative buncha commentators.
you got a lot of people love you, starling.
trouble is, they all seem to <u>die</u>.
y'want to gimme brigham's pistol?
what would you guess, ardelia?
you goin to shoot yourself?
don't shoot yourself.
why?
cause i'm tired, cleaning up after you.  why dontcha gimme the gun?
he was <u>shot</u>...he was shot.  on his rounds.  and... and...
that's when you went to the orphanage...
and all he <u>left</u> us:  the country brought back his <u>hat</u>, and his <u>badge</u>... both with a bullethole in them.  an' that's what he left us.  that's what i said.
and you have been <u>dreaming</u>... dreaming about this hat, and...
and.  i always said, he was a <u>p'lice</u> officer.
...yes...?
but.  he was a night <u>watchman</u>.  that's what he was.  n'they brought back, his hat, his <u>badge</u>, an his <u>timeclock</u>.  n'then they took me off.  i <u>saw</u>... i saw.  clear as day, do you, do they call it a <u>delusion</u>?  his hat an his badge.  clear as day, bulletholes and all.
when?
but they were not there.  <u>yesterday</u>.  is that called a delusion...?
...thank you...  and how are you this evening, doctor? no, we know that you're awake...
good evening, dr. lechter.  thank you for coming.  i am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
thank you, cordell.
...but will that satisfy you?
why should <u>you</u> care?
it is not that i care for <u>you</u>--but that i posses an enquiring mind.  what will you <u>do</u> when i am gone?  when you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
are you <u>done</u>?
<u>yes</u>.
you don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
explain in depth the plan we have for him.  until tomorrow.
no, i think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
...young boys, still...?
...here's to child abuse!
mmm...
...and then, he'll be coming down.
you said the <u>bad</u> news...
yes, i did.
i believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
oh, yes, what?  you'd <u>bribe</u> me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
i can make you rich.
and i expect you to.  let's talk like two medical men
come on, stay with us.  look here:  i could get behind you, and give you a <u>spinal</u>, tomorrow, you wuunt feel <u>anything</u> down there, a l'il <u>pulling</u> is all.  n'i'll tell you <u>what</u>, after he's got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, i'll come down here, give you a shotta <u>this</u>  stop your heart, an that's <u>you</u> done, an there's an <u>end</u> to it.  what do you say...?  i know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  i know how that stuff works, take it out, move it <u>around</u>...  ...stay with me now, <u>fuss</u> with it... whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a <u>code</u>... move that money to me, he <u>confirms</u> it, and i fix you up right now...  whatsay?
..suitcase...locker...
come on, doctor, <u>then</u> you can sleep...
...unmarked hundreds....
....what...?
..it won't be long now, sir...
ohforgodsake, get on with it.
can you walk?  are your legs working...?
<u>perhaps</u>... shall we <u>see</u>...?
i'm going to cut you loose.  with all due respect, doctor, if you fuck with me, i'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  do right and you'll live through this.
spoken like a protestant.
the girl could use some help.
you're <u>free</u>...
...which of us is free...?
yes, to cease to hope is the greatest crime.  the greatest crime.  perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>i</u> never ceased to hope!
the girl needs help.
and what would be of greater help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  don't you think?  in which the innocent are tortured in ways which would make the anguish of the damned seem tame and unimaginative, don't you <u>think</u>?  blind him again, and prepare <u>him and her</u> for the pigs!
...might i make a suggestion...?
...after you' re dead.  and when i give the word, do you understand...when i give the <u>word</u>...
...fraid, that's about it, doctor.
let the girl go.
why?
for a consideration.
'fraid it's too late.
...when i...
...what has she done to harm you...?
he don't like popcorn.
no.  and...
i like popcorn...
...yes, if you'll, just step <u>away</u>...
you give me whatever i want...?
yes.  you know i will.  that's right.
awright.
you look lovely.
thank you.  no, i know you'd prefer "i'm glad you <u>find</u> me so..."
i'd prefer you to say what you feel.
what is that that smells so wonderful.
i hope you'll <u>find</u> it so.  yes.  it's <u>good</u> to see you regaining your strength...
thanks to <u>you</u>...
...i'm sorry....?
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
indeed we were.
...and my need for the institution...
freud, do you know...?  freud psychoanalyzed patients in one afternoon.
and how did he do that?
he saw the truth, and <u>spoke</u> it...
i'm afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
...you have to <u>eat</u>...
...may be the heat....
let's get her <u>out</u> of here....
give me your gun...
...<u>what</u>...?
