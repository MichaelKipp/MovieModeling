s'hotter inside than it is outside...even with the air conditioning.
you nervous...?
evone tells me:  i shoulda been in, fi, six, months ago.... thizz my first checkup.
gonna be fine.  you ask your momma.
....i did not realize i said it out loud.
said what?
I am an orphan.
well, then, you are a lucky girl, cause that baby's gone to be your family.  ...i've got an appointment....
waal...
it gets, um... it gets so lonely sometime.
what did you say, hon...?
i said sometime it gets so...
well, do not you worry, cause that baby's gone take care of that.
waited too long, hon...?
how is your child?
i said how is your baby...?
you want to hold him...?
waal...
'bout time you learned...
give it up, evelda.
well, you know my name, honey, but <i>i</i> do not know yours...
give it up.
hey, you know, i never thought of that...
and you let her get away.
sir, with all due respect....
just a moment.  starling didn't...
well, well, well, well, well, she went in there, to apprehend a dangerous felon. went in there with her gun, came out, without the felon, without the gun...
i had... one moment, i had an agent in there, waiting for backup from...
...she could not act on her own..?  where is the fbi's vaunted initiative, where..?
sir:
shut up, starling...
i could have acted on my own.  i was told...
starling, I have ordered you to shut...
..i was instructed that this was a joint task force, the fbi, batf, and the mayor's special...
you find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
sir, I am in law enforcement, i was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
you were given backup....
then where was it?  I am sent out there... I am told that the arrest must be a joint...
I am saying: ... and what is wrong with that.
and I am telling you:  you wanna throw a birthday party:  every kid gets a chance to play, that is fine, but...
no, i do not get you...
due respect, you don't, sir, your precious joint operation.  fbi, atf, dc swat, it is alphabet soup, we do not have the same radio freqs, we don't...
oh, is this your political position, you are opposed to joint...
I am opposed to being part, your rainbow coalition.  evelda drumgo?  i could of took her down in a snap of the fingers-- but-- I am out there, and my rules of engagement...
i do not mind being the token woman, what I am suggesting, send me out there with a token man... who are these warriors, our cobbled together strike force?  I am in the room with a fugitive felon...
starling...?
one moment, and they are at the seven- eleven.  they botched the fallback plan, they...
and, fine, alright, and fine... what are youdoing, this whole time?
sir, i was, as instructed, waiting for the arrival of the strike force. {pause)
i think that's... {he starts to rise, and the meeting begins to break up) starling, I am sure these gentlemen...
and how did she get close enough to disarm you?
...spend some time on the streets.  ask me then...
thank you, that is not responsive.  how did our miss drumgo get...
she threw a punch at a man on the team.
well, you know, that happens, on the street.
what is that supposed to mean...?
i think its meaning is clear.
what, you are saying she was overwrought.
that could be.
because that is understandable, because. she blew the raid.
she was there, alone, sir, she was in a burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.  and...
one moment, I am not done with you...  give him the file...
your girl's a menace.  here, givver this... getter off the street and teach her some humility.
i do not think so...
well, then, you have insufficient information.  I am grateful for this opportunity to set you straight.
why would you say that?  because he sent me in there to be killed...?  what is this...?
...what's he got against you?
he once made me an improper suggestion.
tell me why...?
I am sorry, i do not mean to be impolite. because, you know, you can not understand.
then tell me.
well, you know, you know, you know, the point is:  i can't tell you.  cause you have not been there.  you have not done it. and that is all there is.
...and to have done it, means, can mean to accept, not only danger, but betrayal...?
....that's right.
..and humiliation?  what is this new job they've...?
no.  that is right.  that is all part of it.
then, that being so, why is today special?  why have you come back to see me?  is it that new file they gave you?
i do not think so.
then what brings you back?
i do not know.  do you know...?
yes.  i think i do.  i think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  you told her you were an orphan.  you used, to your mind, your most private fears.
...no...
...you called up memories of your father to...
...no...
...barter with her.  to appeal to her, and you feel that...
no, i do not think so...
it is you who have betrayed...
...no.
your father.  it is not they, who...
well, no...  that's... i appreciate your help, but...
you want another drink, honey...?
i want the same drink.  cause it did me good... but i already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, i would like another.
what is that, baby?
alcohol.  where both its life-enhancing and its life destroying qualities...  ...not unlike some hindu god...
i guess the only thing is suck it up...
well.  excellent... i'm...
our mister frendler to, to, to humiliate me, though....
what else's he goin to do with his day, he can not work, and he will not steal...
oh baby, oh baby....
bad beat today.
hey, I am fine.  whaddizit, you, how is your day, our gallant international neighbors...?
look what they put her on...
no, that is code-word material, that is what that is....
evelda drumgo.
could i get a drink,  n'i do not care, you see, what all they got me doin, for I would rather be doin' makework, than be doin' pub'l'relations with the dirty dozen, one hispanic, one librarian, one jew, and one from column a, and one from column...  thank you.
an honor.  carlo pazzi....
no, y'know, i never doubted it...
you were kind enough, today, to take my photograph.
well, that is you see, what i am, kind and feeling.
you should get married.
that is what i should do.  tell me why?
because, baby, you are looking to find love in an institution, that is your only chance....
yeah, but who would marry friendless me...  howabout you, romeo...?
...sadly...
hey, lost again.
but perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
I am sure there is, but my young friend here, would kill you.
his feelings do him honor.  and i have come, simply, to pay my respects to the great clarice starling...
the great and beautiful...
is it necessary to say of the sea that it is salt, that the stars are far, that...
no,i get it, this is my cavalier.  this gents my italian knight.  take this...  for this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.
thank you.
or clear your windshield with it.
...what a lovely perfume.
waal, you c'n only get it in one shop in alexandria virginia, n'that's where I am going, cause I am goin home, f'i can get n'y'one, of that nature, to take her there...
c'mon, pal.
all y'got to do is ask...
...this one is my favorite.  it has not title.  they should call it "fetch," whaddaya think...?
i know it well.
do you.  what does that mean?
it is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______ in my native florence.
yeah, I am sure it is famed for lotsa things, and you are one'a'them...
...but:  this particular statue...
waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I am sure, that is a "clue"...
....this is perhaps an inappropriate time... but, i would like to say, it is an honor to meet the woman who solved the celebrated hannibal lechter...
i din't solve it, i did not 'solve it'.  i just sat a dance out with him.  facts, facts, facts.  facts, close the case, cavalier.
...a case, so, so fascinating, so...
yeah, well, they solved that:  turns out, he'uz a cannibal...
show'm the fbi handshake...
i am no going to show you the secret handshake!
yeah, well, it is a raw wound, innit, you are going to bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the trick is...?
...not to turn around.
you want to get married...?
you tol me you wuunt ask me again til I am ready....
you are ready now.
I am not.
that is what you think...
then you tell me, then.
you want me to solve all your problems tonight...?
i feel...  i feel they are out to get me...
and who is "they?"
...they're sending me.  out to get shot.  hounding me.... they're...
...the whole world's out to get you...
how crazy is that.
well, you wanna shoot back, it give you a big target...
how crazy is that....
agent starling, would you come with me...?
the children...?
...they're from baltimore....
I have never heard that he...
it is not something he wants to publicize, ma'am.  it is just something he does.
i will not take much of his time.
he is glad to help.  ...it's just a question of his physical condition.  you understand...
for the worst hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.
I have come to see you, sir, about an auction...
ah, yes, ah yes.  our doctor lechter... and have they sent you, once again to capture him?  how terrible for you...
no, sir, it is not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
because we must leave the past in the past.    ah.  and here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with him...
sir, various drawings, done by dr. lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction.  several large reserve bids have been placed on them.  i have to ask if you have placed those bids.
because?
because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was dr. lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
and why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived.  and because you have large resources.
large resources, starling, which i prefer to devote elsewhere....
my encounter.
someone offered three million dollars bounty on dr. lechter's head.
the identity of the person offering the bounty was never established.
yes, but we know who it was, and i will tell you, agent starling, what you know to be true.  i offered the bounty.  it was illegal, and, worse, it was wrong. and i thank god every day that i did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder.  do you  agent starling:  do you know god?
...sir...?
is not it funny?  you can look on my face  which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what i hope is a long life. you can look at me.  which shows  a strength which must come from strong  strong convictions.   but you shy when i say the name of god.
yes, then, you are saying that you haven't bid upon these drawings.
i have not, i would not.  for life  life goes on starling.  and, wait, wait, i wish to talk to you... i'm...    one moment.  i was afflicted, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your dr. lechter.  i was afflicted before. before.  do you see?  in my arrogance. do not  do not curse god when you are humiliated.  listen to me: embrace it, and you embrace life.... listen, and you hear the word of god...
what would that be?
he... would consider it a favor if he could make a donation.  to a charitable institution of your choice.
now, why in the world would he do that?
i... think... he was.... he was touched, by your reaction.  to his appearance.
what reaction?
exactly.
please, i do not... i do not want to trouble him.  but if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying dr. lechter's...
do you know the seller?
we have subpoenaed the auction house's records.
try barney clark.
he is...?
he was the orderly, during dr. lechter's stay in prison.
and how would you know that?
before "the change," mr. verger was... he made quite a study.
you should get the kids a dog...
....i hardly think so... after "the incident"...
no, no, of course not.
...mr. verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable...
tell him to give it to an orphanage.
yes.
what does that mean?
i saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who will spend his life in a hospital bbb...
yes, so you said.  but what does that mean:  to go beyond the institution.
if he could overcome... his need for... for self-ratification...
...would you use a small word?
for approval.
what is wrong with approval?  you admired that man.
yes.
how do you think that made him feel?  what does that mean, "to go beyond the institution...?"
i told that woman I am an orphan.
...you are an orphan.
but... but....but.... you are right.  i used it.  to bargain.  for her sympathy...  i used it--to "whore myself out"--
welcome to the human race.  do you know, there are people who admire you?  reasonable people.  why do not you find them...?
look at this:
you seen john brigham...?
this just came in, over the transom. fella, works for a plastic surgeon, argentina.  look here:
...what'm i looking at...?
a fellow with five fingers.
...standard issue...
not for our doctor lechter.  this...  purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a ...white male...mmmm....mmmm...., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. left hand.  it purports to be the x-ray of dr. l...
am i on that case, sir...?
no.
well, then--i would not want to be taken for a hobbyist...
hard up as you are, at your age?  whadda you care?  surrender.
~don't shoot, g-men..."
how was america?
bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.
...nightmare.
what is up...?
doctore carlo fanelli, curator of the pallazo capponi, 2 months missing.
yeah, so where is he?
somewhere where his family are offering a thirty grand reward for information, so on.
they got that kind of money?
their family owns...
what else did i miss...?
atrocious torture.  hit of the season, you want, i know a guy can get you a ticket.
...are they hard to get?
impossible.
...what a world.
are not you glad to see me?
tell me about your trip... what did you bring me...?
i can not think.
...you do not have to think.
we have to talk about money...
I am on the track of a reward, which...
a reward...
I am going to tell you later....
a reward for what?
some museum director disappeared.
and?
they are offering...
...you have not found him yet.
what is this, a whorehouse, or are you my wife?
you have gone off to america, on your vacation...
...i was working...
...please...
i swear to you...
...and i want to talk to you about your promotion..
yes?  my promotion...?
i want to talk to you about your salary. because i can't...
hold up a minute...
you spend the afternoon in bed?
first things first.
you take this much time over everything?
that is why my wife adores me.
what are they on about?
they are grilling the applicant for the vacant post.
speaking of the vacant post.
dottore fanelli...
...a dr. fell.  a brazilian, i think. applying for fanelli's post.
brazilian.
it would seem.
who, can you think, who would want to harm dr. fanelli, did he have any enemies, that...
...i have never met a man who was so well beloved.
...he was wealthy...
he had nothing.  he lived in a garret. his work was his life, he...
...his family has offered a large reward.
..who would benefit from his disappearance?  no one.  no one has but lost by it...
...would you excuse me...?
of course, commendatore...
could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, dottore fanelli...?
i never met him.  i knew him only from his writings.
i know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a note, a farewell note, a suicide note...
...yes.
you have taken over his offices, is that not so?
it is only temporary, until my confirmation by...
of course, in his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... are his personal effects still at the palazzo?
yes.  packed and with an inventory.
I will have them picked up.
if your duty requires it.
you have a recent scar on the back of your hand.
and you have a new wedding ring on yours? la vita nuova?--
you looked oddly at me, back on the landing.
yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. is it hard?  must one, then, be constantly suspicious?
why did you look at me that way?
i saw a man in disheveled clothing, but clean.  just dressed--in the middle of the...
i saw a man, somewhat fatigued. quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled.  in the middle of the day.  an old story.  and then i saw the clothing was fresh--therefore:  a man who dressed at home.  and then i remarked the new wedding ring.  and so:  the story gave me pause.  a lovely story.  a new, and a beloved wife.  i wish you joy.
you assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations?
I am a historian.  it is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious.
...your scar..?
my scar is a war-wound.
how so?
carpal-tunnel syndrome.  from a life of typing.  commendatore.  history, a hazardous profession.
yes.  how did you know?
you resemble a figure from the della robia rondels, in your family's chapel at santa croce.
it was adresa de pazzi, depicted as john the baptist.  you have seen the chapel?
i have had the honor.
and?  then?
i wonder no longer.  you were out of the country.
how could you know?
i sense...  the faintest whiff of a perfume, whose base, whose base, whose base is "hamamelis" ... it is witch-hazel--such a clean scent.  no, not a european scent. i would say it is a scent of the new world.  i would say, you have been in america.  have i struck home?
you know america?
...you have brought this perfume... brought this perfume.  back.  back from america.  to your new wife...  you have given it to her, and some of...  some of 'her perfume' has found its way back onto you.  lucky man.  lucky man, indeed.
you know why that is?  because there are so few things i need to forget. would you agree, for the record, that i have not been read my rights?
i have not read you your rights.
would you mind saying that into your bag...?
i hereby acknowledge that...
and now i have "dociled" you, have i not?  by forcing your obedience.
then why did you chose to inform me of it...?
to show...  in my ability to squander.  what one might deem an advantage... that my strength is greater than yours...
oh yeah?  wanna arm wrestle...?
if you will come down the street i will make you a cup of coffee.
well.  word gets around.
...what hindered you...?
it was not my day.
perhaps you did not have the support you required.
it is a poor workman who blames his tools.
or, perhaps...
...how are things at the hospital?
it is a growth business.
what have they got you doing?
orderly.
i would have figured you an r.n. by now, or, maybe med school.
i prefer to stay in the less frivolous professions.
you lasted eight years, as orderly, in dr. lechter's prison ward.
yes, i presumed it was about him.
...you...
I am struck by your phraseology.  i did not last with him.  i was privileged to enjoy his company during that time.
I am looking for...
he said, and these were his words, he valued our time together, because i was civil.
did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you?
he told me, he preferred to eat the rude. or:  "natural composting."  do you think he would come after you...?
i asked you how you like your coffee...? we have black and bitter.  as the soul of man.  or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive.
we got a bunch of materials, coming up at auction.  materials which disappeared from dr. lechter's cell, drawings he made, his books.
yes?
and I would like your help, determining who is bidding for their purchase.
why me?
waal, because your selling'em... two years ago, his annotated dictionary of cuisine, by alexander dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. seller's affidavit of ownership, signed cary panz.  p.a.n.z.  sounds to me like an orderly.  whadja clear on the book? ten, twelve grand?
...very good.
here's what they want you to do:  we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.
...why?
let's just say they got a passion for collectibles...
you said "here's what they want you to do..."  why?
now, whyn't you help us?
that would adversely impact my income.
not as much as being jailed for theft of government property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
we could skip the gavotte.
say it in english.
lechter's not buying up his memorabilia. he keeps it all in his "mind," do you see...?
then who is buying it?
there is one or two freaks, and, for a "pass," I will rat them out to you...
that's the spirit...
...aren't you afraid of me...?
you want me to be?
I would prefer it...  but it is just a vacant exercise.
you said "here's what they want you to do."  are not you part of them anymore...?  are not you part of the fbi? 'no girl's allowed,' or what?  have you transgressed...?
let's keep it to business, shall we?
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
...they did it for a lark.
oh, good.  the ornithological leitmotif...
who are these guys...?
rich, comic book freaks.
and why is it a vacant exercise?
because we both know who is buying the lechteriana.
who would that be.
mason verger.  for he cannot be free. dr. lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice.  can you be free....?
no, you are wrong about verger.
oh, yes.  he is found peace.
well, if he hasn't, I am vastly mistaken.
and have you found peace..?
how you doin?
m'i going to see you tonight?
that is right.
then I am doing fine.
what is new onna street?
all quiet along the potomac...
yes sir, i saw it.
we have a memo here, from your friend mr. krendler at the justice department.
i am all attention.
he requests your presence, once again, as part of...
because you are going to help me plan a party.
you are going to do that?
I am going to do it, and you are going to catch the bouquet.
the multi-jurisdiction task force:  read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, evelda drumgo.  the man's hazing you.
my daddy would say:  accept with glee the things you cannot change.
I will tell you what:  i should go in there, volunteer to fill up his female quota.
mr. crawford asked my opinion.  here we have got a purported x-ray, dr. lechter's surgery.  do we keep it secret, or broadcast it?
saying what, "look out for a guy with ten fingers...?"
yeah, that is too hip for the room.
you stay offa this alphabet soup detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your mind cleared.... you do not wanna go out there a half-step slow...
i do not wanna go out there at all...
what do you want to do?  you want to jam up that sonofabitch krendler.
no.  i want to buy a dog.
what broke you free, girl?
i met a man, and his troubles were greater than mine...
...franklin.
where do you live?
with mama and shirley and stringbean.
in and out.  yes.  and mama... and mama, is not your real mama, is she franklin?
she my foster.
she is not the first foster that you have had.  is she?
no.
do you like it at your home, franklin?
we got kittykat...
yes.... yes...
...and shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
yes.  franklin, you can not live there anymore.  with mama and shirly and kittykat.  you have to go away.
...who say...?
the government says.  mama has lost her job, so she can not be your foster mother.  the police found a marijuana cigarette in your home.  you can not see mama anymore.  or shirley.  or kitty cat.  that is what the government says...
can we identify it as dr. lechter?
not with any certainty we...
why did he come back?
our operatives in brazil have been empowered to offer a reward of....
...why did he come back?  why did the boy turn back...?
...are you alright, sir...?
he turned back into the room.  where have we seen it before.
seen what, sir..?
the puppy comes back.  if you lie on the ground.  the puppy with return.  why? do you know why...?  to kill you.  it thinks you have fallen and are powerless. it comes back to tear your throat. that is why the child turned back.  as lechter will return back.  you see?  to the sight of his oppressor wounded. he will return to savage our beloved miss starling.  bring me a drink.
...the purpose of the exercise... is it because they are expensive...
they are not expensive, you got them through your connections.... speaking of which:
fine, thank you, but
speaking of which, i want you also to get us tickets for the opera...
...whatever is within my power...
...and that is what you need to expand.
i do not understand.
we are here on sufferance.  i am here...
...why are we here in the first place...?
because it is exclusive... because everyone will be here...
...my love...
...they asked us to dinner.  how can we accept if we cannot return the...
i am on the track of...
yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, if you get it, will not buy me a new watch...
...what do you expect me to...
darling, dr. fell.  my wife madame pazzi.
enchante.
sadly, no.  and i find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. what do you think?
and how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in torture?
dr. fell is studying for his examination by the studiolo.
indeed i am.  and the connection, between dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you would come with me, i could show you...
my husband brought it to me from america.
a wonderful country...
you know it?
i have had many excellent meals there.
and yet, they are not know for their cuisine.
...should love to correct your error.
well, perhaps sometime we...
darling...
well, if you will excuse me.  madame. what a pleasure.
the commissioner is going round the cafe...
no.  invite us?  no, he simply...
then we cannot go.
because...?
because we cannot pay...
"because we do not have any money."
....because we do not have any mmm...
the case that i am working on...
it is a joke.  you are a joke.  you are a joke.  you do not know what money is-- your idea of money...  ...spend it on a whore on your 'business trip.'  that is the fine limit of your ambitions...
what was it.  what was it, honey?
...something about my father...?
...what?
do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I am going to work.
do it...
...let's see the pigs, please.
make them eat the figurine.
they will, sir.  we train them, to the figurine, eventually, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in...
...tell them...
...they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the man... i keep them hungry.  when... when do we think this man arrives.
is it necessary to know?
well, i do not want to starve them too long.  they die.
oh, no, no.  it will not be that long.
yes, but no one is in control of their emotions.  that is all we have time for today...
i do not understand.
you said:  that you have "decided." that your... your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a "self- indulgence," and you are going to put them aside.  and get on with your job.
that is right.
and you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the lechter case.
yes.
and you have decided to get married.  you have decided a lot of things.  but, in spite of your decisions--you are still "nagged" by feelings of:  despair, of failure of... you still have the nightmare, you...
what is your point?
that if decision were a useful tool, you would not be here.  why are you here...?
i..
...yes...?
i want to do something positive...
you want some advice.
yes.
your life has been defined by institutions.  the orphanage where you were raised, the fbi academy, the bureau.  if the institution is your life, accept it.  ask to be reinstated on the "drumgo" task force.  play their game.
...why?
because it is the game you have chosen. that is really all we have time for.
...a liaison position...
and what does that mean?
...i feel that...
"a liaison position with the opera."

I have left my program...

my mother told me to ignore the blandishments of charming men.
then, she, herself, possessed some knowledge of the greater world...how pleased am i to see you looking so well...
...long overdue.

how wonderful of you, to hold that information in your busy mind...
...how so?
...you told me you were studying for your examination by the studiolo...
and how good of you to remember it. then, this trip, then, is not a return to america...
no, this is pleasure...
and what was the trip before...?

...and then, we are going to greece...
yes, but the important thing, as I have said...
...get me a cigarette.
i came to pay my...

trouble is, they all seem to die.
y'want to gimme brigham's pistol?
what would you guess, ardelia?
you goin to shoot yourself?
do not shoot yourself.
why?
cause I am tired, cleaning up after you.  why dontcha gimme the gun?
he was shot...he was shot.  on his rounds.  and... and...
that is when you went to the orphanage...
and all he left us:  the country brought back his hat, and his badge... both with a bullethole in them.  an' that is what he left us.  that is what i said.
and you have been dreaming... dreaming about this hat, and...
and.  i always said, he was a p'lice officer.
...yes...?
but.  he was a night watchman.  that is what he was.  n'they brought back, his hat, his badge, an his timeclock.  n'then they took me off.  i saw... i saw.  clear as day, do you, do they call it a delusion?  his hat an his badge.  clear as day, bulletholes and all.
when?
but they were not there.  yesterday.  is that called a delusion...?
...thank you...  and how are you this evening, doctor? no, we know that you are awake...
good evening, dr. lechter.  thank you for coming.  i am sorry that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.
thank you, cordell.
...but will that satisfy you?
why should you care?
it is not that i care for you--but that i posses an enquiring mind.  what will you do when i am gone?  when you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
are you done?
yes.
you do not wish to beg...?
would that add to your mirth?
explain in depth the plan we have for him.  until tomorrow.
no, i think he proffers to spend his happy hours with his playmates.
...young boys, still...?
...here's to child abuse!
mmm...
...and then, he will be coming down.
you said the bad news...
yes, i did.
i believe that your tone implied that there was some good news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for you...
oh, yes, what?  you would bribe me, to, to, to, "release" you...?
i can make you rich.
and i expect you to.  let's talk like two medical men
come on, stay with us.  look here:  i could get behind you, and give you a spinal, tomorrow, you wuunt feel anything down there, a l'il pulling is all.  n'i'll tell you what, after he is got his jollies, ten, f'teen minutes, I will come down here, give you a shotta this  stop your heart, an that is you done, an there is an end to it.  what do you say...?  i know you got lotsa money, evabody says so.  i know how that stuff works, take it out, move it around...  ...stay with me now, fuss with it... whatsay we call your banker now, tell him a code... move that money to me, he confirms it, and i fix you up right now...  whatsay?
..suitcase...locker...
come on, doctor, then you can sleep...
...unmarked hundreds....
....what...?
..it will not be long now, sir...
ohforgodsake, get on with it.
can you walk?  are your legs working...?
perhaps... shall we see...?
I am going to cut you loose.  with all due respect, doctor, if you fuck with me, I will shoot you dead, do you understand...?  do right and you will live through this.
spoken like a protestant.
the girl could use some help.
you are free...
...which of us is free...?
yes, to cease to hope is the greatest crime.  the greatest crime.  perhaps the only crime.  i never ceased to hope!
the girl needs help.
and what would be of greater help, than to release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence.  do not you think?  in which the innocent are tortured in ways which would make the anguish of the damned seem tame and unimaginative, do not you think?  blind him again, and prepare him and her for the pigs!
...might i make a suggestion...?
...after you' re dead.  and when i give the word, do you understand...when i give the word...
...fraid, that is about it, doctor.
let the girl go.
why?
for a consideration.
'fraid it is too late.
...when i...
...what has she done to harm you...?
he do not like popcorn.
no.  and...
i like popcorn...
...yes, if you'll, just step away...
you give me whatever i want...?
yes.  you know i will.  that is right.
awright.
you look lovely.
thank you.  no, i know you would prefer "i'm glad you find me so..."
I would prefer you to say what you feel.
what is that that smells so wonderful.
i hope you will find it so.  yes.  it is good to see you regaining your strength...
thanks to you...
...i'm sorry....?
...we were speaking of my father...
indeed we were.
...and my need for the institution...
freud, do you know...?  freud psychoanalyzed patients in one afternoon.
and how did he do that?
he saw the truth, and spoke it...
I am afraid, this wine is making me woozy...
...you have to eat...
...may be the heat....
let's get her out of here....
give me your gun...
...what...?
