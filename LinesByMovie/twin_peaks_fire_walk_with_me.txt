yes...
chet, i am calling you from portland... oregon.
ok, gordon.
no, it is oregon, portland, oregon. it is regional bureau chief cole. out in portland oregon. i need you out here, chet.
ok, gordon.
oregon. a young girl has been murdered. seventeen years old. named teresa banks.
okay, gordon!!!
got a map of the environs of the yakima indian reservation with your name on it. better bring a pole.
smell something fishy, huh?
I have got a surprise for you, chet. something interesting that i would like to show you. arrangements are being made and i will meet you at the portland, airport.
congratulations. i heard about that.
your surprise, chet. her name is lil.
good luck, chet.  sam, you stick with chet, he is got his own m.o. modus operandi.  you can reach me at the philadelphia offices. i am flying out today.
right, gordon. we will be in touch.
that was really something.  that dancing girl.  what did it mean?
code. if you work with gordon you learn that right away.
code, I have heard a lot about this.
sort of shorthand.
shorthand. really?
we are heading into a difficult situation.
how do you figure?
I will explain it to you. do you remember lil's dance?
lil was wearing a sour face.
what do you mean?
her face had a sour look... that means we are going to have trouble with the local authorities. they are not going to be receptive to the fbi.
oh, the uncle is missing.
not cole's uncle but probably the sheriff's uncle in federal prison.
so the sheriff had got an uncle who is committed a serious crime.
right, which is probably why lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. let me ask you something, stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
the dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. i noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. it was not her dress or she must have lost some weight.
gordon said you were good. the tailored dress is our code for drugs. did you notice what was pinned to it?
a blue rose.
very good, but i can not tell you about that.
what did gordon's tie mean?
what? that is just gordon's bad taste.
why could not he have just told you all these things?
he talks loud. and he loves his code.
i see. he does talk loud.
gordon would not have sent us to deer meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
it must be a high priority situation.
okay, that is it. I have had enough of the waiting room now.
oh.
I am here to investigate the murder of teresa banks.
well, little fella, we do not need any outside help here. i do not like you people sniffin' around my neck of the woods. in fact, when the state boys called me about a "j. edgar" coming up i think i said, "so what?"
your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the federal government.
you are lucky i am not wasting you.
well, little fella, let me put it this way. the operative word here would be "federal". with or without the semantics of all this, i am now ordering you to release all pertinent information concerning teresa banks, both while living and deceased.
a basic kill. banks was a drifter and nobody knew her. my boys have been all over this. it is a dead end.
that is why we are here, sheriff cable. where is the body?
out back in our morgue.
it is 4:30. we close at five.
we have got our own clock. we will lock up.
solved the whiteman case with this.
that is what i heard.
no one could find those splinters without a machine like this. and no one had a machine like this.
that is good.
yes, it is good.  what do you think is in these other drawers?
i do not know, sam.
maybe, later we could take a look.
sure, but let's finish up with this first.
crushed skull. probable cause repeated blows to the back of the head with an obtuse angled blunt object. subject looks to be between 16 and 18 years of age.
cole said she was 17.
there appears to be a contusion under the ring finger of her left hand.
oh.
accidental?
agent desmond, would you hold the finger for me. there is something up there.
what is it?
it is a piece of paper with the letter "t" imprinted on it. take a look.
geez, agent desmond, it is three-thirty in the morning. where are we going to sleep?
we are not. you and i are going to get some food.
yes, it is been several hours since we have eaten. i did not realize that so much time had past, did you, agent desmond?
had the fbi here once before. back in the fifties when hap was running the place.
where is hap?
he is dead -- good and dead.
sorry to hear it.
he did not suffer.
I would like to ask you a few questions about teresa banks
sheriff cable's already asked me a few questions about teresa banks. she worked nights for a month. that is it.
any friends?
no.
ever see her with someone else?
no.
did she ever mention any friends?
no.  ask irene over there.
take a good look around. there is nobody in this place -- you are meetin' the reason why. what will it be?
how come jack let's you work here?
jack and i are united in holy matrimony.
say no more.
federal bureau of investigation, special agent chet desmond. I would like to ask you a few questions about teresa banks. jack said you knew her. how well?
she only worked here a month. nice girl. never seemed to get here on time though. ask me she had a little problem with --
came looking for a job with a friend of hers. pretty girl. could have been her sister.
what happened to her?
there was only one job. teresa took the job. her friend took a hike. never saw her again.
did you ever see teresa take cocaine?
no.
do you take cocaine, irene?
no, i do not. i never took cocaine or any other drugs. i do not take drugs.
he is with me.  anything you would like to tell us about teresa banks that would help us out?
I have thought about that. i think her death is what you would call a "freak accident".
thanks.
agent desmond, it's...
it is late, sam.
it is not late, it is early. really early.
you know, i never told anybody, but once for about three days, just before her time, teresa's arm went completely dead.
what do you mean?
her left arm. it was numb. she said she could not use it. said it had no feeling. probably from the drugs she was taking.  i just thought i ought to tell you.
thanks.
i doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. i could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to portland.
i think that is a good idea.
i think we should see the sun rise at the canyon trailer park.
are you speaking to me in a code?
no, sam, I am speaking plainly and i mean just exactly what i say.
in that case, we should go to the canyon trailer park.
federal bureau of investigation, special agent chet desmond and agent sam stanley. sorry to disturb you, but we would like to see teresa banks' trailer, please.
more popular than uncle's day at a whorehouse.  god damn, that morning sun is bright! blue bright.
mrs. simmons owns the trailer and she lives in town. teresa rented it about a month ago.
did she have someone with her?
right. she had a friend with her. the friend took off.
was there an argument?
not that i know of. but arguments do happen, do not they?
yes they do. did she have visitors?
no, hey, i already told this whole damn thing to sheriff "not-quite- able"... here's the trailer now.
she lived alone.
she must have known someone.
you better dust this place, sam.
I will get my kit.
take a look at this.
she is wearing a ring.
my guess is there is not enough detail in the photo to get an idea of the design on the ring, but we should do a blowup of this anyway.
may i see the magnifying glass, agent desmond?  there does not seem to be enough detail in the photo to ascertain the design on the ring.
you were not kiddin'. this stuff's got the sting of the forty-eight hour blend.
that is right. that is the best coffee you are going to get around here.
what are you doing here in the trailer court, deputy?
maybe i just live here, what do you think about that?
can i ask you where you were the night teresa banks was murdered?
you can tell j. edgar that i was at a party and i got fifteen fuckin' witnesses.
did you know teresa banks?
got a couple of cups of coffee at hap's from her. that is it. by the way where do you get off questioning a lawman? i could ask you the same question.
no you couldn't.
is there a golf course around here?
not a lot around here, no. got some clubs, but not very many fellas with balls.
thanks for your help, carl. sorry we woke you up.
that is alright. i was having a bad dream. i was dreamin' about a joke with no punchline.
i could not help but notice that you had a suspicion that deputy cliff was the murderer. you did think that, did not you, agent desmond?
he is not the murderer.  but he is a bozo.
yes, he is like a clown.
what the hell is that thing doing out there? you are not taking that body anywhere.
we are taking the body back to portland and there is not a thing you can do about it.
maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
teresa banks had a ring. any idea what happened to it?
we got a phone, here, that is got a little ring.
sam, get the body and put it in the van.  sheriff cable, where were you the night teresa banks was murdered?
my alibi is as strong as these bands of steel.
when he says, "discussion", how do you take that, agent desmond?
i do not take it, sam. i give it.
you try that you little monkey.
i think I will take off my badge as well.
one thing that has been troubling me. that lamp at the diner. do you think they were working on it for esthetic reasons or was their work due to faulty wiring?
faulty wiring.
esthetics are subjective, are not they, agent desmond?  I am sam stanley. if you ever need me.
thanks, sam, for the good work. you have a good eye for detail.
we do notice things, do not we, agent desmond? are you going back to the trailer park for the blue rose?
what is it, gordon?
coop, agent chet desmond has disappeared. gone like the wind in deer meadow.
agent chet said he wanted to check the trailer court one more time. he had me drive the van with the body back here. which we did. it was 105 miles.
anything else?
did gordon show you a woman named lil?
I am up to speed, stanley.
agent chet would not tell me what the blue rose meant.
and neither will i.
oh, alright.  you know, i liked agent desmond. he had his own m.o.
i cracked the whiteman case with this.
stanley, i heard all about it.
no one could have found those splinters without a machine like this and no one has a machine like this.
tell me about the letter.
take a look at this. chet and i found it under teresa banks' ring fingernail.
and no one found the ring?
no, sir, we did not.
god. I am beginning to lose faith in the united states government and that includes the telephone system. do not you folks talk to one another. that is her trailer there and i have not touched a god damn thing. agent chet desmond come by a second time and asked too see deputy cliff howard's trailer  ...which i showed him. i went back to my trailer...  after that i never saw him again.
thank you, carl.
that is not the way to cliff's trailer. i told you.
i am not going to cliff's trailer.
well, where are you going?
i am going over here.
god damn, you people are confusing.
what was here, mr. rodd?
a trailer was here. what the hell do you think?
can you tell me who is trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
an old woman and her grandson.
can you tell me what their names were?
chalfont. weird. chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. two chalfonts.
is that agent desmond's vehicle?
yep, it sure is.
phillip?
cooper, meet the long lost phillip jeffries. you may have heard of him at the academy.
he is gone.
what?
albert, come back here. he is gone call the front desk.
quickly men... word association, coop. what are you thinking about right now?
teresa banks.
albert?
it was a year ago today that teresa banks was killed. I am wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
albert, why tylenol?
if i am going to get through math today, you are going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
you did not do your homework?
noooo...
okay, this test is going to be about the theorems i told you about last week. you remember the...
do not tell me now. tell me right before the test. i will not be able to remember long enough.
you graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
thanks.
james called me last night looking for you.
when?
the usual, 9:15.
he probably wanted to drive over.
were you with bobby? or are you two still fighting?
no, and yes. i do not know what I am going to do about bobby. i know he is seeing someone else and that is okay with me, and he thinks I am seeing someone else and that is not okay with him.
are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
i do not know what to do.
you know what your problem is?  you are just too adorable...
you know, i think you are right. I am just too adorable.
laura palmer, you are just too adorable.
I am just too adorable. I am just too adorable.
james...
laura, I will meet you at 2:30 after phys. ed.
okay.
laura, do you love me?
yes, i love you. I have told you, but it does not really matter.
why? it does.
no, it doesn't... just kiss me.
it does matter. we are in love.
james, you do not know what you are talking about. quit trying to hold on so tight. I am gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
you are not a turkey. a turkey is one of the dumbest birds on earth.
gobble, gobble, gobble.
where were you for the last hour? I have been lookin' for you?
i was right behind you, but you are too dumb to turn around.  if he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.
I am not kiddin'. where were you? who were you with?
get lost bobby.
oh, yeah? you will be callin' soon and maybe I am not going to be there.
oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
are you going to see james tonight?
why are you suddenly so interested in who i am going to see at night? nighttime is my time.
you are telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you are not going to see bobby, are you?
maybe.
oh god, laura.
well, why not?
because bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. he is a goon.  james is the one.  he loves you with that "lasting love"... "true love".
yes, james is very sweet. why do not you get out your violin, donna?
sweet? god, he is gorgeous.
james is very sweet and very gorgeous.
do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
faster and faster. for a long time you would not feel anything. then you would burst into fire... forever.
maybe i better start our homework.
okay, i suppose i should go home.
call me.
sure. what do you want me to call you?
call me anything just do not call me late for dinner.
can i take the car?
sure honey, what is the hurry?
i forgot my books at school.
laura.
what?
my secret diary. there are pages missing.
who would do that?
bob.
but bob is not real.
the pages are gone. that is real.
maybe.
bob is real. he is been "having" me since i was 12.
the diary was hidden too well. he is the only one who could know where it was. he is getting to know me, now. he is real. he speaks to me.
what does bob say?
he wants to be me... or he will kill me.
no... no...
oh, yes... yes...
you are not bob are you, harold? if you are, you can kill me right now. kill me right now, if you are.
laura, no, I am not. I am not bob.  poor laura. i wish i could help you.
i hate him, i hate it. sometimes i love it. but now I am afraid. i am so afraid.
but you are strong laura... so much stronger than i... how can i help you? i can't. i can not even go outside.
what about james? can not james help you? you two are so in love.
he is in love with a girl who is dead.  it is dangerous for you to have it. I am sorry.
I am so sorry, laura.
you lied to me about those school books. i found them upstairs on your bed.
what were you doing in my room?
i was looking for that blue sweater that you borrowed which i found balled up in the bottom of your closet. now why did you lie to me? where did you go?
i had to see bobby. i know you really do not like bobby, but there was a problem and i did not think you would understand.
oh, honey, you do not have to lie to me. ever. you can tell me anything. I will understand.
I am sorry, mom.
now hurry, dinner's almost ready. your father says he is starving.
hello, laura. hello sarah. where is my axe?  "i'm hungry".
oh, leland.
dad.
hyggelig a mote dem. jeg heter leland palmer.
the norwegians are coming next week and i want you to learn to say what i just learned in norwegian. so you can talk to them. i want you to learn to say, "hello, my name is leland palmer".
but my name is not leland palmer.
neither is mine. and can not we talk about something serious for a change.
this is serious. mr. benjamin horne's got a delegation of norwegians coming in next week and i want both of you to learn to introduce yourself. sarah, you first.
cooper, the ooze of mumbo jumbo is rising up above our heads. do you honestly think cole's practice of word association works?
the very fact that we are talking about word association means we are in a space that was opened up by our practice of word association. the world is a hologram, albert.
yes, it is a great big psychedelic circus ride, is not it, cooper?
albert.
you said, "teresa banks", so you think something is going on somewhere in the world right now that is connected with her murder?
yes. either right now or right when i thought of it. the name and memory of teresa banks is haunting me. lately i have been filled with a knowingness that the murderer will strike again. because it is only a feeling, i am powerless to stop it. and another thing, albert, when the next murder happens you will help me solve it.
let's test it for the record. will the next victim be a man or a woman?
a woman.
what color hair will she have?
blonde.
tell me some other things about her.
she is in high school. she is sexually active. she is on drugs. she is crying out for some help.
you are describing half the high school girls in america.  what is she doing right now?
she is preparing a great abundance of food.
shelly, would you give laura a quick hand with the "meals on wheels"?
I am kind of busy, norma.
you are not busy, sweetheart, now go.
laura just took off. she asked me to do the run today. should i do it?
what is with that laura? yeah, sure, take a look around. there is no one here anyway.
you are right. there is no one here.
there is no one here.
norma, are you alright?
come back as soon as you can.
if leo comes here, he will not believe that i am out doing the "meals on wheels".
do not worry, shelly, I will handle leo.
laura?
donna, are you my best friend?
of course...
what is it laura? what is wrong?
i just want a friend. just one friend for just one minute...
laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
yes, that is what i want. thanks d.
okay, l.  i am your friend... always. but sometimes... lately... i feel that you do not like being around me because i am so uptight.  no, i am uptight. i hate it... i do not want to be this way, but laura i don't... i mean... I am your friend no matter what way you are.
you know, even when i think about your face i get happier.
do you want to talk?
no, i want to smoke.
I am in a mess today, too.  I am thinking about doing it with mike. what do you think?
donna, you are such a crack up. you do not even like mike. is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
this is about sex, not like.  mom, laura's here and i think i will have one of those huckleberry muffins.  you want a muffin?
if i can smoke it.
you want a muffin?
donna, you are a muffin.
goodbye, muffin.
no, you are the muffin.
hi, honey, how is donna?
fine.
school?
...school's fine...
sit down... sit down... are you hungry?
not really.
let me see.
dad...
your hands are filthy... look, there is dirt way under this fingernail.
leland, what are you doing?
look at this finger here.
leland...
laura did not wash her hands before dinner.  and look at this.
did you get this from your lover?
they do not call them lovers in high school, leland.
bobby did not give you this?
how would you know if bobby did not give her that?
did bobby give you that or is there someone new?
leland leave her alone... she does not like that. stop it.
how do you know what she does not like?
oh, leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
oh, I will sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till laura goes and washes her hands.
where were you last night? we were supposed to get together. you did not show up.
you were supposed to show up. maybe i wasn't.
we were supposed to be together.
how can i be together if I am not together?
you are on somethin' again, are not you?
james...
when am i going to see you?
who was that?
a friend from school.
a special friend?
no... no, go away.
I am glad you let me talk to you. you used to not let me talk to you.
go away. i am not talking to you.
i want you.
laura, now i can not find that blue sweater. did you take it again?
mom... what are you wearing?
my god, i am going to have another breakdown. god, god.
mom, take it easy.
someone who knows how to clean knows where the object was before she started cleaning and then that object goes back to its exact same spot. shelly, i know where everything in this house is. sometimes on the road i mentally go through this whole house and picture where every item is.
lay off the bennies, leo.
anybody can clean the surface of an object, but dirt can find its way anywhere. to really clean, you have to scrub below the surface.  where the dirt is, shelly.
that is one thing you are going to learn, shelly, -- how to clean. it takes scrubbing, shelly. there is no easy way. this is where we live, shelly.
as if i did not know.
I am going to show you how to wash this tile and then you are going to do it.
come off it, leo. I am late for work...
what did you say?
where are you going?
no place, fast.  and you are not coming.
come on, laura. I am your best friend.
is not tonight the night you are going to do it with mike?
laura, are not you going to fix me a drink?
where are the cookies?
you mean fred and ginger?
dancing.
if i had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I would be dead.
got to go, donna. I will call you tomorrow.
what are you doing?
nothing.
no.  i do not need to take this to be your friend.
yes you do, donna. what a downer you are!!!
baby, you know why? cause it will never get here.
hey, jacques...
no "jacques". i am the great went.
i am the muffin.
and what a muffin you have.
that is right. she called me. she even asked me what your fathers looked like...
what? she asked about my father?
but it was not him... she was after a huge guy, six foot four with a broken nose. she said he looked just like a boxer. speaking of sandwiches... i think bobby was arranging something for you...  speaking of arrangements...  speaking of arrangements... why do not you two come up to the cabin this week? leo and i know that santy claus is coming to town... thursday.
see what we can do to donna?
no! god, no...
do not ever wear my stuff, do not ever wear my stuff. never.
okay, i will not wear your stuff... why can not i wear your stuff?
jacques, help me get her home. now!
i will not wear your stuff.  i promise.
not you, donna, not you.
josie, i think we should go public.
that would be wonderful, but it is only been a year since andrew died.
what are you afraid of? what people think?
i do not want to offend the customs of your country.
believe me, josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. for instance, i do not eat fish eyes.
fish eyes?
even if it offended someone, i would not eat a fish eye.
why would not you eat a fish eye, harry?
i saw a guy eat a fish eye once in seattle. he was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat. i guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble. his throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing. and he could not swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still could not get the fish eye out and they tried to do a heimlich maneuver. i went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy. they were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling. splat! it just stuck up there and spread out. it was about the size of a half dollar. and that is why i do not ever eat fish eyes.
I am not saying it is right or wrong, it is just the way i feel. it is the custom thing i was thinking of. in america we do not use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. we throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.
i understand.
we throw away the whole head.
i can not remember anything about last night. is there something i should remember?
no, you should forget about last night.
laura, i am your friend.
i know you are and you do not have to do anything crazy to prove it.
you are not mad at me?
no.
i feel so bad. i had nightmares all night long.  they all knew you at that place.
what can i tell you?
how did the car get back here?
we got it back, that is all.
how did i get in the house? how did i get into my bed?
i can not help you there.
was i wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
all my things have me in them. i do not want you to be like me.
but i love you, laura.
and i love you, too. but do not wear my stuff.
why do you do it, laura?
cause i like it.
when is the next business trip, big fella?
soon. how about next time we party with the girlfriends you told me about?
i can arrange that. i like that.
what are you doing?
who am i?
i do not know.
that is right.
dad... dad... who was that? how do you know him? he looked familiar. have i met him?
no, you have not met him. have you met him?
no.
we are late to get to your mother.
just sit here for a moment. you seem very upset.
guy just pulls up out of the blue... i mean... what is this world coming to?
what is wrong?
nothing, i chickened out.
are you sure you are okay?
yes.
dad?
yes.
did you come home during the day last week?
no.
oh, i thought i saw you.
you know, i did come home, come to think of it, on thursday. i had a severe headache and i was driving in the neighborhood so i just darted in and out of the house.  where were you, laura? i did not see you?
i was down the street.
that is not important. i will tell you what is important. the fan will soon be starting.
who are you? who are you really?
i am the one who wants to breathe thru your nose and taste thru your mouth.
I am nearly out.
it is taken care of, babe. you and i are going to make a big score tonight.  this will tide you over.
thank you, bobby. a big score?
maybe our biggest. I will see you two doors down from your place at 11:00.
do not be late.
I have got to see you.
not now.
this afternoon?
okay.  oh god, it is johnny horne's birthday today.
what about tonight?
i can not tonight.
what is going on?
i just can't, james. i can not do it.
johnny, johnny... let your daddy and your uncle and leland talk.  ben... leland, we can play the french against the norwegians. what do the french love more than anything?
boating?
no.
hiking?
no.
eating?
you would think so.
sex?
you are getting warmer.
trees?
exactment. they are nuts about wood. they get goofy over trees.
history is on our side, ben. it is no accident that the great explorers were named hennepin, nicollet, marquette.
they were looking for wood.
hey, pete. can not believe your tank's dry up at the mill.
no... hell, no. just got in the truck, started drivin', looked down at the gauge and saw a big "e" starin' at me.
you know what that big "e" stands for? big ed's gas farm.
yep. you are right. that is why I am here.
what will it be?
fill 'er up.
you got it.
i have not got it yet.
nice night.
yep...  yes...  it is.
you missed somethin', ed.
i did? i did not see anything.
yeah... look in here. look at it from this angle.
even this heavy work beats being at home with the old ball and chain.
brother, i hear you talkin'.
here he comes.
here he comes.
this is not mike.  is this mike?
bobby... ssshhhh... you killed mike.
no.
