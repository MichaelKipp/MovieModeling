what is the matter, doris? business bad?
it sure is.

see duff. he is the money man.
what d'you say, duff?
give her a beer.
thanks, duff. you' a nice guy. not like frankie.
you know, doris - you would make some guy a swell wife.
you think so, frankie?
hell, you got steady work.
where' you goin'?
out.
want me to come?
no thanks.
come on, honey.
where' you goin'?
'round town.
what is so hot 'round town?
take it easy, frankie.
thank you, ma'am. that is fine.
you must be new in town.
I will have me some of that punch there, too.
have not seen you around, have i?
no. I am new in town.
you working?
yeah. on the section gang.
oh yeah?
you work around town?
I am a teacher.
went to college, huh?
in birmingham.
oh yeah? that is my home town.
your folks live there?
no. my mother's dead.  you goin' back inside?
yes, are not you?
no. never had much use for hell-howlers. you goin'?
my father's the preacher.
oh yeah? well, i guess you got no choice.
that is right.
look, i do not know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
maybe.
man, you will not like that back seat.
man, why 'you messin' around with a gal like that? you will not get no place.
hell, they are all after the same thing.
yeah. all a colored woman wants is your money.
what d'you know about women, pop?
well, i got married to one of them.
hell, i did not know you was married.
sure. got a sixteen-year-old girl.
is that right?  think you are going to make it with her?
just get her drunk.
how 'bout the key?
i bet she is easy jam.
that is pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
what d'you expect?
you know, baby, i can not figure you out.
how d'you mean?
why d'you come out with me? you slummin' or something?
no.
so what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
you do not think much of yourself, do you?
well, that is a funny thing to say.
you keep asking me why I am here.
yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
i like a place with lots of life.
how about another beer?
no thanks.
go on - you can have one!
hell!
what is it?
well, if it am not duff!
how you doin'?  hi there!
we was just leavin', fellows.
let's go, jocko. the man's got homework.
see you, duff.
yeah, see you in hell.
they must work on the section gang.
that is right.
well, they seem just like everyone else.
hell, baby, i bet you think we got tails.
i guess it is hard working on the road like that.
damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
i mean, you are kind of cut off, are not you?
that is fine with me. keeps me out of trouble.
how d'you mean?
well, i do not get on so well most places.
i see. that beer made me dizzy.
well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
you got a problem all right.
get out of here!
do not duff--
i said: cut it out!
do not start no trouble, boy!
let's go, duff.
take it easy.
how come you stay 'round here?
well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. nobody bothers with those kids.
that is why you come back, huh?
it is hard to see any change. but I am going to stay. another year, anyway.
you got more guts than me, baby. it is a no-good town.
it is better than it used to be. eight years ago they still had a lynching here. they tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. my father knew who did it, but he did not say anything.
scared, huh?
not here, duff.
i get it.  yeah, i can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
but i would like to see you again.
you would, huh? if i was you, baby - i would not go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
what d'you mean?
you almost got into trouble back there.
i would not have let you.
hell, baby, I am not in the third grade. well, look - what' we going to do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
no, on the porch.
oh yeah, and then what?
what?
well, either we are going to hit the hay or get married. now you do not want to hit the hay, and i don' want to get married.
you have some very primitive ideas, do not you?
all right, so I am primitive. so what d'you want with me?
look, duff - most of the men i know - they are kind of sad. when i met you the other day i had a feeling that you are different. that is why i went out with you. i thought we might have something to say to each other.
hell, baby, i do not know what to say.
good night, duff.
at first it was real strange. hell, japan is a long ways from alabama. really got under my skin, though. almost did not come back.
why did you?
i do not know. 'guess i belong here more than there.
'been up north?
yeah. knocked around for a couple of months after the army. you been there?
no.
well, it am not that good up there neither. might as well make it here. 'course i am not really makin' it now.
hello.
how are you?
all right, son.
so you are courtin' the preacher's girl. well, just watch your step, boy, or he will preach you right into hell.  I am counting on you, reverend.
i understand.
would not do for one of your people to sue at a time like this.
i know.
I will talk to the mayor.
that will make the folks very happy.
it is hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
guess it is never been easy.
it is a changing time. sit down, son.
thank you.
well, it looks like we will be getting our new school.
how come you all am not sendin' them to the same school?
well, you have got to go easy. we have not had any trouble in town for eight years, and we are not going to have any now.
can not live without trouble, can you?  nice place you got here. real nice.
yes, the lord's been pretty good to us. i guess you are a church man, are not you?
i guess i ain't.
why? do not you believe in the lord?
aw, i do. but 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. it is the whites that need it real bad.
i think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you would soon change your tune.
i doubt it.
i see.  well, i guess we do not have much to say to each other.
i guess not.
and since we are talking, my wife and i do not want you hanging around our daughter.
well, that figures.  kind of fits in with everything else, do not it!
am not your fault.
that is the way he is.
yeah. it is just like i figured.
what d'you mean?
hell, i do not belong here. i do not know what i' been thinkin'.
look, duff - if you are free, I am not working tomorrow.
sorry, baby. I am goin' to birmingham.
just for the day?
goin' to see my kid.
i did not know you had one.
yeah. well, i do.
are you married?
no, i am not married.  well, good-bye.
surprised?
no. women're always followin' me 'round.
I am just going in to do my shopping.
yeah, it is just a coincidence.
that is right.
I will see you later.
come here, duff. no point running away from coincidence.
how old is your boy?
four.
what is he like?
i am not seen him in a couple of years.
what d'you want?
guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I am duff anderson.
'bout time you showed. door's open.
james lee, you come in here and meet your daddy.
where is wilma?
she done moved to detroit.
am not she goin' to take the boy?
she got herself a husband now. they don' want him 'round. and i tell you, man, i got no use for him neither.
i been sendin' her money.
well, she never gave me none. look, you better find him a place pretty quick.
like where?
i do not know. he is your boy.
i am not so sure of that. if i was, maybe I would feel different.
yeah. look, I will be sendin' you the money from now on.
okay.
make sure he gets those shots.
they say your dad's 'round town.
'that right? i thought he was up north.
people seen him 'round.
where is he at?
i do not know.
'you will anderson?
who are you?
I am duff.
would not have known you.
would not have known you.
what is on your mind?
nothing. heard you were in town.
wanted a look at your old man, huh?
yeah. that is right.
how about a drink?
okay.
what happened?
workin' a saw mill.  here's to.
baby - want you to meet duff.
hi.
he is my son!
come on, will.
what is the matter?! you mad at me?
no. why?
nothin'.  she is all right. would not have made it without her. christ - have not worked in eight months. right now, I am waitin' for some insurance money. and man, when i get it, i got plans to make me some more.  let's get out'a here. this place gives me the willies.  you got some money?
let's stay here, will.
what is the matter?! it is a celebration!
i said, i come to town with a girl.
plannin' on getting married?
no.
'don't sound so sure.
well, matter of fact, i done a lot of bangin' 'round.
yeah. that is how me an' your mother got started. I am tellin' you, boy, you am not got a chance without dough. they take it all away from you.
pour your own trouble, will.
your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. did you know that?
shut up, will.
okay, so what is a girl supposed to do? me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I am tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. ya got to stay light on your feet or you will not make it.
is she good in the hay? no point marryin' her just to find out. is there, baby?
if you do not quit it, will, I am leaving.
you are breaking my heart.  got to see a man about a dog.
how often does he get like that?
whenever he is got an edge on.
how often is that?
he is been hitting it pretty hard. got high blood pressure, too. i guess it is hard on him, having you around.
i asked you somethin', boy!
i heard you.
pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
great.
what d'you want anyhow? what you come and bother me for?
he is your son.
okay, boy, beat it.
come back some other time, will you?
yeah, sure. good luck.
hi.
i thought you was not comin'.
how did it go?
what?
your boy.
okay, i guess.
I will have some coffee, please.
you know, i been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
what d'you mean?
just what i said. do not look so scared.
thank you.
how about it?
what happened, duff?
look, baby - i do not know 'bout you, but it is the right thing for me. i just know it is. so, what d'you say?
do not push me, duff.
yeah. would not be no picnic for you. i am not exactly housebroken.
what about that girl?
she do not mean nothin' to me. that is all over.  hell, baby - I am askin' you to marry me. i guess you want a big scene, huh?
no. but a small one.
I will be a monkey's kid sister! what d'you want to do a thing like that for?
'musta knocked her up.
what are you going to get out of it, huh?
a whole lot, frankie.
like what?
like a home, for one thing.
you gonna sit at home the rest of your life? jesus!
well, it is better than windin' up like a bum.
what 'you signifyin'?
i was not thinkin' about you, frankie.
old doris sure goin' to miss you.
just give him a couple of months. a girl like that, she do not know any tricks.
you know what doris told me? she say: that duff's a nice guy. would not even charge him nothin'.
i guess you will be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
that is right.
man, you must be plumb outa your mind! you will be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you are lucky.
i can see why.
well, what d'you think?
it is okay with me, baby. but how' you goin' to like it?
it will be fine when we get done with it.
that is bessie hall. barney works at the mill.
yeah?
hey, watch out! guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
do not call them that.
that is all right with me. always liked kids.
what about him?
he could live with us.
let's just see how the two of us make out first, huh?
hard to get up in the morning, huh?
that is right. how' you doin', barney?
hey, boy - I am talkin' to you.
name's duff.
how 'you doing?
okay.
looks like you are doin' a good job.
thanks.
do not say much, do you?
guess i don't.
just so you do your work.
what is the matter, boy? never smile?
I will smile when it is funny.
so it was not funny, huh? well, i thought it was. what d'you say, barney? was not it funny?!
i know.
you' new here, man!  see you, boys.
you know, man, that guy was trying to be friendly.
that am not my idea of friendliness.
like hell. you know, if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it.
like hell they wouldn't.
is that so?
yeah, that is so.
what is wrong?
smells like something crawled in there and died.
oh really? i thought it was pretty good.
come here, baby.
everything you cook is good.
duff - you know those women you used to know--
what about them?
am i as good as they?
hmmm - good coffee.
you did not answer my question.
baby, you are the best thing that ever happened to me.
you still did not answer my question.
well, if you do not know i can not tell you.
you know how to box?
uh-huh. why?
my kids want me to teach them.
okay. come on. put 'em up!
like so. there you go. okay, hit me!
i do not want to hurt you.
go on - hit me!
it sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. i seen hundreds of them - all my life.
my father's never done a thing for any of them.
they all got families to support.
yeah. that is right, jocko.  those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
i guess you will be making' some changes 'round here.
what is eatin' you, jocko?
nothin'. i just figure you were the right man for the job.
good-bye, frankie.
'got a good thing, man.
'see ya.
'bye, jocko.
how would you like to have a baby, duff?
huh?
do not look so scared.
you jivin' me?
well, i have not come around.
am not that something?!  that is just fine, baby.
we will be all right.
man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
what about your boy?
how come you keep askin'?
i keep thinking about him.
well, he am not mine, so skip it.
'you duff anderson?
that is right.
want to talk to you.
okay.
i hear you are tryin' to organize this place!
i do not know what you are talkin' about.
that is no way to talk, boy. now we had one of them union men 'round here coupla years ago. stirred up a lot of trouble. they are always after you colored boys.
i still do not know what you are talkin' about.
you a union man?
used to be. on the railroad.
uh-huh. well, this am not the railroad. now what is all this talk about stickin' together?
well, what d'you know?!
look, boy, we got a smooth operation here, and i aim to keep it that way. now i got an idea you are plannin' trouble.
no. you got the wrong idea.
all right, then. all i want you to do is tell these boys here you did not mean what you said about stickin' together an' all.
want to keep your job, boy?
what d'you think?
then do like i said.  men - this boy here's got something to tell you-all.  well, how about it?
don't, duff.
yeah.
do not deny me, duff.
hell, baby - i met this beautiful chick and she is just dyin' for me, okay?
yeah. but just how're we goin' to make out? i got to get me a job.
you will.
pay is so damn low. i do not want my kids to grow up like barney's.
they won't.
I am telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
we can always do that, duff.
yeah. yeah, i know. I am not really thinkin' about it. anyway, do not want those white guys laughin' up their sleeve at me when they see me pull out.
yeah.
where was that?
walker and williams.
what did you say your name is?
anderson.
how 'you doin' man?
okay.
cup of coffee.  i 'been meanin' to talk to you.
oh yeah?
you know, over at the mill, there is just one guy that talked. it is kinda late to say it, but we shoulda acted different.
been over to the other mill?
yeah, i been there.
it is just that we are not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. kinda took us by surprise.
oh yeah? that is good.
how 'bout that furniture plant?
man, the darkest thing they got in there is coca-cola.
yeah.
now, if you want to work like a real nigger, you can always go out and chop cotton.
they done that too long in my family.
they pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
hi.
do not ask, baby - huh!  how much money you got with you?
about ten dollars.
water pump's busted. i do not know if it is worth fixin', but i need that car.
you can have what I have got. it is right there.
you know - we do have enough money. especially now.
sure, baby. 'fact, i do not ever have to work no more. when that baby comes, i can just stay home and send you back to school. how about that?
I am trying to help, duff.
yeah!
i could work even after the baby comes. a few hours a week, anyway.
what the hell could you do?
day work.
'you kiddin'? you am not goin' to no white home. i seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
no point fixin' it!
what are you going to do?
do not do that!
watch out!
you heard me!
i can not stand to see you like that. i know you can not help it.
stop bein' so damn understandin'.
i know just how you feel, son. but believe me, you are going about it the wrong way.
do not look like there is a right way.
well, you have to be reasonable. now they say you are a troublemaker. that is no good. use a little psychology. make 'em think you are going along - and get what you want.
it am not in me.
you will be in trouble, son.  now just how do you intend to support your family?
i guess I will rob a bank.
do not you get smart with me, boy.
so i been told.
it is for your own good.
oh yeah?  seems to me, reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
you can be cocky now, boy. but you will not make it. you will not last. i just feel sorry for josie. i knew it would not work out.
well, at least she am not married to no white man's nigger! you been stoopin' so long, reverend, you do not even know how to stand straight no more. you' just half a man!
maybe i could talk to bud ellis. he might have a job for you at his filling station.
oh yeah?
I will be seeing you.
how come you do not hate their guts?
i do not know. i guess I am not afraid of them.
you were plenty scared that night in the car.
just of getting hurt. they can not touch me inside.
like hell they can't.  they can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
not if you see them for what they are, duff.
jesus, baby, you are so full of talk! well, you am not never really been a nigger, have you - livin' like that in your father's house! so just shut your mouth.
that is two bucks, joe.
why do not you come over for a beer when you get through?
okay, i will.
how you doin', boy?
okay.
want me to hold the light for you?
no, thanks.
just tryin' to be helpful.
most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. got to understand them, that is all. how you doin', boy?
okay.
seems a little loose!
she will do.
jesus, i told you to watch it!
sorry.
that is the trouble with you boys! do not listen when a man tells you something.
she do not look no worse to me.
do not do her no good to get banged like that.
do not do her no good to go into a tree.
what did you say, boy?!
i said, she is in great shape.
i heard you! now 'stead of bein' smart, you just get that car out of here!
fill her up?
no, boy. thirty-eight cents worth of gas. and watch you do not make it thirty-nine.
boy - you hear me?!
that will be thirty-eight cents.
goddamnit, nigger - you must think you are white! who d'you think you are - king of harlem?
that will be thirty-eight cents.
you in a big hurry, boy?
i bet she is a sly little nigger, that girl. would not mind a piece of her myself!
all right, you get out of here, man!
who are you tellin' to get, boy?! you watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
that dyin's going to be done two ways.
hell, if they do not blow up his place, they will get him some other way. do not make no difference no-how.
what d'you mean?
nothin. quit lookin' at me like that!
duff, i love you.
well, that do not do me one bit of good!
am not you goin' to say something?
there is nothing to say.
well, that will be the first time.
where are you going to go?
when i get set, I will send for you.
i do not think that will happen.
you will be better off without me. i am not fit to live with no more. it is just like a lynchin'. maybe they do not use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
you are not a man because of a job, duff.
you don' know nothin' 'bout it, baby. nothin'! and do not kid yourself - you did your bit.
okay.
duff--
like i said, baby - I will write you.
my son? i am not got no son. you duff?
that is right.
beat it!
take it easy, pop.
what is the matter? do not smell so good, huh? must'a broken some records.
come on, pop.
nothing you can do. been like this for days.
now you stay put!
i am not drunk, honey.
like hell you ain't!
got a thick feelin' here.
what is the matter now?
better now.  where 'you at?
right here.
could not get the words out before.
better get him to a hospital.
did not i tell you to beat it - huh?
let's go.
anything you say, baby.
thanks.
would you like me to say anything tomorrow?
guess so.
have anything in mind?
no. what you usually say, i guess.
where was your father born?
i do not know.
his profession?
well, he worked around.
and his age?
i do not know. forty-eight, i guess.
any other family?
no. just me.  me an' her.
well, i guess that is all till tomorrow.
okay, thanks very much.
want to come up the house? you can stay there till you get on your feet. there is no point paying a hotel.
no thanks, lee.
it is just that i hate empty rooms.
sure.
well, what are you going to do?
i guess I will make me some trouble in that town.
going back, huh?
that is right.
they will run you out.
no, they won't.
how 'you going to live?
i can always chop cotton if i have to.  if you want a ride, I will take you home.
no, thanks. I will take the bus.
okay.
do not be too hard on him.
hell, I am just like him.
i know he was not much of a father.
who is?!
good-bye, duff.
