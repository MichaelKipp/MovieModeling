i should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. you do not want to talk about it here...
i do not want to talk about it anywhere.  if you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. molly and kevin will be back soon.
how much do you know?
what was in the 'miami herald' and the 'times.'  confessions?
eighty-six so far. all cranks. he smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  none of them knew that;
what else did you keep out of the papers?
blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. the prints are all smooth gloves. he is on a full moon cycle. both times. his blood is ab positive.
somebody hurt him?
typed him from semen. he is a secretor.
will... you saw this in the papers. the second one was all over tv. did you ever think about givin' me a call?
no.
why not?
the bureau already has the best lab. plus you have bloom at the university of chicago...
and i got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors.
you do not need me. i would not be useful to you anymore, jack.
last two like this we had, you caught.
that was three years ago. and by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing.
that is not entirely true, will. it is the way you think.
i think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way i think.  i came down here to get away from all that.
you look all right now.
i am all right.
if you can not look anymore, i understand...
as long as they are dead...
these are all dead, will.
let's talk after dinner. stay and eat.
I will come back later. i got messages at the holiday inn to collect.
he stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here.
what did he want?
he asked how you are.
and you said?
i said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone.
I am a forensic specialist, molly. you have seen my diploma?  i got a diploma and everything.
you mended a crack in the wallpaper with your diploma.  you are open and easy now... it took you a lot of work to get to that...
we have it good, do not we?
all the things that happened to you before make you know that...
what the hell can i do?
what you have already decided. you are not really asking.
if i were?
stay here with me. me. me. me.  and kevin.  that is selfish, huh?
i do not care.  he will never see me or know my name. if we find him, the police will have to take him down. not me, I am just looking at evidence.
will it keep them out?
yeah...
how many turtle eggs you think are in here?
in this hatchery? forty to fifty.
crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
yeah, but not now... these will all make it... guaranteed.
whatever i say, you will take him away, will not you?
i have to.
you are his friend, jack. why can not you leave him alone?
because it is his bad luck to be special.
he thinks you want him to look at evidence.
nobody's better with evidence. but he has the other thing, too. he does not like that part of it...
you would not like it, either if you had it.
talking about 'like,' you do not like me very much, do you?
no.  i do not like people who park in the 'handicapped zone'...
I will try to keep him as far away from it as i can...
thanks for the lift.
I will come inside with you, if you like, but mr. crawford said you would probably want to be alone.
that is right.
there is a vtr setup waiting in your hotel room, that you asked for. they transferred the home movies of both families onto half-inch vhs.
thanks.
molly?
huh?  will? is that you?
it is me. I will call you tomorrow, sweetheart. go back to sleep.  i love you...
mmmmh... i love you, too, will. good night.
jack, this is graham. is price still in latent prints?
he is working on the single print index. what time is it?
get him to atlanta.
you said the guy down here is good.
he is good. bur not as good as price.
what do you want to do?
mrs. leeds' fingernails and toenails. i think he took off his gloves, jack.  and dust all the corneas of all their eyes.
our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. they dusted everything.
the report did not mention nails and eyes.
why do you think he took his gloves off?
mrs. leeds was a good-looking woman. I would want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, would not you?
'intimate? !"
yes. 'intimate.' they had privacy.  everybody else was dead.
he may have a history of biting -- barroom fights or child abuse.
he only bit women so far, right?
that is all we know about.  most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. a suck mark. these don't. so, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.  you could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. i know that is pretty thin...  he bites a lot.
what is average?
sex murder: three. he likes to bite. six bad ones in mrs. leeds.  eight in mrs. jacobi...  ...that's all i have.
the commissioner was saying you were the one that caught dr. lecktor three years ago.  he killed nine people, did not he?
nine that we know of. two did not die.
what happened to them?
one's on the respirator at a hospital in baltimore. the other is in a private mental hospital in denver.
what did the psychologists say was wrong with lecktor?
psychologists call him a sociopath. they do not know what else to call him.
what would you call him?
to yourself...
i call him a monster.
i understand he cut you pretty good...
what about the dog?
it is at the vet's. the kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.
was the dog wearing a collar with the leeds' name on it?
no.
did the jacobis in birmingham have a dog?
a cat. we found a litter box downstairs but not the cat.  neighbors are watching for it.
why do not you get birmingham p.d. a methane probe out of d.c. and have them cover the backyard...  maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.
...snuck in the hospital while i was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. the only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...
i know...
atlanta and birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. five will get you ten they do not come up with an identification. jimmie may in the finder program... if he is ever been printed and in his index.
say we have arrested a good suspect. you walk in and see him. what is there about him that does not surprise you?
i do not know, jack. he is got no face for me.
you can tell something about him or we would not have found the finger print...
do not expect too much from me, jack, all right?  we will get him one way or the other.
what is one way?
we find an event that connects both families. same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  if we find out how he found them, then we will find him.
we are running it through the computers now. so far there is no event or service that doubles back into both families. plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. it is a haystack.  what is the other?
he makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.
no other possibilities?
you think I am going to spot him 'across a crowded room?'  that is ezio pinza you are thinking about.  the tooth fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. he will not stop.
why?
because he has a genuine taste for it, jack.
see? you do know something about him.
...i'm going to see lecktor.
for christ's sake, why?
to recover the mind set.
hello, hotshot!
hey, baby! where are you?
at the store. you doin' some good?
none you would notice. I am lonely...
me, too. and very erotic...
tell me about yourself.
which part? that or the day-to-day.
let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  how is kevin?
kevin's fine. he had to recover the turtle eggs you two fenced in. the dogs dug them up. tell me what you are doing.
eating junk food.  they do not have a lock on anything, molly. there is not enough information. or i have not done enough with it...
will you be in atlanta for a while? I am not buggin' you about coming home, i just wondered.
i do not know. I am goin' up to baltimore this afternoon.
to do what?
i have to see somebody.
I am thinking about painting the kitchen. what color do you like, will? are you there?
yeah. ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
yellow's a bad color for me.  I will look green at breakfast.
blue, then.
blue is cold.
hey, goddamn it, paint it shit-brown for all i care...  look, I am sorry. when i come home, we will go to the paint store together and get some chips and...
molly, dear molly. go to bed now, baby...
i love you...
dr. lecktor will stay in his room. that is absolutely the only place where he is not put in full body restraints. one wall of his room is a double barrier. i will have a chair put just outside.
i might have to show him some material that could stimulate him.
as long as it is on soft paper.  you may...  find this curious.
the consensus around here is that the only person who has demonstrated any practical understanding of dr. hannibal lecktor is you, mr. graham. can you tell me anything about him?
no.
when you saw dr. lecktor's murders, their 'style,' so to speak, were you able to reconstruct his fantasies? and did that help you identify him?
i want to see lecktor now.
uh... sure...
that is the same atrocious aftershave you wore in court three years ago.
i keep getting it for christmas.
did you get my card?
i got it. thank you.
and how is officer stuart? the one who was the first to see my basement.
stuart is fine.
emotional problems, i hear. he was a very promising young officer. do you ever have any problems, will?
no.
of course, you don't.  I am glad you came. my callers are all professional. clinical psychiatrists from cornfield colleges somewhere. second-raters, the lot.
dr. bloom showed me your article on surgical addiction in the journal of clinical psychiatry.
and?
very interesting, even to a layman.
a layman..., layman. interesting term. so many experts on government grants. and you say you are a 'layman?' but it was you who caught me, was not it, will? do you know how you did it'
you have read the transcript. it is all there.
no it is not. do you know how you did it will?
it is in the transcript. what does it matter now?
it does not matter to me, will.
i want you to help me, dr. lecktor.
yes, i thought so.
it is about atlanta and birmingham.
yes.
you read about it, I am sure.
in the papers. i do not tear out the articles.  i would not want them to think i was dwelling on anything morbid. you want to know how he is choosing them, do not you?
i thought you would have some ideas.
why should i tell you?
there are things you do not have. research materials... i could speak to the chief of staff...?
chilton? gruesome, is not he? he fumbles at your head like a freshman pulling at a panty girdle.  he actually tries to give me a thematic and apperception test. hah. sat there waiting for mf-13 to come up. it is a card with a woman in bed and a man in the foreground.  i was supposed to avoid a sexual interpretation. i laughed in his face.  never mind, it is boring.
you will get to see the file on this case. and there is another reason.
pray tell.
i thought you might be curious to find our if you are smarter than the person I am looking for.
then by implication, you think that you are smarter than me, since you caught me.
no. i knew that I am not smarter than you are.
then how did you catch me, will?
you had disadvantages.
what disadvantage?
you are insane.
you are very tan, will.
do not think you can persuade me with appeals to my intellectual vanity.
i do not think I will persuade you. you will do it or you won't. dr. bloom is working an it anyway, and he is the best...
do you have the file with you
yes.
pictures?
yes.
let me have them, and i might consider it.
no.
do you dream much, will?
good-bye, dr. lecktor.
you have not threatened to take away my books yet.
what were the yards like?
big backyards, fences, some hedges, why?
because, my dear will, if this pilgrim imagines he has a relationship with the full moon, he might go outside and look at it.  have you seen blood in moonlight, will? it appears quite black. if one were nude, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for this sort of thing.
that is interesting.
it is not 'interesting'. you thought of it before.
yes. I would considered it.
you came here to look at me, will. to get the old scent again, did not you?
i want your opinion.
i do not have one right now.
when you do have one I would like to hear it.
may i keep the file?
i have not decided yet.
I will study it, will. when you get more files, I would like to see them, too. you can call me. when i have to call my lawyer, they bring me a telephone. would you like to give me your home number?
no.
do you know how you caught me, will?
goodbye, dr. lecktor. you can leave messages for me at the number on the file.
linda king's desk.
hi, linda. ..
linda does not come in nights.
maybe you can help me. this is bob greer of blaine & edwards publishing company. dr. bloom asked me to send a copy of 'the psychiatrist and the law' to someone. linda never sent me the address and phone number.
she will be in, in the morning...
i have to catch federal express within about five minutes. I would be immensely appreciative if you would pull it out of her rolodex for me.
she does not have a rolodex.
I will bet she has a call caddy right next to her phone.
yeah...
well, zip that little pointer right on down to the letter g.
okay.
we are looking for graham. the man the book is supposed to go to is a mr. will graham.
federal bureau of investigation, tenth and pennsylvania, washington, d.c.
now I will bet it has his home address there, too
3680 desoto highway. marathon, florida.
thank you very much.
is it weird?
the mark? yes.
if the documents section can not do it... I will send it up to langley...
did price get anywhere with the single prints off the leeds?
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, hold on. what?
he asked for will. he said he might call back tonight. i tried to hold him... I am sorry... he said 'tell graham "broken mirrors."'
will. get right back here. he just called.
who did he ask for?
you.
where the hell's graham!
he went to the men's room.
for christ's sake get him!
this is will graham. can i help you?
no. i can help you.
i do not understand.
atlanta and birmingham.
do you know something about that?
why do you think i called?
i get a lot of calls. most of them are from people who say they know things.
talk to them a few minutes and you can tell they do not have the capacity to even understand what is going on. do you?
you tell me what you know about him. I will tell you whether you are right or not.
let's get straight who we have talking about.  are you the man I am interested in?
i do not think I will tell you.
he is right-handed.
most people are.
he is misunderstood.
cut the general crap.
he is very strong physically.
that is true.
he is white and six feet tall. you have not told me anything yet.
describe exactly what you think he did to mrs. leeds and I will tell you if you are right or not.
i do not want to do that,
goodbye.
come in.
dr. chilton.
yes?
when we were cleaning out dr. lector's cell, he heard us coming and hid something in a book... we got him out of there and dug around...
do you have it?
yeah. it is right here.
put it down on my desk blotter and do not touch it again. has anyone else handled it except you?
no.
how did you know 'broken mirrors?' bribe a cop?  tell it to the u.s. attorney, lounds!
what is it?
it is will graham...
well, it is about goddamn time!  i have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in atlanta and....
where did you get it?!
can you read it to me?
it is written on toilet tissue.  'my dear dr. lecktor, i wanted to tell you I am delighted that you have taken an interest in me. i know that you alone can understand what I am becoming.  'i know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what i am becoming.  just as the source of light is burning.  mr. graham, there is a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'i have a complete collection of your press notices.  i think of them as unfair. as unfair as mine. the "tooth fairy." what could be more inappropriate.  investigator graham interests me.  very purposeful looking. i hope we can correspond.  there is another piece missing here. I will read the bottom part.  'after i hear back from you, i might send you something wet.  signed: avid fan.  it has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
sarah, order a chopper. i want the next thing smoking and i do not care whose. ours. dcpd.  or the marines. then call documents. tell them to scramble a team. i want everybody moving in five minutes.  dr. chilton, please do not handle the note. i have a documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up.
after we have worked the note we want to replace it in lecktor's cell. i do not want him to know we found it.  where is lector now?
in a holding cell.
how long can you keep lecktor out without him getting suspicious?
three, four hours.
how long do i have?
twenty minutes max.
the main thing is: how was lecktor to reply.
that is probably in the part lecktor tore out.  at the top it says: 'i hope we can correspond.' and then the hole begins.  it looks like lecktor went over it with a felt tip pen and then folded it and pinched most of it away.
he does not have anything to cut with.
aniline dyes in the inks in felt-tip pens -- which is what lecktor has -- are transparent to infrared. the tooth fairy's ballpoint isn't...
that could be the tip of a 't.  here and here. and here.
at the end is the tail of what could be an 'r.
we know the tooth fairy reads the tattler. the stuff about me and lector? i do not know any other paper that carried it...
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in tattler.
personal ads?
the chicago office is running through all the personal ads in the tattler right now.
when do they go to press?
in thirty-five minutes.
christ!
not yet.
let's get to the physical.
if there is any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the smithsonian teeth. this is your boy...  he folded the bottom part, including what lecktor tore out. in this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions.  we can make out: 'six-six-six'.  i did not spot it until i had this high-contrast print. i advised chicago as soon as i saw it.
issue the toilet paper tear as a...
this is chester here. who am i talking to?
will graham, jack crawford...
we got an ad order in tonight's "tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. it is being telexed to you right now.
read it.
'dear pilgrim, you honor me.'
that is it. lecktor called him a pilgrim when he was talking to me...
'you're very beautiful.
...twenty-eight minutes.  cryptography at langley?
they got shot a telex. they are on if now...
no.  the numbers are not right for a jailhouse alphabet code. it is a book code.  and your message has to go out in it, or he will know it is not lecktor talking to him.
book code?
'one hundred prayers' could be the page number. the paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. but what book?
not the bible?
no. galatians 15:2? galatians has only six chapters. the same with jonah 6:8 -- jonah has four chapters. lecktor was not using a bible.
then the tooth fairy named the book in the part lecktor tore out.
right.  what about sweating lecktor?
they tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a princeton student.  he gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
it has to be a book the tooth fairy would know lecktor has in his cell.
he would know it from articles he is read about lecktor...
willingham, when he tossed his cell, took polaroids so they could get everything back in place...
have him meet me with pictures of lecktor's books...
where?
library of congress.
twenty-five minutes. we will not make it in time.
we let lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
can we still get lecktor's message out of the paper?
yes. and I am leery of running lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
and if we pull it, we lose a week... we only have two to the next full moon.
it is your call, will. what do we do?
run it.
what if it encourages the tooth fairy to do something besides write?
we will feel sick for a very long time.
who is it?
will, bowman just broke the code. it was a james beard cook book. you need to know what it says right now.
what did it say?
I will tell you in a second. now listen to me: everything is okay, I am taking care of it, so stay on the phone when i tell you.
tell me now.
it says: 'graham home, 3860 desoto highway, marathon, florida. save yourself. kill them all.  it is your home address, will. the bastard gave him your home address.
get me a plane...
wait, will...
get me a plane!
I will pick you up in...
i will not be here.
...sorry, molly. I am sorry this happened to you.
you did not do it to me, will; it is happened to us.  and if i survive the wallpaper we will be okay...  he is after you now, is not he?
it is a precaution...  why do not you run down to the bay. they got a swimming float.
I will hang around in here. I will just be in the kitchen, mom...
what is he? afraid to leave you alone with me now?'  he read the tattler piece, did not he?
he did not know you had been in a mental institution. be asked me if i knew. i said yes. i wanted to talk to him. he said he wanted to bring it up to you. face to face.
good for him.  thanks a lot, freddie!  kevin. we are going grocery shopping.
is there anything i need to know to see about mom?
no. you are very well-protected.  no one can find our where you are.
barry's mom had this newspaper. it said you killed the guy in minnesota and were in a mental hospital. is it true?
yes.
i figured I would ask you...
i was in the psychiatric wing. it bothers you, finding out i was in there... does not it?
i told my dad before he died, I would take care of mom. and I will do it.  this guy wants to kill you?
we do not know that.
are you gonna kill him?
no. it is just my job to find him.  i was in the hospital after garrett jacob hobbs.
how did it happen?
hobbs was insane. he was attacking college girls and he killed them.
how?
with a knife.  i found a curly piece of metal in the clothes of one of the girls. the kind of shred a pipe threader makes. i was taking a look at steam fitters, plumbers. it took a long time. in one place there was a resignation letter from a man named hobbs. i saw it and it was..., peculiar.  i was going up these stairs to hobbs' apartment. i was halfway up when he shoved his wife down at me. she was dying.  i sent the officer with me to call a swat team. but i could hear kids in there and screaming. i could not wait.
you went in the apartment?
yes. hobbs had one of his daughters from behind. he was cutting her. i shot him.
did the girl die?
no.
she got all right?
...after a while.
and hobbs died?
...yes.
what kind of coffee do you like?
huh?
you like that colombian stuff, do not you?
you remember when we first met?  and were together alone in that room. and the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. and then something flickered across your face like a shadow and i asked you what was wrong?
i remember.
do you remember what you said?
yes. i said this is too good to live...
let's go to bed. I will rub your back.
i need to talk to you about will graham.
what about him?
i need to ask you questions of a psychological nature.
remember when you asked for a study on him, i refused. same goes for now.
that was peterson upstairs.
it was you who did the asking.
he does not think you run mind games on him.
i would not presume to try.
you are never alone in a room with graham, are you? you are smooth about it, but you are never one-on-one with him. why is that? do you think he is psychic?
he is an eideteker. he has almost total recall.  but i do not think he is psychic.  what he has it empathy and projection.  he can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him.
why are not you ever alone with him?
because I am professionally concerned about him. and he would pick up on that. he is fast. he hates being prodded and poked.  so do i.  what do you want?
his nervous breakdown followed hobbs. could he kill again if he had to save his life? or would he hesitate?
I will tell you the events. the psychology's none of your business. hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. graham shot him with his .38 six times. hobbs still did not go down. he had to wade in...
that is when it happened?
no. it happened when graham went to see hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. she saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. she was connected up to a voice box.  when graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'why did you have to kill my daddy?'  that is when graham had his nervous breakdown.
what is the bottom line?
if he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  what are you planning, jack?
could he handle a direct contact?
i do not recommend it.
crawford has a proposition. i do not think it is a good idea.
if the tooth fairy listens to lecktor, he will come for me. so we are going to set me up as bait to draw him out. give him a clean shot.  that is what you were thinking, is not it?
what have we missed?
he may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. a fear of being gay. he objects to the word 'fairy.' plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on charles leeds after he was dead.  i believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in mr. leeds.
asian studies at langley said the mark you found on the tree is a chinese character considered a positive or a lucky sign in gambling. the character also appears on a mah- jongg piece.  it means red dragon.  that mean anything to you?
no.
...if he is smart he will approach from the front, pass, and take you from the back. how well do you hear?
pretty well.
I am going to spray your suit jackets. it will be invisible in this light, but you will stand out like a zebra for us.  they told me you checked out a .44 charter arms bulldog.
yes.
good. you will load these, ever fire them?
glaser safety slugs?
...commercially prohibited.  number twelve shot in liquid teflon in a copper casing. on impact it all opens up in the target. expect the recoil. they are hot loads.  body armor?
kevlar second chance.
i hope you have a second chance...
because he is gone for the head shot seven out of eight times'
you got it.
let's walk the route.
are you cold? would you like a blanket?
was i in an accident?
no, mr. lounds. you will be just fine.
my back hurts, my skin. did i get burned? i hope to god I am not burned.
burned? burned. no. you just rest there. I will be right back.
let me lie down.  listen, i want to call my office. my god, I am in a stryker frame.  my back's broken. tell me the truth.
what am i doing here?
atoning, mr. lounds.
do you know who i am, mr. lounds?
i do not want to know.
according to you I am a sexual failure. an animal, you said.  you know now, do not you?
yes.
do you feel privileged?
I am very scared.
do you pray to god, mr. lounds?
yes.
do you believe god is in attendance here, mr. lounds?
i do not know...
in a little while I will help you understand.
open your eyes, mr. lounds.
no. i do not want to see you.
mr. lounds, you are a reporter.  you are here to titillate your readers. if you do not open your eyes, I will staple your eyelids to your forehead.
look at the screen. that is william blake's 'the great red dragon and the woman clothed with the sun.'  do you see?
yes...
do you see?
yes.
do you see?
yes.
mrs. leeds harlequined with blood, her husband beside her. do you see?
yes.
mrs. jacobi after her changing.  the dragon rampant. do you see?
yes.
freddie lounds. your photograph. do you see?
oh, god.
do you see?
please, no.
'no' what?
not me.
are you a man?
yes.
do you imply that I am a queer?
god, no.
are you queer, mr. lounds?
no.
now you will read this into the tape recorder.
'i have had a great privilege. i have seen with wonder the strength of the red dragon. all i wrote about him before was lies from will graham. he made me write them. now i understand.  'will graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. because i was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'i will be a testament to the truth, now.  about his work. about his becoming.'
you did very well.  i apologize for the crude images.  next time I will have film stock that does not need lights.
you will let me go now?
you will tell the truth?
absolutely,
good.  we will seal your promise with...
can i have one of your cigarettes?
you have not smoked in two years.
I would like one of your cigarettes, please.
have you ever omitted telling me. things before?
no.
then why?
i wanted it over fast.  it felt dirty to not tell you.
can you quit?
no.
and... where are things?
where we are at is nowhere. we have nothing. we are running out of time.
what will you do?
i have to go back to birmingham.
is crawford going with you?
no. i have to be in there...  alone. maybe there is something for me if i know how he feels and thinks.
william: you are going to make yourself sick or get yourself killed.
you should go to montana. stay with kevin's grandparents. they have not seen him for a while.  I will come and get you afterwards...
will...
sidney: i do not understand him.  we know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  to witness the act. we know he thinks the act is making him into something different. his 'becoming'... but i do not know what it is he thinks he is becoming.  the answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. that is what is missing for me.  why the mirrors?
the usual motivation does not apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  i do not have an answer for you.  listen to me, my friend: leave this.
and do what? read about the next family in the morning paper?  in my monkey ward safehouse 'cause i can not take my family home?  this ends when i make it over.
how are molly and the boy?
kevin and molly are on their way to montana.  who the hell is he to do this to my family, sidney? answer me that...!
ms. mcclain, I am francis dollarhyde. i came about the low light level infrared film stock.
put your back against the door. come forward three steps until you feel the tile on your feet and there will be a stool just to your left.
can you give me an idea of the conditions...
shooting at maybe eight feet. i can not use any lights.
what is being photographed?
the activities of nocturnal animals.
when do you need it?
in eight days.
let me stick this in the black hole.
the 1000 c infrared sensitive film must be handled in total darkness. i keep the samples straight by touch code.  it is still easier to handle than a 1200 series. think it will do?
it will do fine.
I will take you.
no, thanks. i manage very well.  I will order you twelve hundred feet: of 1000 c tomorrow.
ride with me.
thanks, but I will take the bus. i do it all the time.
dandridge is a condescending prick. ride with me. it would be because i want you to.
come on in.  how about a gin and tonic?
tonic will be fine.
in the kitchen.
how did you come to gateway?
they had to shape up their employment practices to keep this defense contract.
you worked out well.
you know you speak very well, although you avoid fricatives and sibilants in your speech. at the riker institute for the blind. i trained in speech therapy for speech and hearing impaired children...
I will probably go back to it someday.
uh-huh.
ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is?
it is a surprise.
that was nice of you to think of that.
i made you a gin and tonic. it is by the side of the sofa...
is that you. d?
yes, are you okay...?!
I am fine.
good morning...  if you show me where things are, I will make us some coffee...
no! do not go back into the house...  it is too nice outside.
my sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. why do not you come, too?
i have work to do at the plant.
I will get my purse.
I will get it.  stay right here. you look very good in the sun...
do you want a coke or something, reba?
I am fine, francis.
you got the message lecktor called...
i arranged for him to have a phone. i have to call him in a few minutes.
from the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we have narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would have caught the 'tattler' early tuesday morning.
what is it narrow down to?
milwaukee, madison, dubuque, peoria, st. louis, indianapolis, cincinnati, toledo and detroit.
that is narrow?
when are you coming back?
when I am done.
it is will graham. is molly there, mr. swenson?
well, how you doin', mr. graham?! you sure are in the center of a storm. burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, i bet.  on the news they said he was a white man. he is not really, is he?
sure he is. blond.  probably scandinavian, too...
you going back down to florida after?
yes. is molly there?
my grandboy's been eatin' a ton of breakfast every day. been out riding. must be the good air. you oughta see that little booger eat.  I will bet he is gained ten pounds.  molly's out in the motor home...
i know... 'out in the good air...'
what is that?
tell her i called.
i wanted to congratulate you for the job you did on mr. lounds. i admired it enormously. what a cunning boy you are, will.
what do you want?
you know lounds's enlightened me on one thing: your confinement in the mental hospital. my attorney should have brought that our in court.
I am worn out with you crazy sons-of- bitches. if you have got something to say, lecktor, say it.
i want to help you, will. you would be more comfortable if you relaxed with yourself. we do not invent our natures, they are issued to us.  along with our lungs and pancreas and everything else. why fight it?
fight what?
when you were so depressed after you shot mr. garrett jacob hobbs to death, it was not the act that got you down. did not you really feel so bad because killing him felt so good?  and why should not it feel good?! it must feel good to god. god does it all the time!
i do not believe in god.
you should, will. god's terrific!  he dropped a church roof on thirty- four of his worshippers in texas last wednesday night. just as they were groveling to him and singing a hymn.  do not you think that felt good?  he would not begrudge you two measly murders.
why does it feel good?
it feels good because: if you do as god does, enough times, you become as god is: powerful...
they will find out about you.  they will lock you in a place worse than brother buddy's.
no.
they will make you be a piece of shit again. they will make you be a harelip again. you better give me what i want!
no!
she will fuck other people. pretty people. she will put in her mouth their...
shut up. stop. stop it.
you give me her and the shermans! you better give me both!
i want her! i want her alive...  I am going to keep her! you hear me!!!
reba...
francis? where are you?
the developing room.  i need to... see you.
i want to see you, too, francis... should i come over?
no. reba...?
are you okay...?
I will see you later. all right?
you will come by?
yes.
who is it?
it is me.
who?
me.
francis...?
he changes them into beings that accept him... and he needs to see the acceptance, in the mirrors.  i did not understand the mirrors before.  it is very important.
'changes?'
it is a word. killing them...  his delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  and he would record it somehow. so he can see himself received over and over again...
vtr, film, polaroid, stills, what?
how do i know?!
he is very careful, very... designed when he chooses.  if we find out how he finds them, then we will find him.
there is no connection between the families.
there has to be.
there is none! we have run it through the computer a dozen times.
he is a very shy boy...
what?
something lecktor said.
let's admit we struck out this month. the gulf stream's standing by. the basic lab stuff is on it.  you, zeller, jimmie price, a photographer. anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. we get the call, we roll. the scene'll be very fresh...
it is not over yet.
it is a foregone conclusion. for christ's sake, it is eleven pm.  the full moon is tonight.
will?
you wanna watch this or what?!
that is why the boltcutter.
what is that?
he used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. when he was watching from the woods. why did not he use it to go through the basement door?
because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed.
you mean jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered?
he had to.
it is getting late and...
do not talk to me!!
it is the guard in the storeroom.
we want the cans the jacobi home movies came in.  they are in the far corner of the room under the windows.
there is some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows.
what it is going to say on the jacobi film can is the same as it says on the leeds' film can: gateway lab, st. louis, missouri.
is there a label on the jacobi can that says what lab processed it?
no. it is bob's photo store in...
have him peel the top label back.
see if there is another label underneath.
it does, does not it?
i want a chopper on the roof in three minutes. to meigs field.  at meigs have them warn up and flight- prep the gulf stream.
am i alone in this room? are you here...  why are you doing this?!
some remarkable events have happened in birmingham and atlanta.  do you know what I am talking about?
two groups of people were changed. leeds and jacobi. the police think they were murdered.  do you know what they call the being that visited these people?  you can say.
the tooth...
it is dragon. dragon... red dragon.
francis did a thing for you today so i could not have you. and he was wrong.  i am the dragon!  give me your hand.
parking permits...
are your parking permits in the computer? he drives a van.
fogel has four more names. he knows two: both dark hair. third's a woman. fourth's a handicapped parking permit...
this is our boy...!
meet point's up ahead!
go on to the house.
lt. fisk said...
go on to the house...
will...?
what?
you are not going to need that. because we are going in careful and slow and secure a perimeter and a st. louis pd swat team is going to take him. not us.
get the roadblocks set on route three! there is an access road to the back of the house. that ought to be a second team's approach.  will graham and i are in an orchard due west of the house.
how far away's the back-up?
three minutes.
I will cover the back.
stay in the trees.
there is somebody in the house, jack...
wait for the back-up! will?
it is happening again, jack...
hello.
i was out in the garden. mama came out and told me when she saw it on tv. why did not you call me?
mama was probably asleep.
will? are you okay?
not too bad. I will be here a few days longer.  i want to see you.
i want to see you, too.
today's wednesday. by friday i ought to...
mama has all kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from cheyenne next week and...
come home with me.
will, they never get to see kevin and a few more days...
what is this mama shit?
it is what kevin called her when he was little...
what is the problem, molly?
i came up here after kevin's father died.  they were very supportive and helped me adjust. i got myself together. I have gotten myself together now, too.
small difference: I am not dead, yet.
will?  you could come up here.
they do not want me up there. every time they look at me i remind them... if they thought about it, they would want you. bur all they really want's the boy. and they will take you.  but they do not want to see me...
that is not true.
okay. they are full of shit and they make me sick...
maybe we should give it some time...
yeah. that is great. a little time.  i tell you what, buckaroo...  see you around.
what do you want?
are you george sherman?
yes. who are you?
my name's will graham. i...
oh, jesus... come in.  honey...!
we are fine. fine. we are all well. we are okay!  that man, crawford, called and... told me...  ...how 'bout a drink? coffee or something?
no, I am okay. i just wanted to...  ...stop by and...
i can not thank you enough, i...
let's forget who said what to whom...
you got a deal...
