...at the top of the stretch it is cozy girl in front with backtrack coming on... cozy girl by a length, backtrack closing...
come on. stay up there, cozy girl...
it is cozy girl holding on... cozy girl and backtrack...
I am en route. e.t.a. in five.
stay up there, girl...
cozy girl in front by a neck... now a head...
where is the damn wire?!
here comes the wire... and... backtrack gets up in the last jump. cozy girl a very game second.
shit!
hi, roper.
hi, kimura. where is the command post?
the suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. botched robbery. a teller hit the silent alarm. he took seven hostages. shot one -- the guard. he is still alive. so far he is asked for...
...a car.
that is right, and a plane waiting at the airport. if he doesn't...
...get 'em, he is going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
that is right.
what is the suspect's name?
earl.
hello, guys.
hello, roper. glad you could join us.
they are not usually graduate students.
swat wants to go in.
what is the rush? they have not killed anybody yet this week?
we got a guy who is probably on drugs. he is got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. but he is never been busted on a major felony. what is his demeanor?
well he is a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.
i have to go face to face.
no -- you can not do that.
you got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- we do not know how bad it is -- the guy ripped the phone out -- swat said he is got a gun to the head of a female hostage. if swat makes entry now, you are going to lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. i got to go in. maybe i can see what is going on in there.
i do not know.
he is never offed anybody. his rap does not show any violence.
not that we know of.
we do not know how much time we have. if i can get in to talk to him -- maybe we will not lose anyone.
maybe we can get a throw phone in there.
where is the car?
i need to get something straight first.
it is my job to see that no one gets killed, earl... including you.
then where is my fucking car!
really?
absolutely. bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
the old guy? what kind of show of faith is that? i want debbie.
am i gettin' the car?
you are gettin' the car.
what?!
you want a convertible or hardtop?
manual or automatic?
automatic.
you got it.
this baseball player you are going out with...  he is no good for you.
really?! he is a wonderful guy. he makes two million a year, and he worships me.
i worship you.
you worship yourself.
ronnie, forget this what's-his-name.
greg.
did you know he is already got a bad knee? in another 10 years you are going to be pushing him around in a wheelchair.
you know what i think? i think you only want me now, because I am with somebody else.
who cares what you think. i want you back and that is all that matters.
let me take you out tomorrow night... pleeease.
I am going out with greg tomorrow.
this greg is really getting in my way.
please. I am begging you.
oh, I have got to get a shot of this.
floor seats.
you are my hero.
dinner's on you.
deal.
tell him to give me a raise.
he says, "thank you very much."  I will discuss it with him right now... good-bye, chief.
roper.
what?
are you going to make this hard for me?
depends. what is up?
there is been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
define concern.
what if you die and no one can do what you do as well as you do it?
your concern is heartwarming.
it is been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
is that what the guy in the sunday school suit is doing outside?
his name's kevin mccall. every metro captain agrees that he is their top sharp-shooter and most likely to succeed.
great, send him to the marines. this guy's not a negotiator. he will quit in two weeks.
you let us worry about that.
is there going to be an expression of your appreciation?
what kind of appreciation are we talking about?
the financial kind. i figure I am going to be working extra hours. all sorts of overtime... training sessions... not to mention the extra stress...
what do you think would be in order?
like ahh... i do not know...  five thousand dollars.
okay, i think i could swing that.
and a car.
hey, you just got a five thousand dollar raise. get a car of your own.
you know you have got nothing but cars down there in impound.
impound is not a rent-a-car company.
the car is part of the deal.
what happened to your trans am?
repoed this morning.
I will provide you with transportation.
and even if this does not work, i want all the money. these swat guys do not have the temperament. they do not have the background...
same here. I have watched you in action. very impressive.
you have got a lot of hard work ahead of you if you want to be a negotiator.
I am ready to do it.  and I am going to be here more than two weeks.
do not go reading my lips, man. that is an intrusion. save that shit for the sniper school. comprende?
sorry... habit.
we are already past it, are not we, kevin?
if you say so.
you ever been in a hostage situation?
only at the very end.
how do you feel after a shooting.
like it had to be done.
it rarely has to be done.
I have rarely shot anyone.
swat is a lifesaving unit, you know.
i know.
try to remember that.
what is the point of this?
a little exercise in lateral thinking. the obvious solution is not always the only solution... see you tomorrow.
mind if we make a stop on the way? we busted frank antonucci on possession. he gave us a lead on that polk street jewelry heist.
"phoney frank"? do not waste your time. he would tell you his granny was in on the kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
i still gotta do it. wasting time is half my job.
yeah, okay.
this swat guy might be a good idea. he may be able to take a little pressure off you. i worry about you.
you worried about me, too? the chief's worried about me. solis is worried about me. maybe you guys should start some kind of organization.
speaking of which. i saw you talking to ronnie this morning. why can not you get it back together with her. you have got to be out of your mind not to get with that one.
it is not me. it is her. she is going out with this baseball player -- greg barnett.
no shit! he is good!
fuck him. he swings at anything in the dirt. i could strike him out.
do not give up on her. you are getting to the age when you ought to be thinking about these things.
where is the stereo?
fuck the stereo. what is that smell?
come on. just get in. we gotta go.
apartment 306.
you want me to go up with you?
nah, it probably will not turn up anything. I am just going to talk to him.
good. i do not want to be late.
what is the line?
it was warriors plus 6 this morning.
I will take half of your action.
who is it?
it is lieutenant sam baffert from the san francisco police department.
what happened? is there a problem?
may i come in? i would just like to ask you a couple of questions.
duke ellington. "things am not what they used to be", recorded july 30, 1945.
yeah... yeah... now i can hear it.
where did you find an old recording like that?
used record shop down on turk street. i was in there looking for some robert johnson.  memories... memory lane or something...
I have got to stop in there... mr. korda, do you know frank antonucci?
you mean frank who owns the bakery down the street?
could i please have a little water?
of course.
perhaps for his own reasons he entangled me in this... situation.
this cousin of yours... what is his name?
clarence teal.
the chief says to tell you how sorry he is. he knew sam baffert was a good man.
he said he was just going up to talk to him. he said...  i want to be put on this case.
i can not do that.
i want to be put on this case.
you know i can not assign you to this. you are much too close to it. you were much too close to sam. the department will take care of it.
who is running it?
roper...
who is running it!
kimura and glass will head the investigation.
anything on korda so far?
solis said to keep you clear of this.
hey.
hey yourself. came by to see troy.
a little late for that, scottie. he is asleep.  jack daniels?
I am not drunk. yet.
maybe you should be.
you heard.
yeah. I am sorry.
can i come in?
that a new picture?
about 4 months old. I am working in a new style.
i will not stay long. i had to talk to someone.
you do not usually talk to anyone when you are hurting.
it was my fault. i was right downstairs. i should have gone up with him.
scott, you can not save everyone.
I have proved that, did not i?
oh, hell, forget it. this will not work.
what do you want from me?
something i guess i can not have anymore.
do not try to make me feel guilty. the whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you did not need me. now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. i can not do it. i can not be more than your friend. because i know what will happen. in a few weeks you will be back on top, and you will shut me out just as soon as you do not need me again.
you think i did not need you?
if you did, you never showed it.
ronnie...
you told antonucci that shit came from me.
so that we could get the best price. he is got respect for you. he is going to try to lowball me, mike.
you fucking idiot! why do you think i use you?... to be a walking advertisement.
I am sorry, mike. i never heard of lamarra flipping on anyone before. he said he had the cops paid off. antonucci never flipped on anyone before. he had the cops paid off.
not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
what happened, mike.
you do not want to know.
god damn it! i still needed to case that fucking store. it is too risky to show my face now.
i got a couple thousand bucks. you could leave town.
leave town? they are going to know me in fucking des moines now!...  they got over ten million in jewels in that place. that is freedom, man. i could go anywhere i want.
what do you got on korda?
we ran a search on relatives. he has a cousin in town -- clarence teal. smalltime thief. last known address was on pine street. he moved out a month ago. we have got a couple leads on him to check out.
did you check out dmv for any vehicles registration?
being faxed over now.
how about the record room for any incident reports? he might be a victim. we can get medical records. check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.
roper...
and what about bars? we can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
roper, we are into it...
I am sorry about your friend. i had a friend in swat killed. i know how it can be.
i appreciate your concern. let's leave it at that.
so, mccall, how come you ended up in san francisco?
they recruited me. promised me fast advancement.
recruited you from where?
national marksman competition.
with your qualifications you must have had a lot of offers. why here?
furthest point i could find from new york.
you do not like new york?
spent my whole life there. i just wanted to get out for a while.
you would never been out of new york?
been to toronto. my mother was born there.
how did you like toronto?
it was okay.
you are a real excitable sort, are not you?
you caught me on an "up" day.  how about you? how did you end up in san francisco?
i grew up in oakland... crossed the bay bridge and here i was.  so you are looking for "fast advancement".
is there something wrong with that?
I am not sure.
roper. metro division. hostage negotiator. give me the short version.
husband came home. found that guy and his wife "in flagrante". now he is holding her at knife point.
which apartment?
how are we gonna get him out of there?
we could fill it with water.
have you evacuated anyone?
only that floor.
is the hostage injured?
do not know. she keeps screaming to stay out. he keeps screaming to stay out. we decided to stay out.
well, there is a good amount of agreement on that.
i know how you feel, ray.
you do not know shit, and i suggest you leave.
i can not leave, ray. it is part of my negotiator's oath. once I am in the room with the hostage, i have to stay.
you do not want to see what I am going to do to her.
let me show you something, ray.
same thing happened to me, man. she cheated on me, but i forgave her. you know why?
i am not interested in your life story.
because i was partially to blame. i was not around as much as i should have been. i forgot how to love her.
she is the one to blame. not me.
ray, think about how she looked when you married her. think about how happy you were. do not lose that, man. do not give up everything.
what am i giving up? I am laid off last year. I am down to my last unemployment check. I am out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
ray, if you walk out of here with me, I will get you a job.
doing what? cleaning toilets?
i can not guarantee you what it will be. but i swear on my life, I will find you work.
and why the fuck would you do that for me?
not for you, ray. for me. a close friend of mine was killed this week. the way i figure it, i stop you from doin' what you said, I am one up on body count.
who the fuck are you, mother teresa?
my name's scott roper.
eighty-five percent of domestic disturbances of this nature end in murder/suicide.
not the ones I am at.
come on. let's go for a drink.
i do not really like to drink.
you have to. it is a tradition.
well, if i have to, i have to.
you got a girlfriend?
why? you like my ass?
you would not want to put a small wager on this, would you?
i do not gamble.
yeah, I have got a girlfriend.
you living together?
she is back in jersey... going to graduate school.
explain how that works.
she is going to come here when she graduates and then we are going to get married.
she grow up in livingtston, too?
no, no, no...  she is from hoboken.
oh, "city girl". do not you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in new jersey?
we see each other every couple of months.
every couple of months, huh?
that is a lot of commitment. i admire that.
do you really?
no. actually i think it is fucking crazy, i do not know if i could do it.
thanks for clearing that up.  i hear your former girlfriend is going out with greg barnett.
where did you hear that?
around. barnett's tough competition.
yeah, well that is a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.
lesson two, "dead eye"... should have been lesson one. never exchange yourself for a hostage.
i think i can handle that one.
yeah, you think so, but it comes up.
you think you can learn, mccall?
i think so.
first things is, do not say, "what's going on?" everybody knows what is going on. i come into this situation, i say,  "i'm glad to see nobody's hurt. that is good. I am here to help you."  second: you hesitated. do not hesitate. if you are thinking, talk while you are thinking, or else he is going to think you are plotting. which you are. if he thinks you are plotting, you are going to make him nervous. you do not want him nervous. got that?
no.
it will come. try again.
tell me what you need.
i need you to bring me the scumbag who ran off with my wife so i can cut off his nuts.
i can not do that.
then get out of my face you worthless piece of frogshit.
nah, i just throw that in because i enjoy it.
so what do i say to this guy?
you could say something like,  "tell me what the scumbag's name is. maybe we can work something out."
what? bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
if you want to be a successful negotiator, you have got to learn to lie.
I am not good at lying.
get good at it.
it is against my nature.
you know the ten commandments?
yes.
what is the first commandment?
thou shall have no other god before me.
you tell me.
thou shall not kill... you have killed, right?
yes.
why?
to save lives.
so why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?
my name's mccall. I am unarmed.
okay, stop.
what did you see?
a dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. a berretta nine millimeter in his belt. a female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. a female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there is a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.
why did he do it?
because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... we had a plan, but swat opened up too early. he got caught in the crossfire.  let's move on... notice this. always use the eyes to keep the connection. it almost like hypnosis. that is the most important thing. create a connection. you are always on their side...
you know why i like the track?
you are a compulsive gambler?
see the favorite? tail up. washy. he does not want to run today. cross him off... now the six looks good. on his toes. coat shiny. this trainer/jockey combo does well. we can not leave him out.  what do you think?
i have two words for you... seek help.
i have three words for you... ex-ac- ta.
i bought you a four-six exacta box. you owe me twenty bucks.
i do.
we need the 4 and 6 to finish to first and second.
fine.
ronnie... yeah, so.
now she is going out with greg barnett?
so what do you want?... an autograph.
i do not know why she would pick him over you.
I am just practicing my lying.
still needs work.
you are right. I will never be as good a liar as you.
the 6 horse is last.
that is okay. that is his style.
to run last?
to run late!
the 6 horse is still last.
he will be running at the quarter pole.
they need to run first and second?
yeah, first and second.
come on russell!...  who the fuck's russell?!
the jockey!
come on, russell!
we won!
we lost.
we won.
how much you wanna bet?
you want to bet on whether you won your bet? this is getting sick.
how long you been coming here?
about six years. my partner took me.
is it always like this?
occasionally you lose.
see this. solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. probably worth thirty.
police corruption. it is everywhere.
what do we got?
32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. a unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
any verification on numbers.
we have only seen and talked to one suspect. he calls himself "joe". there is two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. this particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. they have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit did not just wander in. they knew what they were coming for.
what have you promised them?
just that I would talk to my superiors.
you do not have to come here.
yes, i do. that way there is no misunderstandings. i need to make sure no one's hurt, then we can take care of business.
alright, roper. you want to come... come.
good. i will not be armed. we got to operate on trust here. we are going to wrap this up and have you guys out of here as soon as possible.
are you in charge, roper?
yep.
i want a car. like a four wheel drive. i want it in perfect condition. i want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. i want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. then we will come out. i do not want any remote control devices in it. i know all the tricks. if it is not in perfect condition, and i mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I am going to kill somebody and we are going to start again.
i want a plane waiting at the airport. I will tell them where i want to go when i get there.
is that all?
for now that is all.
you will get it. but, joe, i want you to do something for me. let me take a look around inside. make sure everybody's okay.
no. you just do shit for me right now.
joe, I am doing a lot for you. i think you could give me something to cement the deal... one hostage.
I will give you something.
there is your answer. he is smart.
he is cutting down the visibility.
and doing a very good job of it.
he is got the girl.
damnit!
are these yours?
yeah, they are but...
come on!
what the fuck is going on.
i do not know, but I have got to get on there.
you are crazy.
pull up alongside.
you can not kill me like this.
what if you and me got into a struggle... and my gun went off?
i wanted to get this out of the way.
you got a bet on the game tonight?
as a matter of fact, i do.
it is already started.
i was going to catch the last half on tv.
that kind with the garlic and the oil that i like so much?
no. the kind from kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
I have been craving that stuff all week.
and it is hard to get.
what do you think?
mmm, needs a little something.
what are you talking about? this is it. this is the stuff right here.  well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
yeah that is it.
why do not you just stick your finger in and stir it up.
scottie...
scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. you came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. but i did not even know what happened... 'til i heard it on the news the next morning.
it is because i wanted to keep you away from that world.
it is not that world. it is your world. it is part of who you are.
veronica, it is not easy for me... i do not know if i can change overnight. but what I am telling you is that i want to share everything with you, because i do not ever want to be without you again.
what about greg? what are you gonna tell him?
it is okay. we broke up.
when?
just now.
you got to do this for me. I am in here because of you.
man, what is this about? ya know, you were robbing a store. it was not personal. it was his job.
fuck you! you know what he did to me?!...
do not make do it, mike.
are you going to turn on me too? who helped you when you were strung out? who gave you money? who bailed you out of jail?
i will not get away with it.
nobody knows who you are. make it look like a robbery.
how is paco doing?
he was going nuts at the park. he met this very attractive poodle. they made plans to meet again next weekend.
i... I am kevin. i 'm here to help you, d... dave.
you can not help me, man.
who is controlling your mind?
whoa!... the government. they control everybody's mind. you are too fucking stupid to know that?
this has nothing to do with walter.
they want walter dead!
tell me what is wrong.
particles, man. i feel them all the time. i feel them in my arms and legs man, that is how they punish me.
how can i help you with the particles?
it is not just the particles man, it is the whole fucking machine, this is how they get assassins to operate. it is been this way since the cuban missile crisis.
they have less power over you if you look into my eyes.
huh?
tell my dad.
tell him what, what do you want me to tell him?
tell my dad I am sorry about the watch.
I will tell him. where does he live. we will get him on the phone right now.
i hate fucking springfield.
is that where you are family lives?
it might have happened no matter who was up there.
bullshit! would it have happened to you?
maybe... there is one thing you have to remember... you do not create the situations. you can only try to save people from them.
i thought i could do it. i was so damn sure of myself. but i did not know what to say. the words would not come. my mouth turned to mush. you make it look so easy, roper. but it is not. it is not easy.  it is a different job than looking through the rifle scope.
that it is.
how many have you lost?
i look at it as how many I have saved. that is the way you have got to look at it.
and what about the ones you do not save?
you live with it... and they haunt you. it does not leave.
and what if you can not live with it?
you have got to decide that for yourself.
you like this place?
it is very nice.
i guess you realize that there is something special that i want to talk to you about.
there is?
for the last week things have been going pretty well between us. i think we have been doing a good job getting intimate and all that stuff...
yeah?
...let me just show you.
who are you again?
johnny hawkins. bail bonds. i gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
johnny who?
hold on a second here.
is there a problem?
you signed out twice.
i what?
look, why do not you just come on back inside for a second.
wait a minute, lemme see that.
how come in those foreign movies the young girl is always with some fat, old guy.
in europe women find older men very sexy.
korda escaped.
and you think he'll...
i do not think you are old and fat enough for me.
use your imagination.
why do not you come back up with me, ronnie.
i think I will stand out here in the sun.
he is going to kill her no matter what. if i take him these jewels he is going to kill me and her.
so what do you want to do?
that is a chance i got to take.
then we better get moving... but there is no way we can get the jewels out of evidence.
mare island is an abandoned shipyard, cranes, high buildings... he will be in place where he can see everything.  how are we going to get me in there?
good question.
open your shirt.
I am not wearing a wire. this is just between you and me.
shut the fuck up and do what i say!
satisfied?
open the bag, dump everything on the table.
it is all there.
spread it out.
I am impressed. i did not think you could do it. what did you have to do, steal them?
yeah.
that is not going to look too good on your service record.
I will worry about that. let's get on with it.
scottie, scottie...
it is all over, babe, it is all over.
stay here, do not move.
scottie...
do it!
mccall, you all right?
I am okay. korda... went down the side of the building...
stay put.
I have never seen sea so blue. tahiti is magnificent, scottie.
yeah, i could get used to this paradise shit.
scottie?
hmm?
I have been thinking.
hmm?
things have been going pretty well between us, have not they?
yeah.
you have changed you know. i do not think there is anything you can not do once you put your mind to it.
i was just thinking...  there is something special i want to talk to you about.  i think it is time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  a deeper level.
a deeper level?
that is right. we have got to bare it all. here and now. 'cause i think I am finally ready to go for it...
whoa! wait a minute, ronnie. hold on. i know it is beautiful here. the sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. but we have got to keep our perspective here. this place is not real. this is not reality.
scott...
i mean i said this trip should be a 'roadtest'.
...the hell are you talking about?
I am talking about... what are you talking about?
I am talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in tahiti'.
you talkin' about gettin' 'nekked?'  shit, i thought you were talkin' bout, you know... the "m" word.
you thought i was talking about getting married?!
you crazy? with all those people around?
know what you are?! you are a prude, roper.
the hell i am!
prude.
first you want me to put on one of those skinny ass bathing suits -- tongs or thongs or whatever you call them -- with my butt cheeks wrapped around a piece of dental floss... no way.
