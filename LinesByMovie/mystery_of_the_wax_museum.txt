you are too gracious. these things have some merit, i suspect ... but this--  ... i am convinced, is fine.
even those delicate veins, the texture of this flesh -- i have never seen anything more exquisite.
my partner believes that i should build a horror chamber, immortalizing the hideous crimes and criminals of london. at such times marie antoinette has reassured me, she has promised me recognition for the devotion i gave to her.
she will undoubtedly keep her promise. if you'll grant me the privilege, i'd like to submit this work to the royal academy when i get back.
you will have won the undying gratitude of us all.  is that not so, marie antoinette?
i regret i can't spend the time i'd like with your exhibition, but i'm going to worry the life out of you when i come back.
it will always afford me great pleasure to see you.
good night, sir.
good night.  and i am very grateful to you.
i came back for some of the books. i am trying to straighten out the accounts. i don't hope to impress you, but i may as well tell you: we haven't a farthing!
that is unfortunate.
your money may have been well invested, my friend. something important may come of all this.
something important has got to come of it! do you know that the rent on this place isn't paid?
is that a fact?
no -- i'm lying to amuse myself!  now look here, i've an idea that will get us out of all this. we haven't twopence between us, but we've got these.
fire insurance!
yes, there's our way out. a fire in this place would give us ten thousand pounds.
a fire! is this your idea of humor, my friend?
i want the money back i've thrown into this rubbish heap.
you are asking to burn these people ... you are asking? ...
i'm not asking you anything. i'm telling you what i'm going to do!
and you think i will permit this, my friend?
you've got to permit it! whose fault is it that no one comes here? the museum at walston lane does well enough, and why? they've got jack the ripper, burke and hare, the mad butcher, the demon barber of fleet street and things people pay to see.
and they are welcome to them. to perpetuate such creatures is to celebrate their crimes.
well, what do you think i'm in this for?  think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
you're insane.
not at all -- let me show you how easily it can be done.
where'd you get the stag hound?
he's not a stag hound. his name is kelly and he's a police dog.
what do you mean police dog?
plain-clothes man.  come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to washington ... a fate worse than death.
listen, flo, cut it out. hard-tack is pretty sore.
ain't that something. the mad monk of manhattan. here goes nothing.  listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
as i live and breathe and wear spats ... the prince.
been doing experiments with scotch and soda again?
where did you get the news item?  from a little bird?
yeah.  have a pleasant vacation?
charming. more delightful people crippled.
great. consider yourself crippled -- financially. see if you can jar your charming friends loose from enough to eat on.
meaning what?
that you're a sure bet to place in the bread line. there's no room on this rag for the purely ornamental. you're easy on the eyes and pretty conceited about it.
i'm through clowning. you're all washed up. get out!
what do you mean, you poor ham! this is new year's!
all right, what about it? we get out a paper just the same. did you ever stop to think of that?
well, is it my fault if nothing happens?
and how does one go about getting these human documents, may i inquire?
that is none of our business.  but you bring me something for the next edition if it's only a recipe for spaghetti!
quick, watson, the cookbook!
i told you he was a sore.
stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. all i have to do is get a story.
here's a wow.
call the homicide squad!
how's every little thing?
fine. you're the first reporter in here for two hours. you people seeing the old year out?
i'm people which the old year saw out. i'm canned, fired!
no kiddin'.
i've got to make news, if i have to bite a dog.  hey, kelly! oh, mi gosh, even he walked out on me.
i've got a story for you. you know the joan gale girl?
yes, she committed suicide yesterday. that's not news. i heard about it last year.
oh, yeah? maybe she didn't commit suicide. she may have been murdered!
no foolin' -- any suspect?
do you know george winton?
old howard winton's cub?
that's the one.
they don't suspect <i>him</i>?
don't they? he's down at the tombs right now.
say, if you're stringin' me, old-timer ...
why would i string y'? they were sweeties until a month ago.
what does that prove?
nothing. only she may have tried to blackmail him. you know such things have happened. anyway, he was at her apartment a few hours before she was found dead.
hotcha! saved, one job!
make it snappy, colonel.
there's an autopsy ordered at bellevue immediately. you better skip over there.
don't give this to anybody else, will you?
it's all yours.
thanks.
yeah. i suppose you people will crucify me for something i didn't do.  i didn't! you understand that! ... i didn't do it! she -- tried before --
come on, old man, that won't do. you know you're innocent until proven guilty.
yes, sure, that's fine. while i'm proving my innocence, you people are going to uncover every petty kid trick i ever did ... you're going to write editorials about every cocktail i ever drank. anything that any sane, normal person might have done will have a sinister meaning, if i did it.  go on! get out! i don't want to talk to you!
listen, kid. you're in a tough spot, and you can make it a whole lot easier for yourself if you cut out the cry-baby stuff --
cry-baby?
that's what i said.
my lawyers will be on the job in a little while, and i warn you people anything you print about me you've got to prove. dad won't stand for--
your dad has stood for plenty. now let's get down to cases. when did you see the dale girl last?
for a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
hmmm. why didn't you tell that to the police?
they didn't give me a chance. we had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. she seemed happy.
uh-huh. do you remember what she said? what did you talk about?
she laughed and told me that we were being silly, that we didn't care for each other any more but we needn't hate each other ...  ... she said she wanted to be friends.
i see. was that all she said?
we planned a trip for her. i was going to send her to bermuda.
you weren't going with her?
no.  why didn't i take her out somewhere? but she was laughing and seemed so happy.
well, let's get back to the case in hand. they ordered an autopsy and discovered her body had been stolen from the morgue.
stolen! what are you trying to do to me? ... you're working with the police! ... you're trying to make me say something that can be used against me! you're trying ...
hold on, hold on. i'm trying to help you, if you're on the square, and i think you are.
then why are you telling me a crazy lie? ...
that happens to be the truth.
who'd steal her body?
that's what they're going to ask you.
well, ain't that a shame. nice little chappie that wouldn't harm a fly ... everybody picking on the little fellow.
if this kid was some unknown soda jerker, they wouldn't have pinched him. but he's george winton and they're playing him up. it's a roman holiday for every paper hat editor in new york.
why the goose pimples? if he wasn't social register -- if it was somebody like me, you'd be trying to hang him.
i wouldn't be trying, beloved. i would hang him! and another thing, all this gaga about the body disappearing. eight bodies have been stolen in new york within the last eighteen months. doesn't it seem more reasonable to hook this up from that angle?
and ruin a perfectly good story? don't be silly.
no, i mean it. i think this kid's entitled to a break.
he's getting a break, ain't he? he's front page.
you give me a pain!
i'm glad to hear it. when did you go in for crusading in the cause of justice? this lousy mug, with all the money in the world, has had two or three nasty affairs. he's kept out o' print because his great- grandfather was smarter than the indians.
well, anyway, he couldn't have copped that body -- he was in jail.
you don't think he'd be sap enough to do the job himself. i hope they give him the works. even if he didn't kill the kid, he's responsible for her death, and they can fry him any time without making me sore.
well, i won't work on it from that angle.
oh, you won't -- you were pretty tough about judge ramsey -- a little while ago --
and they never proved anything against him.
except that he disappeared when things got too hot.
or was bumped off by someone who was afraid of him.
whooey -- he took a run-out powder.
well, that's got nothing to do with this case. can i handle this my way?
you cannot. i'm still editor of this sheet.
all right, you said i was fired. well, i quit! give the assignment to somebody else.
hey, come here, sob-sister!
nope, i'm through!
on the square, jimmy, if you'd seen winton down there -- i'm not holding a brief for him -- maybe he's a dirty pup, but he's scared and hysterical -- and so kinda dumb and worthless ...
great! ... if he's worthless we'll give him away as a bridge prize. come on -- beat it. it's five o'clock. you need some sleep.
no, there's another point i want to iron out.
sleep on it ... we'll get it tomorrow.
which one is me? the horse?
get out of here.
if my curiosity is not too great, would you mind telling me what manner of animal this is you are designing?
one of the maids-in-waiting for that elizabethan group.
and he isn't struck dead! this man, he lives! it would be interesting to know, young man, where and when you studied anatomy.
that doesn't seem so bad to me. what is wrong with it?
everything, my friend. and you hope to be a great sculptor --  a great sculptor. look -- this forearm is at least two inches too long.
but the composition as a whole -- i've tried to keep a sketchy freedom.
if it is freedom to represent people with limbs that don't match -- cripples -- you have achieved your purpose. anatomy! heaven forgive you. you must have studied with a sideshow of freaks!
have you got it? is it completed?
yes, sir, it's here on the truck, but it's pretty heavy -- i'll need help.
otto! you and one of those other fellows! come help professor darcey.
shall we unpack it?
yes.
i'd be glad to, mr. igor.  i think i'll have somethin' to tell you soon.
you have done well, and now i, too, have something for you. come.
yes, why?
i wondered. did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
i wish you wouldn't be so sarcastic about ralph. he's the sweetest kid i know.
what are you laughing at?
i just had a picture of you telling a landlady some day that you didn't have the rent, but ralph is awful sweet.
i don't see any big-moneyed boys running after you.
i met one last night ... all the money this side of peoria.
did you? where?
in the can.  the hoosegow! mrs. winton's little boy. the pawk avenue wintons, you know ... and plenty of do-re-mi.  he's in the jail-house now ...
i don't have any affairs. what do you mean?
i don't think you could have a real affair. you couldn't care for anyone.
i've been in love so many times my heart is calloused ... but i've never hit one with dough. this love-in-an-attic isn't my idea of a way to spend a pleasant afternoon.
i don't agree with you.
all right, you raise the kids -- i'll raise the roof. i'd rather die with an athletic heart from shaking cocktails and bankers, than expire in a pan of dirty dish water.
you would.
he can look like a chimpanzee and act like an igorot but he must have dough -- plenty of dough.
you think money is the only requisite. it happens that the poor people are happier.
then marry ralph ... you'll be the happiest couple in the world.
to lunch.
to lunch, you say. i am having coffee and sandwiches sent in. we are not leaving until we have everything ready for the opening.
but i have some friends waiting.
that is unfortunate. they will have to wait.
i will only be gone about half an hour.
if you leave before the work is done, you will be gone for a much longer period ... you will be gone for good.
all right, i'll tell them. they're right here in front.
fine, thanks.
gee, honey-bunch, i'm sorry -- i'm going to have to disappoint you.
don't worry -- she'll get used to it.
disappoint me? why, what do you mean, dear?
well, you see, the old chap is pretty anxious to open on schedule. all of his advertising announced the opening tonight.
he might get some publicity out of it.
no use. he's a crab, i tell you.
who? old santa claus there? that's easy for anyone with my sex appeal. he's a pushover. watch me stand that old dodo on his ear.
nix, flo -- he won't let you in and you'll only get me in dutch.
horsefeathers!
why, certainly, sir. my fiance. charlotte, may i present mr. igor.
delighted, i'm sure.
if you will forgive this poor, crippled stump, my dear, i am very happy to know you.
thank you.
although you would be amused if i were to tell you that i knew you before you were born. before this terrible thing happened to me ...  ... i made a very beautiful statue. even if i had not met with this disaster, i could never have hoped to do anything finer, probably nothing quite so fine. and, my child, you are that figure come to life. i wonder, some time, would you pose for one of my sculptors who does very excellent work?
i'd love to, at any time.
we'll be coming to the opening.
at any time. you will always be welcome.
but what about lunch?
i'll have it for supper.  so long.
she is the soul of that statue.
i wonder if i could have her pose for me.
what are you laughing at?
he can't hear you.
come in, prussic acid. what's on your mind?
i want to see the original pictures of joan gale.
hey, mattie, dig into the morgue and send up all the art you have on joan gale.
well, why so mysterious! come on, spill it.
so you can give me an argument and tell me i'm wrong. don't be sil, kid.
i am right! i know i'm right!
well, no one would ever suspect it. you don't sound right.
listen, jim -- and if you wisecrack while i'm talking i'll crown you with the inkwell.
all right, wise guy. go ahead. spill it.
jim, there's a little hokey-pokey wax museum opening up down on 14th street.
now don't that call for an extra!
i asked you to keep your trap shut!
well, you can't blame a guy for getting a little breathless with a scoop like that.
all right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
no kiddin'. what's your idea?
just this -- i got a look at that dump a little while ago and if they haven't got a wax figure of joan gale in that line-up, then i'm crazy.
we'll grant that.
what!
about the gale girl, i mean. where do we go from there? what of it?
listen, jo-jo. does this mean anything to you? joan gale's body swiped from the morgue -- did you ever hear of such a thing as a death mask?
i used to be married to one.
and it came to life and divorced you. i know all about that. now my idea is this: somebody swipes the girl's body, takes impression, makes a mold, produces wax figure ... bingo! ... peddles it to this old skate down there!
work that up into a comic strip and syndicate it.
let it go.
come down to earth. do you think they would dare do anything like that? don't you think they'd know that figure would be recognized? shake your head real hard -- you'll be all right.
all right, master mind.  but there's something cockeyed about that joint and i'm going to find out what it is.
oh, by the way, another pet theory of yours just blew up.
what do you mean?
that dear, innocent judge ramsey that you were so sure got bumped off for knowing too much has been located in south america.
no kiddin'?
almost certain.
almost! i'll still bet i'm right, and let you write your own ticket.
yep. everything settled.
good. well, i'll be seeing you.
i'm glad they didn't hold you downtown.
they didn't have a leg to stand on. there's no case against me. it's a clumsy thing to have happen, but nothing to worry about.
well, any time i can do anything for you --
thanks.
there's no hurry. it's early.
i can't convince the inner woman that we can wait. she's howling for a bit of ground beef before we drop in on santa claus and the other dummies. i've only had a cup of coffee since last night.
why didn't you eat last night?
ouch! eat? you can do a solo if you don't step on it. i'm going to bow out on you.
what's the rush? there's no first act. they'll all be there and we don't have to appear at any particular time.
i'm hungry. i'll eat the first child i see. and i've an appointment with young winton at 8:30.
you wouldn't get mixed up with that little rotter, would you?
no? give me a chance, baby. money is music in my ears, and when his old man kicks off there'll be a million dollar tune.
if you're going to be indiscreet, i wish you'd be a little more discreet about it. rich men, like winton, love you and leave you.
yeah, but they leave you plenty.
i think so.
well, thank goodness, that's settled.
i'd know him anywhere.
don't lose sight of him. this is the most important thing in my life.
i wouldn't feel too disappointed at the slimness of your audience tonight, mr. igor. the weather was against you, and the people are tired and getting over their celebration and preparing to go to work tomorrow.
quite so. quite so.  and you, my little friend, my little marie antoinette. it is kind of you to be present.
but i think these things are beautiful.
they are.  my boy, i think you are right. everyone is tired out today and now that we have seen my doors open in a new country, i am beginning to realize that i am a little tired myself. you can call that fellow in from the front. i think we'll close for the night.
but why? she's the best friend i've got.
she isn't anybody's friend, and i don't like you living with her. she's a bad influence.
nonsense. she's one of the nicest girls i know.
what's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
i won't let you say that!
well, i do say it.
she thinks it's funny to talk the way she does, but--
don't kid yourself -- she means it.
are we going to have the same quarrel over again?
i'm not quarreling, only ...
you wouldn't have said that before you met her.
i'd call it stupid at any time.
well, that's just how stupid i am. when you go riding, it will be with me. and if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
so that's the way it is?
that's the way i feel about it.
i'm glad you told me. good night, mr. burton.
now look here. it's not up to us to do our own detective work. i've had enough trouble over this matter. i don't want anything more to do with it.
not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
not even then. the police are the proper people to conduct this affair. now if you've got any suspicions i'll drive you to the nearest police station.
what! and let every rag in town grab a red-hot story? not so you could notice it! now, look, i want you to drive me around the corner and wait for me.
i told you i didn't want to mix in it.
all right, brother. then you can go to some nice warm place, and i don't mean california.
please. i'm sorry. i'll see it through. what do you want me to do?
i told you what to do. drive around the corner out of sight of the house. i want to get a closer look at the place.
what! what are you talking about?
the body of joan gale!
hello, express. what's the idea, trying to outsmart the police?
i'm not kidding. joan gale's body is packed in the box in the basement, and i saw the most horrible thing down there.
are you giving me this straight?
don't take my word for it. get down there yourself and give a look.
listen, copper, get a load of this. while you're chinning yourself on a bar rail, i run down this story ... my story. consider yourself my assistant.
what do you think i am?
whatever you are, you're the only one of it.
it happens that i'm the law.
how quaint. but i can go any place you can.
not a very good one, i guess. he wasn't like anything human. he hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse i got of it in the light from the street, was like an african war mask.
you mean he was colored?
i don't know what he was, but he made frankenstein look like a lily!
there she is! you'll find joan gale in that box.
no -- no -- i -- i -- i don't want to see it.
hey, what do you think you're doing? put that stuff back!
nothing doing. this is my percentage. you birds are going to get yours. and anyhow, i found this dump.
why?
you go in for dangerous things.
darned if i don't!
--and so determined to live that i'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
i suppose this is going to sound absurd. i've only known you twenty-four hours, but i'm in love with you.
it doesn't usually take that long, but i'll forgive you -- you were in a tough spot when i met you.
no, really -- i'm crazy about you.
oh, is that what caused it?
you don't believe me. you think i'm just talking. will you marry me?
how much money have you got?
heaven knows. a lot.
well, that being the case, i'll take it up with the board of directors. hey, listen, aviator, here we are!
mit me, kid. i've got a classic.
you here again like an evil spirit to mar my happiness?
this one's a story, but i'm not going to tell you what it is. every time i tell you anything it goes haywire.
what do you mean -- haywire? you start out after murderers and come back with three-for-a-dime bootleggers. you start to solve murder mysteries and break up crap games. you're grand! i'm for you! stupendous!
say, you're always razzing everything i do, but this is one time i'm in.
go on, little girl, take your troubles somewhere else. i don't feel like talking to you.
was there any art on judge ramsey?
what goofy idea have you got now? don't tell me you suspect judge ramsey of stealing the body.
i'm going to make you eat dirt, you soap bubble! i'm going to make you beg for somebody to help you let go!
yes, sir. i got in the cab and it was layin' there on the floor.
where were you going when you got in that cab?
i don't remember. not so very far--
don't remember what day that was, do you?
no, sir. about three months ago.
you didn't happen to be going to worth's place, did you?
no, sir, i'm sure it wasn't there.
you used to go to worth's place a whole lot. what makes you sure it wasn't there?
well, maybe it was. i don't remember.  you got to do something for me, i can't stand it any longer -- i can't!
oh! mr. igor! -- i'm so glad you're here -- i don't know why i should be, but i was a little bit afraid.
oh! so, my little friend, you have honored me by accepting my invitation of last night.
no -- i -- wanted to speak to ralph. we had a silly argument last night and i said something unkind.
oh, you children, you happy children. you've quarreled and now you're going to be friends again. and that is as it should be. never let any stupid misunderstandings come between you.
but it was really my fault.
and he will probably demand the life of anyone who agrees with you. let him think it was his fault ... he should be along very shortly .. . but be very stern before you forgive him, especially if it is your fault  ...  while you're waiting for your friend, would you like to see some new figures i have downstairs?
i'd love to.
oh, please, mr. igor, i'm terribly ashamed. i shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
it is no trouble at all, my child. this is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty i used to create.  my footing is not too secure.
let me go! let me go!
we have found immortality, you and i. you must not be afraid.
ralph! ralph!
what are you people doing out in the middle of the night?
i'm after news, as usual. i wonder if it would be all right for me to slip in and look around your factory?
i guess so. but wouldn't it be better for you to wait until the old man's here?
well, i'll tell you a secret. i kinda like the old gent and i'm trying to build a special sunday magazine story out of him. it might help him a whole lot. but that's a side issue -- something i do on my own time.
gee, that's great. after the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. this will pep him up. have you told him about it?
no. i wanted to do it without saying anything. i think he's worth it.
ralph, come here a minute, will you?
better cut that out.  that's what happens to girls who bite their nails.  what's wrong?
you killed him!  come on with the rest of it. you killed him!
no -- i didn't. it was igor at the waxworks.
but you were in on it -- you worked for him.
no -- the only thing i did for him was to keep track of the man named worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
you lie!
it's igor at the wax museum! you'll find your judge embalmed in wax! he's a statue of voltaire, with all the other corpses! the whole place is a morgue -- do you hear? -- a morgue!
please, oh, please, i haven't done anything to hurt you.
and i have no desire to hurt you. you will always be beautiful. think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
what is it? what happened?
don't ask any questions. come on!
listen, stupid, could i do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
yes, you could. cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. marry me.
that's what i said.
i'm going to get even with you, you dirty stiff! i'll do it!
