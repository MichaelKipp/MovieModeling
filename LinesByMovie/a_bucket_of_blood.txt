walter, what are you doing?
i was just looking at carla's picture.
well that's not what i pay you for, now is it?
well i was uh, just looking...
well do some looking around the room. i see cups, ashtrays - let's go...
ah, your new head shot...  i like it, very much...
do you have to be so cold to him?
how ya doin'?
uh, hi.
alright we're clear.
anything new?
not really.  one girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
is the manager cooperating?
yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. that's about it for tonight.
alright i got you, man.  it's my turn for freak patrol.
you know it.  i'm out of here.
i don't think anyone gets what i said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
i liked it very much mr. brock. i liked it very much.
well i'm overjoyed.
"let them die, and by their miserable death become the clay in his hands, that he might form an ashtray or an ark -"
that's word for word.
is it?  i've forgotten.
i thought you believed that life is a homeless traveler riding on the rtd of -
i know that - i know that! i also believe in burning the creative candle, you understand, down to the end - to be uncreative you might as well be dead...a walking machine, toiling in a factory!
i worked in one of them.  back in alaska.
it's our road kill series.  i take the pictures.
i do the research.
are you done with these?
yes, get rid of them...
oh, hello mrs. swicker.
hello walter.  i want to tell you the super fixed the leaky pipes and sealed up that hole in your wall.
oh, ok.
walter you look awful pale! what did you have to eat today?
i had a salami sandwich, mrs. swicker.
if you were my son...why don't you let me fix you a nice hot bowl of soup, it won't take but a minute.
oh no, that's ok, i can fix myself something.  besides, i got something important to do...
uh, no, i didn't see him at all.
what's got into that cat?  well if you do see him, tell him i've got a nice fat piece of ocean-fresh halibut for him -
t-tell him that?
if you see him.
ok mrs. swicker.
good night walter...
good night, mrs. swicker -
i'm trying to find a style of my own.  do you really like them?
oh yes...very nice...very, very nice...
hi walter...
what are you doing here so early?
well i brought something, i wanted to show you.
what is it, your laundry?
huh?
don't worry about him...what have you got?
a thing i made.
where'd ya buy that?
i didn't buy it i made it.
you...made that?
i said i did, didn't i!
i've never seen anything like this, maybe segal, but nothing with such... dichotomy...  it's very good, walter -
honest?
dead cat!
dead cat?
yeah.
well it sure looks dead enough.
you want to buy it, put it in the club?
you want me to buy dead cat?  it'll scare people away.
well...why did you put a knife in it?
i didn't mean to.
got carried away, huh?
alright, i'll tell you what.  i'll put it in the corner of the alcove. if it sells, we'll split it fifty- fifty.  how's that?
sure!  so i guess that means i'm an artist after all.
maybe so...
i wouldn't give up your day job.
all that is comes through the eye of the artist...
alright get a grip on yourself now since you're here why don't you start early, the kitchen needs cleaning.
sure!
you really like it?
of course...it's wonderful.
people seem to like my cat.
enough already about it - get to work!
i saw your...cat.
did you like it mister brock?
call me...maxwell.
yeah, can you say plagiarism?
not only that, he copied us!
i get it walter.  i get it.
what do you get?
your work, the layers of irony.
what the hell's going on?
everyone wants to meet the bus boy.
what did he do?
he made a cat.
see you later -
righto.
did you hear that mr. de santis? everyone's really crazy about dead cat.
yes they are, aren't they?  look, why don't you take the rest of the night off, you look tired.
well i don't know -
no, it's ok...you came in early.  besides, you're creating an incident. when people are applauding they don't order anything.
well...
look, go home and...work on something. make another cat.
i don't have another cat!
well make a dog, make a parakeet! i'm sure you'll think of something.
a parakeet?
go home.
ok...good night mr. de santis!
good night walter.
hello mayolia.
walter, you did something to me with your work tonight.
with dead cat?
with dead cat.  like a breath of fresh air.  i could just - babble on about it for hours.
really?
it's like...you've turned on.
t-turned on?
a hot light bulb is burning inside of you.  i want to be warmed by it.
that's really nice of you mayolia.
let me into your world walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
i can't.  i gotta go home.
well, i'll go home with you.
oh no, i couldn't do that.  mrs. swicker would start asking questions. she's my landlady.
i don't think so mayolia.
i want to be part of it, i want to inspire you, i want to do - something!
you don't have to do anything!
then let me give you something then...
i want you to have it.  there's a little something for you in here...
gee.  thanks.
let it inspire you.  maybe it will let you think of me.
hello, walter.
hi.  i know you!  i've seen you down at the jabberjaw plenty.
yes, you have.  can i come in?
uh, sure.
i was going to make some pancakes, you can have some if you like.
hm.
did you see my cat?
yeah i did.
i also saw the girl give you this.
oh yeah that was mayolia, she's a nice girl.  she's kind of strange, though.
you like chasing the dragon, walter?
chasing the dragon?  whaddya mean?  you sure you don't want a pancake?
you can cut the crap.
police officer.
you're like an undercover guy!
you're in some deep shit pal, whether you know it or not.
huh?!!!
possession of narcotics isn't something we take lightly, you understand?
but i got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  yessir, i think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  why don't you tell me about your connection.
c-connection?
i'm not looking to pinch you!  i don't care about you, or the girl.  but you want to save your ass, you better start telling me what i want to hear.  now!
telling you what?
who's the head honcho!  who's providing the smack connection!
smack?
goddammit, where are you from, mars?
alaska!  what the heck's wrong with it!
haven't you ever heard of smack! horse!  junk!  heroin!
is that what that is?  i never seen any before.  i always thought that stuff was expensive!
oh, yeah.  it can get real expensive.
who do think you're dealing with, huh?  i'm willing to cut you a break, chief!
you are?
good ol' mild mannered walter! give it up.  it doesn't fly with me.
i- don't know what you're talking about!
you're coming downtown with me, walter.  you're gonna come clean with me, you're gonna name names or i swear to god i'll see to it personally you rot in a cell upstate! are we understanding each other?
wait a minute!  what'd i do?
i got you cold, pal.  make it easy for yourself, use your head.
i didn't do nothing wrong!  that was mayolia's!  i didn't ask her for it.  i don't know about any -
yeah yeah yeah - look!  i've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! lou goes to turn walter against the wall but walter springs back -
wait a minute - i told you i didn't do nothing wrong!
don't give me a hard time walter! you don't want to get me mad!  you're coming with me!
i ain't going no place with you!
you're gonna shoot me!
turn around!
what are ya, deaf?  turn around!
no! no don't shoot me i don't want to get shot!
relax!
you're gonna shoot me!
walter shut up and relax!
no you're gonna shoot me don't shoot -
what's all the noise in here!
noise mrs. swicker?  what noise?
don't tell me i didn't hear a racket!  i'm an older woman and i don't need to be upset and disturbed in this manner!
i was just straightening up the place.
straightening up indeed!  are you sure you're not alone?
i'm always alone, mrs. swicker, you know that.
walter have you been talking to yourself again?
well yes i guess i have been mrs. swicker.  somebody's got to.
she doesn't have to be pretty... just as long as she takes good care of you...
uh, i can take real good care of myself, mrs. swicker!
uh, mrs. swicker i got to meet some friends later, and i have to take a shower!
well why don't you clean up this dump!
i will - good night mrs. swicker!
what's the matter with you!
look at that, man.  big deal.
i know.
i mean it's like, you know, i do my art because that's what i am, you know?  i'm an artist.  i'm not like a banker, you know.  like i create.
i know, man.
but it bugs me when someone rips off our ideas, our concepts, and people freak out about it, you know, and tell us ours stinks!
i know, man.
i mean, screw them, you know?  i'm just gonna go right on creating 'cause it comes from here -  you know?
i know, man.
i wonder what his deal is.
i think he's looking for you, man... it's all finally catching up with you!
h-have a seat?
have a seat -
i thought i'm not supposed to sit with the customers...
now why shouldn't you, walter? things are different now...
they are?
you've arrived.  you've been recognized.  you're a talent, a creative force to be reckoned with.
leonard, what are you doing?
hiya carla.
what am i doing?  i'm just telling walter the truth.
you know what that proves?
what, mr. de santis?
are you trying to be funny?
i'm totally serious!
the question is what are you going to make next, walter?  did you make that dog yet, or that parakeet?  how about making something out of the cockroaches in your room?
i-i already got a new one!
great!  what is it?
it's a...full length life-size figure!
what's it called?
murdered man.
murdered...man?...
when do we get to see it? walter well...any time, i guess.
man that's a trippy name, kinda like the warhol mayhem series...
i saw a statue once called the third time phyllis saw me she exploded.
now what kind of statue was that?
i don't know it was made out of driftwood and dipped in sulfuric acid.  it was out there...
well...why murdered man?
i don't know, it just happened, i guess.  i didn't mean to.
you didn't mean to what?
well, i mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
it's called spontaneity, leonard. get with the program.
yeah it was all just an accident.
are you alright?
yes...i'm uh...i'm fine.
i tried to contact you by phone but i couldn't...
excuse me i have to make a call...
i want that cat.  i'll pay you one thousand dollars - cash.
i'm trying to reach lieutenant beldere...
what offers have you got for it? i won't be out-bidded.  i'm a wealthy man and i don't mind paying for something i want.
i can't talk right now.
what do you want for it?  two thousand? three thousand?
no...look i'm busy...
listen to me...i don't want to lose this piece -
i'm holding for lieutenant beldere!
listen to me, listen to me...i've been collecting art pieces all over the world for years and let me tell you something.  this newcomer walter paisley has it, whatever it is, the x factor, that indefinable quality that separates the greats from the hacks, and i want that cat in my hands.  are you listening to me?
can't you see i'm busy here?
yeah, i'm feeling a lot better.
listen, i'm going over to walter's after the place closes.  i want to get a look at murdered man.  do you want to come along?
look at the size of it!
it's not really that big i got it on kind of a stand...
let's see it.
uh, well, i'm a little nervous, i never did a person before.
you can do anything you want if you set your mind to it.
it's hot in here...
you want me to open a window or something?
like it?  it's a masterpiece.  i've never seen anything like it before... and i hope i never see anything like it again. walter smiles and looks at his creation -
me too.
how did you ever find it all in yourself, walter?
it wasn't easy.
what's the matter with you?
nothing...nothing at all.
i've never seen anyone so... squeamish.  well, what's your opinion, leonard?
don't ask.
oh come on!  even you can see its value.
well then admit it, it's a work of genius.
i admit it.
no.  why don't you cover it up walter...
why not?
why don't you cover it up, walter!
what's wrong with you, why do you want to hide it?
well, i've been thinking...  i didn't realize how much...talent walter actually had.  it would be wrong for us to show them one at a time.  dead wrong.
you're right.  we should build a collection first.
a show?!  like this sunday?
n-no!  not exactly, i mean you take years and years...
it will take years to make that many statues.  but your work would be featured.
that's the idea, walter.  it's the only way to gain recognition. all the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
yeah then you could unload - sell this stuff for a lot more.
a show..how soon can we go?
these things take time walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
carla and i will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
abstract?  with his talent for realism?
you see the direction his realism takes! it's unhealthy!
gee..twenty five dollars for something i made!
now you're a professional!
there's that weird dude again.
man if this place doesn't cool out i'm gonna hang out somewhere else...
hi walter.
carla...
maxwell.
i see the rewards of achievement have come your way.
man look at that get up !
looks like that cat paid off in spades.
let's check out the scene.
don't you work here?
not anymore!
and what project looms on the horizon, walter?
uh, i don't know.
would you like to do me?
i just might.
i'd be glad to help.  for $50 an hour.
would you pose for me for free?
well, it all depends, leonard...
man if you want to be a legit artist you have to do nudes, nudes, nudes...
right.  ain't no body of work complete without some... nudes -
that's not true i am a sculptor!
oh yeah?
if you were an artist you could have created something!
i'm going home!
what are you doing here?
i wanted to apologize for being nasty to you this evening.
listen schmuck, why don't you get out of here and let me go to bed!
i didn't finish talking to you!
well i'm done talking to you, what do i have to do, draw you a diagram!
i decided to make a female figure after all!  i want you to pose for it.
well i'm touched.  you're serious, aren't you?
yes.  fifty dollars an hour, right?
yeah.
tonight.
what, right now?
uh-huh.
it's kind of dark -
shh!
i'm almost ready -
sit in this chair, and i'll pose you.
that doesn't look like very much clay.
oh it's enough...
are you nervous, walter?
n-no...
not even a little bit?
i already told you i'm not.
when's the last time you had a totally nude girl in your room...
um...
without a stitch of clothing on, sitting and facing you...
a girl with a body like mine?
you're breaking my concentration!
walter can i ask you something?
what!
are you a virgin?
it's just an innocent question.  besides i just wanted to clarify your intentions.
whaddya mean?
well i just wanted to make sure you know, fully and completely, that you're never gonna get any from me, at least in this lifetime.
look -  this pose is all wrong!
i'll pose any way you want.
here you go, enjoy.
i hope this was made with egg whites!
it was.
what's this sauce!  i'm lactose intolerant.
don't worry it's a non-dairy sauce made from soy milk.
hm.
hi.
good morning walter!
these guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
oh...
wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  join us?
no thanks.  sounds good though.
suit yourself.
what's up, walter?
i came over to see you.  i brought something...i wanted to show you.
oh yeah?
yeah.  can some of you guys help me?
is it murdered man?
better!
man this is heavy!
yeah what's this, murdered elephant?
put it in the middle of the room!
when did you make this, walter?
walter...i can't believe it.
i'm honored to know this man.
you think she's better than murdered man?
well i can't say that walter!  she's incomparable.  they're both great.
more champagne, your majesty?
here here...
where where...
there there...
may i please have another little kiss?
walter!  jeez!
sorry...
what did he say?
didn't you hear him?
no man i'm on my own plane.
did you hear what he said?
yes walter.
all about me...
it's true, isn't it?
every word...
you better hold off on the bubbly.
yeah, why?
you might talk too much.
yeah and what would i say?
i know what it is to be ignored.
tell us what you're going to make next, walter.
i'm gonna make the most wildest wittiest things you ever seen... gonna make big statues and li'l statues, tall statues n' short statues...
an' everyone will say walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
here here!
hello leonard!  beautiful morning, isn't it?
it was.
what do you have in the box?
just wait till you see this!
whatsamatter leonard?
you made...a bust... walter  yeah isn't it wonderful?
whatsamatter leonard?
put it down, walter.
walter...walter listen carefully.  i don't want you to make any more statues.  do you understand? no more statues.
well why not?  i gotta make statues leonard.  you heard maxwell, they want me to make them.  i can't go back to being a busboy!
maxwell!  he's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  listen, you've got to stop right away!  i'm beginning to feel responsible!
well, w-what did you do?
never mind...
when carla comes by i'll talk to her.  she'll make up some nice invitations.  we'll have them printed up.
yeah?
well invite the critics, and the art collectors...we'll tell them...
after that we go no more!
hiya maxwell.
i won't say good luck, walter.
why not?
it would imply you could not succeed on your ability alone!
i mean, you look so pretty.
thank you.
are you ready?
ready?  we've got plenty of time.
i know.  but i wanted to talk to you.
goodbye.
bye!
man, why do you suppose walter wants to get her alone?  you suppose he could be physically attracted to her?
no man, he ain't the type.  he don't get enough vitamin e.
maxwell gave him a bottle of wheat germ oil.  maybe he started taking it.
nice night out...
hm...
well...what did you want to talk to me about?
well...w-what kind of people do you like, carla?
oh, i don't know.  smart people. creative people i guess.
you think i'm creative?
of course i do!
that means you like me!
i like you very much, walter.
i thought you did on account of you kissed me the other night!
well that was for your sculpture of the girl.  your nude in the chair.
carla -
- even though leonard's always asking you to go out with him and i - just -
what are you trying to say?
uh...  ...how long have you been thinking about this, walter?
oh...f-for a long time.  ever since you first came to the club.
but you gotta love me!  why do you think i made that statue of alice?!
walter, i'm sorry...
you just can't be sorry! i wanna - i wanna marry you!
now calm down walter!  now, let's go in there, and when the show's over, maybe we can talk about it.
no! i want to talk about it now!
walter...  i don't want to hurt your feelings but there is no way we're ever going to get...together.  you know what i mean?
why not?!
because...  we're just friends.  that's all. just friends. walter i get it.  i see the whole thing now. no one knows if walter paisley is born!
jeez, what is your problem all of a sudden?
oh sure, let's string along poor walter, see how far it will take us!
why on earth should you be so depressed?  have you heard some of the things they've been saying? you can make fifty thousand on these pieces alone!
i thought you didn't respect money!
i don't!  but fifty thou?  that's not money, that's manna!
i'm sorry about what i said before.
forget it.
i've been thinking...  carla, would you do one favor for me?
just about anything, walter.
would you let me make...a statue of you?
would you really like to?  that would make me very happy.
ok...tonight.  i'll make a statue of you tonight, ok?
that's alright, we got a pressing engagement!
yeah, right outside the door!
walter...there's...
what?
there's...a body inside that statue!
walter...stay away from me!
don't you see carla?  i made them immortal.
