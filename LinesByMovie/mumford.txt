i have eighteen more minutes!
i don't want to hear any more today.
why not?
mr. follett, do you trust me or don't you?
well, i don't know... i only been seeing you --
without trust, there's no point to any of this. you might as well not come.
now hold on, i didn't say i didn't want to come --
good, then go.
you're early... it's not ready. what happened?
my patient had to leave early.
who was that?
does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, lily?
i think it's like... inquisitive.
it was henry follett.
man, you see him a lot. and it's very wrong to reveal it. next you'll be saying what his problem is.
what do you want to know?
you're terrible. i'm never telling you anything.
how long you been in this town?
oh, i don't know...
four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long.  and you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
lily, i don't think even you could know that --
you know who that is, don't you?  you really don't? that's skip skipperton, man. he gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
oh, so that's him? the panda man.
so, what makes you so popular? what's your secret?
you like me. how come?
not sure. let me think about it.
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "naomi forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. but while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets chandra. and it's serious, immediate love. so in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in north america.
what do you mean, "in no time"?
in maybe three or four issues.
weekly or monthly?
monthly! god, how shallow do you think brad is? why do i waste my time telling you this stuff?
why do you think you tell me, nessa?
don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
it's a big part of the show.
the school board doesn't pay you? what kind of deal is that?
it's called pro bono.
pro boner?  pro bono, huh? for whose good, supposedly?
it's my bit for the community.
fuck the community.  there was this article my friends and i read. it was "25 signs he's great in bed". it was very fascinating.
where was this?
where?... the new york times. the first one was -- "he handles produce well." which we already knew!  the point is, you have a lot of the signs.
you been spying on me in the supermarket, nessa?
have women found you attractive?
i knew you wouldn't answer. i've been thinking about what you said last time. how me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. how maybe i can't lose the weight, ever...  which we already knew...
that's not quite what i said --
it's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something...
you're doc mumford.  skip skipperton.
how are you?
fine. okay. pretty good. i've been hoping we'd meet. i've heard a lot about you.
..."find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- i guess a lot of dads say that -- but i did and it just took off.
no kidding... panda. where'd that come from?
panda? i've always liked giant pandas... i've been to china and seen them in the wild. that's the kind of thing i can do if i want... now. i can do pretty much anything i want to do these days.
would you like another beer?
nah... scotch.
far out. single malt?  can i pick it?
can i ask you a personal question?
of course! that's exactly what i want.
have you thought about getting a wife?
i gotta pee.  can i ask you something? this town is called mumford... been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! right?  now here's the question -- your name is mumford, too.
is that the question?
you moved here from back east and your name is the same as this town. is that right?  far out.
i hope you don't think i want you to do this for free. just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean i won't pay you like a doctor.
i understand.
i have a lot of money. do you know how much money i've got?
don't tell me, 'cause i'm not going to tell you what i've got.
i've got three big ones.
i'm impressed. i couldn't make three million dollars if i lived three lifetimes.
no, no... i have three billion dollars.
-- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? how 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district --
-- go on!
-- you crazy? you can't do this!
sure i can, lionel.
i'm a criminal lawyer -- you think i like my clients? i can't stand most of them! but i don't kick them out...
see that sign -- we retain the right to refuse service to anyone. i'm not going to charge you for this session, but i don't want to see you back here.
don't you at least have a back door i can use?
come out this way. there's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, althea?
maybe some of us don't need this crap!
and it's the hubble telescope, not the himball telescope.
what do they want from me?  what have i done that's so wrong?  they act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... they do! believe me. everybody's got something...  even you probably have things.
me more than most.
why are they ganging up against me?
i'm not sure. but i think they're worried about you.
it's the kids, you know, not jeremy. he had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. he's always willing to pay. he's extremely generous.  i'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
how did they threaten you?
they said if i didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more.  what do you think about that?
good kids.
mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
hmm?
i said... you must come out to the house for dinner on thursday.
really? you think so?
yes. jeremy will be home for the weekend. and you can meet the kids.
how ya doin', ainge? evenin', lily.
doc.  ainge...
dr. mumford.
mr. cook.
could you come with me please?
i know i shoulda come to your office. i was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
uh-huh.
it's my daughter sofie... she's gotta problem.
what's that?
we're not sure. she's been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they've said different things. some of 'em are callin' it --  -- epstein-barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... chronic fatigue symptom...
syndrome... chronic fatigue syndrome.
that's it -- syndrome. so you know all about it?
no... a little. there's a lot of debate about it.
yeah, i got that. some people think it's all in their heads.  it's been so bad she's had to move back here to mumford and live with us. and i'm not sure that's the best thing, either...
why's that?
oh... a lot of things. several different factors. will you see her, doctor mumford?
sure. why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
i'm not sure she'll come. she's in a mood. do you ever go to somebody's house?
generally that doesn't work out so well. it sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
hello, lionel.
you've got to have the right ladder for the job. you don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
you're right, as usual. see you.
what an asshole!
ernest, what do you think?
i think he's got a point.
this is great!
this is exactly what i wanted.
skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
you'd be surprised. most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. they're busy. it's not as easy as you think.
skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. are they busier than you?
well, you know... that's the thing. like i said, just about everybody in town works for me. and it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. it's like an order or something... and no one -- no one -- asks me.
so, would you say we're out here... let me think how to put this... is your problem really that you're... lonely?
don't you like this?
hell yes, i like it. what's better than this? most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
okay then.  have you got a lot of friends?
lily and i talk a bit. you know lily, runs the coffee shop?
no... i've seen her. good-looking woman.
she's probably ten years older than you.
good-looking woman.
lives downstairs from me. she's got a great dog named for danny ainge.
really? i'm the only person i know that likes danny ainge, outside of celtic fans. maybe phoenix.
well, there's lily.
did you know that danny ainge was drafted by the blue jays? do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the nba and in the bigs?
amazing.
unbelievable...  ...and lily named her dog after him? far out.
what kind of person do you have to be to do this?
what?
this --
so i guess henry follett is a patient of yours. he's my pharmacist.
yeah.  guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
pretty good, too. lots of detail. nothing hard core. old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
uh-huh.
problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. nothing can live up to it. his wife got sick of it and left him. took his kids with her.
i wondered what happened to her...
feel free to lie down. most people do.
i'd better not, i'll fall right to sleep. i think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
what can you tell me about this?
oh, lord. it's almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. i didn't really want to come. i'm not hopeful right now. but i couldn't take the look on my dad's face. he's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. he's the opposite of me, i guess -- all stamina and resolve.
when did you start to feel this way?
about six months ago, i guess it is now. god, it seems like years. what a bore! i'm embarrassed by it. before this happened -- when i'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- i thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
what?
you think that now! you think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
no.
i saw it. i saw it in your eyes.
that's okay. maybe it is. my mother always says -- "everything that's wrong with you is in your head." i suppose that's true.
back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? a change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
no... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. that's not too suspicious, is it?... but it wasn't like i was feeling bad about the divorce. just the opposite.
hmm.
hmm? is that a professional opinion?
hmm, as in -- that's interesting. sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out.
even if you don't think it's real?
i don't know what's real and what isn't. that's never been my strong suit. but if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. maybe i can help you do that.
what would you do?
we... we would try several things. but i need to see you a lot.
i don't know. i barely made it today.
i'll come to you. we'll try a little walking.
we'll take it slow. you'll never feel you can't handle it.
i don't think i can afford it. i don't want my dad paying.
we'll work it out.
you have the best answer for everything.  you seem so... hopeful. are you always this sunny?
no one ever thought so. you must bring it out.
is it contagious? 'cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
maybe you'll catch it.
can i ask you something?  didn't you tell my dad you didn't think it was a good idea to come to the patient?  so what changed?
you must be dr. mumford of mumford. jeremy brockett.
doc. nice to meet you.
sorry i'm late... traffic was a motherfucker. have another drink, i'll be back in five.
i think you'll like this. know much about cuban cigars?
nope.
are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
i've had my moments.
i am. and i'm not ashamed of it. nobody ever said on their death bed -- "i treated myself too well."
i thought it was -- nobody ever said, "i should have spent more time at the office."
fill in the blank. i don't mind the office. the point is, you only go 'round once. like the zens say -- be here now.
what do you do?
althea hasn't told you?
we've been talking about her, mostly.
well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. we've got twenty-three people working there now.
you've done well.
we've done... very well. you know anything about addiction, doc?
a little.
well, i'm addicted to winning. i say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score.  so what do you think?
tastes good.
no... i mean about althea. about her...  ...behavior. do you think you can fix her up?
what do you think's wrong with her?
she's gone weird is what's wrong with her. out of control. probably from living out here in mayberry.
you're the doctor, what do you think?
she seems very unhappy.
but you know how to drive?
sure.
got a license?  but no car?
don't need it.
i just got my license two weeks ago.
you're good.
i been drivin' since i was twelve.
that would explain it.
can you help mom?
i'm trying.
got to.
what's wrong with her?
is she a friend of yours?
no... sort of. man, she could be cool, but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys. she's blowin' them in the parking lot.
do we run into the street? no, i didn't think so.  nice car. how's that place?
it's a pretty piece of land.
and the brocketts?
horror show. what'd you do tonight?
it was insane here, man. 'hadda call in the national guard.  then i did my laundry... watched 20/20.
...and?
shocking. did you know the government is wasteful?  you heard it here first. oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
why do you watch?
no gentleman caller, doc.  not that i care. i've had it with men. they're so fascinated by their own crap. took me four years to get the last one out. almost turned me into a dyke... these days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed. now that feels good. and you don't have to do all that... listening.
i'm not making any promises.
we'll turn back anytime you want.
oh boy... this should be interesting.
hello, mother. i want you to meet dr. mumford.
mumford... like the town?
what's happening here?
we're going for a walk.
do you think that's a good idea?
dr. mumford does, yes. i've put myself completely in his hands. for today, anyway.
what kind of doctor are you?
ph.d., psychologist.
oh... not a real doctor.
that's right, the fake kind.
mom's such a cutie.
people usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
she's not in a bad mood. she's like that all the time.  it doesn't bother me anymore. it's my dad and my brother i worry about.
maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.
is that the technical description of what i've got?
is she against you getting help?
we don't discuss it.
something's bothering her.
oh, we've all disappointed her. me, especially, but dad, of course. she thinks my brother's all right, but she didn't expect much. it's what happens when you "marry beneath yourself"...
please... forgive me.
what?
negative thinking makes everything more difficult. if you're going to have enough strength to do this, we have to talk only about positive things. all right?
okay then... are you positive your mother's a bitch?  just kidding.
you've got a funny idea of funny.
i've offended you!
no.
really? what would it take?
is this the treatment?
sorry... i'm done.
'cause i'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.
i'm embarrassed. the list is so long.
be specific.
well... i'm tired all the time, obviously. i always feel like taking a nap. but when i try to sleep, i have trouble.  my muscles ache. and my joints. i feel like an old person, or like i did back when i used to work out too hard... what else?...
sore throat?
uh-huh.
painful lymph glands?  forget fulness... irritability... depression?
yes, yes, and definitely yes. also... i get confused.
yeah, most people have that. it's confusing here.
where?
life.
i don't know if i mentioned the headaches.
did you get headaches before this?  but you get more now? or more severe?
no, not really. they're about the same. my marriage was one long headache.
so the headaches may not even be a part of this?
i can give myself a headache instantly.
is that like a party trick?
all i have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... like i'll think -- 'taking these walks is going to help sofie get better.' but then i'll also think -- 'mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you're kidding yourself about the benefits.'
there... i've given myself a real whopper.
you actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  so you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. it makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
or maybe it wasn't an accident at all --
mr. follett.
-- 'cause in that instant i saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and i knew --
henry!
what?
stop now.
why? i'm paying for this.
not for this. not me, you're not.
you find it distasteful, don't you?
it doesn't matter how i feel about it. it's how you feel about it that matters.
i enjoy it. does that make me some kind of pervert? just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
you didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination.
no?
you came because it's taking over. you're in its grip.
i never said that.
where's your wife, henry?
go to hell.
i didn't hear you.
we got divorced.  i had to get rid of her. she couldn't satisfy me.
what?!
i was... never satisfied.
now we're back on track.
what's that?
you are so mean.
hey, skip.
doc. i know we're not supposed to get together till wednesday...
that's all right. what's on your mind?
how many sessions have we had now, doc?  six. and it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. just shootin' the shit.
yep.
i want to tell you something, doc, but before i do, i need to ask you a question... because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, i haven't told anybody about this. it's the biggest secret i've got.
sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
you're a shrink, doc. aren't i supposed to be able to tell you everything?
it's just a thought.
hey, maybe that's all right! i don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something i missed... or something...
you're concerned that maybe i can't be trusted with a secret.
i trust you. definitely. no question. but, yeah, i'm a little concerned. i mean, you're not supposed to tell anyone about your patients' problems... are you?
yeah, well... what i was gonna tell you --
-- skip. knowing what you do about me --
doc, i trust you! you've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever.  and this secret i've got, i can't stand it anymore. i don't know if i'm some kind of --
all right, i'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as i can.  and you understand that this is a big secret? just between us?  okay. you know i've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
you are panda, monarch of modems.
that's right. and you also know that even though i make 23% of the modems in the world... i cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
okay... let's say that, for now.
it's true, believe me. so... do you know what i've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?... mr. find-the-need-and-fill- it. how i spend my every solitary hour?
guess.  go ahead, guess!
jerking off?
no!... although that's a good guess. no, what i've been working on, what the world really needs and no one has been able to create --  -- a virtually life-like, humanoid, gender-specific, anatomically functional... sexual surrogate slash companion.
slash what?
sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
a doll?
no, doc, not a doll. i am panda. i'm talking about much, much more than a doll. the world has never seen what i'm talking about... except maybe in the movies.
how's it coming?
you don't think i'm insane?
and that's your secret?  you meant -- like a trade secret?
no, doc, a private secret! it's perverted, it's pitiful. what am i -- dr. frankenstein? aren't you repulsed?
sounds like kind of a good idea.
really?
definitely.
skip, that's not much of a secret.
it's not?
oh, it's okay. it's just not something to be ashamed of. maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, i'd give it, say... a two.
who else knows?
just you.
it's time you did some talkin', dr. mum -- wait a minute. that is your name, isn't it?
damn! what is your name?
doesn't matter. you can call me doc.
it matters to me.
i've told you a lot of private stuff.
i can tell you anything else.
what about everything? how did this happen?
but there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- investigator.
are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
-- an investigator for the internal revenue service?
everybody has a story, skip.
sounds like you have several.
what it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. every time i'd leave a life, it felt good. whatever problems i was having were suddenly gone. i had no friends and i didn't talk to my family. the only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
an irs investigator with a drug problem?
it wasn't the best situation.
did you carry a gun?
didn't need one. we didn't even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. man, the irs... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. nobody wants to argue with the irs.
of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that i fell in love with his wife.
holy shit!
"get to know your therapist."
you were messed up, man.
but look at me now...
hey, you've done good. look at yourself... you've cleaned up, you've got a career --
at least you pulled yourself out...
things got a lot worse.
you and candy...?
and the drugs?
harder than i thought. took me three tries. but i was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. after two bomb-outs, i found a place in the desert...
somebody's taking a shower down there.
that'd be lily.
i wish i could live in the shower. i'd take five a day if i had the time. i went to this spa in germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. and the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
who'd you go with?  that's not good.
how'd you do it?  the new you.
you know how easy it is. a kid can manage it if he wants a fake i.d. you can do practically the whole deal at your local kinko's. the only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
i know it starts with a birth certificate...
all new people start with that...
what about it?
"mumford"... i mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
oh. you got it backwards. i already had the name when i started looking for somewhere to settle. when i saw this town on a map, i thought maybe it was a sign. see...
and a birth certificate is enough?
everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
but you studied psychology, right? you did the training and just never got the degree?
no... no training.
psych major?
english lit.
jeez, man. but you're good at it!
i understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. that's all most people are looking to do.  mainly, i listen.
where ya going? i've got a million questions.
see you thursday... regular time.
you're doing great.
i don't know if i'm going to make it the whole way.
it doesn't matter. go on.
oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. well, i was so... tired of it.  seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... i'm just not getting it right. can we rest for a second?
you're purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
yes.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the roto-rooter.
that was really bad, wasn't it?
disgusting.
and i'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
it's pretty obvious to a trained professional.
is that when you split up?
no, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. we went on for another year or so.
so whose route is this?
brady peck's. fourteen years old. lives next door.
and he's where?
in the capitol for boy's nation. five days. why?
i'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. how hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
you like it?
it's all right.
then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
and this is legitimate therapy?
therapy? hell no, i just don't want to do it alone.
isn't she amazing? that is such a wicked look.
what do you want me to see?
just chill for a second. look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous.
what are you doing? we're not done. i just need to find the thing...
if you don't want to have a session today, it's okay.
i want to have the session. i thought it would be cool if i could show you some of the things that interest me. but i guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
what happened today?
what are you talking about?
was it something that happened at school?
these appointments were not my idea, remember.
true. should we stop them?
i don't think you know what you're talking about.
uh-huh.
this shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial?
there's this kid at school... martin brockett. he has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. you wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... who appointed him my spiritual leader? if he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? and why's he spend all his time chasing after me? probably thinks i'm gonna give him a hummer...
do you think that's what he wants?
no. i don't know what he wants. but i know i don't like being watched. nobody's ever paid any attention to what i did, and i liked it just fine. where does he get off telling me i disrespect myself?  fuck him. look in a mirror, bozo.
they come through a few times each year.  hello, mrs. saito, good to see you again!  it's a tour.
where am i supposed to eat?
you're on your own today, honey.
lily, i want you to meet skip. skip, lily.
it's a pleasure to meet you.
yeah... me you, too... i was at your house...
oh?
upstairs, with doc... yeah, it's very nice... i heard your shower.
i've seen you going by on your board, but i didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
what?
...so rich?
...so accomplished.
so, is this like a japanese restaurant?
i'd better get in there.
that's a lot of people all at once.
it's okay. they pre-order. there's a choice of three entrees.
what are they?
meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
salad nicoise? i love salad nicoise.
you do?
yeah.
well, come on in.
dr. delbanco. it's nice to see you again.
i don't think you know dr. sheeler. she's the other therapist here in town.
of course... i've heard great things about you.
thank you.
you never got back to me.  ...i called to say we'd like to take you out for a meal?... kind of a professional welcome.
forgive me, please. what a gracious thought. we must do that.
when?
why don't i call you when i've got my calendar in front of me?
what are you doing for lunch?
right now?
i've run on. forgive me. we're here to talk about you.
are we?
what ernest means, i think, is we're very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. we're great believers in learning from each other. i've learned so much from ern -- dr. delbanco...
...and i from phyllis.
so... the university of kentucky. who runs the program down there?
my mentor was an amazing teacher named benton mandlebaum. died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
i think i've heard of him... a disciple of rothberg, wasn't he?
it's possible. i don't know about that.
i suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
lots of institutions. my graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. for a while i was chief therapist in a shopping mall. had a little spot next to the yogurt place.
interesting approach. what was his name?
dorothy fowler. fantastic woman. she passed last year in a train wreck. damned amtrak.
i trained in the east, myself -- cornell -- and i don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. i found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... did you?
oh, yeah, very tough. but i guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
which examiner did you have? i probably know him.
wallace franklin... from greensburg.
that was a terrible thing.
i don't even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
we're interested in any new therapies. how would you characterize your approach?
my approach?
yes... your particular approach.
i don't have one really. most of the time i'm faking it. see, i think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time i hear about them. the most i can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. if i can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, i can help them out a little.
-- the argument had nothing to do with it.
i understand. i just want to know what the argument was about.
i had ordered some books. "the 100 greatest books ever written."
uh-huh. what are they?
oh, all the great writers -- shakespeare, charles dickens, moby dick... those people. each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. it's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. right away you get great expectations for just $6.99.
one hundred books?
it's irrelevant. it had nothing to do with what happened.
what happened?
we argued on sunday. he went to work on monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. but on thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. didn't call either. not till saturday afternoon.
you must have been concerned.
it's happened before.  i'm shocked by how little i'm feeling. i can't understand it.  i'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't i?
doubtful. what did he say?
he said he wasn't coming back. he said it wasn't working for him any more. that it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... you know what i regret the most? i'm sorry i let him make the kids take his name. he was an acquirer.  he liked to acquire things.
i know my time's up, but i've got to get this out while i've got hold of it --
take your time.
-- when i was in high school, the thing i wanted most, when i was stuck in class, the thing i was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. that's all i wanted. i loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... and that's how i feel right now... like i have some giant, all- day hall pass.
you can go out there if you like...
"there's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, doc?
i've never brought anyone down here before.
i'm honored.
doc, there's something about what you told me the other night i can't get out of my head. it's driving me batty --  why me? how did you know you could trust me?
you're completely reliable.
skip, i've got a problem and i need some advice.
you want my advice? far out!
pretty creepy, huh? are you totally disgusted?
skip, you're a visionary. that can be a burden.
this doesn't seem a little... perverse?
there are a lot of lonely people in the world. somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
it's not going to be me. i'm giving it up.
really?
it's all your fault. in the last 48 hours, i've completely lost interest.
what'd i do?
lily.
lily...  ...skip, that's great! you and lily.
oh, she doesn't know about it yet. right now, of the two of us, i'm the only one in love. but i'm very stoked.
sorry...
wow.
i'm here for you, doc.
skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
i guess that makes sense.
yes, yes it does...
doc!... it's not me, is it?
what?
hmm. i guess that doesn't help... i see where you're going here. it's a mess.
yep.
but they're certainly dead. and yes, personally, i find it a bit odd.
it could happen. what about his state certification exams? the records seem to be in order.
you do seem much more disposed toward him than i understand, ernest. did i miss something?
oh, for god's sake, phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! are we listening to lionel now?
phyllis, i'm sorry. i didn't mean to shout...
no, dr. delbanco, it is i who am sorry. sorry to have wasted your time with such...
hello, mr. cook. i was wondering if sofie was around?
were you supposed to have a session?
no. it's sort of spur of the moment.
her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. first time in a long time she's been willing.
a friend?
what'd you want?
there's something i think we need to talk about.
what?
finally, some common sense...
what do you mean?
i think you know what i mean.
no, i really don't.
i think you do.
why don't you tell me?
why don't you go to hell? it's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.
well... you see, the problem is --
-- the problem is you're a big fake. you haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl.
wow. you're something.
take a hike, dr. quack!
what is it?
it's a thought i had.
should i open it now?
let me just say something here... i have no idea if this is going to help.
what exactly is it supposed to do?
you remember when i asked you about pornography --
-- i find it degrading. maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
-- and you told me that. still, there's some kind of imagery that's haunting you and, i think, getting in your way --
-- which i don't necessarily agree.
but you did come to me.
my guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... anyway, i thought we could try an experiment.
and the experiment is in here?
whoa, whoa, what are you doing? i want to know what's in here.
there's absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. i'm embarrassed to have --
uh, sorry, i'm going to have to...  ...i really appreciate what you're trying to... uh, i can't thank you enough for...
my pleasure.
when i was in high school we used to come up here and make out. i liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
that's what i like.
which thing?
either one.
why'd you come to the house the other night?
i thought i had something to tell you. but it turned out i didn't.
my brother said you were about to fire me.
that's one way to put it.
i bet i know what changed your mind...  ...my mother. she was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
i thought only action movies had villains like that.
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
yeah?
i can't tell you how much i admire you. you have a wonderful way with people. and you're very insightful. i feel like you've seen me clearly... i never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. you've made that possible for me.
that's... good?
yes! and my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who i was, just like mother. the things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
i don't know if --
you're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. i've never had a man treat me this way. with you, i feel really... listened to.  can i tell you something? it's a little embarrassing, but i feel very unguarded with you.
of course.
thanks to this therapy, i now know what i'm looking for. i need to find a man like you.  not one who's treating me, of course.  and i'm going to do it, dammit! you've given me the confidence.
...i mean, doc, the dude is seriously deluded. i said that to him, i said, "if you think i'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
what'd he say?
he said -- "which we already knew!"
what did he want you to do?
first off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. i told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. as you can see --
...what balls on this guy? what're we...  ...going steady? jesus.
no again?
i said i'd consider it. nobody owns me. and the last thing was insane. i don't know what's wrong with him... no magazines.
really?
i don't know if i can quit. we're gonna try it together, like, you know, aa or something. and i made him give up his .22. no more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
he agreed?
he's pitiful, doc, a goddam puppy. i don't know how much longer i can put up with it. i already got two arms and legs, i don't need another appendage.
hiya, doc.
martin.
did you straighten her out?
how are you?
insane! didn't ja hear? my family got five hundred times better.  let's go, vanessa.
i didn't see you there. can i help you?
my name's gilroy. i'm from the state certification board.
it's all right, it won't bite you. under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. this is the notice.
do you want to come in?
no thanks. plenty of time for that when we're a little further along.
mr. gilroy --
what brought this on?
i'm not at liberty to say. sometimes it's just routine, sometimes there's been a complaint. we'll be in touch.
...i won't go into that today. though, if we should continue these sessions, as i certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that i would like to look at. god knows, i've listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...at any rate, i just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. i just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
how do you mean?
well... you see, when i broke it off with phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring...
what kind of doubts?
about you... your background and your qualifications. i'm afraid phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board.
i see.
and please, for whatever small way i may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  there is good news, though.
what's that?
phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
dr. sheeler is leaving mumford? i'm sorry to hear that.
as you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... unlike, i must say, those of my wife.
i feel like we're making real progress here.
me too, doc. and i can't tell you what that package meant to me --
i need to talk to you... doctor. can i come in?
of course.
it might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
is something wrong, sofie?
yes, something's very wrong, dr. mumford.
you're upset.
how intuitive! that must take years of training right there. maybe you can guess what has upset me.
is it something you've heard about me?
no, it is not something i've heard about you! it is someth--  why? is there something i should have heard about you?
why don't you tell me what's on your mind?
all right... i'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
um-huh.
first of all, i have been feeling much better lately. i don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but i feel a hundred per cent better than when i first came to you.
i'm glad.
given that, i'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
i don't follow you.
i'm saying that since i'm doing so much better -- which i attribute to you -- i'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
okay...
the point is this -- i am not a blank page. i did not just fall off the turnip truck. do you know what i mean?
i think so.
i know a little about psychology. i took three different courses in college. it's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but i took them... and there was one concept i remember very well.
what was that?
transference!
transference.
yes, and that is what i have got right now. i have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. i have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... so that now i am under the delusion...  ...that i am in love with you.
hello?
hello.
i think you can understand why i have some serious questions about your methods. i mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that i'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities --
doc...
lily.
doc.
i don't want you to be mad at skip...
he told you.
skip and i wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. that's a big deal.
you would have met in some shower eventually...
i want to give you something. will you let me?
thanks, lily, i don't need anything.
yes, you do, you damn well do.
okay.
here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
that's it? that's what you're giving me?
clean up the mess. no matter what it takes.
what it might take is... doing time.
too bad. that's tough, i mean it. i'm not unsympathetic. but skip says you're in love.
well, look who's here...
good evening, mrs. cook.
just who is here, can you tell me?
could i see sofie, please?
no, you can not. i wouldn't know who to say is calling.
mother...
what do you think i'm after, mrs. cook?
sofie. it's so obvious... you're after my daughter.
well, i gotta say, mrs. cook, you're right about that.
it'll never happen! you're in big trouble, mister.
mother... go away!
i guess you saw the show...?
which show was that?
sofie...
part of it. we were watching "er" until someone called.
you probably got the idea.
...how violated i feel?
you're not the only one...
you feel violated?
not me... all my other my patients. i smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
you deserve it.
i am irate!
but...
but nothing... i'm mad as hell. this is a terrible thing you've done.
i know it! please believe me, i know that...
but, there is one... mitigating factor i want you to consider before you write me off.
what?
will you think about it?
i don't know. depends. i'm in a bad mood.
i love you. more than i've ever loved anyone or anything in my life.
oh.
i want to spend the rest of my life with you... but i'm not sure you feel the same way.
...but first, you have to tell me something...
anything... just ask.
what is your name?
clarence norman white, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
i do.
do you realize how insidious it is to invade the most private thoughts and secret lives of unsuspecting people?...
...people who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are?
yes, your honor.
it means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. you understand that?
yes.
mr. white, i am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
i'm sorry, your honor.
what?
i'm sorry you're frustrated.
are you disrespecting this court, mr. white?
no, sir. i was empathizing. sorry.
maybe you can empathize with this -- maximum fine. three months in jail, three months house arrest. sentence to begin immediately at the orchard valley correctional facility. case closed. this court is adjourned.
it's a country club. don't worry about it.
thanks for your help, lionel.
you got off easy.
will you wait for me?
we're only talking about six weeks.
will you be here?
of course... i haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.
better make yourself comfortable. we got a three hour drive here.
i'm fine.
you're the shrink, aren't you?
no, not really.
but you do therapy?
not any more.
