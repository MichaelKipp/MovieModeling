i have eighteen more minutes!
i do not want to hear any more today.
why not?
mr. follett, do you trust me or do not you?
well, i do not know... i only been seeing you --
without trust, there is no point to any of this. you might as well not come.
now hold on, i did not say i did not want to come --
good, then go.
you are early... it is not ready. what happened?
my patient had to leave early.
who was that?
does the phrase "nosy" have any meaning to you, lily?
i think it is like... inquisitive.
it was henry follett.
man, you see him a lot. and it is very wrong to reveal it. next you will be saying what his problem is.
what do you want to know?
you are terrible. I am never telling you anything.
how long you been in this town?
oh, i do not know...
four months, two and a half weeks -- that is how long.  and you have already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
lily, i do not think even you could know that --
you know who that is, do not you?  you really don't? that is skip skipperton, man. he gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
oh, so that is him? the panda man.
so, what makes you so popular? what is your secret?
you like me. how come?
not sure. let me think about it.
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "naomi forever"... and now they are broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. but while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets chandra. and it is serious, immediate love. so in no time, he is gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in north america.
what do you mean, "in no time"?
in maybe three or four issues.
weekly or monthly?
monthly! god, how shallow do you think brad is? why do i waste my time telling you this stuff?
why do you think you tell me, nessa?
do not do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
it is a big part of the show.
the school board does not pay you? what kind of deal is that?
it is called pro bono.
pro boner?  pro bono, huh? for whose good, supposedly?
it is my bit for the community.
fuck the community.  there was this article my friends and i read. it was "25 signs he is great in bed". it was very fascinating.
where was this?
where?... the new york times. the first one was -- "he handles produce well." which we already knew!  the point is, you have a lot of the signs.
you been spying on me in the supermarket, nessa?
have women found you attractive?
i knew you would not answer. I have been thinking about what you said last time. how me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. how maybe i can not lose the weight, ever...  which we already knew...
that is not quite what i said --
it is a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they would accept that some things do not change -- that it would be some kind of a relief or something...
you are doc mumford.  skip skipperton.
how are you?
fine. okay. pretty good. I have been hoping we would meet. I have heard a lot about you.
..."find the need and fill it" my dad used to say -- i guess a lot of dads say that -- but i did and it just took off.
no kidding... panda. where did that come from?
panda? I have always liked giant pandas... I have been to china and seen them in the wild. that is the kind of thing i can do if i want... now. i can do pretty much anything i want to do these days.
would you like another beer?
nah... scotch.
far out. single malt?  can i pick it?
can i ask you a personal question?
of course! that is exactly what i want.
have you thought about getting a wife?
i got to pee.  can i ask you something? this town is called mumford... been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0...  ...thirteen! right?  now here's the question -- your name is mumford, too.
is that the question?
you moved here from back east and your name is the same as this town. is that right?  far out.
i hope you do not think i want you to do this for free. just because we are going to play it like we are friends, does not mean i will not pay you like a doctor.
i understand.
i have a lot of money. do you know how much money I have got?
do not tell me, 'cause I am not going to tell you what I have got.
I have got three big ones.
I am impressed. i could not make three million dollars if i lived three lifetimes.
no, no... i have three billion dollars.
-- you can sit up and look at me if you would like --  -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.
kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, are not you? how 'bout you let me explain it my own way...
...but it is not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it is the school from the next district --
-- go on!
-- you crazy? you can not do this!
sure i can, lionel.
I am a criminal lawyer -- you think i like my clients? i can not stand most of them! but i do not kick them out...
see that sign -- we retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I am not going to charge you for this session, but i do not want to see you back here.
do not you at least have a back door i can use?
come out this way. there is no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, althea?
maybe some of us do not need this crap!
and it is the hubble telescope, not the himball telescope.
what do they want from me?  what have i done that is so wrong?  they act as though they do not have their own peculiar things... they do! believe me. everybody's got something...  even you probably have things.
me more than most.
why are they ganging up against me?
I am not sure. but i think they are worried about you.
it is the kids, you know, not jeremy. he had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. he is always willing to pay. he is extremely generous.  I am so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
how did they threaten you?
they said if i did not get help, they would not deal with me any more.  what do you think about that?
good kids.
mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
hmm?
i said... you must come out to the house for dinner on thursday.
really? you think so?
yes. jeremy will be home for the weekend. and you can meet the kids.
how ya doin', ainge? evenin', lily.
doc.  ainge...
dr. mumford.
mr. cook.
could you come with me please?
i know i shoulda come to your office. i was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
uh-huh.
it is my daughter sofie... she is got to problem.
what is that?
we are not sure. she is been to all kinds of doctors in the city and they have said different things. some of 'em are callin' it --  -- epstein-barr virus, and the rest are callin' it... chronic fatigue symptom...
syndrome... chronic fatigue syndrome.
that is it -- syndrome. so you know all about it?
no... a little. there is a lot of debate about it.
yeah, i got that. some people think it is all in their heads.  it is been so bad she is had to move back here to mumford and live with us. and I am not sure that is the best thing, either...
why is that?
oh... a lot of things. several different factors. will you see her, doctor mumford?
sure. why do not you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon.
I am not sure she will come. she is in a mood. do you ever go to somebody is house?
generally that does not work out so well. it sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change.
hello, lionel.
you have got to have the right ladder for the job. you do not know what you are doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
you are right, as usual. see you.
what an asshole!
ernest, what do you think?
i think he is got a point.
this is great!
this is exactly what i wanted.
skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
you would be surprised. most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. they are busy. it is not as easy as you think.
skip, you are the head of the whole deal here. are they busier than you?
well, you know... that is the thing. like i said, just about everybody in town works for me. and it is just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. it is like an order or something... and no one -- no one -- asks me.
so, would you say we are out here... let me think how to put this... is your problem really that you're... lonely?
do not you like this?
hell yes, i like it. what is better than this? most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
okay then.  have you got a lot of friends?
lily and i talk a bit. you know lily, runs the coffee shop?
no... I have seen her. good-looking woman.
she is probably ten years older than you.
good-looking woman.
lives downstairs from me. she is got a great dog named for danny ainge.
really? I am the only person i know that likes danny ainge, outside of celtic fans. maybe phoenix.
well, there is lily.
did you know that danny ainge was drafted by the blue jays? do you know what kind of athlete you have to be to play in the nba and in the bigs?
amazing.
unbelievable...  ...and lily named her dog after him? far out.
what kind of person do you have to be to do this?
what?
this --
so i guess henry follett is a patient of yours. he is my pharmacist.
yeah.  guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
pretty good, too. lots of detail. nothing hard core. old-fashioned ones, from back when people cared about atmosphere and character.
uh-huh.
problem is, his fantasy life's a lot better than his real one. nothing can live up to it. his wife got sick of it and left him. took his kids with her.
i wondered what happened to her...
feel free to lie down. most people do.
I would better not, I will fall right to sleep. i think it is too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
what can you tell me about this?
oh, lord. it is almost too exhausting to tell you...  ...about my exhaustion. i did not really want to come. I am not hopeful right now. but i could not take the look on my dad's face. he is a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. he is the opposite of me, i guess -- all stamina and resolve.
when did you start to feel this way?
about six months ago, i guess it is now. god, it seems like years. what a bore! I am embarrassed by it. before this happened -- when I would hear people talk about this kind of thing -- i thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
what?
you think that now! you think it is a bunch of hooey, do not you?
no.
i saw it. i saw it in your eyes.
that is okay. maybe it is. my mother always says -- "everything that is wrong with you is in your head." i suppose that is true.
back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? a change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind?
no... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. that is not too suspicious, is it?... but it was not like i was feeling bad about the divorce. just the opposite.
hmm.
hmm? is that a professional opinion?
hmm, as in -- that is interesting. sometimes, with enough clues, it is possible to figure these things out.
even if you do not think it is real?
i do not know what is real and what isn't. that is never been my strong suit. but if you are tired all the time and you have had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you did not want to... that is worth trying to fix. maybe i can help you do that.
what would you do?
we... we would try several things. but i need to see you a lot.
i do not know. i barely made it today.
I will come to you. we will try a little walking.
we will take it slow. you will never feel you can not handle it.
i do not think i can afford it. i do not want my dad paying.
we will work it out.
you have the best answer for everything.  you seem so... hopeful. are you always this sunny?
no one ever thought so. you must bring it out.
is it contagious? 'cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
maybe you will catch it.
can i ask you something?  did not you tell my dad you did not think it was a good idea to come to the patient?  so what changed?
you must be dr. mumford of mumford. jeremy brockett.
doc. nice to meet you.
sorry I am late... traffic was a motherfucker. have another drink, I will be back in five.
i think you will like this. know much about cuban cigars?
nope.
are you a man who likes to treat himself right?
I have had my moments.
i am. and I am not ashamed of it. nobody ever said on their death bed -- "i treated myself too well."
i thought it was -- nobody ever said, "i should have spent more time at the office."
fill in the blank. i do not mind the office. the point is, you only go 'round once. like the zens say -- be here now.
what do you do?
althea has not told you?
we have been talking about her, mostly.
well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. we have got twenty-three people working there now.
you have done well.
we have done... very well. you know anything about addiction, doc?
a little.
well, I am addicted to winning. i say when you are in the red zone, you got to score.  so what do you think?
tastes good.
no... i mean about althea. about her...  ...behavior. do you think you can fix her up?
what do you think's wrong with her?
she is gone weird is what is wrong with her. out of control. probably from living out here in mayberry.
you are the doctor, what do you think?
she seems very unhappy.
but you know how to drive?
sure.
got a license?  but no car?
do not need it.
i just got my license two weeks ago.
you are good.
i been drivin' since i was twelve.
that would explain it.
can you help mom?
I am trying.
got to.
what is wrong with her?
is she a friend of yours?
no... sort of. man, she could be cool, but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys. she is blowin' them in the parking lot.
do we run into the street? no, i did not think so.  nice car. how is that place?
it is a pretty piece of land.
and the brocketts?
horror show. what did you do tonight?
it was insane here, man. 'hadda call in the national guard.  then i did my laundry... watched 20/20.
...and?
shocking. did you know the government is wasteful?  you heard it here first. oh, and being a supermodel... it is no walk in the park.
why do you watch?
no gentleman caller, doc.  not that i care. I have had it with men. they are so fascinated by their own crap. took me four years to get the last one out. almost turned me into a dyke... these days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed. now that feels good. and you do not have to do all that... listening.
I am not making any promises.
we will turn back anytime you want.
oh boy... this should be interesting.
hello, mother. i want you to meet dr. mumford.
mumford... like the town?
what is happening here?
we are going for a walk.
do you think that is a good idea?
dr. mumford does, yes. I have put myself completely in his hands. for today, anyway.
what kind of doctor are you?
ph.d., psychologist.
oh... not a real doctor.
that is right, the fake kind.
mom's such a cutie.
people usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
she is not in a bad mood. she is like that all the time.  it does not bother me anymore. it is my dad and my brother i worry about.
maybe... but you are the one whose ass is dragging.
is that the technical description of what I have got?
is she against you getting help?
we do not discuss it.
something is bothering her.
oh, we have all disappointed her. me, especially, but dad, of course. she thinks my brother's all right, but she did not expect much. it is what happens when you "marry beneath yourself"...
please... forgive me.
what?
negative thinking makes everything more difficult. if you are going to have enough strength to do this, we have to talk only about positive things. all right?
okay then... are you positive your mother's a bitch?  just kidding.
you have got a funny idea of funny.
I have offended you!
no.
really? what would it take?
is this the treatment?
sorry... I am done.
'cause I will tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.
I am embarrassed. the list is so long.
be specific.
well... I am tired all the time, obviously. i always feel like taking a nap. but when i try to sleep, i have trouble.  my muscles ache. and my joints. i feel like an old person, or like i did back when i used to work out too hard... what else?...
sore throat?
uh-huh.
painful lymph glands?  forget fulness... irritability... depression?
yes, yes, and definitely yes. also... i get confused.
yeah, most people have that. it is confusing here.
where?
life.
i do not know if i mentioned the headaches.
did you get headaches before this?  but you get more now? or more severe?
no, not really. they are about the same. my marriage was one long headache.
so the headaches may not even be a part of this?
i can give myself a headache instantly.
is that like a party trick?
all i have to do is have two conflicting thoughts at the same time... like I will think -- 'taking these walks is going to help sofie get better.' but then I will also think -- 'mumford, you just enjoy taking these walks and you are kidding yourself about the benefits.'
there... I have given myself a real whopper.
you actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  so you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. it makes tiny little tears in our fabric.
well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
or maybe it was not an accident at all --
mr. follett.
-- 'cause in that instant i saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and i knew --
henry!
what?
stop now.
why? I am paying for this.
not for this. not me, you are not.
you find it distasteful, do not you?
it does not matter how i feel about it. it is how you feel about it that matters.
i enjoy it. does that make me some kind of pervert? just because a man has a rich imaginative life --
you did not come to me because you have a rich imagination.
no?
you came because it is taking over. you are in its grip.
i never said that.
where is your wife, henry?
go to hell.
i did not hear you.
we got divorced.  i had to get rid of her. she could not satisfy me.
what?!
i was... never satisfied.
now we are back on track.
what is that?
you are so mean.
hey, skip.
doc. i know we are not supposed to get together till wednesday...
that is all right. what is on your mind?
how many sessions have we had now, doc?  six. and it is been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. just shootin' the shit.
yep.
i want to tell you something, doc, but before i do, i need to ask you a question... because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, i have not told anybody about this. it is the biggest secret I have got.
sometimes it is best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
you are a shrink, doc. are not i supposed to be able to tell you everything?
it is just a thought.
hey, maybe that is all right! i do not know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there is something i missed... or something...
you are concerned that maybe i can not be trusted with a secret.
i trust you. definitely. no question. but, yeah, I am a little concerned. i mean, you are not supposed to tell anyone about your patients' problems... are you?
yeah, well... what i was gonna tell you --
-- skip. knowing what you do about me --
doc, i trust you! you have listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever.  and this secret I have got, i can not stand it anymore. i do not know if I am some kind of --
all right, I am just going to tell you, as simple and direct as i can.  and you understand that this is a big secret? just between us?  okay. you know I have got this gift for certain kinds of... machines.
you are panda, monarch of modems.
that is right. and you also know that even though i make 23% of the modems in the world... i cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me.
okay... let's say that, for now.
it is true, believe me. so... do you know what I have been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?... mr. find-the-need-and-fill- it. how i spend my every solitary hour?
guess.  go ahead, guess!
jerking off?
no!... although that is a good guess. no, what I have been working on, what the world really needs and no one has been able to create --  -- a virtually life-like, humanoid, gender-specific, anatomically functional... sexual surrogate slash companion.
slash what?
sexual surrogate... slash... companion.
a doll?
no, doc, not a doll. i am panda. I am talking about much, much more than a doll. the world has never seen what I am talking about... except maybe in the movies.
how is it coming?
you do not think I am insane?
and that is your secret?  you meant -- like a trade secret?
no, doc, a private secret! it is perverted, it is pitiful. what am i -- dr. frankenstein? are not you repulsed?
sounds like kind of a good idea.
really?
definitely.
skip, that is not much of a secret.
it is not?
oh, it is okay. it is just not something to be ashamed of. maybe you do not want people knowing -- and believe me, it is safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, I would give it, say... a two.
who else knows?
just you.
it is time you did some talkin', dr. mum -- wait a minute. that is your name, is not it?
damn! what is your name?
does not matter. you can call me doc.
it matters to me.
I have told you a lot of private stuff.
i can tell you anything else.
what about everything? how did this happen?
but there was one job that looked like it might be fun -- investigator.
are you telling me your last job before becoming a psychologist was --
-- an investigator for the internal revenue service?
everybody has a story, skip.
sounds like you have several.
what it felt like was... a series of separate, unconnected lives -- hillbilly kid, wrecked college boy, garbage man, civil service guy...  ...et cetera... et cetera. every time I would leave a life, it felt good. whatever problems i was having were suddenly gone. i had no friends and i did not talk to my family. the only constant, stabilizing force in my life was... drugs.
an irs investigator with a drug problem?
it was not the best situation.
did you carry a gun?
did not need one. we did not even need a warrant for most of the shit we did. man, the irs... we could go in your bank account, your credit cards... hell, we used to go into doctors' files and get all the juicy details. nobody wants to argue with the irs.
of course, him being insane did not make it all right that i fell in love with his wife.
holy shit!
"get to know your therapist."
you were messed up, man.
but look at me now...
hey, you have done good. look at yourself... you have cleaned up, you have got a career --
at least you pulled yourself out...
things got a lot worse.
you and candy...?
and the drugs?
harder than i thought. took me three tries. but i was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. after two bomb-outs, i found a place in the desert...
somebody is taking a shower down there.
that would be lily.
i wish i could live in the shower. I would take five a day if i had the time. i went to this spa in germany, a sanitarium practically, up on this mountain. and the great thing -- they just kept you wet all day.
who would you go with?  that is not good.
how did you do it?  the new you.
you know how easy it is. a kid can manage it if he wants a fake i.d. you can do practically the whole deal at your local kinko's. the only variable is how much pride you take in the product.
i know it starts with a birth certificate...
all new people start with that...
what about it?
"mumford"... i mean, why pick the name of the town you were going to?
oh. you got it backwards. i already had the name when i started looking for somewhere to settle. when i saw this town on a map, i thought maybe it was a sign. see...
and a birth certificate is enough?
everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
but you studied psychology, right? you did the training and just never got the degree?
no... no training.
psych major?
english lit.
jeez, man. but you are good at it!
i understand what it is like to want to leave a problem behind. that is all most people are looking to do.  mainly, i listen.
where ya going? I have got a million questions.
see you thursday... regular time.
you are doing great.
i do not know if I am going to make it the whole way.
it does not matter. go on.
oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he would told me about some preference of his. well, i was so... tired of it.  seems like my whole life someone is been telling me... I am just not getting it right. can we rest for a second?
you are purposely making me talk while we do this...  ...because you think this is good for me...  ...and you are a sadistic bastard...
yes.
...who thinks there is nothing really wrong with me.
oh, there is something wrong with you, all right. especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the roto-rooter.
that was really bad, was not it?
disgusting.
and I will bet you can interpret the whole thing
it is pretty obvious to a trained professional.
is that when you split up?
no, that would be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. we went on for another year or so.
so whose route is this?
brady peck's. fourteen years old. lives next door.
and he is where?
in the capitol for boy's nation. five days. why?
I am thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. how hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
you like it?
it is all right.
then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning.
and this is legitimate therapy?
therapy? hell no, i just do not want to do it alone.
is not she amazing? that is such a wicked look.
what do you want me to see?
just chill for a second. look at this guy, it appears he is actually dead... but gorgeous.
what are you doing? we are not done. i just need to find the thing...
if you do not want to have a session today, it is okay.
i want to have the session. i thought it would be cool if i could show you some of the things that interest me. but i guess you are not into it... which we already knew.
what happened today?
what are you talking about?
was it something that happened at school?
these appointments were not my idea, remember.
true. should we stop them?
i do not think you know what you are talking about.
uh-huh.
this shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial?
there is this kid at school... martin brockett. he has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. you would not believe the crap he lays on me... who appointed him my spiritual leader? if he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? and why is he spend all his time chasing after me? probably thinks I am going to give him a hummer...
do you think that is what he wants?
no. i do not know what he wants. but i know i do not like being watched. nobody's ever paid any attention to what i did, and i liked it just fine. where does he get off telling me i disrespect myself?  fuck him. look in a mirror, bozo.
they come through a few times each year.  hello, mrs. saito, good to see you again!  it is a tour.
where am i supposed to eat?
you are on your own today, honey.
lily, i want you to meet skip. skip, lily.
it is a pleasure to meet you.
yeah... me you, too... i was at your house...
oh?
upstairs, with doc... yeah, it is very nice... i heard your shower.
I have seen you going by on your board, but i did not realize -- you are so young... to be so...
what?
...so rich?
...so accomplished.
so, is this like a japanese restaurant?
I would better get in there.
that is a lot of people all at once.
it is okay. they pre-order. there is a choice of three entrees.
what are they?
meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
salad nicoise? i love salad nicoise.
you do?
yeah.
well, come on in.
dr. delbanco. it is nice to see you again.
i do not think you know dr. sheeler. she is the other therapist here in town.
of course... I have heard great things about you.
thank you.
you never got back to me.  ...i called to say we would like to take you out for a meal?... kind of a professional welcome.
forgive me, please. what a gracious thought. we must do that.
when?
why do not i call you when I have got my calendar in front of me?
what are you doing for lunch?
right now?
I have run on. forgive me. we are here to talk about you.
are we?
what ernest means, i think, is we are very interested in other methodology... different kinds of training. we are great believers in learning from each other. I have learned so much from ern -- dr. delbanco...
...and i from phyllis.
so... the university of kentucky. who runs the program down there?
my mentor was an amazing teacher named benton mandlebaum. died quite tragically in the collapse of a gazebo.
i think I have heard of him... a disciple of rothberg, was not he?
it is possible. i do not know about that.
i suppose your extended training was at an institution in that area?
lots of institutions. my graduate advisor believed we should experience as many environments as possible -- prisons, clinics, half-way houses. for a while i was chief therapist in a shopping mall. had a little spot next to the yogurt place.
interesting approach. what was his name?
dorothy fowler. fantastic woman. she passed last year in a train wreck. damned amtrak.
i trained in the east, myself -- cornell -- and i do not care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. i found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... did you?
oh, yeah, very tough. but i guess that is good... to keep out the quacks.
which examiner did you have? i probably know him.
wallace franklin... from greensburg.
that was a terrible thing.
i do not even know why hang-gliding is considered a legitimate sport.
we are interested in any new therapies. how would you characterize your approach?
my approach?
yes... your particular approach.
i do not have one really. most of the time I am faking it. see, i think there is not much that can be done about most problems... they are too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time i hear about them. the most i can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. if i can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, i can help them out a little.
-- the argument had nothing to do with it.
i understand. i just want to know what the argument was about.
i had ordered some books. "the 100 greatest books ever written."
uh-huh. what are they?
oh, all the great writers -- shakespeare, charles dickens, moby dick... those people. each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. it is a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. right away you get great expectations for just $6.99.
one hundred books?
it is irrelevant. it had nothing to do with what happened.
what happened?
we argued on sunday. he went to work on monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. but on thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. did not call either. not till saturday afternoon.
you must have been concerned.
it is happened before.  I am shocked by how little I am feeling. i can not understand it.  I will probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, will not i?
doubtful. what did he say?
he said he was not coming back. he said it was not working for him any more. that it had not "worked for him" for quite a while... you know what i regret the most? I am sorry i let him make the kids take his name. he was an acquirer.  he liked to acquire things.
i know my time's up, but I have got to get this out while I have got hold of it --
take your time.
-- when i was in high school, the thing i wanted most, when i was stuck in class, the thing i was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. that is all i wanted. i loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... and that is how i feel right now... like i have some giant, all- day hall pass.
you can go out there if you like...
"there's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, doc?
I have never brought anyone down here before.
I am honored.
doc, there is something about what you told me the other night i can not get out of my head. it is driving me batty --  why me? how did you know you could trust me?
you are completely reliable.
skip, I have got a problem and i need some advice.
you want my advice? far out!
pretty creepy, huh? are you totally disgusted?
skip, you are a visionary. that can be a burden.
this does not seem a little... perverse?
there are a lot of lonely people in the world. somebody is going to figure this out someday.
it is not going to be me. I am giving it up.
really?
it is all your fault. in the last 48 hours, I have completely lost interest.
what did i do?
lily.
lily...  ...skip, that is great! you and lily.
oh, she does not know about it yet. right now, of the two of us, I am the only one in love. but I am very stoked.
sorry...
wow.
I am here for you, doc.
skip, you know that it is improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients?
i guess that makes sense.
yes, yes it does...
doc!... it is not me, is it?
what?
hmm. i guess that does not help... i see where you are going here. it is a mess.
yep.
but they are certainly dead. and yes, personally, i find it a bit odd.
it could happen. what about his state certification exams? the records seem to be in order.
you do seem much more disposed toward him than i understand, ernest. did i miss something?
oh, for god's sake, phyllis -- we have no reason to doubt the man! are we listening to lionel now?
phyllis, I am sorry. i did not mean to shout...
no, dr. delbanco, it is i who am sorry. sorry to have wasted your time with such...
hello, mr. cook. i was wondering if sofie was around?
were you supposed to have a session?
no. it is sort of spur of the moment.
her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. first time in a long time she is been willing.
a friend?
what did you want?
there is something i think we need to talk about.
what?
finally, some common sense...
what do you mean?
i think you know what i mean.
no, i really don't.
i think you do.
why do not you tell me?
why do not you go to hell? it is all a bunch of nonsense and you know it.
well... you see, the problem is --
-- the problem is you are a big fake. you have not got a clue what is wrong with that girl.
wow. you are something.
take a hike, dr. quack!
what is it?
it is a thought i had.
should i open it now?
let me just say something here... i have no idea if this is going to help.
what exactly is it supposed to do?
you remember when i asked you about pornography --
-- i find it degrading. maximum gynecology and minimum turn-on --
-- and you told me that. still, there is some kind of imagery that is haunting you and, i think, getting in your way --
-- which i do not necessarily agree.
but you did come to me.
my guess is these images were burned into your brain when you were young. maybe if we could nail down the exact fantasies that are haunting you -- maybe you could get past them... anyway, i thought we could try an experiment.
and the experiment is in here?
whoa, whoa, what are you doing? i want to know what is in here.
there is absolutely no reason to think this is going to have any impact on you. I am embarrassed to have --
uh, sorry, I am going to have to...  ...i really appreciate what you are trying to... uh, i can not thank you enough for...
my pleasure.
when i was in high school we used to come up here and make out. i liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
that is what i like.
which thing?
either one.
why did you come to the house the other night?
i thought i had something to tell you. but it turned out i didn't.
my brother said you were about to fire me.
that is one way to put it.
i bet i know what changed your mind...  ...my mother. she was so horrible, you decided you could not desert me.
i thought only action movies had villains like that.
-- you have been a tremendous help to me.
yeah?
i can not tell you how much i admire you. you have a wonderful way with people. and you are very insightful. i feel like you have seen me clearly... i never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. you have made that possible for me.
that's... good?
yes! and my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who i was, just like mother. the things you have said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
i do not know if --
you are shockingly honest, that is what makes you great. I have never had a man treat me this way. with you, i feel really... listened to.  can i tell you something? it is a little embarrassing, but i feel very unguarded with you.
of course.
thanks to this therapy, i now know what I am looking for. i need to find a man like you.  not one who is treating me, of course.  and I am going to do it, dammit! you have given me the confidence.
...i mean, doc, the dude is seriously deluded. i said that to him, i said, "if you think I am going to do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
what did he say?
he said -- "which we already knew!"
what did he want you to do?
first off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. i told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. as you can see --
...what balls on this guy? what are we...  ...going steady? jesus.
no again?
i said I would consider it. nobody owns me. and the last thing was insane. i do not know what is wrong with him... no magazines.
really?
i do not know if i can quit. we are going to try it together, like, you know, aa or something. and i made him give up his .22. no more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
he agreed?
he is pitiful, doc, a goddam puppy. i do not know how much longer i can put up with it. i already got two arms and legs, i do not need another appendage.
hiya, doc.
martin.
did you straighten her out?
how are you?
insane! did not ja hear? my family got five hundred times better.  let's go, vanessa.
i did not see you there. can i help you?
my name's gilroy. I am from the state certification board.
it is all right, it will not bite you. under civil code 1294.67b you are entitled to be notified that your status and certification are being reviewed. this is the notice.
do you want to come in?
no thanks. plenty of time for that when we are a little further along.
mr. gilroy --
what brought this on?
I am not at liberty to say. sometimes it is just routine, sometimes there is been a complaint. we will be in touch.
...i will not go into that today. though, if we should continue these sessions, as i certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that i would like to look at. god knows, I have listened to enough people giving me the juicy --  ...at any rate, i just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. i just hope that it does not come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.
how do you mean?
well... you see, when i broke it off with phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she is been harboring...
what kind of doubts?
about you... your background and your qualifications. I am afraid phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board.
i see.
and please, for whatever small way i may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.  there is good news, though.
what is that?
phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. which leaves you the only psychologist in town.
dr. sheeler is leaving mumford? I am sorry to hear that.
as you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... unlike, i must say, those of my wife.
i feel like we are making real progress here.
me too, doc. and i can not tell you what that package meant to me --
i need to talk to you... doctor. can i come in?
of course.
it might have been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
is something wrong, sofie?
yes, something is very wrong, dr. mumford.
you are upset.
how intuitive! that must take years of training right there. maybe you can guess what has upset me.
is it something you have heard about me?
no, it is not something I have heard about you! it is someth--  why? is there something i should have heard about you?
why do not you tell me what is on your mind?
all right... I am going to come right out and say this, because that is what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what is bothering you?
um-huh.
first of all, i have been feeling much better lately. i do not know if the syndrome is over -- if it is just run its course or something -- but i feel a hundred per cent better than when i first came to you.
I am glad.
given that, I am obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
i do not follow you.
I am saying that since I am doing so much better -- which i attribute to you -- I am liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
okay...
the point is this -- i am not a blank page. i did not just fall off the turnip truck. do you know what i mean?
i think so.
i know a little about psychology. i took three different courses in college. it is true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but i took them... and there was one concept i remember very well.
what was that?
transference!
transference.
yes, and that is what i have got right now. i have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. i have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... so that now i am under the delusion...  ...that i am in love with you.
hello?
hello.
i think you can understand why i have some serious questions about your methods. i mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I am going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities --
doc...
lily.
doc.
i do not want you to be mad at skip...
he told you.
skip and i would not have got together if it were not for you. that is a big deal.
you would have met in some shower eventually...
i want to give you something. will you let me?
thanks, lily, i do not need anything.
yes, you do, you damn well do.
okay.
here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
that is it? that is what you are giving me?
clean up the mess. no matter what it takes.
what it might take is... doing time.
too bad. that is tough, i mean it. I am not unsympathetic. but skip says you are in love.
well, look who is here...
good evening, mrs. cook.
just who is here, can you tell me?
could i see sofie, please?
no, you can not. i would not know who to say is calling.
mother...
what do you think I am after, mrs. cook?
sofie. it is so obvious... you are after my daughter.
well, i got to say, mrs. cook, you are right about that.
it will never happen! you are in big trouble, mister.
mother... go away!
i guess you saw the show...?
which show was that?
sofie...
part of it. we were watching "er" until someone called.
you probably got the idea.
...how violated i feel?
you are not the only one...
you feel violated?
not me... all my other my patients. i smelled tar and feathers on the way over here.
you deserve it.
i am irate!
but...
but nothing... I am mad as hell. this is a terrible thing you have done.
i know it! please believe me, i know that...
but, there is one... mitigating factor i want you to consider before you write me off.
what?
will you think about it?
i do not know. depends. I am in a bad mood.
i love you. more than I have ever loved anyone or anything in my life.
oh.
i want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I am not sure you feel the same way.
...but first, you have to tell me something...
anything... just ask.
what is your name?
clarence norman white, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged?
i do.
do you realize how insidious it is to invade the most private thoughts and secret lives of unsuspecting people?...
...people who have come to you with the faith that you know what you are doing... and that you are who you say you are?
yes, your honor.
it means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. you understand that?
yes.
mr. white, i am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
I am sorry, your honor.
what?
I am sorry you are frustrated.
are you disrespecting this court, mr. white?
no, sir. i was empathizing. sorry.
maybe you can empathize with this -- maximum fine. three months in jail, three months house arrest. sentence to begin immediately at the orchard valley correctional facility. case closed. this court is adjourned.
it is a country club. do not worry about it.
thanks for your help, lionel.
you got off easy.
will you wait for me?
we are only talking about six weeks.
will you be here?
of course... i have not got the energy to get out of town that fast.
better make yourself comfortable. we got a three hour drive here.
I am fine.
you are the shrink, are not you?
no, not really.
but you do therapy?
not any more.
