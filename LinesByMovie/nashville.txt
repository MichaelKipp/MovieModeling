you want a ride into town?
you bet.
got me an audition tonight.
well, you just remember, if you can not kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you are kicking... ten minutes, okay?
he is my father.
haven hamilton is your father? can you arrange an interview?
did you see who that was?
glad to see you. ester'll be glad, too.
he is just wonderful.
i'1l get your bag.
pleasure
where is she?
uh huh.
she is been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
you know anything about the stations here?
it is hard to say. doctors thought she would come home a week ago. all it was was appendix.
all they got is advertisements. just like l.a.
did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
well, i could use one, especially if I am pregnant.
what did you say?
i said, maybe I will change my name again.
i see... well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
but not unless nashville really inspires me.
maybe you can look after me a little.
that tom sure is cute.
no -- that is exercises. my coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. that is the place where i sing.
you think i got any kind of a voice?
you sure do it loud.
is that good?
it is not bad.
you think i should take lessons?
if you are serious. being serious is real important.
you serious?
wade -- I have been working toward this audition for years.
well, honey, i sure hope it comes your way then.
you think it will?
sure thing.
what do you think of him?
hal? well, hal and i have been friends for a long time.
you go to school together?
no, we never did that
oh --
we are connected by a relative. one time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. that was a long time ago, though. how did you come to work for him?
well, i really think he is got a chance.
you do?
oh yea -- there has never been a better time for something new.
he am not really new.
he is to a lot of people.
he was a good judge, but that was a long time ago.
you know, I will bet you he makes it with a majority.
where are you from?
southern california.
you always live there?
spent time in arizona. why?
well, i admire your optimism, and i just wondered if it was regional. you ever see any movie stars?
i know a couple.
no kidding -- wait till i tell linnea. who?
ah... peter finch.
who?
peter finch -- he is english.
i never heard of him. name somebody else.
ryan o'neal.
you really do?  ~ god -- how come you know them?
oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
I will be damned. boy, if you could get ryan to say something about hal phillip walker, would not that be something?
well -- maybe. let's see what happens here.
I will be dammed.
have your children been deaf since birth?
yes -- yes, they have. it was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but delbert and i have been blessed by their being here.
when did you start singing?
when i was little, in church.
is not it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
yes, it is --
well, can you tell me why?
it just is.
how long have you been with them?
about three years.
and before?
just my church and my boys. we all had to go to school and learn hand talking. i just thank the lord they can see.
do you ever do any writing?
no, i don't.
are you a close friend of haven's?
no, mostly his wife's. she is in paris, france, right now. my husband delbert is real friendly with him. delbert's in law. does work for him.
do you like him?
he is a member of our congregation.
you got the money?
right here.
well, do not lose it. last time i gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
well, that just happened that time.
well, it better not happen again.
you lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near christmas time -- i remember that real well now. december 9th, to be exact.
you got a real good memory, star.
i remember when i just saw you. skinny winnifred. jesus, you were skinny.
what do you have to buy?
feed, mostly. thought we would get something for the kids.
okay by me - I would sure like to see that opryland.
what?
grand old opera --
i hate that music.
i know that, star.
have you seen a woman about so high?
no.
she had on high heels?
no.
need a ride?
I am sorry. i feel as if i know you. I am john triplette... a friend of del reese... i was at the airport. i just wanted to introduce myself. I am a great fan of hers. if there is anything you need, just give me a call. I am at the sheraton south.
she is going to rest now.
okay, i just wanted to see if i could help out at all.
i appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
oh, sure.
what do you really want?
not a thing, barnett, really. i need a little information. but, ah, it can wait.
you bet.
okay. thanks.
we just got a gold record.
do they have a show to give it to you?
no  hell, some secretary in new york just hands it to you. only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
did it break?
dent it a little. boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. she had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
how long have you been together?
probably a little too long.
do you study at all?
depends on what I am studying.
i can do benefits
how much?
i can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.
money's no object.
are you sure you know what you are doing?
hundreds of times.
well, there is a couple of girls in printers alley if you got any questions. i know I have seen that g- string stuff for sale someplace around.
do not you worry about sueleen gay.
that is for sure. at the airport - that is where it was. at the airport, there in one of those gift shops... anyway, you better take a break.
thanks. you are just a wonderful person.
hello.
linnea?
yes. who is this?
I am here.
who is this?
tom. you remember?
I am not sure. where?
remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
yes.
well, i met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
oh, tom, of course. what are you doing in nashville?
I would really like to see you.
or course. you should come over to the house. the boys would love to meet you.
that is not quite what i had in mind.
well...how have you been?
well, they removed my heart last week, but I am doing fine except my nose fell off. looks a little funny.
hey, there - you seen my winifred?
no.
you got a place to stay?
no. probably stay at a motel tonight.
you in music?
no.
get in.
come on back to bed.
yeah, you bet. you are really terrific. you know what i mean?
come on.
just a minute.
hello.
hi.
who is thin?
who is this?  it is tom.
i do not know who you are.
what do you mean?  you said you wanted to see me.
yes, sir.
can i help you?
yes, sir. i need a room
i think we can do that. come in.
i did not think it would. she is calling herself l.a. joan this- week. last week it was dakota. guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything.
she sure sings nice.
my wife and i think so, but we are family. your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. what do you do, pick or sing?
oh... a little of both. just thought I would look around at nashville for a while.
when you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at bishop's pub. they let you pass the hat. all these kids do that. most every place does not want to bother with you.
I am not really a musician.
well, do not be shy. i got the address here. anytime you need it. room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.
suits me.
listen, do you know anything about cars?
a little. what do you need?
hi. look at those flowers. did you grow those.
ester and me did;  my niece picked then. she is just here from california.
that is good,  I have never seen anything so healthy.
i called connie and she said not to worry, she will fill in for you.
i see.
sorry I am late.
you are not.
where is bill?
sleeping.
where are you going?
out.
he got killed at a turkey shoot.
your brother?
yes. i was in my sophomore year at harvard.
harvard?
business school so i can run haven's business.
what is a turkey shoot.
you go out in the woods and shoot targets -- whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey
how in the world did he get shot?
some guy was drunk and hit him. accident. haven almost killed him.
sorry to bother you, bud.
yes, sir. like you to meet opal.
need to have you check these out before he goes on that walker benefit.
sure thing. put them here... I will take them.
thanks... i'll... go say hello to your mom.
she is in paris.
oh... well... have you heard from barnett?
not yet.
let me know when you do, all right?
you bet.
I will just be in here.
do you know barbara jean?
sure do. good friend of haven's.
haven's not going to talk to me.
sure he will.
hi.
hello.
I am opal.
oh yes, I am john triplette.
I am gathering information about the characteristics of music people. i just finished a documentary on gandi.
the architect  his buildings are drippy. you know, like sand and castles. then i got this assignment. they want to start in two weeks.
why?
why?
what?
what? oh. a film.
barnett, please -
what is wrong honey.
i do not want to listen to her sing -
do not feel that way, honey.
then why are you listening to her -
well, i have to go thank her for filling in and it is nice to know the tune she sang.
you have to what?
go to the king of the road and thank her.
barnett?
what?
am i disturbing you?
I am really all right, barnett. do not you worry really... i just do not want you to leave me that is all.
oh, honey, i did not mean to scare you.
how did you come in here?
well, my wife, ester's down the hall. i saw barnett leaving and i was just talking to ester about your being here.	she loves you so much, i just had to come down and say hello. we have been following you since you were a girl. well, i just scared you to death. i did not mean to do that.
well, i guess you caught me at a weak moment.
you will have to speak up.
i said, I have been real tired.
eater  says she does not see how you do it.
what is wrong with her.
oh just about everything, i guess. those doctors started on an overhaul and do not want to quit. they keep taking things out. she is going to come home an egg shell. tough, though.. she is tough.
what did you say your name was?
green.
well, mr. green.
hi, sherry.
how did you get in here.
it is fine. we were just talking about vitamin s.
I will go on. ester'1l be very glad.

I have been a little dyspeptic.
i want to get the dog off my bed.
