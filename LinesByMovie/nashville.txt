you want a ride into town?
you bet.
got me an audition tonight.
well, you just remember, if you can't kick front, kick back, 'cause at least you're kicking... ten minutes, okay?
he's my father.
haven hamilton is your father? can you arrange an interview?
did you see who that was?
glad to see you. ester'll be glad, too.
he is just wonderful.
i'1l get your bag.
pleasure
where is she?
uh huh.
she's been in the hospital two weeks yesterday.
you know anything about the stations here?
it's hard to say. doctors thought she'd come home a week ago. all it was was appendix.
all they got is advertisements. just like l.a.
did an exploratory and according to them, she needed an overhaul.
well, i could use one, especially if i'm pregnant.
what did you say?
i said, maybe i'll change my name again.
i see... well, those doctors are real miracle workers.
but not unless nashville really inspires me.
maybe you can look after me a little.
that tom sure is cute.
no -- that's exercises. my coach says you have to do exercise because the vocal chords are muscle and need to be stretched. every time you stretch them, the middle part sets stronger. that's the place where i sing.
you think i got any kind of a voice?
you sure do it loud.
is that good?
it's not bad.
you think i should take lessons?
if you're serious. being serious is real important.
you serious?
wade -- i've been working toward this audition for years.
well, honey, i sure hope it comes your way then.
you think it will?
sure thing.
what do you think of him?
hal? well, hal and i have been friends for a long time.
you go to school together?
no, we never did that
oh --
we're connected by a relative. one time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. that was a long time ago, though. how'd you come to work for him?
well, i really think he's got a chance.
you do?
oh yea -- there has never been a better time for something new.
he ain't really new.
he is to a lot of people.
he was a good judge, but that was a long time ago.
you know, i'll bet you he makes it with a majority.
where are you from?
southern california.
you always live there?
spent time in arizona. why?
well, i admire your optimism, and i just wondered if it was regional. you ever see any movie stars?
i know a couple.
no kidding -- wait till i tell linnea. who?
ah... peter finch.
who?
peter finch -- he's english.
i never heard of him. name somebody else.
ryan o'neal.
you really do?  ~ god -- how come you know them?
oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
i'll be damned. boy, if you could get ryan to say something about hal phillip walker, wouldn't that be something?
well -- maybe. let's see what happens here.
i'll be dammed.
have your children been deaf since birth?
yes -- yes, they have. it was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but delbert and i have been blessed by their being here.
when did you start singing?
when i was little, in church.
isn't it unusual for you to be working with a black choir?
yes, it is --
well, can you tell me why?
it just is.
how long have you been with them?
about three years.
and before?
just my church and my boys. we all had to go to school and learn hand talking. i just thank the lord they can see.
do you ever do any writing?
no, i don't.
are you a close friend of haven's?
no, mostly his wife's. she's in paris, france, right now. my husband delbert is real friendly with him. delbert's in law. does work for him.
do you like him?
he's a member of our congregation.
you got the money?
right here.
well, don't lose it. last time i gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
well, that just happened that time.
well, it better not happen again.
you lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near christmas time -- i remember that real well now. december 9th, to be exact.
you got a real good memory, star.
i remember when i just saw you. skinny winnifred. jesus, you were skinny.
what do you have to buy?
feed, mostly. thought we'd get something for the kids.
okay by me - i'd sure like to see that opryland.
what?
grand old opera --
i hate that music.
i know that, star.
have you seen a woman about so high?
no.
she had on high heels?
no.
need a ride?
i'm sorry. i feel as if i know you. i'm john triplette... a friend of del reese... i was at the airport. i just wanted to introduce myself. i'm a great fan of hers. if there's anything you need, just give me a call. i'm at the sheraton south.
she's going to rest now.
okay, i just wanted to see if i could help out at all.
i appreciate your concern, but she has to rest, so you can go on home.
oh, sure.
what do you really want?
not a thing, barnett, really. i need a little information. but, ah, it can wait.
you bet.
okay. thanks.
we just got a gold record.
do they have a show to give it to you?
no  hell, some secretary in new york just hands it to you. only this one kept dropping it out of the box.
did it break?
dent it a little. boy -- just she couldn1t even find it. she had a hamburger on her desk that looked three weeks old.
how long have you been together?
probably a little too long.
do you study at all?
depends on what i'm studying.
i can do benefits
how much?
i can only give you fifty a week here and ten bucks for the benefit.
money's no object.
are you sure you know what you're doing?
hundreds of times.
well, there's a couple of girls in printers alley if you got any questions. i know i've seen that g- string stuff for sale someplace around.
don't you worry about sueleen gay.
that's for sure. at the airport - that's where it was. at the airport, there in one of those gift shops... anyway, you better take a break.
thanks. you are just a wonderful person.
hello.
linnea?
yes. who's this?
i'm here.
who is this?
tom. you remember?
i'm not sure. where?
remember, about a month ago, your church choir cut a record?
yes.
well, i met you that afternoon in the control room and we...
oh, tom, of course. what are you doing in nashville?
i'd really like to see you.
or course. you should come over to the house. the boys would love to meet you.
that's not quite what i had in mind.
well...how have you been?
well, they removed my heart last week, but i'm doing fine except my nose fell off. looks a little funny.
hey, there - you seen my winifred?
no.
you got a place to stay?
no. probably stay at a motel tonight.
you in music?
no.
get in.
come on back to bed.
yeah, you bet. you're really terrific. you know what i mean?
come on.
just a minute.
hello.
hi.
who is thin?
who is this?  it's tom.
i don't know who you are.
what do you mean?  you said you wanted to see me.
yes, sir.
can i help you?
yes, sir. i need a room
i think we can do that. come in.
i didn't think it would. she's calling herself l.a. joan this- week. last week it was dakota. guess if you have to change your name a state's as good as anything.
she sure sings nice.
my wife and i think so, but we're family. your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. what do you do, pick or sing?
oh... a little of both. just thought i'd look around at nashville for a while.
when you run out or money, 'cause you will here, you can go sing at bishop's pub. they let you pass the hat. all these kids do that. most every place doesn't want to bother with you.
i'm not really a musician.
well, don't be shy. i got the address here. anytime you need it. room's twenty-five dollar! a week and you can have breakfast with me if you like.
suits me.
listen, do you know anything about cars?
a little. what do you need?
hi. look at those flowers. did you grow those.
ester and me did;  my niece picked then. she's just here from california.
that's good,  i've never seen anything so healthy.
i called connie and she said not to worry, she'll fill in for you.
i see.
sorry i'm late.
you're not.
where's bill?
sleeping.
where are you going?
out.
he got killed at a turkey shoot.
your brother?
yes. i was in my sophomore year at harvard.
harvard?
business school so i can run haven's business.
what is a turkey shoot.
you go out in the woods and shoot targets -- whoever shoots the most wins a live turkey
how in the world did he get shot?
some guy was drunk and hit him. accident. haven almost killed him.
sorry to bother you, bud.
yes, sir. like you to meet opal.
need to have you check these out before he goes on that walker benefit.
sure thing. put them here... i'll take them.
thanks... i'll... go say hello to your mom.
she's in paris.
oh... well... have you heard from barnett?
not yet.
let me know when you do, all right?
you bet.
i'll just be in here.
do you know barbara jean?
sure do. good friend of haven's.
haven's not going to talk to me.
sure he will.
hi.
hello.
i'm opal.
oh yes, i'm john triplette.
i'm gathering information about the characteristics of music people. i just finished a documentary on gandi.
the architect  his buildings are drippy. you know, like sand and castles. then i got this assignment. they want to start in two weeks.
why?
why?
what?
what? oh. a film.
barnett, please -
what's wrong honey.
i don't want to listen to her sing -
don't feel that way, honey.
then why are you listening to her -
well, i have to go thank her for filling in and it's nice to know the tune she sang.
you have to what?
go to the king of the road and thank her.
barnett?
what?
am i disturbing you?
i'm really all right, barnett. don't you worry really... i just don't want you to leave me that's all.
oh, honey, i didn't mean to scare you.
how did you come in here?
well, my wife, ester's down the hall. i saw barnett leaving and i was just talking to ester about your being here.	she loves you so much, i just had to come down and say hello. we've been following you since you were a girl. well, i just scared you to death. i didn't mean to do that.
well, i guess you caught me at a weak moment.
you'll have to speak up.
i said, i've been real tired.
eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
what's wrong with her.
oh just about everything, i guess. those doctors started on an overhaul and don't want to quit. they keep taking things out. she's going to come home an egg shell. tough, though.. she's tough.
what did you say your name was?
green.
well, mr. green.
hi, sherry.
how'd you get in here.
it's fine. we were just talking about vitamin s.
i'll go on. ester'1l be very glad.

president.
president?

wednesday at the park. we've got a lot of names coming in...
for him?
yes.
national television?

what for?
you're real favorites of his.
you're kidding.
how come?
where'd he ever see us?
d.c.
d.c.?  tammany hall?  he came there?

you don't know how pleased he'll be.
what!
okay.
okay.
how's your stomach?
pretty good. sure was surprised to hear from you. you talk to bill?

next you'll be sick.
i feel really good.
how are you going to pay when you get sick?
i'm in a rooming house with mr. green.
green?  not owen green. owen green embezzled money from your grandfather
i don't know his first name.
bet the sheets are grey.
no. no, they're white. he's got a nice dog.
worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
fungus?
he doesn1t have fungus, does he?
i don't think so.
well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
how do you know if they do?
weather's been awful. all those bombs dropping. it changes our weather. sure not like the good old days.
does their hair fall out?
your hair fell out? just like your father. weak hair.
listen. maybe i should go...
i've been a little dyspeptic.
i want to get the dog off my bed.
but, i'll take some of that nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
okay. i'll be talking to you.

i'm john triplette. excuse me. i got all caught up in looking at you. you'll be fine.
oh, why thank you.
may i see your costume?
now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. the more you take off, you see, more money we can raise.
i see.
i know that you are an artist and i am sure you are very religious.
don't you think they'd just love another song instead?
now, sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room.
i was in prison for twenty-eight years.
oh.
premeditated murder.
oh.
just got out. had me thirteen lawyers. missed the electric chair twice. .. been out three months. are you heavy?
i'm not sure...
i'm forty-six. do you like to go up or down?

my mother. died in '72. they told me after. they said they couldn't find me before, so they told us after.

they said go see the chaplain.
i'm sorry but i have to go.
well, that's not entirely true, barnett. at least not according to haven.
haven? hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
i guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
he knows better.
well, it's probably because it would help him.
how is that?
everybody likes to be as good as their word.
whose word?
his word.
his word? are you telling me haven promised you something?
that's pretty close. he's going to be on the bill. why not put barbara jean on with him?
oh, barnett, i'm so sorry.

all those people...
don't worry, i'll take care or it
