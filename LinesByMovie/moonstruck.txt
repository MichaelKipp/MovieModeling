are you ready?
hello, bobo. how are you tonight?
very good, mr. johnny.
we will both have the salad ticino.
uh-huh
and i'll have the special fish.
you don't want the fish.
no?
it's the oily fish tonight. not before the plane ride.
maybe you're right.
give him the manicotta, bobo. me, too.
yes?
could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
but absolutely!
a man who can't control his woman is funny.
she was too young for him.
can i get another one of these?
definitely!
may i presume to ask you a question?
sure!
do you have a girlfriend?
i am alone in the world.
no, i want to see the dessert cart.
very good.
you never have dessert.
never is a long time.
what's the matter?
my scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
have something.
i shouldn't.
will you marry me?
what?
will you marry me?
bobo, take the cart away.
are you proposing marriage to me?
yes?
you know i was married and that my husband died. but what you don't know is i think he and i had bad luck.
what do you mean?
we got married at the city hall and i think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
i don't understand.
right from the start we didn't do it right. could you kneel down?
on the floor?
yes, on the floor.
this is a good suit.
i helped you buy it. it came with two pairs of pants. it's for luck, johnny. when you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
alright.
i like this ring.
you propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
when i was twenty-seven years old, in jersey city, i asked a woman to marry me. she had red hair. she smelled a jasmine. she wore black shoes with pointy white tips.
what happened?
she didn't hear me. she asked me to repeat, so she could understand what i said. but i wouldn't repeat it. outta shyness. so i'm a bachelor.
what time is it?
seven-thirty.
so we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time.
i forgot to bring the champagne, mr. johnny.
i forgot to wave. we'll have it at the wedding.
what about the wedding?
my mother is dying. when she is dead, i'll come back and we'll be married.
how near is she to death?
a week. two weeks. no more.
then let's set the date.
how about a month from today?
must it be so definite? can't we just say that we will be married when i get back?
where? at the city hall? no! i want the whole wedding or we will have bad luck. for a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
alright. a month. in a month.
a month from today?
yeah.
i'll take care of it, johnny. i'll take care of the whole thing. all you have to do is show up.
oh, you're not going. you're staying.
no, i'm going.
the shawfish?
just across the bay, at the fuel depot. the men wanted to try to get home. i can't explain.
then, i suppose the time has come say it's been nice dwight lionel. it's been everything. oh, dwight, i'm frightened.
i know, i am so sorry for so many things. i love you, moira. i love you. i love you.
i'll call you when i get to mama's house.
you've made me very happy, johnny.
there's one thing about this wedding i want you to do. call this number. it's a business number. ask for ronny. invite him to the wedding.
who is he?
he's my younger brother.
you have a brother?
we haven't spoken in five years. there was some bad blood. i want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. will you do it?
sure.
where's ma?
bed.
you're not sleepy?
i can't sleep anymore. it's too much like death.
pop, i got news.
here.  ti amo.
ti amo.
you look tired.
what's your news?
i'm getting married.
again?
yeah.
you did this once it didn't work out.
the guy died.
what killed him?
he got hit by a bus.
no! bad luck! your ma and i been married fifty-two years an nobody died. you were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. don't get married again, loretta. it don't work out for you. who's the man?
johnny cammareri.
him? he's a big baby. why isn't he here with you telling me?
he's flying to sicily. his mother's dying.
more bad luck! i don't like his face, loretta. i don't like his lips. when he smiles i can't see his teeth. when will you do it?
in a month.
i won't come.
you've got to come. you've got to give me away.
i didn't give you away the first time.
and maybe that's why i had the bad luck. maybe if you gave me away, and i got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the city hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then i wouldn't had the bad luck i had.
maybe.
i didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at the grand ticino.
he did?
yeah.
that don't sound like johnny. where's the ring?
here.
it looks stupid. it's a pinky ring. it's a man's ring.
it's temporary.
everything is temporary. that don't excuse nothing.
so you'll come to the wedding, right?
let's go tell your mother.
who's dead?
nobody. loretta is getting married.
again? johnny cammareri.
i don't like him.
you're not gonna marry him, cosmo. do you love him, loretta?
no.
good. when you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. but you like him?
oh yeah. he's a sweet man. i wanna have a big church wedding, ma. and a reception.
and who's gonna pay for that?
pop.
i have no money!
you're rich as roosevelt. you're just cheap, cosmo.
i won't pay for nothing.
he didn't used to be cheap. he thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.
it's wrong to just let them go.
good morning, lucy.
what do you want me to do? pick up after five dogs? i'm eighty-three years old. god in his heaven understands that i cannot pick up after five dogs.
you have too many dogs.
lucy. there are big things going on in my house. my granddaughter loretta, the only daughter of my son cosmo, has engaged herself to be married a second time.
i have heard that johnny cammareri got down on his knees in the grand ticino and proposed to her.
my son does not like this johnny cammareri. he says he is a big baby.
don't fight.
my granddaughter wants my son to pay for the wedding. but he does not want to pay.
he should pay.
i don't know.
he owes her a wedding from the first time when there was none.
maybe. i don't know. he has not asked my advice. if he asks my advice, i don't know what i will say.
i won't have to shoot those dogs. they will kill each other.
you think so, huh, stupid? those dogs love each other.
will you live here?
no.
why not?
pop don't like johnny.
so we'll sell the house.
i got married before, you didn't sell.
grandma was still alive. chiro was still home going to school. now he's married and gone to florida. if you and johnny moved in, had a baby...
i'm thirty-seven years old.
what's thirty-seven? i had chiro after i was thirty-seven. it ain't over till it's over.
johnny has a big apartment. we'll live there.
and we'll sell the house.
i'd like to stay, ma. i love the house. but pop don't like johnny.
no. he don't.
ssh, it's me. i'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.
how was your plane ride?
the waitresses were very nice.  my mother is slipping away.
have you told her we're getting married?
not yet. i'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
how's the mother?
she's dying. but i could still hear her big mouth.
did he tell her?
not yet. that old lady makes him sweat.  where's that card?
yeah, this is ronny.
i'm calling for your brother johnny. he's getting married and he wants you to come.
why didn't he call himself?
he's in palermo.
what's wrong can never be made right.
let me come and talk to you.
have you come from my brother?
yes.
why?
i'm going to marry him.
you are going to marry my brother?
yes. do you want...
i have no life.
excuse me.
i have no life. my brother johnny took my life from me.
i don't understand.
gimme the big knife! i'm gonna cut my throat!
maybe i should come back another time.
no, i want you to see this! i want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! chrissy, gimme the big knife!
it's wood. it's fake. five years ago i was engaged to be married. johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. i put it in the slicer and i talked with him and my hand got caught cause i wasn't paying attention. the slicer chewed off my hand. it's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that i was maimed, she left me for another man.
that's the bad blood between you and johnny?
that's it.
but that wasn't johnny's fault.
i don't care! i ain't no freakin monument to justice! i lost my hand, i lost my bride! johnny has his hand, johnny has his bride! you come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget?
and then there is copper, which is the only pipe i use. it costs money. but it costs money because it saves money.
and what did they say?
the man understood me. the woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that i was right.
you have such a head for knowing. you know everything.
i brought you something.
oh, cosmo!
they are little stars and birds. birds fly to the stars, i guess.
loretta. what's that smell?
i'm making you a steak.
you don't have to help me.
i know that. i do what i want.
i like it well done.
you'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
this is good. uhh...
loretta.
where'd johnny find you?
he knew my husband who died.
how'd he die?
bus hit him.
fast.
instantaneous.
when you get engaged?
yesterday.
why?
why what?
i don't know.
so. five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. no woman since then?
no.
stupid.
when your husband get hit by the bus?
seven years ago.
how many men since then?
just johnny.
stupid yourself.
no. unlucky. i have not been lucky.
i don't care about luck, you understand me? it ain't that.
what? do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
why you talking to me?
you got any whiskey? how 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
she was right to leave me.
you think so?
yes.
you really are stupid, you know that.
you don't know nothing about it.
i was raised that a girl gets married young. i didn't get married until i was twenty-eight. i met a man. i loved him. i married him. he wanted to have a baby right away. i said no. then he got hit by a bus. no man. no baby. no nothing! i did not know that man was a gift i could not keep. i didn't know... you tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but i see what the true story is, and you can't.  she didn't leave you! you can't see what you are. i can see everything. you are a wolf!
i'm a wolf?
the big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. this woman was a trap for you. she caught you and you could not get away.  so you chewed off your foot! that was the price you had to pay to be free.  johnny had nothing to do with it. you did what you had to do, between you and you, and i know i'm right, i don't care what you say. and now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. that's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. you are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
what are you doing!
i'm telling you your life!
stop it!
no!
why are you marrying johnny? he's a fool!
because i have no luck!
he made me look the wrong way and i cut off my hand. he could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
i am looking where i should to become a bride!
a bride without a head!
a wolf without a foot!
son of a bitch!
where are you taking me?
to the bed.
oh. oh god. i don't care about anything. i don't care about anything! take me to the bed.
i can't believe what is happening.
me neither.
i was dead.
i was dead, too.
your blood.
all my life i have never reached a man. i knew that i would reach my husband, but i took my time and he was dead. ronny.
loretta.
i want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. i want you to swallow me.
i've got you.
get all of me. take everything.
what about johnny?
you're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. suck me dry!
alright. alright. there will be nothing left.
i don't wanna talk about it.
johnny cammareri. i think it's great and about time. what's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
i don't wanna talk about it.
cosmo. many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, i was happy. when i told rose i was marrying rita, she was happy.
marriage is happy news.
rose, pass the wine.
i never seen anybody so in love like cosmo back then! he'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. i never told you this cause it's not really a story. but one time i woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. like a flashlight. i couldn't think a what it was. i looked out the window, and it was the moon! big as a house! i never seen the moon so big before or since. i was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. and i looked down, and standing there in the street was cosmo, looking up at the windows. this is the funny part. i got mad at you, cosmo! i thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. i was half asleep i guess and didn't know no better.
you were altogether asleep. you were dreaming.
no. you were there.
i don't wanna talk about it.
well, what do you wanna talk about!
rita. pass the wine.
why you drinking so much?
what?
that light.
i don't know. i think it's the moon.
it's so bright.
i've never seen a moon like that.
it makes you look like an angel.
rita. rita.
what? what?
look.
oh.
it's cosmo's moon.
what are you talking about, raymond? cosmo can't own the moon.
i mean it's that moon i was talking about at dinner.  is he down there? no.
is who down there?
cosmo.
what would he be doing down there?
i don't know.
you know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
oh my god.
what?
what? what have we done?
take it easy.
this time i was trying to do everything right.
don't just become excited.
i thought if i stayed away from the city hall, i won't have that bad luck i had again.
you're trying to make me feel guilty.
i'm marrying your brother!
all right, i'm guilty. i confess!
you're invited to the wedding! it's in a few weeks. why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in palermo?
she didn't like me.
you don't get along with anybody!
what did you do?
what did i do?
you ruined my life.
that's impossible! it was ruint when i got here! you ruint my life!
oh no i didn't!
oh yes, oh yes you did! you've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! why didn't i see it yesterday! bad luck! is that all i'm ever gonna have? why didn't i just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? i'm gonna marry him!
what?
last night never happened, you hear me? i'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and i are gonna take this to our coffins!
i can't do that!
why not?
i'm in love with you!
snap out of it!
i can't!
alright. then i must never see you again. the bad blood will have to stay there between you and johnny for all time. you won't come to the wedding.
i'll come to the wedding.
i'm telling you you can't.
but he wants me to come!
but that's cause he don't know!
alright. i will not come. provided one thing.
what?
that you come with me tonight. once. to the opera.
what are you talking about?
i love two things. i love you, and i love the opera. if i can have the two things that i love together for one night, i will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
alright.
alright. meet me at the met.
alright. where's the met?
bless me, father, for i have sinned. it's been two months since my last confession.
what sins have you to confess?
twice i took the name of god in vain, once i slept with the brother of my fiancé, and once i bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
then it was not a sin. but what was that second thing you said, loretta?
i... a... slept with my fiancé's brother.
that's a pretty big sin.
i know.
you should think about this.
i know.
alright. this is your penance. say two rosaries and... be careful, loretta. reflect on your life.
alright.
i absolve you in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy spirit, amen.
hi.
where you been?
i don't wanna talk about it.
just like your father. i lied to him. he thinks you came home last night.
thanks. what's the matter with you?
cosmo's cheating on me.
what! how do you know?
a wife knows.
then you don't know. you're just imagining it. he's too old.
i feel great i got no sleep but i feel like orlando furioso!
you were a tiger last night.
and you were a lamb. as soft as milk.
shut up. they'll hear you in the back.
so what? the pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. hey, how about a date tonight, rita. let's eat pasta and roll around.
raymond, raymond, lower your voice! what's got into you?
i don't know! that moon! that crazy moon cosmo sent over!
hi.
hey there  ...you with the stars in your eyes...
what's the matter with him?
you got me.
you see that moon last night?
what about the moon?
did you see it?
no.
oh.
listen, i gotta go. i'll take the deposit to the bank but i'll do the books tomorrow. i gotta go.
you gotta date?
what are you talking about, you fool? her fiancé's in palermo.
oh. right.
i got things to do.
sure you do. you got all that wedding stuff.
right.
what's the matter? you look crazy.
i got a lot on my mind, aunt rita.
at dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. things are very bad in my house.
hurry up.
don't fight.
if i hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. if i am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick.
we're supposed to do fifty apples. we only got twelve done.
i don't know what to advise my son. i think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous.
don't make yourself sick.
cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner.
talk to him.
i will. but i must find the right moment.
did you see the moon last night?
yes!
hurry up, hurry up. we open in five minutes.
bye, aunt rita.
bye, bye, honey. see you tomorrow?
yeah, i'll be in.
hi.
hi.
you look beautiful. your hair...
i thought i'd try it.  you look good.
thank you.
who painted that?
marc chagall. a russian.
kinda gaudy.
he was having some fun. yeah, well he's dead.  come on, let's go in.
thank you!
for what?
i don't know. for your hair. for your beautiful dress. for... you know, i feel like a man again. you know i love the opera. you know it's been a long time since i've been to the opera.
so. where are we sitting?
come on.
don't mind about me. but could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?
absolutely!
i'm sorry if we disturbed you.
i'm not disturbed. by you.
my lady friend has a personality disorder.
she was just too young for you.
thanks, comrade.
it's nothing!
ouch. too young! i just got that. you know how to hurt guy. how old are you?
none of your business.
sorry. that was rude.
will you join me for dinner?
are you sure?
then i'd be delighted. i hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often i end up doing just that.
what do you do?
i'm a professor. i teach communications at n.y.u.
that woman was a student of yours?
sheila? yes she was. is. was.
there's old saying my mother told me. would you like to hear it?
yes.
don't shit where you eat.
i'll remember that. what do you do?
i'm a housewife.
then why are you eating alone?
i'm not eating alone. can i ask you a question?
go ahead.
why do men chase women?
nerves.
i think it's because they fear death.
maybe. listen. you wanna know why i chase women? i find women charming.
i teach these classes i've taught for a million years. the spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. i started off, i was excited about something and i wanted to share it. now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. except sometimes. sometimes i'm droning along and i look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and i'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. and when that happens, when i look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way i always wanted to be and maybe once was, then i ask her out on a date. it doesn't last. it can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that i'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. and at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
what you don't know about women is a lot.
they get some turnout for this stuff.
it's the best thing there is.
i like parts of it, but i don't really get it.
you haven't once said you like my dress.
i like your dress.  it's very bright.
why you looking around so much?
i don't know. i got a feeling.
i'm wearing your bracelet.
may i walk with you a ways?
sure.
you knew that man?
yes.
that was just so... awful!
awful?
beautiful. sad. she died!
yeah.
i couldn't believe it! i didn't think she was going to die. i knew she was sick...
mona?
what'd you do to your hair?
i got it done.
what are you doing here?
what are you doing here?
who is this man? you're engaged!
you're married.
you're my daughter. i won't have you acting like a tramp!
you're my father.
alright. i didn't see you here.
i don't know whether i saw you or not.
that's my house.
you mean the whole house?
yes.
my god, it's a mansion!
it's a house.
i live in a one-bedroom apartment. what exactly does your husband do?
he's a plumber.
well. that explains it.
temperature's dropping.
yes.
i guess you can't invite me in?
no.
people home.
no. i think the house is empty. i can't invite you in because i'm married and because i know who i am. you're shaking.
i'm a little cold.
you're a little boy and you like to be bad.
we could go to my apartment. you could see how the other half lives.
i'm too old for you.
i'm too old for me. that's my predicament.
good night.
good night. can i kiss you on the cheek, too?
sure.
i'm freezing
good night.
no thanks.
i think that's it.
what do you want to do now?
i wanna go home.
it's really cold.
yeah. it smells like snow.
what's the matter?
how can you ask me that?
you're making me feel guilty again.
you are guilty. i'm guilty.
of what? only god can point the finger, loretta.
i know what i know.
and what do you know? you tell me my life? i'll tell you yours. i'm a wolf? you run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! you're gonna marry my brother? why you wanna sell your life short? playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. you waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
he didn't come!
i'm here!
you're late!
we're here.
this is your place.
that's right.
this is where we're going!
yeah.
the deal was if i came to the opera with you you'd leave me alone forever.
i went with you.  now i'm gonna marry johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  right?  a person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their luck. maybe my nature does draw me to you, but i don't haveta go with that. i can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! i can do that. otherwise, what is this stupid life that god gave us for what?  ronny? are you listening to me?
yeah.
i'm really afraid.
why?
i'm afraid of who i am.
i was.
and you're not now?
why not?
i don't know. everything seems like nothing now against that i want you in my bed. i don't care if i burn in hell. i don't care if you burn in hell. the past and future is a joke to me now. i see that they're nothing, i see they ain't here. the only thing that's here is you. and me. i want you to come upstairs. now. i tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but i couldn't. i couldn't take everything in a hundred years. it's the way we are. we compound each other.
let me go home.
no.
let me go home.
no.
i'm freezing to death.
come upstairs. i don't care why you come. no, that's not what i mean. loretta, i love you. not like they told you love is and i didn't know this either. but love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. we're not here to make things perfect. snowflakes are perfect. the stars are perfect. not us. we are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! the storybooks are bullshit. come upstairs with me, baby! don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! red meat just like me! it's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! you're a wolf just like me! come upstairs with me and get in my bed! come on! come on! come on!
moving in?
i came right from the airport.
come on in.
can you wake up loretta? i need to talk to her.
she's not home yet. take off your coat and come in the living room. i'll make you a drink. i wanna talk to you.
so.
where is she?
out. i don't know where. i was waiting up for my husband.
it's late.
yes.
maybe i should go?
what are you doing here? you're supposed to be in palermo.
that's what i came to tell loretta. there's been a miracle.
a miracle. well, that's news.
my mother's recovered.
you're kidding?
the breath had almost totally left her body. she was as white as snow. and then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. the mourners. and me. and herself! she ate a meal that would choke a pig!
that's incredible.
yes.
who was that?
that was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. listen, johnny, there's a question i want to ask you. and i want you to tell me the truth if you can. why do men chase women?
well. there's the bible story. god took a rib from adam and made eve. maybe men chase women to get the rib back. when god took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
but why would a man need more than one woman?
i don't know. maybe because he fears death.
that's it! that's the reason!
i don't know.
no, that's really it. thank you for answering my question.
hi.  hi.
hello, mr. castorini.
where you been?
i don't know, rose. i don't know where i've been, and i don't know where i'm going.  you should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
i have my eyes open.
you do, huh? stick around. don't go on any long trips.
i don't know what you mean.
i know you don't. that's the point. i'll say no more.
you haven't said anything.
and that's how much i'm saying.
cosmo?
what?
i just want you to know. no matter what you do. you are going to die, just like everybody else.
thank you, rose.

is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
you? no.
we just come from the bank.
the bank. oh my god, i forgot to make the deposit!
she's got it.
i knew she had it.
we didn't know what to think. you were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
we never suspected you!
it's johnny cammareri.
johnny.
loretta...
johnny...
ronny! our mother has recovered from death!
good.
have you come to make peace with me?
well. yeah. you may not want to.
of course i want to.
i don't know. but johnny, how did your mother recover? she was dying.
we should talk alone.
i can't. i need my family around me now.
well. i told my mother that we were to be married. and she got well. right away.
i'm sure she did.
it was a miracle!
johnny, i have something to tell you.
i have something to tell you. but i must talk to you alone.
i have no secrets from my family.
loretta, i can't marry you.
what?
if i marry you my mother will die.
what the hell are you talking about? we're engaged.
loretta, what are you talking about?
i'm talking about a promise. you proposed to me!
because my mother was dying! but now she's not.
you're forty-two years old, johnny, and mama is still running your life.
and you are a son who doesn't love his mother!
and you're a big liar! i've got your ring here!
i must ask for that back.
in time, you will see that this is the best thing.
in time, you will drop dead, and i will come to your funeral in a red dress.
loretta?
what!
will you marry me.
what?
where's the ring?
will you marry me, loretta castorini clark?
before all these people, yes, i will marry you, ronny cammareri!
do you love him, loretta?
yeah, ma, i love him awful.
oh god, that's too bad.
