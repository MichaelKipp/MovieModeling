when were you going to tell me you were not going with us?
i still have work to do here.
i don't believe you.  my father was explaining to mr. griffin.  that is how i found out.
i was trying to find the right time.
after i left?
i will not have friends in america.
soon young, don't worry.  you will have many friends very soon.  you will see.  america is a very friendly place.
you don't move, you understand?!  you don't move!
do i look like i'm movin'?!  what you're seeing here?  this is not movement. this is my "still".
hey, hey, you start touching me there, i'm gonna start movin'! word up, mother...
shut up!
you a cop or something?
or somethin'.
this is not a good way to start a relationship, stickin' a gun to a man's head, feelin' around his personal equipment.  make him think you don't trust him.
i don't trust anybody.  especially first time deals.
i oughta pat your ass down.  make sure you're not a cop.
nobody touches me.
shit, i ain't interested in puttin' my hands on you.  that does nothin' for me.  no. i don't need to be pattin' no ass. all i'm sayin' is, how do i know you're not a cop?
yeah...beautiful. what would you call that paper there? kind of a...robin egg blue color?
good. that's standard military packaging for plastique. get a look under it.
you know something? every time i see this stuff, it reminds me of...uh...a double latte grande...  with two shots of non-fat milk.
what are you talking about?
what's this little green wire coming out one side of the package?
i wouldn't touch that if i were you.
okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. you cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  i will leave him on this side.  then we trade places.  you get him, i get her.  get the picture, lois?
do it!
not anymore.
where'd you get it?
i would like one of my people to help.
ambassador, let me assure you that the fbi has made this a top priority. we have plenty of manpower on the case.
he is very good.
as i said, sir, we've got all the people we need.
i am not an american, mr. russ.  my daughter is not an american.
i understand, sir. but you are an honored guest of the united states...
he is already on the plane.  i hope you will treat him with the same respect you have shown me.
you're killin' me here.
carter, just because you saved my butt, doesn't mean it's yours.
oh, baby, you cruel...
last night's as much my fault as yours.  if he's gonna put the blame on anybody --
hey, i was senior. it's ok. this is why i get the big bucks.
i don't know what went wrong last night, but this department could've lost one detective and our only explosives expert.
sir, i can explain.
what you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
i know, but --
that's probably the only reason johnson's still alive.
good job.
hey, sir, it was a pleasure to preserve johnson's ass.  well...you know what i mean.
i got a call from the f.b.i.  the daughter of the chinese ambassador has been kidnapped and they asked for help. you're it.
feds asked for me?
they asked for the best street man i had.
and that, of course, would be me.
don't push it. you better watch your ass with these fed types. if there's a screw-up, they won't think twice about burnin' it.
hey, baby, it's cool.  captain just reassigned me to the feds.
the feds?!
fbi needs a taste of the street. and i'm it.
way he put it, i was the only one he thought could handle it. but you know what the worst thing is?
no...what?
i could get promoted right out of here.
what's wrong with that?
i wouldn't be close to you.  what is that perfume, girl?
ooo, there's a chill.  love that.
carter.
any demands yet?
at this point we don't have much.
how much they want?
you come highly recommended, carter. and your particular assignment requires a special talent.
interrogation is one a my specialties, but undercover work is my forte.
... the director considers this top priority, considering he is a chinese national and here under difficult circumstances.  his name is lee.  and he is to be shown every courtesy. within reason.
sir, he's just gonna get in my way. if i'm gonna handle this situation...
he is the situation.
i'm talking about the girl.
don't worry about the kidnapping, carter, the f.b.i. will handle that. your assignment is lee.
what kind of assignment is that?
bottom line: i don't want some chung king cop getting his head blown off and turning this operation into a international incident.
why don't you assign one of your own men to this?
because with your special talents, i'm sure you'll do a better job.
what the hell am i supposed to do with him? take him to the zoo?
just make him think you're following leads.  interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  i don't care.  i just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  his plane lands in an hour. don't be late.
how'd what go?
with the fbi. what do you think i'm talking about?
oh, you're not gonna believe what they put me in charge of.  they sent for the ambassador's personal chinese investigator type.  he is like the baddest asian shield they got.  and i, let me repeat that, i am the man who is on the case with him.  just the two of us, alone, workin' the whole deal as a team.
they put you in charge?
in charge.  just me'n him.  no interference.  they don't even want to hear from us until we're done.  i love the f.b.i.  i love the f.b.i.
well...listen, if you need any help, you know, back up, call me, ok?
oh baby, don't worry, i'll call you. you can count on it.
ok. well...make us proud.  and be careful.
you talk very fast.
okay, i'll slow down.  so we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  how old are you?  you ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
beach boy.
you're shittin' me.  you know the beach boys?!
beach boy america.  help me rhonda, help me get her out of my --
help me rhonda.
let me give you a piece of advice: never touch another man's radio. you do it again, nobody, not rhonda, not yolanda, gonna save your ass.
hello.
han?
yes.
it's griffin.
griffin?  where are you.
you have one of these?
no.
yeah, well you're in american now. everybody's got guns.  that tricky shit with your hands is gonna get your ass shot to hell.
you speak english!
a little.
bullshit a little.  you lied to me.
i didn't say i didn't.  you assumed i didn't.
it's the same thing!
i am not responsible for your assumptions.
you're full of shit.  do you understand what i'm saying to you? full of shit?
not being able to speak is not the same as not speaking.  you seemed as if you liked to talk.  i like to let people talk who like to talk.  it makes it easier to find out how full of shit they are.
okay, fine, you're full a shit, i'm full a shit.
we are both full of shit.
yeah, that's right.  now that we understand each other... show me how you did that.
i am afraid i don't understand the importance of this information.
look, you want to work in this country, you gotta know this crap. okay?  we're gonna be in some deep shit here.  working the danger zone. and you need insurance.  cause, you know, you might be starting some riots and shit.
-- what the hell is that?
what?
that silly-ass look on your face.
i was being polite.
well don't do that.  polite don't work here.  you do that polite shit here in america, they'll sue your ass for harassment.
where were we?
witnesses.
wait. you hungry?  you gotta be hungry, you just flew in from china. and what'd they feed you, chinese food, right?  then you gotta be hungry.  hell, it doesn't matter, i'm hungry.  we'll get some food on the way to the consulate.
i thought you were taking me to the consulate.
oh yeah, but this is on the way.  and you gotta see john wayne's footprints. everybody does. it's almost like a law. you can't believe how small his feet were for a dude that big. tiny god damn feet!
come on. let's get you some dry clothes.
carter, can i have a moment?
what do you mean you lost him?! how could you lose him?!
try a bus load of - no, make that two bus loads of chinese --
you understand what i'm sayin'?
carter, shut up!
hello.
ambassador han.
yes.
even if you deny the fbi is there, i will assume you are lying.
my daughter.
she's fine.
can i speak with her?
you're a regular god damn acrobat, aren't you?  bet you feel real good makin' me look like an asshole.
it was not my intent --
right....
mr. carter, i appreciate your desire to show me a good time, but that is not the reason i am here.
let me just clarify a few things.  i don't care what kind of cop you are in china, you have no jurisdiction in america.  without me you are just another tourist.
what about them?
i know a shortcut.
shortcut?
you don't know what a shortcut is?
well.. i wouldn't want to be in the way.
no way in the way!  i'm talkin' back up, johnson. i'm in charge! and i need you, baby.
he stole my wheel!
this is pathetic.
i'm gonna arrest the sonuvabitch!  your ass is goin' to jail!
you make the plate?
what plate?
the license!  you get it?!
no.
what the hell kinda cop are you?!
did you make the plate?!
it was my ass that almost got trashed!
he was trying to kill me, not you.
yeah, sure, you got lots a enemies in l.a. after what?  six hours?
it was a man i was after in hong kong.
bullshit!  you were trying' to lose my ass again.
when a man steps in dung, it is obvious.  there is no need to rub it in his face.  the smell is the same.
what is that, some kind of chinese proverb?
no. i just made it up.
yo, johnson...
you think this is funny, carter?  you send for someone from explosives!? four men just died in there!
hey, man, you can use her. she's an expert!
that's what you were supposed to be!
you know what a phone booth is?!
the bomb was meant as a demonstration of our sincerity.  if you want the ambassador's daughter back alive, listen and do not talk.
lee!  it's him!
the first drop will be made tomorrow. at twelve o'clock.  the amount will be fifty million.
fifty million!  are we talkin' united states dollars?
in used currency.  nothing bigger than a fifty.
that's some serious poundage in dollars.
what is your name?
that's cool.  we're gettin' to know each other. this is a good thing. i'm carter.
carter.  i just want to be able to tell the ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
hey, that's whacked!  i thought we was gettin' on here!
shut up!
ok. say what it is.
the ambassador will receive instructions for the drop, half an hour before it is to be made.  if it is successful, there will be more. thank you, agent carter.
hmmmm?
don't play bullshit games with me.
eleven thirty tomorrow the ambassador will receive a phone call telling him where the drop is.  he said the bomb was a demonstration of their sincerity.
oh yeah.  the caller was a man. confident.  had an accent.  my guess, asian.  anything else i can do for the fbi, sir?
why don't you try the assignment.  or should i call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
no, sir. i'm as good as it gets.
i worked with ambassador han and his family for ten years.  he wanted me to come with them to america.  if i had, this might not have happened.
don't go there...
i could not come.  i had other responsibilities.
hey, stop.  we're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' beach boy songs again. then i'll really get depressed.
i also did not come because i think i would not fit in america.
hey, everybody fits in here. look at l.a., man.  nobody's from here.  my momma's from detroit, my dad's from atlanta, they met in texas, got married in vegas and i was born in alabama.  so where the hell am i from? kenya?
alright, listen, no bullshit just tell me straight: did you really know the guy you were chasin'?
yes. he was part of the juntao crime family. he may be juntao himself.  and he dropped this.
when we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  this is my man, you dig?  my informant. you know what an informant is?
stooly.
what?
stool pigeon.
yeah, somethin' like that.  ok, now this is a nasty ass place. when you go into a place like this, the most important thing is control. you got to maintain control. you following me? you lose it, you get hurt. now, you're my responsibility and i don't want you hurt. you understand?  ok, let's go.
you talk too fast.
come on!
let's go.  everybody take off?
took off. yes. they took off.
you see what i'm sayin'? you control the space.
thank you. i learn a great deal.
it happens.
you got a boy friend in here yet? Œcause you're gonna need somebody to kiss your ass goodbye.
what are you talking about?
you're movin' to death row. see, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of four fbi agents. and when i turn this into the lab, they're gonna find lafontaine all over it. and we already know...  ...this is your mo.
how did i do this?! maybe you didn't notice but i'm in jail!
all i gotta do is implicate.  the feds can do a lot with a good implication. even if you don't get sparky, i'll bet you get ten to twenty more. plenty of time to find a nice fella.
you sonuvabitch.
i'm waitin' here for a name.
where do we find him?
you don't. he finds you. through his people.
i am so sorry about your men.
yes sir, me too. the state department has authorized release of the funds. we'll have to make the first drop at 7.  as soon as they pick up the money, we've got Œem.
and mr. lee?  where is he?
don't worry, he's with carter.
let's get us a photo and description. we'll have an apb out while we stake out the restaurant.
that is a problem. there is no description of juntao. no known photograph.
are you tellin' me nobody knows what he looks like?  come on, there must be witnesses somewhere.
juntao's standing orders were to kill everyone. there were never witnesses.
you like it?
yeah, it's good.
that one is my favorite.  chicken puff with shark fin.
you want more?
no, no.  i'm full. too much fin and hump, you know, gives me gas.  Œscuse me.
now, that's american music.
yes, i know this song.
you know war?
who does not know war?  ³war, hhh, wo-ooh-wo-ooh-wo-oh.  what is it good for?  absolutely nothing. good-god, you all.²
that's not how it goes.
yes, i think so.
no, no.  it's not good-god you all! it's good-god, ya'll.  ya'll!
yee-aww.
not yee-aw, ya'll.  and it's gotta be angry.  like you're pissed off.
good god, ya'll!
no! you hate me.  look, i'm gonna do it one time.  that's it.
are you ok?
i got to stop that dancing in the street Œtill all hours.
want some?
no, fish is a pm food.
excuse me?
nobody in america eats fish in the am. we're talking strictly an after twelve noon food type.
what?!
it's him.
which one?
going into the restaurant.
this is my territory now.  you are my responsibility.
this concrete?  this is still america.
what do you hear?
ok, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
i am from outa town.
no, like a tourist.  you know, things to see, money to burn, interested in stupid shit.
like that.
i am sorry, but i have too much respect for women.
no, please, i don't --
it ain't your ass, it's my ass you're backin' up.  take the damn gun.
yes.
you have what i asked for?
i do.
pack it into black garbage bags. throw the bags into a garbage dump in the alley behind the fang shan restaurant in china town.  you have twenty-nine minutes left.
no, wait.  i don't have it.  you have it.
oh yes.
oh no, i dropped it.
you drop my gun and you lose my i.d.?
i'm sorry.
okay, let me start from the top.  a few days ago i was on this munitions dealer named lafontaine. now, after the shit blew up last night...
i'm not interested, carter.  you're no longer on this assignment.
what?!
and your buddy, mr. lee, is on his way back to china.  now, get out. before i file obstruction of justice charges against you.
yes.
you have run out of time.  the amount now is two hundred million.  i will call later with instructions.  you will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
please, you must understand, what happened today was not --
i'm sorry, lee.
be sorry for soon young. she has no chance now.
you got a lot of guts calling me.
yes i do. that's all i got. guts and you, johnson. there's no one else i can trust.
you made a fool out of me! in front of the fbi!
listen, this ain't about us! it's about a thirteen year old girl. she's not gonna make it. unless we do something.
jesus...what do you want?
this whole thing is goin' down tonight. i need to know where the ambassador is gonna be. the feds will be keepin' a lid on everything. you thing you can do that?
this is my city. i'm a cop. i'll find Œem.
alright, johnson, thank you.  so...what are you wearing?
what are you doing here?
well, i ain't goin' to china.  and neither are you.
hello.
take the money with you tonight. pack it in six dragons. you will be contacted again.
i want to speak with my daughter!
oh my god...what happened to you?
it's called a dress.
it's called you're gonna kill me. what're you doin' with that on?
wait a minute. i'm not riding in that.
what?! this is a class ride, johnson.
yeah, if you're superfly.
that's it! you can attack me, but when you attack my car, i cannot forgive! you in the back, girl!
oh no.
what?
the art.
you don't like it?
it's okay. for restaurants.
no, it is china, my country, my history.  if any of it gets damaged...
hey, don't worry.  nothing's gonna happen to it.
oh my god. griffin.
you know him?
he'll be ok. russ is a tough son of a bitch.
tell me about it.
he was just doing his job.
so was i.
you ok?
we saved the girl and got the bad guys, didn't we?
yeah. so why you look do down?
look at me! my dress is ruined. i look like shit.
not to me. never to me.
how about a lift home?
absolutely. i'll even let you ride in the front seat.
what a surprise!
fbi calls up my ass, says they need help in tokyo.  like i'm supposed to drop everything.
it's hong kong, not tokyo.  my country asked for the best.  i told them that was you.  now i will show you around my Œhood.
no shark fin, no camel hump.  what you listenin' to?
oh, i think you like this very much.
