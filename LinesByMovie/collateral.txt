...why is everything always about you...
...everything is not about me, do not make me the villain here.  that asshole was out of line, and you goddamn well know it...
...i'm sorry, i do not see it that way...
...oh, bullshit!  he was intruding on my space, he was demeaning me personally, he was patronizing...
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  i have to work with him...
...well, last i checked, you were sleeping with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I would suggest an attitude shift...
hi ya' doin'?  where to?
park avenue and east 2nd. take centre to canal, up the bowery, cooper and third, left on 41st, come around on park.
I will take sixth.  it is faster.
what?
sixth is faster.
sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
the bowery, you gotta deal with runoff from two bridges.
sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at herald square. look, i make this trip all the time.
first friday of the month?  linens. roll right off the trucks.  they are in and out in twenty minutes...  ...which means they left fifteen minutes ago.  traffic will be smooth.
but bowery's fine, if that is what you want.
we taking bets?  what if you are wrong?
the ride is free.
you got a deal.
go ahead, say it.
no.  i got lucky with the lights.
no.  you were right, i was wrong...  ...max.
you like bach?
i used to play this piece back in high school.
let me guess.  clarinet?
violin.  i never had the lungs for wind instruments.
could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
different instrument altogether.  you know, if you would only listened to me, we would be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
keep it.  go wild.  have a party.
why did you do that?  do not tell me you are a gentleman, max. i thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
it is no big deal.
no?  how many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
there were two of us.  i had the other guy killed.  do not need the competition...
you are an anomaly in today's world, max.  you are good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
this?  temporary.  to pay the bills and save. i got plans...
like what?
travel...and things.
you like being a lawyer?
you psychic?
sure.  I am starting an 800 hotline.  caught part of your phone call.  and even if i hadn't, there is the dark pinstripe, armani, elegant, not too hip, which rules out advertising, plus a top-of-the-line briefcase that you live out of, looks like bottega...
bottega.
...bottega.  guy gets in my cab wearing a catcher's mask, i think he is a ballplayer.  you?  definitely clarence darrow.
not quite.  he did defense.  I am a prosecutor...
big case?
yeah.
you never answered my question.  you like what you do?
most of the time.
but not now?
like you, I am good at it.  but at this exact moment in time...like i got to sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
you need a vacation.
just had one.
not in a cab...  i mean a disconnection...get your head straight...you know, get it together...
when was the last time you took one?
soon.  but i take little ones all the time.  comoros islands in the indian ocean.
how often you go?
dozen times a day.
no, no way, i could not take that...
yes, you could.  i think you need it more than i do.  it will help.  i promise.
thanks for everything, max.  wow...
sure thing.
hello?
oh.  sorry.
uh, let's go to...  hello...?
yeah, yeah, sorry...
how long you think this'll take?
twenty-four minutes.
twenty-four?  not twenty-five?  or twenty-three?
two minutes to get on broadway. they are doing some roadwork around the bridge.  eleven to get downtown.  four to the lower east side.  six to clear the roadwork.  one minute margin for error.  my math says twenty-four.
mind if i time you?  what do i get if you are wrong?  a free ride?
an apology.
first time in new york?
third, but i still can not tell uptown from downtown.  tell the truth, whenever I am here, i can not wait to leave.  place gets to me.  too loud, too fast...too much.  you like it here?
it is home.
you share it with over three million people every day.  you know that is the population of new zealand?  what is manhattan, thirteen miles long? that is a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  read about this one guy.  gets on the subway and dies.  six hours he is riding around before anybody notices. think about that.  here's this corpse doing laps around manhattan courtesy of the new york transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. three million.  that is too damn many people.
i see your point.
you know, this is the cleanest cab I have ever been in.  this your regular ride?
yeah.  i share it with the dayshift guy.
you prefer nights?
people are more relaxed.  less stress, less traffic, better tips.
you on some kind of work plan?
you mean like benefits?
yeah.  retirement?  paid sick leave?
it is not that kind of job.
you should start a union.
me, specifically?
why not?
last thing i need is a reason to keep hacking.  this job's a fill-in.
oh?  how long you been doing this?
twelve years.  but I am working on other stuff...
like what?
i do not talk about it, you know...  no offense.
none taken.  there are talkers and doers.  i like doers.
twenty-four minutes!  man, you are hot...
yeah.  lucky with the lights.
bullshit.  you probably know the light schedules, too.  listen, I am in town tonight on a closing.  five stops, one night.  i got to catch a six a.m. flight.  i got five stops to make, see some friends, collect some signatures.  why do not you hang with me?
I am not a hire car.  it is against regs?
regulations?  these guys do not even give you sick leave.  how much you pull down on a good night?
two, two-fifty.
I will make it an even five hundred. plus an extra hundred if you get me to lax on time.
we have a deal.  what is your name?
max.
max?  I am vincent.
he fell on my cab!  from up th-th-there.
you always stutter?
yeah, yeah.  shit, man.  guy fell on my motherfucking cab.
i think he is dead.
no shit.  since he has two .45s double- tapped through the sternum and fell six floors onto his head...
you - you killed him?
no-no, i-i shot him.  the bullets and the fall killed him.
you cool, max?  say "i'm cool."
you are cool.
no.  you say you are cool.
I am cool.
good.  help me out here.
with what?
you were going to drive me around. drop me at lax.  never be the wiser. but el gordo missed the elevator.  so we go to plan b.  pop the trunk.
the trunk?
did i stutter?  the trunk.  unless you want him riding up front with you...but given hygiene and his sphincters have let go...
I am going to roll him off the hood. always lift with your legs...
i do not think i can do this.
it is just a dead guy.  on three, ready?  uno.  dos.  three.
got it?
yeah.
what?
his hand moved!  his goddamn hand twitched!
it is a spasm!  jesus, max, do not be such a girl...
uh, look...why do not you just take the car...
...and you promise you will never tell anybody about this, right?  get in the fucking car.
max.  may we leave the scene of the crime now, please.
I am trying...
max.
it is not me.
you listening to me?
yes!  I am trying, i swear!
try harder.  I am going to count to three. one...
two...
it is not me, it is the engine!  a fat guy fell on it from six floors up!
what about that?
i tried it.
how about the thingy next to it?
the thingy next to it has nothing to do with the starter motor...
I am making you nervous.  I am the one with a schedule.
okay, try it now.
try some deep breathing.
what?
adrenaline's wearing off.  you get shaky after.  it is not uncommon.  deep breathing helps.
you better?
i think so.
what are you doing?
it is a mess.
so?
58th and central.  you know it?
south central.
how long, you figure?
oh.  oh, no.  you are kidding.  we...
i told you we had other stops to make tonight.
you said you were visiting friends!
they are somebody's friends...  you drive a cab.  i kill people.  we both do our jobs right, you might survive the night and come out four hundred bucks ahead.
listen.  I am not trying to piss you off, see?  okay?  i can not drive you around so you can murder folks.
tonight it is.
you do not understand.  i mean it. really.  I am not up for this...
are you breathing?
yes.
what else calms you down?  candy? cigarettes?  sex?  breathe.
music.
play music.
chopin prelude.  stodgy, but nice.  here's the deal.  i did not want you involved in this.  still breathing? but now that you are, we have to make the best of it, max.  improvise.  life is that way.  adapt to your environment.  survive.  darwin.  "shit happens."  the i ching.  whatever. roll with it.
i ching?  you threw a man out a window!
i did not throw him, he fell.
what did he do to you?
nothing.  i only met him the one time.
how can you kill him like that?
i should only kill people after i get to know 'em?  six billion people on the planet, you are getting bent out of shape 'cause of one fat guy?
who was he?
what do you care?  ever hear of rwanda?
rwanda-burundi.  central africa.
tens of thousands killed before sundown.  nobody's killed that fast since hiroshima and nagasaki.  did you bat an eye, max?  join amnesty international?  no.  i off one angeleno, you throw a hissy fit...
i do not know any rwandans.
you do not know the guy in the trunk, either.  if it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a continuing criminal enterprise.
oh, it is okay, then.  'cause you are just taking out the garbage...
yeah, like that...  but, anyway, nobody gets out of this alive.  even if we quit smoking and cut out red meat.  everybody dies.
get rid of 'em.
how?
you are a cabby.  like talk yourself out of a ticket?
please.  do not do anything.
then do not let me get cornered, max. you do not have the trunk space.
i can not believe this.
believe it.
I will talk to them, I will talk to them.
good luck.  you think they got families?
that one's probably married.  think of his kids.  his wife's pregnant...
I will deal with it.  i will, i will...
this your current address?
yes.
a deer?
comin' over coldwater.  goddamn deer jumps out in front of me.  you believe that?
you still carrying passengers?
i was heading back to my garage.  it is on the way.
this vehicle's not safe to drive. we are going to have to impound it.  get you towed.  step away from the vehicle and pop the trunk.  I am sorry, sir, you will have to find another cab.
come on, it is been a long, shitty day. how about a break?  I will call a tow truck myself, i swear.  i will not budge from this spot.
save me the grief.  step out of the car, sir, and open the trunk.
hands on the wheel.  ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
why?
because i have a gun and i say so.
who is that?
lenny, my dispatcher.
i know you are out there!  answer the goddamn call!
what happens if you don't?
he will keep calling.
max!  dammit!  answer!
uh, yeah?  lenny?  it is me.
i just got off the phone with the cops.  they called to check you brought the cab in...
yeah?  so?
so? aside from i hate talking to cops, they tell me you crashed the shit out of it.
it got crashed!  i didn't...
i give a shit whose fault it was, you are payin'!
it was an accident.  you are not liable.  tell him.
it was an accident.  I am not liable.
do not take that.  tell him to shut the fuck up.
i can not do that.  he is the man.  he will fire my ass.
so what?
i need the job.
no you don't.
he is not paying you one cent!
who the hell is this?
vincent farrell, assistant u.s. attorney.  a passenger in this taxicab, and I am reporting you to the dmv...
let's not get excited, sir.
how am i supposed to not get excited, listening to you trying to extort your employee, you sarcastic prick?
i was just tryin' to...to...
tell it to max.  tell him he is an asshole.
lenny?  you are an asshole.
tell him next time he pulls any shit, you are going to kick his fat ass.
next time you pull any shit, I am going to kick your fat ass.
oh.  oh, thank god, hey!  hey, guys, hey, help me out here!
yo, whassup?
i got my, my hands taped to the steering wheel here, there is this guy, he taped me in the car, he is back there somewhere.
you are kidding me.
I will fuck you up, you do not hand it over.
my hands are taped to the fucking  steering wheel!
...oh god, do not shoot me...
...show me the wallet, man, get your ass up, up...
i had no idea these cabs came equipped with emergency strobes.  where is the button?  under the dash?
yeah.
another collateral.
what?
collateral damage.
i do not understand...
people in the wrong place at the wrong time.  draws attention, which is something you avoid in my line of work.  and for you? you attract attention, you are going to get people killed who do not need to be.
vincent?
yes, max?
am i collateral?
but, hey, some good news.  this last one put me way ahead of schedule. we have actually got some time to kill.  jazz?  you like jazz?
i'm...what?  sorry?
jazz.  music.
i listen to classical.
friend of mine told me about this great place in south central.  says it is like the birthplace of west coast bebop.  bird.  dexter gordon. thelonious monk.  chet baker.  I will buy you a drink.  expand your horizons...
...this snitch of yours, what is his name, ivan?
ivan petrov.  supposed to meet me for dinner, never shows up.  i come here, find this.
you guys been holding hands?
months now.  he is been feeding me information on dmitri.
dmitri gusunov? what the fuck, why? forget about dimitri, feds are all over him.  they are a heartbeat away from taking him down.  word's gone out, they do not want us anywhere near him...
oh, we working for the feds now?  if my snitch flew out a window, he is got dmitri's handprints on his ass. that makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
what homicide?  phil.  where is a body? look.  all we got is glass...
there was a car here, you can see where the glass came down all around it.  ivan flew out the window and went bam.
he could'a been depressed.  it still does not tell me homicide.
remember that thing a few years back? that thing with the cab?
what thing?
cabbie drove around all night.  three people got killed.
oh, right.  the guy flipped out or something?  killed some people, then put a gun to his own head?
they found him dead in his own cab down by the port authority.
so?  it was a random thing.
i never bought that.
oh?
cabbie had no criminal record, no history of mental illness.  suddenly, he just wigs out and pops three people, then himself?  plus the victims were not random solid citizens. they were all lowlives.  wiseguys.  I have always wondered if there was someone else in the cab.
...see now, this has got a little post- war flavor, a little miles thing happening.  awesome.  what do you think?
i never learned jazz.
god, are you always this prosaic?  you do not learn jazz, it is not something you are taught. it is like breathing, like life.  like us, tonight, taking what comes and going with the flow.
that what we are doing?  flowing?
damn right.  instinct, man.  if you think too much, it does not work.  just listen...
I am not catching a melody.
that is the point.  you play between the notes, you dance around the structure, you improvise.  some people know where they are going to be ten years from now.  same job, same neighbors, same shit over and over.  that is not living.  that is dying a little every day.  not me, pal.  it is not knowing what is around the corner that makes like worth living.  that is jazz.  that guy up there, he knows what I am talking about.  hell, it is the same thing he's talking about, if you just open your ears.  you can hear it in the conversation he is having with that trumpet...
...i was just a young cat back then, about nineteen, bussin' tables in this very place.  did not pay but shit, but that was not the point.  being around the music, that was the thing.  and i was.  take this one night...july 22, 1964...who walks in?  mr. louis armstrong.
you are kidding me.
right through those doors.  the man himself.
jesus...
he would come over from queens to do the ed sullivan show.  after, he decides to come on up to harlem and hang with the common folk.  that is how he was, you see.  never forgot where he came from.  money and fame an' all that?  meant nothin', long as he could blow that horn.  so before you it, he is up on that stage, doin' his thing.
was it great?  better than great, it had to be...
like winton marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  louis was playing.  god was smiling.
you heard armstrong play live.  I have never been this jealous.  you get to talk to him?
did better'n that.
no.
oh, my, yes.
get outta here!  you and louis?
fella owned this place back then, dix dwyer, he let slip to louis that i played.  so pops, he just waves me right up.  my heart about stopped. but i got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
unbelievable...  ...you hearing this?  unbelievable.
remember what you played?
most vividly.  "st. louis blues," "potato head blues," "sleepy time down south..."  ...then pops laid some "cornet chop suey" on me, and left me in the dust like a whipped dog.
the crowd had to dig it.
the crowd was most kind.  i was born in 1945, but my life began the night of july 22, 1964.  that was the moment of my conception.  right here in this very room.
you know dmitri?
'fraid so.
and here i was thinking you were such a nice guy.
i am a nice guy, daniel.  with a job to do.  you know how it is.
let him go, vincent.
you mind?  I am working here.
you are the one who keeps talking about going with the flow.  you like the man, you like the way he plays.  how about a little jazz, huh?
jazz?  that is funny, coming from you.  okay, some jazz for the jazz man. how is this?  I will ask a question.
what kind of question?
jazz question.  what other kind is there?  you get it right, we roll with it.  you disappear.  tonight.  you do not go home, you do not pack a bag, you just leave town...and nobody, i mean nobody, ever hears from you or sees you again.
how do i know you will keep your word?
i never lie.  ask max.  max, have i lied yet?
one more thing.  if by some chance i get this wrong...tell dmitri I am sorry.
of course.
lay it on me.
it is simple.  what was your pal louis' first musical instrument?
i know the answer.  i know all there is to know about louis.
then let's have it.
let's go.
no.
what you mean, no?
I am done.  find another cab.
max?  what are you doing?
leave me alone.
do not even think you are walking away from me.
i do not wanna know you!
pull your head out of your ass.  get your thinking straight.  you wanna die?
I am collateral anyway, so just fucking do it and stop making me a part of this!
teach him how to talk back, suddenly he can not stop.  I am not playing.
sure?  like you did not play him? string him along?  if he had gotten the answer right, would you have let him go?
max?  maaax.  pick up, dipshit.
jesus, what is with this guy?
maaaaaax!
you hassling my driver again?
who is this?
same fare you talked to last time. the u.s. attorney...
what are you guys, taking an all-night tour?
we are gay lovers, what is it to you?
nothin'!  aside from max's mother driving me crazy, I am dancin' on a rainbow!  get him on the line, please.
hang on.  carefully...
yeah?
where you been the last two hours? your mother's been calling every ten minutes whining about how you did not show up.
show up for what?
tell her i can not see her tonight, okay?
show up for what?
she is in the hospital.
you go every night?
what difference does it make?
guy with a routine goes and breaks it? provokes attention.  that is bad.  and that is not good...
there is no way I am taking you to see my mother!
hi, ma.
I have been calling and calling.
i got caught up at work.
you could not pick up a phone?  I am lying here, wondering if something horrible happened...
i brought you flowers.
what am i gonna do with flowers?
you are going to cheer up.
by worrying about you spending money on foolish things?  so i can watch them wilt?
he paid for 'em.
why did not you tell me we had company?  and what is your name?
no harm done, ma'am.
you paid for my flowers?  they are beautiful.  max, you going to introduce us?
mom, vincent.  vincent, my mother, ida rilke.
happy to meet you, mrs. rilke.
oh, call me ida.  to what do we owe the pleasure?
i was with max when he got the call.
and you came all the way down here to see me?
it is nothing.
tell my son.  you have to hold a gun to his head to get him to come see me.
tell me about it.
client?  i like to think of myself as more of a friend.  a mentor.
max never had many friends.  so much with the piano.  always keeping to himself, it is unhealthy...
i'm...in...the...room, here.  do not talk about me like I am not in the room.
what is he sayin'?
I am standing right here.
yesss, you are.  he is artistic.
I am sure you are very proud of max.
of course I am proud.  you know he started with nothing?  look at him today.  playing concerts.
mom, vincent's not interested.
oh, I am captivated.
quite an achievement...
what is your name?
vincent...
i came to see you, you look fine.  we gotta go.
vincent.  it was nice to meet you. visit again?
I am in town for a short time.
try?
of course!
you take one more step, I will kill her.
you would do her a favor.
what the fuck was that?
jazz.
...yeah, I am still at bellevue.  the john doe did not pan out, but you will never guess who is lying up in the meat locker.
elvis?
joey cicerno.  dear friend and associate of my missing snitch, ivan petrov.  both of whom were in bed with dmitri.
jesus.  two in one night?
something big's going down, and I am betting the feds do not know about it. you got to get us in there.
pick me up in five minutes.
limos, huh?
do not start.
hey, I am not the one who is been lying to my mother.
she hears what she wants to hear, okay?
maybe so.  maybe she hears what you tell her.
fuck!  nothing's ever goddamn good enough!  it is always been that way.
it is cause they do not like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  i had a father like that.
yeah?  what happened?
he hated everything i did.  hated me. got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
what happened?
i killed him.  when i was 15.  he was my first.  nah, wishful thinking.  liver cancer.
I am sorry.
do not be.  i never saw him after i was 15.  went into the military early.  so all this talk about "my job's temporary, i got big plans," it is all bullshit.
it is not bullshit.
what do you call it?  ten years does not sound temporary to me.  i should have known it was bullshit, you are too good at what you do.
I have always been good.  ever since i started.  gave up piano.  easy money. I am putting a stake together, get something started.  go figure it all out...
yeah?  like what?  limos?
i told you i do not like to talk about it.
well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  when you leaving?
see, I have got bills.  my mother's been dying of the same disease since i was a kid.
what, no insurance?
does not cover everything.
good excuse.  how many others you got?
gimme your wallet.
why?
I will just hold onto it for you.  in case they check.
in case who checks?
our friends in little russia.  go in and ask for a man named dmitri.
dmitri?
the man who hired me for this contract.
i do not get it.
you are going to be me.  you are going to go in, and you are going to get the info on the remaining two hits.
why me?  why do not you do it?
no client has ever seen my face, and i intend to keep it that way.  besides, if he decides to put a bullet in my head, i do not wanna be there for it.
he is going to shoot me?
when he finds out you tossed his list? i would.
no.  no way.  i can not do this.
max.  you threw my briefcase in the river.  you have got balls bigger than toledo.
i...i was not thinking.  i just did it.
that is jazz, my friend.  you said it yourself.  so do not tell me you do not know how to play between the notes.
vincent.  do not make me do this. do not make me get people killed.
we have both run out of options.  if it helps, take comfort in knowing you never had a choice.
how long have you been a hit man?
why?
in case he asks.
fifteen years, although i prefer the term "assassin."
you get benefits?
no.
paid sick leave?
you tell me to start a union, I am blowing your head off.  quit stalling and get out of the cab.
captain walt muldoon, nypd.
detective sergeant phil heller.
something going on?
pretty quiet down there.  a cab just pulled up, aside from that...
i see.  that was an important list, would not you say?  the people on that list are being subpoenaed tomorrow by a federal judge.  and you "lost" it?
I am sorry.
sorry?
tell me, vincent.  do you believe in santa claus?
can not say that i do.
neither do i.  but my children, they are still young.  do you know who they like even more than jolly old saint nicholas?  his helper, black peter. an old russian fairy tale tells of how santa got so busy looking after all the good kids, he had to hire a helper to punish all the bad kids.  that was black peter's job.  he was given the list of all the bad children, and he would visit them in their homes late at night.  and if he caught them not saying their prayers, he would leave a bundle of wooden switches outside their door.  that was a warning.  if they continued to misbehave, he would swoop down and take the children away. and they would never be seen again.
tell me vincent.  tell me what you think.
i think...
what?
i think...  ...i think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
what?  what did you say?
i said.  get the gun.  out.  of my fucking face. before i wrap it in a blintz and feed it to you.
i picked up a tail.
federal?
you tell me.  i had to toss the list in the river.  i was protecting your sorry, long-winded ass.  so why do not you show a little courtesy?
you think i wanted to come here tonight?  you think I am that stupid? sometimes shit happens, you got to roll with it.
tell me.  has black peter already crossed off a few bad children?
the fat man on cherry street.  the other fat man, mr. bulldozer.  the trumpet player.  that leaves two.
can you finish on schedule?
in fifteen years, i have never left a customer unsatisfied.
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
...petrov and cicerno for sure...
vincent.  do not cross me.
would not dream of it.
as a token of my appreciation for your understanding in this matter, I would like to offer you a discount for my services tonight.  twenty five percent.
twenty five?
hell, make it fifty.  same goes for any business we have in the future.
very generous.
by the way.  daniel said he was sorry.
advance team, two men, stick to that goddamn cab, stay in radio contact, the rest of us follow in the van. nobody moves until the entire team's in place...
can you fax me his picture?  his license or something?  what do you mean you do not have that there?  anybody else in the cab?
damn, max.  I am impressed.  really.  i would have bet good money you would not walk out of there.
makes two of us.
washington and holt.  dance club called "fever." know it?
tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  twelve minutes.
you do impress me, max.  that you do.
...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  what an asshole. cabbie's name is max rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...
so?
...so, his description of max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of villa rodeo.  that guy?  that guy is a cabbie.  and you are telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? what is he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
no.  your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.
lemme tell you something.  vincent and a few other guys like him are fucking ghosts.  nobody even know what he looked like until now...
i do not know...
what are you gonna do?
take him down.  save richard yip, our witness...
what if they are wrong?
not our call, phil.
...if they are wrong?!
this is not our goddamn game!
would you have called her?
who?
your lady friend.  the one who gave you her business card.  think she was just being polite?
i do not know.
what holds you back, max?  tell me. why does life scare you so much?
i only owe you a ride, vincent.
it is not what you owe me. time is so fleeting.  one day it is gone.  you make it out of this alive, max, you really should call her.  that is what i think.
good.  blood, urine and death get to you? try deep breathing.  or remember we all die anyway...
you had to kill heller?!
who is heller?
that cop!  why did you have to do that?  you could not wound him?  the guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who got to grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
i shoulda saved him 'cause he believed you?
no, not just that.
yeah, that.
yeah, so, what is wrong with that?
it is what i do for a living.
some living.
head towards union station.
what is at union station?
how are you at math?  i was hired for five hits.  i did four.
one more.
there you go...!
whyn't you kill me and find another cab.
you are too good.  we are in this together.  fates intertwined.  cosmic coincidence and all that crap...
you are full of shit.
i'm full of shit?  you are a monument of bullshit.  you even bullshitted yourself all i am, is taking out the garbage.  bad guys killing bad guys...
that is what you said...
and you believe me...?
what did they do?
how do i know?  but, they all got that "witnesses for the prosecution" look to me.  probably some major federal indictment against somebody who majorly does not want to get indicted...  i dunno.
that is the reason?
that is the "why."  that is the why? there is no reason.  no good reason; no bad reason.  to live or to die.
then what are you?
...indifferent.
get with it.  get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  lost in space.  the universe does not care.  the cop, you, me?  who notices?
what happened to you?
as in...?
man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "you got to tell me what is goin' on with that person over there or I will kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'cause you do not have a clue for...or about...anyone...  to be like that, i do not think you, you have any of that for your own life...  do you believe you are entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  open your eyes in the morning?  i do not think you do...i do not think so...  i think you are way low...like in your estimation.  in your estimation of yourself.  so how did you get that way...?
...all the cabbies in la, i pull max, the man with x-ray vision...
answer the question.
look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the comoros.  how much you got saved?
none of your business.
...pie in the sky?  "someday my dream'll come..."  but one night you will wake up and realize suddenly you are old.  it has not happened.  it never will.  life just flipped on you.  tomorrow became yesterday.  then you will bullshit yourself it was never going to happen, anyway, and push it back in memory...and anesthetize yourself in a barcalounger with daytime tv for the rest of your life...  do not talk to me about murder.  you are do-in' yourself...in this yellow prison with steel-belted radials. clocking in and out everyday...
'cause i never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
slow down.
i should have done that.  fixed it and more.  get out from under what i been under...
you are going too fast.
but you know what?  nothing matters, anyway.  we are insignificant out here in the big nowhere, say the badass sociopath in my backseat.  right? yeah.  that is one thing I have got to thank you for, bro.  and i never saw it that way...
slow the hell down!
what are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  kill us?  go ahead, man! shoot...my ass.
slow down!
vincent?
well.  that was brilliant.
was your seatbelt fastened, honey?
you dizzy?  you want to sit down?
i'm...fine.  fine.
you sure?  you look pretty shaky...
annie...it's max.
max...
max, the cab driver!
max?  oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
listen to me!  just listen, okay? there is a man, vincent, he is coming to kill you!
he's...what?  say again?  we are in cell hell...
kill you!  he is coming to kill you!
if this is a joke, it is not funny.
dmitri hired him!  he is already killed all your witnesses, now he is coming after you!  he was stalking you when i dropped you off.  i do not know what happened, but he diverted and got into my cab, instead.
did you say dmitri? how do you know about my case?  i do not understand...
it does not matter!  just get out of the goddamn building...
...okay, max, i believe you...i'll get out of the building...
no, no, wait...
...he's two floors below you.
in my office?
where are you, what floor?
seventh, files section.  what should i do?
he does not know you are up there!  just stay right where you are!  call the police!
max, I am scared.  are you sure?
yes!  stay put, goddamn it!  do not move from that spot...
max?
let her go.
