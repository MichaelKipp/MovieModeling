yeah. what did you do? you explain it. ...why I am not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. explain that!
i do not know what you are talking about.
the nicholson node. i suppose you have not heard of that either.

i know...it sounds insane.
you said it.
what are you doing?
loading a gun.

no they won't.
why not?
I will talk to them.
oh...gooood!
I will tell you what to say.
if i get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
if I am real, they will get me out. if I am not, they will treat you. either way you will be better off than you are now. you will get a reward.
anyone there?
no one. maybe i dreamed it all up.
behind us?
still clear. just a motorcycle.
what is that?
nothing. just the cyclist. he is passed us.
what did he look like?
he is not the problem. it is the van in the back.
what do i do?
outrun them.
this is a fiesta!

whatever you do, just...don't stop.
i would not say that.
then what are you stopping for?
get your breathing down. you sound like a cement mixer.
can not see a goddamn thi..
i want out.
too late...they want you.
why? al  you know too much.
i do not know anything. i just want to go home.
you have no choice, you are involved. will you help?
calm down! act rational.
how do you act when someone trys to kill you?
now, joe, you know it was all a mistake, do not you?
no, it wasn't, it was intentional.
why would we want to hurt you?
not you. them.
who?
i do not know who.
i do not know...to get al.
no. do not tell the guards.
al?
the little man in my...  ...head...
must be delayed effects of the drug... I will get him out of here.
he work for us?
ah...no sir. he was here for a job interview.
what job?
does not matter. then put him away.
sir?
private clinic. best of care. total privacy. we will pay all costs.
bit expensive, sir.
it is the least we can do. after all, it is our responsibility.
did you hear that?
yeah.  al wants to talk to you!
what did he say, how is he know about al?
what does he know?
too much.
look, nobody knows we did it.
whoever took it does.
it'l take months.
so we better get started.
what about al...
it can not take that long.
why?
joe or what?
i do not know. i do not want to find out.
they could put you back in the tube..
I would be helpless and useless. they do not have the pem. without that...there's no chance.
well...they sure as hell are not going to get it for you.
they are busy covering their asses. they are not the type of people we need."
yeah...who is?
i am. you are.
you are crazy!
you are the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...we'll have to do it on our own.
what do you mean we.
you gotta help.
i did. i brought you back here.
we are a team...my...talent. your... mobility.
thanks.
think of the scientific data we will gain. come on, lets get out of here.
I am not leaving until you do.
I am not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
of course you are not. we will take good care of you.
ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
find you?
I am not going to make it easy.
they will have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
why do not you just get out, leave me alone.
ahhh...nothing.
been complaning of hallucinations.
not...complaining, actually.
been hearing voices.
was quite excited, when he came in...
much better now, thank you. just sit here quietly...see there is nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
sue them.
I will sue.
sue who?
you...him...ust.
i do not like the sound of that.
we have to get out of here.
door's locked.
see the codelock? punch this in. 26993
now what.
go out, take your first left.
just walk down the hall?
with authority!
which way do i go?
what does it say.
corridor a.
take a left and your next right.
where are we going?
a lab and equipment.
is it familiar? have you been here before.
i was thirsty. he told me to get a drink.
who did?
the man.
oh my god...what did he look like, the man?
i can not remember..
like the guys that attacked us.
what do you mean?
black suits and helmets.
that is it. they know I am in here. we have got to find them.
that is not a good idea.
they think we are safe here. they do not really need us. they are probably long gone.
gone where?
do not know.
you need id in there?
you do. to get out of here. you are going to be me.
i do not wanna be you. i wanna go home.
you can not go home. when ust finds we are gone, they will come after you and put us away.
anything...a feeling...a smell..?
nothing!
wait a minute. the fight. where did he get you?
just scratched my arm, why?
I will be out of touch for a while. just get to the airport.
the airport! hey, wait a minute.
I am back.
I am at the airport.
good. get to a phone.
who is it?
not who. a data bank. just keep your ear to the phone and do not make a sound.
do not talk, i told you. you just screwed it up.
what am i supposed to do?
nothing. you just do nothing.
what is it?
composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
joe       go to, what the hell does that mean?!!
go-toe. it is some islands.
joe what does some island have to do with this? it is a mistake?
it is all we have got.
what do we do?
send a man there. a secret agent.
who?...  wait a minute! I am no agent, secret or otherwise. and..i'm alone.
you are not alone. but you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
joe what abilities...?
face it, we are the men for the job. besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and find the goddamn pem.
you mean...just leave.
we get on a plane.
we get on which plane?
what about money?
what about it?
i do not have any.
use my credit cards.
i can not do that.
why not?
it is illegal.
who cares?
I will get in trouble.
you are in trouble. now do it.
...and a license to kill...
well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
they will know who i am.
we will change your appearance.
it is just not enough.
it is attitude...how you carry yourself.
what is wrong with how i carry myself.
nothing, but it is yours. change it. change your whole persona.
oh yeah, to what?
you will be me.
i do not want to be you. i do not even like you, why would i want to be you?
because you got my id. now brace yourself. I am going to try something with your glands.
you leave my glands alone!
now what?
the beach.
the beach?
how else do you get seaweed under your nails?
eating sushi?
just get there.
holy shit!
what is it?
...just beautiful.
do you notice anything.
the sky, the sun, the sea... there is no one here. it is deserted. what now?
swim.
good idea!
take it easy, now. do not want you in over your head.
little late for that.
here...all the seaweed you want. now, what?
you eat it.
you eat it. you know what this stuff tastes like?
I am living on freeze dried limas and ham. just eat it.
now what?
the sand.
eat it?
eat it.
i do not want to eat it.
why not?
it is sand.
for chrissakes, it is only sand. you should see some of the stuff that is floating around in here. that sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. now eat it!
now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, I will be back in a while.
where are you going? wait!
al, are you doing anything in there?
what? what do you mean?
are you screwing with any nerves?
beautiful!
what was?
a girl.
this must be business, there is nothing else here.
follow it.
she's...pretty fast.
you are out of shape.
what is it?
she is beautiful...! what do i do?
you are beautiful..
what is happening?
she does not seem to understand.
try another language.
which language?
how should i know?
help me out, will you?
what can i do? you are on your own.
what do i do?
do not just stand there, say something.
what?
anything. aw hell...just tell her the truth.
what do you do about what?
...i'm looking for someone.
not that truth!
are not we all.
is someone else here?
no. no one to speak of.
i am confused. or maybe it is you.
...blake
blake?
the poet...something he said...
yes?
.
.
blake said that?
yeah. one of the corniest lines i ever heard.
sorry...
it will remind me of you.
works like a charm when i use it. you did not say it right.
I will be right there.
where?
dinner...tonight.
oh...i can't. business.
wait.
wait.
where is she staying?
where are you staying?
and you.
...right here too.
have not seen you around.
touch her.
what?
touch some part of her body. trust me. it works.
does not matter.
what part what?
the best part. she will love it.
i can not do that?
do what?
let you leave without it.
without what?
I have seen that before. never had anyone actually do it.
do what? what did you do?
what is your name?
do not give her your name.
...joe.
no...you idiot!
what is so funny?
nothing...al. why do you talk   that way?
what way?
like there is someone else here.
wait. what is your name?
...rene.
what happened?
...rene...
where are you going?
to the hotel. to register.
without your pants.
maybe they will not stand on ceremony.
good thing I am here to do the thinking.
yeah. some help. that poetry really killed her.
it worked.
i made it work.
you stumbled around. remember, you have got my id, you have got to be me, not some stumblebum.
rene...
I am not some hot shot test pilot. I am not some playboy. i do not usually pick up girls.
well you did it today.
yeah. i did it.
but, you have got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
now, where would i be?
what are you looking at?
but what is it look like?
what is nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
is something glinting?
what is it?
looks like...the optic nerve. i can see out!
you really like that shirt?
this...is not going to work out.
much too blue.
not blue enough.
mind your own business.
it is my business. it is my name.
but the rest is me. I will dress like i want.
not that tie with that coat.
why not?!
what did that cost?
you want sophistication, it do not come cheap.
doesn't.
which one is she?
the beautiful one.
they both look good to me.
you have no taste.
get close to them.
that place. by the window.
how is that for fucking savoir fair!
sir?
how is that trucklhouser beer?
we have henekin, kirin... very good, sir.
this sophistication am not tough. all it takes is a credit card.
now you know what i know.
sir?
about cholesterol...you know what i know, you would have the seafood.
ahhh. good choice, sir.
you are not just after this girl, are you?
who, me?
you got a better idea, you tell me. other than her, there is no one here i know.
pan the group, will you. if you are right, at least one of them...is involved.
that is a big if.
who are they? stay on them, will you. how can we find out...wait. the glasses.
what glasses.
the drinks...stay on them.
follow that busboy.
are you serious?
the fresh tuna?..
yessir...very good sir.
i feel like an idiot.
just hold them close and stay still.
which one?
the blond...gruner. a killer.
killer!
that rene...lovely girl...a killer!
i noticed you staring.
could not help it. no offense. she is not your wife is she...?
just do not show fear.
i do not know what is going on.
it lends you an air of mystery.
who is your friend?
we met on the beach.
join us.
i do not want to intrude.
we insist.
al viola.
that name's familiar.
it is to me too.
you remind me of someone. you from the west coast?
he recognises you, throw him off.
my coast is maine, actually. we have a place in bar harbor...and a bar in sutton place.
do not get too cute.
...foreign service.
and how do you service foreigners.
well...i try to give them whatever they want.
must be a fulfilling occupation.
it keeps me busy. everybody always wants something.
what brings you here?
i came for a rest. as, i imagine, you did. to get away with it all.
you mean from it.
yes, of course.
and...you know jan gruner?
i think I have heard of you.
and you?
i just work for the travel firm.
and you, there are many places to get away. why here?
a little voice in my head.
joe, be careful!
...i've lost something. i must get it back.
what could you find in this place?
...piece of mind.
you may you find all the solitude you want.
thanks, i appreciate that.
they are all in it.
how do you know?
voice stress analyzer.
your data must be bad. everyone can not be lying all the time.
even rene?
she is the toughest to read.
maybe she is telling the truth.
can not tell. every time i try her, you look away. or you make noises. maybe you do not want to know.
come on...look at her. do not you know anything about women?... the data is skewed. we might as well go with instinct...
you again.
me still. they left you alone?
i waited for you.
why?
...i...don't know.
i guess it is a combination you do not often see. apparent attraction..
it is not apparent.
...and sort of...disinterest.
disinterest?
as if your mind's not all there.
i am sort of scattered.
can i help?
you are.
are you alright?
what is it, your charm?
this just will not work.
you are doing great with her.
not her. you!
what is it?
you can not listen. you can not watch either.
it is embarrassing.
what if she says something important?
I will be right here. I will keep it in mind. I will get a lot more from her without you butting in.
what am i supposed to do?
you got any books in there?
oh come on.
you shut down your sensors.
joe! it is 56 hours!
i mean it. you watch old tapes of the ballgame, I will fill you in... later. i mean it.
promise you what?
that you are not crazy.
i promise you that. i am not crazy. course, if i was, I would be the last to know. why do you ask?
you talk to yourself.
but i do not listen...then I would be crazy.
why do you do it?
if i was with you, i would not
you did.
that was then. this is now. who am i talking to?
you are talking to me.
and how'm i doing?
you are doing...okay.
just okay...
...ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
...naw. made that up.
who do you work for?
no one. no one at all. I am unemployed. who do you?
trans ocean travel.
is that ryuji?
no. ryuji just hires us.
hires you for what?
to organize things. meetings and travel...whenever they come here, i handle details.
how often they come here?
he likes the quiet. they were here last week.
and you, what do you like?
that depends...
what happened?
i do not know!
what she say. what did you get out of her?
ahhh...works...ryuji... travel...just business...she's.. fine arts, university of tokyo..
is that all?
oh, you were right. they have all been here before... met just last week.
she is got the most beautiful...s
shit! you are in love.
and on my time.
it is not your time. i get time off.
you get time off to sleep.
I have got twenty hours left. i could die in here. and you are falling in love.
joe it is not love. it is like. it is real strong like. and i got your information. now, get off my back!
some friend you are! you know what i hope?
no. what do you hope? al  i hope. i just hope. that someday, you are real small, and you have got no time. and you got no one to help you. and you depend on me. and you know what I will do?
no. what will you do.
i...i'll got to the movies. that is what I will do!
you been had. we have.
it was not like that.
some agent you are.
why do not you get out of my face.
bingo.
you found her.
better. i found ryuji.
that is good. it is not better. where?
osaka.
osaka?
fountainhead of high-tech.
do not you think i stand out like this.
we are trying to stand out. right near his address. easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
I am running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. i do not speak their language, they do not speak mine. i do not even know where i am. what is going to present itse........
what do i do?
follow her.
on what?
run, stupid!
come on, she is getting away.
i can not keep up.
beer. and cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
that is not funny.
sapporo..
just stay here and rest.
where are you going?
down to your heart. I am going to clean some fat out before you drop on me.
wait a minute. wait a minute. al, you leave my heart alone...
`joe. I am here. you are okay.
what do i do?
relax. let me do this.
relax. make your mind a blank.
it is a blank. this is no time for zen.
what are you doing? wait a minute. lets think this through.
you think. that is what you are good at.
joe! what happened to you?
why did you run off?
why did you leave?
they left. i had to go with them.
why did not you tell me?
why did you stay with me?
wanted to get to know you.
why?
you seemed interesting.
who else is interested in me?
what do you mean?
your friends, did they ask about me?
they kidded me a little.
what did you tell them?
there is not much to tell.
why did they leave?
i do not know, ryuji said there was a change of plans.
you work for ryuji?
sometimes. i told you i did.
were you working for him last night?
last night?
did he put you up to it? did he ask you to sleep with me?
no, he did not do that.
he didn't.
no.
who did?
you did.
yeah...you've fallen for her.
i told you, i have a feeling...
one of your instincts?
i know she is not with them. i know something else. what is bothering you is not her.
do not touch a thing.
do not worry!
I am not worried, I am not going to eat it.
this is a tough place to keep kosher.
...drink it.
too late.
excuse me?
could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...what is it?
you just got a mickey.
ryuji bandaio. grown near here.
what next!
drink lots of water.
i can't...
you have to! quickly!
...imagine a better grape for the region.
what are you doing?
trying to analyze this stuff. now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
ow!
a hard left. a hard left.
door to the right. get up and run.
i can not see a thing.
neither can they.
what?
never mind, just say it.

he was with gruner!
you were with gruner!
i can't. he did not do anything. thanks to you.
why are you on to him?
we have had thefts of our new stuff ...gruner deals in this... a big deal is going down now. i went to see if gruner had anything to sell. but he did not make any moves...and when you arrived, he backed off.
why did you invite me here?
someone is selling. you followed us. if it is not him, it must be you. if it is not you, it must be him... you scared him off.
what about the others.
i do not know.
you are leaving.
food does not agree with me.
I am leaving too.
why?
this business is over.
I am sorry. what will you do?
go back to tokyo. try to get another tour....you're following gruner?
I am just on vacation.
now, so am i...what's so interesting about him?
no!
oh, i can't.
good.
i need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
no. you can not trust her.
you know where he went?
what is he done?
he stole something. from a friend of mine.
he must be a good friend.
we are very close.
what did he steal?
a chip. goes in a computer.
one chip?
the most important one. can you help me find him?
how do you know you can trust me?
got to trust someone.
i do not know. he mentioned a city.
what is it?
hiroshima.
get your things.
hiroshima! she is going, with us? are you out of your mind.
probably.
i do not trust her.
then why let her out of our sight? besides, she is all we have got...
you do not believe me.
oh sure.
then why are you smiling like that?
lots of my clients are rich guys... they like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
you think I am like that?
what is gruner like?
they would never talk in front of me. they would walk away up the beach. nervous about something.
who was?
ryuji and gruner.
and dieter.
friend of gruner. just went along for the party.
and you?
it was a good job. not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
it is him.
come on.
where we going?
beats me.
this boat does not go anywhere. just toots around the inland sea.
must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
then where is the chip.
plenty of circuits in a walkman...
I have got an idea.
i was afraid of that.
what?
he plays it all the time.
you sure this will work?
not sure at all.
well at least talk it up, then. i feel like an idiot.
just say the words. just like i told you.
what was it? what did i say?
you said 100,000 yen for the right sony walkman.
haka xuki.
haka xuki. what is that mean?
cash.
now what?
we figure out if it is in here.
how?
why do not you get us some food. this may take some time.
left...the one with the red dot.
well...?
it is not the one...wait... there is a label.
that must be him. water taxi.
get us one.
too late, they will not come back out till morning.
he hung us up dry.
while he makes the run.
where?
where what?
where would you go to sell a chip?
we have ruined his market in japan.. where is dieter?
dieter?
if gruner led us away, who would he lead us away from?
hong kong.
what?
dieter's gone to shoot a still job. hong kong.
wait a minute! how did you know dieter was coming here?
i asked him.
oh.
why did you ask him.
he is a client of mine! what is the matter. you can not suspect dieter. he is a famous photographer. he makes millions.
maybe I am wrong. then gruner will not be here.
what are you doing here, where have you been?
i have a new client.
that crazy guy?
yes. joe.
well, I am glad to see you. sorry things broke up like that.
it is just money.
hey, sit in the car. I will get you a fee. make up for what you lost on the tour.
it is in the watch. he lead us on that chase while dieter brought the chip into hong kong.
and dieter?
he must not know. gruner just made the switch back.
then, why did he lead us here.
he didn't. he left us that walkman chip to confuse us. would have kept most people busy. we were too fast for him.
do it.
i can not handle that thing.
do not worry, i can.
what?
i said just relax. I am in full control.
are you alright?
just fine. I will do the driving from now on.
aim just in front of his face.
aim what?
do not do it!
just give me the keys.
whatever it is, do not do it.
holy...
...shit! it is just money.
he aready made the deal..
the man we want has the pem, and is across the border by now.
dieter!
gruner switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to chiang cho.
chiang cho?
...across the border. come on!
that is not this direction. it is back the other way.
you have  been there?
i know the territory.
you coming along?
I am against it.
i insist.
so do i.
this going to work?
maybe they are expecting gruner. I am going to be him.
he is dutch. you can not even speak dutch.
there is a lot you do not know.
and do not let her know, either.
this may hurt.
well, do not let it. what are you doing?
you did not tell us you were coming?
then how did you know?
you have cut your hair?
i dyed it. we are all getting old.
pem115!
**?!!
newer, more powerful design.
pretty advanced, is not it?
ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. looks like all they need is the chip.
do something.
what exactly?
i do not know.
can you fly this?
do not worry.
why not?
can you?
sure i can, can not i?
what happened?
losing power. the laser drained it.
what happened?
i can not fly it.
what'd...you forget?
be quiet.
where have you been?
never mind that, where are we now.
we are in a dungeon. how do we get out?
gimme a minute.
looks like you can have all you want.
i can always flush you down the toilet.
keep thinking.
i have been... i think you are right.
about what?
dieter asked where i was. he expected me here. maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
rene?
she works for them.
now, you are too suspicious.
you were the one who was always suspicious of her!
i was wrong. she tried to help us get away.
no. she just stayed with us. like she did all along.
are you alright?
yes. no. i'm...okay. they can not do this. they can not hold us here.
looks like they can. what did they do?
they asked about you.
what did you tell them?
that i really do not know.
now what?
they will listen to what we say in here.
she is beautiful.
you have changed your mind.
what? oh, about dieter, yes. it was him. gruner works for him.
why?
not really. truth is...i was ..jealous. of you.
thing is...i think I am in love with her.
oh no!
what a mess.
you can say that again. what do we do?
nothing we can do.
i know it is no good.  I have no right to be jealous.
she is in love with you. anyone can see that.
they can?
what?
they can hold us here forever. nobody knows about us.
can not you do something?
I am sorry i got you into this.
it was my choice.
you are a lucky man.
yeah, sure.
do not blame yourself, i did not have to come along.
why did you, then?
for you.
she is so lovely. it is all my fault...i was wrong.
you are lovely.
i'm...scared.
look, i do not know how we are going to get out of this.
i do not know how we are going to get out of this, but we will, somehow.
i want you to know how much i appreciate what you have done.
i want to thank you for what you have done.
i did not do anything.
i know we fight, but i do not mean it. you are quite a guy. no one else could have dealt with this.
awwww...
i mean it!  no one else would have helped. i take it all back, everything I have said about you.
i encouraged you to come here. my fault as much as yours.
i was...crazy...desperate. i took it out on you. i did not mean it. i know what she sees in you. you are kind and you are brave. if i ever get out of you, I will be glad to call you my friend.
do not worry, i owe you a lot. I am not going to let us rot here. I am going to find us a way out.
I will get us out of here.
do not worry about me. you take this time for your own, you two.....
how?
what?
now what?
I have never met anyone like you.
in a way, we are like brothers... i can not have her. i want you to.
that is nice.
nice?
in my own way...i want you to know that...i love you.
uh...wonderful. i know I am strange, but in my own way, i love you
i love you too.
do not worry.
why not, what are you going to do?
escape.
just like that?
I will come back for you.
are not you a little optimistic?
you son of a bitch! you conned me!
you are going to laugh.
yes?
he is not an ordinary man.
enough romance.
he's...more. somehow, enhanced... he's...zxflbbgt!
i knew he was following us. he diverted attention, exposed ryuji's trap..
rene?
she found out what she could ...and delivered him here.
impossible.
I will prove it. we will repeat their procedures...put a man in our pod, bring it down, and then...inject him.
if there is a pod inside him, we will find it, and bring it out for study.
who is our little man?
me.
no. if anything happened, you would be stuck in there like he was.
i take the last chip in with me. i use it, to control re-enlargement, from inside.
what happened?
joe's escaped. dieter's in him.
in him?
it is a long story.
ya hyutn slulptsa?
what kind of a deal?
let us get to the border!
then what?
i knew you were trouble.
trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
kiss her you fool.
her?
who are you? who do you work for?
does not matter. I am on your side.
i knew it. i told him.
now what?
we just do not stop.
how about a deal?
we will let you go. you leave the pods and the pem.
what are you doing?
sending what we know back to u.s.t. via satellite.
he can not help us.
do something!
do what? i do not know. I am no good at this.
you are, I have seen you.
it was not me. it was him.
it was you.
he told me what to do.
but you did it. it was you.
it was me. he just told me how...i wish he could tell me now.
if he was able, what would he say.
come on.
that is twenty feet high.
like al says..."under stress, the human body is capable of impossible feats.
they have stolen state property.
what a nerve!
riuji?
i told you, i work for him.
what is it?
we are not moving fast enough for him.
he wants to apologise.
he should do it in person ...i mean ex person.
yeah...i have to get away.
i know a nice island.
