kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
i'm working on it. soon as i find the right nerve bundle.
nerve bundle! what are you doing? you just leave the nerve bundles right where they are.
who are you?
who am i?
yeah...who?
well...if you're in my head... to you, i'm...god!
quit screwing around, this is important.
it's my head, i'll be the judge of that. anyway, who are you?
i told you, my name is al.
what are you doing in my head, al?
you've heard of the pem114...
that a new datsun?
are you threatening me?
i'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
look! i didn't ask to be in you. don't blame me for it. you did it.
me? what'd i do?
yeah. what did you do? you explain it. ...why i'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. explain that!
i don't know what you're talking about.
the nicholson node. i suppose you haven't heard of that either.
no.
you've heard of u.s.t.?
i just went there for a job.
then how'd i get here?
i know...it sounds insane.
you said it.
what are you doing?
loading a gun.
what for?
kill myself.
are you crazy?
yep.
don't do it.  don't aim at the head.

you're not crazy.
hear voices don't i.
of course you do!
then i'm crazy.
you're not crazy. don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
you're gonna explain.
yeah joe why there's a little man in my head?
yeah.
why he's argumentative?
yes...yes...i'll explain it all. just put the gun down.
you'll be alive.
with a man in my head...
yeah.
what was that?
who was that? somebody out there?
you weren't listening!
sorry...all this...buzzing in my head.  why don't i just take you back to ust?
why don't you?
no they won't.
why not?
i'll talk to them.
oh...gooood!
i'll tell you what to say.
if i get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
if i'm real, they'll get me out. if i'm not, they'll treat you. either way you'll be better off than you are now. you'll get a reward.
anyone there?
no one. maybe i dreamed it all up.
behind us?
still clear. just a motorcycle.
what's that?
nothing. just the cyclist. he's passed us.
what'd he look like?
he's not the problem. it's the van in the back.
what do i do?
outrun them.
this is a fiesta!
now what?
whatever you do, just...don't stop.
i wouldn't say that.
then what are you stopping for?
get your breathing down. you sound like a cement mixer.
can't see a goddamn thi..
i want out.
too late...they want you.
why? al  you know too much.
i don't know anything. i just want to go home.
you have no choice, you're involved. will you help?
calm down! act rational.
how do you act when someone trys to kill you?
now, joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
no, it wasn't, it was intentional.
why would we want to hurt you?
not you. them.
who?
i don't know who.
i don't know...to get al.
no. don't tell the guards.
al?
the little man in my...  ...head...
must be delayed effects of the drug... i'll get him out of here.
he work for us?
ah...no sir. he was here for a job interview.
what job?
doesn't matter. then put him away.
sir?
private clinic. best of care. total privacy. we'll pay all costs.
bit expensive, sir.
it's the least we can do. after all, it's our responsibility.
did you hear that?
yeah.  al wants to talk to you!
what'd he say, how's he know about al?
what does he know?
too much.
look, nobody knows we did it.
whoever took it does.
it'l take months.
so we better get started.
what about al...
it can't take that long.
why?
joe or what?
i don't know. i don't want to find out.
they could put you back in the tube..
i'd be helpless and useless. they don't have the pem. without that...there's no chance.
well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
they're busy covering their asses. they're not the type of people we need."
yeah...who is?
i am. you are.
you are crazy!
you're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...we'll have to do it on our own.
what do you mean we.
you gotta help.
i did. i brought you back here.
we're a team...my...talent. your... mobility.
thanks.
think of the scientific data we'll gain. come on, lets get out of here.
i'm not leaving until you do.
i'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
of course you're not. we'll take good care of you.
ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
find you?
i'm not gonna make it easy.
they'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
ahhh...nothing.
been complaning of hallucinations.
not...complaining, actually.
been hearing voices.
was quite excited, when he came in...
much better now, thank you. just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
sue them.
i'll sue.
sue who?
you...him...ust.
i don't like the sound of that.
we have to get out of here.
door's locked.
see the codelock? punch this in. 26993
now what.
go out, take your first left.
just walk down the hall?
with authority!
which way do i go?
what does it say.
corridor a.
take a left and your next right.
where are we going?
a lab and equipment.
is it familiar? have you been here before.
i was thirsty. he told me to get a drink.
who did?
the man.
oh my god...what did he look like, the man?
i can't remember..
like the guys that attacked us.
what do you mean?
black suits and helmets.
that's it. they know i'm in here. we've got to find them.
that's not a good idea.
they think we're safe here. they don't really need us. they're probably long gone.
gone where?
don't know.
you need id in there?
you do. to get out of here. you're gonna be me.
i don't wanna be you. i wanna go home.
you can't go home. when ust finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
anything...a feeling...a smell..?
nothing!
wait a minute. the fight. where did he get you?
just scratched my arm, why?
i'll be out of touch for a while. just get to the airport.
the airport! hey, wait a minute.
i'm back.
i'm at the airport.
good. get to a phone.
who is it?
not who. a data bank. just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
don't talk, i told you. you just screwed it up.
what am i supposed to do?
nothing. you just do nothing.
what is it?
composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
joe       go to, what the hell does that mean?!!
go-toe. it's some islands.
joe what does some island have to do with this? it's a mistake?
it's all we've got.
what do we do?
send a man there. a secret agent.
who?...  wait a minute! i'm no agent, secret or otherwise. and..i'm alone.
you are not alone. but you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
joe what abilities...?
face it, we're the men for the job. besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and find the goddamn pem.
you mean...just leave.
we get on a plane.
we get on which plane?
what about money?
what about it?
i don't have any.
use my credit cards.
i can't do that.
why not?
it's illegal.
who cares?
i'll get in trouble.
you are in trouble. now do it.
...and a license to kill...
well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
they'll know who i am.
we'll change your appearance.
it's just not enough.
it's attitude...how you carry yourself.
what's wrong with how i carry myself.
nothing, but it's yours. change it. change your whole persona.
oh yeah, to what?
you'll be me.
i don't want to be you. i don't even like you, why would i want to be you?
because you got my id. now brace yourself. i'm gonna try something with your glands.
you leave my glands alone!
now what?
the beach.
the beach?
how else do you get seaweed under your nails?
eating sushi?
just get there.
holy shit!
what is it?
...just beautiful.
do you notice anything.
the sky, the sun, the sea... there's no one here. it's deserted. what now?
swim.
good idea!
take it easy, now. don't want you in over your head.
little late for that.
here...all the seaweed you want. now, what?
you eat it.
you eat it. you know what this stuff tastes like?
i'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. just eat it.
now what?
the sand.
eat it?
eat it.
i don't want to eat it.
why not?
it's sand.
for chrissakes, it's only sand. you should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. that sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. now eat it!
now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, i'll be back in a while.
where are you going? wait!
al, are you doing anything in there?
what? what do you mean?
are you screwing with any nerves?
beautiful!
what was?
a girl.
this must be business, there's nothing else here.
follow it.
she's...pretty fast.
you're out of shape.
what is it?
she's beautiful...! what do i do?
you're beautiful..
what's happening?
she doesn't seem to understand.
try another language.
which language?
how should i know?
help me out, will you?
what can i do? you're on your own.
what do i do?
don't just stand there, say something.
what?
anything. aw hell...just tell her the truth.
what do you do about what?
...i'm looking for someone.
not that truth!
aren't we all.
is someone else here?
no. no one to speak of.
i am confused. or maybe it's you.
...blake
blake?
the poet...something he said...
yes?
.
.
blake said that?
yeah. one of the corniest lines i ever heard.
sorry...
it'll remind me of you.
works like a charm when i use it. you didn't say it right.
i'll be right there.
where?
dinner...tonight.
oh...i can't. business.
wait.
wait.
where is she staying?
where are you staying?
and you.
...right here too.
haven't seen you around.
touch her.
what?
touch some part of her body. trust me. it works.
doesn't matter.
what part what?
the best part. she'll love it.
i can't do that?
do what?
let you leave without it.
without what?
i've seen that before. never had anyone actually do it.
do what? what'd you do?
what is your name?
don't give her your name.
...joe.
no...you idiot!
what's so funny?
nothing...al. why do you talk   that way?
what way?
like there's someone else here.
wait. what's your name?
...rene.
what happened?
...rene...
where are you going?
to the hotel. to register.
without your pants.
maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
good thing i'm here to do the thinking.
yeah. some help. that poetry really killed her.
it worked.
i made it work.
you stumbled around. remember, you've got my id, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
rene...
i'm not some hot shot test pilot. i'm not some playboy. i don't usually pick up girls.
well you did it today.
yeah. i did it.
but, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
now, where would i be?
what are you looking at?
but what's it look like?
what's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
is something glinting?
what is it?
looks like...the optic nerve. i can see out!
you really like that shirt?
this...is not going to work out.
much too blue.
not blue enough.
mind your own business.
it is my business. it's my name.
but the rest is me. i'll dress like i want.
not that tie with that coat.
why not?!
what did that cost?
you want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
doesn't.
which one is she?
the beautiful one.
they both look good to me.
you have no taste.
get close to them.
that place. by the window.
how's that for fucking savoir fair!
sir?
how's that trucklhouser beer?
we have henekin, kirin... very good, sir.
this sophistication ain't tough. all it takes is a credit card.
now you know what i know.
sir?
about cholesterol...you know what i know, you'd have the seafood.
ahhh. good choice, sir.
you're not just after this girl, are you?
who, me?
you got a better idea, you tell me. other than her, there's no one here i know.
pan the group, will you. if you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
that's a big if.
who are they? stay on them, will you. how can we find out...wait. the glasses.
what glasses.
the drinks...stay on them.
follow that busboy.
are you serious?
the fresh tuna?..
yessir...very good sir.
i feel like an idiot.
just hold them close and stay still.
which one?
the blond...gruner. a killer.
killer!
that rene...lovely girl...a killer!
i noticed you staring.
couldn't help it. no offense. she's not your wife is she...?
just don't show fear.
i don't know what's going on.
it lends you an air of mystery.
who is your friend?
we met on the beach.
join us.
i don't want to intrude.
we insist.
al viola.
that name's familiar.
it is to me too.
you remind me of someone. you from the west coast?
he recognises you, throw him off.
my coast is maine, actually. we have a place in bar harbor...and a bar in sutton place.
don't get too cute.
...foreign service.
and how do you service foreigners.
well...i try to give them whatever they want.
must be a fulfilling occupation.
it keeps me busy. everybody always wants something.
what brings you here?
i came for a rest. as, i imagine, you did. to get away with it all.
you mean from it.
yes, of course.
and...you know jan gruner?
i think i've heard of you.
and you?
i just work for the travel firm.
and you, there are many places to get away. why here?
a little voice in my head.
joe, be careful!
...i've lost something. i must get it back.
what could you find in this place?
...piece of mind.
you may you find all the solitude you want.
thanks, i appreciate that.
they're all in it.
how do you know?
voice stress analyzer.
your data must be bad. everyone can't be lying all the time.
even rene?
she's the toughest to read.
maybe she's telling the truth.
can't tell. every time i try her, you look away. or you make noises. maybe you don't want to know.
come on...look at her. don't you know anything about women?... the data is skewed. we might as well go with instinct...
you again.
me still. they left you alone?
i waited for you.
why?
...i...don't know.
i guess it's a combination you don't often see. apparent attraction..
it's not apparent.
...and sort of...disinterest.
disinterest?
as if your mind's not all there.
i am sort of scattered.
can i help?
you are.
are you alright?
what is it, your charm?
this just won't work.
you're doing great with her.
not her. you!
what is it?
you can't listen. you can't watch either.
it's embarrassing.
what if she says something important?
i'll be right here. i'll keep it in mind. i'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
what am i supposed to do?
you got any books in there?
oh come on.
you shut down your sensors.
joe! it's 56 hours!
i mean it. you watch old tapes of the ballgame, i'll fill you in... later. i mean it.
promise you what?
that you're not crazy.
i promise you that. i am not crazy. course, if i was, i'd be the last to know. why do you ask?
you talk to yourself.
but i don't listen...then i'd be crazy.
why do you do it?
if i was with you, i wouldn't
you did.
that was then. this is now. who am i talking to?
you're talking to me.
and how'm i doing?
you're doing...okay.
just okay...
...ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
...naw. made that up.
who do you work for?
no one. no one at all. i'm unemployed. who do you?
trans ocean travel.
is that ryuji?
no. ryuji just hires us.
hires you for what?
to organize things. meetings and travel...whenever they come here, i handle details.
how often they come here?
he likes the quiet. they were here last week.
and you, what do you like?
that depends...
what happened?
i don't know!
what she say. what'd you get out of her?
ahhh...works...ryuji... travel...just business...she's.. fine arts, university of tokyo..
is that all?
oh, you were right. they've all been here before... met just last week.
she's got the most beautiful...s
shit! you're in love.
and on my time.
it's not your time. i get time off.
you get time off to sleep.
i've got twenty hours left. i could die in here. and you're falling in love.
joe it's not love. it's like. it's real strong like. and i got your information. now, get off my back!
some friend you are! you know what i hope?
no. what do you hope? al  i hope. i just hope. that someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. and you got no one to help you. and you depend on me. and you know what i'll do?
no. what will you do.
i...i'll got to the movies. that's what i'll do!
you been had. we have.
it wasn't like that.
some agent you are.
why don't you get out of my face.
bingo.
you found her.
better. i found ryuji.
that's good. it's not better. where?
osaka.
osaka?
fountainhead of high-tech.
don't you think i stand out like this.
we are trying to stand out. right near his address. easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
i'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. i don't speak their language, they don't speak mine. i don't even know where i am. what's going to present itse........
what do i do?
follow her.
on what?
run, stupid!
come on, she's getting away.
i can't keep up.
beer. and cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
that's not funny.
sapporo..
just stay here and rest.
where are you going?
down to your heart. i'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
wait a minute. wait a minute. al, you leave my heart alone...
`joe. i'm here. you're okay.
what do i do?
relax. let me do this.
relax. make your mind a blank.
it is a blank. this is no time for zen.
what are you doing? wait a minute. lets think this through.
you think. that's what you're good at.
joe! what happened to you?
why'd you run off?
why did you leave?
they left. i had to go with them.
why didn't you tell me?
why did you stay with me?
wanted to get to know you.
why?
you seemed interesting.
who else is interested in me?
what do you mean?
your friends, did they ask about me?
they kidded me a little.
what did you tell them?
there's not much to tell.
why did they leave?
i don't know, ryuji said there was a change of plans.
you work for ryuji?
sometimes. i told you i did.
were you working for him last night?
last night?
did he put you up to it? did he ask you to sleep with me?
no, he didn't do that.
he didn't.
no.
who did?
you did.
yeah...you've fallen for her.
i told you, i have a feeling...
one of your instincts?
i know she's not with them. i know something else. what's bothering you isn't her.
don't touch a thing.
don't worry!
i'm not worried, i'm not going to eat it.
this is a tough place to keep kosher.
...drink it.
too late.
excuse me?
could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...what is it?
you just got a mickey.
ryuji bandaio. grown near here.
what next!
drink lots of water.
i can't...
you have to! quickly!
...imagine a better grape for the region.
what are you doing?
trying to analyze this stuff. now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
ow!
a hard left. a hard left.
door to the right. get up and run.
i can't see a thing.
neither can they.
what?
never mind, just say it.

he was with gruner!
you were with gruner!
i can't. he didn't do anything. thanks to you.
why are you on to him?
we've had thefts of our new stuff ...gruner deals in this... a big deal is going down now. i went to see if gruner had anything to sell. but he didn't make any moves...and when you arrived, he backed off.
why'd you invite me here?
someone is selling. you followed us. if it's not him, it must be you. if it's not you, it must be him... you scared him off.
what about the others.
i don't know.
you're leaving.
food doesn't agree with me.
i'm leaving too.
why?
this business is over.
i'm sorry. what will you do?
go back to tokyo. try to get another tour....you're following gruner?
i'm just on vacation.
now, so am i...what's so interesting about him?
no!
oh, i can't.
good.
i need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
no. you can't trust her.
you know where he went?
what's he done?
he stole something. from a friend of mine.
he must be a good friend.
we're very close.
what'd he steal?
a chip. goes in a computer.
one chip?
the most important one. can you help me find him?
how do you know you can trust me?
got to trust someone.
i don't know. he mentioned a city.
what is it?
hiroshima.
get your things.
hiroshima! she's going, with us? are you out of your mind.
probably.
i don't trust her.
then why let her out of our sight? besides, she's all we've got...
you don't believe me.
oh sure.
then why are you smiling like that?
lots of my clients are rich guys... they like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
you think i'm like that?
what's gruner like?
they'd never talk in front of me. they'd walk away up the beach. nervous about something.
who was?
ryuji and gruner.
and dieter.
friend of gruner. just went along for the party.
and you?
it was a good job. not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
it's him.
come on.
where we going?
beats me.
this boat doesn't go anywhere. just toots around the inland sea.
must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
then where's the chip.
plenty of circuits in a walkman...
i've got an idea.
i was afraid of that.
what?
he plays it all the time.
you sure this will work?
not sure at all.
well at least talk it up, then. i feel like an idiot.
just say the words. just like i told you.
what was it? what'd i say?
you said 100,000 yen for the right sony walkman.
haka xuki.
haka xuki. what's that mean?
cash.
now what?
we figure out if it's in here.
how?
why don't you get us some food. this may take some time.
left...the one with the red dot.
well...?
it's not the one...wait... there's a label.
that must be him. water taxi.
get us one.
too late, they won't come back out till morning.
he hung us up dry.
while he makes the run.
where?
where what?
where would you go to sell a chip?
we've ruined his market in japan.. where's dieter?
dieter?
if gruner led us away, who'd he lead us away from?
hong kong.
what?
dieter's gone to shoot a still job. hong kong.
wait a minute! how'd you know dieter was coming here?
i asked him.
oh.
why'd you ask him.
he's a client of mine! what's the matter. you can't suspect dieter. he's a famous photographer. he makes millions.
maybe i'm wrong. then gruner won't be here.
what are you doing here, where've you been?
i have a new client.
that crazy guy?
yes. joe.
well, i'm glad to see you. sorry things broke up like that.
it's just money.
hey, sit in the car. i'll get you a fee. make up for what you lost on the tour.
it's in the watch. he lead us on that chase while dieter brought the chip into hong kong.
and dieter?
he must not know. gruner just made the switch back.
then, why'd he lead us here.
he didn't. he left us that walkman chip to confuse us. would have kept most people busy. we were too fast for him.
do it.
i can't handle that thing.
don't worry, i can.
what?
i said just relax. i'm in full control.
are you alright?
just fine. i'll do the driving from now on.
aim just in front of his face.
aim what?
don't do it!
just give me the keys.
whatever it is, don't do it.
holy...
...shit! it's just money.
he aready made the deal..
the man we want has the pem, and is across the border by now.
dieter!
gruner switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to chiang cho.
chiang cho?
...across the border. come on!
that's not this direction. it's back the other way.
you've  been there?
i know the territory.
you coming along?
i'm against it.
i insist.
so do i.
this going to work?
maybe they're expecting gruner. i'm gonna be him.
he's dutch. you can't even speak dutch.
there's a lot you don't know.
and don't let her know, either.
this may hurt.
well, don't let it. what are you doing?
you didn't tell us you were coming?
then how did you know?
you've cut your hair?
i dyed it. we're all getting old.
pem115!
**?!!
newer, more powerful design.
pretty advanced, isn't it?
ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. looks like all they need is the chip.
do something.
what exactly?
i don't know.
can you fly this?
don't worry.
why not?
can you?
sure i can, can't i?
what happened?
losing power. the laser drained it.
what happened?
i can't fly it.
what'd...you forget?
be quiet.
where've you been?
never mind that, where are we now.
we are in a dungeon. how do we get out?
gimme a minute.
looks like you can have all you want.
i can always flush you down the toilet.
keep thinking.
i have been... i think you're right.
about what?
dieter asked where i was. he expected me here. maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
rene?
she works for them.
now, you're too suspicious.
you were the one who was always suspicious of her!
i was wrong. she tried to help us get away.
no. she just stayed with us. like she did all along.
are you alright?
yes. no. i'm...okay. they can't do this. they can't hold us here.
looks like they can. what did they do?
they asked about you.
what did you tell them?
that i really don't know.
now what?
they'll listen to what we say in here.
she is beautiful.
you've changed your mind.
what? oh, about dieter, yes. it was him. gruner works for him.
why?
not really. truth is...i was ..jealous. of you.
thing is...i think i'm in love with her.
oh no!
what a mess.
you can say that again. what do we do?
nothing we can do.
i know it's no good.  i've no right to be jealous.
she's in love with you. anyone can see that.
they can?
what?
they can hold us here forever. nobody knows about us.
can't you do something?
i'm sorry i got you into this.
it was my choice.
you're a lucky man.
yeah, sure.
don't blame yourself, i didn't have to come along.
why did you, then?
for you.
she's so lovely. it's all my fault...i was wrong.
you're lovely.
i'm...scared.
look, i don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
i don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
i want you to know how much i appreciate what you've done.
i want to thank you for what you've done.
i didn't do anything.
i know we fight, but i don't mean it. you're quite a guy. no one else could have dealt with this.
awwww...
i mean it!  no one else would have helped. i take it all back, everything i've said about you.
i encouraged you to come here. my fault as much as yours.
i was...crazy...desperate. i took it out on you. i didn't mean it. i know what she sees in you. you're kind and you're brave. if i ever get out of you, i'll be glad to call you my friend.
don't worry, i owe you a lot. i'm not gonna let us rot here. i'm gonna find us a way out.
i'll get us out of here.
don't worry about me. you take this time for your own, you two.....
how?
what?
now what?
i've never met anyone like you.
in a way, we're like brothers... i can't have her. i want you to.
that's nice.
nice?
in my own way...i want you to know that...i love you.
uh...wonderful. i know i'm strange, but in my own way, i love you
i love you too.
don't worry.
why not, what are you going to do?
escape.
just like that?
i'll come back for you.
aren't you a little optimistic?
you son of a bitch! you conned me!
you're gonna laugh.
yes?
he's not an ordinary man.
enough romance.
he's...more. somehow, enhanced... he's...zxflbbgt!
i knew he was following us. he diverted attention, exposed ryuji's trap..
rene?
she found out what she could ...and delivered him here.
impossible.
i'll prove it. we'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our pod, bring it down, and then...inject him.
if there is a pod inside him, we'll find it, and bring it out for study.
who's our little man?
me.
no. if anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
i take the last chip in with me. i use it, to control re-enlargement, from inside.
what happened?
joe's escaped. dieter's in him.
in him?
it's a long story.
ya hyutn slulptsa?
what kind of a deal?
let us get to the border!
then what?
i knew you were trouble.
trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
kiss her you fool.
her?
who are you? who do you work for?
doesn't matter. i'm on your side.
i knew it. i told him.
now what?
we just don't stop.
how about a deal?
we'll let you go. you leave the pods and the pem.
what are you doing?
sending what we know back to u.s.t. via satellite.
he can't help us.
do something!
do what? i don't know. i'm no good at this.
you are, i've seen you.
it wasn't me. it was him.
it was you.
he told me what to do.
but you did it. it was you.
it was me. he just told me how...i wish he could tell me now.
if he was able, what would he say.
come on.
that's twenty feet high.
like al says..."under stress, the human body is capable of impossible feats.
they have stolen state property.
what a nerve!
riuji?
i told you, i work for him.
what is it?
we're not moving fast enough for him.
he wants to apologise.
he should do it in person ...i mean ex person.
yeah...i have to get away.
i know a nice island.
joe doakes? it's quarter to 10...
i'm sorry. we're running behind. so many applicants...so few jobs... if you'll just have a seat.
i have a seat. i've had it since nine.
...mr. athol will be with you as soon as possible. will you be able to wait?
is there anything else?
a drink...
water fountain's through that door, down the hall.
thanks.
right there.
thank you.

why?
you can't take that.
why not?
the experiment. the danger...
it's alright.

...i need to make a phone call.
do me a favor, al.
yeah?
shut up!
somebody's been here.
where are we now?
my place, can't you see?
no.
you're in my head, you can talk to me and hear what i say, but you can't see anything.
right.
kind of an oversight, wouldn't you say.
i'm working on it. soon as i find the right nerve bundle.
nerve bundle! what are you doing? you just leave the nerve bundles right where they are.
who are you?
who am i?
yeah...who?
well...if you're in my head... to you, i'm...god!
quit screwing around, this is important.
it's my head, i'll be the judge of that. anyway, who are you?
i told you, my name is al.
what are you doing in my head, al?
you've heard of the pem114...
that a new datsun?
are you threatening me?
i'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
look! i didn't ask to be in you. don't blame me for it. you did it.
me? what'd i do?
yeah. what did you do? you explain it. ...why i'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. explain that!
i don't know what you're talking about.
the nicholson node. i suppose you haven't heard of that either.
no.
you've heard of u.s.t.?
i just went there for a job.
then how'd i get here?
i know...it sounds insane.
you said it.
what are you doing?
loading a gun.
what for?
kill myself.
are you crazy?
yep.
don't do it.  don't aim at the head.

of course you do!
then i'm crazy.
you're not crazy. don't...wait a minute, just let me explain.
you're gonna explain.

why don't you?
no they won't.
why not?
i'll talk to them.
oh...gooood!
i'll tell you what to say.
if i get you back to the lab, will you get out of my head?
if i'm real, they'll get me out. if i'm not, they'll treat you. either way you'll be better off than you are now. you'll get a reward.
anyone there?
no one. maybe i dreamed it all up.
behind us?
still clear. just a motorcycle.
what's that?
nothing. just the cyclist. he's passed us.
what'd he look like?
he's not the problem. it's the van in the back.
what do i do?
outrun them.
this is a fiesta!
now what?
whatever you do, just...don't stop.
i wouldn't say that.
then what are you stopping for?
get your breathing down. you sound like a cement mixer.
can't see a goddamn thi..
i want out.
too late...they want you.
why? al  you know too much.
i don't know anything. i just want to go home.
you have no choice, you're involved. will you help?
calm down! act rational.
how do you act when someone trys to kill you?
now, joe, you know it was all a mistake, don't you?
no, it wasn't, it was intentional.
why would we want to hurt you?
not you. them.
who?
i don't know who.
i don't know...to get al.
no. don't tell the guards.
al?
the little man in my...  ...head...
must be delayed effects of the drug... i'll get him out of here.
he work for us?
ah...no sir. he was here for a job interview.
what job?
doesn't matter. then put him away.
sir?
private clinic. best of care. total privacy. we'll pay all costs.
bit expensive, sir.
it's the least we can do. after all, it's our responsibility.
did you hear that?
yeah.  al wants to talk to you!
what'd he say, how's he know about al?
what does he know?
too much.
look, nobody knows we did it.
whoever took it does.
it'l take months.
so we better get started.
what about al...
it can't take that long.
why?
joe or what?
i don't know. i don't want to find out.
they could put you back in the tube..
i'd be helpless and useless. they don't have the pem. without that...there's no chance.
well...they sure as hell aren't gonna get it for you.
they're busy covering their asses. they're not the type of people we need."
yeah...who is?
i am. you are.
you are crazy!
you're the one talking to a little guy in your head.  ...we'll have to do it on our own.
what do you mean we.
you gotta help.
i did. i brought you back here.
we're a team...my...talent. your... mobility.
thanks.
think of the scientific data we'll gain. come on, lets get out of here.
i'm not leaving until you do.
i'm not going anywhere until you get this guy out of my head.
of course you're not. we'll take good care of you.
ever think of what they might have to do to find me?
find you?
i'm not gonna make it easy.
they'll have to take you apart. ...piece by piece.
why don't you just get out, leave me alone.
ahhh...nothing.
been complaning of hallucinations.
not...complaining, actually.
been hearing voices.
was quite excited, when he came in...
much better now, thank you. just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
sue them.
i'll sue.
sue who?
you...him...ust.
i don't like the sound of that.
we have to get out of here.
door's locked.
see the codelock? punch this in. 26993
now what.
go out, take your first left.
just walk down the hall?
with authority!
which way do i go?
what does it say.
corridor a.
take a left and your next right.
where are we going?
a lab and equipment.
is it familiar? have you been here before.
i was thirsty. he told me to get a drink.
who did?
the man.
oh my god...what did he look like, the man?
i can't remember..
like the guys that attacked us.
what do you mean?
black suits and helmets.
that's it. they know i'm in here. we've got to find them.
that's not a good idea.
they think we're safe here. they don't really need us. they're probably long gone.
gone where?
don't know.
you need id in there?
you do. to get out of here. you're gonna be me.
i don't wanna be you. i wanna go home.
you can't go home. when ust finds we're gone, they'll come after you and put us away.
anything...a feeling...a smell..?
nothing!
wait a minute. the fight. where did he get you?
just scratched my arm, why?
i'll be out of touch for a while. just get to the airport.
the airport! hey, wait a minute.
i'm back.
i'm at the airport.
good. get to a phone.
who is it?
not who. a data bank. just keep your ear to the phone and don't make a sound.
don't talk, i told you. you just screwed it up.
what am i supposed to do?
nothing. you just do nothing.
what is it?
composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
joe       go to, what the hell does that mean?!!
go-toe. it's some islands.
joe what does some island have to do with this? it's a mistake?
it's all we've got.
what do we do?
send a man there. a secret agent.
who?...  wait a minute! i'm no agent, secret or otherwise. and..i'm alone.
you are not alone. but you are incon- picuous...and, with our abilities...
joe what abilities...?
face it, we're the men for the job. besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and find the goddamn pem.
you mean...just leave.
we get on a plane.
we get on which plane?
what about money?
what about it?
i don't have any.
use my credit cards.
i can't do that.
why not?
it's illegal.
who cares?
i'll get in trouble.
you are in trouble. now do it.
...and a license to kill...
well, if not to kill, then to bother and annoy.
they'll know who i am.
we'll change your appearance.
it's just not enough.
it's attitude...how you carry yourself.
what's wrong with how i carry myself.
nothing, but it's yours. change it. change your whole persona.
oh yeah, to what?
you'll be me.
i don't want to be you. i don't even like you, why would i want to be you?
because you got my id. now brace yourself. i'm gonna try something with your glands.
you leave my glands alone!
now what?
the beach.
the beach?
how else do you get seaweed under your nails?
eating sushi?
just get there.
holy shit!
what is it?
...just beautiful.
do you notice anything.
the sky, the sun, the sea... there's no one here. it's deserted. what now?
swim.
good idea!
take it easy, now. don't want you in over your head.
little late for that.
here...all the seaweed you want. now, what?
you eat it.
you eat it. you know what this stuff tastes like?
i'm living on freeze dried limas and ham. just eat it.
now what?
the sand.
eat it?
eat it.
i don't want to eat it.
why not?
it's sand.
for chrissakes, it's only sand. you should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. that sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. now eat it!
now lie down somewhere quiet and rest, i'll be back in a while.
where are you going? wait!
al, are you doing anything in there?
what? what do you mean?
are you screwing with any nerves?
beautiful!
what was?
a girl.
this must be business, there's nothing else here.
follow it.
she's...pretty fast.
you're out of shape.
what is it?
she's beautiful...! what do i do?
you're beautiful..
what's happening?
she doesn't seem to understand.
try another language.
which language?
how should i know?
help me out, will you?
what can i do? you're on your own.
what do i do?
don't just stand there, say something.
what?
anything. aw hell...just tell her the truth.
what do you do about what?
...i'm looking for someone.
not that truth!
aren't we all.
is someone else here?
no. no one to speak of.
i am confused. or maybe it's you.
...blake
blake?
the poet...something he said...
yes?
.
.
blake said that?
yeah. one of the corniest lines i ever heard.
sorry...
it'll remind me of you.
works like a charm when i use it. you didn't say it right.
i'll be right there.
where?
dinner...tonight.
oh...i can't. business.
wait.
wait.
where is she staying?
where are you staying?
and you.
...right here too.
haven't seen you around.
touch her.
what?
touch some part of her body. trust me. it works.
doesn't matter.
what part what?
the best part. she'll love it.
i can't do that?
do what?
let you leave without it.
without what?
i've seen that before. never had anyone actually do it.
do what? what'd you do?
what is your name?
don't give her your name.
...joe.
no...you idiot!
what's so funny?
nothing...al. why do you talk   that way?
what way?
like there's someone else here.
wait. what's your name?
...rene.
what happened?
...rene...
where are you going?
to the hotel. to register.
without your pants.
maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
good thing i'm here to do the thinking.
yeah. some help. that poetry really killed her.
it worked.
i made it work.
you stumbled around. remember, you've got my id, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
rene...
i'm not some hot shot test pilot. i'm not some playboy. i don't usually pick up girls.
well you did it today.
yeah. i did it.
but, you've got to have... sophistication ...savoir faire.
now, where would i be?
what are you looking at?
but what's it look like?
what's nothing look like? ...it looks like nothing.
is something glinting?
what is it?
looks like...the optic nerve. i can see out!
you really like that shirt?
this...is not going to work out.
much too blue.
not blue enough.
mind your own business.
it is my business. it's my name.
but the rest is me. i'll dress like i want.
not that tie with that coat.
why not?!
what did that cost?
you want sophistication, it don't come cheap.
doesn't.
which one is she?
the beautiful one.
they both look good to me.
you have no taste.
get close to them.
that place. by the window.
how's that for fucking savoir fair!
sir?
how's that trucklhouser beer?
we have henekin, kirin... very good, sir.
this sophistication ain't tough. all it takes is a credit card.
now you know what i know.
sir?
about cholesterol...you know what i know, you'd have the seafood.
ahhh. good choice, sir.
you're not just after this girl, are you?
who, me?
you got a better idea, you tell me. other than her, there's no one here i know.
pan the group, will you. if you're right, at least one of them...is involved.
that's a big if.
who are they? stay on them, will you. how can we find out...wait. the glasses.
what glasses.
the drinks...stay on them.
follow that busboy.
are you serious?
the fresh tuna?..
yessir...very good sir.
i feel like an idiot.
just hold them close and stay still.
which one?
the blond...gruner. a killer.
killer!
that rene...lovely girl...a killer!
i noticed you staring.
couldn't help it. no offense. she's not your wife is she...?
just don't show fear.
i don't know what's going on.
it lends you an air of mystery.
who is your friend?
we met on the beach.
join us.
i don't want to intrude.
we insist.
al viola.
that name's familiar.
it is to me too.
you remind me of someone. you from the west coast?
he recognises you, throw him off.
my coast is maine, actually. we have a place in bar harbor...and a bar in sutton place.
don't get too cute.
...foreign service.
and how do you service foreigners.
well...i try to give them whatever they want.
must be a fulfilling occupation.
it keeps me busy. everybody always wants something.
what brings you here?
i came for a rest. as, i imagine, you did. to get away with it all.
you mean from it.
yes, of course.
and...you know jan gruner?
i think i've heard of you.
and you?
i just work for the travel firm.
and you, there are many places to get away. why here?
a little voice in my head.
joe, be careful!
...i've lost something. i must get it back.
what could you find in this place?
...piece of mind.
you may you find all the solitude you want.
thanks, i appreciate that.
they're all in it.
how do you know?
voice stress analyzer.
your data must be bad. everyone can't be lying all the time.
even rene?
she's the toughest to read.
maybe she's telling the truth.
can't tell. every time i try her, you look away. or you make noises. maybe you don't want to know.
come on...look at her. don't you know anything about women?... the data is skewed. we might as well go with instinct...
you again.
me still. they left you alone?
i waited for you.
why?
...i...don't know.
i guess it's a combination you don't often see. apparent attraction..
it's not apparent.
...and sort of...disinterest.
disinterest?
as if your mind's not all there.
i am sort of scattered.
can i help?
you are.
are you alright?
what is it, your charm?
this just won't work.
you're doing great with her.
not her. you!
what is it?
you can't listen. you can't watch either.
it's embarrassing.
what if she says something important?
i'll be right here. i'll keep it in mind. i'll get a lot more from her without you butting in.
what am i supposed to do?
you got any books in there?
oh come on.
you shut down your sensors.
joe! it's 56 hours!
i mean it. you watch old tapes of the ballgame, i'll fill you in... later. i mean it.
promise you what?
that you're not crazy.
i promise you that. i am not crazy. course, if i was, i'd be the last to know. why do you ask?
you talk to yourself.
but i don't listen...then i'd be crazy.
why do you do it?
if i was with you, i wouldn't
you did.
that was then. this is now. who am i talking to?
you're talking to me.
and how'm i doing?
you're doing...okay.
just okay...
...ummm, you really work for the foreign service?
...naw. made that up.
who do you work for?
no one. no one at all. i'm unemployed. who do you?
trans ocean travel.
is that ryuji?
no. ryuji just hires us.
hires you for what?
to organize things. meetings and travel...whenever they come here, i handle details.
how often they come here?
he likes the quiet. they were here last week.
and you, what do you like?
that depends...
what happened?
i don't know!
what she say. what'd you get out of her?
ahhh...works...ryuji... travel...just business...she's.. fine arts, university of tokyo..
is that all?
oh, you were right. they've all been here before... met just last week.
she's got the most beautiful...s
shit! you're in love.
and on my time.
it's not your time. i get time off.
you get time off to sleep.
i've got twenty hours left. i could die in here. and you're falling in love.
joe it's not love. it's like. it's real strong like. and i got your information. now, get off my back!
some friend you are! you know what i hope?
no. what do you hope? al  i hope. i just hope. that someday, you're real small, and you've got no time. and you got no one to help you. and you depend on me. and you know what i'll do?
no. what will you do.
i...i'll got to the movies. that's what i'll do!
you been had. we have.
it wasn't like that.
some agent you are.
why don't you get out of my face.
bingo.
you found her.
better. i found ryuji.
that's good. it's not better. where?
osaka.
osaka?
fountainhead of high-tech.
don't you think i stand out like this.
we are trying to stand out. right near his address. easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
i'm running in circles in the middle of some foreign country. i don't speak their language, they don't speak mine. i don't even know where i am. what's going to present itse........
what do i do?
follow her.
on what?
run, stupid!
come on, she's getting away.
i can't keep up.
beer. and cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
that's not funny.
sapporo..
just stay here and rest.
where are you going?
down to your heart. i'm gonna clean some fat out before you drop on me.
wait a minute. wait a minute. al, you leave my heart alone...
`joe. i'm here. you're okay.
what do i do?
relax. let me do this.
relax. make your mind a blank.
it is a blank. this is no time for zen.
what are you doing? wait a minute. lets think this through.
you think. that's what you're good at.
joe! what happened to you?
why'd you run off?
why did you leave?
they left. i had to go with them.
why didn't you tell me?
why did you stay with me?
wanted to get to know you.
why?
you seemed interesting.
who else is interested in me?
what do you mean?
your friends, did they ask about me?
they kidded me a little.
what did you tell them?
there's not much to tell.
why did they leave?
i don't know, ryuji said there was a change of plans.
you work for ryuji?
sometimes. i told you i did.
were you working for him last night?
last night?
did he put you up to it? did he ask you to sleep with me?
no, he didn't do that.
he didn't.
no.
who did?
you did.
yeah...you've fallen for her.
i told you, i have a feeling...
one of your instincts?
i know she's not with them. i know something else. what's bothering you isn't her.
don't touch a thing.
don't worry!
i'm not worried, i'm not going to eat it.
this is a tough place to keep kosher.
...drink it.
too late.
excuse me?
could have been drunk a little sooner, but excellent...good character...what is it?
you just got a mickey.
ryuji bandaio. grown near here.
what next!
drink lots of water.
i can't...
you have to! quickly!
...imagine a better grape for the region.
what are you doing?
trying to analyze this stuff. now...go to the medicine shelf and take ---- and ----.
ow!
a hard left. a hard left.
door to the right. get up and run.
i can't see a thing.
neither can they.
what?
never mind, just say it.

he was with gruner!
you were with gruner!
i can't. he didn't do anything. thanks to you.
why are you on to him?
we've had thefts of our new stuff ...gruner deals in this... a big deal is going down now. i went to see if gruner had anything to sell. but he didn't make any moves...and when you arrived, he backed off.
why'd you invite me here?
someone is selling. you followed us. if it's not him, it must be you. if it's not you, it must be him... you scared him off.
what about the others.
i don't know.
you're leaving.
food doesn't agree with me.
i'm leaving too.
why?
this business is over.
i'm sorry. what will you do?
go back to tokyo. try to get another tour....you're following gruner?
i'm just on vacation.
now, so am i...what's so interesting about him?
no!
oh, i can't.
good.
i need a guide and you need a client...and $1000.
no. you can't trust her.
you know where he went?
what's he done?
he stole something. from a friend of mine.
he must be a good friend.
we're very close.
what'd he steal?
a chip. goes in a computer.
one chip?
the most important one. can you help me find him?
how do you know you can trust me?
got to trust someone.
i don't know. he mentioned a city.
what is it?
hiroshima.
get your things.
hiroshima! she's going, with us? are you out of your mind.
probably.
i don't trust her.
then why let her out of our sight? besides, she's all we've got...
you don't believe me.
oh sure.
then why are you smiling like that?
lots of my clients are rich guys... they like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
you think i'm like that?
what's gruner like?
they'd never talk in front of me. they'd walk away up the beach. nervous about something.
who was?
ryuji and gruner.
and dieter.
friend of gruner. just went along for the party.
and you?
it was a good job. not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
it's him.
come on.
where we going?
beats me.
this boat doesn't go anywhere. just toots around the inland sea.
must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
then where's the chip.
plenty of circuits in a walkman...
i've got an idea.
i was afraid of that.
what?
he plays it all the time.
you sure this will work?
not sure at all.
well at least talk it up, then. i feel like an idiot.
just say the words. just like i told you.
what was it? what'd i say?
you said 100,000 yen for the right sony walkman.
haka xuki.
haka xuki. what's that mean?
cash.
now what?
we figure out if it's in here.
how?
why don't you get us some food. this may take some time.
left...the one with the red dot.
well...?
it's not the one...wait... there's a label.
that must be him. water taxi.
get us one.
too late, they won't come back out till morning.
he hung us up dry.
while he makes the run.
where?
where what?
where would you go to sell a chip?
we've ruined his market in japan.. where's dieter?
dieter?
if gruner led us away, who'd he lead us away from?
hong kong.
what?
dieter's gone to shoot a still job. hong kong.
wait a minute! how'd you know dieter was coming here?
i asked him.
oh.
why'd you ask him.
he's a client of mine! what's the matter. you can't suspect dieter. he's a famous photographer. he makes millions.
maybe i'm wrong. then gruner won't be here.
what are you doing here, where've you been?
i have a new client.
that crazy guy?
yes. joe.
well, i'm glad to see you. sorry things broke up like that.
it's just money.
hey, sit in the car. i'll get you a fee. make up for what you lost on the tour.
it's in the watch. he lead us on that chase while dieter brought the chip into hong kong.
and dieter?
he must not know. gruner just made the switch back.
then, why'd he lead us here.
he didn't. he left us that walkman chip to confuse us. would have kept most people busy. we were too fast for him.
do it.
i can't handle that thing.
don't worry, i can.
what?
i said just relax. i'm in full control.
are you alright?
just fine. i'll do the driving from now on.
aim just in front of his face.
aim what?
don't do it!
just give me the keys.
whatever it is, don't do it.
holy...
...shit! it's just money.
he aready made the deal..
the man we want has the pem, and is across the border by now.
dieter!
gruner switched the chip to him, not from him, then he led us away again...to chiang cho.
chiang cho?
...across the border. come on!
that's not this direction. it's back the other way.
you've  been there?
i know the territory.
you coming along?
i'm against it.
i insist.
so do i.
this going to work?
maybe they're expecting gruner. i'm gonna be him.
he's dutch. you can't even speak dutch.
there's a lot you don't know.
and don't let her know, either.
this may hurt.
well, don't let it. what are you doing?
you didn't tell us you were coming?
then how did you know?
you've cut your hair?
i dyed it. we're all getting old.
pem115!
**?!!
newer, more powerful design.
pretty advanced, isn't it?
ought to be, they stole everything and reverse-engineered it. looks like all they need is the chip.
do something.
what exactly?
i don't know.
can you fly this?
don't worry.
why not?
can you?
sure i can, can't i?
what happened?
losing power. the laser drained it.
what happened?
i can't fly it.
what'd...you forget?
be quiet.
where've you been?
never mind that, where are we now.
we are in a dungeon. how do we get out?
gimme a minute.
looks like you can have all you want.
i can always flush you down the toilet.
keep thinking.
i have been... i think you're right.
about what?
dieter asked where i was. he expected me here. maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
rene?
she works for them.
now, you're too suspicious.
you were the one who was always suspicious of her!
i was wrong. she tried to help us get away.
no. she just stayed with us. like she did all along.
are you alright?
yes. no. i'm...okay. they can't do this. they can't hold us here.
looks like they can. what did they do?
they asked about you.
what did you tell them?
that i really don't know.
now what?
they'll listen to what we say in here.
she is beautiful.
you've changed your mind.
what? oh, about dieter, yes. it was him. gruner works for him.
why?
not really. truth is...i was ..jealous. of you.
thing is...i think i'm in love with her.
oh no!
what a mess.
you can say that again. what do we do?
nothing we can do.
i know it's no good.  i've no right to be jealous.
she's in love with you. anyone can see that.
they can?
what?
they can hold us here forever. nobody knows about us.
can't you do something?
i'm sorry i got you into this.
it was my choice.
you're a lucky man.
yeah, sure.
don't blame yourself, i didn't have to come along.
why did you, then?
for you.
she's so lovely. it's all my fault...i was wrong.
you're lovely.
i'm...scared.
look, i don't know how we're gonna get out of this.
i don't know how we're gonna get out of this, but we will, somehow.
i want you to know how much i appreciate what you've done.
i want to thank you for what you've done.
i didn't do anything.
i know we fight, but i don't mean it. you're quite a guy. no one else could have dealt with this.
awwww...
i mean it!  no one else would have helped. i take it all back, everything i've said about you.
i encouraged you to come here. my fault as much as yours.
i was...crazy...desperate. i took it out on you. i didn't mean it. i know what she sees in you. you're kind and you're brave. if i ever get out of you, i'll be glad to call you my friend.
don't worry, i owe you a lot. i'm not gonna let us rot here. i'm gonna find us a way out.
i'll get us out of here.
don't worry about me. you take this time for your own, you two.....
how?
what?
now what?
i've never met anyone like you.
in a way, we're like brothers... i can't have her. i want you to.
that's nice.
nice?
in my own way...i want you to know that...i love you.
uh...wonderful. i know i'm strange, but in my own way, i love you
i love you too.
don't worry.
why not, what are you going to do?
escape.
just like that?
i'll come back for you.
aren't you a little optimistic?
you son of a bitch! you conned me!
you're gonna laugh.
yes?
he's not an ordinary man.
enough romance.
he's...more. somehow, enhanced... he's...zxflbbgt!
i knew he was following us. he diverted attention, exposed ryuji's trap..
rene?
she found out what she could ...and delivered him here.
impossible.
i'll prove it. we'll repeat their procedures...put a man in our pod, bring it down, and then...inject him.
if there is a pod inside him, we'll find it, and bring it out for study.
who's our little man?
me.
no. if anything happened, you'd be stuck in there like he was.
i take the last chip in with me. i use it, to control re-enlargement, from inside.
what happened?
joe's escaped. dieter's in him.
in him?
it's a long story.
ya hyutn slulptsa?
what kind of a deal?
let us get to the border!
then what?
i knew you were trouble.
trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
kiss her you fool.
her?
who are you? who do you work for?
doesn't matter. i'm on your side.
i knew it. i told him.
now what?
we just don't stop.
how about a deal?
we'll let you go. you leave the pods and the pem.
what are you doing?
sending what we know back to u.s.t. via satellite.
he can't help us.
do something!
do what? i don't know. i'm no good at this.
you are, i've seen you.
it wasn't me. it was him.
it was you.
he told me what to do.
but you did it. it was you.
it was me. he just told me how...i wish he could tell me now.
if he was able, what would he say.
come on.
that's twenty feet high.
like al says..."under stress, the human body is capable of impossible feats.
they have stolen state property.
what a nerve!
riuji?
i told you, i work for him.
what is it?
we're not moving fast enough for him.
he wants to apologise.
he should do it in person ...i mean ex person.
yeah...i have to get away.
i know a nice island.
