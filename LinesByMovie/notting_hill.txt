even he.  hey, you could not help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
this is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
that is right -- I am at last going out on a date with the great janine and i just want to be sure I have picked the right t-shirt.
what are the choices?
well... wait for it...  first there is this one...
yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
point taken.
cool, huh?
yes -- she might think you do not have true love on your mind.
would not want that...  okay -- just one more.
well, yes, that is perfect. well done.
thanks.  great.  wish me luck.
good luck.
classic.  absolutely classic. profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
shall i go get a cappuccino?  ease the pain.
yes, better get me a half.  all i can afford.
no, thanks.  I will just look around.
fine.
that book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying.  you would be wasting your money.
really?
yes.  this one though is... very good.
i think the man who wrote it has actually been to turkey, which helps. there is also a very amusing incident with a kebab.
thanks.  I will think about it.
excuse me.
yes.
bad news.
what?
we have got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
so?
so, i saw you put that book down your trousers.
what book?
the one down your trousers.
i have not got a book down my trousers.
right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  i tell you what -- I will call the police -- and,	what can i say? -- if I am wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, i really apologize.
okay -- what if i did have a book down my trousers?
well, ideally, when i went back to the desk, you would remove the cadogan guide to bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.  see you in a sec.
sorry about that...
no, that is fine.  i was going to steal one myself but now I have changed my mind.  signed by the author, i see.
yes, we could not stop him.  if you can find an unsigned copy, it is worth an absolute fortune.
excuse me.
yes.
can i have your autograph?
what is your name?
rufus.
what does it say?
well, that is the signature -- and above, it says 'dear rufus -- you belong in jail.'
nice one.  would you like my phone number?
tempting but... no, thank you.
cappuccino as ordered.
thanks.  i do not think you will believe who was just in here.
who?  someone famous?
would be exciting if someone famous did come into the shop though, would not it?  do you know -- this is pretty incredible actually -- i once saw ringo starr.  or at least i think it was ringo.  it might have been that broke from 'fiddler on the roof,' toppy.
topol.
that is right -- topol.
but ringo starr does not look anything like topol.
no, well... he was quite a long way away.
so it could have been neither of them?
i suppose so.
right.  it is not a classic anecdotes, is it?
not classic, no.
right -- want another one?
yes.  no, wait -- let's go crazy -- I will have an orange juice.
oh jesus.
here, let me help.
nothing, nothing... look, i live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
no thank you.  i need to get my car back.
i also have a phone.  I am confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non-prostitute sense obviously.
okay.  so what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
eighteen yards.  that is my house there.
would you like a cup of tea before you go?
no thanks.
coffee?
no.
orange juice -- probably not.
something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
really, no.
would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you would just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
no.
do you always say 'no' to everything?
no.  i better be going.  thanks for your help.
you are welcome and, may i also say... heavenly.
thank you.
yes.  well.  my pleasure.
oh hi.  forget something?
i forgot my bag.
oh right.
here we go.
thanks.  well...
i apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment.  disaster...
do not worry about it.  i thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
probably best not tell anyone about this.
right.  no one.  i mean, I will tell myself sometimes but... do not worry -- i will not believe it.
bye.
there is something wrong with this yogurt.
it is not yogurt -- it is mayonnaise.
well, there you go.  on for a video fest tonight?  I have got some absolute classic.
imagine -- somewhere in the world there is a man who is allowed to kiss her.
yes, she is fairly fabulous.
martin -- your customer.
can i help you?
hey.
hi...
just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
ahm -- combination of factors really. no clean clothes...
there never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
right.  vicious circle.  and then i was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and i thought -- cool. kind of spacey.
there is something wrong with the goggles though...
no, they were prescription, so i could see all the fishes properly.
groovy.  you should do more of this stuff.
so -- any messages?
yeh, i wrote a couple down.
two?  that is it?
you want me to write down all your messages?
who were the ones you did not write down from?
ahm let's see -- ahm.  no.  gone completely.  oh no, wait.  there was -- one from your mum: she said do not forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
right.  no one else?
absolutely not.
what did she say?
well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it is anna -- and then she said, call me at the ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
which was?
absolutely no idea.  remembering one name's bad enough...
hello.
may i help you, sir?
ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I am a friend of anna scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she is staying with you...
I am sorry, we do not have anyone of that name here, sir.
no, that is right -- i know that.  she said she is using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.
yes, sir.  i have him in my mind.
and then double it -- and that is the -- what can i say -- git I am living with and he cannot remember...
try 'flintstone.'
what?
i think she said her name was 'flintstone.'
does 'flintstone' mean anything to you?
hello.  hi.  hi.
hi.
oh hi.  it is william thacker.  we, ahm i work in a bookshop.
you played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
no, I have never played anything cool in my entire life.  spike, who I will stab to death later, never gave me the message.
oh -- okay.
perhaps i could drop round for tea or something?
yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  four of the clock could be good.
right.  great.  classic.  classic.
which floor?
three.
are you sure you...?
yes.
oh.  right.
i agree.
I am sorry.  i did not get down what magazines you are from.
'horse and hound.'  the name's william whacker.  i think she might be expecting me.
okay -- take a seat.  I will check.
no -- they're... for my grandmother. she is in a hospital nearby.  thought I would kill two birds with one stone.
I am sorry.  which hospital?
do you mind me not saying -- it is a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
oh sure.  of course.
hi.
hello.
i brought these, but clearly...
sorry about not ringing back.  the whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
no, it is a stupid privacy thing.  i always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, i was mrs. bambi.
right.  ahm... the film's great... and i just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
obviously.  very difficult.
I am sorry -- i arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- i did not know what to do.
no, it is my fault, i thought this would all be over by now.  i just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  i seriously do not know what got in to me.  i just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
absolutely fine about it.
I am just a complete moron.  sorry. this is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  good dreams, obviously -- it is a dream to see you.
and what happens next in the dream?
are you busy tonight?
yes.
well, it was nice to meet you. surreal but nice.
thank you.  you are 'horse and hound's' favorite actress.  you and black beauty.  tied.
how was she?
fabulous.
wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers?
if you would like to come with me we can rush you through the others.
the others?
mr. thacker's from 'horse and hound.'
pleased to meet you.  did you like the film?
ah... yes, enormously.
well, fire away.
right, right.  ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
i did.
any bit in particular?
well, you tell me which bit you liked most -- and I will tell you if i enjoyed making it.
ahm right, right, i liked the bit in space very much.  did you enjoy making 	that bit?
is this your first film?
no -- it is my 22nd.
of course it is.  any favourite among the 22?
working with leonardo.
da vinci?
di caprio.
of course.  and is he your favourite italian film director?
mr. thacker?
yes?
have you got a moment?
ahm.  that thing i was doing tonight -- I am not doing it any more.  i told them i had to spend the evening with britain's premier equestrian journalist.
oh well, great.  perfect.  oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it is my sister's birthday -- shit -- we are meant to be having dinner.
okay -- fine.
but no, I am sure i can get out of it.
no, i mean, if it is fine with you, i'll, you know, be your date.
you will be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
if that is all right.
I am sure it is all right.  my friend max is cooking and he is acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
okay.
okay.
he is bringing a girl?
miracles do happen.
does the girl have a name?
he would not say.
christ, what is going on in there?
hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected.
he is cooking guinea fowl?
do not even ask.
hi.
hi.  good lord -- you are the spitting image of...
bella -- this is anna.
right.
max.  this is anna.
hello, anna ahm...  scott -- have some wine.
hi guys.  oh holy fuck.
hun -- this is anna.  anna -- this is honey -- she is my baby sitter.
hello, bernie.
I am sorry I am so late.  bollocksed up at work again, i fear.  millions down the drain.
bernie -- this is anna.
hello, anna.  delighted to meet you.
you have not slept with her, have you?
that is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
'no comment' means 'yes.'
no, it doesn't.
do you ever masturbate?
definitely no comment.
you see -- it means 'yes.'
so tell me anna -- what do you do?
I am an actress.
splendid.  I am actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though i have done some amateur stuff -- p.g. wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  always imagined it is a pretty tough job, though, acting. i mean the wages are a scandal, are not they?
well, they can be.
i see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they are scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. it is no life.  what sort of acting do you do?
films mainly.
oh splendid.  well done.  how is the pay in movies?  i mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
fifteen million dollars.
right.  right.  so that's... fairly good.  on the high side... have you tried the nuts?
i wonder if you could tell me where the...?
oh, it is just down the corridor on the right.
quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with anna scott?
anna scott?
yes.
the movie star?
yup.
oh god.  oh god.  oh goddy god.
what do you think of the guinea fowl?
I am a vegetarian.
oh god.
having you here, anna, firmly establishes what I have long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
shame!
I am not saying it is a bad thing, in fact, i think it is something we should take pride in.  I am going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here.
bernie.
well, obviously it is me, is not it -- i work in the city in a job i do not understand and everyone keeps getting promoted above me.  i have not had a girlfriends since... puberty and, well, the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get any chubbier, they never will.
no.  not true...
c'est la vie... we are lucky in lots of ways, but... surely it is worth a brownie.
so i get the brownie?
i think you do, yes.
wait a minute.  what about me?
I am sorry?  you think you deserve the brownie?
well... a shot at it.
you will have to prove it.  this is a great brownie and I am going to fight for it.  state your claim.
well, I have been on a diet since i was nineteen, which means basically I have been hungry for a decade.  I have had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
that was such a great evening.
I am delighted.
and may i say that is a gorgeous tie.
now you are lying.
you are right.  i told you i was bad at acting.
lovely to meet you.
and you.  I will wait till you have gone before i tell him you are a vegetarian.
no!
night, night, honey.
floppy, huh?
it is the hair!  it is to do with the hair.
why is she in a wheelchair?
it was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
and the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
you know, I am not sure.  i do not think they would tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
too complicated.
that is fine.
busy tomorrow?
i thought you were leaving.
i was.
gardens.  all these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. they are like little villages.
let's go in.
ah no -- that is the point -- they are private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
you abide by rules like that?
ahm...
whoopsidaisies.
what did you say?
nothing.
yes, you did.
no, i didn't.
you said 'whoopsidaisies.'
i do not think so.  no one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- i mean unless they're...
there is no 'unless.'  no one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
exactly.  here we go again.
it is a disease I have got -- it is a clinical thing.  I am taking pills and having injections -- it will not last long.
step aside.
bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  have you seen my glasses?
no, 'fraid not.
bollocks.  this happens every time i go to the cinema.  average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere i look, glasses.  but the moment i need them they disappear.  it is one of life's real cruelties.
that is compared to, like, earthquakes in the far east or testicular cancer?
oh shit, is that the time?  i have to go.
thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
you are welcome.  did you find them?
sort of.
so who left who?
she left me.
why?
she saw through me.
uh-oh.  that is not good.
I am sorry.
no, that is fine.  i love that you tried... time was I would have done the same.
i should not have done that.  i should not have done that.
no, you were brilliant
I am rash and I am stupid and what am i doing with you?
i do not know, I am afraid.
i do not know either.
here we are.  do you want to come up?
there seem to be lots of reasons why i shouldn't.
there are lots of reasons.  do you want to come up?
to be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
you have got to go.
why?
because my boyfriend, who i thought was in america, is in fact in the next room.
your boyfriend?
yes...
who is it?
ahm... room service.
how you doing?  i thought you guys all wore those penguin coats.
well, yes -- usually -- I would just changed to go home -- but i thought I would just deal with this final call.
oh great.  could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
I will see what i can do.
still, not sparkling.
absolutely.  ice cold still water.
unless it is illegal in the uk to serve liquids below room temperature: i do not want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
no, I am sure it will be fine.
and maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
right.
really -- do not do that -- I am sure this is not his job.
I am sorry.  is this a problem?
ah -- no.  it is fine.
what is your name?
ahm... bernie.
thank you, bernie.  hey -- nice surprise, or nasty surprise?
nice surprise.
liar.  she hates surprises.  what are you ordering?
i have not decided.
well, do not over-do it.  i do not want people saying, 'there goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend."
-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with.  to be honest, i do not realize...
I am sorry... i do not know what to say.
i think goodbye is traditional.
well, okay.  there is this girl...
aha!  I would been getting a female vibe. good.  speak on, dear friend.
she is someone i just can not -- someone who... self-evidently can not be mine -- and it is as if I have taken love-heroin -- and now i can not even have it again. I have opened pandora's box.  and there is trouble inside.
you did not know she had a boyfriend?
no -- did you?
bloody hell, i can not believe it -- my whole life ruined because i do not read 'hello' magazine.
let's face facts.  this was always a no-go situation.  anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
buggered?
every time.  but do not despair -- i think i have the solution to your problems.
really?
that is right.
and this is william.
well?
she is perfect, perfect.
i think you have forgotten...  what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who will love you -- the chances are... always miniscule.  look at me -- not counting the american -- I have only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
that is not fair.
no really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say indiana jones -- and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend.
still loves you though.
in a depressingly asexual way.
i never fancied you much actually...
i mean i loved you -- you were terribly funny.  but all that kissing my ears...
oh no -- this is just getting worse. i am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
do you want to stay?
why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating welshman.
hi.  can i come in?
come in.
i do not know where to go.  the hotel is surrounded.
this is the place.
thank you.  I am just in london for two days -- but, with your papers, it is the worse place to be.
these are such horrible pictures. they are so grainy... they make me look like...
do not think about it.  we will sort it out.  now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
a bath would be great.
I am really sorry about last time.  he just flew in -- i had no idea -- in fact, i had no idea if he would ever fly in again.
no, that is fine.  it is not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major hollywood star.  it was a thrill for me.  how is he?
i do not know.  it got to the point where i could not remember any of the reasons i loved him.  and you... and love?
well, there is a question -- without an interesting answer.
i have thought about you.
oh no no -- no.
just anytime I have tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it is been a disaster.
i appreciate that absolutely.  is that the film you are doing?
yes -- start in l.a. on tuesday.
would you like me to take you through your lines?
would you?  it is all talk, talk, talk.
hand it over.  basic plot?
I am a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
well done you.
'message from command.  would you like them to send in the hks?'
'no, turn over 4 trs's and tell them we need radar feedback before the kft's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the pentagon that we will be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and do not you dare say one word about how many mistakes i made in that speech or I will pelt you with olives.
'very well, captain -- I will pass that on straightaway.'
'thank you.'  how many mistake did i make?
eleven.
damn.  'and wainwright...'
cartwright.
'cartwright, wainwright, whatever your name is, i promised little jimmy I would be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that i may be a little late.'
'certainly.  and little johnny?'
my son's name is johnny?
yup.
well, get a message through to him too.
brilliant.  word perfect I would say.
what do you think?
gripping.  it is not jane austen, it is not henry james, but it is gripping.
you think i should do henry james instead?
I am sure you would be great in henry james. but, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
yes -- i mean -- you never get anyone in 'wings of a dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the pentagon that we need black star cover.'
and i think the book is the poorer for it.
you like chagall?
i do.  it feels like how being in love should be.  floating through a dark blue sky.
with a goat playing a violin.
yes -- happiness would not be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
i do not mention that anna's a vegetarian, did i?
i have some parsnip stew from last week. if i just peel the skin off, it will be perfect.
you have got big feet.
yes.  always have had.
you know what they say about men with big feet?
no.  what is that?
big feet -- large shoes.
the thing that is so irritating is that now I am so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
you actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
definitely.  'you may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  in the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
you have a stunt bottom?
i could have a stunt bottom, yes.
would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
definitely.  ths is important stuff.
it is one hell of a job.  what do you put on your passport?  profession -- mel gibson's bottom.
actually, mel does his own ass work. why would not he?  it is delicious.
the ice cream or mel gibson's bottom?
both.
today has ben a good day.  which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
well, thank you.  anyway -- time for bed.  or... sofa-bed.
right.
oh my god...  hello.
hello.  i wonder if i could have a little word.
spike.
i do not want to interfere, or anything ... but she is split up from her boy- friend, that is right is not it?
maybe.
and she is in your house.
yes.
and you get on very well.
yes.
well, is not this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
spike.  for god's sake -- she is in trouble -- get a grip.
right.  right.  you think it is the wrong moment.  fair enough.  do you mind if i have a go?
spike!
no -- you are right.
I will talk to you in the morning.
okay -- okay.  might be too late, but okay.
oh please sod off.
okay.
no! no.  wait.  i... thought you were someone else.  i thought you were spike. I am delighted you are not.
wow.
what?
it still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I am allowed to see you naked.
you and every person in this country.
oh god yes -- I am sorry.
what is it about men and nudity? particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
well...
no seriously.  i mean, they are just breasts.  every second person in the world has got them...
more than that actually, when you think about it.  you know, meatloaf has a very nice pair...
but... they are odd-looking.  they are for milk.  your mum's got them.  you must have seen a thousand of them -- what is the fuss about?
actually, i can not think really -- let me just have a quick look...
rita hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with gilda -- they wake up with me.' do you feel that?
who was gilda?
her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they did not like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
you are lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
oh.
can i stay a bit longer?
stay forever.
damn, i forgot the jam.
what?
do not ask.
oh my god.  and they got a photo of you dressed like that?
undressed like this, yes.
jesus.
i would not go outside.
why not?
just take my work for it.
how are you doing?
how do you think I am doing?
i do not know what happened.
i do.  your furry friend thought he would make a buck or two telling the papers where i was.
that is not true.
really?  the entire british press just woke up this morning and thought 'hey -- i know where anna scott is.  she is in that house with the blue door in notting hill.'  and then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
i went out in my goddamn underwear too.
get out, spike.  I am so sorry.
this is such a mess.  i come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I am landed in it all over again.  for god's sake, I have got a boyfriend.
you do?
as far as they are concerned i do.  and now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to timbuktu.
i know, i know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
you can stay calm -- it is the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  everyone you ever bump into will know.  'well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we have seen the pictures.'
that is spectacularly unfair.
who knows, it may even help business. buy a boring book about egypt from the guy who screwed anna scott.
now stop.  stop.  i beg you -- calm down. have a cup of tea.
i do not want a goddamn cup of tea.  i want to go home.
and remember -- spike owes you an expensive dinner.  or holiday -- depending if he is got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
that is not true.  and wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  can not we just laugh about this?  seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff does not matter.
what he is going to say next is -- there are people starving in the sudan.
well, there are.  and we do not need to go anywhere near that far.  my best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she is in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. all I am asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
you are right: of course, you are right. it is just that I have dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you have had it for ten minutes.  our perspectives are different.
i mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
excuse me?
well, you know -- it is just one day. today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
you really do not get it.  this story gets filed.  every time anyone writes anything about me -- they will dig up these photos.  newspapers last forever. I will regret this forever.
was it you?
i suppose i might have told one or two people down the pub.
right.
have we got something for you. something which will make you love me so much you will want to hug me every single day for the rest of my life.
blimey.  what is that?
the phone number of anna scott's agent in london and her agent in new york. you can ring her.  you think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
well, thanks, that is great.
it is great, is not it.  see you tonight. hey, marty-- sexy cardy.
i just want to say to tony -- do not take it personally.  the more i think about things, the more i see no rhyme or reason in life -- no one knows why some things work out, and some things do not -- why some of us get lucky -- and some of us...
... get fired.
no!
yes, they are shifting the whole outfit much more towards the trading side -- and of course...  i was total crap.
wait a minute -- I am your brother and i do not know anything about this.
is it someone we know?
by the way -- it is you.
me?
yes.  what do you think?
well, yes.  groovy.
any more announcements?
yes -- i feel i must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  i have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
there is an understatement.  there are dead people on better form.
but i wish to make it clear I have turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
so -- you have laid the ghost.
i believe i have.
do not give a damn about the famous girl.
no, do not think i do.
which means you will not be distracted by the fact that she is back in london, grasping her oscar, and to be found filming most days on hampstead heath.
oh god no.
so not over her, in fact.
can i help you?
yes -- i was looking for anna scott...
does she know you are coming?
no, no.  she doesn't.
I am afraid i can not really let you through then, sir.
oh right.  i mean, i am a friend -- I am not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
... can not let you through.
this is certainly... ah...
i only found out you were here yesterday.
i was going to ring... but... i did not think you would want to...
it is not going very well -- and it is our last day.
absolutely -- you are clearly very busy.
but... wait... there are things to say.
okay.
drink tea -- there is lots of tea.
are you a fan of henry james?
this is henry james film?
we are living in cloudcuckooland -- we will never get this done today.
we have to.  I have got to be in new york on thursday.
oh, stop showing off.
god, that is an enormous arse.
I am not listening.
no, but seriously -- it is not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed.
i said I am not listening -- and i think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
so i ask you when you are going to tell everyone, and you say...?
'tomorrow will be soon enough.'
and then i... right.
who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
oh... no one... no one.  just some... guy from the past.  i do not know what he is doing here.  bit of an awkward situation.
what is going on?
I am going to throw out these old videos.
no.  you can not bin these.  they are classics.  I am not allowing this.
right -- let's talk about rent...
let me help.  we do not want all this shit cluttering up our lives.
i have to disturb you when you are cooking the books, but there is a delivery.
martin, can not you just deal with this yourself?
but it is not for the shop.  it is for you.
okay.  tell me, would i have to pay a wet rag as much as i pay you?
hi.
hello.
you disappeared.
yes -- I am sorry -- i had to leave... i did not want to disturb you.
well... how have you been?
fine.  everything much the same.  when they change the law spike and i will marry immediately.  whereas you... I have watched in wonder.  awards, glory ...
oh no.  it is all nonsense, believe me. i had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is...  well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I am just off -- but i brought you this from home, and...
i thought I would give it to you.
thank you.  shall i...
no, do not open it yet -- I will be embarrassed.
okay -- well, thank you.  i do not know what it is for.  but thank you anyway.
i actually had it in my apartment in new york and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, i did not know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  so it is been just sitting in the hotel.  but then... you came, so i figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
what is the thing?
you were saying...
yes.  the thing is... i have to go away today but i wondered, if i didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
but yesterday... that actor asked you who i was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... i heard -- you had a microphone... i had headphones.
you expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in england?
excuse me -- it is your mother on the phone.
can you tell her I will ring her back.
i actually tried that tack -- but she said you said that before and it is been twenty-four hours, and her foot that was purple is now a sort of blackish color...
okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, martin?
can i just say, i thought 'ghost' was a wonderful film.
is that right?
yes... I have always wondered what patrick swayze is like in real life.
i can not say i know patrick all that well.
oh dear.  he was not friendly during the filming?
well, no -- I am sure he was friendly -- to demi moore -- who acted with him in 'ghost.'
sorry about that.
that is fine.  there is always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
... can i just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
... yes, that is fine.  of course.  i... you know... of course... I will just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
the truth is...
... with you, I am in real danger.  it took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, i fear, not recover if i was once again ... cast aside, which i would absolutely expect to be.  there are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films.  you would go and I would be... well, buggered, basically.
i see.  that reality is a real 'no,' is not it?
i live in notting hill.  you live in beverly hills.  everyone in the world knows who you are.  my mother has trouble remembering my name.
okay.  fine.  fine.  good decision.
what do you think?  good move?
good move: when all is said and done, she is nothing special.  i saw her taking her pants off and i definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
good decision.  all actresses are mad as snakes.
tony -- what do you think?
absolutely.  never trust a vegetarian.
great.  excellent.  thanks.
i was called and i came.  what is up?
william has just turned down anna scott.
you daft prick!
this painting is not the original, is it?
yes, i think that one may be.
but she said she wanted to go out with you?
yes -- sort of...
that is nice.
what?
well, you know, anybody saying they want to go out with you is... pretty great... is not it...
it was sort of sweet actually -- i mean, i know she is an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
if anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
and we intend to use them!
where is bella?
where are you going?
down kensington church street, then knightsbridge, then hyde park corner.
crazy.  go along bayswater...
bloody hell, this is fun.
is miss scott staying here?
no, sir.
how about miss flintstone?
no, sir.
or bambi... or, i do not know, beavis or butthead?
no, sir.
right.  right.  fair enough.  thanks.
i hoped there might be -- but no, I am assured there aren't.
and what would you say...
yes, I am pretty sure i would.
that is very good news.  the readers of 'horse and hound' will be absolutely delighted.
what happened?
it was good.
