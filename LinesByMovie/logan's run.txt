you are here. i couldn't believe it when they told me. what are you doing?
turn this way.  no, no... not you... you!
you should've seen me take my last runner... perfect.  i backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  so now you've seen him... what's the difference awake or asleep?
open your eyes once, idiot.  it's not every day that a sandman son is born. i'm telling you, francis -- that's him!
maybe, maybe not. what's the difference? come on, logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out.
break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
logan-5... francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. intrusion accidental.
clear logan-5 and francis-7.
had enough?
even the alarm didn't wake him.
you need a lift. let's go to arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... logan-6.
has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
not in my time...
why?
just wondered... what happens?
dunno... flameout maybe. whatever happens, you can bet it's final. but who would want to find out?
but you don't know, you just say what everyone says. "one for one. one for one."
well, why not!? that's exactly how everything works. how else could the city stay in balance -- you have a better idea?
no, but at least i wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. you sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  you know, logan -- you wonder a lot. too much for a sandman.
well? how do you like it?
i don't know. the cheeks maybe... look a little --
cheeks? cheeks? right. too much, you think?
too little.
too little?  too little. okay, wait for me.
did you ever see francis-8?
i never even visited nursery before tonight.  when you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?
i don't know what makes you so curious. you have any idea who his seed-mother was?
of course not! i'm curious, not sick.
you missed something special.
well... you can't have them all.
the damned yellows are getting out of hand. those three ought to be in cathedral. no business scrambling in arcade...
what an old, old man you're getting to be, francis. weren't you ever a yellow? i bet you were even wilder than --  come on, sandman.
you should have been with us in nursery, daniel. i'm positive i recognized him --
come on. i don't want to miss the filing-in. there'll be some i know tonight, i think...
now there's a few who could have been his seed-mother.
only a few? you're just not trying.
who invited you?
i'm in my party mood.
that was a great shot you made.
yes.  but you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
what's wrong, available?
please... no.
please... no?  you mean "not here" -- that's it? you're a private available but particular.  don't worry. there's no one here but me. and you.
no.  just no.
you prefer women?
no.
well then...?
nothing. i felt sad, i put myself on the circuit. it was a mistake.
sad? what made you sad?
a friend of mine went on carousel tonight. now he's gone.
yes... probably he was renewed?
he was killed.
killed? why do you use that word?
isn't it right? isn't that what you do? kill.
i never 'killed' anybody in my life. sandmen terminate runners.  who brought you?
nobody. i felt sad... i put myself on the circuit.
you felt sad. what's your name?
jessica.
you're beautiful. let's have sex.
no.
later.
no.
but you put yourself on the circuit!
i thought i had to do something.
and?
i changed my mind.
and now?
curious.
about what?
how a sandman lives.
let's have sex.  i thought you were curious.
not about that.
i'm listening.
i'm afraid to tell you.
i'm not armed.  well?
why is it wrong to run?
you shouldn't even think such things...  and you picked a strange person to say them to --
i suppose. but what if you want to live?
so? do what everyone does. try like hell for renewal.
but if you're one of the misfits... that's where i come in.
i didn't say that i would run... i just...
are you a 5 or a 6?
six. i go red next year.
you're years away... i don't know why you're thinking of these things, much less talking about them.  want to try?
what quad do you live in?
k.
you're sure you don't want to try?
i just might look in on new you 483 myself.
you? why? you're already beautiful.
no -- it's that last runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him.
what the hell took you so long?
did you ever see anybody renew?
i think you've been skulling out too much. first nursery and now stupid questions.
did you?
of course.
anybody we know?
look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than i do.
i'm fine...  see you...
at carousel tonight?
you could have called me yourself.
but i wasn't sure you'd come.
here i am.  shall i come in?
i couldn't get you out of my mind.
i'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, i suppose?
maybe... sure...
thanks... but i have the choice.
of course.
then it's still no.
you can have any woman in the city. what do you really want?
you know.
i don't believe you. there has to be more.
all right.
why show me?
i'm going to run.
why tell me?
you know something.
about running, dying what?
both... running's what i'm interested in.
i know what everyone knows. try like hell for renewal. you have the same chance everyone else has.
it's different now. help me.
how can i?
where did you get that?
a runner gave it to me.
and then you killed him, right?
i let him go... believe me.
i don't..
speak to your friends for me, jessica... please...
please? what friends?
i don't have much time.
i never heard of a sandman running... ever...
and i never heard of sanctuary.
no -- just there -- on the first level.  don't look for us. we'll see you.
you don't seem quite sure, jessica.  can you do it? will you?
are you here to help me?
what do you need?
what're you going to do?
that's tomorrow.
i wish i could help you.
maybe you'll think of something...
i wish i knew what you think i know.
if you did know, you'd tell me.
of course --
if you trusted me, you'd know.
we're coming to arcade.  shall we relive together?
a runner... cathedral. a woman.
you're not going, are you?
why not? maybe she'll help me. you won't. you'd better stay here.
i'd rather be with you.
that's nice.
they're like beasts. wild.
maybe they're angry because they're grown in meccano-breeders.
instead of what? nine months inside a woman:  we're all raised the same but most of us don't become cubs in cathedral.
some people say children need human mothering.
insane. nurseries are better than any mother could be.
i'm only telling you what i've heard...  haven't you ever wondered what your seed-mother was like...?
uh-uh.
i have.
when did you begin to question lastday?
i don't remember exactly... except i was a green.  what would you like to relive, logan?
let's see -- how long has it been?
just follow -- no matter how it seems...
but what is this -- why?
the cubs. when they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
muscle? i don't know that one.
what's your name?
i'm mary 2.
where do you live, mary?
here.
why aren't you in nursery?
i'm very smart.
when do you go up?
i never go upstairs. you're a nice old lady.
i'm a sandman!
i cut up a sandman yesterday. they said i'd never get him... but i cut him up good, i did.
i feel sorry for you, boy!
for me? better feel sorry for yourself, sandman!
no, for you! how old are you, billy?
fourteen? fifteen? your days are running out. how long can you last? a year. six months?  what happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
nothing will happen! i make the rules as i go!! cubs do what i say! always have! always will! i got cathedral and i'll never let go!
no cubs over fifteen, billy! ever heard of a cub with a green flower? you'll leave cathedral then, billy, when you're on green, because they won't let a green stay here.  if you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
shut up! shut up your damn mouth!
i'm ashamed. i was bringing you to be killed.
where? sanctuary? can you take me there?
logan, i don't know where sanctuary is. but if i take you to them, they'll kill you.
all right. but why? i didn't kill the runner.
yes, but they won't know that... or care. they're hunting you, logan. maybe me too, now...
that's nothing... there's a sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. take me to them.
i -- i can't.
then -- why don't you leave me -- go to them -- explain
no. not that either.
hello, sandman.
hello.
do you want to see doc?
we don't get many sandmen. i think we've only had one other since i've been here.
a sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. where's the doctor?
i like your face. would you mind if doc took a picture? i'd like him to give your face to somebody else.
it's all right with me. is he here?
my name's holly... holly 13. in ancient times they said my number was unlucky. do you believe in luck?
no -- look, i'm in a hurry.
it's a real privilege, sandman.
thanks.  i thought you'd be older. i expected a red.
i am.
your own work?
and i did it myself right on there.
i designed it myself.  what'll it be... a face job or a full-body job?
just the face.
fine... holly will get you ready. you're in good hands, believe me.
do you have anything special in mind?
i don't care... just get it over with.
hurry... hurry... hurry.
what's going on, logan?!
it has nothing to do with you.
what are you talking about?! i saw you let a runner go?  i saw you, logan?? tell me!!
are you taking me to them?
yes.  i don't know what else to do -- with him following us.  why do you keep running from your --
because he's my friend --  and i don't want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
he's good, isn't he?
will he find us and kill us? yes... or one of the others.  you know there's only one place to go now...
they won't believe us.
i'd rather take my chances with them... than with francis.
they won't listen.
you think sandmen will?  there's no other way for me,
we'll convince them.
exactly four steps now. let me lead you.  now to the right. it's narrow here, you'll have to get behind me.
how will they know we're coming?
they're watching us now. they'll let us in when they're sure.
it's him! the first sandman. he killed... doc.
no, holly -- wait! he's running. tell them the rest!
he's the one. you too. i remember. he was in a hurry. just a face job. dark hair, i said. then he killed doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and i ran... i ran.
holly. holly! please... the other sandman. remember the one who came after --
that's right. the other one came after. the older one. smashing, killing, burning!
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. wasn't he? wasn't he? this one was running, the other one was hunting him...
yes. oh yes.  he was after you. i remember. you're running!
i don't know who you are. i'd like to thank someone.
it doesn't matter who we are. follow the tunnel to the end.
will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
someone will follow. when you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
no. jessica goes back now. take her back.  now! go on back. back outside, jessica.
will you take me with you?
why, jessica? you're still a green.
how do we know this is the right way?
it's the only way.
what do you suppose this was...?
some kind of breeding pens... i suppose... they say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
ycch.  to kill things and then eat them. it must have been a savage world.
i'm afraid.
it's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
i don't know what's going to happen to us logan but --  are you glad you didn't kill him?
it doesn't make any difference anymore.
you're really one of us now, aren't you?
you knew that i wasn't before, didn't you?  why did you stay with me?
i wanted to...  ...and you... what made you kill sandmen?
i had to. i did kill... for the first time in my life i killed.
because you felt like a runner, didn't you.
i guess so... i know i felt something i never felt before... and i didn't like it... not a bit.  i'll tell you one thing... sanctuary better be worth it. that's the last place for me to live now.
for us.
are you too startled? am i too removed from your ken?  i'm neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either.  no human sculptor could match this greatness... don't you agree?
all right -- what are you?
your turn.
we're hungry do you have anything to eat?
anything to eat?
how do you think we got here??!!
you walked in. i saw you. don't you remember?
where do you think we came from?
from? from? from?
we were sent here and you know it. others have been sent here. where are they? hiding?
hiding? yes! hiding, hiding.
where do we go?!  where do we go from here??!!
is that the wind?  not yet...  you must hear my birds sing.
you know about sanctuary! i know you do! you have to help us! you don't have a choice! it isn't your decision!! tell us.
never a pair. i have never had a pair.
where do you send them?
you're a beautiful pair.
answer the question!
do you know how long all this will last? not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you'll be part of it. ages will roll... ages. and you'll be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
there must be somebody else up here. i can't believe that he's --
let me sculpt you and i will show you where the others have gone.
that's better.  how do you want us?
nude. imagine, a pair.
it'll be all right...
how do you want us?
up there.
all right. now you keep your bargain.
wait for the wind! wait and hear the birds sing over you!
we're ready.
how did they get in here?
regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... the other food stopped coming and they started.
what other food?
fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  it's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... and then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. so i store them here. i'm ready. and you're ready. it's my job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
what's that?
it feels like breath. it makes everything move. your hair is moving.
and yours.
i hate outside! i hate it!
we'll be all right...  we will...
don't!
sooner or later, we'll have to try something.
it's getting dark and cold. i'm tired.
why don't we rest here? we know we can eat these.
do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
i doubt it.
don't ever let go.
i won't.
it all seemed to make sense until box.
do you think he was telling the truth?
maybe we're the first ones to get through...  maybe sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. it couldn't be outside.
how would anyone know? even if we find it -- we can never go back.
you're right... it must be near now. we'll find it.
thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
what does it mean?
the lifeclocks have no power outside.
you can have any woman in the city. what do you really want?
you know, jessica.
...but i still have the choice...?
of course.
then the answer's yes...
i have never seen a face like that before. it must be the look of great age. whoever he was he was terribly old.
yes, do you think that's why he looks so sad?
they all have names and numbers on them. i wonder what they are?
"beloved husband". "beloved wife". what can all that mean?
look at his face... and his hair...  is that what it is to grow old?
it could be...
yes, cats, of course. what else could they be? cats. of course each one has his own name too.
but there are so many of them. do you know each one separately.
yes indeed, everyone. actually, they all have three.  "the naming of cats is a difficult matter. it isn't just one of your holiday games. you may think at first i'm mad as a hatter when i tell you a cat must have three different names."  an ordinary name and a fancy name. that's two. do you want to guess what the third one is?
how long have you been living here?
for as long as i can remember.
what kind of place is this?
just a place, i suppose... who knows?
how did you get here?
i have always been here...
are there any other humans?
gracious... no.
have any other people ever passed through?
but there may be a few around somewhere.
what makes you think so?
my parents thought so. mother and father. you know?
mother and -- ? you knew your mother and father?
and... and how were you grown? inside your mother?
yes...
are you sure?
mother and father said so... you know?
where are they?
dead... they're dead... and buried.
they're beautiful. may i have one too please?
no -- i'm sorry. it's not possible.
it isn't fair. i'll give you one of my favorite cats... a jellicle cat.  "jellicle cats have cheerful faces, jellicle cats have bright black eyes; they like to practice their airs and graces and wait for the jellicle moon to rise."
i'm sorry but i don't have anything to give you.
what kind of jewel is this?
i don't know.
you're both full of secrets like macavity.  did you steal this?
no.
"macavity, macavity, there's no one like macavity, there never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."
what's beyond this place -- do you know?
no, no, no
did your mother or father ever mention another place?
never, never, ever. nothing.
may we stay here for a while? we'd like to rest.
of course you can stay. this belongs to the people.
what belongs to the people?
all this. all of it.
what people?
i don't know... but it does.
that sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
he had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
one in a million, i suppose
there's a sanctuary... there is!
you want there to be one... that doesn't...
there has to be! i know it exists! it has to!!
no, there doesn't. not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who don't want to die... want it so much that a place called sanctuary becomes "real". but it doesn't exist. it never existed. just the hope.
you're wrong!! it has to be!! it just has to be!!
why did you do that??!!
i didn't do anything, francis! they've made us believe that...
why did you do that???!!!
we'll have to bury him.
what's that?
they're put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...
i'll make the arrangements.
at least it's over...
are you ready to put him in?
not yet.
all right.
of course... that's settled then. but just you remember your promise...
we'll remember. but that's a long time off...
what are we promising him? what can we possibly give him?
he asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
we can't. we're going back.
to what?
i'm going to try and tell people what we've seen and --
you're lying! you'll never have the chance to tell anybody anything! you'll be killed the moment you're seen!
do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
things won't change... you know that! we can live here together, logan... have a life as long as his... together!
things change!
you want to go back to kill, is that it?! now, you'll want to kill your own!!! kill sandmen!!! killing's all you ever...!!!
jessica... listen to me... listen to me...  the lifeclocks made me kill francis. they make people die or be killed every day. if i didn't try and destroy that... i couldn't live here or anywhere. do you understand?
i want to be alive and with you, that's all i want.
we're leaving.
what a pity. i was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
come with us.
where are you going?
to a city with thousands and thousands of people.
alive?
thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
more... many more.
and all alive you say?
is that really it? it doesn't seem very far. will we be there soon?
i promise. we'll go on as soon as it's light.
that's better than gold when it's cold.
thank you.  tell me -- what do those words mean? "beloved husband"... "beloved son"... "beloved wife"...
my father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
stay? they lived together all their years?
oh, yes... i think...
"beloved son"...  so people stayed together for that feeling of love... they would live and raise children together and be remembered.  i think i feel that way, logan. can we be that way?
yes. you and i, jessica.
and sanctuary?
sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. but nothing less, either...
beloved husband...
beloved wife...
what does that water do?
it's part of the hydrogalvanic system. the ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
is it inside the city?
of course.  i don't know where...  i just took them for granted.  it's our only chance.
i know...  we're going to try and get in this way. i don't think you can make it.
oh... i did so look forward to seeing all those people.
i'm sorry.
yes...
can you make it back?
oh my... i'll try.
goodbye.
oh, my...
