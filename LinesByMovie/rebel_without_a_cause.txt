judy--we're ready for you now.
he hates me.
what?
he hates me.
what makes you think he hates you, judy?
i do not think.  i know.  he looks at me like I am the ugliest thing in the world.  he does not like my friends--he--
he makes you feel pretty unhappy?
he calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
do you think your father means that?
yes!  i do not know!  i mean maybe he does not mean it but he acts like he does.  we are altogether and we are going to celebrate easter and catch a double bill.  big deal.  so i put on my new dress and i came out and he--
that one?
yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  he grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till i thought i would not have any lips left.  and all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing i told you he called me.  then i ran out of the house.
is that why you were wandering around at one of the clock in the morning?
i was just talking a walk.  i tried to call the kids but everybody was out and i could not find them.  i hate my life.  i just hate it.
you were not looking for company, were you?
no.
did you stop to talk to anyone, judy?  do you enjoy that?
no.  i do not even know why i do it.
do you think you can get back at your dad that way?  i mean sometimes if we can not get as close to somebody as we would like we have to try making them jealous--so they will have to pay attention.  did you ever think of that?
I will never get close to anybody.
some kids stomped a man on twelfth street, judy.
you know where they picked me up! twelfth street!  i was not even near there!
would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  did you notify the parents?
hey!  that is enough static out of you.
want me to imitate a stupid cop?
cut it out now.  I am warning you.
yes, ma'am.
your mother will be down in a few minutes, judy--
what?
your mother will be down in a few minutes.
my mother?
she is being called for.
you said you would call my father.
goodbye, judy.  take it easy.
john crawford?
yes, sir.
come with me, john.
do you know why you shot those puppies, john?  is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
plato.
can you tell me why you killed the puppies, plato?
no, sir.  i just went next door to look at them like i always do. they were nursing on their mother and i did it.  i guess I am just no good?
what do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
i do not know.  end up in the electric chair?
where did you get the gun?
in my mother's drawer.
she keep it to protect herself, sir. she scared without a man in the house.
where is your mother tonight, plato?
they not together, sir.  we do not see him in a long time now.
do you hear from him, son?
you know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
head-shrinker?
oh, mrs. crawford do not believe in them!
well maybe she better start.
i do not see what is so bad about taking a little drink.
you don't?
no.  i definitely don't.  i did the sa--
he is a minor, mr. stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
say, listen--
i guess i cut pretty loose in my day too.
really, frank?  when was that?
listen--can't you wait till we get home?
whoa!  whoa!  i know you are a little upset but--
sorry.
what about you, jim?  got anything to say for yourself?
can not you answer?  what is the matter with you anyhow?
he is just loaded, honey.
i was talking to jim.
let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  the kid has no friends yet and--
tell him why we moved here.
hold it, jim.
you can not protect me.
you mind if i try?  you have to slam the door in my face?  i try to get to him--what happens?  do not i give you everything you want?  a bicycle--you get a bicycle. a car--
you buy me many things.  thank you.
not just buy!  you hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  we give you love and affection, do not we?
was it because we went to that party?  you know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it is no place for kids.
a minute ago you said you did not care if he drinks.
what?
stop tearing me apart!  you say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
that is a fine way to behave!
excuse us a minute?
sure.  sure.
someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
grandma?
get lost.
hang loose, boy.  I am warning you.
wash up and go home.
big tough character.  you do not kid me, pal.  how come you are not wearing your boots?
too bad you did not connect.  you could have gone to juvenile hall. that is what you want, is not it?
no.
sure it is.  you want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  why?
leave me alone.
no.
i do not know why--!
go on--don't give me that.  someone giving you hard looks?
i just get so--  boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. ray  okay.  okay.  let it out.
you feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
all the time!  i do not know what gets into me--but i keep looking for trouble and i always--i swear you better lock me up.  I am going to smash somebody--i know it.
try the desk.
that why you moved from the last town? 'cause you were in trouble? you can talk about it if you want to--i know about it anyway. routine check.
and they think they are protecting my by moving.
you were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. why did you do it?
mess that kid up?
he called me chicken.
and your folks did not understand?
they never do.
so then you moved?
they think I will make friends if we move.  just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
but you do not think that is a solution.
things pretty tough for you at home?
she eats him alive and he takes it.
what a zoo!
what?
a zoo.  he always wants to be my pal, you know?  but how can i give him anything when he's--i mean i love him and i do not want to hurt him--but i do not know what to do anymore except maybe die.
pretty mixed up?
if he could--
"if he could" what?  you mean your father?
i mean if he had the guts to knock mom cold once i bet she would be happy and i bet she would stop picking.  they make mush out of him.  just mush. one thing i know is i never want to be like him.
chicken?
i bet you see right through me, do not you?
how can anyone grow up in this circus?
you got me, jim--but they do.  want some water?
boy--if i had one day when i did not have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or i felt i belonged some place.
here.  look, will you do something for me?  if the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  it is easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
okay--
any time--day or night.  you calmed down enough to go back now?
you serious?
I am sorry.
all right, darling.
luck, jim.  do not forget.
have some cigars.
no thanks, i do not smoke.
go on--give 'em to your friends.
no--thanks, very much, mr. stark.
sit down and eat--you'll be late.
it would stick in my throat, mom.  I am nervous or something--
mother--
you make any sandwiches?
my first day of school, mother'd make me eat and by golly i could never even swallow till recess--
'bye, mom.
goodbye, dear.
so long, young fella.  knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
sure--  you know something?  i have a feeling we are going to stay here.
and listen--watch out about the pals you choose--know what i mean? do not let them choose you--
hi.  i saw you before.
bully for you.
you do not have to be unfriendly.
now that is true!
see?
"life is crushing in on me."
"life can be beautiful." hey, i know where it was.
where what was.
where i saw you.  everything going okay now?  you live around here?
who lives?
see, I am new.
will not mother be proud.
you are really flipped--aren't you.
where is dawson high school?
you going there?
yeah--why--
dig the square wardrobe!
yeah.  so where is the high school?
university and 10th--want to carry my books?
the kids take me.
oh.
I will bet you are a real yo yo.
a what?
goodbye!  see you!
I am not so bad.
steady marlon!
wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
what is that?
a new disease.
friend of yours?
I am glad they let you out.
nobody chickened.
i heard about it.  you are lucky he lived.
they always live.
hi.
hi there.
you remember me?
no.  i do not think so--
I am sorry--i made a mistake.
boy!
what?
once you been up there, you know you been some place!
you should not monkey with him.
what?
he is a wheel.  so's she.  it is hard to make friends with them.
i do not want to make friends.
what is your name!
jim.  what is yours?
plato.  it is a nickname.
listen, i told you not to fool with them.  now they are waiting for you.
i know.  that is why i came back.
you scared?
i just do not want trouble.
he has a knife.
i saw it.  gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  do you think it never stops?
no.  it is perpetual motion.
oh, i bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  go- go-go!
I am here.
they are still there!
jim--do you think when the end of the world comes it will be at night?
no.  in the morning.
you know something?
what?
you watch too much television.
hey, he is real abstract and different.
I am cute, too.
meaning me?
what?
chicken?
i thought only punks fought with knives.
who is fighting?  this is the test, man.  it is a crazy game.
machismo?
somebody find him a knife.
you satisfied or you want more?
how 'bout you?  say the word and you are cold, jack--you're dead.
buzzie--we better get out of here.
what is eating you, judy?  you want him alive?
where can we meet?
know the millertown bluff?
are you really going to meet them?
who knows.  plato?
what?
what is a chickie-run?
you thought i was mom?
yeah!
it is just this get-up.  the girl's out and i was bringing mom's supper.
and you dropped it?
yeah!  shh!
that is funny!
i better clean this up before she sees it.
how did you know that?
we used to sing it in school.  do not look at me with such horror. they had schools in those days.
but the same song.  i think it is fantastic!
we were romantic then too--
are you and mom home tonight?
no.  why?
nothing, only it would be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
with us old creeps?  come on, we have to eat.
daddy--
good evening.
hi.
did not you forget something?
what?
you are too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  i thought you stopped doing that long ago.
i did not want to stop.
i was talking to dad.
i did not kiss her so it is a big thing.
i guess i just do not understand anything.
I am tired, judy.  I would like to change the subject.
why?
I would like to, that is all.  girls your age do not do that.  you need an explanation?
girls do not love their father? since when?  since i got to be sixteen?
you awake?
yes.
listen--i took a steak out of the freezer.  i thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
I am not hungry.
hey--i want to ask you something.
shoot, jimbo.
suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  would you do it?
is there some kind of trick answer?
what would you do, dad?
i would not do anything hasty. let's get a little light on the subject.
blood.
how did that happen!  what kind of trouble you in?
the kind we have been talking about. can you answer me now?
listen--nobody should make a snap decision--this is not something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
we do not have time.
we will make time.  where is some paper.  we will make a list and if we are still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
what can you do when you have to be a man?
well, now--
just give me a direct answer!  you going to stop me from going, dad?
you know i never stop you from anything.  believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  in ten years you will look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
ten years?  now, dad--i need an answer now!
i just want to show you how foolish you are.  when you are older you will laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
how did you get here?
i hitched.
boy, i bet you would go to a hanging.
my personality's showing again. should i leave?
no.  it is okay.
just him.
stay there.
what you say your name was?
jim stark.
buzz gundersen.
hi.
glad to meet you.
sure.  it is fine.
okay.
is he your friend?
yes.  my best friend.
what is he like?
oh, i do not know.  you have to get to know him.  he does not say much but when he does you know he means it.  he is sincere.
well, that is the main thing--don't you think so?
maybe next summer he is going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  i want him to teach me how and i bet he will not get mad if i goof.  his name's jim.  it is really james but he likes jim more.  people he really likes--he lets call him "jamie."
want to finish my hamburger?  i only took a bite.
okay.
this is the edge, boy.  this is the end.
yeah.
i like you, you know?
buzz?  what are we doing this for?
we got to do something.  do not we?
feel okay?
give me some dirt.
what is happening?
good luck, buzz.
i got to go in.  you better get home too.  hey--what?
why do not you come home with me?  i mean nobody's home at my house--and I am not tired, are you?  i do not have many--people i can talk to.
who has?
if you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
hey...you flipped--or something? you better take off...
o.k.  g'night.  i got to pick up my scooter.  see you tomorrow.
yeah.
what happened, darling.  we were so worried.  i was going to take a sleeping pill, but i would not till i knew you were home.
i have to talk to someone, mom.  i have to talk to you both.  and dad this time you got to give me an answer.
go ahead.
I am in terrible trouble.--you know that big high bluff near miller- town junction?
sure--there was a bad accident there.  they showed the pictures on t.v.
i was in it.
how!
it does not matter how.  i was driving a stolen car--
do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
mom--i'm not--
and you wanted him to make a list!
will you let him tell it!
she never wants to hear.  she does not care!
i guess when i nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much i do not care!
just relax, please relax!
i told you dad, it was a question of honor.  they called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  i had to go or i would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  so i got in one of these cars and a boy called buzz got in the other.  we had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  i got out okay but buzz didn't.  he was killed.
good lord!
i can not keep it to myself anymore--
well, just get it off your chest, son.
that is not what i mean.  I have never done anything right.  I have been going around with my head in a sling for years...i do not want to drag you into this but i can not help it.  i do not think i can prove anything by going around pretending I am tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
you are absolutely right!
are you listening to me?  you are involved in this!  i want to go to the police and tell them i was mixed up in this thing tonight?
you what?
no!
did anyone see you there?  i mean did they get your license number or anything?
i do not think so--
well--
what about the other boys--do you think they will go to the police?
what is that got to do with it?
why should you be the only one.
look jim.  far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
are you going to preach now?  are we going to have a sermon?
I am just explaining what you mean! you can not be an idealist all your life!  nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
that is right!
except yourself!
will you wait a minute?
you do not want me to go.
no!  i do not want you to go to the police!  there were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
but i am involved!  we are all involved, mom!  a boy was killed! i do not see how we can get out of that by pretending it did not happen!
you know you did wrong.  that is the main thing, is not it?
no!  it is nothing!  just nothing! you always told me to tell the truth.  you think you can just turn that off?
he is not saying that!  he is saying do not volunteer!
just tell a little white lie?
you will learn as you get a little older, jim.
i do not want to learn that!
well, it does not matter anyhow-- because we are moving.
no!  you are not tearing me loose any more.
do i have to spell it out?
you are not going to use me as an excuse again, mom.  every time you can not face yourself you want to move and you say it is because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  now i want to do one thing right and I am not letting you run away.  dad?
son--this is all happening so fast--
you better give me something, dad. you better give me something  mom?
jimmy, you are very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
what is he going to pull--
nothing, crunch.  they picked him up like the rest of--
you see any cops?
you see any cops?
no--
he is going to cheese, i tell you. nobody arrested him!
i think i should go home.
no.  we are going to bring him down.
crunch--my father's--you going to kill him?
you clean out of your head?  come on!
excuse me--but--you know where i can find--i mean i do not remember his last name--
look--can't you see I am writing?
i think his first name's ray--i have to see him.  it is very important.
what is the charge?
assault with a deadly weapon.
listen--
he is not here.  he is not at juvenile hall.  i do not know where he is.  he is out on a call and he will be out all night.  how old are you?
my parents know I am out.  they know I am here.
come back tomorrow.
I will wait for him.
why do not you come back tomorrow, son?  ever been booked before?
they will be looking for you.
they saw where i jumped!  i did not chicken!  what do i have to do-- kill myself?
it does not matter to them.
you were looking for me, were not you?
no--i was just--maybe--
i tried to call you before. judy i thought so.
you still pretty upset?
I am numb.
you cold?
even if I am near a fire, I am cold. i guess just about everybody's cold.
i swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  judy, what am i going to do?  i can not go home again.
neither can i.
no?  why not?  you know something?  sometimes i figure I will never live to see my next birthday.  is not that dumb?
no.
every day i look in the mirror and say, "what?  you still here?" man!
like even today.  i woke up this morning, you know?  and the sun was shining and everything was nice. then the first thing that happens is i see you and i thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you will be nothing.
I am sorry i treated you mean today. you should not believe what i say when I am with the kids.  nobody acts sincere.
why did you get mixed up with them? you do not have to prove anything.
if you knew me you would not say that.
i do not think you trust anybody, do you?
why?
I am getting that way, too.
have you ever gone with anyone who--
sure.  lots of times.
so have i.  but I have never been in love.  is not that awful?
awful?  no.  it is just lonely. it is the loneliest time.
why did you do that?
i felt like it.
your lips are soft when you kiss.
where you going?
i do not know, but we can not stay here.
where can we go?  i can not go back into that zoo.
I am never going back.
listen!  i know a place!  plato showed me before.  an old deserted mansion near the planetarium  would you go with me?
you can trust me, judy.
i feel as if I am walking under water.
frank?  I am frightened.
what is that pounding?
i do not know.  first i thought it was jim but--
he is home.  i heard the car.
are you going down there?
look--just relax, will you?
see?  it stopped.
i still think you should go down.
who is there?  anyone there?
open it.
is he there?
no, honey.  no, he is not here.
jim!
who is that!
it is me!
how did you find me?  what is happening?
they are looking for you!--
yeah?
everybody!  crunch and goon and everybody!  i think they are going to kill you.
we know.
they think you told the police on them.  they--who's in there?
judy.
help me in!
hey where did you go?
I am here.  shut up.
come out come out wherever you are!
shut up.  are you nuts?
no.  I am scared.
we are safe here.  i hope.  what do you think?
wow!  well now-there-then!
is not it crazy?
wowee ow wow!  let's take it for the summer.
oh, jim!
no--come on.  should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
you decide, darling.  remember our budget.
do not give it a thought.  only three million dollars a month!
oh, we can manage that!  I will scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
why do not we just rent it for the season?
you see, we have just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I am so embarrassed i could die!
well--we're newlyweds.
there is just one thing.  what about--
children?  well, we really do not encourage them.  they are so noisy and troublesome, do not you agree?
yes.  and so terribly annoying when they cry.  i just do not know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
of course.  drown them like puppies.
see, we are very modern.
shall i show you the nursery?  it is far away from the rest of the house. if you have children--oh i hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you will never even notice.  in fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
talk to them!  heavens!
nobody talks to children!  they just tell them one thing and mean another.
it is wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  you know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
what?
there is only one key.
we will take it!
come on!
what time is it?
hang loose.  we got all night.
that maid saw us.  she could identify us too.
you still want to go home, moose?
no.
then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
let's see how long we can stay under.
man, you are schizoid!
I am what?  what?
you can not talk underwater!
i bet you hear everything i say!
is not he schizoid?
hey!  how 'bout that!
have not you noticed your personality splitting?
not lately.
how do you know so much about this junk, plato?
i had to go to a head-shrinker.  i only went twice though.  my mother said it cost too much, so she went to hawaii instead.
i came here before.
when was that?
when i was here?  when i ran away. i used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
who?
mom and dad.  i used to be in my crib and I would listen to them fight.
you remember that far back?  boy, i can not even remember yesterday.
plato, where is your father now?
he is dead.  he was a hero in the china sea. jim you told me he is a big wheel in new york!
i did?  well, he might as well be dead.  what is the difference?
it is all right.
ever been in a place like this before?
not exactly.  it is certainly huge.
how many rooms do you think there are?
i do not know.
should we explore?
want to read any books?  take your pick!  is not this the craziest?
hi.
hi.
what?
your hand's all wet and it is shaky.  you are so funny.
why?
i do not know--you just are. leaving a light for plato.  that was nice.
maybe he is scared of the dark.
are you?
here we are-- out of cigarettes-- junior's in the nurs'ry-- see how late it gets--
you do not need to do that.
there is something i should tell you, judy.
i know already.  we do not have to pretend now.
what a relief!
is this what it is like to love somebody?
you disappointed?
funny jimmy.  you are so clean and you--this is silly.
what?
you smell like baby powder.
so do you.
i never felt so clean before.
it is not going to be lonely, judy. not for you and not for me.
i love somebody.  all the time I have been looking for someone to love me and now--i love somebody.  and it is so easy.  why is it easy now?
it is for me too.
i love you, jim.  i really mean it.
what you run out on me for!  what you leave me alone for?
plato!
i do not want you for my father!
your father!
you crazy nut!  you crazy, crazy nut!
get away from me!
plato!
just walk over here quietly now-- and there will not be any trouble.
no!
we have to go back!
no!  i got to find him.
after he tried to shoot you?
he did not mean it--we should not have left him.  he needed us.
he needed you, maybe.  so do i.
you should have heard him talk about you tonight.  like you were the hero in the china seas.
sure.  he was trying to make us his family.
they are killing him!
we heard firing.  he get anybody? you alone?
we got a cookaboo inside.  he wounded some kid earlier.
how did he get in?
smashed the front door.
any other entrance?
down in back.
frank!
stay here.  that was my son!
you sure?
i think i know my son.
plato?
I am here.
boy, I am blind as a bat!  you got a match?  I am going to break my neck in here.  where are you?
I have got a gun.
i know.  light a match, will you?
that is swell.  how are you?
I am fine.
you think the end of the world will come at nighttime, jim?
no.  at dawn.
why?
i just have a feeling.  where are you?
here.
well, stop hiding and stand up.  i can not talk to you if i do not see you.
I am not going to hurt you. plato why did you run out on me?
we did not run out.  we were coming right back.
you sure?
sure I am sure.  judy's waiting. you ready to come out now?
no.
i promise nothing'll happen if you do.  you want my jacket?  it is warm.
can i keep it?
what do you think?
you want to give me your gun now, plato?
my gun?
in your pocket.  give it to me.
i need it.
you trust me, do not you?  just give it to me for a second.
you promised to give it back.
friends never break promises, do they?  okay.  here.  now listen.  there are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  you understand that?  they said i could come in and bring you out.
why?
they like you.  okay?
come on!
hi, plato!
hi.
who is that?
just a guard.
i shot at one of them.
but you did not hurt anybody.
those are not my friends.  make them go away.
ray!  will you tell these guys to move back?
