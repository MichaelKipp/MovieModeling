stand still, miss jenny!
there! what's so hard about that!
where's your mom?
out shopping -- you're bleeding, dad --
listen to me john.
here they come.
dad, you're bleeding...
listen to me son. you got to swear. swear means promise. first swear you'll take care of little pearl. guard her with your life, boy. then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. not even your mom.
yes, dad.
you understand?
not even her?
you got common sense. she ain't. when you grow up that money'll be yours. now swear. "i will guard pearl with my life..."
i will guard pearl with my life...
..."and i won't never tell about the money."
and i won't never tell about the money.
you, pearl. you swear too.
who's them blue men yonder?
blue men.
ben, i'm a man of god.
tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
no, ben.
what'd i say?  what? what? what? what?
you was quotin' scripture. you said -- you said, "and a little child shall lead them."
hm!
you killed two men, ben harper.
that's right, preacher. i robbed that bank because i got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and i promised myself i'd never see the day when my youngins'd want.
with that ten thousand dollars i could build a tabernacle that'd make the wheeling island tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
would you have free candy for the kids, preacher?
think of it, ben! with that cursed, bloodied gold!
how come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, preacher?
i come not with peace but with a sword.
you, preacher?
that sword has served me through many an evil time, ben harper.
what religion do you profess, preacher?
the religion the almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
i'll bet.
salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
keep talkin', preacher.
if you was to let that money serve the lord's purposes, he might feel kindly turned towards you.
keep talkin', preacher.
any trouble?
no.
he was a cool one, that harper. never broke.
he carried on some; kicked.
he never told about the money.
no.
what do you figure he done with it?
he took the secret with him when i dropped him.
hing, hang, hung.
you better not sing that song.
why?
'cause you're too little.
willa harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: no woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! the lord meant that job for two!
icey, i don't want a husband.
fiddlesticks!
tell me a story, john.
once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in africa. well, one day this king got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
the blue men?
just a man.  goodnight pearl, sleep tight; and don't let the bedbugs bite.
'night miss jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
she don't put in at cresap's landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. come on in and have a cup of coffee.
ain't nobody stole dad's skiff.
ain't nobody goin' to neither, long as uncle birdie's around.
ain't seen you in a coon's age, johnny.
i been mindin' pearl.
pshaw now! ain't it a caution what women'll load onto a feller's back when he ain't lookin'?
it's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
so you ain't with the state no more?
i must wend my way down river on the lord's work.
you ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
john: take that look offen your face and act nice.
he don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  do you, boy? ah, many's the time poor brother ben told me about these youngins.
why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
is that all?
my, that fudge smells yummy!
it's for the pick-nick. and you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
that feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
it's awful soon after ben's passing.
if ever i saw a sign from heaven!
john don't like him much.
pearl dotes on him.
the boy worries me. it's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his dad.
what he needs is a dose o' salts!
there's something else.
what?
the money, icey.
i declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, willa harper!
i would love to be satisfied harry powell don't think i've got that money somewhere.
you'll come right out and ask that man of god!  mr. paow-well!  clear that evil mud out of your soul!
you go set down by the river.
oh, icey, i'm a sight!
get along with you.
john, mr. powell has got something to tell you.
well, john, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.
john...
sshhh...
'twas down at cresap's landing, along the river shore, birdie steptoe was a pilot in the good old days of yore. now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
when'll dad's skiff be ready?
can't hear ye, boy.  ...so the big boats heave a sigh, they blow for uncle birdie...
when'll the skiff be ready?
and the times that are gone by. i'll have her ready inside of a week; and then we'll go fishin'. how's your maw?
o, she's all right.
how's your sister pearl?
just fine.
leavin', boy?
yep; gotta watch out for pearl, uncle birdie.
well goodnight, boy. come again -- any time.
did you hear what i said, son?
huh?
married! we have decided to go to sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
you ain't my dad! you won't never be my dad!
-- and when we come back, we'll all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, john!
you think you can make me tell! but i won't! i won't! i won't!
tell me what, boy?
nothin'!
are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
no. no.
now can i tell?
hm?
when mr. powell's our daddy then i can tell him about --
you swore, pearl!
john! don't!
you promised dad you wouldn't never tell!
harry!
i was praying.
oh, i'm sorry, harry! i didn't know! i thought maybe --
you thought, willa, that the moment you walked in that door i'd start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. ain't that right, now?
no, harry! i thought --
i think it's time we got one thing perfectly clear, willa. marriage to me represents a blending of two spirits in the sight of heaven.
get up, willa.
harry, what --
get up.
do you want more children, willa?
i -- no, i --
it's the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
yes.
aaa-menn!
you have all sinned!
yes! yes!
but which one of you can say as i can say: i drove a good man to murder because i kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
and the lord told that man --
yes! yes!
the lord said, take that money and throw it in the river!
yes! yes! hallelujah!
throw that money in the river! in the river!
in the riiv-er!
you'll get awful mad, john. i done a sin!
you what?
pearl! you ain't --
john, don't be mad! don't be mad! i was just playing with it! i didn't tell no one!
it's all here.
pearl! oh, pearl!
what are you doing, boy?
getting pearl to bed. i --
what's taking you so long about it?
it -- she --
what's that you're playing with, boy?
pearl's junk. mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
come on, children!
your mother says you tattled on me, boy. she says you told her that i asked you where that money was hid.
yes. yes.
that wasn't very nice of you, john. have a heart, boy.
here's your can o' hooks, uncle birdie.
there hain't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook mister gar. what a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair.
won't he bust it, uncle birdie?
shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
do you mind me cussin', boy?
no.
tell you why i ask -- your step-pa being' a preacher an' all...
can we eat him, uncle birdie?
if you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
she thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
i don't know nothin'!
the summer is young yet, little lad.  pearl?
john's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
mm-hm.
i'll tell you a secret.
yes?
i knowed your daddy.  and do you know what your daddy said to me? he said, "tell my little girl pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
yes?
now it's your turn.
what secret shall i tell?
how old are you?
that's no secret. i'm five.
sure, that's no secret.
what's your name?
you're just foolin'! my name's pearl.
tst-tst! then i reckon i'll have to try again! where's the money hid?
you see? we can't have anything to do with john.  you and me will go down to the parlor.
miz jenny! miz jenny!
that boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
it's a shame!
plan on a longer visit next time.
you don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.
yes; john's bad.
tell me another secret about my dad.
o no! your turn!
all right.
where's the money hid.
john's bad.
where's the money hid? tell me, you little wretch, or i'll tear your arm off!
icey, i'm worried about willa.
how do you mean?
i'm figurin' how i can say it so's you won't get mad.
say what, walt spoon!
there's somethin' wrong about it, mother.
about what!
about mr. powell. all of it!
walt!
now, mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
may the lord have mercy on you, walt spoon!
mother, i only --
are you through praying?
i'm through, harry.
you were listening outside the parlor window.
it's not in the river, is it harry?
answer me!
ben never told you he throwed it in the river? did he?
what's wrong, mother?
sshhh! he's in there.
who?
mr. powell!  willa has run away!
i'll be switched!...
just went?
she took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old model-t --
is he hit pretty bad?
all to pieces!
there's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
a man of the cloth?
what can we do, mother?
i thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
mister powell?
a strange woman is a narrow pit!
amen! amen!
she lieth in wait as for a prey. and increaseth the transgressors among men.
my dear, dear friends! whatever would i do without you!
mister powell!
is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
it is my shame -- my crown of thorns. and i must wear it bravely.
what could have possessed that girl!
satan.
ah.
didn't you have no inkling?
yes; from the first night.
the first night?
our honeymoon.
how's that?
she turned me out of the bed.
what do you figure to do?
do? why stay and take care of them little kids. maybe it was never meant for a woman like willa to taint their young lives.
that's mighty brave of you, reverend.
i reckon it's been ordained this way, brother spoon.
didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
a scrawl. on a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
i burned it.  i tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
amen.
the pitcher has went to the well once too often, my friends.
she'll come draggin' her tail back home.
she'll not be back. i reckon i'd be safe in promisin' you that.
maybe she's just run off on a spree.
ain't no sense in it, neither. i figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
how?
she tarried around the kitchen after i'd gone up, and when i went downstairs to see what was wrong...
what!
she'd found this fruit jar of dandelion wine  that the husband -- harper -- had hid somewheres in the cellar.  she was drinking.
i tried to save her.
i know you did, reverend. oh, i know how you tried!
the devil wins sometimes!
where's mom?
she's gone to moundsville.
to see dad?
yes, i reckon that's it.
someone is after us, pearl.
i want to go upstairs. it's cold and spidery down here. i'm hungry.
now listen to me, pearl. you and me is runnin' off tonight.
why?
if we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
won't daddy powell take care of us?
no, that's just it. no.
where are we goin', john?
somewheres. i don't know yet.
i'm hungry, john.
we'll steal somethin' to eat.
it'll spoil our supper.
just look at you! dust and filth from top to toe!
want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
thank you, no. thank you, dear icey. i'll tend to them. thank you.
i'm hungry.
why, sure. and there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
can i have my supper please?
naturally.
can i have milk too?
yes. but first of all we'll have a little talk.
about our secrets.
no.
why, pray tell?
because john said i mustn't.
just tell me now; where's the money hid?
but i swore. i promised john i wouldn't tell.
john -- doesn't -- matter! can't i get that through your head, you poor, silly, disgusting little wretch!
now! where's it hid, honey?
i'll tell.
i thought i told you to keep your mouth shut --
no, -- it ain't fair to make pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. i'll tell.
all right boy: where's the money?
in the cellar. buried under a stone in the floor.
all right...  come along.
what?
go ahead of me -- the both of you.
you don't reckon i'd leave you.
don't you believe me?
why sure, boy, sure.
now where, boy? mind; no tricks. i can't abide liars.
yonder.
now: where?
under the stone in the floor.
pearl, shut up! pearl, you swore!
you could save him, little bird.
john?
hush, pearl. come on.
uncle birdie!
don't!
hide us uncle birdie! he's a-comin' with his knife!
please be quiet -- oh please, pearl!
john, where are we g --
hush.
get in the skiff, pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
that's daddy!
dear walt and icey: i bet you been worried and gave us up for lost. took the kids down here with me for a visit to my sister elsie's farm. thot a little change of scenery would do us all a world of good after so much trubble and heartache. at least the kids will git a plenty of good home cooking. your devoted harry powell
now ain't you relieved, walt?
sure, but you was worried too, mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. i even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
you and your gypsies! they been gone a week!
not before one of 'em knifed a farmer and stole his horse. never caught the gypsies nor the horse.
are we goin' home, john?
ssh...

i'm butcherin' my hog myself, smokin' the hams, and cannin' the sausage.  you-all have your work cut out!
she talks to herself.

surely. i'd like to talk to you, my dear.
will you buy me a choclit sody?
o' course.
why, you're the purtiest girl i've seen in all my wandering. didn't nobody never tell you that, ruby?
no. no one never did.

she took them kids with her?
heaven only knows what unholy sights and sounds those innocent little babes has heard in the dens of perdition where she dragged them!

pearl! you ain't --
john, don't be mad! don't be mad! i was just playing with it! i didn't tell no one!
it's all here.
pearl! oh, pearl!
what are you doing, boy?
getting pearl to bed. i --
what's taking you so long about it?
it -- she --
what's that you're playing with, boy?
pearl's junk. mom gets mad when she plays out here and don't clean up afterward.
come on, children!
your mother says you tattled on me, boy. she says you told her that i asked you where that money was hid.
yes. yes.
that wasn't very nice of you, john. have a heart, boy.
here's your can o' hooks, uncle birdie.
there hain't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook mister gar. what a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair.
won't he bust it, uncle birdie?
shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
do you mind me cussin', boy?
no.
tell you why i ask -- your step-pa being' a preacher an' all...
can we eat him, uncle birdie?
if you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
she thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, don't we, boy?
i don't know nothin'!
the summer is young yet, little lad.  pearl?
john's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
mm-hm.
i'll tell you a secret.
yes?
i knowed your daddy.  and do you know what your daddy said to me? he said, "tell my little girl pearl there's to be no secrets between her and you."
yes?
now it's your turn.
what secret shall i tell?
how old are you?
that's no secret. i'm five.
sure, that's no secret.
what's your name?
you're just foolin'! my name's pearl.
tst-tst! then i reckon i'll have to try again! where's the money hid?
you see? we can't have anything to do with john.  you and me will go down to the parlor.
miz jenny! miz jenny!
that boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
it's a shame!
plan on a longer visit next time.
you don't hardly get settled till you're frettin' to git home again.
yes; john's bad.
tell me another secret about my dad.
o no! your turn!
all right.
where's the money hid.
john's bad.
where's the money hid? tell me, you little wretch, or i'll tear your arm off!
icey, i'm worried about willa.
how do you mean?
i'm figurin' how i can say it so's you won't get mad.
say what, walt spoon!
there's somethin' wrong about it, mother.
about what!
about mr. powell. all of it!
walt!
now, mother, a body can't help their feelin's.
may the lord have mercy on you, walt spoon!
mother, i only --
are you through praying?
i'm through, harry.
you were listening outside the parlor window.
it's not in the river, is it harry?
answer me!
ben never told you he throwed it in the river? did he?
what's wrong, mother?
sshhh! he's in there.
who?
mr. powell!  willa has run away!
i'll be switched!...
just went?
she took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old model-t --
is he hit pretty bad?
all to pieces!
there's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
a man of the cloth?
what can we do, mother?
i thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
mister powell?
a strange woman is a narrow pit!
amen! amen!
she lieth in wait as for a prey. and increaseth the transgressors among men.
my dear, dear friends! whatever would i do without you!
mister powell!
is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
it is my shame -- my crown of thorns. and i must wear it bravely.
what could have possessed that girl!
satan.
ah.
didn't you have no inkling?
yes; from the first night.
the first night?
our honeymoon.
how's that?
she turned me out of the bed.
what do you figure to do?
do? why stay and take care of them little kids. maybe it was never meant for a woman like willa to taint their young lives.
that's mighty brave of you, reverend.
i reckon it's been ordained this way, brother spoon.
didn't -- didn't she leave no word?
a scrawl. on a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
i burned it.  i tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
amen.
the pitcher has went to the well once too often, my friends.
she'll come draggin' her tail back home.
she'll not be back. i reckon i'd be safe in promisin' you that.
maybe she's just run off on a spree.
ain't no sense in it, neither. i figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
how?
she tarried around the kitchen after i'd gone up, and when i went downstairs to see what was wrong...
what!
she'd found this fruit jar of dandelion wine  that the husband -- harper -- had hid somewheres in the cellar.  she was drinking.
i tried to save her.
i know you did, reverend. oh, i know how you tried!
the devil wins sometimes!
where's mom?
she's gone to moundsville.
to see dad?
yes, i reckon that's it.
someone is after us, pearl.
i want to go upstairs. it's cold and spidery down here. i'm hungry.
now listen to me, pearl. you and me is runnin' off tonight.
why?
if we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
won't daddy powell take care of us?
no, that's just it. no.
where are we goin', john?
somewheres. i don't know yet.
i'm hungry, john.
we'll steal somethin' to eat.
it'll spoil our supper.
just look at you! dust and filth from top to toe!
want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
thank you, no. thank you, dear icey. i'll tend to them. thank you.
i'm hungry.
why, sure. and there's fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
can i have my supper please?
naturally.
can i have milk too?
yes. but first of all we'll have a little talk.
about our secrets.
no.
why, pray tell?
because john said i mustn't.
just tell me now; where's the money hid?
but i swore. i promised john i wouldn't tell.
john -- doesn't -- matter! can't i get that through your head, you poor, silly, disgusting little wretch!
now! where's it hid, honey?
i'll tell.
i thought i told you to keep your mouth shut --
no, -- it ain't fair to make pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. i'll tell.
all right boy: where's the money?
in the cellar. buried under a stone in the floor.
all right...  come along.
what?
go ahead of me -- the both of you.
you don't reckon i'd leave you.
don't you believe me?
why sure, boy, sure.
now where, boy? mind; no tricks. i can't abide liars.
yonder.
now: where?
under the stone in the floor.
pearl, shut up! pearl, you swore!
you could save him, little bird.
john?
hush, pearl. come on.
uncle birdie!
don't!
hide us uncle birdie! he's a-comin' with his knife!
please be quiet -- oh please, pearl!
john, where are we g --
hush.
get in the skiff, pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
that's daddy!

now ain't you relieved, walt?
sure, but you was worried too, mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. i even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
