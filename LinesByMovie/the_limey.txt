edward rama?
eduardo.  rama.
you are home, then.
i did not expect anyone.
no reason.
i mean, what has it been -- six months?
round about, yeah.
i did not even know who i was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. she never talked about any family.
it was better than a telegram.
who done it, then?
huh?
snuffed her.
i never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  no, no, no.  that is not what i wrote to you.
no, but between the lines, eh? mysterious circumstances, and that.
this bloke she was bunked up with.  this terry what'sit.
terry valentine.
valentine.  what is he got to say for himself?
i dunno.  what is he going to say?  they had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  i do not even know the guy. do not get me wrong, jenny and me were friends, but we did not travel in the same social circles.  she had her life, i had mine.
what more is there.
I am just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  there was no moon that night ...
coulda happened to anyone, man.  i never knew her to be reckless.  i mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks.  but that is it, nothing more than that.
no, not my girl.  self-control, she had. point of pride.  and people do not change, do they.
i dunno ... maybe they do.
boomerang.
y'what?
i knew when i was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was going to come back and smack me in the face.  i did my time, okay?  my sister, her old man's up in chino right now doin' eight years.
this am not your lot?
you kiddin', man?  i do not need a wife and screamin' kids.  i still got my youth.
i go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  what d'you want from me.
i only asked.
what, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
that is what i thought, man.  but it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. it was someplace else.
where abouts?
bad place, man.  bad people.  some guys loading some trucks.  some kinda deal goin' down.  i do not know and i do not care.  maybe they are shipping fava beans to eskimos.
did jenny know?
valentine was not even there.  if he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say.  but I will tell you something.  she stood in front of these dudes, man.  eyeballing them.  checking them out.  i felt like she was covering my ass that day.
what you gonna do, man?  you gonna go to the cops?
nah, coppers do not do nothing, do they.
those streets up in the hills, man. got to be real careful, keep your eye on the ball.  two of the clock in the morning, it is dark, your mind is all agitated, you are drivin' a little too fast ...  those curves do not kid around.
you should talk to elaine.  that was her best friend.
she did not write to me, did she.
she did not know what to say.  i thought someone should say something. to someone.  with me it was, i do not know -- jenny liked me for some reason.  i felt like i owed her.
who would jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever?
not me, man.  I am no drug dealer, what you think.
i think you did not get that lot in the navy, doing your national service.
i already told you, man.  corcoran.  know what that is?  state prison.
nick's a nick, n' it?  no matter what state you are in.  state of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
but that is not me anymore.  that is when i was into the gang lifestyle.  that is not who i am now.  five years in the joint -- that is it for me, man.
you are kiddin' me, right?
what do i do, then, look in the bleedin' yellow pages?
these are not guys you can just go run a number on, man.
thought perhaps there would be dispensing machines, you know.  bung in your coins, come out with a .44 magnum, fully-loaded.
are you a resident of california? you gonna fill out forms, man?  do the background check?  go through a three-day waiting period?
sod that.  got to get back before my probation officer wonders where I have skived off to.
probation?  man, you crazy.  they shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
man knows what he likes.
lookin' good.
that is a high-end item.  total reliability.
what did you call that -- the protector?
yes, sir.  will not find a better cqc on the market.
cq what?
close quarters combat.  keep one in my own home.
oh really?  where you from?
england.  only, we saw there was a show on, thought i might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
you came to the right place, sir.  my wife's second cousin is english.  well, scotch-irish.  can i interest you in a holster?
just luck, this, really.  never been to one of these before.
you are in gun country now, my friend.
been to the boat show.
packs a punch, but it is compact, has accessible features -- makes a nice concealed-carry piece.
he do not have a concealed weapons permit.
do not have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  just popped over on a quick visit.
i can take care of the paperwork.
yeah?
no problem.  if you do not have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen.
no.  not at all.  do we?
not me, man.
i mean, it is already a steal, n'it -- what you said -- four hundred for this one?
you hadda show up on a weekend.  this weekend.  wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month.
fucking out of order, that.  should not be allowed.
now what.  you gonna take your new arsenal, go visit terry valentine, just like that?  boom bam boom.
it is only insurance.  can not be too careful.  this terry valentine, he is probably a wonderful fella.  they were together how long?
five years, i think.  long time.
well, there you are.  jen must have liked him.
jenny told me she met him at the beach. got blinded by his smile.  you believe that shit?  son of a bitch never smiled at me.  buried her at a "private" service.  private for who. him?
hang about.  i thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with jenny.
he came in with jenny to the restaurant where i work.  that is not where they met.
and that is where you met jenny.
no, no -- jenny used to work as a waitress.  before she met him.  but that is not where she met me.  not in my restaurant.
how did the two of you hook up, then?
oh, jenny was in my acting class.
how did you get in here.
walked.
you walked.  what the hell are you doing here.
looking for a bloke named valentine. know him?
he is expecting you?
i doubt it.
so why would he want to see you.
i have a message for him.  about jennifer wilson.
jennifer wilson.
you know her?
yeah.  i know her, all right.  she came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. we lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  if she had not a' been terry's woman i would have broke her jaw.  'course, she is nobody's problem now.
is valentine here?
what do you think?
where is he, then?
listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
adhara.  i told your father, if you are looking for a name, you can not go wrong with a constellation.
i used to hate it.  now i like it.
could be worse, he could have named you reticulum.
is there anything in the world that you want or need?
i want to know why you need that scary guy in your house.
gordon?  he is been with me for years. he is not as tough as he looks.
then what good is he?
is it possible that you are too young to be acquainted with the idea of loyalty?
is that a problem?
not for you, clearly.
I am loyal to things that make me happy.
am i a thing?
well, you are certainly not a person.
I am not.
no.  you are not specific enough to be a person.  you are more like a vibe.
I am so glad we are having this chat.
it is not a knock.
it is not a compliment.
it is an observation.  like:  I am hungry. when are we eating?
as soon as you get dressed.
what kind of food?
anything but japanese.
why?
I am not into finger foods.  too fussy.
like you.
i do not like do-it-yourself cuisine. buffets.  salad bars.
you demand to be served.  a fork fetishist.
it is just fuel to me.  I am not there for distractions.
for some, eating is a sensual experience. the sensual experience.
that is what gordon's always saying.
oh, god.
what.
there is been some trouble downtown.
what kind?
what the papers used to call a "gangland slaying."
our black friends?
no, terry.  they do not work like that. jenny wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message.
i thought he was in prison, in england.
well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he is out, because he is here in l.a., looking for you.
italian?
I am sorry.
italian.
who?
not who, food.  should we get italian.
sure.
had a feeling it was you.
you look alike.
perhaps it was the smoke.
not her brand.
she used to pinch 'em off me.  funny that.  one thing she never tried to get me to stop.
why did you come here?
wanted to talk to you, did not i?
no, why did you come here?
sort a few things out.
been busy, have you.
how d'you mean?
it is been a while.
i was skint -- did not have no money to get here.
that is not what i heard.
what was that, then?
i heard you were -- what is that adorable phrase? -- "at her majesty's pleasure."
it was the bars, then.
in any case, i do not suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
sewing mailbags?  me?  never did an honest day's work in my life, dear. was not about to start when i was in stir -- not with all that leisure time on my hands.
and not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  from the wembley staduim job, was not it?  pink floyd concert receipts.  jenny would have been ... fourteen at the time?
hardly buried.  earning interest, love. earning interest in an offshore account. tidy little premium per annum, that.
well, that kind of security can not be bought.  must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you.
here, are not you going to let me in.
try calling me again.
... no, i went in for more improving pastimes.  philosophy classes, language courses, european history, all that lark. did you know that in paris in the eighteenth century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.
sounds like beverly hills.
here, are you always this sarky?
sarcastic, moi?  maybe I will mellow when my ship comes in.  it is expected any day now.  I am all packed and ready to go.
were not you on a television series?
if it played in england somebody owes me money.  who told you that -- eddie?
said it went on for donkey's years.
three seasons.  they found that is the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of mormons on the chisum trail.  i was wife number three -- the ingenue.
oh, it just ended, then.
now who is being sarcastic?
when you have lost as many years as i have, love, puts things in perspective, know what i mean.
I am sorry.  i guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went.  it must have been the bars.
i can not believe jenny told you all that. about me.  she was always so embarrassed.
not embarrassed.
ashamed.
not ashamed.
disappointed.
she never told eddie, though.
she never told anyone else.  about the convict strain -- or is it stain?  no, i was privileged.  i was someone who helped jenny efface her past.
how did you manage that, then.
when I am not honing my craft in episodic television i do double-duty as a voice coach.  not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  not with that look.
yeah, well, she started all that in london.
modelling.
learnin' 'ow to speak proper.  central school of speech and drama. it is no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. at seventeen.  they offered her a place at rada n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was jenny.  she could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper.  show up the old man, you know.
you were not disappointed in her, then.
in jenny?  'course not.  how could i be. 'course i wasn't.
she was twenty-one when she came to me.  ... straight from leaving you.
footloose and fancy free.
she was happy here.  however the two of you might have parted.  do not think she wasn't.
when did you get in?
yesterday.  afternoon.
you have not been lurking outside my building all day.
no, i had -- some other matters to attend to, you know.  getting a car sorted ...
i might have been away for the weekend.
well, i reckoned, saturday night, if you were goin' out, you would probably have to come home first.
and you have seen eddie rama.
yeah, saw eddie, yeah.  me and him are muckers.
i should really give him a call.  he is a character, is not he.  well, not to you. i meant to us squares in the outside world.
he give me your address.
i gave him yours.  said, here, you want to write, i think this is a relative.  i guess i thought i was being true to jenny.  who told me she did not have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
well, do not suppose she did, really, most of her life.  on her own after her mum died.  aunts and uncles for a time -- and then the bright lights beckoned.
were you still married at the time -- to jenny's mother, i mean?
nah, we split up when jenny was six.  her second husband done a runner after she got sick.  they give me compassionate leave from parkhurst to go visit her in hospital.  we were always mates, me and jenny's mum.  i like to think they are together again now.  y'know.  heavenly choir.
the address jenny gave me, that was not a prison, was it?
nah, accommodation address.
what is that, like a p.o. box.
something like that, yeah.
where you get your bank statements.
i already knew.  knew beforehand.  when was it supposed to have happened? -- two of the clock in the morning, eddie said.
that is what was estimated.
eight hours difference between here and london.  would have been, what, ten in the morning, my time.  i was just coming out on the yard.  now, i was in the habit of saving my newspaper till then.  bit of fresh air, stretch me legs -- well, stretch the day out, really, that is what you wanna do.  and I will tell ya:  i could not open the paper.  could not pry the pages apart -- it was like they was glued together.  that is how weak my hands went.  thought i was having heart attack, only i knew i wasn't.  bloke come up to me, he says, dave, he says, you have gone all white.  i said, fuck me, I have been in prison half my life, what d'ya expect. but he was dead on, 'cause i could feel the blood drain right out of me head. and i knew ...  something had happened to jen.
do you even know who terry valentine is?
well, i gathered something from the article what eddie sent me.  some sort of pop music producer, was not it.
lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing.  like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
now, you should not run yourself down.  my employer, mr. lindgren --
-- your employer?
-- mr. lindgren.
who is mr. lindgren?
my employer.
what line is he in.
proprietor of a london firm.  of longstanding.
i see.
based in london, but with international concerns.
i bet.
various enterprises, style of thing.
i thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
well, not to say mr. lindgren is dishonest, exactly.
right.
anyhow, he is always saying to me, dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you.
in what capacity are you employed by this mr. lindgren?
this and that.  y'know.  ways and means.
-- when he wants someone run down, you are willing to do it for him.
so what is the deal.  you and terry valentine at twenty paces.  is that what this is about.
why not.
are you serious.
have you ever known me not to be.
you fuckin' guys and your dicks.
what did you want me to do.  stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  doing sweet f.a. [fuck all].
you do not believe it was a car accident.
what do you think.
terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  not the type.
depends, don' it.
on what.  what makes you so certain.
I will bloody well ask him.
there is the phone.  you want his number.
told you you would not be able to see through that gate.
gate's open.  i had a butcher's at the house.
who would you butcher at the house?
butcher's hook.  look.  i do not much reckon those minders of his.
huh?
he is brought in the heavy mob.
what?
extra muscle.  bodyguards.
has he?
they look a right load of wallies. patrolling back and forth outside the gate, all ponced up like the fuckin' household cavalry.  watch it.
that was one of them?
see what i mean?  wearing bloomin' uniforms n' all.
what is so fucking funny?
those are not guards.  they are valets.
valets.  what d'ya mean valets.  what is he, then, the earl of fucking doncaster?
valets.  they park cars.  he is having a party.
valets, eh?  are not we all la-de-da.
i thought you just wanted to check out the house, man.
well, that is what we are doin', n' it.
no one else is even here yet.
first in, first out, that is me.
i like the colors.
we all did.
it must have been a time.  a golden moment.
hey, i thought you were not a buffet person.
I am a gracious host.
do not you work with ian?
ian?
i could swear i met you with ian at the emi offices in london.
sorry.  was not me.
you sure?
unless I am not who i think i am.
that is too bad.  ian's got a good thing going over there.
yeah?
turned that place completely around.  180 degrees.
no kidding.
what i like about ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I am saying?
right.  chain of respect.  that is good, that.
yeah.  i really admire the guy.  well. good to meet you.
yeah.  cheers, mate.
what are we standing on?
faith.
pleasure.
have we met?  there is something i can not quite --
emi in london.  i work with ian.
ah.
you must know ian.
i don't.
great bloke.  really turned things around there.  180 degrees.
i suppose that is good, unless things were fine the way they were.
oh, i think a shake-up was in order. definitely.  otherwise, people get lazy, do not they?  forgetful.  start thinking they can get away with things.  got to shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay attention.
thanks.  you, too.
be seein' you.
bring the motor around.  bang out in front, right?
you goin' back inside?
one thing i need.
steady on.
you steady on, man.  what the fuck else did you do back there.
why did not you just kill him, you had the chance.
that would be too easy.
too easy?
he is got to know why.
you think a fuckin' guy like that ever will?  what more do you want, man?
you should have let me do the talking.
why, because you are my security consultant?  this cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
what did you tell them.
i mean, gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds.
heavier than that now.  but are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story.
as it happens.  i did not make that part up.
and where is this guest?  do not they want to interview him.
i do not know everyone here.  he was so traumatized he split.  maybe he was gordon's pusher.
where do you think he is, mike.
we will find him.
no.  i mean.  not even your people should be involved.  right?  it is too close now.
you could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
you think I am staying?
there is already going to be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons.
well, can we make it one more.  nowhere the fuck near me.
hey.
come over here.
how they goin', kid?
not bad.
how did you like to kill someone for me?
okay.
same as last time -- the rest after.
where do we go?
when you find the guy, you will know.
what shit is this.  i just do it.  i do not prepare it.
I will point you in the right direction, but you will have to take it to the end- zone.  he is a hit-and-run gunman -- i figure he is not cruising the polo lounge.
this is un-fucking professional.
see, a successful man like me has limitations -- i lose touch at a street level.  so i have to depend on a smart boy like you who is closer to the nitty and the gritty than i am.
fuck you, mr. whatever-your-name is. this is a lifestyle i embrace.
that is why I am letting you take care of this.  I am the one with appearances to maintain.  but who gives a shit about you?  not even god.
jenny was supposed to come to my place that night.  she called me, asked if she could come over.  she and terry had been -- having some trouble.  lately.  i do not know about what.  on this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
she told you all about my details but not about his.  lovely.
she would never called me like that before. she sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid.  but she never turned up.  i called the house but only got the answer machine.  when they found her ... she would been going the wrong way. not the direction she would have gone if she would been coming to see me.  or coming straight to see me.  who knows.  maybe she just wanted to drive.
how did you come to have my address? found it, did you.  among her things.
you think terry gave me access to her things?  probably sold her clothes.
and how did you get it?
how much.
five thousand.
hey.
i got half.
makin' trouble for someone?
yeah.
which kind?
the forever kind.
this town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's."  christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.
early 70's.  i was away.  maidstone.  possibly brixton.
these more highlights from the zagat prison guide?
you do not seem bothered.
you do not know how I have compromised my standards.
tell us about it.
it is too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  anywhere else I would be an interesting little number, here I am just sag number forty-eight thousand and one.  sag meaning screen actor's guild.
oh, i was gonna say ...
still, there have been rewards.  it is sunny.  and some of the producers who call even have credits.
i can see the attraction.
what did you do?  to make them take the early 70's away from you.
a jeweller's up the west end.  we tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. filthy work.  trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- after we would made the grab, 'n all.  would you adam n' eve it.
you mean if they would nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
we were lucky to be nicked.  me and the lads went down there sunday evening, we were not discovered till the monday.  good job we were still breathing.
it did not discourage you, though.
hey?
from pursuing your chosen profession.
I will tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  put me right off any escape attempts.  tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  not bloody likely.
i was inside once.  i punched a cop at a demo.
did you.  what was that in aid of?
who remembers.
get seven years, did you?
overnight.  what about just now?
just now?  overnight?
you have been away.  or is all this just new to you?
it is true.  has to be said.  i got off to a slow start.
i do not believe it.
honest.  did not know where to look till i was 21.
pushing the legal limit even then.
I have lived in l.a. all my life, I have never done this drive.
all your life.  that happened while i swam the length of my pool.
what is the matter?
nothing.  i guess it is hard to pass on this road.
the freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
i sure hope so.
ever take a look at the women who work in pet stores?  wow.
good luck.
jesus, are you gay enough or what.
very attractive.  good idea.  now i really want to fuck you.
... you can always tell the ones who will do anal.
kinda makes you wonder why more people do not put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, does not it.
looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth.
why do not they have tv shows about people whose daily lives you would be interested in watching.  y'know.  like skinny little weakling.  or big fat guy.  sick old man. family of losers.  would not that be good?
two blacks and a mexican in a car.  who is driving?
i do not know.
the l.a.p.d.
maybe she does not even know the english guy.
avery said she was tight with his daughter.
that do not mean nothin'.
she is nice lookin'.
so what.
i dunno.  i just said she is nice lookin'.
and i said so what.  you think she is any happier?
what d'you mean, any happier?
any happier than any other asshole in life.
-- they want southern, i do southern, they want midwest, i do midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I am shit out of luck.  one thing i can not do is english. americans can't.  should not even try. and laurence olivier could not do us.
you ever been to london?
only in the movies.
I have 'ardly ever left it.
yeah, well, you are here now --  -- where hurricanes hardly ever happen.
I have got the hang of the driving.  found this place all right.
stick with me, kid.  looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes.
not that i recall.
what about your grandmother?
nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. crafty old sod.
he alive to see this?
dropped dead in the stalls in the odeon, muswell hill.  watching doris day.
what did your father do?
black market during the war.
i guess you are just habitual.
you sound like my fucking probation officer.
will not he be looking for you about now?
good luck to him.  he could not find his prick if he did not wear y-fronts.
minor officials bother you, do not they?
do us a favor.  can not even go have a slash without 'em saying, what are you going in there for?
i got a steady income -- I am on the dole.
a leech on the welfare state in addition. you do not miss a trick.
i fiddle it.  they got me down as an immigrant with five kids.
last time might as well've been the first.  i remember all the times, do not i.  watching her grow up --  in increments.
she told me you were a ghost in her life. daddy the friendly ghost.  coming back to haunt her.
well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy was not in the royal marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of borneo or playing iago in a worldwide tour of othello.
still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
she used to tell me she would turn me in.  little kid.  ten year old.  "if you are naughty, dad, I will tell on ya."  she did not want me sent down again, see. when i was planning some job.  "i'll tell 'em, dad, i promise i will.  here, look, I am calling the old bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  i can see her, the phone in her hand.  became a sort of joke between us.  only it was not a joke.
she never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
i know that.  but as time went on ... well, it wasn't a joke, was it?  she had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long I would get the hook for.  said she would not be there this time when i got out.
there is one thing i do not understand.  the thing i do not understand ... is every motherfucking thing you are saying.
look, mush, you are the guv'nor here, i can see that, I am on your manor now, right.  so there is no need to get out of your pram.  I am johnny-come-lately to all this.  whatever the bollocks between you and this slag valentine, it is got nothing to do with me.  i do not wanna know.
well, I will tell you.  i believe this valentine screwed me out of a fair sum of money.
i can well believe it.  I am sure he has done, son.  he is about as straight as a dog's hind leg.
but i can not be sure.  i do not even know who he is.  he is too insulated.  too many layers around him.
your guess is as good as mine, mate.  I am here on another matter entirely.
yeah, i guess you are.
good job your lot showed up when they did or it would have been me for the high jump.
that dude who works for valentine.  he is the one sent those guys after you.  you know that.
yeah.  should not wonder.  must have done.
so what is your beef, pal?
nothing financial.  strictly personal.  i can see how all this import-export malarkey might give rise to confusion where I am concerned.  a foreigner, showing up unexpectedly, like.
it was you.  downtown.
eh?
because that was not anything to do with me.  and suspicion has been cast in my direction.  did not make any sense.  choosing those shitheads over me, cutting me out of the deal, then screwing them over too.
no, i can reassure you on that point. valentine was just as surprised by that turn of events as you.
he would already grabbed more than his allotted cut.  did not think he would be so bold as to take all of it.
all of what?
of the deal, man.
oh, yeah, right.  the deal.
but if you are mad at him too and he is mad at you ... that must make us pals.
as you prefer, squire.  as you prefer.
in which case I will just do what i usually do.
and that is?
what am i doing?
straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
lemme break.
you broke last time.
let him break - he likes to break.
fuck you.
i would not talk.
huh?
i saw your mother on the strip last night.  she went up to three guys, said she would like 'em to stick one in each, know what i mean?
valentine had himself a party, i hear.
my client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
a statement?  i would not mind getting a statement.  you see, my client -- the united states government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.
deals?  my client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. you would have to be more specific.
your client have a deal in long beach? how about downtown?  there is some folks there -- oh, wait, they are all dead.  any of this ring a bell?
my client is an entrepreneur.  i am his lawyer, not his business manager.
so you would not have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
he is always been very forward-thinking. he invested wisely.
where is he now?
he had urgent business in the north.
where is big sur?
up the coast.
how far?
i do not know -- few hours, i guess.
fancy it?
i could use a vacation.  of course, i keep forgetting, for you this is a vacation.
never thought of that.  busman's holiday.
what is in big sur?
that is where valentine's scarpered.
how do you know?
bloke told me.
what d'you say, elaine?
not much -- you?
same.
uh-huh.
last time i saw you, were not you up for some equity-waiver thing?
probably.
i was gonna be in that michael mann movie, you know -- with pacino and deniro.  got three callbacks.
really.
did not get it.
well, those are the breaks.
not no more, they ain't.  i quit that acting shit, man.
you just cooking then?
hell, no.  i started writing.
we coulda used the other two-and-a-half grand.
there is more than a measly few grand in this.
there is?
something is on.
what?
i happen to know more about mr. whatever- his-name-is than he thinks i know about him and his operation.
you do?
you bet.
like what.
like he would never hire me for real.  not week-to-week.  i do not have the credentials.  he thinks I am just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
well, we blew it, did not we?  he am not wrong.
"he am not wrong."  listen, i know this asshole who did just go to work for him. full-time.  and this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  that's the type of individual gets hired, someone who will shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job.
i do not get it.
i do not know who that english guy is. some kind of --  -- courier or something.  maybe a seller. maybe a buyer.  but mr. avery wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and i betcha there is a briefcase somewhere.
what is in it?
drugs?  cash?  both if we are lucky.
how we gonna get that lucky?
while they are all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in.
I have been wondering something.
again?
do you have any friends, man?
yeah, i suppose.  call 'em that, yeah. down the boozer saturday night.  meet some of the lads.
friends and colleagues.
you can not count on very many people, that is the trouble.  number of times a decent job's been cocked up ...
poor baby.
useless gits.  i was gonna do the post office once.
what post office?
the lot.  the whole british bloody post office.  i had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. could i get anybody interested?  no -- they are too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman.  lazy sods.  jumble sale on in watford, they will be up at the crack of dawn.
you are just on a higher plane, wilson.
too bleeding true, 'n' it.
hello there.
what are you doing here?
exercising my visitation rights.
since when?
i miss my kids.
they are at college.  or does not your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore.
you have made it ... brighter.
i do not want you here, terry.
sure you do.
what kind of trouble are you in?
no trouble.
surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
susan.
where is ... what's-his-name -- fred --
-- you know his name is frank.
is he here?
you know i do not live with him.
go to him.  go to his studio, or writers workshop or artists colony, esselin retreat, nudist camp --
are you finished?
in a couple of days this whole thing --
who is looking for you?
go now.
it is been five minutes and I am packing to leave again.  i can not believe this.
that is right, your life is shit, and I am to blame.  it is that simple.
hey, elaine.  you even know what he is saying half the time?
no, but i know what he means.
... reminds me of jennifer.
hard to miss.
i thought maybe you just came for the ride.
I would rather be with him than without him. i do not want to be found dead in l.a.
we think someone is here.
we think?
we can not find ...  ... two of our guys.
no.
why not?
because --
what.
tell me.
tell you ...
about jenny.  tell me about jenny.  about the deal.  whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard.
she could have had the deal!  i would have handed it to her if she wanted.  i would have given her everything.
why then.  why did you do it!
yeah, that is right.
i can never decide what i like better. leaving home, or coming back.
i would have preferred staying home, me.
you are a reluctant traveller, then.
you will be looking forward to getting back, then.
yeah.  another little matter needs attending to soon as i return.
no rest for the wicked.
been away a lot.
where else?
out on a oil rig.  in the north sea. nine years.
nine years?  is that legal?
well, time off for good behavior, you know.  i should not have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place.  i got lumbered with the job they were responsible for.  i do not mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what i mean.
but you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
i had to, did not i.  nothing else for it. then just when I would finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, i had to bugger off to the states.
sounds like you need a rest.
could do, yeah.
but first i gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
the ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
yeah.
