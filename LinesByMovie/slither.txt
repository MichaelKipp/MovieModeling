he's teaching environmental science, grant. probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
oh yeah, that's what he wants to borrow, this guy.
it's just a work thing.
work thing hell, starla. he just wants to get in your pussy. him and most these other ones around here. that's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
grant, no -- i'm sorry, i'm just -- i'm not in the mood. grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. grant come on, baby, it's --
i'm sorry. i don't just have some switch.
sure you do.
flip.
that's disrespectful.
where are you going?
i'm just some big clown to you, ain't i?
that's not true -- where are you--?
out.
megan halesy' little sister.
shit. you're kidding me. nope. brenda brenda! grant hell, you were --
my sister megan, she's a big fat cow. was then, even more so now. i'd be thinking, what'd you see in her ain't in me?
shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
hell, i was game!
who's the lucky fella?
fuck lucky. never marry a damn half--mexican.
already ain't. married a gal named --
starla covington. don't be ignorant. everyone knows that. fucking prom queen.
i never danced in a towel before.
wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. i remember it.
meat.
howdy, mr. grant. you goin' to the deer cheer this weekend?
sure thing, killer.
what can i do you for?
thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big ol' rib eyes.
how many you need?
hell, what am i holding back for? why don't you just give me everything you got here?
all the rib eyes?
yep. and while you're at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what's this here? osso buco?...
welcome home.
grant? why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
yeahhhh. i'm sorry. i just got so excited about... your present.
my present?
you're my princess, aren't you?
okay.
i got a super--special birthday present for you this year. i couldn't risk you finding it, so i had to put them locks on the doors.
what are you doing?
you're pretty.
who's that?
it's just one of my students, grant.
what's she see in that douchebag?
that's the mystery of the ages there, trev. starla was seventeen when they got engaged. he was, like, in his thirties. no one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
ain't no mystery to it. she's raised in them shanties off st. luc. dirt--poor.
gold--digger, huh?
bill, you're chief of police now.
comes with some goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
you're right, jack. margaret, you're fired.
you're lookin' awful pretty.
shut up.
where's the old half--mexican?
took the kids to his mom's for the weekend.
guess it's hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that's all they know.
what?
stuff you can never imagine. feelings. big thoughts. and love. yeah. i'm inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. so, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt.
don't worry. the lurker ain't around. i checked.
that's not funny.
sorry.
whatcha' doin'?
tryin' to get a buzz on. but i'm too buff. too much muscle mass.
what you up to?
just checking out the lights.
pretty, ain't they?
i don't know. i've seen them so many times before. i guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
well that's only if you're in the wrong spot.
there's a place over there on the bluffs. when the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of main look like a kaleidoscope.
oh, yeah?
mm hm. but only a few folks know how to get there. wally. rollo linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. me.
i'll get wally to show me sometime then.
grant, where'd you go?
hey, grant.
surprised you're able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
hey, wally. glad you're here. there was something i wanted to tell you...
what?
oh yeah. fuck you, fat ass.
grant. oh my god. what happened to your -- ?
heh. it ain't as bad as it looks, sugarplum. dr. carl was just here. i had a reaction to a bee sting. he gave me a prescription. said i should be fine, in a couple days.
i'll get if for you.
no! no. heh. i'll be right back.
grant? grant, i'm hungry. i'm so fuckin' hungry i think i'm gonna die.
brought you munchies.
maybe she's ever called the house, or -- ?
no. what?
she disappeared friday night. we got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
some kids found her necklace near tipper creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
the problem, starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was grant.
why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
grant, no!
i loved you. i loved --
grant, you're sick!
how about brenda?
new? no. we're hoping we find grant, he'll lead us to her.
shit.
bill, we need to talk!
'mornin', jack.
bill, this brenda's randy flagg's niece. we need to find grant yesterday! the town council has lit a roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
hell, jack, your leisure activities ain't my business.
don't fuck with me, bill. your post here as chief is in dire straits you don't work this shit out.
how are you going to find him?
dude's a half--squid. ain't many places he can hide. sea world, maybe.
that young lady heard you say 'squid.' she's gonna go out and create a goddamn hysteria!
sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
what?
touch some deer feces out in the forest. eat a sandwich without washing your hands. then you got lyme disease.
and that makes you look like a squid?
i'll tell you what, no one with lyme disease gonna win any damn handsome contests!
rorschach.
what do you see? i see a butterfly.
so he drags the cow backwards here. only he prolly didn't know 'bout the castavets had them dogs.
hey, look!
he's gotta be in the forest. all three ranches run alongside it.
think we should get up a search party, head in there?
looks like a chipmunk.
your momma wasn't too proud when you came out neither, wally.
and then we get here, the castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
i see. it's like as if he's going in a pattern. is that what you're saying, bill?
bill, i heard what you're doing. i think i should go along.
why? listen, it doesn't matter. i gotta go.
wait! dammit, bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? how, unless you bring grant in alive? your best chance of doing that is with me. i can talk to him --
he tried to kill you, starla.
he did. i know. but i got him angry 'cause i wasn't calm. this time i could --
please, bill. what happened, it's my fault, i know it.
starla, it ain't --
it is. he'd been acting strange. and the physical changes. i should have told someone right away... but i was just blind. i wanted to pretend it wasn't happening... if i don't do what i can to help now, i just couldn't live with it.
where'd he go?
we ain't never gonna find that girl now.
i think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
what the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, bill?
praise jesus.
'praise jesus?' that's fucking pushing it, margaret.
no reception out here.
bill, i'll run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
maybe you better sit back down. you don't look so good.
margaret.
where are you?!
we're coming your way, man!
you dig that rat out of the hole?
listen, you got any reports of... i don't know what you call 'em. they look like big slugs, only fast.
slugs? no. 'less you talkin' about that new waitress down at sloan's! ha ha!
shelby --
oh, shit! i hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. if so, i apolog
shelby, shut up. keep an eye out for these things. if you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. otherwise they'll go straight down it. all right?
are you nodding?
yeah.
i can't hear when you're nodding.
sorry.
we'll be there in ten minutes.
but not always. i was -- he was... other stuff too.
what other stuff?
he's a fucking martian?!
a martian is from mars, trevor.
now he's here. he went in mr. grant.
through a wound on his stomach?
he took him over. his body. his -- his brain, everything what he knew. he's only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. he liked being human. didn't want to change.
and you said the worms are part of him. they're all linked, like one creature?
when one sees you they all see you.
an animal that doesn't procreate. it spreads, grows. a living disease.
shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. come pick us up.
i got to leave my post.
do it.
was always curious why you... married grant in the first place... just never seemed outta love.
i know what people say, bill. i... remember, back in high school i worked at my father's gas station?
grant used to get filled up every day. i knew it was just to see me. he was too old -- but he was handsome. and he had that big ol' lincoln then. i flirted with him.
well, big ol' lincoln, sure. guess i would have flirted with him too.
my father, he was -- he was real close to evil. people didn't know. still don't. from the time i was a toddler he'd beat the hell out of me. i don't mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. and when i turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. starla looks at bill, who seems struck.
when you wanted to run away, i called your dad.
that wasn't a good night, no.
i'm sorry.
after all this shit tonight, i know for sure now you regret not running off with me to hollywood!
hell, starla. i always regretted that.
when i buy my zoo, i'm leaving them things the hell out!
shelby!
hey there, chief.
shelby! we need people out here at cosgrove and mccammon right away!
don't worry, chief.
what the hell are we going to do?!
just block the doors, any way you can.
what are you doing?!
we can't make it. just get away, when you get the chance.
what?
he wants me, bill! i'm going to get him to take me to him! see if you can follow me, and kill him!
no, starla! no!
we can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
yeah. good.
i'll get it for you. ibuprofen or aspirin?
aspirin.
we'll just head up here into bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. then maybe we'll head off to hollywood after all, huh?
okay.
please, starla. i'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
you took bill.
it's my nature.
and this is mine.
