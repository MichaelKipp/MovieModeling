he is teaching environmental science, grant. probably wants to borrow my lesson plans from last semester.
oh yeah, that is what he wants to borrow, this guy.
it is just a work thing.
work thing hell, starla. he just wants to get in your pussy. him and most these other ones around here. that is where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
grant, no -- I am sorry, I am just -- I am not in the mood. grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. grant come on, baby, it is --
I am sorry. i do not just have some switch.
sure you do.
flip.
that is disrespectful.
where are you going?
I am just some big clown to you, am not i?
that is not true -- where are you--?

megan halesy' little sister.
shit. you are kidding me. nope. brenda brenda! grant hell, you were --
my sister megan, she is a big fat cow. was then, even more so now. I would be thinking, what did you see in her am not in me?
shit, girl, you couldn't'a been eleven.
hell, i was game!
who is the lucky fella?
fuck lucky. never marry a damn half--mexican.
already ain't. married a gal named --
starla covington. do not be ignorant. everyone knows that. fucking prom queen.
i never danced in a towel before.
wearing white, just like on our... wedding day. i remember it.
meat.
howdy, mr. grant. you goin' to the deer cheer this weekend?
sure thing, killer.
what can i do you for?
thinkin' 'bout getting me a couple of these big old rib eyes.
how many you need?
hell, what am i holding back for? why do not you just give me everything you got here?
all the rib eyes?
yep. and while you are at it, get me a few of them chicken wings... some pork loins... and, ooo, what is this here? osso buco?...
welcome home.
grant? why are there -- did you put locks on the garage?
yeahhhh. I am sorry. i just got so excited about... your present.
my present?
you are my princess, are not you?
okay.
i got a super--special birthday present for you this year. i could not risk you finding it, so i had to put them locks on the doors.
what are you doing?
you are pretty.
who is that?
it is just one of my students, grant.
what is she see in that douchebag?
that is the mystery of the ages there, trev. starla was seventeen when they got engaged. he was, like, in his thirties. no one even knew they were goin' out till she had that ring on her finger.
am not no mystery to it. she is raised in them shanties off st. luc. dirt--poor.
gold--digger, huh?
bill, you are chief of police now.
comes with some goddamn responsibility, like keeping your people in line.
you are right, jack. margaret, you are fired.
you are lookin' awful pretty.
shut up.
where is the old half--mexican?
took the kids to his mom's for the weekend.
guess it is hard to explain how amazin' a human brain is to someone who that is all they know.
what?
stuff you can never imagine. feelings. big thoughts. and love. yeah. I am inclined to parlay it into somethin' more. so, go ahead there, beautiful, and take off your shirt.
do not worry. the lurker am not around. i checked.
that is not funny.
sorry.
whatcha' doin'?
tryin' to get a buzz on. but I am too buff. too much muscle mass.
what you up to?
just checking out the lights.
pretty, am not they?
i do not know. I have seen them so many times before. i guess any spot gets boring after awhile.
well that is only if you are in the wrong spot.
there is a place over there on the bluffs. when the fog is just right, like tonight, the lights of main look like a kaleidoscope.
oh, yeah?
mm hm. but only a few folks know how to get there. wally. rollo linkski coulda taken you, but 'course he got hit by that train. me.
I will get wally to show me sometime then.
grant, where did you go?
hey, grant.
surprised you are able to lift a mug after carrying that torch for so long.
hey, wally. glad you are here. there was something i wanted to tell you...
what?
oh yeah. fuck you, fat ass.
grant. oh my god. what happened to your -- ?
heh. it am not as bad as it looks, sugarplum. dr. carl was just here. i had a reaction to a bee sting. he gave me a prescription. said i should be fine, in a couple days.
I will get if for you.
no! no. heh. I will be right back.
grant? grant, I am hungry. I am so fuckin' hungry i think I am going to die.
brought you munchies.
maybe she is ever called the house, or -- ?
no. what?
she disappeared friday night. we got reason to believe foul play might be involved.
some kids found her necklace near tipper creek, as well as what might be her blood on a rock.
the problem, starla, is, the last person anyone saw her talking to was grant.
why did you betray me, sugarplum?!
grant, no!
i loved you. i loved --
grant, you are sick!
how about brenda?
new? no. we are hoping we find grant, he will lead us to her.
shit.
bill, we need to talk!
'mornin', jack.
bill, this brenda's randy flagg's niece. we need to find grant yesterday! the town council has lit a roman candle and stuck it up my ass!
hell, jack, your leisure activities am not my business.
do not fuck with me, bill. your post here as chief is in dire straits you do not work this shit out.
how are you going to find him?
dude's a half--squid. am not many places he can hide. sea world, maybe.
that young lady heard you say 'squid.' she is going to go out and create a goddamn hysteria!
sherry, you gonna create a hysteria?
what?
touch some deer feces out in the forest. eat a sandwich without washing your hands. then you got lyme disease.
and that makes you look like a squid?
I will tell you what, no one with lyme disease going to win any damn handsome contests!
rorschach.
what do you see? i see a butterfly.
so he drags the cow backwards here. only he prolly did not know 'bout the castavets had them dogs.
hey, look!
he is got to be in the forest. all three ranches run alongside it.
think we should get up a search party, head in there?
looks like a chipmunk.
your momma was not too proud when you came out neither, wally.
and then we get here, the castavets', where last night's shit--storm took place.
i see. it is like as if he is going in a pattern. is that what you are saying, bill?
bill, i heard what you are doing. i think i should go along.
why? listen, it does not matter. i got to go.
wait! dammit, bill, if that girl's still out there, how will you find her? how, unless you bring grant in alive? your best chance of doing that is with me. i can talk to him --
he tried to kill you, starla.
he did. i know. but i got him angry 'cause i was not calm. this time i could --
please, bill. what happened, it is my fault, i know it.
starla, it am not --
it is. he would been acting strange. and the physical changes. i should have told someone right away... but i was just blind. i wanted to pretend it was not happening... if i do not do what i can to help now, i just could not live with it.
where did he go?
we am not never going to find that girl now.
i think we best get you to a hospital right quick.
what the fuck they gonna do with her in a hospital, bill?
praise jesus.
'praise jesus?' that is fucking pushing it, margaret.
no reception out here.
bill, I will run out to your car, call for paramedics from there.
maybe you better sit back down. you do not look so good.
margaret.
where are you?!
we are coming your way, man!
you dig that rat out of the hole?
listen, you got any reports of... i do not know what you call 'em. they look like big slugs, only fast.
slugs? no. 'less you talkin' about that new waitress down at sloan's! ha ha!
shelby --
oh, shit! i hope she am not a police radio aficionado. if so, i apolog
shelby, shut up. keep an eye out for these things. if you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. otherwise they will go straight down it. all right?
are you nodding?
yeah.
i can not hear when you are nodding.
sorry.
we will be there in ten minutes.
but not always. i was -- he was... other stuff too.
what other stuff?
he is a fucking martian?!
a martian is from mars, trevor.
now he is here. he went in mr. grant.
through a wound on his stomach?
he took him over. his body. his -- his brain, everything what he knew. he is only been dumb stuff before amoeba--things, and rhino--things. he liked being human. did not want to change.
and you said the worms are part of him. they are all linked, like one creature?
when one sees you they all see you.
an animal that does not procreate. it spreads, grows. a living disease.
shelby, we broke down on 22, a mile outside town. come pick us up.
i got to leave my post.
do it.
was always curious why you... married grant in the first place... just never seemed outta love.
i know what people say, bill. i... remember, back in high school i worked at my father's gas station?
grant used to get filled up every day. i knew it was just to see me. he was too old -- but he was handsome. and he had that big old lincoln then. i flirted with him.
well, big old lincoln, sure. guess i would have flirted with him too.
my father, he was -- he was real close to evil. people did not know. still don't. from the time i was a toddler he would beat the hell out of me. i do not mean just like a smack for smart--mouthing... he took a real enjoyment in it. and when i turned eleven or twelve, things... well, they got worse. starla looks at bill, who seems struck.
when you wanted to run away, i called your dad.
that was not a good night, no.
I am sorry.
after all this shit tonight, i know for sure now you regret not running off with me to hollywood!
hell, starla. i always regretted that.
when i buy my zoo, I am leaving them things the hell out!
shelby!
hey there, chief.
shelby! we need people out here at cosgrove and mccammon right away!
do not worry, chief.
what the hell are we going to do?!
just block the doors, any way you can.
what are you doing?!
we can not make it. just get away, when you get the chance.
what?
he wants me, bill! I am going to get him to take me to him! see if you can follow me, and kill him!
no, starla! no!
we can probably get some first aid and food at this gas station up here.
yeah. good.
I will get it for you. ibuprofen or aspirin?
aspirin.
we will just head up here into bishopville, get checked up in the hospital. then maybe we will head off to hollywood after all, huh?
okay.
please, starla. I am going to do my best not to hurt anybody --
you took bill.
it is my nature.
and this is mine.
