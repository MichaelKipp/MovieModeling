welcome. back, mr. dalton.  how is your father?
doing fine, sir.
your family move into that new house, mr. overstreet?
i hear we are going to be roommates. neil perry.
todd anderson.
why did you leave balincrest?
my brother went here.
oh, so you are that anderson.
my parents wanted me here all along but my grades were not good enough.  i had to go to balincrest to pull them up.
well, you have won the booby prize.  do not expect to like it here.
i don't.
hey, i heard you went to summer school?
yeah, chemistry.  my father thought i should get ahead.
well, meeks aced latin and i did not quite flunk english so if you want, we have got our study group.
sure, but cameron asked me too.  anybody mind including him?
what is his specialty, brown-nosing?
hey, he is your roommate.
that is not my fault.
charlie dalton.
knox overstreet.
todd's brother is jeffrey anderson.
oh yeah.  sure.  valedictorian, national merit scholar
well, welcome to "hell"ton.
it is every bit as hard as they say. unless you are a genius like meeks.
he flatters me so I will help him with latin.
and english, and trig
but father, I am assistant editor.
I am sorry, neil.
but father, it is not fair.
fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
i will not be disputed in public, do you understand me?
father, i was not disputing you.
when you have finished medical school and you are on your own, you can do as you please.  until then, you will listen to me.
yes sir.  I am sorry.
you know what this means to your mother, do not you?
yes sir.
you know me, always taking on too much.
good boy.  call us if you need anything.
why does not he let you do what you want?
yeah!  tell him off!  it could not get any worse.
wait a minute.  i do not let my parents walk on me.
yeah, you just do everything they say! you will be in daddy's law firm as sure as I am standing here.  and you will be approving loans till you croak.
okay, so i do not like it any more than you do.  I am just saying
then do not tell me how to talk to my father when you are the same way.  all right?!
all right.  jesus, what are you gonna do?
what i have to do.  screw the annual.
i certainly would not lose any sleep over it.  it is just a bunch of people trying to impress nolan.
screw it all.  i do not give a damn about any of it.
i do not know about anyone else, but i could use a refresher in latin.  eight of the clock in my room?
sure.
you are welcome to join us, todd.
so what do you think of my father?
I will take him over mine.
what?
nothing.
todd, if you are going to make it around here, you have got to speak up.  the meek might inherit the earth but they do not get into harvard. know what i mean?
gather ye rosebuds while ye may.  the latin term for that sentiment is "carpe diem." anyone know what that means?
carpe diem... seize the day.
very good, mr._?
meeks.
seize the day while you are young, see that you make use of your time.  why does the poet write these lines?
weird.
but different.
oh come on, cameron, do not you get anything?
how about a trig study group?  right after dinner.
they are friends of my dad.  probably in their nineties or something.
listen, anything's, better than mystery meat.
want to come to the study group?
thanks but  I would better do history.
pleased to meet you.
the pleasure is mine.
it is all right, chet.
it is not all right.  come on, dad
so, uh, where are you in school?
ridgeway high.  how is henley hall, gin?
that is your sister school, right?
sort of.
you going out for the henley hall play?  they are doing "a midsummer night's dream."
chris.  we got it.  let's go.
nice meeting you, knox.  bye, gin.
how was dinner?
terrible.  awful!  i met the most beautiful girl I have ever seen in my life!
are you crazy? what is wrong with that?
she is practically engaged to chet danburry.  mr. mondo jocko himself.
too bad.
it is not too bad.  it is a tragedy! why does she have to be in love with a jerk?!
all the good ones go for jerks, you know that.  forget her.  take out your trig book and figure out problem twelve.
i can not just forget her, pitts.  and i certainly can not think about math!
you really think i should forget her?
you have another choice.
the hoi polloi.  does not it mean the herd?
precisely, meeks. greek for the herd. however, be warned that, when you say "the hoi polloi" you are actually saying the the herd.  indicating that you too are "hoi polloi."
thigh man?  mr. "k" was a hell raiser.
what is the dead poets society?
any group pictures in the annual?
nothing.  no mention of it.
yes sir.  we were just talking about that.
good.  we are very excited about him.  he was a rhodes scholar, you know.
mr. keating? sir? oh captain my captain.  what was the dead poets society?
ah, so you boy's have been snooping.
i was just looking in an old annual and...
nothing wrong with research.
what did the name mean.  did you only read dead poets.
all poetry was acceptable.  the name simply referred to the fact, that to join the organization, you had to be dead.
i say we go tonight.  everybody in?
where is this cave he is talking about?
beyond the stream.  i think i know.
that is miles.
sounds boring to me.
do not come.
you know how many demerits we are talking?
so do not goddam come!  please.
all I am saying is we have to be careful. we can not get caught.
well, no shit, sherlock
who is in?
I am in.
well...
oh come on, pitts...
his grades are hurting, charlie.
then you can help him.
what is this, a midnight study group?
forget it, pitts, you are coming.  meeks, your grades hurting too?
all right.  I will try anything once.
except sex.
I am in as long as we are careful.
knox?
i do not know.  i do not get it.
come on.  it will help you get chris.
it will?  how do you figure?
women swoon!
but why?
what is it then?
i... i just do not want to come.
but why?  do not you understand what keating is saying?  do not you want to do something about it?
yes.  but
put what?  goddamn it, tell me.
i do not want to read.
what?
keating said everybody took turns reading.  i do not want to do it.
god, you really have a problem, do not you?  how can it hurt you to read?  i mean is not that what this is all about? expressing yourself?
yaa, I am a dead poet!
ahh!  eat it, dalton!
this is it.
i went to the woods because i wanted to live deliberately."  i wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life!"
all right.  I will second that.
to put the rout all that was not life.  and not, when i came to die, discover that i had not lived.  pledge overstreet.
the millions are awake enough for physical labor; but only one in a million is awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred millions to a poetic or divine life.  to be awake is to be alive.
hey, this is great.
if you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost.  that is where they should be.  now put foundations under them.
god, i want to do everything!  I am going to explode.
i here and now commit myself to daring!
so avoid using the word 'very' because it is lazy.  a man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  do not use very sad, use morose.  language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  it also will not do in your essays.
I have found it.
found what?
what i want to do!  right now. what is really inside of me.
a midsummer night's dream. what is it?
a play, dummy.
i know that.  what is it got to do with you?
they are putting it on at henley hall. see, open try-outs.
so?
so I am going to act!  ever since i can remember I have wanted to try it.  last summer i even tried to go to summer stock auditions but of course my father would not let me.
and now he will?
hell no, but that is not the point.  the point is for the first time in my whole goddamned life, i know what i want, and for the first time I am going to do it whether my father wants me to or not! carpe diem, goddamn it!
neil, how are you going to be in a play if your father will not let you?
first i got to get the part, then I will worry about that.
will not he kill you if you do not let him know you are auditioning?
as far as I am concerned, he will not have to know about any of it.
come on, that is impossible.
horseshit.  nothing's impossible.
why do not you ask him first?  maybe he will say yes.
that is a laugh.  if i do not ask, at least i will not be disobeying him.
but if he said no before then...
jesus christ, whose side are you on?  i have not even gotten the part yet.  can not i enjoy the idea even for a little while?
by the way, there is a meeting this afternoon.  you coming?
i guess.
none of what mr. keating has to say means shit to you, does it?
what is that supposed to mean?
being in the club means being stirred up by things.  you look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
you want me out...  is that what you are saying?
no, i want you in.  but being in means you got to do something.  not just say you are in.
listen neil, i appreciate your interest in me but I am not like you.  when you say things, people pay attention.  people follow you.  I am not like that.
why not?  do not you think you could be?
no!  i do not know,  I will probably never know.  the point is, there is nothing you can do about it so butt out, all right? i can take care of myself just fine.  all right?
er  no.
no?  what do you mean 'no'?
no.
you know what the dead poets would say: gather ye rosebuds while ye may...
but she is in love with: the moron son of my father's best friend.  what would the dead poets say about that?
i feel like I have never been alive.  for years I have been risking nothing.  i have no idea what i am or what i want to do! neil, you know you want to act.  knox wants chris.
needs chris!  must have chris!
meeks, you are the brain here.  what do the dead poets say about somebody like me?
i hereby declare this the charles dalton cave for passionate experimentation.  in the future, anyone wishing entry must have permission from me.
wait a minute, charlie. this should belong to the club.
it should, but i found it and now i claim it.  carpe cavern, guys.  seize the cave.
i gotta get to the tryouts.  wish me luck.
good luck.
neil, how are you gonna do this?
sssh.  that is what I am taking care of. they need a letter of permission.
from you?
from my father and nolan.
neil, you are not gonna...
quiet.  i have to think.
and do not limit poetry to the word. poetry can be found in a work of art, music, a photograph, in the way a meal is prepared--anything with the stuff of revelation in it.  it can exist in the most everyday things but it must never, never be ordinary  by all means, write about the sky or a girl's smile but when you do, let your poetry conjure up salvation day, doomsday, any day, i do not care, as long as it enlightens us, thrills us and--if it is inspired--makes us feel a bit immortal.
oh, captain, my captain. is there poetry in math?
a yawp?
a barbaric yawp.
good god, boy! yell!
yawp!
again!  louder!
yawp!
louder!
ahhhhhh!
all right!  very good!  there is a barbarian in there after all!
todd, there is a picture of whitman over the door.  what does he remind you of? quickly, anderson, do not think about it.
a madman.
a madman.  perhaps he was.  what kind of madman?  do not think!  answer.
a crazy madman.
use your imagination!  first thing that pops to your mind, even if it is gibberish!
a... a  sweaty-toothed madman.
now there is the poet speaking!  close your eyes and think of the picture. describe what you see.  now!
i... i close my eyes.  his image floats beside me.
a sweaty-toothed madman
a sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
excellent!  have him act.  give it rhythm!
his hands reach out and choke me all the time he mumbles slowly.  truth... truth is like a blanket that always leaves your feet cold.
stretch it, pull it, it will never cover any of us.  kick at it, beat at it, it will never be enough-
do not stop!
from the moment we enter crying to the moment we leave dying,  it will cover just your head as you wail and cry and scream!
look at this.
what is it?
the god of the cave.
charlie, that was great!  where did you learn to play like that?
my parents made me take clarinet but i hated it.  the sax is more sonorous.
god, i can not take it anymore!  if i do not have chris, I will kill myself.
knox, you gotta calm down.
no, I have been calm all my life!  if i do not do something, it is going to kill me.
where are you going?
I am calling her!
hello?
hello chris, this is knox overstress.
knox.  oh yes, knox.  I am glad you called.
you are?  she is glad i called!
well, sure!
chet's parents do not know about it, so please keep it quiet.  but you can bring someone if you like.
I will be there.  the danburrys.  friday night.  thank you, chris.
can you believe it?  she was gonna call me!  she invited me to a party with her!
at chet danburry's house.
yeah.
well?
so?
so you really think she means you are going with her?
well hell no, charlie, but that is not the point.  that is not the point at all!
what is the point?
the point is she was thinking about me! I have only met her once and already she is thinking about me.  damn it, it is going to happen!  i feel it.  she is going to be mine!
todd, what is the matter?
it is my birthday.
it is?  happy birthday.  you get anything?
this is your desk set.  i do not get it.
they gave me the exact same thing as last year!
oh..
oh.
well, maybe they thought you would need another one.  maybe they thought...
maybe they do not think at all unless it is about my brother!  his birthday's always a big to-do.  the stupid thing is, i did not even like the first one.
look, todd, you are obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
what?
i mean, this is one special gift!  who would want a football or a baseball bat or a car when they could get a desk set as wonderful as this one!
yeah!  and just look at this ruler!
it is such a strange name!  will not you tell us what it means?
i told you, that is a secret.
is not he precious?
oh, hi.  I am glad you made it.  did you bring anybody?
no.
ginny danburry's here.  look for her.
but, chris...
i gotta find chet.  make yourself at home.
charlie...
it is nuwanda.
nuwanda, what is going on?
nothing, unless you object to having girls here.
well, of course not.  it is just that... you could have warned us.
i thought I would be spontaneous.  i mean, that is the point of this whole thing, is not it?
where did you find them?
they were walking along the fence past the soccer field.  said they were curious about the school so i invited them to the meeting.
do they go to henley hall?
i do not think they are in school.
they are townies?!
cameron, what is the matter with you. you act like they are your mother or something.  you afraid of them?
hell no, I am not afraid of them just, if we get caught with them, we are dead.
no relation.  never heard of him. sorry.
say steve, where is your manners?  here's mutt's brother and you do not offer him a drink? want some bourbon?
actually i do not
so what the hell's mutt been up to?
actually i do not really know mutt.
to fucking mutt.
well, I would better find patsy.  say hello to mutt for me.
will do.
yeah!    do not you guys miss having girls here?
miss it?  it drives us crazy.  that is part of what this club is about.  in fact, I would like to announce that I have published an article in the school paper, in the name of the dead poets society, demanding girls be admitted to welton, so we can all stop beating off.
you what?!  how did you do that?
I am one of the proofers.  i slipped the article in.
oh god, it is over now!
why? nobody knows who we are.
do not you think they will figure out who did it?!  do not you know they will come to you and demand to know what the dead poets society is?   charlie, you had no right to do something like that!
it is nuwanda, cameron.
that is right, it is nuwanda.
and are we just playing around out here or do we mean what we say?  if all we do is come and read a bunch of poems to each other, what the hell are we doing?
you still should not have done it, charlie.  you do not speak for the club.
hey, would you not worry about your precious little necks?  if they catch me, I will tell them i made it up.  all your asses are safe.  look, gloria and tina did not come here to listen to us argue. are we going to have a meeting or what?
carpe breastum.  seize the breast.
huh?
oh chet, that feels fabulous,
it does?  what?
you know,
do not stop.
stop what?
chet...
what are you doing?!
knox?!
you fucked up little prick!
chet, you do not have to hurt him.
hey guys, why do not you show tina the dead poets garden?
garden?
i think he is sweet.
i think you are sweet.
you know what really excites me about you?
what?
every guy that i meet wants me for one thing my body.  you are not like that.
I am not?
no!  anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you are after my soul. make me up some more poetry.
but...
please!    it is so wonderful to be appreciated for my mind!
nuwanda?  please?
all right!  I am thinking!  "let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments; love is not love which alters when it alteration finds or bends with the remover to remove."
do not stop.
"o, no, it is an ever-fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken; it is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken."
this is better than sex any day.  this is romance!
welton academy, hello?  yes, he is, just a moment.  mr. nolan, it is for you.
what?!
who else was involved in this?
no one, sir.  it was just me.  i did the proofing so i inserted my article in place of rob crane's.
mr. dalton, if you think you are the first to try to get thrown out of this school, think again.  others have had similar actions and they have failed just as surely as you will fail.  bend over and grab your shins.
do you still insist that this was your idea and your idea alone?
yes... sir.
what is this "dead potts society"?  i want names.
it is only me, mr. nolan.  i swear. i made it up.
if i find that there are others, mr. dalton, they will be expelled and you will remain enrolled.  stand up.
what happened? were you kicked out?
no.
what happened?
I am supposed to turn everybody in, apologize to the school and all will be forgiven.
what are you going to do? - charlie?
damn it, neil, the name is nuwanda.
this was my first classroom, john, did you know that?  my first desk.
i did not know you taught.
english.  way before your time.  it was hard giving it up, I will tell you.  I am hearing rumors, john, of some unusual teaching methods in your classroom.  I am not saying they have anything to do with the dalton boy's outburst, but i do not think i have to warn you that boys his age are very impressionable.
your reprimand made quite an impression I am sure.
what was going on in the courtyard the other day?
courtyard?
boys marching.  clapping in unison.
oh that. that was an exercise to prove a point.  about the evils of conformity.
john, the curriculum here is set.  it is proven.  it works.  if you question it, what is to prevent them from doing the same?
i always thought education was learning to think for yourself.
at these boys' age? not on your life! tradition, john.  discipline.  prepare them for college, and the rest will take care of itself.
mr. keating!
i do not know what misguided impulse caused you to pull that ridiculous stunt, mr. dalton, but, whatever it was, i hope you have learned your lesson.
you are siding with mr. nolan?!  what about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?
sucking out the marrow does not mean getting the bone stuck in your throat, charles.  you still have responsibilities to yourself and those who care about you.
but i thought-
yeah?  like what?
like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
yes sir.
so keep your head about you--the lot of you--understood?
oh captain, my captain.  what if we do not know anything about someone like rahesh non?
rahesh non never existed, mr. meeks. you make him or someone like him up.  no self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one i received:
here, villain, draw and ready. where art thou?
i will be with thee straight.
follow me then to plainer ground.  god, i love this!
this play?
yes, and acting!  it is got to be one of the most wonderful things in the world. most people, if they are lucky, live about half an exciting life! if i could get the parts, i could live dozens of lives.
you should come to rehearsals.  i know they need people to work the lights and stuff.
no thanks.
lots of girls.  the girl who plays hermia is incredible.
I will come to the performance.
chicken shit.  where were we?
yea, art thou there?
put more into it!
yea, art thou there?!
that is it!  "follow my voice.  we will try no manhood here."  see you at dinner.
father!
neil, you are going to quit this ridiculous play immediately.
father, i--
do not you dare talk back to me!  it is bad enough that you have wasted your time with this absurd acting business.  but you deliberately deceived me!  who put this in your head? how did you expect to get away with it? answer me!
nobody-  i thought I would surprise you. I have got all as and-
did you really think i would not find out?!  "my niece is in a play with your son," mrs. marks says.  "you must be mistaken," i say.  "my son is not in a play."  you made a liar out of me, neil! now you will go tomorrow and tell them you are quitting.
father, i have the main part.  the performance is tomorrow night.  father, please.
i do not care if the world is coming to an end tomorrow night, you are through with that play!  is that clear?  is that clear!
yes sir.
we thought it would be good to break old habits, sir.
what is wrong with old habits, mr. overstreet?
they perpetuate mechanical living, sir. they limit your mind.
mr. overstreet, i suggest you worry less about breaking old habits and more about developing good study habits.  do you understand?
yes sir.
that goes for all of you.  now eat with your correct hands.
visit from my father.
do you have to quit the play?
i do not know.
why do not you talk to mr. keating about it?
what good will that do?
maybe he will have some advice.  maybe he will even talk to your father.
are you kidding?  do not be ridiculous.
this is stupid.
it is better than doing nothing.
anything else you would care to rifle through, mr. dalton?
I am sorry.  i, we
oh captain, my captain, we came here so i could talk to you about something.
okay.
actually, I would like to talk to you alone.
damn it, nuwanda.  you idiot.
i could not stop myself.
gosh, they do not give you much room around here, do they?
maybe they do not want worldly things distracting me from my teaching.
why do you do it?  i mean, with all this seize-the-day business, I would have thought you would be out seeing the world or something?
ah, but i am seeing the world, neil. the new world.  seeing a student like you take root and bloom.  it is worth everything.  that is why i came back here. a place like this needs at least one teacher like me.  did you come here to talk about my teaching?
mr. keating, my father is making me quit the play at henley hall.  when i think about carpe diem and all that, i feel like I am in prison!  i mean, i can see his point.  we are not a rich family like charlie's.  but he is planned the rest of my life for me and he is never even asked me what i want!
you can not live a life for someone else, neil.  you can only live for yourself. have you told your father what you just told me?  have you shown him your passion about acting?
are you kidding?  he would kill me!
then you are playing a part for him too, are not you?  a dangerously self- destructive one.
neil, i know this seems impossible but you have to go to your father and show him what you are feeling.  you have to let him see who you are-  it is your only chance.
i know what he will say.  he will say that acting is just a whim and that it is frivolous and that i should forget about it.  he will tell me how they are counting on me and to put it out of my mind "for my own good."
well, if it is more than a whim, then you will have to prove that to him.  you will have to show him with your passion and commitment that it is what you really want to do.  if that does not work, at least by then you will be eighteen and able to do what you want.
eighteen!  that is two years!  what about the play?  the performance is tomorrow night!
give your father the benefit of the doubt.  talk to him.  let him see who you are.
is not there an easier way?
not if you are going to stay true to yourself.
damn.  damn!  if i could just get chris to read this poem!
why do not you read it to her? it worked for nuwanda.
she will not even see me, pitts.
nuwanda recited poetry to gloria and she jumped all over him... right, nuwanda?
chris!
knox!  what are you doing here?
if chet sees you, he will kill you, do not you know that?
i do not care.  i love you, chris.  you deserve better than chet and I am it. please accept these.
knox, you are crazy.
knox, i do not believe this!
all I am asking you to do is listen.  "the heavens made a girl named chris, with hair and skin of gold to touch her would be paradise to kiss her glory untold."
how did it go?  did you read it to her?
yep.
all right!  what did she say?
i do not know.
what do you mean you do not know?
I will tell you later.
what did your father say? did you talk to him?
yeah.
really?  you told your father what you told me?  you let him see your passion for acting?
yeah.  he did not like it one bit but at least he is letting me stay in the play. of course, he will not be able to come. he will be in chicago on business.  but i think he is going to let me stay with acting.  as long as i keep my grades up.
but what if they see it, nuwanda?
so much the better.
chris!
knox, why are you doing this to me?
you can not be in here.
if they catch you here, we will both be in big trouble.
oh, but it is fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
i did not mean to make a fool of you.
well, you did!  chet found out and he is nuts.  it took everything i could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. you have to stop this stuff, knox.
but i love you.
you say that over and over but you do not even know me!
of course i know you!  from the first time i saw you, i knew you had a wonderful soul.
just like that?!  you just knew?
of course just like that.  that is how you always know when it is right.
and if it so happens that you are wrong? if it just so happens that i could care less about you?
then you would not be here warning me about chet.
look, I have got to go.  I am going to be late for the play.
are you going with chet?
chet?  to a play? are you kidding?
then come with me.
knox, you are so infuriating!
just give me one chance.  if you do not like me after tonight, I will stay away forever.
uh-huh.
i promise.  dead poets honor.  come with me tonight, then if you do not want to see me again, i swear I will bow out.
god, if chet found out he'd...
chet will not know anything.  we will sit in back and sneak away as soon as it is over.
knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
dead poets honor.
what is that?
my word
i have to go home. chet might call.
it is just for a little while. you promised.
we used to meet here on special occasions. who would like to convene the meeting?
"we went to the woods because we wanted to suck all the marrow out of life." anybody want to read?
come on boys, do not be shy.
i have something.
