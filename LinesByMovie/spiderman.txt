otto, i do not like thorkel any more than you do.  but he has got a point.
rosomoff, i have better things to do than teach introductory physics to mindless adolescents.
perhaps. but every now and then someone pays attention.  you did.
good morning, liz.
how very dull, peter parker.
it is too early to be clever.
it is never too early to be clever. describe in a sentence how you feel about me.
huh?
fill in the blank: "i blank elizabeth allan."
i-- uh--
uh is a good start.
i lov-loathe elizabeth allan. abhor, detest, despise--
oh.  well, i hate you and everyone who looks like you.
i hate the platonic idea of you.
i hate people with alliterative names.
i hate--
i hate your relatives, i hate your coffee, i hate your shoes.
no.  i was lying about the coffee.
thank god.
you maniac.  you will blow your scholarship.
they will never take me alive.
what is in there?
a little bunny i saved from dissection.
harry!
mr. parker.
hi, professor.  what is up?
-- but the dogs treed him between huxley and kafka.
poor harry.  always desperate for attention.  what about the bunny?
back to the lab.  harry'll probably lose his scholarship.
he will weasel out of trouble. again.
maybe.  i could have stopped it, though.
since you are feeling guilty, why not donate your pretzel to somebody who needs it?
my my.
yeah.  really gets to you if you let it.
i suppose.
you want to give them something, but they will just buy more ripple. and they smell so... bad.
what?
god, flash can be such a jerk.
but you like that in a man?
you should write that one down.
"flash," liz.  you are going out with something that calls itself "flash."
some prep school thing.
does it have a human name?
eugene.  admit it, peter-- you would do anything for a nickname like "flash."
I would never admit that.
hurry up, flash!
what are you doing this weekend?
I have got to study.
oh. maybe i should, too--
lizzy!
i was sort of hoping to get out of--
I am parked illegally!
too hip.  your photos suck, kid.
i think you are trying to tell me something.
come on, that is pure luck!  the guy was in the right place at the right time--
you make your own luck, parker! get into the middle of things, spend every day pounding the pavement of the city's mean streets--
there is nothing in there worth stealing!
that is the understatement of the year.
aunt may, you are trespassing.
your records are older than you are.  have you never heard of new wave?
when i moved out, you swore up and down you would not meddle--
oh, peter. a zit.
i am old enough to--
--but i did not feel like getting to know your roaches.
I will introduce you.
ick.  and those foul chemicals in the pots--
I am a photographer, remember?
anyway, I have decided to kidnap you for dinner in forest hills--
it is friday night...
yes.  do you have a date?
no.
the record--
it will shut itself off.
ha.  anti-gravitational particles.
power down.  i need to talk to you.
proof.  proof of a unified field. not just theory and equations-- experimental proof.
let's talk in the hall.
in this obsolete little cyclotron, I am solving the greatest physics problem of the 20th century.  with more power, i could--
I have had an extremely bad day, octavius.  a sophomoric prank in the library and punitive measures.
then the alumni reports came in-- fund-raising is down this year.
i could not care less.  what I have done is--
what you have done is make the entire physics department look foolish. you compare yourself to einstein; your colleagues compare you to bozo the clown.
this is the unified field!  all the forces of the universe tied together-- perfectly!
you have used up your grant. the electric bills alone exceed your annual salary.  not to mention the potential hazards of your radioactive fuel.
i do not care.  cretin.
that nobel prize will just have to wait.
no!
here you go, pete.
uh, uncle ben, i--
what, want a glass?
no. no, that is okay.
so, uh... how is college goin'?
same old stuff.  how is the pharmacy?
ah, ya know.  neighborhood's not what it used to be.  kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
you stop him?
was not worth gettin' upset over a milky way.  anyways, i was never much for, ya know, discipline.
i know.  still thinking about retiring?
eh.  if i ever get out from under. maybe take may to france or somethin'.
ya still follow the mets, pete?
nonot really.
s'funny.  when your mom and dad, uh, passed away, i had this idea. i wanted you to be the best baseball player in the world.
remember little league?
yeah, babe ruth you wasn't.
ya set for, uh, ya know-- money?
oh, sure.
cause if you get in a bind--
no, no.
yeah, ya like to do things on your own  i been thinkin' lately.  maybe i was not the, ya know, greatest dad--
oh, come on, ben ,that's not--
-- no, i mean... we... your aunt may not wantin' kids and all... i mean we both...
when you won that scholarship, i was proud of you.
i know.
I am always here, pete.
what the hell is that?
tofu.  ben, i wish you wouldn't.
oh, not that.  you promised you would burn it.
you were adorable.  the least you could do is use a glass.
absolutely no class.
funny thing happened after my physics class today. harry osborn--
use a fork.
a match made in heaven.
see?  you big dullard.
no.  no thank you.  i have work.
i heard about thorkel's order--
i left a paper in my desk.
you taking extension classes, mr. jameson?
parker-- you go here, right?  got your camera?
yeah--
get inside and get pictures.  fifty bucks.
can we make it a hundred?
seventy.  but i want blood and gore.  you know, sexy stuff.
can not focus...
gimme that.  pick it up later.
poison emergency.
hi.  I have got sort of a hypothetical question.  do you suppose the bite of a radioactive spider would transmit that spider's proportional strength and agility?
is this some sort of zen thing?
i mean, i suddenly have immense physical power, and the ability to crawl up walls--
do ya? lemme give you the number for bellevue.  that is 561-5151--
yeah, a psychiatric hospital. listen, I am serious--
now tell me you love me.
lemme down, bugface!
that is not even close.
are you okay?
get away from me, freak!
kid, you were terrific.  max reiss, novelty acts.  was that judo or something?  ah, skip it.  question is, can you do it again?
oh-- i do not know-- thanks, mr. reiss, but--
how are you doing, kid?
oh, look, mr. hogan, I am really sorry about what happened in there. really--
you can be great, kid, just stick with it. but let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
right.
no refund on the mask, y'know. health laws.
uh-huh. look, this should be skintight.  bright colors.  red, maybe a deep midnight blue.
what is this? a cockaroach?
a spider.  eight legs.
eh.  week from tomorrow.
how about tomorrow?
you are making my life difficult.
two suits by tomorrow for $400?
an even five i throw in the jacket.
deal.  but do not tell anyone.  i want to keep a low profile.
a bit melodramatic but if you could prove it that would tie in your unified field theory, the big bang, kaluza-klein--
ach, theories!  this was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
my self.  i do not matter.  this human life, all life- insignificant.  bodies-- bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh.
all right, we may be insignificant, imperfect creatures-- but we are all we have got.
you are wrong.  just for a moment, i heard, saw, felt-- i became creation.
creation? or its opposite?
truth. pure, eternal.  beyond the boundaries of mere mortality.
otto, we are mere mortals. you must never forget your own limits--
I will repeat the experiment.  i will hold the truth. that is the only thing that matters.
no. it isn't.
life and death matter. yours-- everyone's.  by comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
oh, roz.  my mind is so far beyond yours now.  i could beat you at chess now.
then you will be glad to know the university has decided not to press criminal charges against you. breaking and entering the minor matter of the total destruction of a 23 million dollar cyclotron
i will finish what I have begun
doubtless.  and you will have all the time in the world to pursue your work.   somewhere else.
ooooh.  your feet are on fire.
harry
"harry osborne diminishes the stature of the university."
let me guess.  the hunting dogs. you lost your scholarship.
"scholarship students must maintain dignity at all times."
i know.  I have got one too.
screw scholarships!   universities are death!  they make slaves of us all with their fetid ideas!  burn 'em down, i say!
great idea.  let me get some shoes. I will take you home.
why home? the real world beckons, man!  the possibilities are endless.  want to go up to the world trade center and laugh at new jersey?
you are so responsible it is disgusting. but you are my only friend... do you hate me?
do not be pitiful.
i am not pitiful!  i am the bridge to the bermensch!
i bet you do not think i appreciate you, parker.  i do.
well, thanks.  you would not believe what i went through to get those. right after you took my camera, this ambulan--
i like enthusiasm.  that is why i use a lot of smart-ass kids.  not just 'cause they work cheap.
mr. jameson--
i got a question, college boy.  what the hell am i supposed to do with these!?  i ask for disaster, pathos, what do i get?  salvador dali!  when i want artsy-fartsy double-exposures, I will ask for--
double-exposures? but they are not-- i was in--
i do not give a gerbil's ass how you got 'em!  i can not print this surreal garbage!
you print pictures of bigfoot!
bunch of kids at your goddamned college say their appliances attacked them.  did you get pictures?
mr. jameson--
no! washington square, manhole covers turn into flying saucers and radios explode like a-bombs.  did you get pictures?
can i get a word in edgewise?
no!  now get outta my face, kid.
hello, uh, mr. reiss?  i'm-- I am the guy who wrestled hulk hogan the other day.  the guy in the mask?
i was hoping you would call, babe. look, you got representation?
no
good. we will make it oral for now. meet me at rockefeller center at six tonight.
why? it is a wrestling match, or
letterman show, nbc. we will talk then.  bye.
eat alone, gotta read. social defense tactic 17  peter, that jacket is foul.  lose your glasses?
hi, adele.
brrr.  it is colder than new hampshire in here.
I am sure you kept warm.
sexual tension...
oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
do not misquote othello at me. besides, you would have to care about somebody to strangle them.
what is your problem?
I have got no problems.
time to get my bowling ball re drilled.
peter parker, you have no idea what i did this weekend.  or did not do. it is no business of yours either way.
sit down and stop being such a child.
this from a girl who still plays with dolls.
that was not clever.  that was just nasty.
peter, what can i do for you?
an extension on that astronomy paper?  because, uh...
your dog ate it.
actually, i got this spider bite
pretty lame for such a smart kid.
really, professor, i--
fortean phenomena.  anomalies in our so-called reality. weirdness, my boy, and lots of it.
caused by doc ock's experiment?
how much do you know about it?
not a lot.  i saw inside of the science center.  what exactly happened?
only octavius knows for sure.  and last time i spoke to him, he was on the planet whiz-bang.
need any more help?
no, thank you.  I am sure you have got your own problems.
where did you get the clown suit?
like it?
nah.  the big mask was better.
is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
sorry. I am still getting the hang of this.
i see.  so, amazing spider-man-- I will assume that is not your given name--
just call me spidey.
can i get you a snack-- a housefly, maybe?
thanks, i already ate.
I will hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
well...
all right, amazing.  are you quite finished?
just about.  you see, i also have this amazing strength...
so they are airing this tonight?
yup.  oh, here's your check, minus my commission.  solid, solid novelty act.
... a couple a drinks at sardi's?
what?
i asked if you felt like a drink--
no.  no, i-- my aunt and uncle. something is wrong  --  i need to make a phone call.
okay, kid. call me tomorrow.
mr. reiss-- i need a quarter--
i just gave-- yeah, sure.
peter, you are bleeding.
it is fine.  tell me what--
oh, ben gets through everything.
aunt may, what happened?
i was napping on the couch.  there was a voice and a shot.  i woke up. ben was looking at me.
how is he?
he will be fine. they will not tell me anything, but I am sure he will be fine.
are you quite finished?
just about.  see, i also have this amazing strength.
jesus christ.
mm-hmm.
and you let me go on about rosomoff working me too hard?  i feel like a complete idiot.
you are not half the idiot i am, harry.
well, look who is dressing for success.
at least this ensemble does not glow in the dark.
hey, guys.  check it out-- i saw this dud on the tube last night. he is incredibly cool.
i saw him too.  he was silly and obnoxious.
and flash isn't?
be nice.
yeah, take pity on the feeble minded.
no, no, listen. they are tryin' to say he was in cahoots with this killer--
flash, drop it--
-- but they got it all wrong.  any fool can figure it out.  spider-man nailed this guy!
peter-- you took this picture?
let me see.
mistake?  hey, guy, get back here!
hm.  what a lump.
you were the last one to see thorkel.  in octavius' hospital room.
so you have found thorkel?
some of him char-broiled bones. teeth. we ruled out suicide.  any bad blood between him and ock?
octavius was not the murderer type.
but you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
waldos.
right. we have reason to believe he also robbed an armored truck and killed two men. with the waldos.
lieutenant, I have triangulated recent bizarre events-- the bronx, jersey, brooklyn-- all rippling out from--  here.  the e.s.u. science center. octavius' experiment seems to have opened a hole in space-time, drastically changing the interrelation between molecular binding, electromagnetism and gravity--
yeah, that is fascinating, but I am just a fat, dumb cop lookin' for a psycho killer--
there is an infinitely greater danger. if--  listen.  the only thing octavius cares about is repeating his experiment.  to do that, he needs a radioactive catalyst, sl 270.
toxic dumps, huh.
and he will need a cyclotron.  he can not use ours-- he is already destroyed it.  guard every nuclear accelerator on the eastern seaboard.  new haven, long island, two in cambridge--
you sure about all this?
i know him.
of course.
it is a lot of ground to cover. we will try.  funny coincidence, huh?
no such thing as coincidence.  "god does not play dice with the universe."
einstein, right?  we will see ya.
peter-- my condolences.
this photo you took of "spider-man" -
luck.  the right place at the right time.
really.  I would like to speak with him.
i do not think I will be running into him.
you never know.  go get some sleep.
I will try. thanks.
what is in the bag?  garbage?
sort of.  I am returning the-- that outfit that you hated so much. maybe i can get my money back.
oh, do not do it on my account--
no, it was not only you-- it -- it just was not my style.  hey, look-- let's go to lunch.  someplace nice for a change.
this from a man who winces at the cost of a pretzel?
that was then.  I am better since the lobotomy.
-- but at least aunt may's okay now. i really have to stop by the hospital this afternoon.
do you mind if i come too?
i think I would like that.
they keep saying there is nothing i could have done.  that is a lie.  i could have done something.  if only I would paid attention to my feelings.
you are not trained for that.  none of us are... i mean, sometimes i...  okay, let's say you had gone back. what then?  are you bulletproof?
well, no.
so?  the next day I would read, "peter parker murdered," and I would feel...
you would feel what?
listen.  you think you are responsible for everything that happens.  do not flagellate yourself - and do not flatter yourself, either.  you are not the center of the universe. you are just... peter.
am i?  I am not so sure.  i used to be sure of a lot of things.  oh, different things from week to week, but now-- I am not sure of anything anymore.
i know what you mean.  i...
hello.  earth to peter.  are you listening?
unh-huh.  excuse me.  I have got to go.
relax, jameson.  this is business. i know you want photos of me, so I will give your boy parker an exclusive.  on one condition--
i do not submit to blackmail!  the first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as i imagine it, and--
would you cool it already?
police, help!  po-- mmph.
thank you.  now, repeat after me-- spider-man is a good guy. on the side of right, and niceness, and cute baby animals and all that.
frmpph-yrr.
fine.
oh, that?  it will come unstuck in a half-hour or so. your mouth needs the rest.  bye.
hmf-hrr?
he left.  i could not believe it-- he just left!  it is as if he is somewhere else... I am only getting a piece of him.
when peter was little, he loved to hide.  in closets, under the sink. he needed a secret place.  but when I would look for him, he would laugh... he wanted to be found.
i do not think he wants me to find him.
maybe i was hiding.  for years, i never told ben the one important thing.
he knew.
some things you should say anyway.
even if they are not clever.
even if you have heard them a million times in every stupid pop song ever written.
what if you get hurt?
what if the world ends tomorrow?
i sent for  the police.  we can explain.
explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
right.  let's go.
you are sure you are all right.
yeah, just a lung full of new jersey.  lucky you showed up when you did.
logic.  lot 49 is the closest stockpile of sl 270--  i do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
imagine how i feel.
excuse me if I am impertinent, but-- how did you become whatever it is you are?
the usual.  heredity and environment.  what is the deal with doc ock?
he will try to finish his experiment.
and blow up the universe just to prove he is right?  bit egotistical, is not it?
a messianic complex is nothing new to octavius. in  his universe, there is only one mind-- his own. it must be very lonely.
forgive me if i do not feel too sympathetic right now.
i listened to him talk of eternal truth and thought of the bhagavad gita, the indian holy book-- "i am become shiva, death-- the destroyer of worlds."  octavius was...
bonkers.
loonytunes.  and yet...
just drop me off here.
do you... live around here?
no, but I have got this secret identity to worry about. I will swing the rest of the way.
i see.  well, octavius will not get much further. they will catch him and... put him away.  sad.  he might very well have the truth.
phooey on that.
you get mugged or something?
listen, i do appreciate your concern, but--
i got you a present.
flash, get lost.
come on, laughter's the best medicine!
I am sorry about being a jerk this afternoon.
just shut up and close your eyes. this'll hurt.
may's much better. she will be out soon.
oh, god, i forgot to--
ssh.  i always thought she was a strong person.  she is-- but not for the reasons i thought.
strong...
her cleverness, that hard edge-- maybe they are the weakest part of her. the strong part is what is underneath.  the part she was protecting.  there is no reason to protect it... i think she is just finding that out now.
peter?
I am here...
yeah, roz.
any sign of our friend?
nope.  maybe he skipped to rio. feds got troops surrounding every cyclotron on the continent.  are you absolutely positive that one at e.s.u. is kaput?
roz? rosomoff?  what is it?
precise equipment such as waldos
my god, otto, you have to hear me! the world we know will collapse! everything we have devoted our lives to-- all patterns, all harmonies-- will be destroyed!
truth.  truth alone exists. truth must be released...
you have no right!  this is cosmic suicide!
spider-man, be careful!  he is quite mad.
I am not so happy myself.
professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
sure, in the war.  pull those cables--
up here, docky ocky!
no, no!  not there!
i was there.
see?
or was it all a dream?
oh, i need your notes from the classes i missed.
well, I have missed a lot of classes myself...
oh. well, hang in there, amigo.
the paper, my boy.  a solid b-plus.
oh. yeah.  thanks.
if you really apply yourself, you will get an a next time.
hello, liz.
hello.  so very boring.  peter parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
i... i like you.  a lot.
hm.  well, i like you, too.  i like your aunt.  i like your shoelaces. i like--
hold it.  can we stop being clever, just for a moment?
why?
this may be the end of a beautiful friendship, you know.
nah.
