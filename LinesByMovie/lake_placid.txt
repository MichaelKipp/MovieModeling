kelly.
kevin, hey.
hi.  listen.  could i steal you a second?
absolutely.
i had a great time last night. again.
me too.
that is not what you came to say.
you work for me.  I am not comfortable with-- y'know, "us"...
i was working for you when "us" started, what's--
i know and i thought i could handle it but work and pleasure along with somebody else, it is a dangerous mix.
kevin, as long as we...  what was that last part?
the somebody else part?
yeah, that part.  there's... somebody who is um...
else.
oh.  oh.  that is okay.  well.  this uh... this probably was not meant to be, y'know.  i mean, i'm... god, i got to be ten years younger and you, you... you are y'know...
a jerk.
oh...  no, no, I am not angry I am not, I am just thrown, i'm...  i actually have an early lunch, so...
it is ten after nine.
yes, well...  famished.
what do you expect, mugging me from behind?
i tapped you.
well you shouldn't have.  how did you even know where i was.
wild guess.
i do not like to be scared, myra, i have a thing about fright, do not ever scare me.
kevin told me you were upset.
really?  i never realized he was so psychic, how could he detect that, did he tell you there is somebody else?
well... he did not have to tell me that part.
you?
it started before you, kelly, i never would've--
you?
it was just a quick thing which we thought was over, and and...
you and kevin.
it was not suppose to happen, i do not know what to say...
you do not know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
kelly--
I am not upset, myra, okay.  i just never thought of you as a y'know...
backstabber?
no.
liar?
myra.
shitbutt?
i really... i should get back.
hey.
kevin.  how is it going, what is happenin', family good, great, nice to catch up, get out.
this is business.  there was an accident in maine, some guy got killed by something in a lake.  probably a bear, but... they found a tooth.
a tooth?
a tooth they say could not have come from any bear.  they say it looks prehistoric.  like maybe a dinosaur.
oh, well then I am sure that is it, he got killed by a dinosaur, anything else?
i want you to go there.
sorry?
I am sure it is nothing, but you are a paleontologist, this is what we do, i--
this is what we do?
I would like you to check out this lake.  see--
are you on drugs?
kelly--
I am not going to maine, i will not even go west of forty-third street--
part of our research--
I am not even a field person.
well on this one I would like you to be.
this was myra's idea, was not it? get me out of the office for a few days, until--
it has nothing to do with--
i never do field work and even if i did, maine, to look at a tooth of a dinosaur who bit somebody, could not you dream up something--
kelly--
i am not going to maine.  that is ridiculous.
he just came up screaming.
did he say anything?
he just kinda gurgled.  he was pretty much dead.
and you did not see anything?
the lake was dead calm until up he came.  the tooth is in there.
there?  that is the morgue.
yes.
is the dead guy in there?
that is where they keep them.  you want me to bring the tooth out here?
um.  no, no.  let's go.
i wouldn't.
I am fine, thank you.
have you ever seen a dead body before, ms. scott?
well.  at wakes.
this is a little different.
i can look at dead things.
this... how long did this attack go on for?
seconds.  three, four.
and this is how he came to the boat?
yes.
okay.  and is there a place nearby i could go to vomit?
nobody lives within twenty-five miles, 'cept some old couple who live right on the lake.  teenagers trek in every once in a while, none have disappeared, and none have spotted anything unusual.
you talk to the married couple?
not yet.
what kind of backup do we have?
we?
what?
sorry.  I am just a little unclear as to why the museum of natural history would send somebody here.
you have a thing against museums?
i got nothing against--
ever even been in one?
what is that?
lightweight forward area air device unit.  whatever's out there, one shot with this and he is dead.
and you stock these things for what, to fend off russia?
you are sort of a rude person.
it is just that--
we set?
ready.  a museum in new york sent us some additional back up.
kelly scott.
jack wells.  a museum sent you?
are we all museum bigots in maine?
did you make anything of the tooth?
yes, it did seem prehistoric but I am sure he just carried the thing for luck.  not that it worked, obviously.  it probably somehow got lodged into his body.
I am ready when you are.
let's go.
excuse me.  one other thing, it is a small point, but... i have a thing about being humored, and I am feeling humored, more by him, but you seemed quick to join in.
ma'am, your first impression is not going well.
oh, my husband passed away almost two years ago.
my department does not have any record of that, mrs. bickerman.
oh well, I am sorry.  i did not realize you keep such a firm track of the dead.
we do not mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
was he swallowed?
sheriff.
mrs. bickerman, the reason we are up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  do you know how your husband died?
oh yes.  i killed him.
you killed him.
oh, yes.
and how would you have accomplished this, ma'am?
well, he was very ill and he refused to go see a doctor and well... i think he had alzheimer's, he would be coherent one day, incoherent the next and one coherent day, he asked me to end his suffering.  i would not do it but he kept insisting and insisting and deteriorating till the point the only cognitive thing he could really do was that i finish him off.  finally i just gave in and hit him on the head with a skillet then buried him under the bulkhead.
half mile up, there is a clearing.
you going to dig up that lady's husband?
I will call the coroner.
what is with this lake?  it looks black and... there are no waves or anything.
they wanted to call it lake placid. but somebody said that name was taken.
gee.
the tents were sent ahead, they should already be set-up.
we are staying in tents?
i told you.  two days, we would have to camp.
yes, camp, i thought that meant holiday inn, i never heard "tents", will there be toilets?
what the hell?
what?
i thought i saw...
it looks like a branch.
hey!!
you threw it at me!!
i just let go of it.
how big do the bears get?
big but... a bear could not do that to a moose or man in water.  on land maybe.  but...
and they are sure he did not get tangled under the outboard somehow?
hank says he is sure.
it really is beautiful, is not it?
never been to maine before?
i was told they discriminate against people with hygiene.  i never believed it.
why are you here?  really.
i told you.
the museum of natural history does not send out investigators to--
how would you know, what--
and even if they did, i doubt he or she would have problems with tents.
so i do not like tents, why--
you do not like tents, mosquitos, look at your fingernails, you have about as much business being in the woods--
I am not making it up.
well.  you do not have to stay out here, why don't--
I have come, I am here, I am staying. unless there are ticks.
oh my god.
what?
if this is who i think it is.  it is.
who?
hector cyr.  he is a rich kook mythology professor.  he is done some work with our museum.  he also treks the world to swim with crocodiles.
with what?
crocodiles.  he is an expert on them.  and if he is here... then he must think that is what is in this lake.
in maine?
there have been northern sightings. but not this north.
--who is he?
I will need any and all topographic studies.
wait just a second.  you do not just fly in here and start barking orders.
i apologize, i just do not want to lose the light, we have got time for a quick scout,  you have had work done.
they have been migrating north, kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
mr. cyr!
c'mon, we are losing light,  why does the big one heckle me?
hector.  the big one has no sense of humor.  and since he's the one who decides whether you get to play, try not to be your obnoxious self.
that hurt my feelings.
if he is here, I will find him.  did she tell you we had sex together?
i never had sex with you!
even so, you are allowed to boast. you look thin by the way, I have mentally undressed you, i can see your ribcage.
i really do not mean to be discourteous.  but how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in new england?
they have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it is only a matter of time.
and what would he do come winter?
they can survive winter.  as long as their nostrils do not freeze, they survive,  am i foolish to explain things, he had such trouble with my name?
around here.  yeah.
if he is eaten in the area, he should not be far away.  crocs hang around the food source.
but they are nighttime hunters, hector, he would probably be on land now anyway.
'cept he was not before, was he?  you know, when friends or family members say things, they tend not to register so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger. you are fat.
hector.
what is that?
white perch.
are they feeding?
does not look like it.
they look like they are jumping.
none of us actually saw anything.  i realize this sir, but something flipped us over, i doubt very much it was a mink.
what is going on?
they do not believe her.
thank you, it is so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you fucker.
such the flirt.
u.s. wildlife will not send anybody without a confirmation.
same thing from fish and game.
something's in that water.
well until we see it, we are not going to be convincing too many people.
we would only just met.
well, you have got a croc alright, they are keystone species.
keystone what?
species, keystones affect the entire ecosystem, that could explain all these worms, the water. you have got a crocodile.  bury your friend.
baby crocs?
adult males will charge hatchlings. if there is one out there...
if one could be out there... why does fish and game tell me it is impossible?
because they just consult their little indigenous charts.
he could be right there and you would not see him.
I would be able to see something.
you are a beautiful woman.
thank you.
and law enforcement, such dangerous work.  the idea that you could die suddenly with no offspring, disconcerting, let's mate, commit your genes to perpetuity.
we are here on official business.
cocktail?
no!!  what is with digging the holes?
they come on land and they are brazen.  they are also attracted to noise, you can see i make a lot of it.
everybody out, back to your tents, now!
could she stay, we have tentatively scheduled intercourse.
no!!  out!
you listen to me.  the only reason I am letting you be part of this is 'cause you got the helicopter and the radar--
and you like me.
i do not like you.
deep down, gut check.  I am growing fond of you and it is liberating to say so.
what are you doing?
skipping stones.  look how flat that water is, you can get ten skips on a good one.
listen, uh... hank and i think it best if you stay on shore.
i beg your pardon?
whatever's out there did flip over a canoe--
i am not staying on shore.
it is too dangerous for--
i did not fly up here to roast marshmallows--
you flew up here because your boss--
i am going out on that boat and why are you picking on me, is this some kind of--
that was an awful thing to say to me.
I am sorry but you're...
okay.  we are up at six.
good.
'night.
jesus christ!!
what the hell are you doing?!!
what are you doing?!
you are crawling around like a--
I am laying a spring trap!
a spring trap!
i keep telling you, they can come on land, i do not wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
i coulda shot you, you--
this could end up saving your life,--
you hurt his feelings.  i think you should go apologize.
apologize?
he thinks they are what?
in his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them. he is a mythology professor, he thinks crocs are divine conduits.
is this 'spose to make me take him more serious?
it is to make you understand him, with understanding comes tolerance. too bad they do not put proverbs in twinkies, my load would be lighter.
why does everybody insult my intelligence, i have intelligence, intelligent people eat twinkies.
I am sorry.
again, i do not mean to be annoying with my questions.  but if it is a crocodile which i do not think it is.  and if they do charge these baby hatchling sounds...  why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?  with you it makes sense.
they do not really attack underwater and--
that "walt" guy got hit underwater--
no crocodile has ever--
you should take a flax pole.
and what if i tranq him kelly?  he drowns.  you think about that?
I am just saying last resort.
again.  not to be disruptive.  do we have a problem with it dying?
crocodiles do not sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.
is this a trick?
what I am saying is if it is a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.
they respond pretty quick.  I will wait till you get down before i turn it on.
good.  see ya soon.
good luck.
two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, I am still waiting on his sperm count.
what?  oh as if I am interested.
as if.  will you miss me?
i brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
no thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
was that like a homo-sexual remark?
i asked you to be nice to him.
he may be a kook but he is also been all over the world with them.  he even swam in the grimetti with killer niles all around him, he never got nipped.
and that is why he thinks they are godly?
he said he knew it when he looked into their eyes.
you like jack?
what?  i do not even know the guy.
hector thinks you like him.
well hector's a giant cracker.
you think jack's handsome?
what is this?
I am just curious.  i can never tell what women think is handsome.  is he handsome?
well.  he is probably rugged handsome i guess.  yeah.
hector, jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you are on the last tank. time to go home.
that was a bust.
what was that?
i do not know.  it was like a tug. something tugged us.
are you alright?
i think.  my hair.  where is hector?!  where is he?
you okay?  kelly?
yeah.  nobody saw anything?
no.  u.s. wildlife is on their way.
that is probably good.
police want to keep it quiet, if the press gets word... lake monster.  they just want us to sit tight.
are you okay?
um... y'know...  yeah.
was he a good man?
yup.
whenever somebody dies i consider it such a waste that i did not know him better.
his head was just... bitten off.
i used to have this recurring nightmare that i was headless.
this is a setback.
you do not want to cut me down. 'cause I will kill you.
hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
i thought i might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
you know they say the brain confuses fear for passion.
excuse me?
when you get scared, the brain releases a chemical, same chemical it releases when somebody's...  in high school, the thing to do was to take the girl to a scary movie.
what are you talking about?
I am saying between the moonlight, a beautiful lake and a monster that bites heads off... you look good.
gee, that was so poetic, jack.  I am all moist.
forgive me for trying to be nice.
nice?  nice would be "you look pretty," nice is not some man- eating monster has tricked my brain into making you look good.
i did not say it like that.
you did, you--
i was trying to pay you a compliment, i was guising it as science 'cause i know you are comfortable in that arena. science.
a man just died, you are hitting on me with science.
just forget it.
hank?
yes.
are you okay?
other than feeling slightly embarrassed, I am perfectly fine.  could you cut me down?
promise you will not kill me, first.
i have no interest in ever looking at you, hector.  could you please cut me down?
he was an indo-pacific.
are you sure?
scales were oval.  it was an asian crocodile.
asia?  how... how could he get here?
obviously some asshole in hong kong flushed him down a toilet.
hank.  the little cannon you brought, get it.  guard the shoreline.  otherwise, we are done. we made the i.d., our job is finished.
alright, ms. paleontologist.  i wanna know why that monster is here.  you got a theory?
why he is that big, i do not know. why he is here... the wetlands are being developed, crocodiles are moving.  australia, fiji, the things have started to cross oceans.
but why maine and why alone?  crocs are social, why is this guy on the move by himself?
maybe he does not play well with others.
is everything a big fucking joke to you?
bite my bishop.
hank!
he said he knew karate!
at school they would always say "go" first.
get your big gun and guard the shore.  hector.  go to your tent.
he never said "go".
get the gun.
like little children.  you okay?
yeah.  i got some stuff for your cut.
i could not believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
i wonder if he is some kind of mutant.  that bear had to be surprised.
let's get away from the shore.
sorry.
it is okay.
ow.  shit.
just gotta pull it a little tighter.
who taught you be be a nurse?
father's a surgeon.  i can even stitch in a pinch, would not be a bad idea here.
no thanks.
keep it dry.  no swimming.
thank you.
you are having the best time of your life, are not you?
what?  why... people have been killed, i hardly think I am having a good time, why would...  does it show?
that is why you are here.  to get in the middle of something?
maybe.  I have always read about what is happened.  I have never... i know it sounds silly but, it is nice to be someplace while something is actually... y'know... happening.
thanks for the... bandaid.
night.
what is that?
it came from across the lake.
you said nobody came in here!
obviously i was wrong!
just spit him back out.  some shall live, some shall die, arbitrarily, sound like any higher power we know?
he did not eat the kid cause he would just swallowed a bear.
sobek.  half man, half croc, oldest god--
I am tired, hector.  i know this because you are beginning to not bug me.
that sounds good but underneath it is hurtful.  nightcap?
raincheck.
well.  goodnight.
we seem to say goodnight a lot.
we could not say it and...  well, that thing is ambulatory if you want somebody in your tent to...
get back from the shore.  we know how fast he can leap out.
we should not even really be doing this.
they will not be here till at least noon.  we got a few hours to kill.
so does he.
I am going to get ticks.  i know it. they are drawn to me.  i got a thing about ticks.
ssssh!
what?
i heard something.
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
look.
it seems like we are getting lower.
it happens when i land.
why are we landing?
'cause this is the cove he obviously lives in.
so why are we landing?  hector.
thing we can lift it?
maybe.  do not mush it.
I am not mushing it.
you are mushing it a little around the--
i'm not mushing it.
okay.  okay.  okay.
that is it!!
really--
no.  i keep getting hit with heads!
calm down.
you calm down!
calm down.
now I am going to puke.
you gotta be kidding.
what?
look.
what is she doing now?  mother of god.
what?
look ten feet into the water.
i have not broken any laws.
oh, but you have, ma'am.  you lied to us, that could be obstruction of justice.  a man's been killed in part 'cause of your silence, i could make out a charge of reckless endangerment and I am sure peta would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.
the reason i lied is if I would told you the truth, you would just hunt it down and kill it which seems to be exactly what you are doing.
he just appeared.  you have no idea how he arrived in this lake?
no.  do you?
ma'am.  your husband, bernie.  you didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?
no, i did not.  the crocodile did kill him, though. but it was all... it was a mistake.
ma'am, how could you not report this?  he puts human life at risk and--
nobody lives on this lake.  it is really his lake now.
c'mon hector.  i know you are crazy but you can't--
i need to see his habitat.
please.  I will have sex with you, anything, but get out of the water.
he is not going to hurt me.
murders and rapes in the cities. people bomb planes... can the police stop them?  no.  but feed one little cow to a crocodile...
you are to wait right here until the police show, you are under full house arrest.
thank you, officer fuckmeat.
i might get a shot.
no.  if you do not kill him instantly, I am dead and you will only kill him instantly if you get his brain, which is about the size of a cherry.  and even if you were on target, a bullet might not penetrate his hide.
jesus.  about twelve more yards.  keep coming just like that.
go!!!
i'm trying!!!
this time, i'm going to kick your ass.
bastard bit my chopper.
hey!!
you wanna kill yourself, that it, you looking to commit some kind of divine suicide?
alright, jack!
no!  you might think they are godly, you might get some spiritual lift backstrokin' with dragons but you just put a deputy at risk and--
let's not overlook he did not eat me, maybe--
'cause he just ate a cow, you stupid--
jack!
I am a civilian!  you do not have any authority--
i can arrest you!!
then do it!!
you probably do want to be killed by it, that was you trying to meet your maker.
so profound and fat.
did you want to be killed by it?
you think I am that nuts?
hector.  what you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
nothing's real.
excuse me?
nothing's real.  I am rich, people are automatically my friends, sycophants ooze out like oil slicks and and and--
with crocodiles... everything's even.
I am no psychiatrist.  but i would think there have to be better places to look for autonomy, than--
I am an empty man, kelly, wealth has robbed me of the dream in life, i sit here broken, a hollow sack--
oh, bullshit.
did not even sound good?
no.
eh.  fuck it.
can i tell them you will not go back in the water?
yes.  you may.  but maybe... i do not know...
what?
could we have intercourse?
just heard from wildlife and florida fish and game.  they should be here by four.
okay.
we might as well pack.
good idea.
they are not going to be able to snag him in pitmans.  tranq him in water, he drowns.
they could try to tranq him on land.
they won't.  he is taken human life, the mission will be to put him down.
gee, that would really disappoint me.
forget about him being god, he is thirty feet long, he is a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to maine.  this is a grand beast. a grand dragon.  an attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
well, you can try talking them into that, if--
i have enough flaxedil with me to put him out.  and i think i know a way to--
forget it.
look.  i know I am crazy, but when they come, they will kill it.  they have to, politically, he is too dangerous, if something were to go wrong... the odds are he will be destroyed,--
and how would we neutralize him?
we lure him on land and pump him with the drugs.
no way.
jack.  we have all seen it.  he is probably a hundred and fifty years old, he is bigger than an elephant.
so maybe wildlife will try to save him, they are more equipped to--
we both know what they will do.
even if we could tranq him-- how would we get him on land.
other than to eat us?
and again.  how would you get him on land?
that is actually the easy part.
I will sue you.
go ahead.
you can not take a cow by eminent domain.
we will not let him get hurt, ma'am.
you are all fuckers.  vicious little fuckers.
are we crazy?
well...
we have got a cow hanging from a helicopter.
keep enough tension to hold him up, hector, we do not know if he can swim.
right.
the more he thrashes, the better.
you ready on shore?
we are ready.
it can not work.
he has been going after everything. it could work.  but this is not a happy cow.
he looks like a giant tea bag.
he does not seem to be swimming.  is he swimming?
he is floating.  take it home.
hector.
i got something on the screen.
you do?
where?  where?
thirty meters or so.  moving slow, but straight toward elsie.
can you confirm visually or just radar?
radar, he is underwater.  but he is definitely coming.
okay.  lead him in.  okay, everybody up on the trucks. we aim for the stomach or side... there is little chance the darts will pierce his hide.  everybody up on the trucks.
if he gets close, you go up, hector, do not you endanger that cow.
she is worried about the cow now.
he is mooing.
you wouldn't?
they are coming right in.
such a simple idea and it is working.  what does that tell you?
that it is about to go wrong.
almost here, hector.  do not forget to lift up the cow.
thank you, jack.
you shoot on my order.  if he charges, I will be yelling "go" which means drivers take off.  and drive fast, they can move on land.  you set?
watch out!!
keep firing!
hector!!
take him.
i can't.  I will get hector!!
where is he?!
we gotta get to hector!!
back us in a little, we need to get a shot!
where is he?
tranq guns down, rifles up!
if you get a safe shot...
I will take it!
hector.  do not move.
did you get him?
i do not know.  back the truck--
no!
i just have this feeling everything's totally safe.
i see blood.  maybe you got him, hank.
where is he?!
i do not know!
should i?
wait.
he is through fighting.  look at him.
i do not care.  hank.  end it.
no.  look.  he is got nothing left.
yeah and every time we think there is no more danger--
I am okay.
you are not okay, your leg's a mess.
get him onto shore.
he heeds a tourniquet.
you are going to be okay.
guess i finally got bit.
yeah, you got bit.  I am going to fix it.
he is done.  he is dying.
do not count on it.  we better take him out.
he is going to live?
yeah.  thanks to you.
and hank.  i know you were not really trying to hit him.
you take care.
you talk to bickerman?
she did not tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we would blow it is head off.
women's intuition.  are there anymore?
just those two.
thanks for your help.
you too.
I am sure this would offend you on principal but... could we keep in touch?
i guess.
well...
you wanna ride in my truck?
you sure?  i do not mind...
no, i actually want to stay for a little while.
if I am ever in new york...
yeah.
y'know, if we did not live in separate worlds and...
but we do.  hey, we will always have maine.
it was... something meeting you.
likewise.
different worlds, jack.
yeah, i thought about that as i was driving... and... i have not found somebody in my world.  you found anyone in yours?
no.
so i was thinking... maybe if i met anybody in my world who was good for you and if you know somebody in new york good for me, we could fix each other up.
you think?
worth a try.  we do not wanna be alone forever, do we?
probably not.
that was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I will be able to tell him if you can.
good thinking.
