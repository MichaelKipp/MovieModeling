it is one of these.
we are going to freeze to death.
o.k. o.k.
maybe somebody changed the lock.
like who?
just a thought --
ah!
it smells damp.
it is just been empty a while.
how long since you were here?
the best part of ten years.
why did not he want to sell it?
i do not know. probably wanted a hideaway.
not exactly modern.
we will sell it. sell everything.
i thought half of it was your brother's?
he will not complain. he can pay off some of his creditors.
you know we have to let kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. she will love it.
you mean we are moving in?
you are still blaming me.
no. I am not.
you wanted to come back to london. we came back.
all right.
so what is the argument?
no argument.
oh christ. julia...
larry!
i hear you.
where are you?
in here.
he is here?
he is been here. there is stuff in the kitchen. he must have made a hasty exit.
who is there?
daddy?
kirsty?
i got through.
where are you?
i found a room.
what did you say?
i said: i found a room.
i thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
no dad.
you would like the house.
you would like my room.
do you want me to come over?
well i want you to see the house.
I am not going to change my mind, dad.
great.
well come over, will you? see the place?
maybe later in the week. first I have got to find myself a job.
what for, honey? you know we can look after you. you have made the gesture --
it is not a gesture. i want to do this on my own. come on, trust me a little will you?
i do. I would just feel happier if you were with us.
I will come over and see you in the next few days. you can show me the mansion. o.k.?
you will keep in touch.
of course. every day.
o.k.
take care, dad.
call me tomorrow.
i will. see you.
well?
why not?
we will move in sunday.
wait! wait! watch the fucking paint work.
look, do you want the bed in or not?
just take it slowly.
oh, sod you.
eh, chas, slow it down like the man says.
it will go in.
alright, let's give it another try.
do you really need this bed, lady?
how are you doing through there?
it looks like a bomb's dropped.
it is my lucky day.
hi.
want to buy a bed?
not much.
big house.
you like?
me like.
I will show you around when we have got this damn bed moved.
is julia here?
upstairs.  treat her gently, huh? she hates moving.
surprise.
kirsty.
o.k. I will be nice. you get on with the muscle work. I will make myself some coffee.
kitchen's through on your left.
that your daughter?
uh-huh.
got her mother's looks.
her mother's dead.
oh.
julia's my second wife.
lucky man.
damn right. now are we going to move the bed or not?
are you o.k.?
sure.
you are julia, right?
that is right. who are you?
I am brother frank.
oh.
i came for the wedding.
there is going to be a wedding?
oh.  oh yes.
well can i come in or not?
I am sorry. of course. you are very welcome.
kirsty.
hi. i got soaked.
there is a towel in the bathroom.
which is where?
just to your left.
well?
i do not want to see the dress.
but you said --
i do not want to see the dress.
what about larry --
forget him.
christ!
what is the problem?
my fucking hand!
you fucking ass-holes.
who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? it is this bastard bed that is your fucking problem!
what is happening?
we are leaving.
where is my father?
will you sign for the bed?
sure.
what have you done?
i cut myself.
is it deep?
i do not know, i have not looked. you know me and blood.
you are not going to faint.
shit.
let me see.
it is probably going to need stitches.
I am going to throw up.
no, you are not.
take it slowly.
so damn stupid.
you are done worse.
I will be scarred for life.
no you won't.
what happened?
just an accident. he is all right. will you drive? he needs stitches.
sure.
the keys are in the kitchen.
look, I am going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
larry....
anyway, it is bad luck to see too much of the bride before the wedding.
wedded bliss?
I am very happy.
sure you are.
what are you drinking, love?
I have forgotten.
steve?
we are on the cointreau.
that is right. cointreau.
i will not be able to stand.
so lie down.
would you excuse me? i think I am going to go to bed.
are you o.k.?
julia.
oh my god.
do not look at me.
who are you?
i said: do not look.
help me.
tell me who you are.
frank.
no. god no.
believe me. it is me. it is really me.
what happened to you?
his blood... on the floor... it brought me back.
back from where?
just help, will you? please god, help me --
you are not going?
just upstairs.
need any help?
i am house-trained.
...somebody...
ssh!
you can not let me stay like this. please. you can't.
what do you want me to do.
the blood brought me this far. i need more of the same. or I will slip back...
I am here.
i thought we would lost you.
I am coming!  sleep well.
you know i do know the way home.
it is late.
not that late.
please. i want to see you home. all right?
all right.  no. that is nice.
if there is a train.
what do we do if there isn't?
we walk.
why do not you stay at larry's house? there is plenty of room.
yeah, there is room. and there is julia.
i see.
she is so damn... english.
meaning what?
oh, i do not know. up-tight. frigid.
i beg your pardon?
there ya go.  i beg your pardon?
we are not all frigid.
oh no?
oh no.
it is not what i heard.
well you have just been talking to the wrong people.
oh!
are you alright ?
I have been better.
your father told me you were working here.
if i make it through the day.
I am sorry, i should not have surprised you.
no, it is good to see you.
are you busy after work ?
just trying to get my apartment in order.
can i lend you a hand?
as long as you do not mind the smell of fur --
it is a fetish of mine.
not much fun, is it?
what?
drinking alone.
not much.
i wonder, maybe...
what are you drinking?
just soda.
plain soda?
please.
i try not to drink at lunch-time. makes me sleepy in the afternoon. you like to keep a clear head, eh?  one soda, one whisky.  i do it anyway. no will-power. got a busy afternoon?
that depends.
oh?
you know it is not often i... you know...
there is a first time for everything.
i suppose that is right.
you want something to drink?
I am already way over my usual limit. you know, it is funny. i feel like I have known you for years.
well, is not it?
i... suppose so, yes.
so, what is your problem? let's get to it.  you are not going to change your fucking mind ?
no. no. let's go upstairs.
that is more like it.
is this your place ?
do you care ?
no, not much.
let's keep it that way, shall we?
no personal details?
that is right.
this is not the bedroom.
no.
what is going on?
we do not need a bed, do we?
i suppose not.
i prefer the floor.
first time for everything.
that is right.
why do not you take off your jacket? you are warm.
yeah, why do not i?
why do not you do the same?
maybe i will.
you know, you are very beautiful.
am i?
you know you are. loveliest woman i ever set eyes on.
oh christ.
what is wrong?
too much drink. better empty my bladder.
julia?
I am here.
sweetheart... I have been calling you.
are you all right?
just feeling a bit sick.
oh, babe...
I will be o.k. just leave me be a while.
can i get you anything?
maybe a brandy.
sure.
I will be down in a minute
o.k.
I am hurting
hurting.
my nerves... are beginning to work again.
good.
one more. maybe two --
-- to heal me completely. then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
who?
the cenobites. it is only a matter of time before they find I have slipped them. i have to get away from here.
just a moment. put on some music will you babe?
o.k.
poor larry. obedient as ever.
keep your voice down.
ssh. do not want babe to hear.
you are hurting.
you will not cheat me will you? you will stay with me. help me. then we can be together, the way we were before. we belong to each other now, for better or worse...
i just wanted to be sure you were o.k.
never better. you sleep well.
yeah.
i love you, honey.
i love you too.
who was it?
kirsty.
well?
better. very much better. I would like something to wear. and some cigarettes. will you bring me some?
later.
what?
i want an explanation first. i want to know what happened to you.
not know.
tell me, damn you.
a long time.
you promised me an explanation.
this is what began it.
a box?
it is not any box. it is called the lament configuration. it is a puzzle.
let me see.
do not touch it. it is dangerous. it opens doors.
what kind of doors?
to experience beyond anything ever known. at least that is what i was promised when i bought it. pleasure from heaven or hell. i did not much care which.
hell...
i was bored. I would done everything. I would gone to the limits. there was nothing left to experience. at least nothing i could buy on earth.
and you came back here to solve the puzzle --
sure. somewhere safe.  safe. christ! they tortured me here. in this room.
who did?
the cenobites. the creatures the box set free.  sometimes i think they are still here. just behind the walls. them and their hooks and their beasts. just waiting to break out again. except that I have got the box.
you are still afraid.
you would be. they tore me apart.
so you were cheated.
no. they gave me experiences beyond the limits. pain and pleasure, indivisible.
they took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. in the boards, in the walls. watching the world, but not able to touch it.
and the blood let you out?
it gave me a little chance, and i took it. they will not get me back. I am going to live, and you are going to help me. yes?
yes. they will never find us.
is this upsetting you?
I have seen worse.
are you all right?
fine.
only I will turn it off --
-- I will go see.
no. I will do it.
larry...
what is wrong with you?
oh baby.
do not go upstairs.
come with me then.
huh?
please...
what is wrong with you?
please. i can not bear it...
...maybe we should never have come back.
maybe you should give it some time.
i guess.
she is not like mom. she's... i do not know... moody. i thought that was what you liked about her.
you do not like her at all do you?
she does not even want to leave the house.
really?
it is like she is waiting for something.
what?
i do not know. i do not know. it is beyond me.
would you... maybe call round sometime? try to make friends.
sure.
maybe all she needs is some company.
you can not love him.
i don't.
so where is the harm?
i said no.
then find me somebody else, before they come looking.
julia!
kirsty?
kirsty. it is frank. it is uncle frank.
no.
you remember.
no.
come to daddy.
do not touch me. or so help me --
what? what will you do? what can you do?  there is nothing to be frightened of.
i bet you make your daddy proud, do not you? beautiful.
this is not happening.
i used to tell myself that. used to try and pretend i was dreaming all the pain. but why kid yourself? some things have to be endured. take it from me. and that makes the pleasures so much sweeter...
no.
one last time. give me the box.
you want it?
come to daddy.
this is not happening.
some things have to be endured...
you are awake. good girl.
what happened to me?
I will get the doctor.
wait a moment --
who brought me in here?
i will not be a moment.
please. get back into bed.
i have to speak to my father.
that is easily arranged. but first, back into bed.
it is important.
you took quite a beating. you must lie down.
please listen to me --
first things first. you can have a telephone when we have talked. do you know who did this to you?
you were holding onto it like grim death.
i do not remember.
well the police are going to want to speak to you. you know that.
oh christ.
we will get you a phone as long as you promise to stay put.
she will tell them everything...
i do not think so. she will want larry first.
that is probably her now. or the police.
maybe.
do not you care?
there is very little i can do about it.
maybe we should just leave --
like this? look at me! like this?
well we can not just stay here --
i need a skin. then we leave --
what a pretty tune.
my father does not answer. i have to go find him.
I am afraid you will have to wait until the police have spoken to you. keep trying your father; he will answer eventually.
i called another friend of mine and he is coming over. will you let him in?
of course. this is not a prison you know.  look if you would prefer to tell me what happened, instead of a policeman --
you would not believe me.
try me.
well, if you change your mind. what is this friend's name?
steve.
what is wrong?
i do not know where to begin...
what are you talking about?
it is better you see for yourself --
the box... you opened it. we came.
it is just a puzzle box.
it is a means to summon us -- it is called the lament configuration.
who are you?
cenobites. explorers in the further regions of experience. demons to some. angels to others.
well, i did not mean to open that thing. you can go back wherever you came from.
this is not for real.
you solved the box. we came. now you must come with us. taste our pleasures.
steve. thank god you came.
what happened to you?
these things... they want to take me --
what things?
he does not see us, or hear us. we belong to you, kirsty. and you to us.
no!
what is wrong?
do not let them take me, steve --
i will not let anybody take you.
what?
just go. please. I will be o.k. I am going to go see dad. he will look after me --
what did i say?
will you go, damn you?
I will come back later, huh?
sure. why not?
'bye.
'bye.
let me alone, will you?
no tears please. it is a waste of good suffering.
no time for argument.
you did this before, right?
many times.
to a man called frank cotton?
nobody escapes us.
he did. I have seen him.
suppose he had slipped us. what significance has that?
i could lead you right to him. you could take him back to hell instead of me.
kirsty? it is very late.
where is daddy?
what is the problem?
i have to see my father.
of course. there is no need to shout.
you look terrible. have you had an accident?
i was here this afternoon.
this afternoon.
i saw everything.
I am sorry, i do not follow. what was there to see?
i have to talk to you.
of course.
it is all right, sweetheart. julia's told me everything; and it is all right...
no. you do not understand. your brother -- frank -- he is here in the house. and he is --
whatever frank did was his error. and it is finished with now.
finished?
he is gone.
gone?
dead.
he was insane, baby: a mad dog. i put him out of his misery --
poor frank. he is better off dead.
i do not believe it.
I am afraid it is true.
i want to see.
no you don't.
yes!
show her.
we want the man who did this --
no. that was not the deal.
get the fuck out of here.
what is the problem?
please. you are in danger.
no. it is all over.
it isn't. i know what is going on here, and it is not over --
where are you going?
i have to get out.
no, damn you --
oh my god.
oh my god.
do not mourn him. he was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
you bastard --
poor baby.
bastard.
hush now. it is all right frank's here.
frank --
that is right. this is frank you are talking to, remember? frank.
just in time.
stay the fuck away from me.
we have got such sights to show you --
you can keep them.
