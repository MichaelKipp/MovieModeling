it's one of these.
we're going to freeze to death.
o.k. o.k.
maybe somebody changed the lock.
like who?
just a thought --
ah!
it smells damp.
it's just been empty a while.
how long since you were here?
the best part of ten years.
why didn't he want to sell it?
i don't know. probably wanted a hideaway.
not exactly modern.
we'll sell it. sell everything.
i thought half of it was your brother's?
he won't complain. he can pay off some of his creditors.
you know we have to let kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. she'll love it.
you mean we're moving in?
you're still blaming me.
no. i'm not.
you wanted to come back to london. we came back.
all right.
so what's the argument?
no argument.
oh christ. julia...
larry!
i hear you.
where are you?
in here.
he's here?
he's been here. there's stuff in the kitchen. he must have made a hasty exit.
who's there?
daddy?
kirsty?
i got through.
where are you?
i found a room.
what did you say?
i said: i found a room.
i thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?
no dad.
you'd like the house.
you'd like my room.
do you want me to come over?
well i want you to see the house.
i'm not going to change my mind, dad.
great.
well come over, will you? see the place?
maybe later in the week. first i've got to find myself a job.
what for, honey? you know we can look after you. you've made the gesture --
it's not a gesture. i want to do this on my own. come on, trust me a little will you?
i do. i'd just feel happier if you were with us.
i'll come over and see you in the next few days. you can show me the mansion. o.k.?
you will keep in touch.
of course. every day.
o.k.
take care, dad.
call me tomorrow.
i will. see you.
well?
why not?
we'll move in sunday.
wait! wait! watch the fucking paint work.
look, do you want the bed in or not?
just take it slowly.
oh, sod you.
eh, chas, slow it down like the man says.
it'll go in.
alright, let's give it another try.
do you really need this bed, lady?
how are you doing through there?
it looks like a bomb's dropped.
it's my lucky day.
hi.
want to buy a bed?
not much.
big house.
you like?
me like.
i'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
is julia here?
upstairs.  treat her gently, huh? she hates moving.
surprise.
kirsty.
o.k. i'll be nice. you get on with the muscle work. i'll make myself some coffee.
kitchen's through on your left.
that your daughter?
uh-huh.
got her mother's looks.
her mother's dead.
oh.
julia's my second wife.
lucky man.
damn right. now are we going to move the bed or not?
are you o.k.?
sure.
you're julia, right?
that's right. who are you?
i'm brother frank.
oh.
i came for the wedding.
there is going to be a wedding?
oh.  oh yes.
well can i come in or not?
i'm sorry. of course. you're very welcome.
kirsty.
hi. i got soaked.
there's a towel in the bathroom.
which is where?
just to your left.
well?
i don't want to see the dress.
but you said --
i don't want to see the dress.
what about larry --
forget him.
christ!
what's the problem?
my fucking hand!
you fucking ass-holes.
who are you calling a fucking ass- hole? it's this bastard bed that's your fucking problem!
what's happening?
we're leaving.
where's my father?
will you sign for the bed?
sure.
what have you done?
i cut myself.
is it deep?
i don't know, i haven't looked. you know me and blood.
you're not going to faint.
shit.
let me see.
it's probably going to need stitches.
i'm going to throw up.
no, you're not.
take it slowly.
so damn stupid.
you're done worse.
i'll be scarred for life.
no you won't.
what happened?
just an accident. he's all right. will you drive? he needs stitches.
sure.
the keys are in the kitchen.
look, i'm going to have to leave you guys to keep each other company.
larry....
anyway, it's bad luck to see too much of the bride before the wedding.
wedded bliss?
i'm very happy.
sure you are.
what are you drinking, love?
i've forgotten.
steve?
we're on the cointreau.
that's right. cointreau.
i won't be able to stand.
so lie down.
would you excuse me? i think i'm going to go to bed.
are you o.k.?
julia.
oh my god.
don't look at me.
who are you?
i said: don't look.
help me.
tell me who you are.
frank.
no. god no.
believe me. it's me. it's really me.
what happened to you?
his blood... on the floor... it brought me back.
back from where?
just help, will you? please god, help me --
you're not going?
just upstairs.
need any help?
i am house-trained.
...somebody...
ssh!
you can't let me stay like this. please. you can't.
what do you want me to do.
the blood brought me this far. i need more of the same. or i'll slip back...
i'm here.
i thought we'd lost you.
i'm coming!  sleep well.
you know i do know the way home.
it's late.
not that late.
please. i want to see you home. all right?
all right.  no. that's nice.
if there's a train.
what do we do if there isn't?
we walk.
why don't you stay at larry's house? there's plenty of room.
yeah, there's room. and there's julia.
i see.
she's so damn... english.
meaning what?
oh, i don't know. up-tight. frigid.
i beg your pardon?
there ya go.  i beg your pardon?
we're not all frigid.
oh no?
oh no.
it's not what i heard.
well you've just been talking to the wrong people.
oh!
are you alright ?
i've been better.
your father told me you were working here.
if i make it through the day.
i'm sorry, i shouldn't have surprised you.
no, it's good to see you.
are you busy after work ?
just trying to get my apartment in order.
can i lend you a hand?
as long as you don't mind the smell of fur --
it's a fetish of mine.
not much fun, is it?
what?
drinking alone.
not much.
i wonder, maybe...
what are you drinking?
just soda.
plain soda?
please.
i try not to drink at lunch-time. makes me sleepy in the afternoon. you like to keep a clear head, eh?  one soda, one whisky.  i do it anyway. no will-power. got a busy afternoon?
that depends.
oh?
you know it's not often i... you know...
there's a first time for everything.
i suppose that's right.
you want something to drink?
i'm already way over my usual limit. you know, it's funny. i feel like i've known you for years.
well, isn't it?
i... suppose so, yes.
so, what's your problem? let's get to it.  you're not going to change your fucking mind ?
no. no. let's go upstairs.
that's more like it.
is this your place ?
do you care ?
no, not much.
let's keep it that way, shall we?
no personal details?
that's right.
this isn't the bedroom.
no.
what's going on?
we don't need a bed, do we?
i suppose not.
i prefer the floor.
first time for everything.
that's right.
why don't you take off your jacket? you're warm.
yeah, why don't i?
why don't you do the same?
maybe i will.
you know, you're very beautiful.
am i?
you know you are. loveliest woman i ever set eyes on.
oh christ.
what's wrong?
too much drink. better empty my bladder.
julia?
i'm here.
sweetheart... i've been calling you.
are you all right?
just feeling a bit sick.
oh, babe...
i'll be o.k. just leave me be a while.
can i get you anything?
maybe a brandy.
sure.
i'll be down in a minute
o.k.
i'm hurting
hurting.
my nerves... are beginning to work again.
good.
one more. maybe two --
-- to heal me completely. then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
who?
the cenobites. it's only a matter of time before they find i've slipped them. i have to get away from here.
just a moment. put on some music will you babe?
o.k.
poor larry. obedient as ever.
keep your voice down.
ssh. don't want babe to hear.
you're hurting.
you won't cheat me will you? you'll stay with me. help me. then we can be together, the way we were before. we belong to each other now, for better or worse...
i just wanted to be sure you were o.k.
never better. you sleep well.
yeah.
i love you, honey.
i love you too.
who was it?
kirsty.
well?
better. very much better. i'd like something to wear. and some cigarettes. will you bring me some?
later.
what?
i want an explanation first. i want to know what happened to you.
not know.
tell me, damn you.
a long time.
you promised me an explanation.
this is what began it.
a box?
it's not any box. it's called the lament configuration. it's a puzzle.
let me see.
don't touch it. it's dangerous. it opens doors.
what kind of doors?
to experience beyond anything ever known. at least that's what i was promised when i bought it. pleasure from heaven or hell. i didn't much care which.
hell...
i was bored. i'd done everything. i'd gone to the limits. there was nothing left to experience. at least nothing i could buy on earth.
and you came back here to solve the puzzle --
sure. somewhere safe.  safe. christ! they tortured me here. in this room.
who did?
the cenobites. the creatures the box set free.  sometimes i think they're still here. just behind the walls. them and their hooks and their beasts. just waiting to break out again. except that i've got the box.
you're still afraid.
you would be. they tore me apart.
so you were cheated.
no. they gave me experiences beyond the limits. pain and pleasure, indivisible.
they took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. in the boards, in the walls. watching the world, but not able to touch it.
and the blood let you out?
it gave me a little chance, and i took it. they won't get me back. i'm going to live, and you're going to help me. yes?
yes. they'll never find us.
is this upsetting you?
i've seen worse.
are you all right?
fine.
only i'll turn it off --
-- i'll go see.
no. i'll do it.
larry...
what's wrong with you?
oh baby.
don't go upstairs.
come with me then.
huh?
please...
what's wrong with you?
please. i can't bear it...
...maybe we should never have come back.
maybe you should give it some time.
i guess.
she's not like mom. she's... i don't know... moody. i thought that was what you liked about her.
you don't like her at all do you?
she doesn't even want to leave the house.
really?
it's like she's waiting for something.
what?
i don't know. i don't know. it's beyond me.
would you... maybe call round sometime? try to make friends.
sure.
maybe all she needs is some company.
you can't love him.
i don't.
so where's the harm?
i said no.
then find me somebody else, before they come looking.
julia!
kirsty?
kirsty. it's frank. it's uncle frank.
no.
you remember.
no.
come to daddy.
don't touch me. or so help me --
what? what will you do? what can you do?  there's nothing to be frightened of.
i bet you make your daddy proud, don't you? beautiful.
this isn't happening.
i used to tell myself that. used to try and pretend i was dreaming all the pain. but why kid yourself? some things have to be endured. take it from me. and that makes the pleasures so much sweeter...
no.
one last time. give me the box.
you want it?
come to daddy.
this isn't happening.
some things have to be endured...
you're awake. good girl.
what happened to me?
i'll get the doctor.
wait a moment --
who brought me in here?
i won't be a moment.
please. get back into bed.
i have to speak to my father.
that's easily arranged. but first, back into bed.
it's important.
you took quite a beating. you must lie down.
please listen to me --
first things first. you can have a telephone when we've talked. do you know who did this to you?
you were holding onto it like grim death.
i don't remember.
well the police are going to want to speak to you. you know that.
oh christ.
we'll get you a phone as long as you promise to stay put.
she'll tell them everything...
i don't think so. she'll want larry first.
that's probably her now. or the police.
maybe.
don't you care?
there's very little i can do about it.
maybe we should just leave --
like this? look at me! like this?
well we can't just stay here --
i need a skin. then we leave --
what a pretty tune.
my father doesn't answer. i have to go find him.
i'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
i called another friend of mine and he's coming over. will you let him in?
of course. this isn't a prison you know.  look if you'd prefer to tell me what happened, instead of a policeman --
you wouldn't believe me.
try me.
well, if you change your mind. what's this friend's name?
steve.
what's wrong?
i don't know where to begin...
what are you talking about?
it's better you see for yourself --
the box... you opened it. we came.
it's just a puzzle box.
it's a means to summon us -- it's called the lament configuration.
who are you?
cenobites. explorers in the further regions of experience. demons to some. angels to others.
well, i didn't mean to open that thing. you can go back wherever you came from.
this isn't for real.
you solved the box. we came. now you must come with us. taste our pleasures.
steve. thank god you came.
what happened to you?
these things... they want to take me --
what things?
he doesn't see us, or hear us. we belong to you, kirsty. and you to us.
no!
what's wrong?
don't let them take me, steve --
i won't let anybody take you.
what?
just go. please. i'll be o.k. i'm going to go see dad. he'll look after me --
what did i say?
will you go, damn you?
i'll come back later, huh?
sure. why not?
'bye.
'bye.
let me alone, will you?
no tears please. it's a waste of good suffering.
no time for argument.
you did this before, right?
many times.
to a man called frank cotton?
nobody escapes us.
he did. i've seen him.
suppose he had slipped us. what significance has that?
i could lead you right to him. you could take him back to hell instead of me.
kirsty? it's very late.
where's daddy?
what's the problem?
i have to see my father.
of course. there's no need to shout.
you look terrible. have you had an accident?
i was here this afternoon.
this afternoon.
i saw everything.
i'm sorry, i don't follow. what was there to see?
i have to talk to you.
of course.
it's all right, sweetheart. julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
no. you don't understand. your brother -- frank -- he's here in the house. and he's --
whatever frank did was his error. and it's finished with now.
finished?
he's gone.
gone?
dead.
he was insane, baby: a mad dog. i put him out of his misery --
poor frank. he's better off dead.
i don't believe it.
i'm afraid it's true.
i want to see.
no you don't.
yes!
show her.
we want the man who did this --
no. that wasn't the deal.
get the fuck out of here.
what's the problem?
please. you're in danger.
no. it's all over.
it isn't. i know what's going on here, and it isn't over --
where are you going?
i have to get out.
no, damn you --
oh my god.
oh my god.
don't mourn him. he was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
you bastard --
poor baby.
bastard.
hush now. it's all right frank's here.
frank --
that's right. this is frank you're talking to, remember? frank.
just in time.
stay the fuck away from me.
we've got such sights to show you --
you can keep them.
it's one of these.
we're going to freeze to death.
o.k. o.k.
maybe somebody changed the lock.
like who?
just a thought --
ah!
it smells damp.
it's just been empty a while.

all right.
so what's the argument?
no argument.

don't touch it. it's dangerous. it opens doors.
what kind of doors?
to experience beyond anything ever known. at least that's what i was promised when i bought it. pleasure from heaven or hell. i didn't much care which.
hell...
i was bored. i'd done everything. i'd gone to the limits. there was nothing left to experience. at least nothing i could buy on earth.
and you came back here to solve the puzzle --
sure. somewhere safe.  safe. christ! they tortured me here. in this room.
who did?
the cenobites. the creatures the box set free.  sometimes i think they're still here. just behind the walls. them and their hooks and their beasts. just waiting to break out again. except that i've got the box.
you're still afraid.
you would be. they tore me apart.
so you were cheated.
no. they gave me experiences beyond the limits. pain and pleasure, indivisible.
they took my body, but my spirit... they left that here. in the boards, in the walls. watching the world, but not able to touch it.
and the blood let you out?
it gave me a little chance, and i took it. they won't get me back. i'm going to live, and you're going to help me. yes?
yes. they'll never find us.
is this upsetting you?
i've seen worse.
are you all right?
fine.
only i'll turn it off --
-- i'll go see.
no. i'll do it.
larry...
what's wrong with you?
oh baby.
don't go upstairs.
come with me then.
huh?
please...
what's wrong with you?
please. i can't bear it...
...maybe we should never have come back.
maybe you should give it some time.
i guess.
she's not like mom. she's... i don't know... moody. i thought that was what you liked about her.
you don't like her at all do you?
she doesn't even want to leave the house.
really?
it's like she's waiting for something.
what?
i don't know. i don't know. it's beyond me.
would you... maybe call round sometime? try to make friends.
sure.
maybe all she needs is some company.
you can't love him.
i don't.
so where's the harm?
i said no.
then find me somebody else, before they come looking.
julia!
kirsty?
kirsty. it's frank. it's uncle frank.
no.
you remember.
no.
come to daddy.
don't touch me. or so help me --
what? what will you do? what can you do?  there's nothing to be frightened of.
i bet you make your daddy proud, don't you? beautiful.
this isn't happening.
i used to tell myself that. used to try and pretend i was dreaming all the pain. but why kid yourself? some things have to be endured. take it from me. and that makes the pleasures so much sweeter...
no.
one last time. give me the box.
you want it?
come to daddy.
this isn't happening.
some things have to be endured...
you're awake. good girl.
what happened to me?
i'll get the doctor.
wait a moment --
who brought me in here?
i won't be a moment.
please. get back into bed.
i have to speak to my father.
that's easily arranged. but first, back into bed.
it's important.
you took quite a beating. you must lie down.
please listen to me --
first things first. you can have a telephone when we've talked. do you know who did this to you?
you were holding onto it like grim death.
i don't remember.
well the police are going to want to speak to you. you know that.
oh christ.
we'll get you a phone as long as you promise to stay put.
she'll tell them everything...
i don't think so. she'll want larry first.
that's probably her now. or the police.
maybe.
don't you care?
there's very little i can do about it.
maybe we should just leave --
like this? look at me! like this?
well we can't just stay here --
i need a skin. then we leave --
what a pretty tune.
my father doesn't answer. i have to go find him.
i'm afraid you'll have to wait until the police have spoken to you. keep trying your father; he'll answer eventually.
i called another friend of mine and he's coming over. will you let him in?
of course. this isn't a prison you know.  look if you'd prefer to tell me what happened, instead of a policeman --
you wouldn't believe me.
try me.
well, if you change your mind. what's this friend's name?
steve.
what's wrong?
i don't know where to begin...
what are you talking about?
it's better you see for yourself --
the box... you opened it. we came.
it's just a puzzle box.
it's a means to summon us -- it's called the lament configuration.
who are you?
cenobites. explorers in the further regions of experience. demons to some. angels to others.
well, i didn't mean to open that thing. you can go back wherever you came from.
this isn't for real.
you solved the box. we came. now you must come with us. taste our pleasures.
steve. thank god you came.
what happened to you?
these things... they want to take me --
what things?
he doesn't see us, or hear us. we belong to you, kirsty. and you to us.
no!
what's wrong?
don't let them take me, steve --
i won't let anybody take you.
what?
just go. please. i'll be o.k. i'm going to go see dad. he'll look after me --
what did i say?
will you go, damn you?
i'll come back later, huh?
sure. why not?
'bye.
'bye.
let me alone, will you?
no tears please. it's a waste of good suffering.
no time for argument.
you did this before, right?
many times.
to a man called frank cotton?
nobody escapes us.
he did. i've seen him.
suppose he had slipped us. what significance has that?
i could lead you right to him. you could take him back to hell instead of me.
kirsty? it's very late.
where's daddy?
what's the problem?
i have to see my father.
of course. there's no need to shout.
you look terrible. have you had an accident?
i was here this afternoon.
this afternoon.
i saw everything.
i'm sorry, i don't follow. what was there to see?
i have to talk to you.
of course.
it's all right, sweetheart. julia's told me everything; and it's all right...
no. you don't understand. your brother -- frank -- he's here in the house. and he's --
whatever frank did was his error. and it's finished with now.
finished?
he's gone.
gone?
dead.
he was insane, baby: a mad dog. i put him out of his misery --
poor frank. he's better off dead.
i don't believe it.
i'm afraid it's true.
i want to see.
no you don't.
yes!
show her.
we want the man who did this --
no. that wasn't the deal.
get the fuck out of here.
what's the problem?
please. you're in danger.
no. it's all over.
it isn't. i know what's going on here, and it isn't over --
where are you going?
i have to get out.
no, damn you --
oh my god.
oh my god.
don't mourn him. he was dead long before we laid a finger on him.
you bastard --
poor baby.
bastard.
hush now. it's all right frank's here.
frank --
that's right. this is frank you're talking to, remember? frank.
just in time.
stay the fuck away from me.
we've got such sights to show you --
you can keep them.
