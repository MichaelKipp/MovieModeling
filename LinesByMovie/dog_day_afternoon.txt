this is detective sergeant moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  you do not believe me, I am lookin' you right in the eye. right now, i can see you...
it is the cops.  shit!
how did that happen?
i swear to god... on my salary, I am not going to be any hero...
i took too long.
oh, shit!  i gotta have time to think.
what is it?  did you just barge in here... he does not have plan.  it is all a whim.  'rob a bank!  what not?'
... just give me time to think...
what a fuckin' comedy!  wnew plays all the hits.
listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there?
... but you keep away from the bank or we start throwing bodies out the front door one at a time... you got it?  okay?
you mean that?
what?
... the bodies out the door.
i want him to think that.
but do you mean it?
where is the back door?
it is locked on the inside.  it is through that passageway and to the right.
jenny?
he says he does not know.  why do not you cook whatever's there?
it looks like a whole roast.
honey, send out for kentucky fried chicken.  the baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef.  the bottles are in the fridge.
what guns?
the robbers in the bank.  they got guns?
yeah.  a lot of guns.
well, stay away from them.  do not get close.
oh, yeah, i will...
I will kiss the baby for you.
i love you.
sal, I am sorry about this.  but we can get outta this thing.  there is a way outta this.
are you serious?  about throwin' a body outta here if we have to?
well, i stalled him for a while. when it comes the time, then we will work it out.  okay?
but do you mean in? ... but you just told him that if worse comes to worse...
i want him to think that.
but i want to know what you think.
we will not have to.
I will tell you right now - that I am ready to do it.
now, you -- what is your name?
mulvaney...
you and me are checking the other ways in and out.
let's go to the back door.  how did that guy get to be a guard?
well, they go to guard school.
to what ... learn how to shoot? they do not get a gun.
they make $105 a week to start. they fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  i do not know what they learn, sonny.
you got kids?
i got two kids ... and I would like to see them again.
ah, i know!  you are being very cooperative.  i got no complaint against you whatever; you got bank insurance?
do not ask me questions.  i got connections.  you find out who i am, you are cold meat.
i do not care who you are ...  i just want to get you outta here, safe, right?
what if i take you with me?
if you take anybody, please take me.
they will shoot you; the fucking cops'll shoot you ... they do not give a damn.  in spite of that bank insurance.  you see what they did in attica, they shot everybody, the hostages, prisoners, cops, guards, forty-two people they killed, the innocent with the guilty.
you are just a nice guy, mr. mulvaney. only do not fuck around with me, you know what i mean?
i do not fool around with you.
here comes the fbi.  you men lookin' for protection?  we got all the police right here.
why did not you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street?
okay, you are in there and we are out here.  what do we do now?
i told you -- keep away.  i do not know what we do now.
awright, but i wanna talk to you. first off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
they are okay.
you alone, or you got confederates?
I am not alone.
how many you got in there?
i got sal.
sal?  what is that for?  salvatore?
sal.  he is the killer.  we are vietnam veterans so killing do not mean anything to us, you understand?
right -- got ya.  okay, so there is you -- what is your name?
what do you want to know that for?
give me a name, any name, just so i got somethin' to call you.
call me sonny-boy.
sonny-boy, one word?
one word.  you will not find it in the phone book.
listen, sonny ... can i call you sonny for short?
call me whatever you want.
okay, sonny, i want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what i want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  i want to come over there, without a gun ... and you can frisk me.  so you can see you can trust me.  so we can talk and find a way outta this mess.
i frisk you?
you frisk me.
right -- I am with you, buddy.
I would like just some sign i can trust you too, sonny.  i do not want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  some sight ... right?
sure ... like ... I am not going to shoot you.
how about letting the people out of the bank.  why put them in this position?
they are what is keeping me alive. you think you are dealing with an idiot?  talk to me then.
okay, give us the women.
oh, no ... women is all we got.
you are all one way!  I am bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin' ... give me one of them, anyway ... just one ...
so -- you want me to send one out there ... okay.  I will see what i can do.
he wants one.
dead or alive?
alive.
it is up to you ladies.
howard!
to show that we are negotiating.
all right ... send them the guard.
all right ... let's go.
you got these cops outta here. they are comin' in too close.
come on.  i want you to see something.
you want me to give up, huh?  look, sal's in back with the girls. anything happens to me - one move - and sal gives it to them.  boom boom.  how do i know you will not jump me?
i do not forget about sal and the boom boom room.  i want you to see this.
let sal come out, take a look. what hope you got?  quit while you are ahead.  all you got is attempted robbery.
... armed robbery ...
well, armed, then.  nobody's been hurt.  release the hostages, nobody is going to worry over kidnapping charges, the worst you are going to get is five years -- you can be out in a year.
what?
when I am bein' fucked, i like to be kissed a lot.  who the fuck are you tryin' to con me into some deal?  you are a city cop, where is the fbi?  this is a federal offense, i got kidnapping, armed robbery, they are going to bury me!  you know it, you can not talk for them, you are some flunky pig tryin' to bullshit me.  now god damn it, get somebody in charge here to talk to me!
calm down, you are not ...
calm down... look at this, look at him...!
hey, girls -- i was on television...
what about howard?
what?
the tv ... they want to talk to you ...
why are you doing this?
doing what?
robbing a bank.
i do not know ... it is where they got the money.  i mean, if you want to steal, you go to where they got the money, right?
but i mean, why do you need to steal?  could not you get a job?
get a job doing what?  you got to be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  to join the union, you got to get the job, but you do not get the job without the card.
what about, ah, non-union occupations?
like what?  bank teller?  what do they get paid -  ... they pay one hundred thirty- five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  i got a wife and kids. i can not live on that -- you want to live on that?  what do you make a week?
I am here to talk to you, sonny, not ...
wait a minute ... I am talkin' to you.  I am askin' you a question ...
the audience is interested in you, sonny ... not me.
yeah!  we are hot entertainment, right?  you got me and sal on tv ... we are entertainment you sell, right?
you are news, sonny ...
how much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot?
newsman, not ...
okay, newsman.  how much you make a week?  you are not talkin'.  you payin' me? what have you got for me?  we are givin' you entertainment ... what are you givin' us?
what do you want us to give you? you want to be paid for ...
i do not want to be paid.  I am here with sal and eight other people ... and we are dyin'!  they are going to blow our guts out, man!  you are going to see our brains onna sidewalk! how is that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  you going to help, or you just put it on instead of as the world turns?  we are dyin' here!  what have you got for me?
you could give up.
oh yeah?  give up?  you ever been in prison?
of course not ...
then talk about somethin' you fuckin' know about ...
why the hell did he do that?  what the hell did i do?
i guess he did not appreciate your use of language.  they do not speak that way on television.  it is a rule.  do you realize you have cut off a valuable source of communication?
okay, sal ... what do we do?

i figure maybe we can get the fbi to make a deal ...
what kind of a deal?
maybe we can get outta this thing alive ... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges ...
what do you mean?  you talkin' about coppin a plea?

... because if you are talking about coppin' a plea, I am tellin' you right now, there is no deal ... I am never going back to prison ... we got our own deal already ... do you remember the pact we made?  you and me and jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you going to do ... right?  what did we say?  what did we say!
we would kill ourselves.
does that still go?
we are not there yet.
you see what we are dealing with? they want me to kill all of you!
what now, sonny?
wait a minute ... I have been looking at this all wrong ... let's look at it the other way ...
you realize, sal, that we are going to get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now ... you got to mother or a father? friends?  if we got to be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  any country. just name a country.
wyoming.
wyoming ... that is not out of the country -- that is in the united states ... look, I will be back.
he wanted to kill me!
it is okay, you got a lot of protection.
i want a helicopter to get outa here!  and a jet to take us to...  ... wherever we want to go.  outa the country, so no little jets.  a big one with a bar and a piano lounge.
i do not know, sonny.  i do not know if the helicopters can land in here. I will have to check it out.  i got superiors, unnerstan?  they do not always see eye to eye with me. I will do what i can.
sonny, be reasonable!
i want to see my wife.  i want you to bring her down here.
okay, what do you give me?
what do you want?
the girl hostages.
nothin' doin'.  i give you one hostage when you bring my wife, and one for the helicopter, one for the jet, and the rest can come home on the jet.
I will see what they will do.
jesus christ is coming back and he is really pissed.
yeah, well i do not blame him.
you know, sonny, i used to dope a lot, and i was into dipping?  and i did a couple bank jobs, and the lord jesus in his everlasting mercy saved me, you know how?
no.  look, we are kind of....
that is why i can talk to you, as an equal, sonny.  you got to merge your whole soul with god.  and then you are him and one with the holy ghost.
yeah, well...maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay?
sonny?  do not send me away!  i can help you save your soul ...
where is the air conditioning?
i do not know, sonny ... on the roof somewhere i guess.

do you think we can turn it on?
i do not know.
sonny -
yeah ...
i never been up in a plane before.
it is nothing - it just goes up - it is the safest thing in the world. safer than a car.  do not worry about it, sal - it will be all right ... they are great ...
they are trying to come through the door!
everybody!  back here!
what the hell you doin' back there?
sonny, come on out!
what the fuck do you want?
they were ...
you tryin' to fuck me?
no, I am not tryin' to fuck you.
so, what were they doin'?  you are tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there?
i swear to god i had nothing to do with it ...
bullshit ... i do not walk to talk to you ...
wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
yeah ...
is on its way ... the helicopter can not land but we got a bus ... the jet's on its way to kennedy ... we got a bus coming here ...
you are full of shit ...
sonny, your wife's on the way ... we reached her ... your wife's on the way ... everything you asked for, you got.
well, what were you doin' back there?
it can not happen again ... I will do everything i can to stop anything i can ...
you know, you are telling me that a helicopter can not land here ...
can not land ... you would kill people ...
do not fuck with me ...
I am not ... I am not ... you are gettin' a bus ... you are gettin' a bus ... the jet's comin' into kennedy ... and your wife's on the way ... what else do you need? what else can i get you?  listen, i do not know how you can do better ... see that man over there ... the fbi guy ...
just one more explosion like that and you are going to see a dead body ...
there will not be ... there will not be ... what else do you need?  how else can we help you?
all right ... i got some hungry people in there ... i want to get some pizza ... some stuff like that ...
what else?
cokes, seven-ups ...  also some aspirin ...
aspirins ... okay you got it.  charlie!  six pizzas!
okay ...
okay ... okay ... all right, sal, it is okay.  i got everything straightened out ... it is going to be okay.
get over there!
look, i talked to him and it is not going to be a helicopter - they can not land on top of the roof - so they are comin' with a big ... limousine bus and they will take us to the airport - and they are going to get a jet ... so things are rollin' ... they are movin' ... i also ordered some food ... i got some pizzas for us, all right?  i got some things to drink - i got sodas ... i even asked them for aspirins ... I am doin' what i can ... now i got to pay for the pizza ... where are the marked bills?
are we going to get the ball rolling?
what are you talking about?  what do you think I am doin'?  I am gettin' the ball rollin'.  I am keeping these people happy ... I am keeping you happy ... i got to keep the cops cooled out ... i got to do everything ... i got to pay for the pizza ... I am workin' on it, do you know what i mean?  I am workin' on it ... jesus christ!  i got to do it all ... i got all the ideas ... you want me to give you the gun?  you want to take it over?
gene -- you smilin'?
no.  i never smile any more.
whattaya think: we gonna kill any civilians tonight, gene?
i never make bets or guesses, that way I am never wrong and i never have to pay out.
gene, jesus, what a bull he is!
so whatsa deal?
they jet's comin' out.  but do not let 'em off the ground.
what if we gotta kill a whole lot of people?
do not let 'em off the ground.
listen.
if you are right I am going to back you a hundred percent, you know that.
fuck you, sir - if I am right, i do not need you.  what i want is - if i make an honest mistake i want help.
you do not smoke ... why do you want to start now.
because I am scared, that is why. you never smoked?
i used to, but i stopped.
you stopped?  why?
because i do not want cancer.
you do not want cancer?  you are about to get your head blown off, you are worried about cancer.  gimme the cigarette.
no!  I am not kidding.  do not you understand?  you are pure!
pure?
you should not start now.
for god's sake!  as soon as I am outta this bank robbery, I am going to stop ... okay?
go ahead.  do what you want to do. i hate to see you break a perfect record.  you oughta take care of your body.
my body?  what for?
your body is the temple of the lord.
you are serious!
you are really pure, you know?  you got a perfect record.  you never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now?
you know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he is got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground. god forbid i should say something to him like, 'listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it is illegal' and he storms outta the house.  you rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it?
you gonna smoke the cigarette?
yes...
yeah?
we are bringing in your wife...
is he all right?  is he all right?
he is all doped up.
i want to talk to him.
he is groggy, sonny.  let me get him on his feet and he will call you back.
leon?  whatsa matter?  they give you a shot down the hospital or what?
oh, god, they shot me with like unreal!
well, you got to get hold of yourself.  you got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
oh no!
he is got eight people in there with him.  he is got this kid with him ... they are going to shoot the people.
i can not help it.  i can not stop him from anything.
if he will not listen to you, who will he listen to?
he will not listen to anybody.  he is been very crazy all summer.  since june he is been trying to kill me.
you try calling the police?
what good is that?  they could not stop him.  and it would just make him mad.  they do not know him.
somebody is got to stop him, leon.
he was under great strain: you do not understand, he is a very mixed up person.
he is makin' threats in there.
he is scared.  it is crazy.  i never met anyone like him.  his wife, he is a wonderful father to his children.  his mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent. unbelievable.  i wanted to get married ... he did not really want it ... he is married already!  but he did it.  i do not know why.  i thought it would help me, but it didn't.  i was just as confused and unhappy was before; i did terrible things.
what kind of things, leon?
ten days i spent in atlantic city - sonny was frantic - he knew i was drinking; he did not know where i was ... who i was with.  i could not explain why i did the things i did. so i went to this psychiatrist who explained to me i was a woman in a man's body.  so sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  my god, he is in hock up to his ears already.
he needed money?  for the operation for you?
it made him crazy - so much demand, he would fly into this rages.  and i got more depressed than ever; i saw I would never get the operation.  so i tried to take my life - i swallowed about a half pound of pills ... blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers ... you name it. but i just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'wow!'  so when i hear he is in the bank, i almost go crazy because i know he is doin' it for me.
well, do not you figure you owe to him to get him out of there?
i can not talk to him.
you are in it up to your ass, leon. you are an accessory.  you talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case.
I am afraid.
how is he gonna hurt you on the telephone?
i do not know what to say to him.  i can't.
you think it over, leon.
what?
they keep sayin' two homosexuals. I am not a homosexual.  i want you to stop them saying that.
that is all they are interested in - it is a freak show to them.  i can not control it, sal - let'em say what they want.  forget it.  it do not matter.
we are all set at kennedy.
what makes you think you will be able to control it?
he is totally unstable.  he will make a mistake.
he has not so far.  I am the one who can make a mistake.  that is what scares the shit out of me.
eugene, at 3:07, this became federal.  why do not i take it over now?
first off, get the lights back on and the air conditioning.
no more favors.  that is all over, sonny.
aw, jesus ... you been doin' us favors all night!
I have got a jet.  I will have airport limousine here in a half hour.  i want the hostages.
bullshit!
I would like to work with you on this, not against you.
well, jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
okay, when do i get them?
at the airport.  we get on the plane, check it out, and if it is all okay we will send them out. except one.
i want them all.
i want to talk to leon.
i want to come in, and see if everybody's okay.
you got guts.  you think if sal and me have cut their throats we are going to let you out?
i have to see.
it is the fbi.  he wants to come in.
have him walk in backwards.
jesus, you would like to kill me, too.
i would not like to, but i will, if i have to.
nothin' personal, huh?  the man that kills me, i want him to do it because he hates my guts.  not because it is a job.  okay, let's go ... but you got to walk in backwards.
nobody give their right name ... it is the fbi!
i just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here.
sal?
they got to stop sayin' that.
wait a minute!  what the fuck you tryin' to tell me?
what i said.  you just sit quiet and we will handle sal.
what did he say?
he was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the tv.
why could not he talk about that here?
he was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, sal.  what is wrong with him?
hey, you okay?
he is got diabetes.  he is not a well person.
those bastards -- they poisoned the pizza!  sal - you did not eat any pizza!?
i did not eat any pizza.
i told you, he is got diabetes.
what is wrong?
the manager, he is diabetic, he is lookin' bad.
hello.  hello, leon.
hello, sonny.
how are you doing?
well... I am out of the hospital.
yeah.  you said... i thought you were never getting out?
i never thought I would get out this way.  I will tell you.
well.... huh ...
ooohh....
oh... huh ... how you feeling?
I am really shakey.
well, you know ... moretti told me before that you were drugged up.
yeah.  it was terrible.
that... huh... they just shoot you with drugs.
you come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  and they start putting things in your arm... you know.  how do they expect you to get uncrazy if you are asleep all the time?
yeah...
you can not talk or do anything.  you really feel... you know... I am just sort of coming out of it now.
so... that sure is something.
yeah.  so how are you?
fine, thank you.  I am in trouble. that is... now i am!
yeah... i know.
i do not know what I am going to do... you know.  boy... I am dying.
what?  what are you talking about? you are dying?  did you ever listen to yourself when you say that?
what are you talking about?
what do you mean... what am i talking about?  do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life?  i am dying.  do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you?
now do not give me that deep shit now.  do not start with that shit.
no really... i do not think that you realize what it means.  the things that you do, sonny.  you put a gun to somebody is head...
i do not know what I am doing.
yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody is head... and you say go to sleep so that it will not hurt when i pull the trigger. death?  do not talk about death to me.  i have been living with death for the last six months.  why do you think I am in the hospital?  i take a handful of pills to get away from you.  and then here i am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  i have no friends left.  no job.  i can not live.  i have to live with people. this death business... I am sorry!
I am not on the phone to talk to you about that.  well, i do not know what to say, leon.  when you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  i mean, what am i supposed to say?
I am sorry...
i told you.  that i got a lot of pressures.  you said to me that you needed money, and i knew that you needed money!  i saw you there lying in the hospital like that... and i said... shit, man, i got to get this guy some money.
but i did not ask you to go rob a bank.
all right.  i know you did not ask me.  you did not ask me but i did it.
well...
i did it on my own.  i did this all on my own.  i am not laying it on anybody.  nothing on anybody.  I will tell you something, though, it is about time that i squared away my accounts... you know.  i am squaring away my accounts with life.  maye this whole thing is going to end, somehow.  maybe it will just end! maybe I will just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. that would be all right too!  i said... i thought i would square it away with you... you know?  that i would get you down here and that i would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip...
what trip?
I am getting out of here, man.

you said a mouthful... sweetheart!
hey, sonny!  I am watchin' it on tv!
what about the kids?
they do not know, i sent them to the neighbors.  sonny, jesus, it is not like you.  i can not believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day i knew you.
heidi, I am dying.
i blame myself, sonny.  i notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you are yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  and then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  it is ridiculous. I am not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'you pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  yellin' at me in front of all those people.  because you never talked and i never been scared of you, never.  i think: he is going to shoot me and dump my body in the river.
heidi, for christ sake, shut up! will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
see?  you are screaming with the language and all!  a person can not communicate with you.  you become a stranger in your own home...
...because you hurt me, god how you hurt me.  can you imagine, marrying another man?  did i do something to make you do that?  did i ever turn you down, or anything?  the only thing i could not do, you are going to laugh, is go on top - i got this fear of high places!  and i let myself get fat.
do not call yourself fat.
i know you can not stand me to say I am fat.  like i can not stand you being a bank robber.  i guess that is what love is -- huh, sonny?
heidi - why did not you come down here?
jesus - what - I am afraid - I am going to get shot or whatever.  you oughta see it on tv, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they are loaded with gear.
they are not after you, they are after me.
listen, it is late already when i realize it is not just a couple of ordinary faggots, it is just you and sal.  i could not get a baby sitter.
I am okay ... I am okay ...
you know more than the doctor? you are not okay, look at you.  come on ...  ... let's get him out ...
I am not going.  I am okay.
hey!  I am tryin' to help you.
i stay here.  damn it.  i just needed the insulin.  I am used to it. go on.  go on.
you tell me.  is he endangering his health, because if you tell me he is, I will get him out.
I will be god damned if you will.
oh, jesus!  you want to be a martyr or a hero or what?
my kids ... kimmy and jimmy.
they are beautiful ...
I will never see them again, mister mulvaney.
they look like good kids.
they are like any others but they are special to me.  you got kids?  you told me; you got two.
special to me, too.
you like me?
sure - we like you.
no you don't.
you seem like a likable enough guy. it is hard to judge.
hey, sal ... how you doin'?
okay.
you know, i do not know him very well - but he is not gay ... and he is not going back to prison ... one time when he was in prison, they gang-banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him ... so sal is not goin' back to prison, no way.
I am sorry.
you know ... i like you people ... i really do.
we like you, too.
you know - i had a job once.  i used to work in a bank.  i had been training ... i used to have a boss ... mr. don frio ... he wore a toupee ... i wonder if you would hire me if i came in here and asked you for a job ...
would i hire you?
yeah.
why not?
i do not think so.
i wish somebody would tell me I am going to live long enough for it to be a habit.  my parent, she will be okay. my husband, he will be okay.  i even know who the bum is going to marry. terrific.  she will take good care of him.
girls, i wanta apologize.  for my language back there.
sonny!  could you come out, please? could you come out, please?
it is my mother.  who needs this shit?
what do you want here, ma?  you could of watched it on tv.
my god, sonny - you oughtta see - alla brooklyn is here!  on all 3 networks!
mom - i got it all worked out; it is over.  the best thing is you go home.  watch it on tv.
i talked to the fbi, i told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it is going to be okay.
you did what?  who did you talk to? what for?
well, I am only trying to get you outta this.  i told them you were in vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
oh my god, mother!
i said you were never a faggot.
do not talk to them anymore.  sal and me are getting a jet, we are going to algeria - I will write you from there.
he was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... algeria?
we can not stay here.
oh my god!  i do not understand.  if you needed money, why could not you come to me?  everything i got is yours.  i got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  it is yours.  you know it.
mom - they are sending a bus to take us to the airport.  you understand? if you are here - they are not going to send it.  they will think I am going to come out with you.
what is wrong with that?  the fbi was very understanding when i explained it to him.  everybody knows it is not you ... it is the pressures from your home life.
for god's sake do not start in on heidi again ...
did i say a thing against her?  god forbid i should say anything against that fat cunt.
mom.  mom.  there are some things a mother should not say in front of her son.
if she comes down here, so help me I am going to mash her brains in. everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her.  since then, forget it.
she does not have anything to do with it!  you understand that? mother?  this is me!
i know you would not need leon if heidi was treating you right.  the thing i do not understand is why you come out and sleep with heidi anyway?  you got two kids on welfare now.  what are you goin' to bed with her, you do not have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
not now, mom, please.
what will you do?  come out.
i can't, mom.  if i come out sal will kill them.
oh.  run.
what the hell for?  twenty-five years in the pen?
maybe...
maybe!  aw christ, what dreams you live on!  maybe what?
I am a fuckup and an outcast.  there is not one single person in my life i have not hurt through my love. you understand that?  I am the most dangerous person in the world, because if i love you, watch out, you are going to get fucked, fucked over and fucked out!
no!
did pop come down?
no.  this really pissed him off, sonny.  he says you are dead.  he says he does not have a son.
he is right.  you shoulda done what he did.  go home.  do not talk to the fbi anymore.
mister mulvaney?
yeah?
are you a lawyer?
no.  i had some legal training, but...
i want to dictate my will.  i need a notary?
these seats come out?
yeah.
jesus, you are the man!
come on, what is under this?
i was lookin' at it.  i saw you, man!  jesus!  you oughta see yourself!  you would not believe it.
yes, i would.
god damn it, sheila is not going to believe it.  they just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to  and i say, 'shit, another load of elks for the massage parlors.'
okay.
i do not want him.
what can he do, he is clean...
gimme the black guy...
aw, hey...
come on, nobody's going to get hurt. if they were going to shoot, they would shoot now.
i can not allow that, sonny...
you can not allow!  I am running this thing, what gives you the idea you can say shit?  come on.  I will pay you.  whatta you want?  two hundred?  a thousand?
you will be okay.
you men shoot, aim for the white meat!

hey, sonny - you did it!
let's move it, goddamn it.
how did you know your son was involved?
it was on the tv.
when was the last time you saw sal?
oh, a long time.  because i kept asking my husband where the heck could junior be?  he was not around here.  i thought maybe he was in prison or some place.
did you know he was a homosexual?
no, not until after they killed him.
did you always call him junior.
yeah.
do you remember anything else about sal?
no, that is all.
ah, sonny!  good luck, you know?
you were terrific, too!
hey.  it is raining.
