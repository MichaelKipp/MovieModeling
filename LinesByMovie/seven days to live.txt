well, look here!
ladies and gentlemen: the "straub country-residence".
damn, this thing is heavy. where do you want to have it?
tenth floor.
very funny.
look at this.  the lock is totally demolished.
i guess someone lost their key. you did get your tetanus shots, i hope?
twenty-three, to be exact.
i wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  you can afford to spend some money.  if i was you, i'd spare myself all the hard work.  besides, didn't you want to start writing again?
why else?
come on, say it.  you know...
say it anyway.  come on, how much do you love me?
"with you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
i have to cut his windpipe...
you're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
what else should i do, damn it, he's dying!
ellen, move aside...
oh god, tommi...
stop that!
you'll never get away from me!
so, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
they say it's fantastic.  at least that's what i read in a men's magazine.  so who are the two lucky ones?
me and the muse, of course.  how is your book coming along?
oh, the muse... we're still having our differences.  you know how it is with women.
well then, i guess i'd better leave the two of you alone.  but don't forget...
what kind of a horrible thing is that?
it still worked in town.
i mean the armchair!
oh, that was upstairs.  a real antiquity!  i think it's great.
maybe the antenna's broken.
we're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! damned box!
hey... the fuse.
oh, damnit!
do you know where fuse box is?
in the cellar, i think. wait, i'll take care of it.
look at this!  we'll have to fix the whole wiring.  this stuff is dangerous as hell.
we'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
are you crazy?  that costs a fortune!
do you have a better idea?
i'll do it myself.
you?
my father was an electrician. already forgot that?
my father was a pilot.  and do i know how to fly?
hey, flower child, the sixties are over.  and this stuff is hazardous to your health.
yes, daddy.
where are you going?
well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least i'll go get myself some cigarettes.
what are you doing?
making our very own solstice fire.
is everything alright?  aren't you feeling well?
i just had a really strange experience.
maybe i should talk to dr. roth about it.
hey, take your time.  you know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
i have a funny feeling.  do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
we just have to make a new beginning.
cherry-red tears.
what?
cherry-red tears, your first book. i read it at least nine times.  and then i found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
not a book fair.  i was signing autographs in a department store.
i was so excited about meeting you. again and again, i kept getting in the back of the line so i could be the last to talk to you.
and two months later, we got married.  and all because of one sentence:  "with you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
i miss tommi so much.
so do i, believe me.
do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
maybe different.  i don't know, ellen.
if we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together.
hello.  can i help you?
does this dog here belong to you?
no, i've never seen him before.
you know, i saw him sitting outside your gate...  oh, i'm sorry, i'm forgetting my manners again!  i haven't even introduced myself yet. hi, my name's lindner. karl lindner.
ellen straub.
it's a pleasure.  you're from the city, right?
do i look like it that much?
village gossip.  you're a real attraction here.
i guess it's too lonely for most folks.  it's time for me to get going. it's been a pleasure meeting you.
wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
who was that?
someone from the village.
martin, it's not funny!
you know, it's not always easy for me, either.  but at least i try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. don't you remember what we promised to each other?  honesty - trust!
come on, this isn't about honesty. you just need a good night's sleep. the way you toss and turn all night, even i hardly get any sleep.
now, what did i do to deserve this?
come on, at least try one.  it took me two hours to make these.
so, did you sleep good?
yeah... i have to go to town.
hey, you're still here.  i suppose you like it here with us.
no, thanks.  i have everything i need.  drive safely, you hear?
listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. but i know the difference between when i'm overstrung and when i'm seeing things that are simply not there! besides, it only began after we moved!
there is, of course, another possible explanation which i dearly hope is not the case.
and that is?
a tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
why not?  she can guard the house. by the way, i gave her a name: clara.
where have you been all day?
i went to see prof. roth!  you know, i had another one of those dreams last night.  i saw tommi!
but that's not the point! what if all these things are somehow connected?
oh, baloney.  you should just hear yourself talk!
oh, mrs. straub.  may i introduce you to my wife?
just call me elisabeth.
ellen.
you're doing fine, aren't you?  i mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
stop scaring people.  let's go. we need to be on our way.
excuse us.  but do stop by for a visit sometime!  you are welcome anytime.
you didn't tell her!
we should leave the past alone.
well, it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it.
where have you been?
in the village.  look what i found.
"events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  that we've created ourselves a ghost?  come on!
it's just a feeling.  don't you sense it, too?
what? what am i supposed to sense?
the house - tommi - something just doesn't jive here...
who's that?
i haven't the slightest idea.
hey, my man!  how's the masterpiece coming along?
not so bad, if i could get some peace and quiet around here.
what?
look at this!  the dog!  she's dead!
she was old.
old?!  come look at this!  she has wounds.  wounds on her head.  like thrashes.  or bites.
maybe an animal.
an animal?  what kind of animal? a goddamned t-rex, or what?
oh, ellen!  i've been wondering when you'd come.  why don't you step in.
thank you.
i really hate to bother him, but...
oh no, no.  you're not bothering him.  he has lots of time since he's been retired.
you know, after doing that job for so many years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life.  flowers incorporate a beauty that i always missed in life.  but certainly, you're not here to chat about my hobbies.
1976.  what happened back then?
do yourself a favor:  don't ask.
i appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  i need to know what happened in there.
frank kosinski.  here's the address.  go see him.  ask him.
thank you.  elisabeth, i didn't mean to...
that's alright.  don't misunderstand my husband.  it's only that he's already had enough problems with this case. and who would believe him if he told the truth?
but what is the truth?
i don't know all about what happened back then.  but it always stood between me and my husband.
let me guess:  another short circuit?
hi, darling.
during the middle ages people were executed at every corner.  what's your point?
this house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors.  "there is something negative about the place..."  what the hell are you trying to say?  come on!  spit it out!
will you finally cut it out?  just in case you haven't noticed, i am trying to write a book here.  and maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it's a pretty tough job. so why can't you just leave me alone?
damn it, look at you!  don't you see what's happening with you?  we need to get out of here, don't you understand?  out of this house!
martin, what-
it's simply too dangerous here! but no, you always have to have it your way.
you know what i have to do now, and believe me:  i don't enjoy doing this.
martin, damnit, what are you up to? let go of me!
of course you'll give me the blame again.  like back then.  just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - isn't that right, ellen?
what are you talking about-
mrs. straub!
i've killed my husband!
what?
i think i've killed him.  martin, my husband, i've killed him!  that is, i'm not sure, but...
it all went so fast.  he was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  i only wanted to defend myself.  you have to call the police...
we can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
oh, ellen.  my sweet ellen... of course i knew.
we loved each other once.  have you forgotten that?
i think it's starting again. you know... there was something peculiar.  if only i knew...
peculiar?  you mean, like back then?
yes, something was...
hammer?
how could i fail to notice that! - i have to go...
i told you, there is no way out. he won't let you go.
'he'?  whom do you mean-
it's important - he knows the last chapter.
your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
you know, tommi wants me to become the man i used to be.
...so he's dictating you a new bestseller?  whatever that is, it's not our son.
what?
i have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... a real dirty... big city. what do you think?
how did you get me out of there?
i wouldn't have made it by myself.
for god's sake, what happened to me?
you don't remember?
