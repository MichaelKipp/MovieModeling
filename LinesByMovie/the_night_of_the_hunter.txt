stand still, miss jenny!
there! what is so hard about that!
where is your mom?
out shopping -- you are bleeding, dad --
listen to me john.
here they come.
dad, you are bleeding...
listen to me son. you got to swear. swear means promise. first swear you will take care of little pearl. guard her with your life, boy. then swear you will not never tell where that money's hid. not even your mom.
yes, dad.
you understand?
not even her?
you got common sense. she ain't. when you grow up that money'll be yours. now swear. "i will guard pearl with my life..."
i will guard pearl with my life...
..."and i will not never tell about the money."
and i will not never tell about the money.
you, pearl. you swear too.
who is them blue men yonder?
blue men.
ben, I am a man of god.
tryin' to make me talk about it in my sleep!
no, ben.
what did i say?  what? what? what? what?
you was quotin' scripture. you said -- you said, "and a little child shall lead them."
hm!
you killed two men, ben harper.
that is right, preacher. i robbed that bank because i got tired of seein' children roamin' the woodlands without food, children roamin' the highways in this year of depression; children sleepin' in old abandoned car bodies on junk-heaps; and i promised myself I would never see the day when my youngins'd want.
with that ten thousand dollars i could build a tabernacle that would make the wheeling island tabernacle look like a chicken-house!
would you have free candy for the kids, preacher?
think of it, ben! with that cursed, bloodied gold!
how come you got that stickknife hid in your bed-blankets, preacher?
i come not with peace but with a sword.
you, preacher?
that sword has served me through many an evil time, ben harper.
what religion do you profess, preacher?
the religion the almighty and me worked out betwixt us.
I will bet.
salvation is a last-minute business, boy.
keep talkin', preacher.
if you was to let that money serve the lord's purposes, he might feel kindly turned towards you.
keep talkin', preacher.
any trouble?
no.
he was a cool one, that harper. never broke.
he carried on some; kicked.
he never told about the money.
no.
what do you figure he done with it?
he took the secret with him when i dropped him.
hing, hang, hung.
you better not sing that song.
why?
'cause you are too little.
willa harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: no woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! the lord meant that job for two!
icey, i do not want a husband.
fiddlesticks!
tell me a story, john.
once upon a time there was a rich king...  ...and he had him a son and a daughter and they all lived in a castle over in africa. well, one day this king got taken away by bad men and before he got took off he told his son to kill anyone that tried to steal their gold, and before long these bad men come back and --
the blue men?
just a man.  goodnight pearl, sleep tight; and do not let the bedbugs bite.
'night miss jenny; do not let the bedbugs bite.
she do not put in at cresap's landing no more, but she still blows as she passes. come on in and have a cup of coffee.
am not nobody stole dad's skiff.
am not nobody goin' to neither, long as uncle birdie's around.
am not seen you in a coon's age, johnny.
i been mindin' pearl.
pshaw now! am not it a caution what women'll load onto a feller's back when he am not lookin'?
it is a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
so you am not with the state no more?
i must wend my way down river on the lord's work.
you am not leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
john: take that look offen your face and act nice.
he do not mean no impudence; do you, boy?  do you, boy? ah, many's the time poor brother ben told me about these youngins.
why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
is that all?
my, that fudge smells yummy!
it is for the pick-nick. and you will not get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
that feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
it is awful soon after ben's passing.
if ever i saw a sign from heaven!
john do not like him much.
pearl dotes on him.
the boy worries me. it is silly, but it is like there was something still between him and his dad.
what he needs is a dose o' salts!
there is something else.
what?
the money, icey.
i declare, you will let that money haunt you to your grave, willa harper!
i would love to be satisfied harry powell do not think I have got that money somewhere.
you will come right out and ask that man of god!  mr. paow-well!  clear that evil mud out of your soul!
you go set down by the river.
oh, icey, I am a sight!
get along with you.
john, mr. powell has got something to tell you.
well, john, the night before your father died, he told me what he did with that money.
john...
sshhh...
it was down at cresap's landing, along the river shore, birdie steptoe was a pilot in the good old days of yore. now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
when'll dad's skiff be ready?
can not hear ye, boy.  ...so the big boats heave a sigh, they blow for uncle birdie...
when'll the skiff be ready?
and the times that are gone by. I will have her ready inside of a week; and then we will go fishin'. how is your maw?
o, she is all right.
how is your sister pearl?
just fine.
leavin', boy?
yep; gotta watch out for pearl, uncle birdie.
well goodnight, boy. come again -- any time.
did you hear what i said, son?
huh?
married! we have decided to go to sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
you am not my dad! you will not never be my dad!
-- and when we come back, we will all be friends -- and share our fortunes together, john!
you think you can make me tell! but i won't! i won't! i won't!
tell me what, boy?
nothin'!
are we keeping secrets from each other, little lad?
no. no.
now can i tell?
hm?
when mr. powell's our daddy then i can tell him about --
you swore, pearl!
john! don't!
you promised dad you would not never tell!
harry!
i was praying.
oh, I am sorry, harry! i did not know! i thought maybe --
you thought, willa, that the moment you walked in that door I would start in to pawing you in the abominable way men are supposed to do on their wedding night. am not that right, now?
no, harry! i thought --
i think it is time we got one thing perfectly clear, willa. marriage to me represents a blending of two spirits in the sight of heaven.
get up, willa.
harry, what --
get up.
do you want more children, willa?
i -- no, i --
it is the business of our marriage to mind those two you have now -- not to beget more.
yes.
aaa-menn!
you have all sinned!
yes! yes!
but which one of you can say as i can say: i drove a good man to murder because i kept a-houndin' him for clothes and per-fumes and face paint!
and the lord told that man --
yes! yes!
the lord said, take that money and throw it in the river!
yes! yes! hallelujah!
throw that money in the river! in the river!
in the riiv-er!
you will get awful mad, john. i done a sin!
you what?
pearl! you am not --
john, do not be mad! do not be mad! i was just playing with it! i did not tell no one!
it is all here.
pearl! oh, pearl!
what are you doing, boy?
getting pearl to bed. i --
what is taking you so long about it?
it -- she --
what is that you are playing with, boy?
pearl's junk. mom gets mad when she plays out here and do not clean up afterward.
come on, children!
your mother says you tattled on me, boy. she says you told her that i asked you where that money was hid.
yes. yes.
that was not very nice of you, john. have a heart, boy.
here's your can o' hooks, uncle birdie.
there hain't nary hook in the land smart enough to hook mister gar. what a feller needs is mother-wit -- and a horse-hair.
will not he bust it, uncle birdie?
shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
do you mind me cussin', boy?
no.
tell you why i ask -- your step-pa being' a preacher an' all...
can we eat him, uncle birdie?
if you got an appetite for bones and bitterness.
she thinks that money's in the river, but you and me, we know better, do not we, boy?
i do not know nothin'!
the summer is young yet, little lad.  pearl?
john's a feller who likes to keep secrets.
mm-hm.
I will tell you a secret.
yes?
i knowed your daddy.  and do you know what your daddy said to me? he said, "tell my little girl pearl there is to be no secrets between her and you."
yes?
now it is your turn.
what secret shall i tell?
how old are you?
that is no secret. I am five.
sure, that is no secret.
what is your name?
you are just foolin'! my name's pearl.
tst-tst! then i reckon I will have to try again! where is the money hid?
you see? we can not have anything to do with john.  you and me will go down to the parlor.
miz jenny! miz jenny!
that boy's as stubborn and mulish as a sheep!
it is a shame!
plan on a longer visit next time.
you do not hardly get settled till you are frettin' to git home again.
yes; john's bad.
tell me another secret about my dad.
o no! your turn!
all right.
where is the money hid.
john's bad.
where is the money hid? tell me, you little wretch, or I will tear your arm off!
icey, I am worried about willa.
how do you mean?
I am figurin' how i can say it so's you will not get mad.
say what, walt spoon!
there is somethin' wrong about it, mother.
about what!
about mr. powell. all of it!
walt!
now, mother, a body can not help their feelin's.
may the lord have mercy on you, walt spoon!
mother, i only --
are you through praying?
I am through, harry.
you were listening outside the parlor window.
it is not in the river, is it harry?
answer me!
ben never told you he throwed it in the river? did he?
what is wrong, mother?
sshhh! he is in there.
who?
mr. powell!  willa has run away!
I will be switched!...
just went?
she took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old model-t --
is he hit pretty bad?
all to pieces!
there is a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
a man of the cloth?
what can we do, mother?
i thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
mister powell?
a strange woman is a narrow pit!
amen! amen!
she lieth in wait as for a prey. and increaseth the transgressors among men.
my dear, dear friends! whatever would i do without you!
mister powell!
is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
it is my shame -- my crown of thorns. and i must wear it bravely.
what could have possessed that girl!
satan.
ah.
did not you have no inkling?
yes; from the first night.
the first night?
our honeymoon.
how is that?
she turned me out of the bed.
what do you figure to do?
do? why stay and take care of them little kids. maybe it was never meant for a woman like willa to taint their young lives.
that is mighty brave of you, reverend.
i reckon it is been ordained this way, brother spoon.
did not -- did not she leave no word?
a scrawl. on a piece of notepaper on the bureau.
i burned it.  i tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
amen.
the pitcher has went to the well once too often, my friends.
she will come draggin' her tail back home.
she will not be back. i reckon I would be safe in promisin' you that.
maybe she is just run off on a spree.
am not no sense in it, neither. i figured somethin' like this was brewin' when she went to bed last night.
how?
she tarried around the kitchen after I would gone up, and when i went downstairs to see what was wrong...
what!
she would found this fruit jar of dandelion wine  that the husband -- harper -- had hid somewheres in the cellar.  she was drinking.
i tried to save her.
i know you did, reverend. oh, i know how you tried!
the devil wins sometimes!
where is mom?
she is gone to moundsville.
to see dad?
yes, i reckon that is it.
someone is after us, pearl.
i want to go upstairs. it is cold and spidery down here. I am hungry.
now listen to me, pearl. you and me is runnin' off tonight.
why?
if we stay here somethin' awful will happen to us.
will not daddy powell take care of us?
no, that is just it. no.
where are we goin', john?
somewheres. i do not know yet.
I am hungry, john.
we will steal somethin' to eat.
it will spoil our supper.
just look at you! dust and filth from top to toe!
want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
thank you, no. thank you, dear icey. I will tend to them. thank you.
I am hungry.
why, sure. and there is fried chicken and candied sweets and cornsticks and apple cobbler!
can i have my supper please?
naturally.
can i have milk too?
yes. but first of all we will have a little talk.
about our secrets.
no.
why, pray tell?
because john said i mustn't.
just tell me now; where is the money hid?
but i swore. i promised john i would not tell.
john -- does not -- matter! can not i get that through your head, you poor, silly, disgusting little wretch!
now! where is it hid, honey?
I will tell.
i thought i told you to keep your mouth shut --
no, -- it am not fair to make pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I will tell.
all right boy: where is the money?
in the cellar. buried under a stone in the floor.
all right...  come along.
what?
go ahead of me -- the both of you.
you do not reckon I would leave you.
do not you believe me?
why sure, boy, sure.
now where, boy? mind; no tricks. i can not abide liars.
