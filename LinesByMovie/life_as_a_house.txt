run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
why?
he will be gone for his birthday.
this has got to stop!
he escaped.  he is going back in.
does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
there are no windows facing my...exposure.
george, this is the third time.
the plumber's due out on friday.
you will have to explain that to the police.
you were the only neighbor i could tolerate.
i did warn you.
my life is a warning.  i just can not figure out for what.
i do not have a clue anymore.  i wish you would talk to him.  he needs a man.
his father is a man.
a man he respects.
thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.
are you wearing eye shadow?
no.
take it off.
do it now!
if i walk out the door, who is going to be here tonight for the follow through?
queer.
what did you say?
dad said it first.
been thinking?
no.
sorry i got you into trouble.
I will survive.
he must.
he seems lonely.
are you his friend?
no.
why?
marilyn manson...and i guess he is into guys.  i hate nose rings.  and the blue eye shadow thing really is not working.
this is such a street of whiners.
from tuesday to yesterday, not including monday or today.  okay...mrs. dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  the corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
ipo's caused the rat population on this street.
and of course the beck's, with the...
it could have been a squirt gun.
you have been good this week.
are you guys' friends?
we have known each other since grade school.
i mean, but did you both go camping on weekends?  listen to music?  masturbate together?  talk on the phone?
i aimed high.
we just were not very much alike, i guess. i do not know.  i liked your dad more than i liked you.
i would not want you as a friend.
george just never really...aimed that high.  even with not hitting a rabbit.  i knew you were doing that, by the way. that is why i stopped doing it with you. you were no fun.  it was always like you were frightened.  quiet and boring.
funny how he is the architect and you are just a loud mouth cop.
he builds models for architects.  his dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  designed and built the coolest houses I have ever seen.
was bankrupt and dead before i was twenty.
left you this place.
it was in my name so he would not lose it. he stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
do you know what I would give to have this! forget how i got it!  i can not afford dirt in this town.  i live in riverside, goddammitt  and you get to piss in the ocean.
your kid was down around diver's cover again, smoking pot.  i did not write him up...told him i would not tell you...
thanks for telling me.
at least your father tried, george.
you should lock your doors.
ring the bell before you try the door.
did sam call to tell you he would not be over this weekend?
you let him pierce his nose?
lock the door behind you.
where is he?
where he always is.
marco!
what are you doing?
I am not cheating!  I am not looking!
what are you doing?
he does not answer.
he never answers.
why does he have a lock on his door?
because he put the lock on!  do you think i told him he could have a nose ring?! why do you ask me everything you should ask him!?  i do not know anything, anymore!
what are you doing in my room?
i did not go in your room.
i locked the door!  get out!  i locked the door!  get out!
I am good, thanks.
what are you on?
pardon me?
how much weight have you lost?
oh...nothing.  thirty pounds.  i just have not been very hungry.
how is your wife?
when we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry.  now she is just hostile.
right...she married...what was he?
he buys and sells the world.
peter webber!  right.  quite the spotlight on that guy.
i did tell you, did not i?  that I would be ready to start the berlin model today?
well, that is sort of...you're sure you are not hungry?
this is not me.  we can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer.  but you will not change.
typing and clicking myself to renderings is not why i started building models.
all of us are typing and clicking, george.  whether we want to, or not.
I am not.
which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects.  it does not make a lot of sense anymore to want what we do not have and do not want what we do.
I have been here twenty years.
maybe that is too long.
maybe...?
that is too long.
oh.
how old are you?
forty.
we were probably in school together.  you went to berkley?
class of eighty-six!  i did not know you were there.
i was a sophomore when i got the call my parents were dead.
listen...maybe i can get you a year.
i hate this job.
what are you talking about?  you love your job.
from the day i started...to today.  can not stand it.
then it sounds like I am doing you a favor.
it may sound that way, but i react out of fear.  my life has nothing to do with what i like or do not like.  you have not been listening, have you?
i did not know there would be a quiz, george.
for everything.
well, i feel better about this now.
good.  i was hoping for that.
I have got one favor to ask.
what can i do for you, george?
i built my first model here when i was twenty.  there are hundreds of them on shelves around the office.  twenty years of my life.  i was wondering if i might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home?  only the ones that really mean something to me.
oh, well...those are...i mean, we do not get to keep our work.  i could maybe ask them if you could choose one.  but, you know, frankly george, you were the best. computer models can not begin to match the beauty you gave yours.  they are a part of this firm.  they inspire me.  i go out there and sometimes just stare at something I have designed.  it amazes me. i would miss that too much.  look, i may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I am sure it will be okay.
thank you.
well, it is the least i can do.
yes, it is.
I would eat a lot of red meat.
good for you.
what would you do?
I would build a house.
what kind of house?
you know what mortise and tenon is?
no one's really said four months is all you have, have they?
stage four pancreatic cancer.  they have not even pretended to offer treatment.  you tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
can you build a house in four months?
i can die trying.
good for you.
i have not been touched in years.
I am sorry, i do not know what that was.
a handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. doctors, people who have to touch you. but not by people who want to.
no.  a friend... your mother?  everybody gets touched by someone they love.
is not that weird?  i mean, i dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years.  six years.  i know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he would run up and wrap his arms around me.
i called everyone, everywhere!  you just vanished!  you could be dead!
thanks for waking me up.  picking me up. you are loud today.
you are inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
you are the most beautiful woman i have ever known in my life.
what?
I am not talking just physically.  even your anger is perfect.
i did not think you would know i went missing.
you did not think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
a blueprint spool.
where have you been for a week?!
four days.  i left to think.
what did you do with your dog?
kurt's been feeding him.
but you can not call me while you think?
i was not thinking.  look, I am sorry i did not think to call you while i thought...i think.
i need to talk to you.
why would they tow your truck?
i was parked in day parking.
why call me?
I am going to tear down the shack and build my house.
you have been saying that for twenty years. while we were dating, you said it.
there is nothing anymore to stop me.
money?
severance pay.  and I am going to cash in my life insurance policy.
how many years did i live with your beams and boards?  first in the garage, then in the living room.  we are going to do it, robin.  next year.  next year.  salvaged floorboards from a house in pasadena. doors from a church in new hampshire...
i love those doors.
where will you live?
the garage.
look, i was not serious about you taking sam, so you do not have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
when is school over?
friday...god, i hate the thought of him home all day.
I will be by saturday to pick him up.
he does not want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
not for the weekend.  for the summer.
you and sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
the garage is plumbed.  I will put in a toilet.  we will survive.
thank you for at least sounding sincere.
sounding?  i need help.  he is cheap labor.
one of you would end up dead.
at least we will have a house to show for it.
forget it, really.  I will survive.
i want him with me.
no, you don't.  trust me.
hey, hey!
I am married.
the whole summer, man.  party in tahoe.
i do not know.
it will just be my brother the dweeb on weekends.  all we got to do is sand and paint the cabin, dude.  my dad's going to let me use the boat and my charm is going to let me use my rod.  income village is the place to hook up with hump.
I will ask.
hey, it beats letting town folk go down on you for the summer.
i never said anything.  i have not done anything.
i know what the deal is.  josh is a pimp. I am not stupid.
you do not know what the deal is.  there is no fucking deal.
alyssa.
why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
I am living here while i build another house.
is that legal?
do not you have school?
nope.
what is today?
monday.
my keys.
what is that?
i had them in my pocket.
I am not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I have decided.
i forgot where i put my keys.
and you thought they might be under her dress?
your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
to check up on me?
I will be around to check up on you.
why would you be there?
because i live there.
you live in cory's parents' cabin?
did you tell him he is spending the summer with me?
no I am not!
what was i supposed to do?  when you did not show up saturday, i tried to call. your phone is not working.
i do not have a phone.
i drove over and you were gone.
i can not leave the house?
last time you were gone for a week!
did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
no.  i was going to let you do that.
he is not spending the summer in tahoe.
who are you, anyway?  i do not even know you.
you will know me by the time we are through.
I am not going!
I will get your bag.
mom, tell him I am not going.  you already promised me!
you have everything?
i did say he could go.
let's go.
I am not going!
you do not have a choice.
mom...please.
george --
he is not spending the entire summer with another kid in tahoe.  if he leaves, i will follow him up there and i will drag him home by his nose ring.  he can hate me.  you can hate me.  he can try to kill me while i sleep.  you can call the police.  you can call your husband or your attorney, but sam is spending the summer with me.  he is my son.  he is sixteen.  that is it.
your nose ring comes out of your nose. if you have got them in your nipples, they come out, too.  and there is no make-up at my house.  no glue sniffing.  huffing. no pills, no grass.
if you hit me, I will call the police.
you have worn out your welcome at this house, sam.  i will not ever hit you.  this may well be the worst three months of your life, but you have earned it.  so, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck.  now.
I will hate you forever.
you can not even begins to know how much i hate my father.  think of it as a family tradition.
are you totally insane?!
i almost saw catalina.
I am hungry!  where is my dinner?  who ate my dinner?  huh?  who is in trouble now?
hi.
hey.
what are you doing here?
they are trying to make me spend the summer here.  I am leaving in the morning.
where to?
I am supposed to be in tahoe.
your dad's really going to build his house?
i do not know.
well, if you do not go, i guess I will see you.
you should stay.
i do not know.
where is your dad?
he jumped into the ocean.
tell him i said "hi".
probably in the bible.
goodnight.
what are you doing?!
i warned you yesterday.
do not touch me!  you can not touch me!
he is a freak.
you look better without make-up.
i can not even take a shower here.
come over to my house whenever you want. I will tell my mom.
i might not stay, anyway.
I will get your back.
no.  that is okay.
do you remember me from when you lived here?
yeah.
your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
really?
i wanted him to marry her.
why?
turn over.
josh and i are going to south coast. wanna ride?  maybe see a movie?
no thanks.
do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
no.
get the inkling, sam.  I am getting tired of your attitude.
i hate turkey.
no you don't.
i want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.
why?
it bugs me.
you snore at night.  that bugs me.  can i take you out?
your brothers are right.  it was the most god-awful smell I have ever had my nose around.
we are fine.  turkey sandwiches.
well, for later then.
it makes me sad.
what?
i used to live here.
but you hated four out of the five you did.
i was here six years.  and i only hated two.
which?
the first and the last.
i do not even like turkey sandwiches. what kind of pizza?
sam's favorite.
i was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has.  that I am happy today.
what have you been before today?
it was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. it was simple, whatever it was.  then i started thinking about the last time i felt this good.  it is been a long time.
do you remember?
the only time i can think of for sure, i was holding onto sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves.
you head was pressed against my chest.  i could feel your heart racing.  and i remember i kissed your hair.
we have it on video!  was that when?  my parents were down for his sixth birthday! i remember that.
what is it?
I am fine.  nothing.  I will drop by your lunch tomorrow.
i do not know.
I am going to take a walk.  i need some money.
you will have money when you work.
you are so predictable.
no one would blame me if i left!
I would blame you.  i want you here.
I am not doing it!
it will be fine.
why do not you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
I would rather sell my nuts to a castrati.
i do not beg.
and i do not take a shower in the middle of the yard.
i can promise you complete privacy.
you can not promise me anything!  you do not have anything to promise!  you live in a garage!  you do not have cable!  you are not hooked up to the internet because you do not even own a computer!  you do not have a job!
if you had a stupid phone or i could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
you will have money when you work for it.
is alyssa home?
she is out with a friend.
oh...do you know when she will be home?
she did not really say.
oh...okay.
sam?
uh huh.
i did not recognize you!
I am sorry.
alyssa said you do not even have plumbing over there.
not a shower.
we have eaten.
is lois still here?  I am starved.
I will make you something.
it will take you like twenty, thirty minutes.
does alyssa know?
nothing.
you got any weed?
you got the money?
ah!  oh....
i know there is an explanation.
mr. dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
check the permits.  it was built as a guesthouse.  it is a legally rentable unit grandfathered when south laguna was incorporated.
thanks for the shower.
i want you both to stay.
come over anytime you need to, sam.
thanks, I would like that.  thank you.
I am surprised he has not left.
i have not forced him to work.  i only wet him down once.  why would he leave?
I am leaving.
hey...hey!
where are you going?
i do not know.
when are you going to be back?
i do not know.
well, until you know, you can not go.
oh, okay.
do you think it is odd your kids do not hug you?
should i?
it would worry me.
if i let everything that should worry me, worry me, I would be dead from worry.
what would you be if you asked adam and ryan to run in now and hug you?
I would be you.
what is your deal with alyssa?
do not even...i'm there.
i was not sure.
she would not even fucking go out with until she was sixteen.  i mean, that is not even a rule, just her own thing.  she like figures things out on her own and then that is it.
he already knows everything about what he can not do.  you can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
I am thinking it is too weird now.
it is not breakfast yet.
i dreamed about your house last night.
finished or unfinished?
it was perfect, george.  amazing.  it was so real.
did not you once dream you could lick people well, though?
that was not a dream.  that was sam.
oh...with his ear infection!
my tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
go in there and lick his attitude.
the antibiotics were not working.  it is what i believe, george.
I have been wrong a lot in my life.
hindsight.  it is like foresight without a future.
with your hands or your tongue?
you are not well.
mr. stevens?
I have been dreading you.
bob larson.  do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
a violation?
oh, yes.
and if i enclosed it?
an exhaust system or a window is code.
a sink?
allowed outside the enclosed area.
where is it?
a friend of yours is here.
did you got through my pants?
i might have a solution.
i hate to ask about a window.
i flushed it down the toilet.
i assume you will fill the...uh, window, with glass?
if that is what it takes.
I have been using since i was twelve! you are all so unbelievably stupid.  you did not give a shit about anything i did until now!
I will apologize for everything but today...today i give a shit.
you are too fucking late.
the gloves on the table are for you.
you can not make me do a thing.
sit down for a second.
no.
oh, so you are in the big shit now!  child abuse.  people go to prison for what you just did to me.
my dad used to play a game.  i never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
i was holding for someone.  that was not even mine.
the game was to make me smaller than he was.  no matter what.  he could be almost invisible as a human being, but i had to be smaller.  so if i got good grades, i was a pussy for not playing football.  if i cut my hair for him, it was not short enough.  if i shaved it, i looked like a psycho.  i never won the game.  not once. and if he could not make me smaller with words...
I will have to pay him back.
i will not ever hit you.  i do not want you smaller.  i want you to be happy.  you are not.  not here with me. not home with your mother.  not up in tahoe.  not alone.  not anywhere.  you are what i was most of my life, sam. i see it in your eyes.  in your sleep. in your answer to everything.  you are barely alive.
I am not even listening.
you know that great thing, though?  is that change can be so constant you do not even feel the difference until there is one.  it can be so slow that you do not even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.  or it can just blow you away.  make you something different in an instant.  it happened to me.
twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are.  this is the end of it, sam.  I am going to build something of me here that i can be proud to give to you.
don't.  i do not want it.
do whatever you want with it.  i do not care.  all i want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
we have not build shit.  you are just tearing down your father.
try it.  it feels good.
why do we have to get up and eat with you this early?
i just thought it would be nice.
are you going to see sam again?
i thought i might stop by.
all day again?
not all day.  I will be home after lunch.
you can go back to bed...or lois might let you go swimming.
i wanna be with you today.
oh, honey.  there is not much to do there. i mean, it is all work.
we can work.
ryan, would you rather swim or work?
can we really help build a house?
if she is not up, you can use my shower.
thank you.
you are here early today.
we are getting out of the ground today.
huh?
i can use your mom's.
I am okay.
not really.  no.  kinda.  he got busted?
his parents took his car.  they are making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
really?
he asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
he can peddle over anytime he wants to for it.
this is serious!  i do not have my license.  he was my ride.
I am sorry.  I am just here to shower.
I have seen lots of people.  it is not a big thing for me.
hand me a towel.  I am getting out.
I am coming in.
i do not want you to!
we are not going to do anything.
why are you so stupid?
why are you so uptight?
i do not even...what do you mean?  i do not even know what that means.
it means I am going to shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
hand me a towel.  hand me a towel.
i thought you would be up with the sun.
my stupid back.
do you need anything?  I will go to the pharmacy.  i have some demerol at home.
no, i'm...thanks.  i took something.
where is sam?
he will not use my shower.  i do not get it.
you brought your kids?
i kind of said that maybe they could do something.  help.  I am sorry.  they really wanted to come.  i really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  i do not think they will be too much trouble.
I will find something that will not kill them.
or wound.  let them keep their eyes and fingers.
you are a good mother.
do you need help?
i think so.
i woke up this morning at three and could not fall back asleep.  everyday i think i see more of sam than I have seen in years.
sam!
what is that for?
mom said i should.
oh.
i would have anyway.
hi, alyssa.
hi, mom.
you are so nice to let sam use your shower.
he is got a standing invitation.
i brought a few of my own.
someone stop her!
it is been a while.
this was my very first slow dance.
did you know him before you knew dad?
since seventh grade.
tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
i smiled at him.
watch out for the smile, boys.
let's see if you have gotten any better.
oh, I am worse.  much, much worse.
i took some of your vicodin.
i know.  why?
i like how it feels not to feel.
i know the feeling.
how do you become something you are not?
what would you like to be?
what I am not.
what are you now?
nothing.
that is not true.
see, that is the thing...i am what i say i am.
i know parts of who you are.
what do you know about me?
when you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment.  but then she met peter and skipped the idea of renting.
he is got nothing to do with me.
i could not imagine how i could compete with him for any part of you.  so, i didn't.  he wanted you to have his last name...i let him even take that.
he was a prick when i was six, and he is a prick today.
i wish you had told me then.
I am telling you now.
i gave up on you.
I would be in tahoe having fun if you had given up.
what would you be doing now?
getting high, i guess.
if i asked you to stop, would you?
i have not used anything for two days. I am trying.
I am proud of you, sam.
do not be.  and hide whatever that new drug is you have.  i like it.
are you talking?
i was just thinking about my mom.  she would not leave him.  i remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses.  i mean it was dark outside and in.  but we never talked about it.
sun glasses?
to hide a black eye.
why would not she leave?
i think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
i would have killed him.
everything would have been better if you had.  you would have liked your grandmother. and there would be a girl out there that would have her mother.  i remember reading about her in the paper.  they could not find her father and her mother was dead. i still feel guilty about that.
do you ever wish you had done it?
i loved him too much.
after everything he did to you and your mom?
after everything.
that is so weird...
how many bedrooms will your house have?
three.
so put your plans of my room in the trash.
i do not think dad wants you home.
adam, that is not true!
yes, it is.
would you stop being ridiculous?  your father wants sam home as much as i do.
to shave your chest?
we should take a vacation.
the biggest waste of time since television.
do you remember anything I have said that was not negative?
I would love to drive through new england in the fall.
sooner than the fall.
after the kids are back in school.
lois will stay with them.  or we can pawn them off on your parents.
I am helping george build his house.
what?
I have been helping for the last few days. weeks.  sam's working.  i told you sam was working.  i mean, he really is.
good.  that was the plan.  we could not stand him and george needed help.
i can not go right now.
you can not go because of sam?
we have not been away together for three years.  what difference does a few months make?
you can not go with me because of sam?
sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  once in a while he even talks to me.  i want to be around for that.
so am i, robin.  I am working at something, too.  I am even talking.  do you want to be around for it?
i was talking about our marriage.
i know.
what is the point of this?
does everything have to have a point?
it is freakish.  i do not get it.  I am not really supposed to touch you, but i can look.
are you sure you are totally into guys?
what are you talking about?
josh said...
I am not gay.
i was wondering.
you are driving me crazy!  do you know what it is like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
not really.
you are off, you know?  you are way, way off.
i thought i was helping you.
it would help me if i could kiss you.
no, i don't...no.  i thought we were just friends.
what you think, you know, does not have much to do with reality.  i mean, i hope I am not the first to say that about you.
okay, but then we will just be friends. okay?
okay.  i guess.
why is that?
just, i mean, well, you are here every single day.
he is at work while I am here.
i guess I would just be jealous if i were him.
well, he does not need to worry.
if my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I would worry.
he is not the type to worry.
nothing r, okay?
enough for drinks, popcorn and candy!
and video games after!
home after.  will you come in and say "hi"?
maybe you should not come everyday.
no.  why?  i like to be with sam.
it is just that there is less that adam and ryan can do anymore.  I would hate to have them bored.
i know they are not much help, but they love coming here, george.
how much time do they get to spend with their dad?
what is it with this?  they would not spend less time with peter if they lived here!  he has no time!
do you know alyssa thinks something is up with us?  she is giving me crap about being away from peter and now you are trying to do the same thing!  what no one seems to realize is that peter is not there!  he is not there!  and when he is, he isn't!  so, if you do not want me here, or you do not want my kids here, just tell me, george.  I will stop coming.  but it will not be because of peter.  it will be because you asked me to stop.  say what you need to say, because I am not leaving until i hear it.
I would rather you not be here.
i thought we were helping.
i can hire workers to help me.
nothing is going on with us, is it?
going on?
when i picked you up from the train station...what you said.
what did i say?
that thing about i was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  what was that?
that was the truth.
you have never said that before.
I will say a lot of things I have never said before.  it is habit.
it sounded like a pick-up line.
i can not pick you up.
I am married.
you bit my finger.
if i were not married?
let's not do this, okay?
i need to know.
you need to know what?  do i still love you?
that sounds pathetic, does not it?
what are you doing home?
i always felt i could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me.
you never really trusted me.
you live a fabulous life, robin.
despite you.
i never asked for more.
that is the problem.
please do not leave me.
where are the kids?
sam took them to a movie.
I will be in the bedroom.
can you keep sam straight?
he is not gay.  i found out purely by accident, believe me.
i mean drugs.  i thought you said he was?
he would not use around me.  i do not like any of it.
you are a good girl.
i need to ask you something, mr. nelson.
you have to ask like that?
i want you to try something with me, okay?
I have taken a lot of morphine.  oral morphine...for my back.  can i wait till i can say no and sound convincing?
did you feel anything?
maybe your tongue...i do not know, my mouth is numb.  why did you do that?
my mother would die.
let's shut up and not kill her.
it is not what i was expecting.
what did you think it would be?
i do not know...  more like when i kissed sam.
mom?
here, honey!
i put him to work.
what is wrong?
i could not get it to go down.
and why was the alarm on?
oh...i set it to see if it would work.
you would better call and cancel.
oh god, we do not want the police!
that is how you get things right is to always try and never give up.  huh, mom?
i guess it depends on what you give up on.
there were no pg's.  so i just gave them money to play games.
can you stay for dinner?
depends on what I would give up on.
go tell your father we are eating.
dad's home, already?
in the bedroom.
he is not there.
he is here.  check the bathroom.
i checked everywhere.  he is not there.
what are you doing up so early?
i could not sleep last night.
I am supposed to be mad at you, but I am not.
why?  what do you mean?
uh...using josh like that.
dad's disappeared!
he was there and then he wasn't!
he has not called?
who are you?
is your back still killing you?
i did not think you would come today.
i kept thinking about it, what you said... i hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
no.  mostly me.
peter left me yesterday.
left you?
no goodbye.  no fuck you.  no 'are you in love with george?'
what did he say?
'i'll be in the bedroom.'
back.  neck.  back.
what?
the door was open.
i do not know what I am doing.
i would not let adam or ryan see you doing it.
dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for christmas lights with a switch inside?
absolutely.  have him put it on a separate line.  at christmas, we will pact it so full of lights, we will make god wear sunglasses.
i could die.
so could i.
are you going to kiss me?
it is not my back that is killing me.
on the handlebars or your shoulders?
are you afraid of heights?
hey, i can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
what?
it is just a joke.  a stupid joke.
i could use the money.
i just wanted to know where mom was?
oh.  sorry.
it is okay.
she needs to be alone, i think.
because dad left?
she is a little sad, is all.
i do not even care if he ever comes back.
hello?
where are you?  you are driving me crazy, waiting like this.  i want you in me now!
do not move!
I am an idiot to have you up there.
i better get the kids home.
not a perfect day.
you look better than ever.
i do not think mom cares that much that my...that peter left.
she seemed upset.
what is wrong with your back?
i mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what?  because those pills you are taking are for a lot of pain.  and you are going through them quick.
are you taking them still?
no, but i count them.  in a sock is not new, you know?
i do not know what that means.  what kind of problem?
the kind where there is not really an answer.
i still do not know what that means.
i wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  maybe everything happens for a reason.  something bad to force something good.
i do not know what that means.  what kind of problem?
the kind where there is not really an answer.
i still do not know what that means.
i wanted you here so we could have a few months together.  maybe everything happens for a reason.  something bad to force something good.
and you told mom today?
yes.
we are all dying from the start.  i just got picked for advanced placement.
you lied to me!
i would have lied to me if i thought I would believe it.
this was all for your sake, was not it? having me here?  trying to get me to like you.
i never tried to get you to like me.  i tried to get you to love me.
well, congratulations!  you fucking pulled it off!
is alyssa here?
it is midnight.  what is the matter, sam?
nothing.  my dad's dying.  i really need to talk to alyssa.
it is my day off.  i thought I would help with the plumbing.
i need you to do me a favor.
god, you look like crap, george.
i want you to find someone for me.
he will not leave my room.
will he talk to me?
no.
mr. stevens.  one of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height.  he is filed to have construction stopped immediately.
it is thirty feet.
well, if it is, we have a problem.
i have the permit.
after your last extension request and with design review and the board of adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
to the patio and one north-facing window...  and six inches to the height.
why do you let your dog crap on his lawn, day after day?
i do not let him.  he just loves to.
that would take weeks.
months.
I am going to bed.
has he eaten anything at all?
I would be more comfortable if he slept in the guestroom.
I would be more comfortable if you had not slept with josh.  and george would be more comfortable if he were not dying.
you hate your father.
if he tricked me into loving him, is what i meant.
you would hate him for the trick.
not if what he left me was real.
atonement.
who are all these people?
i do not wanna go.
he asked where you were!  he wants you with him.
i do not wanna go.
hey.
hey.
you got a dog?
it is not ours.  it is george's.
I have missed you guys.
why?
and we got to take all the old paint off all the doors and then george taught us how to stain everything and he even let me choose the color i liked best!  and he said he loved me!
we did a lot of the wiring too.
with dale.  oh, and i got to drill a hole into a board to put the wire through!
i do not wanna go, sam.
here.
do you know anything about building a house?
no.
i guess i could teach you some things.
okay.
i hardly recognize you with a beard.
that was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
i feel in love with george again.
where are you?!
floating to catalina.
what?
he said he heard hammering.
who?
mr. dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
he wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
what are you talking about?
I am sixteen years old.  I am underage. how could i possibly threaten you?
what the fuck?
everything happens for a reason.  that is what my dad said.
then you tell me, what just happened?
the payoff.
do you guys feel like painting?
what color?
red.
i love red!  that is my favorite color!
you do not look like you.
either do you.
i thought i might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.
do you like red?
when does george get to come see his house?
it is so beautiful.
you are sure about this?
yeah.
you could keep it and rent it out?
this is what he wants.
i read the letter.  you read the will. he wants you to keep it.  to live in it some day.
then maybe this is not what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  maybe it is what i want.
