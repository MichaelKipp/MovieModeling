thank you.
have a nice day.
invitations: the museum gala.
no.
the fitzwilliam botanical garden annual fundraiser.
no.
the hinchberger wedding.
let me think...  hordes of men in tuxedos.  everyone's droning.  ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
i'll send your regrets.  honestly, why must i even bother?
because, if you don't know about society, you don't have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
your ex-wife.
i know who she is.  take a message.
i don't like her.
i wouldn't mention the following, except he was very insistent.  it's obviously some sort of prank...
what?
a gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but i assured him...
what gentleman, maria?
a mister... seymour butts.
"under the bleachers"... by seymour butts.
pardon me?  i'm afraid i don't...
cancel lunch.  make reservations at campton place for me and mr. butts.
hey there, nickie.
conrad, what a surprise.  gesundheit.
happy birthday, man.
"seymour butts."  i never get tired of that one.
that's why it's a classic.  come on, man... how 'bout a hug... ?
they gave me a free jacket at the door.
they'll be wanting it back.
not after i'm done with it.  actually, i've been here.  in grad-school i bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
which grad-school?
you look good.
so do you.  and to think i was worried...
about me?
how long's it been?  since mom died... four years?  how are you?
never better.
elizabeth?
divorced.  remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in sausalito.
too bad, i liked her.  so, you're all alone in the house of pain?
i redecorated.  what about you?
nowhere in particular.  don't you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
connie... what brings you here?  is everything alright?
yeah.
you need anything?
no.
really?
i don't need anything from you.  i was laying on a beach somewhere in spain, naked, and, it hit me -- nickie's birthday.  so, here i am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. not necessarily in that order.
for you.
you shouldn't have.
call that number.
"consumer recrreation services." what, do they make golf clubs?
trust me.  call that number.
why?
they make your life fun.  their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
fun?
you've heard of it.  you've seen other people having it.  they're an entertainment service, but more than that.
this isn't an escort service?
it's a profound life experience.
like a stroke?
call them.  trust me.
tell me you'll call.
okay.
will you?
i said i would...
but, will you?
are you still on mediction?
why would you say that?
i thought you'd like this.  best thing i ever did.  if you don't want to do it, don't...
i'll call them, okay?
it doesn't matter...
i'm going to call.
do it for you.
okay, okay... okay?  i just... you know i hate surprises.
i know...
dinner's in the oven.
thank you.  goodnight.
you did?  how is he?
okay.  i think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
well... send my love, if you see him again.
jim feingold, v.p., e.d.a. engineering and data analysis.
i'm not quite sure how this works. my brother...
oh, here we go...
v-a-n... o-r-t-o-n...  a gift from conrad van orton. interesting...
what is?
your brother was a client with our london branch.  we do a sort of informal scoring.  his numbers were outstanding.  sure you're not hungry at all... ? tung hoy, best in chinatown...
no, thank you.
you need to fill out those forms. application, psych-tests: m.m.p.i. and t.a.t.  for the financial questionnaire, don't answer anything you don't feel like.  we'll run a t.r.w....
i don't write the questions.  i just review them.
what's all this for?
we want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
no, i mean, what is it for?  what are you selling?
oh... it's a game.
a game?
tailored specifically to each participant.  think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
what kind of vacation?
it's different every time.
humor me with specifics.
we provide whatever's lacking.
and if nothing's lacking?
may i make two suggestions... ?
do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
first, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing.  second, you don't have to decide today.  take the silly tests, fill out the forms.  one day, the game begins.  you either love it or hate it.  decide then.  we're like an experimental book-of-the-month- club; drop out at any time with no further obligation.  that was my sales pitch.
how long will these take?
an hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
physical?
cursory examination.  turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  you'll be out of here in no time.
sorry to keep you waiting.
don't worry.  it's been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
it's all down to this...
one guarantee.  payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
you mean, i don't like it, he doesn't pay?
it's never happened.  we've never had an unsatisfied customer.
you mean, <u>dis</u>satisfied.
that's right -- you're a left-brain word fetishist.
i only mention it because i took the test this afternoon, down on montgomery street.
did you?  kudos.
did you play recently?
hm?  no, about a year ago.  i was working out of los angeles.
i've heard good things about their london branch.  you have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
you want to know what it is?  what it's all about?  john.  chapter nine.  verse twenty-five.
i, uh... haven't been to sunday school in years...
"whereas once i was blind, now i can see."  night, nick.  best of luck.
anything wrong... ?
nothing.  nothing at all.
is everything alright?
fine.
i've finished for the evening.  will you be needing anything else?
no, thank you.  goodnight.
goodnight then.
i wasn't expecting you.
wanted to wish you luck.  not that you'll need it.
attractive...
don't ask.
i checked it personally.
you promised you'd meet projections, alan.  a dollar sixty per share you said.  so, i don't think this is so surprising a visit.
projections were far too optimistic.
admittedly...
our e.p.s. was one fifty last quarter.  we're up eight cents per share.
but, the expectation was ten.  and, in this case, expectation is everything.
will you really hold me to it over <u>pennies</u>?
my stock's falling.  isn't yours? those pennies are costing me millions.
the stock will turn.
it probably will.  in fact, i'd go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  why should i settle for that?
because it's fair.  give me next quarter.  if you still feel this way, vote your shares...
you're talking tomorrow.  today is what counts.
you intractable son-of-a-bitch.  if your father could see you now...
what?
your father was a friend.  goddamn it... i watched you grow up.  how do you end up treating me like this?
it is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  just because you went fishing with my father, i should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
now, look...
i'll be done in a minute.  you misspoke before.  you're not "stepping down."  i'm taking you out at the knees.  the whole point is to prove that you're not deciding anything anymore.  i'm firing you. action's taken.  confidence restored. stock goes up.  i sell my shares.
there is no baer/grant publishing without alan baer.
remember daniel grant?  do they say, "without daniel grant, there is no baer/grant publishing?"  he's gone sailing, alan.  he's out there enjoying his golden years, probably wondering where you are.
i could fight you on this.
you could.  but, if i leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
i'm so sorry.
please, don't do that...
i apologize, sir, i'm having a bad day...
a bad month.  you did the exact same thing to me last week.
don't help me, just get more napkins. and soda water.
it was an accident.
terrific.  i now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
i said i was sorry...
christine!   mister van orton is a valued customer...
then, you kiss his ass.
you don't talk to me like that.
i apologized, i offered to help.
clean out your locker.
fine, dennis.  soon as i get my money for this week.
i'll be right with you.
pardon me... miss... ?
oh, no... you.
i'm not sure how this works.  do you have something for me... ?  i got this note...
what are you babbling about, psycho?
i want to know what's going on.  are you part of this?
what's going on?  i'm going on my second job this month, and now i'm going on unemployment.
excuse me, i need to explain...
don't explain.  fuck off.  goodbye.
what's with him?
i don't know... he fell.
do you know what to do?
i don't think he's breathing.
oh, god... !
don't just stand there, get help!
this can't be real...
he's pissing his pants.  is that real enough for you?  call 911!
alright... okay...
he's turning blue!
this is nuts.
what <u>is</u> your problem?
ten minutes ago, i'm looking forward to a quiet dinner.  i get a note...
let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
hold on...  they want your driver's license number.
you've got to be kidding.
what... is... happening... ?
i was trying to tell you... it's a game.
a game?
it's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  things like this. i'm really only now finding out myself.
what are you talking about?
the lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
you mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
i'm sorry, about this...
you should be.
there's got to be a flashlight.
i don't understand why they're getting you involved.
see you around.
where are you going?
home.
how do you know that's the way?
where'd you all go?  motherfucking frat boys.  you better hide.  is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
it was a gift... from my brother.
how thoughtful.  the gift of inconvenience.
long story.  i found this key in the mouth of a wooden harlequin.
never mind.
don't even think about it.
why not?
read what it says: "warning, do <u>not</u> attempt to open.  if elevator stops, use emergency... "
if there was one.
"... wait for help."  wait for help. i'm not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
i'll give you a boost.
you first.
this isn't an attempt to be gallant. if i don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
you pull me up.
it's much easier this way.  come on, step up...
no.
please...
i'm not wearing underwear.  okay? there, i said it.  satisfied.
oh.  fine.
there's a ladder here.
my hero.  let's go.
i'll wait.
it's not like anyone could actually open it.
this is c.r.s.
what's c.r.s.?
consumer recreation services.  it's their building.  they...
don't panic.  when security gets here, we simply explain what happened...
they'll love that.
yes... well...
you deserted me.
you're a grown man.  i'm not responsible for you.
you're the one who started running.
me?  you're the one who... !  shit!
there goes a thousand dollars.
your <u>shoes</u> cost a thousand dollars?
that one did.
... two hundred dollars a toe.
never did catch your name.
nicholas.  nicholas van orton.
nicholas van orton?  what are you, a czar?
that's classic.
why... ?
we hang down here and drop.  the garbage'll break our fall.
i think not.
where are we going?
that tall, bright building.  near there.
what exactly do you do?
investment banking.  moving money from place to place.
nice.
hm?  oh, yes.
a fresh shirt...
if this was my office, i wouldn't keep that closed.
i don't spend much time looking out the window.  i'll call you a taxi.
i know the owner of campton place.  i could talk to him in the morning.
don't.  it was a shitty job anyway. i overreacted.
goodnight.
i don't think i've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
the maitre d' called you christine.
right.  call me christy.
goodnight, christy.  it was nice meeting you.
give me an address so i can send your shirt back.
keep it.
i have a confession to make.  someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
seriously?  what did they say?
they said five hundred.  i said six. they said the man in the gray flannel suit.  i think i said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
ah, mr. van orton.  here you go...
have we met?
show mr. van orton to his room.
the key?
hm?
is there a room key?
didn't i give you two?
no, you didn't...
what the fuck... ?!
why are you following me?
i don't know what you're talking about.  i'm just driving...
look... what i'm doing is none of your business...
is alan baer "the game?"  is that what this is?
friend... why don't you back off.
hey... !
nice touch.  does the game use real bullets... ?
what's happened...
follow me.
nicholas...
that you've involved conrad... is unforgivable.  i am now your enemy.
are you finished?
no.  this is my lawyer, samuel sutherland.  i thought you two should meet.
we met, this morning.  i signed the termination contract for baer/grace. i accepted your settlement, nicholas. you were right.  i'm going sailing.
how concerned should i be?
it was a misunderstanding.
someone's playing hardball.  it's complicated.  can i ask a favor?
you know you can.
find out about a company called c.r.s.  consumer recreation services.
sounds like they make tennis rackets. what do we know?
just what i told you.
nothing else?
christ... i can't believe it... invisible ink?
you're joking.
it's what they do.  it's like... being toyed with by a bunch of...  depraved children.
very well.  if you tell me not to worry, i shan't.
sam...  thank you.
mr. van orton... ?
ilsa... you're alright?
yes. what do you mean?  what's wrong?
did the alarm go off?  the house... they... you didn't see... ?
i don't know what you're talking about.  what's happened?
there's been a break in.  lock this door and stay here.  don't move a muscle.
tell me where we're going.
just drive, man.  it's fucking nuts!
what's this all about, connie?
shhhhhhh.  wait... wait...
what are you doing?
they're methodical.  they're nothing if they're not that.
who?
c.r.s.  who do you think?  jesus h., thank your lucky charms.  to think what i almost got you into.
yeah, almost...
you dodged a bullet.
how do you mean, exactly?
they fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  and then, just when you think it's done, that's when the <u>real</u> fucking begins.
slow down, take a breath...
it doesn't stop, nick.  i paid the bill, i gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  they won't leave me alone...
what have they been doing to you?
everything.  i'm a goddamn human-pinata...
calm down.  why would they keep playing after you paid?
you think i know?  i paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
it's them.  they did this.
it's a flat tire.  that's all.
how do you know?
we're going to figure this out.  get a grip on yourself.
okay... okay.
the phone's dead.
really?
do you know how to change a tire?
no.  do you?  can't be too hard, can it?  i don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
how did those... ?
you're part of it...
what?  connie...
no!  you're one of them.  of course, it makes perfect sense!
no, it doesn't!  those keys were put there.  i didn't even know...
you're behind this, aren't you?  you and your sick friends.  well, make it stop!
listen to yourself.   why would i do anything like what you're describing?
because you hate me.  because you had to be here, when mom died.  because you had to do it alone.  well, don't you think if i'd known... i'd've been here too.  i'd have been here...
stop this.  it's not true...
i'm sorry, christ, i'm sorry!  how many more times do i have to say i'm sorry before you forgive me... ?
stop it!
i need the police.
let's get you dried off first.  i might have some clothes below.
you know, these fit... perfectly.
they were my husband's.  my late husband... may he rest in peace.
i've been so lonely.
i can't tell you how <u>not</u> interested i am.
don't be nervous.  they said you'd be nervous.
don't take another step.
isn't this what you like?  they told me you had a thing for boats.
first they try to kill me, now you?  put your damn clothes back on.
he hasn't called back.
what about the house?
illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
attempted murder.
what makes you ask?
i'm not sure.
all the time i've known you, you've never once asked about him.
he came to my mind recently, that's all.
your mother thought he was a good man.  he worked very hard.  what i remember most was his manner was so... slight.  it was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
was he morose, or...?  i mean...
no.  what happened... no one expected it.
sometimes i wonder how much of him there is in me.
not much, i think.
i'm just like him.
you're not like him at all.  i don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
did you worry about him?
nobody worried about your father.
what are you doing here?
can we talk?
it's okay, dad.
didn't think i'd ever see you again.
come here...
what is it?
is this you?
where'd you get this?
it was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  you're saying it's not you?
i think i would remember.  what makes you think it's me?
well... the red bra.
okay.
i thought...
do you mind if i sit?
sure.  you alright?  is this still that contest you're in...
i'm tired.  i'm sorry, i should go. i've been enough of a nuisance.
let me go get some clothes on. we'll talk, okay?  be right back.
want anything to drink?
you?
yeah.  first communion.  aren't i a little angel?
take the picture out.
what's wrong?
take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
i don't...
they're watching.
wha... ?
not here!  they can see.
no!  i'm sick of this...
nicholas...
what is this!?
god, wake up, it's a con!
what are you doing... ?
get out.
i could've handed you to them.  they find me now, i'm dead...
get out of my car!
you don't have a choice.  no one else is going to tell you what's going on.
you can talk while i drive us to the police.
no cops.  i've got a warrant out. mail fraud.  they'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
who are "they?"
i don't know, nobody does.  i'm an employee.
then, what good are you?
i know things... like who you can trust.  like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
that's a lie...
yeah?  i was your waitress on your birthday.  connie told you about c.r.s. that day, remember?  i was already playing my part, <u>before</u> you started the game.
it wasn't his fault.  he thought it was his only way back.  they fleeced him real good.
how?  how could they have gotten anything?
they did the same to him as they did to you.
what are you talking about... ?
why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
overseas operator?  please dial allgemeine bank, zurich.
they don't care about you anymore. alive or dead is the same, as long as they bury you deep enough.
what did you say?
i didn't say anything.
my name's not christine.  it's not my real...
who the fuck cares?
it's just money.  you should be glad you're alive.
it might be best if we didn't talk.
all i mean is... someone like you...
how many times have you done this? i'm interested.
what?
scams, con games.  how many?
i don't know.  a lot.
whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  you ruined people's lives.
who is it?
what do we do?
who is it?
what do you mean?  i checked them myself.  i made the calls...
mm... i wouldn't worry about it.
what... what do you mean?
it's out of your hands.
no money, no identification or passport.  you are in a fix.  what did happen to you?
well, where to begin.  it's complicated...
it always is.
what happened was, i'm on vacation, alone... i was robbed, at gunpoint. they hit me and ran.  two men, a few blocks away.  they took my wallet, money... all of it.  so...
robbed?
yes.
have you gone to the police?
i don't speak spanish.  all i need is to get back... just enough for that.
we'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  as far as money goes... can i make a suggestion?  you say you were mugged?
yes.
and, they didn't take that watch?
how much is it?  a few thousand, at least.  a rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
yes, very lucky.
what's the trouble?
you're here for conrad van orton? i'm the hotel manager...
pleasure to meet you, i'd like to see my brother, thank you.
your brother.  will you come with me?
what's this about?
it's a private matter, for you... i think you'll be more comfortable...
where's my brother?
there were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  we did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
his behavior... ?
he couldn't, or refused to pay.  we extended credit...
look, where is he?!
there was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said.  the police took him.  they left this address, in case anyone...
i need your car, elizabeth.
what happened to you, nick?  i mean, look at yourself...
i know, look at me, well...  what happened?  i don't know.  i don't even really know.  i have some things to try to take care of... i need the car a little while.
of course you can have it if you need it.  can i get you something to eat?
the last few days, um... i've been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  i want to tell you... i'm starting to understand why you left me.  i've been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... i want to apologize, for all of it.  for shutting you out, for not being there.  i...  anyway, i hope you can forgive me.
there's nothing to forgive.
it would mean a lot to me... if you and i could be friends.  if i could have you back in my life... in some small way.  it would be important.
of course, nick...
it's just a t.v.  he's just an actor.
yes.
i'll explain someday.
i hope.
get rid of them.
hey, everyone -- snack time!  here... here you go...
look, it was just a job.  nothing personal, ya know?  i play my part, improvise a little.  that's what i'm good at.
i'm tired of dealing with peons.  i need to get to whoever's in charge.
nobody knows, pal.  nobody gets the big picture...  jason, tommy, cut it out!
goddamnit, why do they do that?
how do i find them?  their offices are empty.
they own the whole building.  they just move from floor to floor.
they know you... you worked for them. you can get me in.
no, i can't.  i'm sorry and all, but...
tell them the cops are after you... tell them you've got to talk to someone, i'm threatening to blow the whistle.
what whistle?  there's no fucking whistle.  this is fucking dangerous.
drive in.
what are you gonna do anyway?  you won't get your money back.
i don't want money.  i'm pulling back the curtain.  i'm here to meet the wizard.
you don't need me...
shut up.  cuff him to the rail.
where?
i told you, they hired me over the phone.  i never met anyone.
where'd you pick up your checks?
it was a different floor then...
guess!
like, this way... sort of...
what are you <u>doing</u> here?
i'm back from the dead.
nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
get us out of here...
nicholas...
get us out!
what do you think you're doing?
you tell me... i want to know who's behind this.  who did this to me... how, why... ?
how deluded can you be?  there's no <u>why</u>...
who's responsible?!
it wasn't you.  it wasn't personal...
you call them...
it could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  tell them i'll kill you...
they won't...
they will!  you tell them if they don't come now, i will shoot you!
where'd you get that... ?
... what... ?
that gun.  that... that's not automatic.  the guard had an automatic...
what the fuck are you... ?
where'd you get that gun?
it's mine...
we searched the house.
guess you missed it.
just... wait.  just wait!  okay... please, i'm not kidding anymore...
he's got a gun.  everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  real situation!  ... damn it...
what are you doing?
nicholas, this is fake.  it's all part of the game...
fuck you.
listen very carefully, i'm telling the truth... this is the game.  this was all the game.
bullshit.  they killed him. feingold, fisher, whoever... they shot him...
no, now wait... think about it.  what did you see... ?
i saw them kill him!
what did you <u>really see</u>?  this whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  please, you've got to believe me...  he's got a gun, with real bullets!
stop talking to them!
okay... okay...  i put it down.  now open that door. mister fisher's right on the other side of that door.  he's an actor...
stop talking...
nicholas...
shut up!
let me show you...
no!  you take another step, i'll shoot!  they're trying to kill me...
you're wrong.  you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. put that gun down.
think about it!  they followed you every step of the way.  there was always a safety net.  the taxi, there was a diver.  at my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
that's not true...
