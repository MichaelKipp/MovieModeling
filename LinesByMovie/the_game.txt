thank you.
have a nice day.
invitations: the museum gala.
no.
the fitzwilliam botanical garden annual fundraiser.
no.
the hinchberger wedding.
let me think...  hordes of men in tuxedos.  everyone's droning.  ludwell's trying to break the ice by reciting an off-color limerick...
I will send your regrets.  honestly, why must i even bother?
because, if you do not know about society, you do not have the satisfaction of avoiding it.
your ex-wife.
i know who she is.  take a message.
i do not like her.
i would not mention the following, except he was very insistent.  it is obviously some sort of prank...
what?
a gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but i assured him...
what gentleman, maria?
a mister... seymour butts.
"under the bleachers"... by seymour butts.
pardon me?  I am afraid i don't...
cancel lunch.  make reservations at campton place for me and mr. butts.
hey there, nickie.
conrad, what a surprise.  gesundheit.
happy birthday, man.
"seymour butts."  i never get tired of that one.
that is why it is a classic.  come on, man... how 'bout a hug... ?
they gave me a free jacket at the door.
they will be wanting it back.
not after I am done with it.  actually, I have been here.  in grad-school i bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
which grad-school?
you look good.
so do you.  and to think i was worried...
about me?
how long's it been?  since mom died... four years?  how are you?
never better.
elizabeth?
divorced.  remarried to some pediatrician or gynecologist, or pediatric gynaecologist, in sausalito.
too bad, i liked her.  so, you are all alone in the house of pain?
i redecorated.  what about you?
nowhere in particular.  do not you keep track of my whereabouts anymore?
connie... what brings you here?  is everything alright?
yeah.
you need anything?
no.
really?
i do not need anything from you.  i was laying on a beach somewhere in spain, naked, and, it hit me -- nickie's birthday.  so, here i am, four layovers, twenty-seven hours flying and one donkey ride later. not necessarily in that order.
for you.
you should not have.
call that number.
"consumer recrreation services." what, do they make golf clubs?
trust me.  call that number.
why?
they make your life fun.  their only guarantee is you will not be bored.
fun?
you have heard of it.  you have seen other people having it.  they are an entertainment service, but more than that.
this is not an escort service?
it is a profound life experience.
like a stroke?
call them.  trust me.
tell me you will call.
okay.
will you?
i said i would...
but, will you?
are you still on mediction?
why would you say that?
i thought you would like this.  best thing i ever did.  if you do not want to do it, don't...
I will call them, okay?
it does not matter...
I am going to call.
do it for you.
okay, okay... okay?  i just... you know i hate surprises.
i know...
dinner's in the oven.
thank you.  goodnight.
you did?  how is he?
okay.  i think he is into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
well... send my love, if you see him again.
jim feingold, v.p., e.d.a. engineering and data analysis.
I am not quite sure how this works. my brother...
oh, here we go...
v-a-n... o-r-t-o-n...  a gift from conrad van orton. interesting...
what is?
your brother was a client with our london branch.  we do a sort of informal scoring.  his numbers were outstanding.  sure you are not hungry at all... ? tung hoy, best in chinatown...
no, thank you.
you need to fill out those forms. application, psych-tests: m.m.p.i. and t.a.t.  for the financial questionnaire, do not answer anything you do not feel like.  we will run a t.r.w....
i do not write the questions.  i just review them.
what is all this for?
we want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
no, i mean, what is it for?  what are you selling?
oh... it is a game.
a game?
tailored specifically to each participant.  think of it as a great vacation, except you do not go to it, it comes to you.
what kind of vacation?
it is different every time.
humor me with specifics.
we provide whatever's lacking.
and if nothing's lacking?
may i make two suggestions... ?
do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
first, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing.  second, you do not have to decide today.  take the silly tests, fill out the forms.  one day, the game begins.  you either love it or hate it.  decide then.  we are like an experimental book-of-the-month- club; drop out at any time with no further obligation.  that was my sales pitch.
how long will these take?
an hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
physical?
cursory examination.  turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  you will be out of here in no time.
sorry to keep you waiting.
do not worry.  it is been terrific spending the entire day with your "crack team".
it is all down to this...
one guarantee.  payment's entirely at your brother's discretion and, as a gift, dependent on your satisfaction.
you mean, i do not like it, he does not pay?
it is never happened.  we have never had an unsatisfied customer.
you mean, dissatisfied.
that is right -- you are a left-brain word fetishist.
i only mention it because i took the test this afternoon, down on montgomery street.
did you?  kudos.
did you play recently?
hm?  no, about a year ago.  i was working out of los angeles.
I have heard good things about their london branch.  you have to admit, it sounds like some fantasy, role-playing nonsense.
you want to know what it is?  what it is all about?  john.  chapter nine.  verse twenty-five.
i, uh... have not been to sunday school in years...
"whereas once i was blind, now i can see."  night, nick.  best of luck.
anything wrong... ?
nothing.  nothing at all.
is everything alright?
fine.
I have finished for the evening.  will you be needing anything else?
no, thank you.  goodnight.
goodnight then.
i was not expecting you.
wanted to wish you luck.  not that you will need it.
attractive...
do not ask.
i checked it personally.
you promised you would meet projections, alan.  a dollar sixty per share you said.  so, i do not think this is so surprising a visit.
projections were far too optimistic.
admittedly...
our e.p.s. was one fifty last quarter.  we are up eight cents per share.
but, the expectation was ten.  and, in this case, expectation is everything.
will you really hold me to it over pennies?
my stock's falling.  is not yours? those pennies are costing me millions.
the stock will turn.
it probably will.  in fact, I would go so far as to say it almost certainly will, in time.  why should i settle for that?
because it is fair.  give me next quarter.  if you still feel this way, vote your shares...
you are talking tomorrow.  today is what counts.
you intractable son-of-a-bitch.  if your father could see you now...
what?
your father was a friend.  goddamn it... i watched you grow up.  how do you end up treating me like this?
it is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  just because you went fishing with my father, i should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
now, look...
I will be done in a minute.  you misspoke before.  you are not "stepping down."  I am taking you out at the knees.  the whole point is to prove that you are not deciding anything anymore.  I am firing you. action's taken.  confidence restored. stock goes up.  i sell my shares.
there is no baer/grant publishing without alan baer.
remember daniel grant?  do they say, "without daniel grant, there is no baer/grant publishing?"  he is gone sailing, alan.  he is out there enjoying his golden years, probably wondering where you are.
i could fight you on this.
you could.  but, if i leave without your signature, this agreement begins to disintegrate; benefits shrink, options narrow, compensations shrivel.
I am so sorry.
please, do not do that...
i apologize, sir, I am having a bad day...
a bad month.  you did the exact same thing to me last week.
do not help me, just get more napkins. and soda water.
it was an accident.
terrific.  i now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
i said i was sorry...
christine!   mister van orton is a valued customer...
then, you kiss his ass.
you do not talk to me like that.
i apologized, i offered to help.
clean out your locker.
fine, dennis.  soon as i get my money for this week.
I will be right with you.
pardon me... miss... ?
oh, no... you.
I am not sure how this works.  do you have something for me... ?  i got this note...
what are you babbling about, psycho?
i want to know what is going on.  are you part of this?
what is going on?  I am going on my second job this month, and now I am going on unemployment.
excuse me, i need to explain...
do not explain.  fuck off.  goodbye.
what is with him?
i do not know... he fell.
do you know what to do?
i do not think he is breathing.
oh, god... !
do not just stand there, get help!
this can not be real...
he is pissing his pants.  is that real enough for you?  call 911!
alright... okay...
he is turning blue!
this is nuts.
what is your problem?
ten minutes ago, I am looking forward to a quiet dinner.  i get a note...
let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
hold on...  they want your driver's license number.
you have got to be kidding.
what... is... happening... ?
i was trying to tell you... it is a game.
a game?
it is run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  things like this. I am really only now finding out myself.
what are you talking about?
the lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
you mean, the guy who turned blue and wet himself... ?
I am sorry, about this...
you should be.
there is got to be a flashlight.
i do not understand why they are getting you involved.
see you around.
where are you going?
home.
how do you know that is the way?
where did you all go?  motherfucking frat boys.  you better hide.  is your life so pathetic that this is something you are willing to pay for?
it was a gift... from my brother.
how thoughtful.  the gift of inconvenience.
long story.  i found this key in the mouth of a wooden harlequin.
never mind.
do not even think about it.
why not?
read what it says: "warning, do not attempt to open.  if elevator stops, use emergency... "
if there was one.
"... wait for help."  wait for help. I am not opening a door that specifically warns me not to.
are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
I will give you a boost.
you first.
this is not an attempt to be gallant. if i do not lift you, how are you going to get there?
you pull me up.
it is much easier this way.  come on, step up...
no.
please...
I am not wearing underwear.  okay? there, i said it.  satisfied.
oh.  fine.
there is a ladder here.
my hero.  let's go.
I will wait.
it is not like anyone could actually open it.
this is c.r.s.
what is c.r.s.?
consumer recreation services.  it is their building.  they...
do not panic.  when security gets here, we simply explain what happened...
they will love that.
yes... well...
you deserted me.
you are a grown man.  I am not responsible for you.
you are the one who started running.
me?  you are the one who... !  shit!
there goes a thousand dollars.
your shoes cost a thousand dollars?
that one did.
... two hundred dollars a toe.
never did catch your name.
nicholas.  nicholas van orton.
nicholas van orton?  what are you, a czar?
that is classic.
why... ?
we hang down here and drop.  the garbage'll break our fall.
i think not.
where are we going?
that tall, bright building.  near there.
what exactly do you do?
investment banking.  moving money from place to place.
nice.
hm?  oh, yes.
a fresh shirt...
if this was my office, i would not keep that closed.
i do not spend much time looking out the window.  I will call you a taxi.
i know the owner of campton place.  i could talk to him in the morning.
don't.  it was a shitty job anyway. i overreacted.
goodnight.
i do not think I have ever spent this much time with someone who did not even ask my name.
the maitre d' called you christine.
right.  call me christy.
goodnight, christy.  it was nice meeting you.
give me an address so i can send your shirt back.
keep it.
i have a confession to make.  someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
seriously?  what did they say?
they said five hundred.  i said six. they said the man in the gray flannel suit.  i think i said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
ah, mr. van orton.  here you go...
have we met?
show mr. van orton to his room.
the key?
hm?
is there a room key?
did not i give you two?
no, you didn't...
what the fuck... ?!
why are you following me?
i do not know what you are talking about.  I am just driving...
look... what I am doing is none of your business...
is alan baer "the game?"  is that what this is?
friend... why do not you back off.
hey... !
nice touch.  does the game use real bullets... ?
what is happened...
follow me.
nicholas...
that you have involved conrad... is unforgivable.  i am now your enemy.
are you finished?
no.  this is my lawyer, samuel sutherland.  i thought you two should meet.
we met, this morning.  i signed the termination contract for baer/grace. i accepted your settlement, nicholas. you were right.  I am going sailing.
how concerned should i be?
it was a misunderstanding.
someone is playing hardball.  it is complicated.  can i ask a favor?
you know you can.
find out about a company called c.r.s.  consumer recreation services.
sounds like they make tennis rackets. what do we know?
just what i told you.
nothing else?
christ... i can not believe it... invisible ink?
you are joking.
it is what they do.  it is like... being toyed with by a bunch of...  depraved children.
very well.  if you tell me not to worry, i shan't.
sam...  thank you.
mr. van orton... ?
ilsa... you are alright?
yes. what do you mean?  what is wrong?
did the alarm go off?  the house... they... you did not see... ?
i do not know what you are talking about.  what is happened?
there is been a break in.  lock this door and stay here.  do not move a muscle.
tell me where we are going.
just drive, man.  it is fucking nuts!
what is this all about, connie?
shhhhhhh.  wait... wait...
what are you doing?
they are methodical.  they are nothing if they are not that.
who?
c.r.s.  who do you think?  jesus h., thank your lucky charms.  to think what i almost got you into.
yeah, almost...
you dodged a bullet.
how do you mean, exactly?
they fuck you and they fuck you and they fuck you.  and then, just when you think it is done, that is when the real fucking begins.
slow down, take a breath...
it does not stop, nick.  i paid the bill, i gave 'em their money, but it all started again.  they will not leave me alone...
what have they been doing to you?
everything.  I am a goddamn human-pinata...
calm down.  why would they keep playing after you paid?
you think i know?  i paid them more to make it stop.
it is them.  they did this.
it is a flat tire.  that is all.
how do you know?
we are going to figure this out.  get a grip on yourself.
okay... okay.
the phone's dead.
really?
do you know how to change a tire?
no.  do you?  can not be too hard, can it?  i do not think we should be here out in the open like this.
how did those... ?
you are part of it...
what?  connie...
no!  you are one of them.  of course, it makes perfect sense!
no, it doesn't!  those keys were put there.  i did not even know...
you are behind this, are not you?  you and your sick friends.  well, make it stop!
listen to yourself.   why would i do anything like what you are describing?
because you hate me.  because you had to be here, when mom died.  because you had to do it alone.  well, do not you think if I would known... i'd've been here too.  I would have been here...
stop this.  it is not true...
I am sorry, christ, I am sorry!  how many more times do i have to say I am sorry before you forgive me... ?
stop it!
i need the police.
let's get you dried off first.  i might have some clothes below.
you know, these fit... perfectly.
they were my husband's.  my late husband... may he rest in peace.
I have been so lonely.
i can not tell you how not interested i am.
do not be nervous.  they said you would be nervous.
do not take another step.
is not this what you like?  they told me you had a thing for boats.
first they try to kill me, now you?  put your damn clothes back on.
he has not called back.
what about the house?
illegal surveillance, reckless endangerment...
attempted murder.
what makes you ask?
I am not sure.
all the time I have known you, you have never once asked about him.
he came to my mind recently, that is all.
your mother thought he was a good man.  he worked very hard.  what i remember most was his manner was so... slight.  it was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he would been there the whole time.
was he morose, or...?  i mean...
no.  what happened... no one expected it.
sometimes i wonder how much of him there is in me.
not much, i think.
I am just like him.
you are not like him at all.  i do not know exactly what is going on around here lately, but do not make me start worrying about you.
did you worry about him?
nobody worried about your father.
what are you doing here?
can we talk?
it is okay, dad.
did not think I would ever see you again.
come here...
what is it?
is this you?
where did you get this?
it was left in my hotel room, well, not really mine.  you are saying it is not you?
i think i would remember.  what makes you think it is me?
well... the red bra.
okay.
i thought...
do you mind if i sit?
sure.  you alright?  is this still that contest you are in...
I am tired.  I am sorry, i should go. I have been enough of a nuisance.
let me go get some clothes on. we will talk, okay?  be right back.
want anything to drink?
you?
yeah.  first communion.  are not i a little angel?
take the picture out.
what is wrong?
take the picture out of the frame and show it to me.
i don't...
they are watching.
wha... ?
not here!  they can see.
no!  I am sick of this...
nicholas...
what is this!?
god, wake up, it is a con!
what are you doing... ?
get out.
i could have handed you to them.  they find me now, I am dead...
get out of my car!
you do not have a choice.  no one else is going to tell you what is going on.
you can talk while i drive us to the police.
no cops.  I have got a warrant out. mail fraud.  they will take me in, but you will not be able to prove anything else.
who are "they?"
i do not know, nobody does.  I am an employee.
then, what good are you?
i know things... like who you can trust.  like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
that is a lie...
yeah?  i was your waitress on your birthday.  connie told you about c.r.s. that day, remember?  i was already playing my part, before you started the game.
it was not his fault.  he thought it was his only way back.  they fleeced him real good.
how?  how could they have gotten anything?
they did the same to him as they did to you.
what are you talking about... ?
why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
overseas operator?  please dial allgemeine bank, zurich.
they do not care about you anymore. alive or dead is the same, as long as they bury you deep enough.
what did you say?
i did not say anything.
my name's not christine.  it is not my real...
who the fuck cares?
it is just money.  you should be glad you are alive.
it might be best if we did not talk.
all i mean is... someone like you...
how many times have you done this? I am interested.
what?
scams, con games.  how many?
i do not know.  a lot.
whatever kind of nickel-and-dime shit you did before, this is more than just me.  your friends raided pension plans, and payrolls... they took just over six-hundred million.  you ruined people's lives.
who is it?
what do we do?
who is it?
what do you mean?  i checked them myself.  i made the calls...
mm... i would not worry about it.
what... what do you mean?
it is out of your hands.
no money, no identification or passport.  you are in a fix.  what did happen to you?
well, where to begin.  it is complicated...
it always is.
what happened was, I am on vacation, alone... i was robbed, at gunpoint. they hit me and ran.  two men, a few blocks away.  they took my wallet, money... all of it.  so...
robbed?
yes.
have you gone to the police?
i do not speak spanish.  all i need is to get back... just enough for that.
we will help with the police, if you want to bother.  as far as money goes... can i make a suggestion?  you say you were mugged?
yes.
and, they did not take that watch?
how much is it?  a few thousand, at least.  a rolex like that... lucky for you they missed it.
yes, very lucky.
what is the trouble?
you are here for conrad van orton? I am the hotel manager...
pleasure to meet you, I would like to see my brother, thank you.
your brother.  will you come with me?
what is this about?
it is a private matter, for you... i think you will be more comfortable...
where is my brother?
there were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  we did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
his behavior... ?
he couldn't, or refused to pay.  we extended credit...
look, where is he?!
there was an incident a few days ago... a nervous breakdown, they said.  the police took him.  they left this address, in case anyone...
i need your car, elizabeth.
what happened to you, nick?  i mean, look at yourself...
i know, look at me, well...  what happened?  i do not know.  i do not even really know.  i have some things to try to take care of... i need the car a little while.
of course you can have it if you need it.  can i get you something to eat?
the last few days, um... I have been thinking... had a lot of spare time.  i want to tell you... I am starting to understand why you left me.  I have been resenting you for it, maybe, but ... i want to apologize, for all of it.  for shutting you out, for not being there.  i...  anyway, i hope you can forgive me.
there is nothing to forgive.
it would mean a lot to me... if you and i could be friends.  if i could have you back in my life... in some small way.  it would be important.
of course, nick...
it is just a t.v.  he is just an actor.
yes.
I will explain someday.
i hope.
get rid of them.
hey, everyone -- snack time!  here... here you go...
look, it was just a job.  nothing personal, ya know?  i play my part, improvise a little.  that is what I am good at.
I am tired of dealing with peons.  i need to get to whoever's in charge.
nobody knows, pal.  nobody gets the big picture...  jason, tommy, cut it out!
goddamnit, why do they do that?
how do i find them?  their offices are empty.
they own the whole building.  they just move from floor to floor.
they know you... you worked for them. you can get me in.
no, i can't.  I am sorry and all, but...
tell them the cops are after you... tell them you have got to talk to someone, I am threatening to blow the whistle.
what whistle?  there is no fucking whistle.  this is fucking dangerous.
drive in.
what are you going to do anyway?  you will not get your money back.
i do not want money.  I am pulling back the curtain.  I am here to meet the wizard.
you do not need me...
shut up.  cuff him to the rail.
where?
i told you, they hired me over the phone.  i never met anyone.
where did you pick up your checks?
it was a different floor then...
guess!
like, this way... sort of...
what are you doing here?
I am back from the dead.
nicholas, okay... you are not about to shoot anyone...
get us out of here...
nicholas...
get us out!
what do you think you are doing?
you tell me... i want to know who is behind this.  who did this to me... how, why... ?
how deluded can you be?  there is no why...
who is responsible?!
it was not you.  it was not personal...
you call them...
it could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
call them, tell them to get the boss up here.  tell them I will kill you...
they won't...
they will!  you tell them if they do not come now, i will shoot you!
where did you get that... ?
... what... ?
that gun.  that... that is not automatic.  the guard had an automatic...
what the fuck are you... ?
where did you get that gun?
it is mine...
we searched the house.
guess you missed it.
just... wait.  just wait!  okay... please, I am not kidding anymore...
he is got a gun.  everyone, he is got a real gun up here!  real situation!  ... damn it...
what are you doing?
nicholas, this is fake.  it is all part of the game...
fuck you.
listen very carefully, I am telling the truth... this is the game.  this was all the game.
bullshit.  they killed him. feingold, fisher, whoever... they shot him...
no, now wait... think about it.  what did you see... ?
i saw them kill him!
what did you really see?  this whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies.  please, you have got to believe me...  he is got a gun, with real bullets!
stop talking to them!
okay... okay...  i put it down.  now open that door. mister fisher's right on the other side of that door.  he is an actor...
stop talking...
nicholas...
shut up!
let me show you...
no!  you take another step, I will shoot!  they are trying to kill me...
you are wrong.  you are about to make the biggest mistake of your life. put that gun down.
think about it!  they followed you every step of the way.  there was always a safety net.  the taxi, there was a diver.  at my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
that is not true...
it is.  it is what you hired us for. nobody touched your money.  nobody stole anything.  they are waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it is a celebration...
no...
open that door, you will see.  your brother's there... conrad.  he is there.  it is your birthday party...
stop it!
please, nicholas, let me show you...
do not move, you bitch... !
i have to show you...
no!
goodnight.  see you home.
goodnight.  where was she?
you know... how did you manage the gun? i mean...
baby, they were all over the house with metal detectors.  they switched your gun with a look-alike, rigged barrel, loaded with blanks.  pop-gun.
we have to head out... just wanted to say goodbye.
you are going?  well, thanks again.  good to see you, rachel...  thanks for coming, mel.  I will get your car back.  right now it's, uh... at the zoo.  sorry.
happy birthday, nicholas.
I will call.  i really will.
i know.
bravo, young man.  you have to tell me what this was all about sometime.  i want you to know... when it looked there for awhile like you were going slowly insane... i was fully prepared to have you committed to the finest mental-health facility available.  i mean that sincerely, do not thank me.
you warm my heart.
what?
this... ?  oh, this is just... this is the bill.
really?
yeah.
