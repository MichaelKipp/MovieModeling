hey...
your father wants to see you and your brothers in the throne room.
okay, but jimmy, when the house is rockin', do not forget the knockin'!
i knew it. he is finally retiring.
I have been waiting on this day for ten thousand years.
nothing, dad. just re-arranging the furniture.
cassius, did not i tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
now everybody sit down.
hey, dad, I am almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. i really think it is a masterpiece.
okay, kid, we will listen to it later.
knock, knock.
yes, jimmy.
no, no, that is not what i said. he can keep his thumbs, but the fingers got to go.
oh, and do not forget, you are shoving a pineapple up hitler's ass at four o'clock.
this was a very difficult decision, because i have three wonderful sons. i mean, adrian, so smart, so ruthless. and cassius, so strong, so tough. and nicky, so... so...
do not worry about coming up with anything. it is cool.
such a sweet boy. but after much thought and careful consideration, I have decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.
i mean... tough break.
the important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. and i do not think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. you need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
you work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
and he is dead serious.
it is just such a slap in the face.
um, excuse me, we are having a private conversation here.
yeah, get out of here! beat it!
that is what i thought!
could you concentrate for five seconds?
i am concentrating. where can we rule?
what do you think about... earth?
we could create our own hell there.
you saying we go up there and kill everyone?
eventually, cassius. but first we corrupt as many as we can so that when we do destroy them...
...their damned souls will be ours.
it is our time, brother.
now that was an experience. "you are only coming through in waves." that line blows my mind every time.
definitely.
i do not care what kind of mood you are in at the start of that song. when it is over, that mood has been altered. wow. great shit. what is next?
well, i thought that after messing with your head, I would give you a little kick in the keester.
who is this, metal-lick-a?
metallica, dad. come on.
i was just playing with you.
I am sorry. after careful consideration, i regretfully have to decline.
c'mon, man, I am just asking for one superbowl ring.
in exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? you are too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, mr. marino.
you did it for namath.
yeah, but joe was coming here anyways. just go back to earth and enjoy your records and the hall of fame and the beautiful family and all that.
this is bullshit, man.  I am going to win the superbowl this year, with or without you!
now you are talking.
you are a good devil, dad.
and i also happen to be a jets fan.
I am lucky to get away with just the head boobs, right?
coulda been much worse.
that is what I am thinkin'...
this is bad, nicky.
how bad?
I am going to die, nicky. if the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I will start to deteriorate into nothing.
what is with all the whoo-whoo noises?
everything's fine, pop.
last time you said that the renaissance happened.
please, pop, just go back to your room.
can i take him with me and have sex with his head?
sure, pop. whatever you want.
nothing's getting through that. the fire is solid as a rock.
we gotta get this bad boy burning again. ideas?
to do that cassius and adrian have to come back through the other way.
so go get 'em, dad!
I am too weak. the process has already begun.
so go get 'em, jimmy!
I am just a demon, nicky. i do not got devil blood in me. I would last two minutes up there with your brothers.
you are not saying it is up to me?
I have never been to earth. I have never even slept over at some other dude's house!
you are the spawn of satan. you got it in you.
nicky, the worst thing that could happen on earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
are you telling me i have to go to earth and kill my brothers?
no. this can not be happening.
son, just do your best.
you were gone ten seconds. what happened?
i got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
that is a train, son. do not stand in front of them.
well, i guess I am going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
please, nicky, get back up there.  try to hurry.
my name's beefy. I am an old friend of your father's. he is asked me to help you out.
i just need to find my brothers and be on my way, beefy.
it is not going to be easy. your brothers can possess people. so they probably will not look like themselves. you have to be suspicious of everyone.
okay, "bro," this jig is up...  just get in the bottle. just slide right on in there.
it is not me, moron.
oh. sorry.
makin' friends already.
it is freezing up here, beefy.
you are on earth now, kid. going to have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. we will stop by k-mart. get you some warm clothes.
i also have this odd pain in my mid section. kind of a hollow feeling...
that pain is hunger.
so far, so good. now what?
put it in your mouth.
hey... popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
it sure is. now eat it up. you are going to need your energy.
i got energy up the ying-ying. let's get cracking!
hey.
that is a pretty brassiere.
thanks.
could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
you got it. could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
you got it.
from now on. I am just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
great. now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the upper east side. but i misplaced it.
hello, friend, my name is nicky. i understand you are seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the village voice. would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
uh, do not you want to know what the rent is?
yes. what is rent?
eight-hundred, split down the middle. tuesdays and thursdays i rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits.
off limits.
right. and as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we will split the cost 60/40. cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap should not have to pay as much as the other guy.  are not you boiling in that outfit?
no.
it is like eighty degrees in this hallway. you from the south?
yeah. the deep south.
why is that funny?
i do not know.
and sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.
you will be alright. go on. big day tomorrow. do not forget to do that sleep thing i told you about.
got ya.  is it okay if i do the sleep thing?
"let the sin begins" -- that was a good one.
well, we must get people sinning if we want to fill up our new hell. how are things going down at city hall?
i lowered the drinking age to ten.
brilliant. this is so much fun. i never want it to end.
why should it end? who is going to stop us?
this is intense! and it happens every day? sometimes twice? i gotta tip my hat to you people!
look, it is okay for me to shit the street. but you got to use a toilet.
okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
come on, there is like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
well, let's rock and roll.
bus?
beast.
all that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
i think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. now I am going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
'bout time...
there is our man.
mr. sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side.
what is with that guy?
gotta be one of his disciples or something.
yo, man, i think that devil guy just got ripped off.
should we wake him up?
yeah. you do it.
which way did he go?
that way.
did you check out the dragon mouth?
the dark prince is here.
hey...
see something you like, my man?
yes. i would like my flask back.
you callin' me a thief, my man?
no, I am just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
and if that is your so-called "flask," how would i have it unless i was, in fact, a thief?
i do not know?
okay, now you gone and done it. you done messed with my business bitch!
sir, i would prefer if you did not raise your voice. it is making my muscles tighten.
that was amazing. thanks so much. you did not have to do that.
that is okay. i get messed with all the time and when i saw him doing that to you i just lost it. i hate when people take advantage of tourists. it ruins it for the rest of us.
you think I am a tourist?
I am sorry. i just assumed. your accent maybe. where are you from?
the south.
really?
yeah. deep south.  she laughs along with him, not sure why.
why are you laughing?
i do not know, but i like it. say. your glasses are nice. they make your eyes look sparkly and big. it is fun to look at them.
my dad's an optometrist.
my dad's in hell, and he is falling apart.
I am sorry. it is really tough when your parents get older.
if i do not save him, i do not know what I am going to do.
well, I am sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
here, have a popeye's. this drumstick am not for beatin' it is for eatin'.
that is alright. i already ate lunch. i actually would not mind getting a gelati.
could i come with you to getting a gelati?
if you want to.
want to? a million angry octopus people could not hold me back!
"octopus people?"
uh, it is a deep south expression.
it is freezing my hands.
it is not that cold. here, let me wrap it.
this town is really going to hell lately.  so what part of the city do you live in?
i have an apartment. i do not remember exactly where. my dog knows, though.
you have a dog? what kind?
I am not sure. I would ask him, but he is uptown talking to his contacts.
I would love to have a dog. but i go to school full time. it would not be fair to the dog.
school?
parsons school of design. i knew growing up i was not much to look at, so i put my energy into making things that are pretty.
what is that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
my perfume?
valerie, it feels like there is a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. is that normal?
sometimes, sure.
good. i was concerned.
you know, i was the one who created hell.
i know, your wickedness.
i started slow, though. for years, i was just giving people hot foots. actually, you can give all the credit for hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration. she was an ugly one, too. one day, she asked me if i wanted super sex. i said I will take the soup.
you know what was in hell when i came down here, cassius?
it is stanley, sir.
nothing. no mountains. no castles. looked like a giant parking lot. it was not even called hell.
what was it called, sir.
boogerland!
that is nice, grandpa. why do not you just enjoy the fishing?
i can not enjoy anything. i go fishing. i catch nothing. i go to orgies, i catch everything...
so you are saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals do not have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
basically, yeah.
wow. maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
you know what is nice about you? you just seem happy being yourself. you do not try to act cool.
thanks much. you know what is nice about you, valerie?
what?
your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
what was that?
i... i do not know why i just said that. i meant to say that...
adrian!
you should not have come here.
please, get out of my mind!
adrian, you got to come back to hell. dad's sick.
he is sick?
yeah, he needs souls to live. when you guys left, you broke the gates. we gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
he should have thought of that before he denied me my birthright.
well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
how about this? i stay here enjoying my schnapps and you go back.
so i was driving to work today, and some bozo in a cadillac cut me off...
oh, that is terrible, reege...
so i followed him...
you followed him?
i followed him all the way downtown, and when he gets out of the car, i reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum bat.
you keep a bat under your seat?
recently, yes! so i run up behind this guy, and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel happy! did you ever see the untouchables?
yes, great movie...
i was deniro!
your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
what can i do about it?
you can not do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
nobody's as evil as my brothers. those dudes put the wick in wicked.
go get a soda out of the fridge.
but those are my roommate's sodas...
"but those are my roommate's sodas..." does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
you have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. you just have to release the evil within you.
release the evil?
I am just saying, there is wickedness in you... i can tell from your snores.
it looks like the work of a brother...
a black guy?
if it is cassius, yes.
look who is back from the dead.
six, six, six, pick up sticks.
what is nicky doing down there?
trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on earth.
did you just talk?
no.
what is ozzy trying to say there?
absolutely nothing. the blizzard always came straight with his messages. but wrap your minds around this one.
no wonder your uncle's so weird...
i gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
come on. one more time.
not again, fellas. it kind of hurts.
please. you got to.
all right...
i was in love one time but she said i was not financially reliable enough. and she needed that.
by she, do you mean he?
no.
a little strange. i can not stop thinking about this girl, valerie.
why? did she hurt you? do you miss her? need a shoulder to cry on?
easy, liberace.
oh, would you grow up.
we had the greatest afternoon of my life until adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
maybe you love her. but what do i know? I am baked out of my mind.
that is a big pass, elton john.
we are going to see ozzy play at the meadowlands, right now. wanna come, nicky?
no thanks. I am afraid i would not be able to give ozzy the focus he deserves.
whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. later on.
see ya, fellas.
hello.
you smell like coconuts.
it is "comptoir sud pacific." makes me feel like a hula girl. which is kinda what I am going for. wanna come in?
no thanks. I am looking for a girl named valerie who also smells like coconuts.
valerie doran? two floors up, one window over.
thanks, much. good luck with the genital tucking.
i do not need luck. I am good.
adrian?
andrew.
hey.
nicky? oh my god. stay right there.
what were you thinking coming here?
I am not sure, but it did not involve getting blinded with poison.
valerie?
are you dead?
no.
what are you doing?
i think I am floating.
why would you be floating?
i do not know. maybe it is because of your sweet voice.
am i supposed to not be freaked out right now? because i am.
you got the wrong window again, man.
oh. sorry, andrew. valerie?
look, just because you are floating does not mean I am going to forget about you giving me the finger.
that was not me. i was being possessed by my brother, adrian. he is the one who call you a gross pig.
what do you mean, "possessed?"
remember when i told you my dad was in hell?
yes...
well, that is because he is the devil. and he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of hell, causing my dad...
..."the devil?"...
...to decompose. and i love my dad very much. so i came to earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and i met you and... well, my dog tells me i just might be in love with you.
you gotta believe me. you gotta believe in the butterflies.
okay, i do. get back up here.
can we go fly over central park?
next time. tonight, i want to share the most beautiful thing i could possibly imagine.
we are going to jersey?
east rutherford.
i never thought I would ever see ozzy live until he was dead.  please tell me you like metal.
"mister crowley, what is inside of your head..."
i seem to be in trouble, beefy.
the shit has hit the fan, kid. take a look.
i did not murder anybody
look. you were really high. things happen.
i was with valerie, i swear. this is adrian's work. I have got to find him.
i think you are looking at him.
this is baloney!
he superimposed your head onto "scarface."
I am not nicky. I am not home! i do not live here!
dude, it is us. let us in.
good idea... kill me.
dude. seriously?
yes. I will meet you at grand central at noon. okay. do me. i command you.
that just hurt a lot.
I have always wanted to kill someone. can i do it?
dad, adrian's got the whole city after me. he is always a step ahead. what am i going to do?
what are you gonna do? look at me, nicky! i got no legs, i got no hips, i got one ear...
i got no ears! i can not hear!
now he is got no ears! you happy, nicky? your father's got no ears!
uh, I will do my best, dad. do you have any advice at all for me?
i can not hear you, nicky. i can not hear anything!
check one-two. check one-two.
put it back on my head. I am falling apart here.
he is got 'til midnight tonight, nicky.  you get your ass back up there. you save your father!
you sure you are down with this?
little nervous. wanna puke.
looking for the chief.
we know where to find nicky.
where is he? he is late.
he will be here. just keep your cool, kid.
ta-da. so what time is my brother expected back?
noon...
but what about the cash? can we keep it or what?
sure, why not?
schnapps...
peppermint... alright.
it is awfully hot down here. how do you manage to stay so cool?
weed lowers the body temperature.  i read that... in, uh... er, science magazine.
and give you a good buzz.
or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.
uh. no it won't?
oh, nicky, I have missed you. come on out and say hello...
urr... uggg... errr...
I am calling you out, brother...
hello, cassius.
all right. let me out.
you know, new hell really only needs one new satan.
you mother...
of course i can. drink or she dies.  unlike you, she will not come back from where she is going.
let her go.
i hear a train coming. drink.
do not do it.
i have to, valerie.
oh. my. god. i can not believe you are here. welcome. can i just tell you, i am so excited right now.
so excited.
the home of eternal damnation, house of hades, h.e. double toothpicks...
maybe try the opposite of that.
okay, can i just ask you something? what do you know about your mom?
my brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. which would explain my chronic halitosis.
a mountain goat? that is really sweet.
my mom was not a goat?
try an angel.
an angel?
unh-huh. which would make you half angel.
wow. what... what did she look like?
well, she was about six-three, only spoke portuguese and had really long grey hair.
how come you are not older?
angels do not get any older, son.
where did you meet my father?
it was a long time ago, at some heaven and hell mixer.
i remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
try four and a half. at first i totally did not like him.
hello... yes, he is here with me now... i do not know if he is hot, he is my son, you perv! I will call you back...  oh my god, i will call you back, goodbye.  that was my friend, michelle, she says "hi."
well tell her i said "hi" back.
I will call her later.
you know, we saw you save your girlfriend's life.
how did you see me?
we can see what is going on anywhere on earth. look.
all these good people have totally been led astray.
show him central park.
welcome to the party. it is so nice to see all of you here.
hey, that is dad's throne! how did adrian get that? is dad okay?
this do not look good.
can not beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this?
they castrated him. he can not shoot arrows, he can not piss smoke.
i can not screw.  i can not screw.
valerie's crying!
she is so nice.
she goes to parson's, right?
i would totally love to go there. but i hear it is really hard to get in.
i gotta help her. i gotta help dad. i gotta help everybody.
yeah, you do...
but how can i win? adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
stronger, yes. smarter, definitely. but you have something he does not have.
a speech impediment?
what is it?
I am not a hundred percent on that. god said when the time comes, you will know what to do.
well, nice meeting you, jenna, christa.  would it be okay if i called you mommy?
it would be so okay.
well, mommy, get me to the big apple cause I am going to rock that town like a hurricane.
you are already there...
his name is andrew. i know that guy.
of course you do, tommy tune.
oh my god, he just opened his mouth and swallowed that spit.
that turn you on there, rupaul?
keep it up and i just might make you my queen for a night or two.
you want a queen? got one right here.
little nicky.
adrian, I am asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
is this a joke?
no. it is the inner light. and with it we can defeat anything you have got.
now will you get in the flask?
absolutely not.
thank you, nicky. cause now I am going to bust adrian's head wide open.
i was going to let you out, eventually, cassius. i swear.
nicky!
that was cassius!
where did a sweet southern boy learn to fight like that?
from my dad's side of the family.
you gotta kill yourself.
I will just go to heaven.
do me.
i love you.
i love you.
you came through, nicky.
i came through for you, mom and the butterflies, dad.
you are back in hell now, kid. there is no butterflies here. if you want butterflies, you need to be on earth.
what about you and grandpa and everyone in hell?
nicky, i let my butterflies die once upon a time and it is never stopped hurting.  that is right, you heard me, holly. I am still in love with you.
listen, i got down low. your mom's got up high. you take care of the middle.
i will, dad. but in the words of motley crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
no!
do not do it!
