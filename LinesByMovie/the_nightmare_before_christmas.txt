the deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, sally... i thought I would find you here....
no!
yes.
for this.
yes.
did not i tell you?  I am always right, you know, my dear... are not i?
yes.
you are mine, you know.  i made you.
i know.
if you went away, what would become of me?
I am grown up now.  i have to leave some time.
of course you do, and i want you to... but there is no need to hurry it along, is there?
i can not help it.
that is twice this month you have slipped deadly night shade into my tea and run off.  people might get the wrong idea and think you are unhappy at home.
i do the best i can to make it comfortable for us here.
i know.
but i guess my best just is not good enough.
that is not true.  it is a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... I am indebted to you for everything... it is just...
just what?
just me, i suppose...  I am restless.  i can not help it.
coming...
good.  I am hungry.
what trail are you trying to throw me off now?
nothing.  w-w-what are you talking about?
taste it.
but why?  it is your lunch. there is not much there in the first place.
taste it.
no.
why not?
I am not hungry.  what is wrong?  i spent all morning on that soup.  i thought you liked worm's wart.
there is nothing more suspicious than worm's wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell.
but i have to go out. something is happening out there.
whatever it is, it is none of your concern.
then we will both starve...  an old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...
can not you make other creations?
i could.  of course i could. but no one would be like you...  I will never understand how you can be so cold-hearted, how you can treat me this way, discarding me like--
<i>                      this is a thing called a present. the whole thing starts with a box...</i>
<i>                      -- a box? --        is it steel? --                     are there locks? -- is it filled with a pox? --                          a pox! -- how delightful, a pox!</i>
<i>                      just a box with bright colored paper and the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
<i>                      -- a bow? --        but why? --                  how ugly! -- what is in it? --                what is in it?</i>
<i>                      that is the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
<i>                      -- it is a bat. --              will it bend? -- it is a rat. --              will it break? -- perhaps it is the head that i found in the lake.</i>
<i>                      listen now, you do not understand. that is not the point of christmasland.</i>
uh-huh.
he stayed a long time.
when he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
he is conducting experiments of his own.
experiments?
we are here!  you sent for us!
specifically.
by name.
lock.
shock.
barrel.
<i>                                   ... let's draw straws.</i>
<i>                      jack said we should work together.</i>
<i>                      three of a kind...</i>
<i>                                     ... birds of a feather.</i>
<i>                      now and forever...</i>
<i>                      i say that we take a cannon aim it at his door and then knock three times and when he answers sandy claws will be no more.</i>
<i>                      you are so stupid, think now -- if we blow him up to smithereens, we may lose some pieces and then jack will beat us black and green.</i>
<i>                      i wish my cohorts were not so dumb.</i>
<i>                      I am not the dumb one...</i>
<i>                                          ... you are no fun.</i>
<i>                      shut up and listen...!</i>
<i>                      I have got something, listen now, this one is real good, you will see. we will send a present to his door upon there'll be a note to read.</i>
<i>                      now in the box, we will wait and hide until his curiosity entices him to look inside...</i>
we followed your instructions.
we went through the door...
not at all!
we can handle it.
he sure is big, jack...
and heavy...
where are we taking him?
where?
you would better be quiet, sandy.
maybe he does not know...
he has to know...
everybody knows about--
