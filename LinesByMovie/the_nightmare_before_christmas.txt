the deadly nightshade you slipped me wore off, sally... i thought i'd find you here....
no!
yes.
for this.
yes.
didn't i tell you?  i'm always right, you know, my dear... aren't i?
yes.
you're mine, you know.  i made you.
i know.
if you went away, what would become of me?
i'm grown up now.  i have to leave some time.
of course you do, and i want you to... but there's no need to hurry it along, is there?
i can't help it.
that's twice this month you've slipped deadly night shade into my tea and run off.  people might get the wrong idea and think you're unhappy at home.
i do the best i can to make it comfortable for us here.
i know.
but i guess my best just isn't good enough.
that's not true.  it's a beautiful home, wonderfully comfortable... i'm indebted to you for everything... it's just...
just what?
just me, i suppose...  i'm restless.  i can't help it.
coming...
good.  i'm hungry.
what trail are you trying to throw me off now?
nothing.  w-w-what are you talking about?
taste it.
but why?  it's <u>your</u> lunch. there isn't much there in the first place.
taste it.
no.
why not?
i'm not hungry.  what's wrong?  i spent all morning on that soup.  i thought you liked worm's wart.
there's nothing more suspicious than worm's wart -- it distracts one from every other taste and smell.
but i have to go out. something's happening out there.
whatever it is, it's none of your concern.
then we'll both starve...  an old man like me, who hardly has strength as it is -- me, without whom... me, your own father...
can't you make other creations?
i could.  of course i could. but no one would be like you...  i'll never understand how you can be so cold-hearted, how you can treat me this way, discarding me like--
<i>                      this is a thing called a present. the whole thing starts with a box...</i>
<i>                      -- a box? --        is it steel? --                     are there locks? -- is it filled with a pox? --                          a pox! -- how delightful, a pox!</i>
<i>                      just a box with bright colored paper and the whole thing topped with a bow.</i>
<i>                      -- a bow? --        but why? --                  how ugly! -- what's in it? --                what's in it?</i>
<i>                      that's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
<i>                      -- it's a bat. --              will it bend? -- it's a rat. --              will it break? -- perhaps it's the head that i found in the lake.</i>
<i>                      listen now, you don't understand. that's not the point of christmasland.</i>
uh-huh.
he stayed a long time.
when he left, he took a lot of equipment with him.
he's conducting experiments of his own.
experiments?
we're here!  you sent for us!
specifically.
by name.
lock.
shock.
barrel.
<i>                                   ... let's draw straws.</i>
<i>                      jack said we should work together.</i>
<i>                      three of a kind...</i>
<i>                                     ... birds of a feather.</i>
<i>                      now and forever...</i>
<i>                      i say that we take a cannon aim it at his door and then knock three times and when he answers sandy claws will be no more.</i>
<i>                      you're so stupid, think now -- if we blow him up to smithereens, we may lose some pieces and then jack will beat us black and green.</i>
<i>                      i wish my cohorts weren't so dumb.</i>
<i>                      i'm not the dumb one...</i>
<i>                                          ... you're no fun.</i>
<i>                      shut up and listen...!</i>
<i>                      i've got something, listen now, this one is real good, you'll see. we'll send a present to his door upon there'll be a note to read.</i>
<i>                      now in the box, we'll wait and hide until his curiosity entices him to look inside...</i>
we followed your instructions.
we went through the door...
not at all!
we can handle it.
he sure is big, jack...
and heavy...
where're we taking him?
where?
you'd better be quiet, sandy.
maybe he doesn't know...
he <u>has</u> to know...
everybody knows about--
