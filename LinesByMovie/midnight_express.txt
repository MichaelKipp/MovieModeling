i think i've been poisoned.
and you ate two baclavas, right? i not to touch them, mine was awful.
look, i think i'm going to have to go to the john again.  you go on through, i'll catch up.
never was anybody like you...
you can't take anything seriously.
you're right.
billy, what's the matter?
my passport!
no!
susan - forget it. go get us a seat on the plane. now.
what is it? . . . billy?
for christ's sake, just get on the plane, okay!
no, i'm not afraid.
good. there's nothing to be afraid of. if you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for new york tomorrow... yes?
yes...?
good. now, where did you get the hashish?
a cabdriver. he picked me up in the pudding shoppe in the bazaar.
would you recognize him again?
yes.  i think so.
good.  would you go back to the pudding shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him?
you decided to fly at a bad time billy palestinian guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all.
stupid.
four planes in four days...but i guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from turkey you got...
but didn't have heroin.
well, you see billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. the turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade.
but just...
just what?
i just needed some extra money.  i was broke, the guy offered me the hash and...
...are you with the consulate?
something like that. cigarette?
how much you pay this joker... this cab driver?
two hundred dollars. it was my last two hundred.
how much did you figure to make?
three, four thousand...i don't know.  the guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
beats working.
i was just going to sell it to friends.  i'm not a pusher, honest.
got a family back there?
yeah. parents, brother, sister. babylon, long island.
what's your father do?
he sells insurance for metropolitan life.
be tough on 'em.
girlfriend?
...she was on the plane.
she didn't know anything about...i wouldn't have wanted her to.
lucky girl.
jeez, she used to say i was the lucky one.
let's hope so, billy.  let's sure hope so.
how's it feel?
about as good as it looks.
getchmis olsun
getchmis...?
olsun - "may it pass quickly." i'm bell, jimmy bell. this is erich something swedish.
just erich.
i'm billy hayes... at least i used to be.
looks like a cheap hotel.
yeah... only the room service is lousy.  come on, let me show you the tennis courts.
feeling all right?
yeah.  that guy who beat me?  i feel stoned.
'figgers.
...he had a bald skull and...
hamidou.  chief of the guards. don't fuck with him. he almost killed an italian dude couple months ago.  bad news. he try anything with you?
the kids? why are they...
little fuckers are thieves, rapists, pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. don't trust any of 'em...
yeah.
history, man, history. how much?
two kilos.
where?
the airport. trying to get on the plane for the states.
could be ten or fifteen.  maybe even twenty.
twenty months?
twenty fucking years, man - years! i figger ten at the least.
years?
yeah, what do you think this is, the good usa? this is turkey, man... ) it's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. and anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
new people sometimes get on his nerves.
what did he do?
and you?
hashish.  ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish.
what they give you?
twelve years.
how much did you have?
a hundred grams.
it's not fair!
there is no fair in turkey, billy. it's all "sula-bula" like this, like that. an italian hippie had a car accident and a turk was killed. so, they threw him in here for six months...
that doesn't seem so bad.
but he was eating lunch a mile away when the turk smashed into killed himself.
he wasn't even in the car?
aslan, there...
you just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  and some money... talk to max.  he's been in the longest.
how long?
seven years...
lawyers?
yeah... there's no straight lawyers in turkey... they're all bent bent as hairpins...
his name?
who?
the lawyer?
what lawyer?
who got the frenchman out?
oh yesil...  yesil's his name but i...don't know anything... 'bout...yesil...
best way is get your ass out... any... way... you can...
what do you mean?
get the... midnight... express.
what's that?
dad...i'm...
...don't worry about it.  i can punch you in the nose later. right now we've got to get you out of here.  you all right?
yeah. how's mom?
bad. she couldn't make the trip. you know her boy...  susan told us before we got your letter. she's fine; she's trying to get the money to come back and see you, but...
no, don't let her!  i'll... how about peg? robbie?
same. none of the neighbors know. we told them you were in a hospital in europe.  oh... this is stanley davis. he's the american consul here... and necdit yesil, the lawyer you wanted...
hello, billy.
hello.
i want you to know we're going to do everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. believe me.
thank you.
vilyum, i am necdit yesil.
mr. yesil.
i know exactly what you feel but you must not worry, we are acting immediately, we get the right court, the right judge,  i arrange everything - just right.  and i think we get you bail. if very bad, maybe twenty month sentence... but i think we get you bail...
you know i have lectured at the university of maryland in your country?  also university michigan very nice country. we both go back.
if i get bail, mister yesil, they say it's easy to cross the border into greece?
right!  that's what we're shooting for.  mister davis and have been in contact with the state department, but right now relations with the turks aren't too good, nixon's upset the hell out of them. our best bet's... right here.
dad...  i'll pay you back for all this, i promise.
don't worry about it.  right now money doesn't count. okay?
where'd you get that limp?
nothing. just twisted my ankle.
where you staying, dad?
the hilton.
how do you like it?  istanbul?
well, it's an interesting place...  tell you the truth, i think the food is lousy. the crap they sell in these little restaurants. i went out to eat in one of them last night, and i had to run to the damn toilet... you shoulda' seen the toilet.
why'd you do it, billy?
for the money... )
i know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, billy. stupid.
i know.
what'd the prosecutor say?
it's not important, just technical things. we make our case.  you were very good, you spoke well. the judge like you. it look good. don't worry.
did you ask for bail?
dad!
oh jesus!
what is it with you man, what the hell is it?
cat, ah!  ayip!
you're ayip!
look, you don't fuck with me, i don't fuck with you, right?
but you fuck with me. you fuck with me all the time. you make crummy tea.  you rip us off on the hash.
i make special tea for you, hiyes, okay?  we've to live like brothers. we have to be in here together.
oh shove it, ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing!
know what?
was..  ...seven years old. i was on street in suk.  buy.  sell.  no family to take care. i learn.
learn what?
dog eat dog, hi-yes. you fuck other man before he fuck you.  and you must fuck last.
that's a great philosophy.
you 'merican.  you don't know.
to what?
the prison, man. there was this german cat an architect in the hospital. he was helping the turks build some shit round the place. i laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.
too bad you didn't have a machine.
there's two ways out i figger - over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. the other way is under.
tunnel?
it's already built!  there's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead.  we're sitting right on top of it -- here.
gotta be here someplace.  thought i heard a couple of dead christians singing down there.
stop shitting me, man!
but how would you get into the shaft, jimmy?
i suppose you knock three times and ask for st. peter.
hey!  i'm getting this together man and i don't need no fucking gastro-head along on this trip!  we go through the wall.
we go through the wall?
--the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. all we do is use gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, it's a two night operation, maybe three.
and what do you do when you in the catacombs?
the catacoombs?  whaddya want, a door?  there's miles of em like a sewer system but they got to come up someplace in istanbul.
you gotta be fucking crazy!  you got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in section 13, that's what - not the 'catacombs.
section 13?
yeah,  for the criminally insane.  i was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. it's awful. namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...
where is it?
i don' t know. it's someplace down in there....  ..deep.. a big door...a wheel....
hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here?  it's not a map, max. it's our balls. you know what i mean...  ...i gotta get laid man, i don't know 'bout you guys, but if i don't get it on soon, i'm... i'm not gonna make it.
shit.
billy?
what's wrong?
sit down a moment, billy.  i'm afraid i have some bad news for you.
no... it looks like your going to have a new court.
what do you mean?
the prosecutor objected to your sentence for possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the high court in ankara reviewed it.
and?
we've been notified that they rejected the sentence...
what do you mean life for for what! for what!
billy!  please!

...his money - steal that, you steal his blood... could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched?  if we knew where he hid it.  anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  we couldn't hide it anywhere.
