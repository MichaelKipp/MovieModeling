what?
look at this -- people are getting married, they are getting married...
you said that.
we are falling behind.
you know who we are?
tell me.
we are the guys who clean up after the parade.
I am going to stick this right in your eye.
i was at this comedy club last week and this comedian says "if you are over thirty and your job requires you to wear a name tag, you screwed up your life." and I am laughing and then i realize i wear a nametag.
so do i. so what? I am doing all right.
your brother's here.
what is up?
where were you?
i was... having dinner with shari and her parents.
what do you mean all of a sudden? you have been going with her six months.
i know. i mean I am sitting there and her father's asking me about my "career prospects" and I am playing "risk," with her kid brother, leon and at dinner the dog's sniffing at my balls -- at least i hope it was the dog. 'cause her mother disappeared for a while.
what is going on over there?
everybody's making audition tapes for that real tv thing.
oh, that thing. yeah. did you hear about this?
yeah, what - they put some schmuck on tv all day long or something?
you know, that would be like a great thing.
what?
that! being that guy. being the guy they watch.
what are you drunk?
yeah, but let's stay on one subject. whoever that person is is going to be famous. they will be able to get whatever they want. they will ... trust me, this is my business.
what is?!
show business.
you are in show business?
yeah. i service video equipment.
that is like... those people stitching nikes in panama saying they are in the nba.
I am not stitching nikes in panama! ... bedwetter!
thumbsucker!
I am making a tape.
we are excited.
yeah...
i hear the dog really liked him.
oh, the whole family loved him. of course, they loved the last guy i went out with, and he strung me along for three years and dumped me.
really? you see, to me, you should not have any trouble with men. there should be, like, a line behind you.
um, yeah, i was gonna ...
what is the deal? did anybody make a decision -
ed, look, uh... you are not getting the job. they are going to transfer someone from another store to manage this store when i leave to manage the new store. I am sorry.
oh, christ. did you go to bat for me?
i batted!
you batted or you bunted?
hey. i went as far as i felt comfortable. i mean, you know, let's face it -- you come and go here as you please. you work when you feel like it -- you know, bruce springsteen's birthday is not a legal holiday.
well, then I am quitting.
ed, come on. what is that going to do? you are going to bring blockbuster to their knees. let me recommend a movie to you. it is called "get your shit together before it is too late."
who is in it?
what did you study?
oh, see, studying would have been a huge help. where were you, then?
he is who we want to go with.
this guy.
i polled my staff. the men say they would hang around with him and the women say he is fuckable. and one of the men said he is fuckable.
I am not sure about the entire concept.
i got your message. way to go!
hi, shari.  let's go in the stockroom.
i ... I am not going to do it.
what?
look -- there is a million ways to humiliate yourself - i got to think of a new way? i mean, it is all day! every minute. id be like a monkey at the zoo. i just...
oh man! they could not pick me! they had to pick you!
you would do this? you would actually --
in a second! in a hot second. let me ask you something --
why do you do that?
what?
whenever you ask me something why do you always say "let me ask you something?" why do not you just ask me?
all right. let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
I am doing all right.
oh yeah? what is your master plan here?
you are going to be a video store clerk for the rest of your life? this is your big ambition, rearranging the "ernest" movies?
screw off.
how many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
i do not know.
that is right. you do not know. doors do not fly open for guys like us.
hey. you know-- we are not the same. i got a good life, this job suits me. i come and go when i please --
oh, do not bullshit a bullshitter. if you are happy like this you are an idiot, and you are not an idiot.  hi.
all right.
yeah?!
yeah.
no. the bathroom is off limits -and when i go to sleep they go to other programming. unless i get up. then they go back on the air. unless i get up to go to the bathroom, i guess, then -
what if--you're vomiting?
what if I am vomiting?
do they show it?
i guess -- i do not -- it is all in the contract. there is this million-page contract --
look, can we all just sign the releases so we can get on with this?
what happened? you described this "crazy-kooky" family who would be a million laughs on tv?
no! i barely even mentioned -it's just that, my friends, the people at work, whoever I am regularly in contact with they want releases from.
they are going to mock our foibles.
our what?
our foibles, our foibles!
we do not have foibles.
everyone has foibles. then the whole country sees them on tv and mocks them. then we have... mocked foibles.
look, my life is not so great, that i want it shown on television. and neither is yours.
that is the point -- this could change things.
how?
for instance... me and my friend bucky are buying out my boss. his equipment, trucks, client list, the whole shmear.
what does that have to do with... ?
if they keep ed on for one full month, he gets a balloon payment.
i'11 have to pass, al. and it is not an age thing --
no! do they show you having sex?
no. kissing and hugging, okay, but if it is actual sex they have to cut away.
at what point?
at the point -- i do not -- look you would be on tv maybe one or two times each. i'11 try to avoid i'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. believe me.
are you sure about this?
hey, believe me -1 know I have got a great chance of making a fool of myself, here.
why do it?
i saw this show once. it was about logging. i was home sick, there was nothing else on. do you know how they break up really bad log jams? you know, when they are really tangled... ?
cream rinse?
dynamite.
so?
so maybe this is my dynamite.
dynamite is dangerous.
ed, can i see you a second.
excuse me.
okay, so you understand? we are installing a permanent camera in your bedroom, one in the kitchen, one in the living room, plus, of course, there'll always be a couple of steady-cams following you.
cool.
i want you to take this.
that has my work number, my home number, my pager number. i sleep three hours a night. call me whenever you want to talk. off the air, on the air, whenever. okay?
um, yeah -- thanks.
now look. do not freeze up on me. i picked you because you had kind of a relaxed, go-with-the-flow quality. you are not going to lose that, are you?
no, uh...
i bet my career on you. you would better be good.
do not say that. that is like... telling a guy before you have sex you would better be good. you do not do that.
i do.
hey, lou.
welcome to work, ed.
polish acrobat.
hey. check this out.  look at this.
okay, i just wanted to get your attention. my name is ray and my friend bucky and i design video systems. you have got an office or a big home, we'11 come out there design you an entire system.
see, they should have picked him. look how comfortable he is out there.
hey, ed. did you hear about marcia?
no. what happened?
that is our sister.  she is got a new boyfriend.
ray, maybe this is not ...
no, this is great.  you will love this.  he is a singer.
marcia's living with a singer?
yeah. you know, piano bars. plays the piano and sings. that is how they met.
i mean my question is what was she doing in a bar in the first place?
ray --
she is an alcoholic, for christ's sake.
oh, jesus.
remember the last guy she got involved with? what was his name?
what is the dif --
richie!  she spent six months dating a criminal
she did not know he was a criminal. they had a relationship. they --
"quick pull off the highway" is not a relationship. oh man, i gotta pee.
what are you, hiding from the police?  show your face, you look great.  does not she look great.
great.
while I am gone, tell them about our cousin lenny who is gay. we knew from when he was five.
you do though, you look great.
right.
no, no, i -- as soon as you came in tonight i said to john, "boy shari looks beautiful." i said it on tv so you can ask anybody who saw it.
did you see that?
what?
her. that look. she likes the ed guy better than she likes the brother.
you are nuts.
okay, I am nuts.
are you asking me?
no, i mean...
what does this mean?
it means they hate his freaking guts. it means if he were on fire they would not put him out.
he is just ... trying a little too hard --
how much less?
never would be plenty.
i can not do that to him. he is pushing a little too hard - but... i just can not do that to him.
who is it?
it is me, ed.
hi.
you watching the ballgame?
uh, no, uh I am a little tired. i fell asleep.
oh. all right. i'11 watch at home, then.
yeah...
ray, where do you keep the glasses?
oh, is shari here? why did not you just say so? why are you giving me a song-and-dance about being tired?
hi, shari.
who is shari?
who is --
hello... shari, hi... oh no! ... oh god!
we would better go...
what is this? what is going on, who is that?
it is the receptionist at one of the places i service video equipment -- she is very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today i come in and she is all "i saw you on tv the other night... you were so great ... " next thing i know we are ...
next thing you know! why did not you stop?
stop? I am a guy. i do not stop. the woman's supposed to stop. we are the gas, they are the brakes.
i do not even know her. all i know is she likes snapple.
no, not her. shari. go over there and talk to her
why me?
you brought the cameras here!
you brought the girl!
please!
if i go over to shari, the camera's going there, too.
right, yeah --
she really does not want you and the camera in here right now.
no, i understand. that is - where is she, is she all right?
what do you want?!
shari, I am just really sorry. look, i know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if i could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then...
hi, mom.
shari, ray feels --
do not defend that horse's ass to me.
I am not. I am not. I am just look -- you know, in a way, it is good. he got this out of his system now and he knows it is not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something --
ha!
okay ...
I have got news for you-- i never intended to marry him.
oh... how come?
i mean bad.
look, not having been there... i just think you are hurt and you are saying this to, you know, get back at him.
really?
yeah.
oh my god.
it's... okay
i kissed my boyfriend's brother on television!
well, when you put it that way.
leave. go.
can not we just --
go!
all right. okay. i'11 ... see you.
really?
yeah. i mean for months I have been seeing you with ray you being his girlfriend and i kept wishing you were my girlfriend... but, you know, what could i do?
me too. i mean I am going out with ray and i'm... thinking about you.
really?
oh god, this is so weird.
weird? if this happened last month it would have been weird. now with... the tv and... now it is just too weird.
yeah. i brought you some movies.
anything good?
no, i intentionally picked out a lot of crap 'cause i do not like you.
is mom here? i gotta talk to her.
she is in the kitchen. I would yell for her, but I would die.  you had a busy night last night.
yeah. ma...
eddie? ...
yeah?
are the tv people with you?
yeah. the camera guy is here.
send him away.
send him? ma, i can't. it is -- just come out here. please, i --
no.
do you want us to come in the kitchen?
no. it is a mess.
look, ma, come on out. really. i need to talk to you.
ma, do you know where ray is? I have been calling him and I am getting his machine and --
eddie, how could you do it? your brother's girlfriend.
hey, he cheated on her.
he made a mistake.
i do not want to -- do you know where he is?
no. maybe he is watching.  tell him you are sorry. tell him you'11 stay away from that girl.
no! and that girl has a name.
what do you love her or something?
come on...
look at your face. i had a car that color.
i know you. this shari is a passing fancy.
no! i -- all right, look, if you hear from ray.... tell him to call me, okay?
how is marcia? she all right?
i do not know. she is living with that "entertainer"...
well, who knows? maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
mm.
you and al lived together a few months before you got married -- after dad left.
oh my god!
i mean, that worked out.
oh my god!!
i'11 tell you something else. the old guy in the wheelchair? the stepfather? they are going to have him die.
what do you mean "they're going to have him die?"
you know, for a tearjerker. the audience falls in love with this loveable old geezer in a wheelchair and then he dies, it is ... they know what they are doing.
this is real, bananahead!
so?
so if it is a show and they have a guy die that is writing, but if it is real and they have a guy die that is murder.
... ray?
yeah.
oh, man, I have been trying to call you.
i know.
look, we gotta talk.
save it.
what are we gonna fight? ray, please, listen to me --
cassie...
good-bye, brother!
ray, come an--
yes, ed.
could we just talk alone for a second? i --
good idea.  could you all leave us alone for a few minutes?
how you doing, ed?
i feel like when i was a kid and my mother sent me to school in orange corduroy pants.
uh-huh?
and all the kids stared calling me "pumpkin ass." "hey pumpkin ass," -- for like a year. so, now, i feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I am "pumpkin ass" again.
yeah?
can i give you one bit of advice? about shari?
sure.
a woman wants to be pursued.
sign here, please.
that ray was a pig. ed is doll. you latch on to him honey.
by the x.
some more make-up would not do you any harm. on tv you look a little washed out.
what would i actually have to do to get you to sign this?
oh, an tv a minute and already an attitude.
by the x. that is were two lines cross -- forming an x.
what are you doing?
i missed you.
you know, i never saw you in your uniform before.
yeah, well...
it is really a tremendous turnoff.
you should see the one we wear when it rains.
sunday night at the devils game, I am driving the zamboni.
the what?
you know, the big machine that cleans the ice.
oh yeah.
it is quite an honor. will you come with me?
they tore her dress! ...
we are going to get you a bodyguard, do not worry. ed, i have some news for you. we are picking up ed tv for another month!
yeah?!
that means a balloon payment and a big raise for the second month.
stand back -- I am about to do my happy dance.
mr. pekurny. I am sorry to bother you. my son would just love to have your autograph.
no problema.  you want a picture?
oh -- sunday is good for me to meet your folks. we get a big family audience on sundays so it works out.
that is lucky.
saturday, i think we should
what are you doing?
hm? i'm, uh... why is not this drunken woman you?
oh! oh -- okay, now i get it. it is "star search." you wanted me here because the camera comes with me.
ed, he needs a break. you do not know what kind of bad luck he is had --
i can imagine. you said you wanted nothing to do with this. you swore to me. "don't come near me. do not bring this into my life..."
i wish my stepfather was here.
why?
he could give me some oxygen.
um...
what?
i told you. if we... you know do it, they go away until ... we are done.
i know, but even if they go away, everybody in america knows what we are doing because... they went away.
so? what do they think -- we are not kids --
i know, i ...
shari, i really like you...
i really like you too...
...if this ...  ... were not here... ?
... yeah, then, but...
so...?
ed... i think we should stop seeing each other.
that girl's an idiot.
what?... why?
i have no privacy. even now! I am crying and i can not stop and they will not go away. and now it is going to be another month!
shari...
everybody hates me!
no. who?
look at this.
page three of the post.
ohh...
a poll. "is shari good enough for ed?" seventy-one per cent said "no."  they hate me!
who cares? i do not ca -- no. i do care.  shame on everybody. shame on you! well, just the seventy-one percent. the other...
twenty-nine.
exactly. boy, you are smart.  why are you so mean to her? what did she do to you?  "is she good enough for ed?" who the hell am i?  who the hell do you think i should be dating?
there is a list.
really?
ed?
hey, if it is free, it is me.  you ready?
yeah. you did good. what is wrong?
aah, i wanted shari to come.
oh -- so I am just, what -- a poor substitute?
yeah.  honey, if you are watching this is for you.
no! do not --  oh, wow.
what?
hi.
hi.
I am jill. i really like your show. i think you are great.
thanks... that is ...
oh, yeah, i love those. yeah... those are funny...
well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh...  I would better get a cab.
um... they gave me a limo, uh...
oh, great! thanks. I am just going uptown.
you think she really likes him?
she does not give a shit about him.
you know what would be great?
what?
if ray would steal this girl from ed. that would be great.
hello.
hi.
you do not recognize me.
no. am i supposed to?
i can not believe you are taking his side.
I am not! I am just trying to get some facts.
i told you the facts! he abandoned us -- those are the facts.
so everything he told me yesterday was a lie. everything.
yes.
yes to me or yes to the coil?
both.
holy sh--
he had girlfriends!
he says --
i do not care what he says. look, i do not need to relive this. on television!
whatever happened to norman rockwell?
who?
norman rockwell. he painted magazine covers. folksy. a mailman, a boy scout, a kid visiting a doctor...
yeah, so... ?
they celebrated the common person.
well, i do not think you can get more common than me, al.
no. only celebrities now. now, if you put a mailman on the cover of a magazine he would better have killed someone or no one will buy it. this one to dr. rumpley.
all right -- do you want to know the truth? i took you and marcia and ray to my sister's on the train for the weekend and you all got chicken pox. so i took you home a day early and there was your father with a woman in our bed. okay?
chicken pox? i was six. he did not leave 'til i was twelve.
he... apologized, he begged me. he can be very... charming when it suits his purpose.
but what was that whole story about him and a nurse?
she could have been a nurse.
could have been a nurse?
she had white shoes.
so does grandma. so does shaquille o'neal. you told me you had a hysterectomy and he ran off with your nurse.
what is the difference?
the difference is for twenty years i thought one thing and now it is another thing.
oh my god. you and al were - and that is why you threw him out.
he had a woman in my own bed! and how dare you call him "dad" in front of al.  this is your father. this is who was there for you when you needed someone.
jeanette, you are hurting me.
I am not -- i did not -- al, you know how i feel about you...
if i do not call you "dad" it' just because... 1 was already a big boy when you came into our lives --  or when i thought you came into our lives --
and what did he come back now for?
who?
hank! all of a sudden. because now you are famous and he can get something from you. i do not wan you to become a victim like marcia.  not that you are a victim, honey. you are not. life's just been a little hard on you, sweetie.
what do you think. i mean about... him. should i just... have nothing to do with him? i mean...
have i ever said a bad word to you about your father?
no.
well, now i will. he was a crazy mean, son-of-a-bitch.
i tried to tell you over the phone -- my parents went to atlantic city.
so?
so my little brother's staying here. I am sleeping with rita.
oh je -- could not he sleep with rita? we'11 all have a good time.
I am sorry.
come on, let's go.
where?
somewhere.
i feel like a criminal or, like we are cheating on someone.
just... just relax. okay? we will not do anything. we'11 just sit here for a while.
okay.
come on...
i need to talk.
are you all right?
she lied to me. i mean all my life, she is telling me one story and then... it turns out to be a completely different story. come to me at some point -- tell me the truth. no. not in my house. the truth is a stranger. and this is why ray and marcia are the way they are. marcia gets involved with all these losers and sees no problem with herself - "how do they find me" she says. ray cheats on you and then blames me for it. I am the only one in the family who takes any responsibility for himself... oh, man... are you all right?
yeah... i saw that girl come on to you at the tv show.
oh that was... no, i ... she just kind of trapped me into giving her a ride. it is you. i want you.
...yeah?
it is not their fault.
no. it is your fault.
what do you want me to do? you want me to quit the show?!
no... could you?
no. if i quit i do not get the balloon payment.
the what?
ray borrowed this whole tub of money against this balloon payment that i do not get if i qu -- it is too complicated. i -- besides...
what?
you see how people look at me. like when they ask for my autograph or say "hi" to me... it is like I am a basketball player or a... you know, like I am someone.
everybody's someone.
well, yeah, everybody's someone. but i mean someone they want to be. i mean let's face it, I am working in the video store, no one's coming in saying "oh, i wish i was that guy. 1 wish was rewinding that huge pile of tapes." at least for a month I am not just a guy with a name tag. I am famous.
this is going right up your ass.
come on.
no -- keep it.
i love you! 1 want to marry you!
hi. is shari here?
no.
what is she, at work?
she left.
well, when will she be back?
she won't.
what are you talking about?
she left. she moved. she got fed-ex to give her a transfer and she left. she could not stand it anymore. we had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. i mean it was she could not take it anymore. now I have got to move. i can not afford this place by myself.
I am sorry. where did they send her?
she would not tell me.
yeah.
you asked me if i had a dream. i said "sure, i have a dream. i just do not know what it is yet."
great line.
what if shari's the dream?
ed, do you want my advice?
yeah, that is why i called. i mean, maybe fed-ex would tell me where she moved --
leave her be.
you said a woman likes to be pursued.
pursued, not harassed. give it some space. can i tell you something -- as a friend? my sister was going with a guy they hit a little rough spot they started seeing other people they got back together and last month they had their third child for what it is worth.
oh!!
we have to stop meeting like this.
hm?
are you busy tomorrow night?
no.
why do not you come over. and i'11 make dinner. and you bring a movie. and ... we'11 make a night of it ... okay?
sure.
can i help with anything?
no. it is going to be about a half-hour.
what is? oh, dinner!
mm.
good?
mm.
ohhh...
ed?
ohh... do you own a cat?
yeah. why?
take him off the air.
what are you talking about? he is fine. he is out of the hospital already. the ratings are higher than ever.
I am telling you, it is peaked. ed tv is an over-inflated balloon. get it off before it explodes all over us.
with all due respect, cynthia you are nuts. I am giving him another month!
good luck.
who is it?
it is ed.
quite a shithole, is not it?
it could be, if you fixed it up. how did you... ? i mean how does anyone ... wind up like this?
i was in jail.
the whole time? eighteen years?
no. two times.
what...
check forging.
oh, man! so...
the last two years, I have been a limousine driver, but i do not see well anymore, so...
so you saw me on tv and you said "hey, let me jump on this."
i need help. how many times if just one little thing that i needed would have happened, it would have changed everything. if i had a few dollars when an opportunity came along or... the tumblers just never clicked for me.
all right... this is my father, i do not know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - i'11 ... help you. i'11 ... mention your business or ... i do not know, we'11 figure it out.  i got to go.
ed... I am sorry.
yeah? that is good. sorry is good. you know i finished that model.
what...
the pirate ship.
-- that we were doing "together." i finished it. it came out great! because no one was standing over my shoulder bothering me - "that's too much glue. you are using too much glue."
do you still have it?
no. ray sat on it. i'11 see you.
is not this getting kind of pathetic. i mean we drank the juice, now we are just licking peel. let it go!
cynthia, i think you are laboring under a misconception. you seem to believe that because you happened to predict this, we should be impressed. we are not. anybody in any business can predict failure. 1 need people who prevent failure. i want to see this thing turned back in the right direction. remember this was your baby.
yeah only i wish they had the sister on more.
ooh, the sister! she is hot.
you know it.
ed, everything goes off. "cheers" went off. "mash" went off --
yeah, but when they went off people were not making fun of them. they were not bozos! I am pumpkin ass again!
ed --
you know, everything you asked me to do i did. i call you for advice about shari you say -  "leave her be, see other people for a while." you just wanted me to get involved with jill because it made for a better show.
ed --
no. you screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. you never gave a shit about me.
yeah? well I am not starting now.
you know about that fireman who rescued that little girl?
when? today?
no! like, ten years ago. in texas. baby...  jessica!
oh right, right! she fell down, like a...
yeah, a thing. he became a big hero. he was on tv and there was a parade and a movie about him
right, right...
and then, uh... you know it blew over and he went back to being a fireman again.
right.
so he killed himself.
oh.
eddie...
mom?
I am at the hospital.
what is the matter?!
he is dead! eddie, he is dead! it was his heart.
oh god. what hospital?
st. joseph's.
I am coming right over. I will be right there.
mr. pekurny.
yes?
I am dr. geller. your mother is just lying down for a few minutes. we gave her something to calm her down.
thank you. can i see her?
just wait here. she is coming right back out.
mm...  oh, man...

what about him -- did he suffer any or was it quick? I would hate to think he...
very quick. between you and me, it is not a bad way to go. making love to your wife... it is very sweet.
really? they were..
according to your mother. when the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
hotel? what were they doing in a hotel?
i ... do not know. i ...
how is your mother?
al!
our neighbors gave me a ride.
al!!
where is she? is she all right?
i thought -- i thought he was dead.
who?
al!
no.  the deceased is ... henry pekurny.
you thought it was me?
yes!
it is your father. hank. your mother went to see him and he had a heart attack.
went --
what happened?
it was horrible. he called me up.
who?
hank! he said he wanted to talk to me to apologize for everything he begged -- he cried. so i went to this horrible hotel he was staying in... i felt so sorry for him --
so you had sex with him?
what?
the doctor said you were having sex.
to you? in front of him?  with the...
yes. he assumed hank was your husband. he did not know.
oh my god! on tv!
why? how...
one thing led to another. he was my husband once.
but al is your husband now!
do you think it is been easy for me? it is been years. al can not have sex.
apparently, neither can hank. what the hell did you do to him?
do not tell al. he does not know.
well, he is the only one in america who doesn't!
cliff left her, thanks to you.
me?!
that is right. you put cliff on television. so then he decided he was too good for her and he left.
i put his -- who --  look, marsh, he is not that good a singer, he will be back.
are things gonna be okay with you and mom? is there anything i can --
I am moving out.
what?!
I am going to be living with my brother. he is not in such good shape as i am, but... I am looking forward to the pillow fights.
oh, al ... this is just...
hank was always good with the ladies. always good-looking. hell, he is been dead for two days, he still looks better than me.
ed! how did you know i was here?
you are famous. somebody called me. what are you doing in a place like this?
why should not i be in a place like this? I am a whore!
ma...
I am a tramp  meet your new father. the whole nation is laughing at us!
and how is this helping? come on say, good-night to all your new friends and let's go home.
I am a whore!  your bathrooms are filthy!
come on, ma.
let's remember how i got into this. "please, eddie, do this for me. i can not get a break."
you know what your problem is?
yeah. my problem is I have got a brother who writes a sentence like "we grew up in a small, little bedroom." as opposed to a big, little bedroom?
i got paid by the word! no! your problem is you do not ever want anything to be your fault.
me?! that is you!
i commit. i take a chance. you wanted to be the guy on tv, but you did not want to say you wanted to. so you have me talk you into it so you get what you want, but if it goes bad it is not your fault.
i do not think so.
yeah. because, you did not talk me into anything. everything you wanted me to do, i wanted to do.
well, ed, that is ... not really possible.
all right, i'11 pay for the parking. big network!
i can't?
well, no. you agreed to stay on the air as long as we asked you to. the station entered into this on that understanding. if you had refused we would have begun this with somebody else. you can not just change the rules in the middle of the game, son. it is not fair to us. more importantly, it is not fair to the viewers. they are interested in you. they have devoted hours and days and weeks of their lives to you.
look, if you do not let me out of this... i'11 just... i'11 just sit in my apartment all day. i will not go anywhere, i will not do anything. what kind of show will that be?
not too good. that is why it states in your contract that if you do not continue to live a normal life, you are in violation and are liable for the station's financial losses. ed, i urge you to reconsider. i urge you on behalf of all those people out there whose lives have become so entwined with yours. play fair with them, ed.
all right. let them decide.
kinda'.
it is what i do. i yell "geronimo" and jump out of a relationship.
you were not able to make me feel safe or secure -- no easy job for any  man, i admit -- and my problem is, if i think I am losing, i pull myself out of the game. i bail. see? i told you, I am the love coroner.
what did you do to your hair?
my truck overheated, so i opened the hood and my hair got caught in the fan belt. so i had to get a haircut.
it is nice.
let's have a contest. now this would mostly be open to professional investigators and detectives. but anyone can join in.
what do we have to do?
my lovely assistant, shari. I am glad you asked. the contest is who can dig up -- legally, of course -- I am not suggesting that anyone break any laws -- the most embarrassing and humiliating facts about any of the executives here at the north american broadcasting system which owns real tv.
but facts! they have to be verified. anything from their past, their present, business, personal -- arrests, affairs ... and whoever comes up with the sleaziest, most degrading material -- i'11 give you ten thousand dollars. and you get to be on ed tv.  hah?
so act now. here's ed's home phone number.
where are you going?
I have got this great idea. we put together a video. "the network executives goofiest moments." and listen, I have really loved working here.
and each contestant gets one of these.  an "i tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
a hundred per cent cotton. okay, here we go, andy.
