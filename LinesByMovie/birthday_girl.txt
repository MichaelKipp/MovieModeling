is that everything?
yes.
right. okay. good.
it is about forty miles from here. i do not know if you have looked at a map, it is close to london but it is a city in itself. a roman city. it is a nice house. I am having a problem with ants. i uh... it is the warmer weather. i can not seem to find the nest. sorry, do you understand "ants"?
yes.
i just can not find a nest. the root of the problem. I have looked everywhere. what is the russian for ant? sorry that is a stupid... sorry. this is strange is not it.
yes.
I am pretty nervous. are you?
yes.
i mean... "ants." "i've got a problem with ants."
so. is it different to how you imagined it?
yes.
i bet.  what about me? am i how you imagined?
yes.
and how was the flight. sorry, am i speaking too fast for you?
yes.
do uh... sorry. can you follow me? do you understand what I am saying?
yes.
good. or should i speak slower?
yes.
do you follow or should i speak slower?
yes.
uh... are you a giraffe?
yes.
today is bath day.
sorry?
i do not understand.
happy bath day.
syevodnya?
syevodnya
happy birthday. happy birthday.
how is that? we can not drink our piss can we?
hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
you must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
what are you doing here?
sorry. you have lost me...
I am asking what you are here for.
what?
"frenzy".
yes i know.
what did he say?
he says he feels safe here.
i need to know who you are first please.
oh.  we are russian.
yes. i know.
good.
and...
and what? you mean from the beginning? jesus. can i uh okay, as we say in russia can i cut a long story short. okay. nadia is my little cousin. except she is not. but we say cousin. this is for you.
hold on.
toast first then we talk seriously, i can see you are serious about us.
so hang on. you are both nadia's cousins?
of course not. alexei, he is is my problem.
right.
we better watch him. he is crazy.
right.
i am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. i just noodle along, I am not so good. he makes me look like a retard -- he smokes me. i do not mean he smokes me.
no.
right. so i can say he smokes me. so.
so?
so i come to england with other actors to make shows, i meet this freak from novgorod i tell him of you and chicken and the birthday here we are.
what was that?
i asked her if you were happy to see us. i find it hard to tell with you.
yes it is okay. thank you for the food.
so how long will you be in england?
plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
you must have a visa or something...
you are asking for my documents?
no, no...
she says 'hello' to you. go for it john!
uh. do you like england?
classic!  thank god. she says 'yes!'
she says she has a secret to tell.
what?
when?
"i saw you waiting there, by the gate."
i...
"i have these uh..." she explains to you... "when i was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." like... i do not know the word. like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
binoculars.
binoculars. he had these binoculars he has kept from the war.
what was that?
oh nothing.
tell me.
no. it is too judgmental.
tell me what he said.
he says why did you send to russia for a wife.
you are not ashamed of it? it is no surprise to want to love.
no. it is not that.
do you believe in love?
i suppose it's... i mean define your terms.
it is very strange. how many people are truly themselves with their love? it is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. there are no marches against heartache, no ministries against loneliness, no concerts against disappointment. we look away. and still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. the one thing we all share but do not say. look john i will show you something.
this is sensitive. your car. lovely car. does not necessarily give the right impression.
ch...
to customers approaching the bank from the rear
right.
you can see why it is sensitive?
uh... yes.
how is bank?
fine. i thought you were leaving today.
to be indoors on such a day. it is crime.
they go. john. they go.
what is wrong?
they go.
of course. they go. yes. yes.
they go.
i understand. I am so sorry
you can stay tonight.
i have brought you trouble. maybe i should have come alone.
good night.
put the fucking kettle down.
john.
put the fucking kettle down. tell, yuri, tell him put it down or I am going to make him.
he says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. john, he is a soldier. a trained killer. we must do what he says.
what? what does he want?
what did he say? tell me!
he says you are very sad ridiculous man. i do not agree of course. and that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. nadia is a prostitute. I am sorry.
what does he want. the russian shithead. what do you want ?
he wants money.
tell him to put the kettle down and I will give him money.
he wants a lot of money.
I will give him money. tell him to put the...
he wants the money from your bank.
I will fuckin' give it to him! we will go down there.
you do not understand. he wants all the money that is in your bank.
I have got eight hundred pounds. oh jesus.
oh jesus.
he is sure you can do this. of course you can not.
oh jesus. of course i can't.
just leave her alone.
I am so sorry.
leave her alone.
hello.
i thought you could give us the tour this morning. sort of be our indian guide.
right.
you first.
fifty thousand. almost exactly.
sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
there is over eighty thousand here.
put it in the cases. split it up. and do not forget you owe me 150.
what for?
you know what for.
no i don't.
i got you those trousers from paul smith.
I have been buying you stuff all week. I have been buying him stuff all week.
such as?
when we went to the hard rock cafe. who paid? when we went to see 'cats'. who paid?
those are not presents. that is normal friendship stuff
i paid for those guitar cases.
yeah it was okay.
yeah. it was quite good actually. some bits i really liked.
the sets were good.
the sets were excellent. everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. it was really clever.
it is enough is not it?
what do you mean?
you know what i mean babe, it is enough. we can stop.
do you want to stop?
yes.
we will stop then.
what is this?
it is nothing. i burnt myself.
that is not a burn.
it is. i did it cooking.
do you like it?
yeah.
say thank you.
thank you.
what?
you heard what i said. I am pregnant. I have been throwing up for weeks.
a baby? what are we supposed to do with a baby?
name it.
oh, i do not know. in my job as deputy assistant of new business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. this took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. but, you see, I am not in that line of work anymore. nowadays I am a bank robber.
you do not understand anything.
i think that about covers it. i think i have grasped the part about you being dumped though. that is got to hurt, i imagine. that is got to smart a bit. i mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on pretty fucking famously.
unless. unless this is part of the routine. you get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and steal my cup of coffee.
it is makes it easier. okay.
i do not want to know.
it makes it faster. if i do not speak to the men, they fall faster. it is pretty obvious why.
that is a relief. it is nice to know I am a regular guy.
so what are you going to do?
I am going to drink my coffee. then, we are going to the police station. where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
they do not blame you. when a bank employee does this they understand. you get your life back. anyway i bet you hated that bank.
even so i always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
why else would you send off for me? if you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
well as it turns out i did.
you must think... I am the biggest pillock... in the world.
no i don't.
in the world.
i know you just want to punish me --
i do. i want to very badly.
so you are just going to be vindictive
in every sense. if at all possible.
you can not hurt me more than I am hurt already.
well, nadia, it it is all the same to you, I would like to give it a bash.
where is the restroom?
what?
I am going to be sick. where is the...
what? no you are not..
I am going... i am... I am going to be sick.
no you are not. how... nice one. how dumb do you think i am ?
you do not have to do this. i can look after myself.
have you got your passport?
what?
shut up. have you got your passport?
yes.
give me some money.
i do not have any money.
what?
i said i do not have any.
so, uh, alexei, which i know is not his name...
i do not want to talk about him.
fine.
it is none of your business.
fine. absolutely. must be disappointing though. must come as a hell of a shock.
so uh...
look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
oh jesus.
if what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
of course. of course. of course he does. of course. thank you. thanks.
but, you know, so what?
not the kids type then is he? not that broody. you must be pretty miffed.
he will come back.
excuse me?
he left me my passport and ticket. it is pretty clear he wants to see me again.
yeah. i tend to tie up and abandon women i really want to see again too.
no. but you tend to tie them up.
i do not want to talk about it.
why not?
shut up. I am not listening.
you do not want to talk about it.
no.
okay we will not talk about it.
we will pretend it never happened.
so. what is it like having to fuck men you hate?
i do not hate you.
okay. let's... okay. okay. you have had sex with people you do not like have not you? for money. to make money.
and? what are you saying?
and. it is wrong.
and who says what is wrong.
and that would be morals. that would be one's own moral sense of decency.
what is a moral orgasm john? tell me how it feels exactly.
so. what then? you just detach sex from everything..
whereas "wet 'n' wild" is an emotional journey. "tied and tethered". it is pretty moving huh? like anna karenina.
listen. i did not go rooting around in your private stuff.
so what? do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you are with him, or what?
sometimes.
sometimes which?
sometimes neither.
some... what does that mean?
there is nothing wrong in liking sex, john.
i do not like sex. i do not think I will be having sex ever again.
why?
well, it is just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
so now you hate all women?
i think it is my safest bet, do not you?
oh. i think you will recover okay. i think you got what you paid for.
what?
you...
i got what i paid for.
you did not mind too much.
it was not what i wanted.
so what did you want? i think we understand each other, no?
you do not understand me.
you do not understand you either.
excuse me?
get out
you are throwing me out.
get out.
you know, in russia, there is no work for women. it is a different world.
you do not have to say anything
what? i... i was not saying...
please, there is no... oh.
i was not saying anything.
then okay.  so how old were you when you met him?
fifteen. you do not know him. he was very kind and strong.
yeah. he is a smashing bloke.
the rest of the world, john, it is not all like st. albans.
thank christ for that.
you are pretty naive if you think it is.
I am pretty naive? look at you. you have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? nothing.
i do not have nothing.
well what have you got?
do you know if it is a boy or a girl?
no.
have you had any before?
no.
are you scared?
not really. maybe a little.
what happened between you and the blonde?
what?
the thin... the girl with small eyes. the one in your cupboard.
it is none of your business. she did not have small eyes.
did she leave you? come on. it is nothing to be ashamed of. who did she leave you for? your best friend? her boss? a woman? did she leave you for a woman, john?
she is dead.
I am sorry.
i do not know why i said that. she is not dead at all.
what?
i do not know why i said it. I am sorry.
she is alive?
she is alive!! she is not dead?
laugh it up.
you should stop smoking. you are pregnant. you smoke like a fucking lab dog.
I am trying to quit.
I have got news for you. it is not working.
i smoke more these days. i smoke more when I am unhappy.
nobody's that unhappy.
maybe i want to die. do not you want me to die?
i do not want anyone to die.
except for small eyes.
except for small eyes.
i do not know.
what was her name?
what is your name?
you know you can come under the blanket.
it is alright.
I have got an hour. can i buy you a coffee?
no. i think i better just go.
okay. thank you.
whatever.
yeah. no thanks.
please. why not?
because it was a lie.
what? what are you doing?
what are you doing here?
what. you are what? you are with this creep now.
leave him!
you have. you have actually fallen for this prick.
no i haven't.
okay. goodbye.
goodbye.
something else.
okay. promise?
you can probably buy them on the flight.
I am quitting. this will be my last one. so. goodbye.
goodbye.
you did not deserve me john buckingham.
whatever.
I am sorry.
please.
it is not mine.
it is not mine either.
it is what you came back for.
why?
I am not asking you to marry me.
no. what? no. i know.
it is more like a date.
it is a long way to go for a date.
tell me about it.
what does it mean?
maybe you will find out.
hurry. I will wait for you here.
right.
is the flight full?
I am sorry sir. i believe the flight is closed.
