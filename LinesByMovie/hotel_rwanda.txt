rutaganda's place?
what is wrong?
beg your pardon sir, you are hutu. you are safe there.
you are with me, zozo, do not worry.
what is it like to fly on a plane, sir?
it depends where you sit zozo. in coach it is like the bus to giterama.
that is why they call it coach?
maybe. but in business class there are fine wines, linens, belgian chocolates.
you have taken business class?
many times.
i will try my best george but these days i have no time for rallies or politics.
politics is power, paul. and money.
time is money, george. we need extra beer today.
business is good at the hotel?
very good.
i am always glad to see you paul.
a bargain buy, from china. ten cents each, I will get a dollar.
at least.
sit up, smile, zozo, do not attract attention to yourself.
boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know I am tutsi.
paul!
gregoire will deal with it, excuse me.
twelve are dead.
how dead?
paul, this scotch is exceptional.
it is a single malt, glenmorangie. i thought you would like it. anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
oh, paul, talk to the coat check, please.
paul, paul, a moment please.
yes, benedict, what can i do?
can you get me into the ambassador's reception?
I am sorry, it is a private function.
gregoire, there are no cockroaches in this hotel, do you understand?
cockroaches?
no, bik, it is a code word for tutsis.
that is what i came to talk to you about.
excuse me?
the hutu-tutsi thing. the bbc faxed to say they would be here on the sixth for the peace accords. and the u.n. wants the banquet room for that day, a reception to broadcast the signing ceremony. can you organize monitors and check the satellite dish?
leave it to me.
also, could you remember to use the service entrance at all times?
of course.
good evening, odette, who is sick this time?
i asked odette to take a look at little anais. she has a rash.
your brother's here?
yes, with fedens and the children.
thomas wants advice?
he wants your wisdom.
let's have dinner first.
of course.
for food and clothes, and all that grows, etc, etc. dear lord, thank you.
thank you, roger.
why the hurry, roger?
simon has a new pet. can i go see it?
no, i do not want you going on the street.
please, papa, i have a secret path.
who is this simon?
simon, next door, the charingas' boy.
homework?
there are soldiers.
where?
on the street.
do something.
what?
call your friends in the army. call someone. victor is harmless. this is a mistake.
please, be quiet.
no.
we must do something.
why did not you call your contacts in the army?
i could not help.
you could have asked for a favor.
no, i could not. what do you know about favors tatiana, about barter and deals?
victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
he was not family. family is all that matters. do you think if you or i were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?
they do not have your connections.
connections? i have no connections, only favors. if i call to help victor, a general will think "paul rusesabagina is a fool. he thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." then my hard work is doubly squandered. i insult the general and i do not get to use my favor at all. please leave these things to my good judgment.
paul, how the hell are ya'?
i am delighted to see you, mr. daglish.
they moved you from the diplomat?
promoted. house manager.
good for you.  we are having a little trouble, paul. we booked five rooms, but...
great, i really need a shower.
just give me a moment to get your keys.
there are no more rooms.
give me the phone.
the fifth room is your broadcast room.
good. I would like to book a massage.
of course.
did you bring any of those wee girls who used to sit at the bar in the diplomat with you? you know?
I am sorry, mr. daglish, this is the mille collines. no working girls here.
can we phone them in, paul?
I am afraid i can not do that, mr. daglish.
paul! paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. then he sees their friends odette and her husband jean baptiste.
jean baptiste!
the president has been murdered.
murdered! by whom?
where are thomas and fedens?
i sent them home. go and call them.
i tried already. the phones do not work.
is every tutsi in the neighborhood here?
they came through the bushes, over the wall. what could i do?
send them home. we are not the police. what do we have to protect them?
please. let them stay 'til morning. the militia will not come here, they know you are a hutu with influence.
they know you are tutsi!
please, paul, 'til first light.
dawn. then they go.
oh, my god!
where are you hurt, son?
what is it, paul.
stay with the children.
who are you?
i am paul rusesabagina, a good friend of general bizimungu.
we are looking for you.
what is this about?
let me see your identity card.
you heard the tutsi cockroaches murdered our president.
yes, it is a calamity for us all.
you work at the hotel diplomat?
no. i work at the mille collines.
i used to work at the diplomat.
do you know how to open the safe there?  our government needs to use the hotel and the room keys are in the safe. you must open it.
of course.
captain, i must take my family. it is not safe here.
where is your family?
they are all tutsi cockroaches.
let me explain.
please, i do not use guns.
there is nothing to it.
you want to pay me?
why not? these are not rebels, look at them. soon they will be worthless to you. why not take some money, for your work?
how much?
name a price.
ten thousand francs for each one.
i do not have that much.
here, here, a thousand us dollars - fifty thousand francs for my family. to let us drive off to the mille collines.
how many in your family?
six.
paul, do not let them die.
get in.
ten.
and four children?
I will give you a hundred thousand francs for all of them.
give me it.
i do not have it here. at the mille collines. i can get it for you.
you will run into the hotel and hide behind the u.n.
i swear, captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. i will get the money, you keep them outside.
paul...  ...i have to talk to you.
I will be back.
do not be foolish. there is more money to be made here.
you want to buy anymore cockroaches ask for captain naramunju.
them. they almost got us all killed. i have done enough for them! we cannot look after them anymore.
what are you going to do? you cannot drive them out onto the road. they can stay with me.
what!
i will not have them on my conscience. they will stay in my room.
zozo, get a key for two staff bedrooms. put these people in them.
moses, moses seradungu.
can i help you?
I am looking for moses seradungu's room.
what is his room number?
i do not know.
go downstairs, i will help you.
this will not do.
it will do just fine.
any luck?
no answer. please send someone to get them, please.
I will try.
terrible times, paul. there are bodies everywhere. i cannot stay here.
i need a great favor.
i need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
no, no. this is a very dangerous part of town. i cannot do this.
this would be an enormous favor to me. i am a man of means, mr. garandi. when this nonsense is over i will be most grateful.
i will see what i can do.
where are the receptionists? where is gregoire?
he has taken the presidential suite.
what! paul storms off.
mr. manager.
gregoire, what are you doing here?
get out of this room and get back to work.
i do not have to listen to you anymore.
i am in charge now. get back to work or I will fire you.
let me ask you mr. manager, do you notice a smell of cockroaches? if i were to leave this room, I am sure i could find this smell. i know people who could cleanse it. but maybe it does not bother you? why is that? are used to this smell? not me, i need a clean room to escape it.
paul, you know who this is?
yes, colonel monsieur xavier, the minister of finance.
get him a room, but tell no one he is here.  paul will look after you.
i will need a suite.
of course.
do we know who fired the missile that killed the president?
no. but i fear it is intention may have been to kill the peace accords and spark a civil war between the hutu militia and the tutsi rebels.
we have heard reports of reprisal killings. will the un intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
unfortunately we are here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can not take an aggressive role.
if the un changes your mandate could you stop the bloodshed?
yes. with some re-inforcements I am confident we could impose order.
have you requested re-enforcements?
yes we have.
what was the response?
we are awaiting a decision, excuse me.
paul, I have sent my soldiers to rescue the lady prime minister, she will need a room.
yes sir, but these people  they cannot stay here. I have heard you have a refugee center at the airport stadium?
I am sorry, i can not possibly take them paul. I am overrun with refugees. as soon as we can stabilize the situation we will take them.
for fuck's sake, gloria there is a big news story out there! we need to get out and cover it.
were not going outside the hotel grounds unless we have an armored car. that is the ground rules.
ground rules! where the fuck do you think you are, wimbledon?
we cover the story from here until we can get proper protection.
where is housekeeping? they will not pick up.
sir, no one wants to work. they say the boss has left.
can i have your name again?
paul rusesabagina, mr. godefroid. the house manager. i met you on your last visit.
yes, paul, i remember. the mille collines is a very important property for sabena. our directors believe we should close down, shutter the place until this unrest is over?
very well. but if this thing gets worse, we must close. if there is anything you need, call anytime.
there is one thing i need right away.
what happened?
they are killing everyone. the lady minister! the un soldiers. they are at the gate.
hold the line here. do not shoot! the colonel stabilizes the situation, his men watch the militia drive by. paul approaches oliver
what is happening?
they murdered my soldiers. ten belgians who i sent to get the lady minister.
where is she?
has roger spoken yet?
no, odette says he is in shock.
how can we help him.
he needs to be in a safe place.  have you heard from mr. garindi?
give him time.
perfect timing.
this goes out live?
satellite feed.
great.  no kidding, when will they be here? excellent. yes, call then.
the news room has heard that the french and the belgians are putting together an intervention force.
when will they be here?
very soon.
thank god.
holy shit! holy shit.
what is it?
you fucking see that!
oh my god!
here, have a sandwich.
fuck you.
was there blood?
no blood. as i left a neighbor, an old woman, waved to me. i went to her house. she has the little girls. they are safe.
this is not bad news, tatsi. perhaps they fled or could not make it home. there is hope.
please go back, bring the children to us.
my sister is dead, paul. they would not leave the children.
no. they are not dead. stop this.
anything. strong.
canadian club?
congratulations, colonel. you have saved us all.
congratulations. you should spit in my face.
excuse me, colonel.
we think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
i do not understand.
do not bullshit me, paul. you are the smartest man here. you have them all eating out of your hand. you would own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
you are fucking black! you are not even a nigger, you are african!  they are not staying to stop this thing. they are going to fly right out of here with their people.
their people?
they are only taking the whites.
they are being evacuated.
what about us?
we have been abandoned.
listen to me woman. i said all the whites are leaving. the french, the italians, even the belgian un soldiers.
but who is left?
i do not know. colonel oliver says the un has three hundred soldiers for the whole country. black soldiers, pakistanis.
give her what she wants, room, food, anything. charge it all. do not you put her out, paul.
i would never do that.
i know that, paul. I am sorry.
this is a rolex, i can not take it.
take it for christ sake. i wish it was a fucking aeroplane.
lets go, jock.
go! what the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I am ashamed. are you? well, are ya'?
youre drunk.
what do we do with all these people?
open up the ballroom, we will put them there. and zozo tell the kitchen to make rice and beans - a lot of it.
you could leave, paul.
what are you saying, tatsi?
your card says hutu. take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. get them out. please.
enough of this. we stay together. let me rest, i will feel better then.
you are the manager?
yes, sir. what is wrong?
everyone must leave the hotel now.
why sir?
it is an order. get everyone out now.
i...ah...need some time. please give us twenty, thirty minutes. people are sleeping.
go to the roof now.
what for paul.
do as i say. i will be there soon.
paul. are you alright?
we have a big problem. the hutu army have come and ordered us all of us out of the hotel.
out? where are you going?
i do not know, sir. i think they will kill us all.
all. what do you mean all?
the staff, the guests.
the staff and guests! how many?
now we have eight hundred guests and one hundred staff. i have ten minutes left.
paul, are you there?
yes, thank you mr. president.
paul, if you have one call in all the world to stop this, who would you call?
the french. they supply the rwandan army.
paul, do everything you can to buy time. i will call you back.
what are you doing?
the lieutenant wants the register.
anderson, arthurs, boulier. what is this?
the guest list. it has not been updated since the murder of the president.
are you trying to make a fool of me? there are no europeans left in that hotel. get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
that will take time.
you do not have time. if i do not have the names, so that i can pick out the traitors, then i will kill everyone here in this car park. get in there now.
who did you call?
call, sir?
do not lie to me. what is your name?
rusesabagina. paul rusesabagina.
i will remember that name.  let's go.
i managed to get the president of france on the phone.
thank you, sir, you saved our lives.
paul, i pleaded with the president to go in and get you all. he told me it will not happen.
why?
i can give you many political answers paul but the truth is that africa is not worth a single vote to all of them: french, british, americans.
I am afraid you will have to move room.
move? where to?
I am going to put you on the third floor.
the third floor are low class rooms.
yes they are. however if the army return they will expect important people such as yourself to be in these grand rooms.
pack the bags, we have to move.
also, this is your bill for the last week.
I am sorry it is not glenmorangie.
as long as it is scotch.  your white friends have abandoned you, paul.
the united nations are still here.
the united nations. madmen are on the streets, paul. but i will take care of you.  your cellar is well-stocked, right?
yes, general. i am glad you came by. i overheard something that i think you should know about.
what did you overhear?
a discussion between an american embassy official and a un colonel.
what did they say?
the american assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
watch everything? how? they are gone.
satellites.
satellites?
yes, they can photograph the epaulets on your shoulder.
and what will they do with these satellites?
the american said intervention is too costly, better to get photographic evidence and snatch up the high command.
the high command? our high command?
'snatch them up and put on a war crimes trial. lock them all away forever. no political risk, and big publicity.' that is what he said.  i thought I would better tell you.
the americans! who are they to put us on trial. let us imagine paul when their president kennedy was shot, they said it was a black man. then their politicians, their radio stations gave orders we must wipe out these black people before they wipe out us. what do you think would have happened? no different.
indeed, general. excuse me momentarily.
where has all our beer gone?
sir, gregoire has been taking beers.
how much beer?
many beers.
i am worried about thieves and criminals coming into the hotel. perhaps you could arrange for some police to guard us.
the police are very busy.
i understand general, but when i last talked to the president of sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect belgian property would be rewarded.
he did.
well rewarded those were his words.
if i were to spare a few policemen, where would i station them?
the front gate would be best, general.
i will see what i can do.
i admire you, general. how do you keep command of your men amidst such madness?
i am strong, paul, like a lion.
i wish i were like you. look at my staff, they will not work, they listen to no one.
paul, we would like to speak to you in your office.
we, who is we?
a delegation.
lynch bages, 84. perfect with lamb, or fine rare beef.
so where is the lamb?
maybe gregoire and the witch ate it.
what is the matter?
we are running out of beer and other supplies.
i have to go out to get food.
go out! where?
to rutagunda's place. it is close by.
no, no.
i have to, tatiana, we are only as valuable as the service we provide.
you cannot go alone.
I am not going alone. I will take gregoire with me. he is a good hutu, and he wants to impress me now.
gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
please, except my humblest apologies...
do not worry. i have a job this morning. i must go to visit my good friend george rutagunda. you know george?
where are we going, sir?
for supplies, you drive.
the fog is too heavy, sir.
just drive, gregoire.
what do you want?
we are to meet mr. rutagunda.
the commander is not here.
he will be here.
show me your id
excuse me.
what?
our cards, please.
what cards?
you have our cards.
no. but i make cards. would you like me to make you two cards?
how much?
one thousand francs.
everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
i need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
beer yes, but no whiskey.
you have no whiskey?
no whiskey, no spirits. your rich cockroaches at the hotel, they will have to do without their scotch. anyway, i have bled that cow enough paul.
what do you mean george?
their money is no good to them. soon all the ineysi will be dead.
) you cannot kill them all.
why not? we are half way there already.
let's go.
take the river road back. it is clear.
are you sure this is the river road?
i saw the sign.
please, paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
it is alright. this is the only place i can find some peace.
i hear we must pay for everything. how much for this?
a kiss.
i have a confession. when we met...
in ruhengeri?
yes, when you worked as the nurse.
yes.
i had you transferred to kigali.
what?
i bribed the minister of health to have you transferred to kigali.
why?
to be closer. so that i could marry you.
what was the bribe?  what am i worth to you?
it was substantial.
tell me what it was.
a car.
what sort of car?
what does it matter.
i want to know.
a volkswagen.
a volkswagen!
i will not leave without the twins.
we have to get out of here tatiana.
please, please try one more time.
I will try but we have to leave, with or without them. i want you to promise.
it is dangerous to be here. the radio says this is a nest of cockroaches.
i need one last favor. go back and get the twins.
no, it is impossible. that side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. the children are dead.
how do you know?
everyone is dead there. the dogs eat the bodies in the street. i have to go.
i will give you my house.
you are my family now, zozo, my brother. i will get you out of here.
thank you, sir.
let us remember this night and tell the world that even in hell there are good people.
a little longer, paul?
we wait until 7:00. if he is not here with the twins he is not coming. we leave. that was your promise. go help the children.
ask them to wait a little longer. for the twins.
get on the truck, tatiana.
no.
i have to stay.
no! sit down now.
i cannot leave these people. i will wait for the twins.
let me go. children get off.
i will follow on the next plane. go.
i love you. keep the children safe.
paul! then another voice.
i saw gregoire make a call, sir?
when?
as the trucks go.
please, general, i will give you money, whiskey.
you said you had no whiskey.
please, i have money. they are driving into an ambush, it is on the radio.
what is this about no water?
it is true, sir, the water has been turned off.
where are my supplies?
I am sorry, general. the cellar is empty.
you have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? did they drink my whiskey?
no. we have no way of finding other stock but i have money for you from the guests.
we are almost out of water.
we are almost out of everything.
we have to have a plan.
what sort of plan?
our children cannot see us die first. if the militia comes, you must hurry up to the roof. i will meet you there.
please do not talk like this.
we have to. if i do not come, you must take them all by the hands and jump.
they fired a rocket at us.
yes. where are the rwandan police?
i ran out of bribes. bizimungu took them away.
that explains it. I am sorry to tell you this but we have heard rumors the militia are getting ready to storm the hotel.
will you protect us.
i can't, i do not have the men.
what is it?
the rebels have fought their way into the city. they have many hutu prisoners.
this time the militia will kill us.
they will surely kill us here. it is over here. we have to take the chance.
paul, i need you to buy me a day or two. i do not have the fuel for this convoy. i will have to scrounge it.
i can't. i have nothing left to bribe with. can your men at the gate hold out for another day?
no, paul, they are afraid. they have demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
give me their uniforms. i will put people at the gate, in disguise.
i wish i could, paul. try to hold out.
the diplomat! tatiana wakens, startled.
what is wrong?
i have to go to the diplomat.
general, sir. i am glad to find you. i have found you some supplies.
whiskey?
the finest, and cognac, champagne. come and i will get them for you.
I will be over.
bring back your policemen...
we must go to the diplomat.
get in.
your police are at the gate?
after the diplomat! paul clambers in the back.
where are they going?
they can go where they want. they are in charge now.
what do you mean, general?
we have decided to move the government to gitarama.
when?
today.
you know what the scottish call it?
no.
ishca baha - the water of life. i went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. have you ever been to scotland?
no, sir.
wonderful country, wonderful golf. i wonder - will i ever go back? what do you think?
i hope we all get to do many things. can we go now?
pack those carefully, put them in my jeep, and guard them.
please, general, call and put your policemen back at the gate.
i am going to do you a great favor.  i am going to take you with us to gitarama.
i do not want to go to gitarama, general.
you cannot go back to the hotel. the crazy men are going there now. better to come with me.
we are better here.
listen, you need me.
you are a marked man.
how so.
the americans, and the un they have you as a war criminal. you are on a list.
i am on a list! what list?
when the europeans left, their soldiers gathered lists.
you lie.
if you do not help me, you will stay on that list.
i committed no war crimes.
who will tell them? you need me to tell how you helped the hotel. the others who have gone, they blame you for all their misfortune. they say you led the massacres.
i led no massacres.
you think they will believe you?
you will tell them the truth.
i will do nothing unless you help me now.
show us the manager. he wears a suit.
they have him in the lobby, go quickly.
they should go one truck at a time. when the first truck gets through to the airport, then the others will follow.
we can not wait. we all go together or not at all.
oh, my babies.
anais, it is so good to see you.
