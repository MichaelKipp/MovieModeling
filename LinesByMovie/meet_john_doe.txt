yeh, d. b. oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. okay.
look, mr. connell . . . i just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. i've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
i'll tell you what i'll do. i get thirty dollars a week. i'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. i'll do anything you say.
it isn't the money. we're after circulation. what we need is fireworks. people who can hit with sledge hammers—start arguments.
oh, i can do that. i know this town inside out. oh, give me a chance, please.
you're a couple o' sticks shy in your column, ann.
a big, rich slob like d. b. norton buys a paper—and forty heads are chopped off!
did you get it, too?
yeah. you, too? oh, joe . . . oh, i'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
before you do, ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column.
yeah. lavender and old lace!
spencer of the chronicle .
hold him.  yes, mrs. brewster, i'm listening.
yes, spencer. who? the governor? well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! and i'm up for re-election, too!
shh!
what are you doing? get connell at the bulletin !  why, he's liable to go right past my window,  what was that?!
what?
out the window! something just flew by!
i didn't see anything.
well, don't stand there, you idiot. go and look. open the window. oh, why did he have to pick on my building?
is there a crowd in the street?
no, sir.
then he may be caught on a ledge! look again!
i think it must have been a sea- gull.
a sea-gull? what's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? that's a bad omen, isn't it?
oh, n-no, sir. the sea-gull is a lovely bird.
i-it's all right, mrs. brewster. it was just a sea-gull.  er. nothing's happened yet! no, i'm watching. don't worry. ju-just leave it all to me!
i went up to miss mitchell's house, boss. boy, she's in a bad way.
where is she?
hey, do you know something? she supports a mother and two kids. what do you know about that?
did you find her?
no. her mother's awful worried about her. when she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. er, the girl, i mean!
go out and find her!
sure. hey, but the biggest thing i didn't tell you . . .
hello! . . . yeh?
her old man was doc mitchell. you know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? you remember that? okay, boss, i'll go and look for her.
no. i've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
i remember, distinctly, being fired.
that's right. but you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. and i'd like to have it!
what's that?
the letter.
what letter?
the letter from john doe.
oh!
the whole town's in an uproar. we've got to find him. the letter's our only clue.
there is no letter.
we'll get a handwriting expert to—  what!
there is no letter.
say that again.
there is no letter. i made it up.
you made it up.
uh-huh. you said you wanted fireworks.
just called the morgue, boss. they say there's a girl there—
shut up!
ann! say, why didn't yuh—
beany!
only one thing to do, hank. drop the whole business quickly.
how?
run a story. say john doe was in here, and is sorry he wrote the letter and—
that's right. you got it! sure! he came in here and i made him change his mind. "bulletin editor saves john doe's life." why, it's perfect. i'll have ned write it up.  oh, ned!
well, the whole town's curious about john doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. there's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
in what man!
john doe.
what john doe?
our john doe! the one i made up! look, genius— now, look. suppose there was a john doe—and he walked into this office. what would you do? find him a job and forget about the whole business, i suppose! not me! i'd have made a deal with him!
a deal?
sure!  when you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. why, this is good for at least a couple of months. you know what i'd do? between now and let's say, christmas, when he's gonna jump, i'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job!  a wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. the problem of the average man, of all the john does in the world.
now, then comes the drama. he meets discouragement. he finds the world has feet of clay. his ideals crumble. so what does he do?  he decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. he thinks of the river!  but no, no, he has a better idea. the city hall. why?  because he wants to attract attention. he wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
so?
very pretty. very pretty, indeed, miss mitchell. but would you mind telling me who goes on christmas eve?
john doe.
what john doe?
the one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
wait a minute. wait a minute. lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on christmas eve? is that it?
well, you're catching on.
who, for instance?
anybody! er, er—beany'll do!
miss mitchell, do me a favor, will you? go on out and get married and have a lot o' babies—but stay out o' newspaper business!
better get that story in, hank, it's getting late.
you're supposed to be a smart guy! if it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
holy smokes! wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
that's fine! that's fine!  now fall right into their laps. go ahead. say john doe walked in and called the whole thing off. you know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
that's all, ned. thank you.
hey, boss. get a load of this.
what?
look!
what do they want?
they all say they wrote the john doe letter.
if you ask me, hank, you're playing around with dynamite.
no, no, no, the gal's right. we can't let the chronicle get the laugh on us! we've got to produce a john doe now.  amateur journalism, huh!  i'll show those guys.
okay, sister, you get your job back.
plus a bonus.
what bonus?
i can read. i can read!
sorry.
so you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
oh, the chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
packs everything, including a gun.  okay, sister, you've got yourself a deal. now let's take a look at the candidates. the one we pick has gotta be the typical average man. typical american that can keep his mouth shut.
show me an american who can keep his mouth shut and—i'll eat him.
okay, beany, bring 'em in one at a time.  wipe to: montage: half a dozen different types of hoboes appear—and in each instance ann shakes her head, negatively.
did you write that letter to miss mitchell?
no, i didn't.
what are you doing up here then?
well, the paper said there were some jobs around loose. thought there might be one left over.
had any schooling?
yeah, a little.
what do you do when you work?
i used to pitch.
baseball?
uh-huh. till my wing[4] went bad.
where'd you play?
bush leagues mostly.[5] med. shot: to include the rest of them. they have their eyes glued on his face. ann is very much interested.
how about family? got any family?
no.
oh, just traveling through, huh?
yeah. me and a friend of mine. he's outside.
looks all right—
he's perfect! a baseball player. what could be more american!
i wish he had a family, though.
what's your name?
willoughby. john willoughby, long john willoughby they called me in baseball.
er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?
yeah, maybe.
would you be willing to say you wrote that letter—and stick by it?
oh, i get the idea. yeah, maybe.
that's our man. he's made to order.
i don't know. he don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
when you're desperate for money, you do a lot of things, mr. connell. he's our man, i tell you.
hurry up, pop.
oh.
right here. sit down.
huh?
are you all right?
yeah, i'm all right.
how many is that, six? pretty hungry, weren't you?
say, all this john doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
well, nobody asked yuh.
trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. you couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you!
don't mind the colonel. he hates people.
he likes you well enough to stick around.
oh, that's 'cause we both play doohickies. i met him in a box car a couple o' years ago. i was foolin' around with my harmonica and he comes over and joins in. i haven't been able to shake him since.
all right, boys, here he is.
no, no, no! you can't take pictures of him like that—eating a sandwich—and with a beard!
but, he's gonna jump off a building!
yes, but not because he's out of a job. that's not news! this man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
well, maybe you're right.
we'll clean him up and put him in a hotel room—under bodyguards. we'll make a mystery out of him.  did you speak to mr. norton?
thinks it's terrific. says for us to go the limit. wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
oh, swell! is that the contract?
yes.  what's he doing here?
friend of his. they play duets together.
duets? but can we trust him?
oh!
i trust him.
oh, you trust him, eh? well, that's fine. i suppose he trusts you, too?
oh, stop worrying. he's all right.
that's—
well, okay. but we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. now the first thing i want is an exact copy of the john doe letter in your own handwriting.
i got it all ready. here.
well, that's fine. now i want you to sign this agreement. it gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until christmas. on december twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. that's what you want, isn't it?
yeah, but it's got to be by bone- setter brown.
okay, bone-setter brown goes. here, sign it. meanwhile, here's fifty dollars for spending money. that's fine. beany!
yeah, boss?
take charge of him. get him a suite at the imperial and hire some bodyguards.
yeah, yeah, yeah.
both of 'em?
yes, both of 'em! but don't let him out of your sight.
okay, fellows.
take it easy, john doe.
and you! start pounding that typewriter. oh, boy! this is terrific!  no responsibilities on our part. just statements from john doe and we can blast our heads off.
before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
awwwww!
hey, pretty nifty, huh?
you ain't gonna get me to stay here.
sure, you are.
no, sir. that spot under the bridge where we slept last night's good enough for me.
gimme mine. i ain't staying! you know we were headed for the columbia river country before all this john doe business came up. you remember that, don't yuh?
sure. i remember . . . say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? mine did.
aw, long john . . . i tell you—it's no good. you're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. and don't pull that on me neither!
stop worrying, colonel. i'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
help yourself.
naw.
i've seen guys like you go under before. guys that never had a worry. then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. the first thing that happens to a guy—
hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
hey, stop worrying, colonel. fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
i seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!
hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
and let me tell you, long john. when you become a guy with a bank account, they got you.  yes sir, they got you!
who's got him?
the heelots!
who?
and when they get you, you got no more chance than a road-rabbit.
hey. who'd you say was gonna get him?
hey, doc, look. look, doc. gimme that again, will yuh? who's gonna get him?
the heelots!
who are they?
listen, sucker, yuh ever been broke?
sure. mostly often.
all right. you're walking along—not a nickel in your jeans—free as the wind—nobody bothers you—hundreds of people pass yuh by in every line of business—shoes, hats, automobiles, radio, furniture, everything. they're all nice, lovable people, and they let you alone. is that right?
you win, colonel. here's the fifty. go on out and get rid of it.
you bet i will! as fast as i can! gonna get some canned goods—a fishing rod, and the rest i'm gonna give away.
hello there. well, well! if it isn't the man about town!
all set, ann?
huh? oh, yes. let's go.  now, let's see. we want some action in these pictures.
action?
um-hum.
that's good.
no, no, no. this man's going to jump off a roof.
oh.
here. wait a minute. let me comb your hair. sit down. there. that's better.
here. sit down!  quiet, egghead!  all right, now, a serious expression.
can't. i'm feeling too good.
oh, come on, now. this is serious. you're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
with all of it?
yes, you're sore at the world. come on, now.
oh, crabby guy, huh?
yeah. no, no!  no! no, look. you don't have to smell the world!
well, all those guys in the bleachers think—
never mind those guys. all right, stand up. now let's see what you look like when you protest.
against what?
against anything. just protest.
you got me.
oh, look. i'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and i call it a ball. what would you do?
oh, yuh did, huh?
yes!
why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied—
grab it, eddie, grab it!
yeah, but it's got everybody sore. ads are being pulled—the governor's starting a libel suit—what's more, they all know john doe's a phoney—and they insist on seeing him.
well, what about it?  let them see him!  we'll go them one better. they can also hear him.  you own a radio station, mr. norton. why not put him on the air?
look. we can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. good night!  no telling what that screwball might do. i walked in yesterday—here he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
if you do, mr. norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! excuse me.
no, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
sure, it's a meal ticket for me. i admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like mr. norton who's trying to crash national politics.  that's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? you wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  well, put john doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. he can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
go down to the office and arrange for some radio time.
why, d. b., you're not going to fall for—
i want it as soon as possible.
okay. i just came in to get warm, myself. come on, let's go.
. . . er, this john doe idea is yours, huh?
yes, sir.
how much money do you get?
thirty dollars.
thirty dollars? well, er, what are you after? i mean, what do you want? a journalistic career?
money.
money?  well, i'm glad to hear somebody admit it. do you suppose you could write a radio speech that would put that fellow over?
oh, i'm sure i can.
do it, and i'll give you a hundred dollars a week.
a hundred dollars!
that's only the beginning. you play your cards right and you'll never have to worry about money again. oh, i knew it.
hello. whenever there's a pretty woman around, er—  this is my nephew, ted sheldon, miss mitchell.
how do you do.
thank you very much for everything.
and, miss mitchell—i think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
yes, sir.
stick a fork through me! i'm done. i'll never get this speech right.
oh, yes you will, ann dear . . . you're very clever.
yeah, i know. what are you looking for?
your purse. i need ten dollars.
what for? i gave you fifty just the other day.
yes, i know, dear, but mrs. burke had her baby yesterday. nine pounds! and there wasn't a thing in the house—and then this morning the community chest lady came around and—
and the fifty's all gone, huh? who's the ten for?
the websters.
the websters!
you remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? i thought i'd buy them some groceries. oh, ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor—
you're marvelous, ma. you're just like father used to be. do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
well, yes, i know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
if you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. it's practically gone. we owed everybody in town. now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away.
oh, i'm sorry, ma. oh, don't pay any attention to me. i guess i'm just upset about all this. gee whiz, here i am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and i'm stuck. if i could put this over, your mrs. burke can have six babies!
do you mean the speech you're writing?
yeah, i don't know. i simply can't get it to jell!  i created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
well, honey, of course i don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples i've read, i don't think anybody'll listen.
what?
darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. people are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. if you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? if your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
oh, yes, father certainly would.
wait a minute . . .
huh?
that's your father's diary, ann.
father's . . . i never knew he had a diary.
there's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. you be careful of it, won't you dear?  it's always helped keep your father alive for me.
you bet i will, ma.
ba-ll!
i don't know how you're gonna stand it around here till after christmas.
st-rike!
i know why you're hangin' around—you're stuck on a girl—that's all a guy needs is to get hooked up with a woman.
pretty good?  say, i was just about ready for the major leagues when i chipped a bone in my elbow. i got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!
nineteen!
yep. there was a major league scout there watching me, too. and he came down after the game with a contract. do you know what?  i couldn't life my arm to sign it. but i'll be okay again as soon as i get it fixed up.
that's too bad.
what do you mean, too bad?
huh? oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
well, what are you talking about? i just told you i was gonna get a—
well, you know how they are in baseball—if a guy's mixed up in a racket—
racket? what do you mean?
well, i was just thinking about this john doe business. why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you?
y-yeah. gee, doggone it, i never thought about that. gosh!
and another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? what are they gonna think about you?  close shot: of the colonel. he has dropped his glove—flopped into a chair—and has taken out his ocarina.
i gotta figure some way out of this thing!
the elevators are still runnin'.
i know one way you can do it.
how?
well, when you get up on the radio, all you have to do is say the whole thing's a frame-up. make you a hero sure as you're born!
yeah, but how am i gonna get my arm fixed?
well, that's a cinch. i know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
say, who's putting up this dough?
feller runs the chronicle .  here's the speech you make—and it's all written out for you.
now, look, john. here's the speech. it's in caps and double-spaced. you won't have any trouble reading it. not nervous, are you?
no.
of course not. he wouldn't be.
who?
john doe. the one in there.
have you got the speech i gave you?
yeah.
now, look. i'll give this money to the colonel just as soon as you get started. we'll have a car waiting at the side entrance for you.
okay.
who?
john doe, the one in the speech.
oh. yeah.
you know something? i've actually fallen in love with him.
what's the idea?
no, no, no. now that's too much!
listen. if that guy lays an egg. i want to get something out of it. i'm getting a jane doe ready!
that's fine, honey. now, get out!
holy smoke! a half a heelot!
there you are, boss, just like you ordered. symbols of the little people.
say, he's a friend of mine.
never mind. let him alone. he's all right. i'll be right over there pulling for you.
yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. it's lucky you got away from her.
what was i doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? me? huh?  gee, the more i think about it the more i could . . .
tear down all the fences. why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you!
five thousand bucks!  i had it right in my hand!
jitterbugs.[9] close shot: john and the colonel.
yeh. say, how much money we got left?
four bits.
better make it doughnuts, huh?
yeh.
join the john doe club.
john doe club?
better let me talk to him.
all right, but present it to him as a great cause for the common man.
hello, john.
hello.
look, mr. norton, i think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
there's nobody holding you here, mr. doe.  it's only natural that people—
well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. incidentally, my name isn't doe. it's willoughby.
look, john. something terribly important's happened. they're forming john doe clubs. we know of eight already and they say that there's going—
john doe clubs? what for?
uh-huh. to carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
i don't care what they're forming. i'm on my way and i don't like the idea of being stopped either.
oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. you should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
uh-huh . . .
well, you got your circulation. now, why don't you let me alone?
oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. mr. norton wants to get back of it and sponsor john doe clubs all over the country. he wants to send you on a lecture tour.
me?
uh-huh.
why, certainly. with your ability to influence people, it might grow into a glorious movement.
say, let's get something straight here. i don't want any part of this thing. if you've got an idea i'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! baseball's my racket, and i'm sticking to it. come on, colonel, let's get out of here.
well, i'll be doggoned if over forty people don't show up. 'course none of us knew what to do, but we sure got a kick out of seeing how glad everybody was just to say hello to one another.
tell him about making sourpuss chairman, honey.
oh, yeah. we made sourpuss chairman and decided to call ourselves the john doe club. and, say, incidentally, this is my wife. come here, honey.
this is sourpuss. er, excuse me. er, mr. smithers, mr. doe.
th—that's all right. if you didn't call me sourpuss, it wouldn't feel natural.  there are snickers from the background.
well, anyway, i—i guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the delaneys. the delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? until grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "say, you've got the delaneys all wrong." and then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "if you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
old man delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.
and then we started to find out about a lot of other people.
yeah, sure. er, you know grubbel, for instance.
grubbel's here. see?
yeah. that's—that's him. of course, you don't know grubbel, but he's the man that everybody figured was the worst no-account in the neighborhood because he was living like a hermit and nobody'd have anything to do with him. er, that is until murphy, the postman told us the truth. "why, grubbel," he says, "he lives out of garbage cans because he won't take charity. because it'd ruin his self-respect," he says.
just like you said on the radio, mr. doe.
well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave grubbel a job watering their lawns. isn't that wonderful? and then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
yeh. er, and my boss, mr. schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man delaney—
no!
well, thank you for listening. goodbye, mr. doe. you're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while.
well, i don't get it.
huh? get what?
look, d. b. i'm supposed to know my way around. this john doe movement costs you a fortune. this convention's gonna cost plenty.
well?
well, i'm stuck with two and two—but i'm a sucker if i can make four out of it.  where do you come in?
why—uh—
i see. i'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
i think maybe you'd better. and connell—i'd like to have the john doe contract, all the receipts for the money we have advanced him and the letter miss mitchell wrote, for which i gave her a thousand dollars.
yes. sure.
can i help you pack?
no, thank you.
do you care if i sit down out here?
no.
you know, i had a crazy dream last night. it was about you.
about me?
sure was crazy. i dreamt i was your father.
well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
well, a tall handsome ubangi, i suppose.
no, not that bad. it was a fella that sends you flowers every day. er, what's his name? mr. norton's nephew.
ted sheldon.
yeah, that's the one.
but here's the funniest part of it all. i was the fella up there doing the marrying. you know, the justice of the peace or something . . .
you were? i thought you were chasing me?
well, yes, i was. but i was your father then, see?  but the real me, john doe, er, that is, long john willoughby, i was the fellow up there with the book. you know what i mean?
i guess so. then what happened?
well, i took you across my knee and i started spanking you.
how many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, i mean?
i don't know. about three hundred thousand.
three hundred thousand? what makes them do it, ann? what makes them come and listen and, and get up their john doe clubs the way they do? i've been trying to figure it out.
look, john—what we're handing them are platitudes. things they've heard a million times: "love thy neighbor," "clouds have silver linings," "turn the other cheek." it's just a—
yeah, i've heard them a million times, too, but—there you are. maybe they're like me. just beginning to get an idea what those things mean.
oh, somebody else sitting there?
no, no, no—that's your seat.
oh! oh, it's beautiful, d. b. well—i don't quite know what to say . . .
well, don't say anything at all. just sit down.
oh!
go ahead, open it, open it.
tomorrow night, before a crowd of fifteen thousand people, and talking over a nation-wide radio hook-up, john doe will announce the formation of a third party.
a third party?
yes. the john doe party.
devoted entirely to the interests of all the john does all over the country. which practically means, ninety per cent of the voters. he will also announce the third party's candidate for the presidency. a man whom he, personally, recommends. a great humanitarian; the best friend the john does have.
mr. d. b. norton!
it's good to see you. sit down.
thanks.
it's for ann . . .
oh, how nice! thank you very much.
flowers.
i'm terribly sorry she isn't here.
she isn't?
no, she just left. i'm surprised you didn't run into her. she went over to mr. norton's house.
oh!
did you want to see her about something important?
yeah. i, uh, well . . . no. it'll wait.  say, he's a nice man, isn't he? mr. norton, i mean. he's, er, he's done an awful lot for the—
well, i guess i'll see her at the convention later.
yes, of course. i'll see that she gets the flowers.
thanks. good night, mrs. mitchell.
good night, john.
oh, yeah. that's what i mean. see? it was easy as all that, huh?
uh-huh.
yeah, yeah, but look, mrs. mitchell, you know i love ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best i ever was was a bush-league pitcher.
i bet you he'd know how to say it all right. and me, i get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but i never get right to it. do you know what i mean? so the only chance i've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
you mean you'd like me to do it, huh?
well, i was thinking that—yeah, you know, sort of break the ice.
hello, mr. connell.
hiyah, john.  john, i want to have a little talk with you.  what's the matter—are you falling? come here.
hey, boss.
oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.  say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
no, i never read the speeches before i make them. i get more of a kick out of it that way.
uh-huh. that's exactly what i thought. beany, go on down to the office, tell pop to give you the speech. there's a copy on my desk.
gee whiz, boss, you know mr. norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
go on, go on, go on. and we'll be at jim's bar up the street.
now, that's all right, isn't it?
you betcha.
i get mad for a lot of other guys besides myself—i get mad for a guy named washington! and a guy named jefferson—and lincoln. lighthouses, john! lighthouses in a foggy world! you know what i mean?
yeah, you bet!
listen, pal—this fifth column stuff's pretty rotten, isn't it?[11]
yeah. it certainly is.
and you'd feel like an awful sucker if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn't you?
you must be wrong, mr. connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the john doe clubs.
yeah?  say, you're sold on the john doe idea, aren't you?
sure.
sure. i don't blame you. so am i.
all right! now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are d. b., was trying to use that to shove his way into the white house. so he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. what would you say about that? huh?
nobody's gonna do that, mr. connell. they can't use the john doe clubs for politics. that's the main idea.
is that so? then what's a big political boss like hammett doing in town? and a labor leader like bennett? and a lot of other big shots who are up at d. b.'s house right now? wolves, john, wolves waiting to cut up the john does!  wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
you're all wet. miss mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
they can't, huh?  who do you think writes 'em? my aunt emma? i know she writes them.
don't write 'em? why, that gold- grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of chinese yen!
shut up! if you weren't drunk i'd—
hey, wait a minute, mr. doe!
. . . tubby?
hello?
john! i'm so glad to see you. i—i was terribly worried.
did you write this?
yes, i did, john. but i—i had no idea what was going on.
you didn't?
is there anything wrong?
oh, no. nothing's wrong. everything's fine!  so there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the john does, eh?  you forgot one detail, mr. big shot—you forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the john doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
now, hold on a minute, young man! hold on! that's rather big talk! i started the john doe clubs with my money and i'll decide whether or not they're being properly used!
no you won't! you're through deciding anything!
go ahead, driver! ball park!
john, please let me go with you! please, john!
how could he be a fake?
it must be some kind of a gag.
a what?
a gag. a gag!
that's a lie!
it's not a lie! nickels and dimes! to stuff into their own pockets! you can read all about it in the newspapers there!
that's a lie! listen—don't believe what he says . . .
let go of me!  this man had no intention of jumping off of the top of a building! he was paid to say so!  do you deny that?
that's got nothing to do with it!
were you paid for it—or weren't you?
yes! i was paid! but the—
and what about the suicide note? you didn't write that, either!
what difference does that make?
did you write it—or didn't you?
no, i didn't write it, but—
ah, you bet your life you didn't! you look in your papers, ladies and gentlemen, and you'll find miss mitchell's signed confession that she was the one that wrote it!
listen, folks, it's a fact that i didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started—
there! you see? he admits it! you're a fake, john doe! and for what you've done to all these good people—they ought to run you out of the country—and i hope they do it!
it makes no difference, bert—the ideas's still good. we don't have to give up our club.
yeah? well, you can have it!
now listen, ann—he can't possibly get in without our seeing him. i'm watching the side door and the colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
thank you.
that man is gonna be on that roof. don't ask me how i know. i just know. and you know it as well as i do.
sure, sure. i'd like to believe in fairy tales, but a guy that's fake isn't gonna jump off any roof.
colonel!
you shouldn't have gotten out of bed, miss.
has he been here?
no.
have you seen him?
i ain't seen him for a week.
where's connell?
he's watching the other door.
oh. gee, you're swell! oh.
no sense in going up there! i been here for hours. he ain't here!
oh, let me go, will you!
now, that's crazy. it's fourteen floors!
you don't have to—why, we're with you, mr. doe. we just lost our heads and acted like a mob. why, we . . .
what bert's trying to say is—well—we need you, mr. doe. there were a lot of us didn't believe what that man said.
