you will notice that my friends and i all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. mcdermott is the biggest asshole. van patten is the yes man. price is the most wired. I am the best looking. we all have light tans. right now I am in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and van patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
what are the rules for a sweater vest?
you think so?
you will look like you consciously worked for the look.
good point. excuse me, gentlemen.
van patten looks puffy. has he stopped working out?
it looks that way, does not it?
that is paul owen.
that is not paul owen. paul owen's on the other side of the room. over there.
there is this theory out now that if you can catch the aids virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
I am not sure, guy, but i do not think dyslexia is a virus.
oh, who knows? they do not know that. prove it.
jeez. that is not a helluva lot, is it?
maybe it is just the light.
is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  oh my god...
what?
it is a fucking milligram of sweet'n low!
it is definitely weak but i have a feeling if we do enough of it we will be okay.
i want to get high off this; bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking all-bran.
shut up!
calm down. let's do it anyway
i guess you are right...  that is, if the faggot in the next stall thinks it is okay!
late?
aerobics class. sorry. any messages?
ricky hendricks has to cancel today. he did not say what he was canceling or why.
i occasionally box with ricky at the harvard club. anyone else?
and...spencer wants to meet you for a drink at fluties pier 17.
when?
after six.
negative. cancel it.
oh? and what should i say?
just...say...no.
just say no?
okay, jean. i need reservations for three at camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try crayons. all right?
yes, sir.
oh, something. . romantic?
no, silly. forget it. I will make them. thanks.
I will do it.
no. no. be a doll and just get me a perrier, okay?
you look nice today.
yes?
is that the ransom file? thanks. do not wear that outfit again.
ummm...what? i did not hear you.
i said "do not wear that outfit again." wear a dress. a skirt or something.
you do not like this, i take it?
come on, you are prettier than that.
thanks, patrick.
marzipan. pink tents. hundreds, thousands of roses. photographers. annie leibovitz. we will get annie leibovitz. and we will hire someone to videotape. patrick, we should do it.
do...what.
get married. have a wedding.
evelyn?
yes, darling?
is your evian spiked?
we should do it.
no-i can not take the time off work.
your father practically owns the company. you can do anything you like, silly.
i do not want to talk about it.
well, you hate that job anyway. why do not you just quit? you do not have to work.
because i...want...to...fit...in.
pat, this is my cousin vanden and her boyfriend stash. he is an artist.
hi. pat bateman.
oh come on. price. there are a lot more important problems than sri lanka to worry about. sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
like what?
well, we have to end apartheid for one. and slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. but we can not ignore our social needs. either we have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. we have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.
why don t you just go for price?
oh god, patrick. why price? price?
he is rich.
everybody's rich.
he is good-looking.
everybody's good-looking, patrick.
he has a great body
everybody has a great body now.
are you using minoxidil?
no. I am not. why should i ?
your hairline looks like it is receding.
it is not.
hi, patrick. i thought that was you.
hello
well.
is not it ridiculous? coming all the way up here, but you know. they really are the best.
then why can not they get these stains out? i mean can you talk to these people or something? I am not getting anywhere.
well, i mean, um, it s really...bosco. you know, like... like a dove bar. it is a dove bar...hershey's syrup?
oh yeah. oh i get it. fun with chocolate.
listen, if you could talk to them  i would really appreciate it. I am really late. i have a lunch appointment at hubert's in fifteen minutes.
hubert's? oh really? it moved uptown, right?
yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I have got to go. thank you, uh... victoria?
maybe we could have lunch one day next week? you know, I am downtown near wall street quite often.
oh, i do not know, victoria. I am at work all the time.
well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a saturday?
next saturday?
yeah.
oh, can't, I am afraid. matine of les miserables. listen, I have really got to go. i'll-oh...christ...i'll call you.
okay. do.
listen, what are you doing tonight?
what? oh, i'm...busy.
listen, you are dating luis, he is in arizona. you are fucking me, and we have not made plans. what could you possibly be up to tonight?
stop it. i'm...
on a lot of lithium?
waiting for luis to call me. he said he would call tonight. oh do not be difficult, patrick.
you should come have dinner with me. courtney but-when?
am i confused or were we talking about tonight?
ummm . . yeah. luis is calling me tonight. i need to be home for that.
pumpkin?
yes?
pumpkin you are dating an asshole.
uh huh.
pumpkin you are dating the biggest dickweed in new york.
i know. stop it.
pumpkin, you are dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
patrick do not call me pumpkin anymore, okay? i have to go.
courtney? dinner?
i can't.
I am thinking dorsia.
dorsia's nice.
nice?
you like it there, do not you?
the question is do you like it, courtney? and will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
okay. yeah. what time?
eight?
pick me up?
sounds like I will have to. do not fall asleep, okay? wear something fabulous. dorsia, remember?
dorsia.
umm...yes...i know it is a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
a facial at elizabeth arden, which was really relaxing, then to the pottery bam where i bought this silver muffin dish.
is that donald trump's car?
oh god, patrick. shut up.
you know, courtney, you should take some more lithium. or have a diet coke. some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
i just want to have a child. just...two... perfect...children...
j&b. straight.
champagne on the rocks. oh-could i have that with a twist? she starts to sink back in her chair and bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
are we here?
yes.
this is dorsia?
yes, dear.
courtney, you are going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. new york magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." you will love it. and then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. i think that will follow nicely.
mmmm...thanks, patrick.
luis is a despicable twit.
yes, luis is a despicable twit. i hate him.
no, you idiot. i said "is it a receptacle tip?" not, is luis a despicable twit. is it a receptacle tip? get off me.
is it a what?
pull out.
I am ignoring you.
pull out, goddamnit!
what do you want, courtney?
it is a plain end. i think.
turn the light on.
oh jesus. I am going home.
patrick. turn on the light. he turns on the light.
it is a plain end, see? so?
take it off.
why?
because you have to leave half an inch at the tip   to catch the force of the ejaculate! bateman I am getting out of here. where is your lithium?
oh christ, this really is not worth it. and see, courtney, it is there for what? huh? tell us.  why is it pulled down half an inch? so it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
well, it is not a turn-on for me. i have a promotion coming to me. i do not want to get aids.
see? happy? you dumb bitch? are you happy, you dumb bitch?
oh god, just get it over with.
patrick, thanks so much for looking after courtney. dorsia, how impressive! how on earth did you get a reservation there?
lucky, i guess.
that is a wonderful jacket. let me guess, valentino couture?
uh huh.
it looks so soft.
your compliment was sufficient luis.
hello, halberstam. nice tie. how the hell are you?
I have been great. and you?
how is the ransom account going, marcus?
it's...it's...all right.
really? that is interesting.  not great?
oh well, you know.
and how is cecilia? she is a great girl.
oh yes. I am very lucky.
what is that, a gram?
new card. what do you think?
picked them up from the printers yesterday
good coloring.
that is bone. and the lettering is something called silian rail.
eggshell with romalian type.  what do you think?
nice.
i can not believe that price prefers mcdermott's card to mine.
but wait. you am not seen nothin' yet.
raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
impressive. very nice. let's see paul owen's card.
I am so hungry.
it is cold out, too, is not it?
I am so hungry.
why do not you get a job? if you are so hungry, why do not you get a job?
i lost my job...
why? were you drinking? is that why you lost it? insider trading? just joking. no, really-were you drinking on the job?
gee, uh, that is too bad.
I am so hungry.
why do not you get another one? why do not , you get another job?
I am not...
you are not what? qualified for anything else?
I am hungry
i know that, i know that. jeez, you are like a broken record. I am trying to help you.
I am hungry.
listen, do you think it is fair to take money from people who do have jobs? from people who do work?
what am i gonna do?
listen, what is your name?
al.
speak up. come on.
al.
get a goddamn job, al. you have got a negative attitude. that is what is stopping you. you have got to get your act together. I will help you.
you re so kind, mister. you are kind. you are a kind man. i can tell.
shhhh...it's okay.
please...i don know what to do. I am so cold.
do ,you know how bad you smell? the stench, my god.
i can't...i can not find a shelter
you reek. you reek of...shit. do you know that?  goddammit, al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot. al...i'm sorry.
marcus halberstam. for two at eight?
your friend has already been seated. follow me, mr. halberstam.
listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
yeah, well, you are late.
hey, I am a child of divorce. give me a break  hmmm, i see they have omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
we should have gone to dorsia. i could have gotten us a table.
nobody goes there anymore.
so, was not rothschild originally handling the fisher account? how did you get it?
i could tell you that, halberstam, but then I would have to kill you.
and cecelia, how is she? where is she tonight?
cecelia is, well...you know
evelyn. great ass. goes out with that loser patrick bateman. what a dork.
another martini, paul?
paul, give me your amex card. good boy. bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
two-hundred-and-fifty. very reasonable. let's leave a big tip, shall we? my place hr a nightcap?
no, man. I am going to bail.
come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  I have got a preview of the barneys catalogue and a bottle of absolut waiting for us.
you like huey lewis and the news?
they are okay. bateman their early work was a little too new wave for my taste. but then sports came out in 1983, i think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
hey, halberstam?
yes, owen?
why are there copies of the style section all over the place? do you have a dog? a chow or something?
no, owen.
is that a raincoat?
yes, it is.
patrick? is that you?
no, luis. it is not me. you are mistaken.
this is gwendolyn ichiban. this is my very good friend patrick bateman. where are you going? we are going to nell's. gwendolyn's father's buying it.  where did you get your overnight bag?
commes des garcon.
call me please, patrick.
jesus lives, luis.
what is it?
patrick?
ye-es, je-an?
patrick, a mr. donald kimball is here to see you.
who?
detective donald kimball?
tell him I am at lunch.
patrick, i think he knows you are here. it is only ten-thirty.
listen, john, I have got to go. t boone pickens just walked in...  just joking...  no do not tip the owner of the salon. okay, john, right, got it.  sorry about that.
no, I am sorry. i should have made an appointment.  was that anything important?
oh that? just mulling over business problems. examining opportunities...exchanging rumors... spreading gossip.
hi. I am donald kimball
hi. pat bateman. nice to meet you.
I am sorry to barge in on you like this. but i was supposed to talk to luis carruthers and he was not in and...well, you are here, so...i know how busy you guys can get.
so, what is the topic of discussion?
I have been hired by meredith powell to investigate the disappearance of paul owen.
you are not with the fbi or anything, are you?
nothing like that. I am just a private investigator.
ah, i see...yes. paul's disappearance...yes.
so it is nothing that official. i just have some basic questions. about paul owen. about yourself-
coffee?
no. I am okay.
perrier? san pellegrino?
no, I am okay.
patrick?
can you bring mr...
kimball.
mr. kimball a bottle of san pelle-
oh no, I am okay.
it is no problem
well, what is the topic of discussion?
the disappearance of paul owen.
oh right. well, i have not heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  not on "page six" at least.
i think his family wants this kept quiet.
understandable.  lime?
no, really. I am okay.
you sure? i can always get you a lime.
just some preliminary questions that i need for my own files, okay?
shoot.
how old are you?
twenty-six. I will be twenty-seven in october.
where did you go to school?
harvard. the harvard business school.
your address?
fifty-five west eighty-first street. the american gardens building.
nice. very nice.
thanks.
pardon me, but are you okay?
who do you ask?
you seem...nervous.
bad habit.
i know. I am sorry.
would you rather i not smoke?
no, i guess it is okay.
you sure?
no problem.
yes, patrick?
bring us an ashtray for mr. kimball, please. she whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
what can you tell me about paul owen?
well...
how well did you know him?
i'm...at a loss. he was part of that whole...yale thing, you know.
yale thing?
yeah...yale thing.
what do you mean...yale thing?
so...there's nothing you can tell me about paul owen?
he led what i suppose was an orderly life. he... ate a balanced diet.
what kind of man was he? besides...  the information you have just given.
i hope I am not being cross-examined here.
do you feel that way?
no. not really.
where did paul hang out?
hang...out?
yeah. you know...hang out.
let me think. the newport. harry's. fluties. endochine. nell's. comell club. the new york yacht club. the regular places.
he had a yacht?
no, he just hung out there.
and where did he go to school?
do not you know this?
i just wanted to know if you know. bateman before yale? if i remember correctly, saint paul's... listen, i just...i just want to help.
anything else you can tell me about owen?
we were both seven in 1969.
so was i.
do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
well, there is a message on his answering machine saying he went to london.
well, maybe he did, huh?
his girlfriend does not think so.
but...has anyone seen him in london?
actually, yes.
hmmm.
well, I have had a hard time getting an actual verification. a stephen hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but i checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a hubert ainsworth for paul, so...
oh.
was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or satan worship?
what?
i know it sounds like a lame question, but in new jersey i know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-i do not know if you have heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
yikes! no. paul was not into that. he followed a balanced diet and-
yeah, i know, and was into that whole yale thing.
have you consulted a psychic?
no.
had his apartment been burglarized?
no, it actually hadn't. toiletries were missing. a suit was gone. so was some luggage. that is it.
i mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
no, not yet. as i said, we are not sure. but... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
that is so typical, is not it?
it is just strange.  one day someone is walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
nothing.
people just...disappear.
the earth just opens up and swallows people.
eerie. really eerie.
you will have to excuse me. i have a lunch meeting with cliff huxtable at four seasons in twenty minutes.
is not the four seasons a little far uptown? i mean are not you going to be late?
uh, no. there is one...down here.
oh really? i did not know that.
listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
absolutely, I am 100% with you.
great, and thanks for your, uh, time, mr. bateman.
i have not seen you around here.
you just have not been looking.
would you like to see my apartment?
do you want to come to my apartment or not?
I am not supposed to.  but i can make an exception.
do you take american express?
you have a really nice place here...paul. how much did you pay for it?
actually, that is none of your business, christie, hut i can assure you it certainly was not cheap.
but laurie kennedy is a total hardbody. what do you think, bateman?
i know her. i knew her.
because he dated her.
how did you guess?
girls dig bateman. he is cq. you are total cq, bateman.
thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
do you know what ed gein said about women?
ed gein? maitre d' at canal bar?
no, serial killer, wisconsin in the fifties. he was an interesting guy.
listen, what about dinner?
is that all you ever have to contribute, van patten? "what about fucking dinner?"
what...is...it?
where are you going?
I have gotta...i've gotta...return some videotapes.
patrick?
what? carruthers  I will call you.
will you call me before thanksgiving?
maybe.
what are you doing tonight?
dinner at the river cafe. au bar afterwards, maybe.
that is nice.
you and...luis?
we were supposed to have dinner at tad and maura's, but-you know how luis is...
i never knew you smoked.
you never noticed.
listen...patrick. can we talk?
you look marvelous. there is nothing to say. you are going to marry luis. next week, no less.
is not that special?  patrick?
yes, courtney?
patrick?
yes?
nothing.
detective kendall...uh campbell? kimball kimball.  call me don.
don.
so...you hang out here a lot?
uh, yes...i mean...whenever necessary. you know.
how is the investigation going? taken anyone in for "formal questioning?"
0h no. informal conversations, mostly. what is that, stoli?
yeah. no finlandia, as usual. fucking dump.
too true. you know, bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they are in a relaxed setting, do not you think?
i mean they want to get caught.
dan, great to see you again. like i said, you need anything at all, I am your man. i do not envy your job. i mean owen was a...complex man.
yes, caron's right. gorbachev's not downstairs. he is at tunnel.
ask me a question.
so, what do you do?
what do you think i do?
a model? an actor?
no. flattering, but no.
well...
i m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
welt...it depends, why?
well, most guys i know who work in mergers and acquisitions do not really like it.
I am leaving. I am getting out.
leaving what?
this.
don't, I will drink it.
listen to me, patrick. I am leaving.
where to? are you going to go get a gram?
I am leaving! i...am...leaving!
do not tell me...merchant banking?
no, you dumb son of a bitch. I am serious. I am disappearing.
where to? morgan stanley? rehab? what?
oh really? daisy he said...  he said you gave him bad vibes.
that's...that's too bad.
you think I am dumb, do not you?
what?
you think I am dumb. you think all models are dumb.
no. i really don't.
that is okay. i do not mind. there is something sweet about you.
jean?
yes, patrick?
would you like to accompany me to dinner?
that is...if you are not doing anything.
oh no. i have no plans.
well, is not this a coincidence.
anywhere you want?
let's not think about what i want. how about anywhere you want.
oh patrick, i can not make this decision.
no, come on. anywhere you want.
oh, i can't.  i do not know.
come on. where do you want to go? anywhere you want. just say it. i can get us in anywhere.
soooo...dorsia is where jean wants to go...
oh, i do not know. no, we will go anywhere you want.
dorsia is...fine.
dorsia, yes?
yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
we are totally booked.
oh really? that is great.
i said we are totally booked.
two at nine? perfect.
there are no tables available tonight. the waiting list is also totally booked.
see you then.
yes? you are dressed...okay.
you did not give them a name.
they know me.
jean? sorbet?
thanks, patrick. I would love some.
want a bite?
I am on a diet. but thank you.
you do not need to lose any weight. you are kidding, right? you look great. very fit.
you can always he thinner. look...better.
well, maybe we should not go out to dinner. i do not want to ruin your willpower.
no. it is all right. I am not very good at controlling it anyway.
and do not tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
well, I would like to travel. and maybe go back to school, but i really do not know...i'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I am so... i do not know...unsure.
do you have a boyfriend?
no, not really.
interesting.
are you seeing anyone? i mean, seriously?
maybe. i do not know not really. bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
jean, do you feel...fulfilled? i mean, in your life?
well, i guess i do. for a long time i was too focused on my work, i think, but now I have really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
growing. I am glad you said that.
did you know that ted bundy's first dog, a collie, was named lassie? had you heard this?
who is ted bundy?
forget it.
what is that?
oh. uh, tape. duct tape. i...need it for... taping something. bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
what...no! put it in the carton.
sorry.
jean? what?
make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
I am looking for...i guess you could say i just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
hmmmm.
yes. i don t think i can...control myself.
i know i should go. i know i have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...i mean, do you want me to go?
if you stay, i think something bad will happen. i think i might hurt you.  you do not want to get hurt, do you?
no. no, i guess not. i do not want to get bruised. you are right, i should go.
and do not forget you have a breakfast meeting with frederick bennet and charles rust at '21.
thanks. it slipped my mind completely.
i actually came to see timothy price, but he is taken a leave of absence.
yeah, gone into rehab. shame.  is he a suspect?
not really.
do you remember where you were on the night of paul's disappearance?  which was on the twentieth of december?
god...i guess...i was probably returning videotapes.
i had a date with a girl named veronica.
wait. that is not what I have got.
what?
that is not the information I have received.
well...i...wait...what information have you received?
let's see...  that you were with-
well, i could he wrong.
well...when was the last time you were with paul owen?
we had...gone to a new musical called...oh africa, brave africa. it was...a laugh riot...and that is about it. i think we had dinner at orso's. no, petaluma. no, orso's. the...last time i physically saw him was...at an automated teller. i can not remember which...just one that was near, um, nell's.
well, thank you, mr. bateman.
patrick, please. i hope I have been informative. long day-a bit scattered.
listen, I am a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I have sorted out all this information?
great, yes, I would like that.
and if you could try and pin down where you were the night of owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
absolutely. I am with you on that one.
never. i mean...i do not really like... singers.
not a big music fan, eh?
no, i like music. just-they're-huey's too... black sounding. for me.
well, to each his own. so-lunch, thursday? I will call your secretary about reservations.
I will be there.
I am not so sure about this. i had to go to emergency after last time...
oh this will not be anything like last time, i promise.
i do not think so.
nothing like last time, promise.
alright.
so, you are looking great, how have you been?
well, i actually might need a little surgery after last time.
really?
my friend told me i should maybe even get a lawyer.
oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. here.
this is nicer than your other apartment.
it is not that nice.
what do you mean, she was a hot number.
if you had an american express card she would give you a blowjob.  listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need i say more?...what do you do?
she is my...cousin.
uh huh?
she is from...france.
elizabeth, it is three in the morning.
he is a goddamn drug dealer! these are his peak hours.
do not tell him you are here.
why would i?
this tastes weird.  harley? it is me. i need your services. translate that anyway you would like. I am at-
you are at paul owen s.
who?
paul owen.
i want the number, idiot.  anyway, I am at paul norman's and I will try you later and if i do not see you at canal bar tomorrow night I am going to sic my hairdresser on you.
did you know that guy who disappeared? did not he work at pierce & pierce, too? was he a friend of yours?
no.
do you have any coke? or halcyon? I would take a halcyon.
listen, i would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. what is wrong with that? it is totally disease-free.
patrick, you re a lunatic.
come on. do not you find christie attractive?
let's not get lewd.  I am in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
come on. i think it would be a turn-on.
does he do this all the time?
are you telling me you have never gotten it on with a girl?
no! I am not a lesbian. why do you think I would be into that?
well, you went to sarah lawrence for one thing.
those are sarah lawrence guys, patrick. you are making me feel weird.
did you know that whitney houston's debut lp called simply whitney houston had four number-one singles on it? did you know that, christie? whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she is mainly a jazz singer-that it is hard to take in the album on a first listening.
you actually listen to whitney houston? you actually have a whitney houston cd? more than one?
i want a firm commitment.
i think, evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
why? what is wrong?
my need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but i have no other way to fulfill my needs.
we need to talk.
talk about what, patrick? what is there to talk about?
it is over, evelyn. it is all over
touchy, touchy. I am sorry i brought the wedding up. let's just avoid the issue, alright? now, are we having coffee?
I am fucking serious. it is fucking over. us. this is no joke. i do not think we should see each other anymore.
but your friends are my friends. my friends are your friends. i do not think it would work.  you have a little something on your upper lip.
i know that your friends are my friends. I have thought about that. you can have them.
you are really serious, are not you?
yes, i am.
but what about the past? our past?
we never really shared one.
you are inhuman.
i'm...in touch with humanity. evelyn, I am sorry.  you are just not terribly important to me.
no, no, no.
i know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
if you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
oh god, i can not believe this.
I am leaving now. I have assessed the situation and I am going.
where are you going?
I am just leaving.
but where?
i have to return some videotapes.
no hash browns?
not in the mood, i guess.
but...everyone orders the hash browns here. i mean- it's-have you been here before?
yes, of course. the hash browns are delicious. I am just...not... ordering them.
suit yourself, i guess.
so, the night he disappeared? any new thoughts on what you did?
I am not really sure. i had a shower...and some sorbet?
i think maybe you have got your dates mixed up.
but how? where do you place paul that night?
according to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...marcus halberstam.
and?
I have questioned him.
marcus?
yes. and he denies it. though at first he could not be sure.
but marcus denied it?
yes.
well, does marcus have an alibi?
yes.
he does? you are sure?
i checked it out. it is clean.
oh. kimball now where were you?
where was marcus?
he was not with paul owen.
so who was he with?
he was at atlantis with craig mcdermott, frederick dibble, harry newman, george butner and   - you.
oh, right. of course...we had wanted paul owen to come. but he said he had plans...i guess i had dinner with victoria...the following night.
personally i think the guy went a little nutso. split town for a while. maybe he did go to london. sightseeing. drinking. whatever. anyway, I am pretty sure he will turn up sooner or later.  i mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. is not that right, patrick?
are you my two o'clock?
no.
can i help you?
I am looking for...paul owen's...place.
does not he live here?
no, he doesn't.
are you sure?
you saw the ad in the times?
no. yes. i mean yes, i did. in the times. but... does not paul owen still live here?
there was no ad in the times.
i think you should go now.
but i think...i want to know what happened here.
do not make any trouble. please. i suggest you go.
do not come back.
i won't...don't worry.
patrick bateman's office.
jean? hello? jean?
patrick? is that you?
hello? jean, i need help!
where are you?
jean-i'm not-
craig mcdermott called. he wants to meet you and david van patten and tim price at harry's for drinks.
oh god, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
patrick? i can not hear you.
what are i doing?
where are you? patrick, what is wrong?
i do not think I am going to make it, jean.
...to the office this afternoon.
why?
just...say...no!
what is it, patrick? are you alright?
stop sounding so fucking sad! jesus!
excuse me, gentlemen. right back. he approaches carnes cautiously.
face it-the japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
jesus, davis. yes. that was hilarious. that was you, was not it?
yes, naturally.
bateman killing owen and the escort girls? oh that s fabulous. that is rich...
it was a pretty long message, was not it?
what exactly do you mean?
the message you left.
by the way davis, how is cynthia? you are still seeing her, right?
but wait, harold, what do you mean?
carnes? wait.
davis. I am not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. but come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that i could not fully appreciate it. i was not fooled for a second. now, if you would said price, or mcdermott...otherwise, it was amusing. now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. hilarious, davis. a killer.
what are you talking about? bateman is what?
oh christ. he can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
now, if you will excuse me, i really must...
wait. stop. you do not seem to understand. you are not really comprehending any of this. i killed him. i did it, carnes. I am patrick bateman. i chopped owen's fucking head off. i tortured dozens of girls. the whole message i left on your machine was true.
excuse me. i really must he going.
no! listen, do not you know who i am? I am not davis, I am patrick bateman! i talk to you on the phone all the time! do not you recognize me? you are my lawyer.
now, carnes, listen to me. listen very, very carefully. i killed paul owen and i liked it. i can not make myself any clearer
but that is simply not possible. and i do not find this funny anymore.
it never was supposed to he! why is not it possible?
it is just not.
why not, you stupid bastard?
because i had dinner with paul owen twice in london...just ten days ago.
no, you...didn't?
now, if you will excuse me.
how can he lie like that? how can he pull that shit?
what shit? now where do we have reservations at? i mean I am not really hungry, but i would like to have reservations somewhere.
i do not believe it. he looks so...normal. he seems so... out of it. so...undangerous.
i just do not see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. how can you be so fucking, i do not know, cool about it?
some guys are just born cool, i guess.
and bateman, what are you so fucking zany about?
I am just a happy camper. rockin' and a-rollin'. van patten  rehab's done wonders for you, pal. working for unicef now?
