you'll notice that my friends and i all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. mcdermott is the biggest asshole. van patten is the yes man. price is the most wired. i'm the best looking. we all have light tans. right now i'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and van patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress .
what are the rules for a sweater vest?
you think so?
you'll look like you consciously worked for the look.
good point. excuse me, gentlemen.
van patten looks puffy. has he stopped working out?
it looks that way, doesn't it?
that's paul owen.
that's not paul owen. paul owen's on the other side of the room. over there.
there's this theory out now that if you can catch the aids virus through having sex with someone who is infected, then you can also catch anything-alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for christ's sake-you can get dyslexia from pussy-
i'm not sure, guy, but i don't think dyslexia is a virus.
oh, who knows? they don't know that. prove it.
jeez. that's not a helluva lot, is it?
maybe it's just the light.
is he fucking selling it by the milligram?  oh my god...
what?
it's a fucking milligram of sweet'n low!
it's definitely weak but i have a feeling if we do enough of it we'll be okay.
i want to get high off this; bateman, not sprinkle it on my fucking all-bran.
shut up!
calm down. let's do it anyway
i guess you're right...  that is, if the faggot in the next stall thinks it's okay!
late?
aerobics class. sorry. any messages?
ricky hendricks has to cancel today. he didn't say what he was canceling or why.
i occasionally box with ricky at the harvard club. anyone else?

when?
after six.
negative. cancel it.
oh? and what should i say?
just...say...no.
just say no?
okay, jean. i need reservations for three at camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try crayons. all right?
yes, sir.
oh, something. . romantic?
no, silly. forget it. i'll make them. thanks.
i'll do it.
no. no. be a doll and just get me a perrier, okay?
you look nice today.
yes?
is that the ransom file? thanks. don't wear that outfit again.
ummm...what? i didn't hear you.
i said "do not wear that outfit again." wear a dress. a skirt or something.
you don't like this, i take it?
come on, you're prettier than that.
thanks, patrick.
marzipan. pink tents. hundreds, thousands of roses. photographers. annie leibovitz. we'll get annie leibovitz. and we'll hire someone to videotape. patrick, we should do it.
do...what.
get married. have a wedding.
evelyn?
yes, darling?
is your evian spiked?
we should do it.
no-i can't take the time off work.
your father practically owns the company. you can do anything you like, silly.
i don't want to talk about it.
well, you hate that job anyway. why don't you just quit? you don't have to work.
because i...want...to...fit...in.
pat, this is my cousin vanden and her boyfriend stash. he's an artist.
hi. pat bateman.
oh come on. price. there are a lot more important problems than sri lanka to worry about. sure our foreign policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.
like what?
well, we have to end apartheid for one. and slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. but we can't ignore our social needs. either we have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. we have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice.
why don t you just go for price?
oh god, patrick. why price? price?
he's rich.
everybody's rich.
he's good-looking.
everybody's good-looking, patrick.
he has a great body
everybody has a great body now.
are you using minoxidil?
no. i'm not. why should i ?
your hairline looks like it's receding.
it's not.
hi, patrick. i thought that was you.
hello
well.
isn't it ridiculous? coming all the way up here, but you know. they really are the best.
then why can't they get these stains out? i mean can you talk to these people or something? i'm not getting anywhere.
well, i mean, um, it s really...bosco. you know, like... like a dove bar. it's a dove bar...hershey's syrup?
oh yeah. oh i get it. fun with chocolate.
listen, if you could talk to them  i would really appreciate it. i'm really late. i have a lunch appointment at hubert's in fifteen minutes.
hubert's? oh really? it moved uptown, right?
yeah, well, oh boy, listen, i've got to go. thank you, uh... victoria?
maybe we could have lunch one day next week? you know, i'm downtown near wall street quite often.
oh, i don't know, victoria. i'm at work all the time.
well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a saturday?
next saturday?
yeah.
oh, can't, i'm afraid. matine of les miserables. listen, i've really got to go. i'll-oh...christ...i'll call you.
okay. do.
listen, what are you doing tonight?
what? oh, i'm...busy.
listen, you're dating luis, he's in arizona. you're fucking me, and we haven't made plans. what could you possibly be up to tonight?
stop it. i'm...
on a lot of lithium?
waiting for luis to call me. he said he'd call tonight. oh don't be difficult, patrick.
you should come have dinner with me. courtney but-when?
am i confused or were we talking about tonight?
ummm . . yeah. luis is calling me tonight. i need to be home for that.
pumpkin?
yes?
pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
uh huh.
pumpkin you're dating the biggest dickweed in new york.
i know. stop it.
pumpkin, you're dating a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.
patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? i have to go.
courtney? dinner?
i can't.
i'm thinking dorsia.
dorsia's nice.
nice?
you like it there, don't you?
the question is do you like it, courtney? and will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
okay. yeah. what time?
eight?
pick me up?
sounds like i'll have to. don't fall asleep, okay? wear something fabulous. dorsia, remember?
dorsia.
umm...yes...i know it's a little late but is it possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty perhaps?
a facial at elizabeth arden, which was really relaxing, then to the pottery bam where i bought this silver muffin dish.
is that donald trump's car?
oh god, patrick. shut up.
you know, courtney, you should take some more lithium. or have a diet coke. some caffeine might get you out of this slump.
i just want to have a child. just...two... perfect...children...
j&b. straight.
champagne on the rocks. oh-could i have that with a twist? she starts to sink back in her chair and bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
are we here?
yes.
this is dorsia?
yes, dear.
courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. new york magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." you'll love it. and then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. i think that'll follow nicely.
mmmm...thanks, patrick.
luis is a despicable twit.
yes, luis is a despicable twit. i hate him.
no, you idiot. i said "is it a receptacle tip?" not, is luis a despicable twit. is it a receptacle tip? get off me.
is it a what?
pull out.
i'm ignoring you.
pull out, goddamnit!
what do you want, courtney?
it's a plain end. i think.
turn the light on.
oh jesus. i'm going home.
patrick. turn on the light. he turns on the light.
it's a plain end, see? so?
take it off.
why?
because you have to leave half an inch at the tip   to catch the force of the ejaculate! bateman i'm getting out of here. where's your lithium?
oh christ, this really isn't worth it. and see, courtney, it's there for what? huh? tell us.  why is it pulled down half an inch? so it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
well, it's not a turn-on for me. i have a promotion coming to me. i don't want to get aids.
see? happy? you dumb bitch? are you happy, you dumb bitch?
oh god, just get it over with.
patrick, thanks so much for looking after courtney. dorsia, how impressive! how on earth did you get a reservation there?
lucky, i guess.
that's a wonderful jacket. let me guess, valentino couture?
uh huh.
it looks so soft.
your compliment was sufficient luis.
hello, halberstam. nice tie. how the hell are you?
i've been great. and you?
how's the ransom account going, marcus?
it's...it's...all right.
really? that's interesting.  not great?
oh well, you know.
and how's cecilia? she's a great girl.
oh yes. i'm very lucky.
what's that, a gram?
new card. what do you think?
picked them up from the printers yesterday
good coloring.
that's bone. and the lettering is something called silian rail.
eggshell with romalian type.  what do you think?
nice.
i can't believe that price prefers mcdermott's card to mine.
but wait. you ain't seen nothin' yet.
raised lettering, pale nimbus white...
impressive. very nice. let's see paul owen's card.
i'm so hungry.
it's cold out, too, isn't it?
i'm so hungry.
why don't you get a job? if you're so hungry, why don't you get a job?
i lost my job...
why? were you drinking? is that why you lost it? insider trading? just joking. no, really-were you drinking on the job?
gee, uh, that's too bad.
i'm so hungry.
why don't you get another one? why don't , you get another job?
i'm not...
you're not what? qualified for anything else?
i'm hungry
i know that, i know that. jeez, you're like a broken record. i'm trying to help you.
i'm hungry.
listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? from people who do work?
what am i gonna do?
listen, what's your name?
al.
speak up. come on.
al.
get a goddamn job, al. you've got a negative attitude. that's what's stopping you. you've got to get your act together. i'll help you.
you re so kind, mister. you're kind. you're a kind man. i can tell.
shhhh...it's okay.
please...i don know what to do. i'm so cold.
do ,you know how bad you smell? the stench, my god.
i can't...i can't find a shelter
you reek. you reek of...shit. do you know that?  goddammit, al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot. al...i'm sorry.
marcus halberstam. for two at eight?
your friend has already been seated. follow me, mr. halberstam.
listen, the mud soup and the charcoal arugula are outrageous here.
yeah, well, you're late.
hey, i'm a child of divorce. give me a break  hmmm, i see they've omitted the pork loin with lime jello.
we should've gone to dorsia. i could've gotten us a table.
nobody goes there anymore.
so, wasn't rothschild originally handling the fisher account? how did you get it?
i could tell you that, halberstam, but then i'd have to kill you.
and cecelia, how is she? where is she tonight?
cecelia is, well...you know
evelyn. great ass. goes out with that loser patrick bateman. what a dork.
another martini, paul?
paul, give me your amex card. good boy. bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.
two-hundred-and-fifty. very reasonable. let's leave a big tip, shall we? my place hr a nightcap?
no, man. i'm gonna bail.
come on, you dumb son of a bitch.  i've got a preview of the barneys catalogue and a bottle of absolut waiting for us.
you like huey lewis and the news?
they're okay. bateman their early work was a little too new wave for my taste. but then sports came out in 1983, i think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically.
hey, halberstam?
yes, owen?
why are there copies of the style section all over the place? do you have a dog? a chow or something?
no, owen.
is that a raincoat?
yes, it is.
patrick? is that you?
no, luis. it's not me. you're mistaken.
this is gwendolyn ichiban. this is my very good friend patrick bateman. where are you going? we're going to nell's. gwendolyn's father's buying it.  where did you get your overnight bag?
commes des garcon.
call me please, patrick.
jesus lives, luis.
what is it?
patrick?
ye-es, je-an?
patrick, a mr. donald kimball is here to see you.
who?
detective donald kimball?
tell him i'm at lunch.
patrick, i think he knows you're here. it's only ten-thirty.
listen, john, i've got to go. t boone pickens just walked in...  just joking...  no don't tip the owner of the salon. okay, john, right, got it.  sorry about that.
no, i'm sorry. i should've made an appointment.  was that anything important?
oh that? just mulling over business problems. examining opportunities...exchanging rumors... spreading gossip.
hi. i'm donald kimball
hi. pat bateman. nice to meet you.
i'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but i was supposed to talk to luis carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, you're here, so...i know how busy you guys can get.
so, what's the topic of discussion?
i've been hired by meredith powell to investigate the disappearance of paul owen.
you're not with the fbi or anything, are you?
nothing like that. i'm just a private investigator.
ah, i see...yes. paul's disappearance...yes.
so it's nothing that official. i just have some basic questions. about paul owen. about yourself-
coffee?
no. i'm okay.
perrier? san pellegrino?
no, i'm okay.
patrick?
can you bring mr...
kimball.
mr. kimball a bottle of san pelle-
oh no, i'm okay.
it's no problem
well, what's the topic of discussion?
the disappearance of paul owen.
oh right. well, i haven't heard anything about the disappearance or anything...  not on "page six" at least.
i think his family wants this kept quiet.
understandable.  lime?
no, really. i'm okay.
you sure? i can always get you a lime.
just some preliminary questions that i need for my own files, okay?
shoot.
how old are you?
twenty-six. i'll be twenty-seven in october.
where did you go to school?
harvard. the harvard business school.
your address?
fifty-five west eighty-first street. the american gardens building.
nice. very nice.
thanks.
pardon me, but are you okay?
who do you ask?
you seem...nervous.
bad habit.
i know. i'm sorry.
would you rather i not smoke?
no, i guess it's okay.
you sure?
no problem.
yes, patrick?
bring us an ashtray for mr. kimball, please. she whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
what can you tell me about paul owen?
well...
how well did you know him?
i'm...at a loss. he was part of that whole...yale thing, you know.
yale thing?
yeah...yale thing.
what do you mean...yale thing?
so...there's nothing you can tell me about paul owen?
he led what i suppose was an orderly life. he... ate a balanced diet.
what kind of man was he? besides...  the information you've just given.
i hope i'm not being cross-examined here.
do you feel that way?
no. not really.
where did paul hang out?
hang...out?
yeah. you know...hang out.
let me think. the newport. harry's. fluties. endochine. nell's. comell club. the new york yacht club. the regular places.
he had a yacht?
no, he just hung out there.
and where did he go to school?
don't you know this?
i just wanted to know if you know. bateman before yale? if i remember correctly, saint paul's... listen, i just...i just want to help.
anything else you can tell me about owen?
we were both seven in 1969.
so was i.
do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?
well, there's a message on his answering machine saying he went to london.
well, maybe he did, huh?
his girlfriend doesn't think so.
but...has anyone seen him in london?
actually, yes.
hmmm.
well, i've had a hard time getting an actual verification. a stephen hughes says he saw him at a restaurant there, but i checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a hubert ainsworth for paul, so...
oh.
was he involved at all , do you think, in occultism or satan worship?
what?
i know it sounds like a lame question, but in new jersey i know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-i don't know if you've heard about this, but a young stockbroker was recently arrested and charged with murdering a young chicano girl and performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-
yikes! no. paul wasn't into that. he followed a balanced diet and-
yeah, i know, and was into that whole yale thing.
have you consulted a psychic?
no.
had his apartment been burglarized?
no, it actually hadn't. toiletries were missing. a suit was gone. so was some luggage. that's it.
i mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
no, not yet. as i said, we're not sure. but... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
that's so typical, isn't it?
it's just strange.  one day someone's walking around, going to work, alive, and then...
nothing.
people just...disappear.
the earth just opens up and swallows people.
eerie. really eerie.
you'll have to excuse me. i have a lunch meeting with cliff huxtable at four seasons in twenty minutes.
isn't the four seasons a little far uptown? i mean aren't you going to be late?
uh, no. there's one...down here.
oh really? i didn't know that.
listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
absolutely, i'm 100% with you.
great, and thanks for your, uh, time, mr. bateman.
i haven't seen you around here.
you just haven't been looking.
would you like to see my apartment?
do you want to come to my apartment or not?
i'm not supposed to.  but i can make an exception.
do you take american express?
you have a really nice place here...paul. how much did you pay for it?
actually, that's none of your business, christie, hut i can assure you it certainly wasn't cheap.
but laurie kennedy is a total hardbody. what do you think, bateman?
i know her. i knew her.
because he dated her.
how did you guess?
girls dig bateman. he's cq. you're total cq, bateman.
thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
do you know what ed gein said about women?
ed gein? maitre d' at canal bar?
no, serial killer, wisconsin in the fifties. he was an interesting guy.
listen, what about dinner?
is that all you ever have to contribute, van patten? "what about fucking dinner?"
what...is...it?
where are you going?
i've gotta...i've gotta...return some videotapes.
patrick?
what? carruthers  i'll call you.
will you call me before thanksgiving?
maybe.
what are you doing tonight?
dinner at the river cafe. au bar afterwards, maybe.
that's nice.
you and...luis?
we were supposed to have dinner at tad and maura's, but-you know how luis is...
i never knew you smoked.
you never noticed.
listen...patrick. can we talk?
you look marvelous. there's nothing to say. you're going to marry luis. next week, no less.
isn't that special?  patrick?
yes, courtney?
patrick?
yes?
nothing.
detective kendall...uh campbell? kimball kimball.  call me don.
don.
so...you hang out here a lot?
uh, yes...i mean...whenever necessary. you know.
how's the investigation going? taken anyone in for "formal questioning?"
0h no. informal conversations, mostly. what's that, stoli?
yeah. no finlandia, as usual. fucking dump.
too true. you know, bateman-people tend to reveal so much more about themselves when they're in a relaxed setting, don't you think?
i mean they want to get caught.
dan, great to see you again. like i said, you need anything at all, i'm your man. i don't envy your job. i mean owen was a...complex man.
yes, caron's right. gorbachev's not downstairs. he's at tunnel.
ask me a question.
so, what do you do?
what do you think i do?
a model? an actor?
no. flattering, but no.
well...
i m into, well, murders and executions mostly.
welt...it depends, why?
well, most guys i know who work in mergers and acquisitions don't really like it.
i'm leaving. i'm getting out.
leaving what?
this.
don't, i'll drink it.
listen to me, patrick. i'm leaving.
where to? are you going to go get a gram?
i'm leaving! i...am...leaving!
don't tell me...merchant banking?
no, you dumb son of a bitch. i'm serious. i'm disappearing.
where to? morgan stanley? rehab? what?
oh really? daisy he said...  he said you gave him bad vibes.
that's...that's too bad.
you think i'm dumb, don't you?
what?
you think i'm dumb. you think all models are dumb.
no. i really don't.
that's okay. i don't mind. there's something sweet about you.
jean?
yes, patrick?
would you like to accompany me to dinner?
that is...if you're not doing anything.
oh no. i have no plans.
well, isn't this a coincidence.
anywhere you want?
let's not think about what i want. how about anywhere you want.
oh patrick, i can't make this decision.
no, come on. anywhere you want.
oh, i can't.  i don't know.
come on. where do you want to go? anywhere you want. just say it. i can get us in anywhere.
soooo...dorsia is where jean wants to go...
oh, i don't know. no, we'll go anywhere you want.
dorsia is...fine.
dorsia, yes?
yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let's say at nine o'clock?
we are totally booked.
oh really? that's great.
i said we are totally booked.
two at nine? perfect.
there are no tables available tonight. the waiting list is also totally booked.
see you then.
yes? you're dressed...okay.
you didn't give them a name.
they know me.
jean? sorbet?
thanks, patrick. i'd love some.
want a bite?
i'm on a diet. but thank you.
you don't need to lose any weight. you're kidding, right? you look great. very fit.
you can always he thinner. look...better.
well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. i don't want to ruin your willpower.
no. it's all right. i'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
and don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay?
well, i'd like to travel. and maybe go back to school, but i really don't know...i'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but i'm so... i don't know...unsure.
do you have a boyfriend?
no, not really.
interesting.
are you seeing anyone? i mean, seriously?
maybe. i don't know not really. bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.
jean, do you feel...fulfilled? i mean, in your life?
well, i guess i do. for a long time i was too focused on my work, i think, but now i've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
growing. i'm glad you said that.
did you know that ted bundy's first dog, a collie, was named lassie? had you heard this?
who's ted bundy?
forget it.
what's that?
oh. uh, tape. duct tape. i...need it for... taping something. bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail gun.
patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
what...no! put it in the carton.
sorry.
jean? what?
make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
i'm looking for...i guess you could say i just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.
hmmmm.
yes. i don t think i can...control myself.
i know i should go. i know i have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...i mean, do you want me to go?
if you stay, i think something bad will happen. i think i might hurt you.  you don't want to get hurt, do you?
no. no, i guess not. i don't want to get bruised. you're right, i should go.
and don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with frederick bennet and charles rust at '21.
thanks. it slipped my mind completely.
i actually came to see timothy price, but he's taken a leave of absence.
yeah, gone into rehab. shame.  is he a suspect?
not really.
do you remember where you were on the night of paul's disappearance?  which was on the twentieth of december?
god...i guess...i was probably returning videotapes.
i had a date with a girl named veronica.
wait. that's not what i've got.
what?
that's not the information i've received.
well...i...wait...what information have you received?
let's see...  that you were with-
well, i could he wrong.
well...when was the last time you were with paul owen?
we had...gone to a new musical called...oh africa, brave africa. it was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. i think we had dinner at orso's. no, petaluma. no, orso's. the...last time i physically saw him was...at an automated teller. i can't remember which...just one that was near, um, nell's.
well, thank you, mr. bateman.
patrick, please. i hope i've been informative. long day-a bit scattered.
listen, i'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when i've sorted out all this information?
great, yes, i'd like that.
and if you could try and pin down where you were the night of owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier.
absolutely. i'm with you on that one.
never. i mean...i don't really like... singers.
not a big music fan, eh?
no, i like music. just-they're-huey's too... black sounding. for me.
well, to each his own. so-lunch, thursday? i'll call your secretary about reservations.
i'll be there.
i'm not so sure about this. i had to go to emergency after last time...
oh this won't be anything like last time, i promise.
i don't think so.
nothing like last time, promise.
alright.
so, you're looking great, how have you been?
well, i actually might need a little surgery after last time.
really?
my friend told me i should maybe even get a lawyer.
oh, lawyers are so complicated-don't do that. here.
this is nicer than your other apartment.
it's not that nice.
what do you mean, she was a hot number.
if you had an american express card she'd give you a blowjob.  listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need i say more?...what do you do?
she's my...cousin.
uh huh?
she's from...france.
elizabeth, it's three in the morning.
he's a goddamn drug dealer! these are his peak hours.
don't tell him you're here.
why would i?
this tastes weird.  harley? it's me. i need your services. translate that anyway you'd like. i'm at-
you're at paul owen s.
who?
paul owen.
i want the number, idiot.  anyway, i'm at paul norman's and i'll try you later and if i don't see you at canal bar tomorrow night i'm going to sic my hairdresser on you.
did you know that guy who disappeared? didn't he work at pierce & pierce, too? was he a friend of yours?
no.
do you have any coke? or halcyon? i'd take a halcyon.
listen, i would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. what's wrong with that? it's totally disease-free.
patrick, you re a lunatic.
come on. don't you find christie attractive?
let's not get lewd.  i'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
come on. i think it would be a turn-on.
does he do this all the time?
are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
no! i'm not a lesbian. why do you think i'd be into that?
well, you went to sarah lawrence for one thing.
those are sarah lawrence guys, patrick. you're making me feel weird.
did you know that whitney houston's debut lp called simply whitney houston had four number-one singles on it? did you know that, christie? whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
you actually listen to whitney houston? you actually have a whitney houston cd? more than one?
i want a firm commitment.
i think, evelyn, that we've...lost touch.
why? what's wrong?
my need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but i have no other way to fulfill my needs.
we need to talk.
talk about what, patrick? what is there to talk about?
it's over, evelyn. it's all over
touchy, touchy. i'm sorry i brought the wedding up. let's just avoid the issue, alright? now, are we having coffee?
i'm fucking serious. it's fucking over. us. this is no joke. i don't think we should see each other anymore.
but your friends are my friends. my friends are your friends. i don't think it would work.  you have a little something on your upper lip.
i know that your friends are my friends. i've thought about that. you can have them.
you're really serious, aren't you?
yes, i am.
but what about the past? our past?
we never really shared one.
you're inhuman.
i'm...in touch with humanity. evelyn, i'm sorry.  you're just not terribly important to me.
no, no, no.
i know my behavior is...erratic sometimes.
if you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now.
oh god, i can't believe this.
i'm leaving now. i've assessed the situation and i'm going.
where are you going?
i'm just leaving.
but where?
i have to return some videotapes.
no hash browns?
not in the mood, i guess.
but...everyone orders the hash browns here. i mean- it's-have you been here before?
yes, of course. the hash browns are delicious. i'm just...not... ordering them.
suit yourself, i guess.
so, the night he disappeared? any new thoughts on what you did?
i'm not really sure. i had a shower...and some sorbet?
i think maybe you've got your dates mixed up.
but how? where do you place paul that night?
according to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...marcus halberstam.
and?
i've questioned him.
marcus?
yes. and he denies it. though at first he couldn't be sure.
but marcus denied it?
yes.
well, does marcus have an alibi?
yes.
he does? you're sure?
i checked it out. it's clean.
oh. kimball now where were you?
where was marcus?
he wasn't with paul owen.
so who was he with?
he was at atlantis with craig mcdermott, frederick dibble, harry newman, george butner and   - you.
oh, right. of course...we had wanted paul owen to come. but he said he had plans...i guess i had dinner with victoria...the following night.
personally i think the guy went a little nutso. split town for a while. maybe he did go to london. sightseeing. drinking. whatever. anyway, i'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later.  i mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. isn't that right, patrick?
are you my two o'clock?
no.
can i help you?
i'm looking for...paul owen's...place.
doesn't he live here?
no, he doesn't.
are you sure?
you saw the ad in the times?
no. yes. i mean yes, i did. in the times. but... doesn't paul owen still live here?
there was no ad in the times.
i think you should go now.
but i think...i want to know what happened here.
don't make any trouble. please. i suggest you go.
don't come back.
i won't...don't worry.
patrick bateman's office.
jean? hello? jean?
patrick? is that you?
hello? jean, i need help!
where are you?
jean-i'm not-
craig mcdermott called. he wants to meet you and david van patten and tim price at harry's for drinks.
oh god, what did you say, you dumb bitch?
patrick? i can't hear you.
what are i doing?
where are you? patrick, what's wrong?
i don't think i'm gonna make it, jean.
...to the office this afternoon.
why?
just...say...no!
what is it, patrick? are you alright?
stop sounding so fucking sad! jesus!
excuse me, gentlemen. right back. he approaches carnes cautiously.
face it-the japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s.
jesus, davis. yes. that was hilarious. that was you, wasn't it?
yes, naturally.
bateman killing owen and the escort girls? oh that s fabulous. that's rich...
it was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
what exactly do you mean?
the message you left.
by the way davis, how is cynthia? you're still seeing her, right?
but wait, harold, what do you mean?
carnes? wait.
davis. i'm not one to bad-mouth anyone, your joke was amusing. but come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: bateman's such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that i couldn't fully appreciate it. i wasn't fooled for a second. now, if you'd said price, or mcdermott...otherwise, it was amusing. now, let's have lunch or dinner or something. hilarious, davis. a killer.
what are you talking about? bateman is what?
oh christ. he can barely pick up an escort girl, let alone...what was it you said he did to her?
now, if you'll excuse me, i really must...
wait. stop. you don't seem to understand. you're not really comprehending any of this. i killed him. i did it, carnes. i'm patrick bateman. i chopped owen's fucking head off. i tortured dozens of girls. the whole message i left on your machine was true.
excuse me. i really must he going.
no! listen, don't you know who i am? i'm not davis, i'm patrick bateman! i talk to you on the phone all the time! don't you recognize me? you're my lawyer.
now, carnes, listen to me. listen very, very carefully. i killed paul owen and i liked it. i can't make myself any clearer
but that's simply not possible. and i don't find this funny anymore.
it never was supposed to he! why isn't it possible?
it's just not.
why not, you stupid bastard?
because i had dinner with paul owen twice in london...just ten days ago.
no, you...didn't?
now, if you'll excuse me.
how can he lie like that? how can he pull that shit?
what shit? now where do we have reservations at? i mean i'm not really hungry, but i would like to have reservations somewhere.
i don't believe it. he looks so...normal. he seems so... out of it. so...undangerous.
i just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. how can you be so fucking, i don't know, cool about it?
some guys are just born cool, i guess.
and bateman, what are you so fucking zany about?
i'm just a happy camper. rockin' and a-rollin'. van patten  rehab's done wonders for you, pal. working for unicef now?
