here i come!
well bring yo' ass on...
what's the matter?
i fell in some mud.  now hurry up!
that nigga worst than them damn pit bulldogs or something!  that's why moving wit'cha uncle elroy and cousin day-day is the best thing for you right now.
ya'll making me look like a punk.
it ain't about being a punk, son.  it's about this...
must be your upper lip, 'cause i don't smell nothing.
i do.
what it smell like?
smells like you didn't fall in no mud.
i gotta get'em fixed.  they don't roll down.
all damn.
just hold your breath.
nice neighborhood, huh?
it's alright.
18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass brother hits the lotto his first time playing.  i still can't figure that one out.
why they got to have the loudest house on the block!
you coming in?
no, i'mma go on to work.  i don't wanna hear elroy's mouth.  now listen to me, craig.  it's gonna be different living over here.  don't let your uncle and your cousin get you into no shit.  understand?
hey, pops, i'm grown.  can't nobody get me in trouble no more.
what's crackin'?
you.  hi, uncle willie.
hey, debo, heard you running from a ass- whippin'?
naw, it ain't like that.
if you see that boy again, bite off his ear off like mike tyson.
alright, i'll remember that.
you know me?  i would've shot his big ass.  hey, willie, how's it going?  still steppin' in dog shit every day?
make sure you look after my son out here. don't get him involved with none of your bullshit, roy.
don't worry 'bout nothin', big bro.  he in the best fuckin' hands in rancho chocomunga, baby!  this my world, you just a nigga late paying rent.  ain't that right, nephew?
craig, remember what i told you.
i'll remember.
send betty my love.  boy you looking good.  i'mma take these in the house for you, man... and when you finish with this cat, come inside.  i got something to show you.
thanks, unc.
you know it's been over a year since we kicked it last?  up at the family reunion.
i know, that's when uncle elroy cussed out everybody, and threw up in aunt faye's backseat.
yep.  i forgot about him cussin' out everybody.  damn that was fun.
i know, we had a good time.  but ever since you guys moved out here, it seems like we've lost touch.
i know; this a long way from watts.  but what i like about living out here is that you don't hear no helicopters, no sirens, no drive-by's, no nothing.  just peace and quiet.  listen.
who is that?
joker, he just got out of the pen.  li'l joker, he just got out of youth authority.  and baby joker, he just got out of juvenile hall.
they ever let you hit the switches on that cadillac?
naw, them dudes is assholes.  especially that dog - cheeco.  watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  plus, i got something better than a cadillac.
this you?
yeah, that's me.  just a little somethin' somethin' i picked up.
must be nice.  i wish we won the lottery. come up on a million dollars like ya'll.
man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying off my daddy's bad credit, we didn't end up with a million.  we bought this house and i spent the rest on this.  it's the bomb, huh?
this my baby.  i feel like a new nigga in this car.  i get mo' phone numbers rollin' this, than i ever did on the bus.
my name is miss ho kym.  day-day just trying to be a smart ass.  nice to meet you, craig.  are you 'bout it, 'bout it?
excuse me?
i said...are you 'bout it, 'bout it -- rowdy, rowdy?
yeah, i'm 'bout it.
well, then, it's all good.  yo, day-day, something is going down with those mexicans across the street?  i've been seeing a lot of activity.
what kind of activity?
strange activity.  i think they running drugs off tijuana.  day-day don't believe me.
see you later, day-day.  come by after work, i got the john blaze shit for you.
nice to meet you?
peace out, craig.
man, this a cool house.
thanks, i just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
go on and make yourself at home.  i'mma go get dressed for work.
oh, yeah, where you work at?
pinky's records and disc in the shopping center.  i'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'cause you been unemployed for a long time now, craig.
thanks for reminding me.
craig, i want you to meet my old lady, suga.  suga, this is craig.
oooh, ba-by!
okay, okay, that's enough.  go put on some damn clothes.
elroy.
suga.  go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
okay.  bye, craig.
man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. viagra ain't working.  my back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  but check this out.  i got to lay some ground rules.  your my family and i love you.  you're welcome to anything you want in my home. but i don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
yeah.
well, let me in.
uncle elroy, who's that girl by day-day's car?
i can't see!  i can't see!  daddy!
lay down, day-day.  stop moving.
she pepper-sprayed me, man!  she pepper- sprayed me!
i know, be still.
wet your eyes, boy.  stay in there for about 20 minutes.
20 minutes?
yeah, 20 minutes.  trust me.  i've been pepper sprayed nine times.  20 minutes.
yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, craig.  i never thought i'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  but as soon as i got my check, i was gone.  paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
you paid cash?
cash money.  they wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan.  that's for suckas.  they got my daddy like that for a cadillac years ago.  i got the only house on the block that's paid for. that's why i'm the king around here.
it's cool, but where's the water?
don't need water.  we didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
y'all never use it?
never...  but me and suga can get real nasty in that jacuzzi, though.
that's okay, unc.  i can't swim, either.
good.
where did craig move to?
i don't know, debo.
what you say?
he moved out to rancho cucamonga with his cousin day-day.
rancho cucamonga?
yeah.
get on.
man, we can't ride to rancho cucamonga on that.
get on!
you straight?
yeah, i'm alright.  is my face still orange to you?
just a little.
i can't taste nothing.
what's the matter with your girlfriend?
man, it's a long story.  i met d'wana three months ago.  she had a little pudge in her stomach but i didn't pay it no attention.  come to find out, she six months pregnant.  saying i'm the daddy!
what?
yeah, i broke up with her two fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. she don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
restraining order?  where the hell you meet this girl?
i went back to watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  worst day of my life.
damn, you got a stalker.
that ain't the worst part.  her little sister, baby d.  she's the one that gets real physical.  but i got a restraining order on her, too.
you got a restraining order on a little girl named baby d?
you don't know baby d.
who is that?
that's the sister.
yo know what?  i'm starting to like rancho cucamonga.
i know what 'cha thinking.  i thought the same thing.  but it can't happen.
why?
because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  and i'm just trying to keep the peace.  we moved out here to get away from that shit.
karla.
craig and karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  where you going?
to the cucamonga shopping center.
oh yeah, why you walking?
my brothers won't give me a ride.
you want us to give you a ride?
i don't know.
what you mean, you don't know?  just wait here.
so.
what you mean, so?
if you 'get into it' with them s.a.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home.  i gotta live here.  just remember that.
i know you smoke weed, right?
why you say that?
'cause your lips is getting black.
negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
i don't know!
suga!
huh?
what you doing to my nephew?
ah, baby...i thought this was you.  craig, what are you doing to me?
i don't know, i think i passed out or something.  i don't remember.
passed out?  can't hang, huh?  boy, i knew you was a lightweight.  passed out on one funky ass blunt.  they don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
mr. nasty time?
mr. nasty time.  but take it easy on me, girl.
craig, you ain't the only lightweight around here.
delivery!
hold on.
delivery!
i said hold on!
could you hurry up, please... it's kinda hot out here.
can i help you?
nice house. didn't expect you to answer. you must be one of those entertainers. what team you play for?
i don't play for no team.
come on, jerky, you can tell me.  got a white wife, huh?  blonde bombshell type. remember what happen to o.j... what team do you play for?  you're not related to the jacksons, are you?
naw, i play for the chocamunga cracker killers.  you want tickets?
okay, buddy.  don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me.  it's just a certified mail delivery.
what is it?
delinquent property tax notice... i hope the cracker killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go.  wife stays here, of course.
here's the plan.  you gonna call over there and say you have a very urgent message for mr. william jones.
what urgent message?
if you shut up i'll tell you.  the urgent message is...drop everything!  craig is in trouble.  come quick, don't call.
that ain't gonna work.
just do it.
i don't know the number.
william.
yeah, i got a urgent message for a customer named william jones.  drop everything, craig is in trouble.  come quick.  don't try to call.
you too big.
keep pushing.

i feel you.  i've just been practicing that one move all week.  i thought that was it.
i can't get jiggy with this shit.  where is the damn manager?
sir, the manager stepped out for a moment.  i'm currently running the store. can i see the cd?
no, give me my damn money back.  right now, and i don't have no damn receipt neither.

you did all this for me?
most of it.  i just hate to see you in this situation.
thanks for noticing.  it used ta be peaceful before they got out.  took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
why didn't she put'em out?
easier said than done.  we saved up to get away from them, but they followed us.
i'm sorry to hear that.

nice to meet you?
peace out, craig.
man, this a cool house.
thanks, i just wish my mother had a chance to see it.
go on and make yourself at home.  i'mma go get dressed for work.
oh, yeah, where you work at?
pinky's records and disc in the shopping center.  i'mma talk to my boss and see if he got a little position for you.  'cause you been unemployed for a long time now, craig.
thanks for reminding me.
craig, i want you to meet my old lady, suga.  suga, this is craig.
oooh, ba-by!
okay, okay, that's enough.  go put on some damn clothes.
elroy.
suga.  go ahead and get us something to smoke on.
okay.  bye, craig.
man, that girl's gonna kill me one day. viagra ain't working.  my back keep going out... she don't never get enough.  but check this out.  i got to lay some ground rules.  your my family and i love you.  you're welcome to anything you want in my home. but i don't wanna catch you in the refrigerator or in my suga bowl... you feel me knocking?
yeah.
well, let me in.
uncle elroy, who's that girl by day-day's car?
i can't see!  i can't see!  daddy!
lay down, day-day.  stop moving.
she pepper-sprayed me, man!  she pepper- sprayed me!
i know, be still.
wet your eyes, boy.  stay in there for about 20 minutes.
20 minutes?
yeah, 20 minutes.  trust me.  i've been pepper sprayed nine times.  20 minutes.
yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, craig.  i never thought i'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  but as soon as i got my check, i was gone.  paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
you paid cash?
cash money.  they wasn't gonna stick me with no 30-year payment plan.  that's for suckas.  they got my daddy like that for a cadillac years ago.  i got the only house on the block that's paid for. that's why i'm the king around here.
it's cool, but where's the water?
don't need water.  we didn't have no pool in the projects...so none of us swim.
y'all never use it?
never...  but me and suga can get real nasty in that jacuzzi, though.
that's okay, unc.  i can't swim, either.
good.
where did craig move to?
i don't know, debo.
what you say?
he moved out to rancho cucamonga with his cousin day-day.
rancho cucamonga?
yeah.
get on.
man, we can't ride to rancho cucamonga on that.
get on!
you straight?
yeah, i'm alright.  is my face still orange to you?
just a little.
i can't taste nothing.
what's the matter with your girlfriend?
man, it's a long story.  i met d'wana three months ago.  she had a little pudge in her stomach but i didn't pay it no attention.  come to find out, she six months pregnant.  saying i'm the daddy!
what?
yeah, i broke up with her two fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. she don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
restraining order?  where the hell you meet this girl?
i went back to watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  worst day of my life.
damn, you got a stalker.
that ain't the worst part.  her little sister, baby d.  she's the one that gets real physical.  but i got a restraining order on her, too.
you got a restraining order on a little girl named baby d?
you don't know baby d.
who is that?
that's the sister.
yo know what?  i'm starting to like rancho cucamonga.
i know what 'cha thinking.  i thought the same thing.  but it can't happen.
why?
because, it's been a little tension between us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy.  and i'm just trying to keep the peace.  we moved out here to get away from that shit.
karla.
craig and karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  where you going?
to the cucamonga shopping center.
oh yeah, why you walking?
my brothers won't give me a ride.
you want us to give you a ride?
i don't know.
what you mean, you don't know?  just wait here.
so.
what you mean, so?
if you 'get into it' with them s.a.'s and start a feud, you can always go back to home.  i gotta live here.  just remember that.
i know you smoke weed, right?
why you say that?
'cause your lips is getting black.
negro, what the hell you doing to my woman?
i don't know!
suga!
