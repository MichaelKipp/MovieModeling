which one is it?
it is the last house on the left. she lives downstairs.
what are you going to do?
maybe this was not such a good idea.
so what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
cool it, andy.
i did not mean it the way it sounded...
i appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
okay, we won't.  we will just have fun, all agreed?
dammit shelly!  why do you always have to be such an asshole!
i beg your pardon, I am not an asshole.  I am an actor.
same thing.
look shelly, you are my roommate and i like you... most of the time.  but you got to stop doing these things.  now, i set this date up for you, did not i?  so do not embarrass me.  when you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
what are they saying?
i do not know.  i flunked spanish.
hi.
you are shelly?
I am sorry.
what d'ya got in there?
my whole world.
in that little thing?
stick around and you will see.
what are we gonna do?
destroy the evidence, pronto!
destroy the evidence?  no, man!
yes, man!
breakfast?
no way.  we are pregnant.  remember?
faster!  eat faster!
why do not you help us?
uh... i guess I am just not hungry.
I am going to be sicker than all of you, man.  now i got to spend the whole weekend totally straight...  i do not think i can make it, man!
chuck... look.
I am a slow eater.
i love you, man!
that scarecrow?  can not you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
come on, shelly.  who else is gonna give him a lift?
not us!  he is really creepy.
my name is abel.  and i am my brother's keeper.
where are you going?
going?  how do you mean?
i mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
drop me off?  how do you mean?
what is that?
i found this today.  there were other pieces of the body lying there, but i believe "he" wanted me to have this...
that is an eyeball!  oh, god!
"he" wanted me to warn you.  look at this, all of you!
come on down!
you go ahead...
derek... stop.
why?
you know what I have been through. do not ever scare me like that.
I am sorry.  i just wanted to surprise you.  what can i say?
you can say... "hello, how are you?"... for starters.
hello.  how are you?
you have not changed a bit.  always so sure of yourself.  even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
is that so bad?
i do not know.
you are irresistible.  i lose control.
just slow down.  let me get to know you again.  let me get to know this place again.
okay.  there is a whole weekend ahead of us.  there is time.
this door was open just a minute ago, was not it?
what?
nothing.
it is dark down there.
that is the way it is, man. cellars are dark.
and hell is hot, but i am not goin' down there either.
what is this?
your bed.
a hammock?
have you ever made love in a hammock?
look what i found.  remember these?
did you stay here last night?
no.  i got here just before you did.
somebody was in here.
goldilocks and the three bears?
I am serious.  does not this look a little strange to you?
no more... i can't!
yes, you can.  come on, shelly!
what was that?
where is shelly?
shelly!  where are you?!
are you all right, shelly?
let's spread out and check all the rooms.  outside, too.  you stay with me.
no.  i can look around by myself. I will take the upstairs.
is... is everything all right?
everything's going to be fine.
excuse me, but i believe that is mine...
please... be cool.
may be please have the wallet.
are they following us?
yes.
gulp!
see anything?
just a dirty window.  next time, I will know how to handle a situation like that.  let's just hope that "next time" is not too soon.
stop worrying.  i do not think they will bother to come after us.
i do not see anything.
keep looking.
got any good ideas?
maybe.
this is no time to celebrate!
just keep your eyes on the road.
what are you doing?
no time to explain.  just listen. when i yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  okay?
you are the boss.
bullseye!
stop the car!  now!!
this has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
look at it this way... things can only get better... right?
maybe we should do some exercise.
this is all the exercise i need...
we had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but shelly made them see the error of their ways.
it was nothing.
we are really sorry, but it was not our fault.
a few minor repairs and it will be as good as new.
this is too painful to look at.
why do not we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  it will mellow you out.
why do not we go take a swim?
i do not know...
we would be all alone.  we could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
sounds disgusting.  let's go.
what are you doing?
we have not looked in the barn, yet.  let's take a look.
not now.  I am cold.
how about a roll in the hay?
you can play with yourself, 'cause I am going in the house.
who brought up this bright idea?
we were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  it was either this or an orgy.  vera chose this.  what are ya going to do?
how about you and i whacking a couple of balls around?
if you insist.
you know, I am not sure i could live anywhere else.  the nights are always so peaceful and quiet.
it is deceiving.
what do you mean?
the quiet can fool you.  it fooled me.  you can never be sure of what is out there.
why did you come back here?
... to prove something to myself... to prove I am stronger than i think i am.
and, what about us?
I am here with you.  can not that be enough for now?
i do not know.  i do not see you for months on end, and when i do, you put this wall between us.  how do i break through?
I am trying.  I am really trying.
what happened that night?
you promised you would never ask me.
after you left me that night, i did not see you or talk to you again for a year.  no one would tell me anything.  all i know is what the police told me.  we have nowhere to go unless you let me in.  what happened?
... one thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... what is the world's record for this?
according to the guinness book, you passed the world's record several whacks ago.
i did?!  i broke the world's record.
you are all just jealous.
actually, i have no idea what the world's record is.  i was just kidding.
vera... you and i have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  i like you... very much.  i was thinking that maybe.
do not say any more.
how do we do it?
first we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or i get on top of you...
i know how to do it.  i mean, how do we do it in the hammock?
think you can figure it out?
I will think of something.
when you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  my parents were waiting up for me. as soon as i got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  i was so upset... i told them i slept with you.  my mothers slapped me.  that was the first time she would ever hit me.  i could not believe it.  i ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as i could run. i was crying.  they had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and i wanted to punish them for that.  i decided to hide out all night.  they would be so worried that they would be sorry for what they did to me.  the woods were cold and damp from the rain.  i found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and i guess i fell asleep.  all i can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  i thought it was my father so i hid behind the tree. but the footsteps just stopped. the woods were dark.  i could not see anything.  i heard a cracking noise behind me.  i turned around and... and... oh, god... there was this hideous looking man.  so grotesque he was almost inhuman.  he had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  i was so hysterical and i do not know how i was able to get away.  i ran and ran, but he kept coming.  he was big but so fast.  he caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. i was screaming, but who could hear me?  then... oh, god... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  i was kicking and yelling.  he dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  oh, please... please...
it is all right, you are all right. I am with you.
you have just learned a valuable lesson.  a beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
damn you, shelly!
why do you do these stupid things?!
i have to.
you do not "have to."
i just want you to like me.
i do like you.  but not when you act like a jerk.
being a jerk is better than being nothing.
i never said you were "nothing".
you do not to say it.  i can tell.
you are wrong.
that was the best yet.  was it you... me... or the hammock?
i vote for me.
i vote for the hammock.
what are you doin'?
i think it is called "a shower". you might try it sometime.
you are too clean for me.
hey deb... can you hear me?
barely.
I am going downstairs to get a beer. you want one?
what?
do you want a beer or not?
sure.
could we move a little faster?
sure, just watch where you are going.
you know him?
sort of.
i can not find the bong anywhere. can not you remember where you dropped it?
i can not even remember what day it is, man.
it is friday the 13th.
what is the matter?!
nothin'.  i was just foolin' around.
do not do that to me!
here.  go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
will you come with me?
be a man, man.
