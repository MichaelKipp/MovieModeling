do you see them yet?
patience my love, patience.
that's a virtue isn't it?
wait, i think i have them sighted.  what's the word, frank?
gabe?  gabe, where are you?
just hangin' out.
oh, my god!  i can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar.
don't say that.  you'll embarrass frank.
hal's signalling he's ok.
they're about two hundred yards from the top of the tower, right where that ledge comes out, gabe.
he knows it well.
the ledge, i know it well, or should i say <u>we</u> know it well.
you can stop right there.
we spent a night there one night...
enough.
yeah, we were caught in a storm. i went up there an innocent climber...
oh, please.
and when i came down, my morals were corrupted forever.
don't believe it...  you know the trouble with you is you have no brain filter. everything you think just pours right out.
room service...hi, sarah.
hi, gabe.
glad you could drop in.
hey, anything for a friend. how's the knee?
i think it's out.  no big deal. it's that old football injury.
funny, he told me he twisted it gettin' out of a hot tub.
i love you, too.
rescue one -- have located helpless climber, please prepare <u>idiot line</u> for transport, over.
wait 'til you get into trouble, just wait.
how're ya feeling?
fine, i guess...
sarah, we could take off and leave this guy behind...
rescue one -- please be advised ranger walker is making advances toward my girlfriend that are liable to get his ass kicked right into space, over.
copy.  hal, tell gabe he only makes advances <u>to me</u> or else he'll be walking down four thousand feet, and sleeping outside.
she's tough.
is it really four thousand?
remember, keep your arms and legs within the vehicle at all times--
hey, fuck you.
sarah, tonight why don't you and hal come over for dinner?
okay--i don't know about this.
the winds are picking up.
on my way.  alright sarah, are you ready for the best ride in the park?
please, can i think about this for a minute...okay, i'm sorry, it's fine.  what do you want me to do?
just keep lookin' at me and only think about the distance <u>across</u>. count it as you go:  one, two...by eight you'll be there.
can i count as fast as i like?
sure you can.
i'm sorry for all the trouble... thank you.
there you go.
one...
two...
that's it, you look like a professional.
three...
four...five...
nice and easy...
six...
i'm coming out!
no, stay off the line!  you'll break her loose!
the clip's not gonna hold!
go after her.
hold on, baby, he'll get you.
she's losing it!
sarah, hold on, he'll have you in a second.  jesus christ, grab her!
please -- oh, no -- please!
i'm here!  sarah, i'm here!  i'm here--i've got you!
use your other hand!  grab it!
help me!  i don't want to die!
you're not gonna die.  grab me with your other hand!
rich...
good morning, walt.
i'd like to have a word with you. this is agent matheson, fbi.
richard travers.
matheson has been transferred from the denver office to frisco. as a professional courtesy between offices, i was asked if he could hitch a ride.
we've got a full crew, but we can squeeze one more, right.
appreciate it.
you're the boss.  let's head out to the tarmac.  matheson, have you been totally briefed?
i don't know about totally.
who the hell ever is.  this is the most protected shipment we've got-- and the most useless. these bills aren't even <u>in</u> circulation; the one thousand dollar bills we're transporting are only used for international banking exchange.
do you always transport through the air?
mostly.  armored cars can be hijacked.  trains can be derailed.  but nobody can get to us in flight.
i haven't lost a bill in eighteen years, don't jinx me, walt.
i think treasury personnel are the most superstitious people in the federal government.
we should be.  everybody wants what we have.
gabe!  hey, man!  gabe!  it's gabe!
how yo doin', gabe!
work!  don't say that word, man.
man, i hate work even when somebody else does it!
hey, gabe, we're flyin' off the tower today.  c'mon with us.
c'mon, man--it's perfect weather for a monster, full-fledged gutrush!
hello, gabriel.
when you call me gabriel, i know i've got trouble.
where've you been?
working...i'm trying to figure out where to start.
maybe i can help. let's see... if one night i got up and packed up all my things and drove away without leaving so much as a note, and stayed away for months, i think what i'd want to do is come up with a well thought-out reason.
after the funeral i just had to leave.
had to leave?  believe me, we all wanted to leave...but you know what?  we stayed.
a lot of things fell apart up there.
i know...
i don't think you do.
why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
did i?  i don't know.  maybe i shouldn't have gone out on that line.  maybe i panicked.
i was there, you were the only one who didn't panic.  so do everyone a favor, don't hog all the guilt.  you held on as long as you could.  yes, everything did go wrong, starting with hal. i mean, what was he doing up on the tower with a girl who could barely climb?
i can't blame anything on hal. it was me.  i play it back in my mind everyday.
then turn it off, gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
i don't expect you to understand.
i don't understand?
you couldn't.
you're saying, i don't understand?  i'm the <u>only</u> one who does understand.  i'm the one you lived with for two years, i'm the one you made promises to, i'm the one who spent too many nights looking up at these rocks and wondering if you were ever going to make it down in once piece or ever at all.  believe me, there's been times i didn't know what i wanted to do more, love you or hate you.  but the one thing in our relationship that i did know and still do know is that i <u>understand you</u>.
why are you yelling?
excuse me?
why are you yelling?
did i miss something?
y'know, yelling at this altitude can lead to hyperventilation and fainting--
i'm not going to faint, but if i want to faint, i'll faint, okay?
okay, but if you do i'll have to perform resuscitation--
resuscitation?
--mouth-to-mouth, which could maybe...
which could maybe what?
maybe lead to a flare up...
a flare up...
flare up of old emotions...
listen to you...  the old "mouth-to-mouth" resuscitation routine, huh?
from one professional to another, of course.
course maybe you don't have to wait until i faint.
no, i think i will, it's safer. i have patience.
gabe, did you come back to stay?  you didn't.
i can't.  not here.  if you want, i'd like you to come with me...somewhere else.
where?
it doesn't matter, anywhere but here.
you come back after being gone almost a year, and you expect me to just leave...  this was <u>our</u> home, now it's <u>my</u> home.  i can't leave.  you can stay with me, and believe me, i want you to, but to just take off for the wrong reasons, i can't do it.  and you shouldn't either.
like i said, i can't turn it off.
and i can't leave.
if it's alright, i'm gonna pick up the rest of my gear.
you know where everything is...  i'm late for my shift.
jess--you look good.
what the hell are you doing--
now i have jurisdiction!  i said get your weapons.
these are highly trained agents overreacting without just cause.
calm down...give the gun to me. you're out of control, son.
what the hell are you waiting for, goddammit!  don't you see what he's doing!  he's hijacking the shipment!
travers!  hurry it up.
on my way.  the cases are hooked up and ready.
why didn't you send the money over?
somehow i didn't think you'd wait for me if i'd sent it first.
what's the delay?
let's move your ass in there!!
did you catch that thunder?
no way, death-breath, that was too intense for thunder.  c'mon let's rock an' roll.
kill me?  christ we're partners in this!
were.  give me the tracking monitor!
why?  what are you going to do?!
the monitor! i never ask twice.
hey, jessie, you're just in time for another masterpiece.
so, what do you see?
surprise me.
what usually eats a banana?
a monkey?
so...what are you, blind, son? this is a banana eating a monkey, nature in reverse.
y'know, jessie, doesn't frank look like a normal guy--but he's not,  are you frank?
got to be comb bluff.
acknowledge.  winds are too strong to get a chopper up there, are you near any natural shelter? over.
you and frank get the tents, thermal clothing, and medical supplies together.
who's going with you?
you're looking at him.
where's the rest of the team?
bob and rick are in denver.  i gotta get up there as fast as possible.  frank, get me a load of flares.
thank god you didn't leave.  we just got a mayday.  seven climbers stranded off comb bluff. the weather's pouring in fast and hal's gone up alone.
hal knows what he's doing.
if he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  he needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
he doesn't want my help.
that's not the issue here, those people are.  he can't do it alone.
he can handle it.
what if he can't?
i haven't climbed in months--you lose the feel.
you mean the nerve.
i know you don't want to be responsible for anybody's life anymore, but walk away and you are responsible.  please gabe, he went up the west ridge.  if you go up the south face, you can catch him, no problem--
can't do it.
can't do it?  i don't believe this.  don't you feel anything?
i only came back for you.
what the hell are you doing here?!
i was with jessie, she filled me in.
now let me fill you in.  you can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
when we get this group down, i'm gone.
you're gone now!  i don't climb with people i can't trust.  why'd you come up, to prove something?
i'm here for the same reason you are, so let's do it.
can't pass up another chance to play hero, can you.
look, i know--
you don't know anything. you did it your way and she died.
i did what i thought was right.
well you were wrong! it was your weight on the line that did it--
there wasn't time for anything else.
we'll never know, will we?
look, it was a bad time for everybody.
what the hell do you know about bad time.  you didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
and you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  now drop it!
no, buddy, it was you who dropped it!
if you want, do it.  i don't care.
where's the helicopter?
what the hell's going on?
that was the first and last question-- now only answers. where's the chopper?
it can't fly in this weather.
this is where your background in police work comes in handy--ask the questions, travers.
don't use my name!
ask the questions.
you're both with the mountain rescue team?
yeah...
anyone else following?
what's your names?
tucker and walker.
tucker and walker, we've lost three bags.
you know how the airlines are.
bags?
suits, underwear, 100 million dollars...the usual stuff. travers was smart enough to bring along a tracking device.  step into my office.
where's the third one, travers?
there, what's that place?
looks like the tower.  it's a bad climb.
a bad climb, no, just another challenge.  what's life without 'em, right, agent travers.
get off my back, qualen!
i haven't even got on it yet.  let's go, time to fetch.
the faster you find the bags, the bigger you boys' finder's fee will be.
right, all the bullets we can eat.
go on, fetch.
i need my bolt gun and an ice axe.
don't give him anything.
we agree on something.  and for insurance, take his coat.
he'll freeze.
ryan, get a rope, i want the man on a leash, too.
forget me.  if you can, get away.
would you?
what's he doing?
the best he can since you gave him nothing.
i don't trust him.
kill him when he gets down.
bring down the money or your friend's dead!
we can't and he knows it.
talk.  no tricks, no codes, no messages.  you haven't found us. it was a fake call.
jessie, i reached the top of the tower.  so far, no sign of anyone.  looks like a phoney call. over.
you gotta be kidding me!  do you want me to fly up after you? over.
<u>negative</u>.  the winds are too high.  i'm going to ride out the storm here.  i'll take shelter in the douglas exhibition shaft. over and out.
have her come up.
the down drafts would wipe her out.  it's the only chopper.  if it goes, you got no ride out.
he said the tower, but he's on comb bluff?  frank, fly me to the west valley, the winds are never too bad there and it's only a half hour climb to the douglas shaft.
i don't know.
if i don't meet up with them, you can come and pick me up by nightfall.
hal will have my head for this.
and it's such a handsome head. please frank, and i swear i'll buy one of your paintings.
i admit, i can be bought.
on top of the peak.
it looks like a winding route.
mr. travers is not the athletic type, he needs something more direct.
the only faster way up is the east face and it's smooth as glass.  maybe a dozen guys in the world could do it in good weather, only a psycho would try it in a storm.
jessie, jessie, copy?
i copy.
jessie, girl this is insane. weather stat called in wind gusts up to 50 knots for tonight.
if you can't make it back, i'll hold up at the douglas shaft. stop worryin'.  you sound like a mother hen.
rooster!  forget the hen stuff. be safe, honey.  over.
gabe!?
what are you doing here!?
looking for hal.  oh my god, i heard someone kick the door open...you came back.
how'd you get up here?
frank dropped me in the west valley and i hiked.  you look frozen.  what's happening?!
you got to go back now!
where's hal, what's going on?
before it crashed, they dumped three cases filled with millions. they're using hal for a bird dog. once they find the money, hal's dead.  so get on your radio, contact frank, have him pick you up, then contact the state police, the park police and anything else wearing a badge and tell them to get up here!  do it jessie.
i can't.  the radio's at the bottom of the shaft.  but frank'll be looking for me soon. when he gets here i'll contact everybody from the chopper.
that's no good. it'll be dark soon, there's no other shelter for ten miles. if they show, they'll take you too.  why'd you have to come up here?!
for the same reason you did, to help.
yeah, let's go.
man against nature, right travers.
what about it?
down there you buy a life, up here you earn it or die.  how's your health?
let's be creative.
excuse me?
this way.
then go fetch.
he's alive!
he can't be far away.  find him. go!
they've got to find shelter soon, and so do we.  how are you holding up?
you know me, i'm a night person.
take off and meet me at eagle cave.
what about you?
don't worry about me, just go.
"it's a perfect day for a monster jump."  hey man, can you like do me a favor?
what?
next time you're like watching mtv, y' know, like flip it to the weather channel for a split second and check it out.  i mean, hey, we could be home watching some righteous pornos.
that woulda been cool.
exactly, cheesehead, exactly.
answer the man.
nothing, just tourist souvenirs.
souvenirs?  no, wrong answer. looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
no, he's gone.
no, he's close, and he's using our money to keep you alive. nobody's worth that much on the open market.  except you, the loyal one.  didn't i tell you to warm the place up?
man, it costs a fortune to heat this place.
i'm glad you find humor in this.  do you know what people would do for that?
i can't believe you just said that.
neither can i.  what do you think they're doing now?
making things real rough for hal.
you still wear the cable necklace i gave you.
call me sentimental.
remember the first time we came up here?
of course i do.
it was great.
you attacked me.
can you think of something more romantic than attacked?
only kidding...<u>actually</u> i attacked you.
no, actually it was more like mutual attacking.
why can't things stay the way they are...everything has to change.  what we had was perfect.
i don't know.  here, lay down and get some rest.  we're going to need it.
gabe...your arm?
yeah?
if you're not using your arm, can i borrow it?
sure, just give it back when you're done.
jessie?  looks like your friend found company.
we're down to a few hours before the whole world shows up here.  where's the next one?
it's up there, on the tower.
how far?
he asked you, how far?!  i think you've been taking the scenic route.  how far from here?
half a day.
for christ's sake, they're kids.
we're not animals, but don't force us to be.  walk over.
you son of a bitch!  you said you wouldn't kill him!
sue me.
good, travers.  it might catch on, like shooting skeet.
you dumb bastard, you waited too long.  if he made it back, this place would have been covered with police in a few hours.  the way we're moving, it's going to be anyway.
murdering, motherfucker...
kill a few people, they call you a murderer.  when you kill millions, you're called a conqueror.  go figure.  move on tucker, time is short.
we have to get through to the other side.  you up for it?
i've gone this far, and right now i think i'm in better shape than you.
a simple yes or no would have done.
want me to lead?
cute.
you said there was a way across.
there is.
then where the fuck is!
there.  you blind?
this is insane.  the hell with the money.  you radio in for that chopper, understand!
hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. move.
nice view, huh?
breathtaking.
what was god thinking when he built this place?
if we don't get out of here soon we can ask him in person.
gabe!  are you alright?
no, not really.  throw down a rope.
can you see light?
up ahead.
gabe are you alright?
for the record, whenever you hear me sliding out of control, i'm never alright.  when i secure the line, come on up.
look here, the mountain man. you're walker, right?
good memory.  you must be great with numbers.
your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
i burned it.
what the fuck you mean you burned it?
never could save a thing.
now you get burned.
c-4?
more bang for the buck.
jessie, hal, come in...please report.  over.
where's the radio?
no luck?
next time, date only basketball players.
she's a lyin' bitch!!
get it!
they'll kill him!  he has no idea!
we gotta get out and fire a flare.  it's the only chance!
is it set?
primed to go off right over his head, officer.
we might be able to go that way.
forget it.  if that charge goes off before we can reach it, this whole damn crevice will slam shut on us.  this way.
why the hell are we wasting time here?!
insurance against him finding that last case ahead of us.
pull it apart!
what?
start pulling it apart!  we're climbing down on it.
this rope is sixty years old!
these old ropes can hold 900 lbs., each strand 300.  i'm 190, you're about 135 -- it just may hold.
never
never, what?!
i've never weighed 135 lbs.!
helluva time for vanity!
frank!  no, frank!  frank!
jess, c'mon...
gabe!
hold on!  hold on!  reach up!
reach up!  do it!
don't let me fall!
do it, goddammit!
thanks for holding on.
we were going together before i ever let go of you.
i'm holding you to that.  gabe, what about frank?
i don't know.  i don't know.
he never hurt anybody.
i'm touched.  kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
crockett river is where the last of the money fell.
if we go along the northern ridge, we can get there first.
there's no "we".  there's a me. all i have to do is make it along the north wall to bitker ladder. what you're doing is going back down to the station to get help. and don't put on that mad face.
forget it.  you're in no shape to climb alone. i stayed with you this far, and you didn't drop me, so i owe you. c'mon, let's go.  hurry up, time is money.
"time is money" -- please.
travers, you're not running things.
when he finds the money, you're as dead as me.
what's the code, travers?
i told you, 50,000 possible keycode combinations, in fifteen second intervals.
give me the fucking code!
my heart can't take much more of this.  look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
that's exactly what i want you to do.
what about you?
what do you think?  maybe i could reach the ledge without falling. no, forget it.
oh, good. for a minute i thought you'd lost your mind.
but maybe with a good start i can hit those hand-holds.
hand-holds?!  i can barely see them.
we don't have time to argue about it!
are you crazy?  has the altitude shrunk your brain, gabe?
take the rope.
i won't do it.  no way.
take the rope.
enough's enough.  how could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
wrap it around that rock twice.
i'm going to wrap it around your throat!
an' if i miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
forget it!  i refuse!
fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
don't lay any guilt on me. suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
just kidding.
gabe?  wait 'til i get over there.  tie the rope so i can come across.
can't do it.  now go back and get help!
ready to die quiet-like, asshole.
hey, let's get something straight. if i'm gonna die, i'm gonna die, but you're always gonna be the asshole, so just shoot, alright.
who's shooting?
did i hear somethin' break? outside left!
fuck you.
cursin'.  that's a penalty kick for unsportsmanlike conduct, mate.
you got what we need?
no, that son-of-a-bitch walker is alive.
no names, this is an open line!
i don't give a shit, qualen!  i had to be insane to ever tie up with a low-life, piece of shit like you.  they beat us.  a couple of fuckin' hick mountain boys beat the man no law agency ever could.
get off the radio!
thanks for staying around when you didn't have to.
my pleasure.
how's your leg? i'll live.  where'd you leave jessie?
near freedom falls.  she went for help.
hey, about everything that happened with sarah.  i know you did what you could--
tucker?
qualen, glad you stuck around. there should be a few hundred cops looking to meet you.
tucker, you know where the money is-- i want it.
qualen, go fuck yourself.  the game's over--you lost.
no, the goddamn game's not over! it's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
what are you talking about?
jessie!  are you alright?
i want the money--meet me at the highest point from where you are. don't do it and we're going to see if your angel here can fly. copy?
copy.  jessie, go to the top of bitker ladder.
love's a killer, isn't it?
what are we going to do?
give him the money.
i'm going with you.
not on that leg.
take the gun.
you keep it.  get up there if you can, and if you get a chance, do me a favor and kill him.
where are you, walker?
you're getting warmer!
throw it up or i'll kill her.
you do, and the spring thaw is going to be worth a lot of cash!
the money!
when she's safe!
what about you?!
run, dammit!!
oh, my god!
climb, gabe, climb!
the "old mouth to mouth" resuscitation routine.
there's a lot more where that came from.  you're not leaving again?
and miss all of this peace and quiet?  never, right hal?
right.
then it's a deal.
