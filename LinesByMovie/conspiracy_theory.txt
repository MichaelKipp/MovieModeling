the sound of love.
excuse me?
that is love.
love?  love's just a pretty way of saying, 'i want to sleep with you'.  love is bullshit.
i live on tips, so do not be offended, but you are a liar.  i saw you kiss.  admit it, this is the street where love lives.
love gives you wings.  it makes you fly.  i do not even call it love.  i call it geronimo.
geronimo?
geronimo.  when you are really in love, you will jump.  off the top of the empire state.  screaming 'geronimo' the whole way down.
but you will die.  you will squash yourself.  what is the point?
are not you listening, man?  love gives you wings.
she must be some girl.
i love her so bad.  she just... wrecks me.  i would die for her.
i never told her.
why the hell not?
i, uh, i have some problems.
are you crazy?!
the guy came right at us!
you turned up a one way street!
i was only going one way.
drop me off here!
look, I am sorry --
just drop me off.
what are you thinking, jerry?
water mains usually go in the winter.  it is august 1st.
tell you what.  reminds me of life in the delta.
mississippi?
mekong, my friend, mekong.
you know, flip, vietnam war was fought because of a bet howard hughes lost to aristotle onasis.
sure.  and the two of 'em used my legs for a wishbone.  nearly snapped me in half.
i gotta go, flip.  thanks.
ah, your psychotic is here.
not today...
tell him I am on vacation.  that i will not be back for two weeks.
i do not know if you are the best lawyer I have got or a high school sophomore.
i do not see the connection.
come on!  six major earthquakes in the last three years?  the space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
testing some top secret seismic weapon.
not testing.  using.  nukes are passe.  this is the weapon of the future.
i still do not see what it has to do with the president.
do you still ride?
not for years.
so why do you keep the picture up? you wish you had not quit?
well, i -- jerry, the point.  get there.  what does it have to do with the president?
the president's in europe. tomorrow he will be in turkey. right along this fault line.  they launched the space shuttle yesterday.
motive?
he is cutting funding for nasa. the milk cow of the aerospace industry.  we are talking billions. motive enough?
nasa is going to kill the president of the united states with an earthquake.
not exactly the kind of thing a secret service agent can throw himself on top of.
you going to warn him?
i can not promise you anything.
you think I am crazy.
i think you are different.
you know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow coca cola and eat kentucky fried chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy against yourself.  i can not lie to me, liza.  and the more i strip through the sham, the crazier i look to people like you. can not you see that is what they are counting on?  you want to go out sometime?
no.
i better get going.
you do not have to burst in here every time, jerry.  just call and make an appointment.
what was your horse's name?
johnny dancer.  you have been in my office ten times.  how come you never asked me about that picture before?
was waiting till i knew you better.  johnny dancer, huh? sounds like a racehorse.
do i know you?
yes you do, jerry.  quite well.
I am a very patient man.
that is great.  good for you.
who have you been talking to, jerry?  who else knows what you know?
could you be a little more specific?
what is that?
lysergic acid diethylamide... with a little kicker of my own.  surely it must be coming back to you by now?
so, you doing anything tonight?
working.
hmm, how about tomorrow night?
working.
night after that?
look, you are a nice guy, but I am not really dating right now.
I am not that good at 'no,' liza.
too bad.  because I am terrible at 'yes.'
i bit the bastard's nose off.
you bit someone is nose off?
yes!  do not let's get into this thing where i have to repeat myself!
it is a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches!  you have got to listen to me.
put down the gun and I will take your statement.  okay?
you are the boss.  just do not make me repeat myself.  i hate that.
what is the charge?
you were there, jerry.  figure it out.
just relax.
switch the charts.
what?
switch 'em.  or I will be dead by morning.  do not want to be dead.
I will see you tomorrow.
hey...  i can not control it.  it is just, something that happened.
what is?
love.
what happened?
guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  go figure.
they said send you downstairs.
who?
the f.b.i., the c.i.a.  you name the initials and they are down there.
any special reason?
all i know is, they said to send you and the body to the basement.
people do have heart attacks.
sure.  you switched the charts, did not you?
it is okay.  the guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store.  he had it coming.
you expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
you switched the charts; you tell me.
i got to get downstairs.  the c.i.a., they want to see your body.
really?
i will not be here when you get back, but I will be in touch.  and thanks.
for what?
you saved my life.
heart attacks happen.
we are waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up.  this guy fletcher's something else.
tell me about it.
while we walk.  d.c. police want him for assault. secret service for counterfeiting and we are tracking him on a string of bank robberies.  no one knows what the c.i.a. wants him for.
wait --
guy's a c.i.a. shrink.  here to i.d. fletcher.  they knew each other somehow.
you do not understand --
can i ask you something?
a dog bit it.
excuse me?
you were going to ask about my nose.  the poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
and you feel bad for it?
it was my dog.  let me ask you a question.  how long have you been acquainted with jerry?
he says a dog bit his nose.
arf... you gotta help me.
i can not promise you anything.
which way did he go?
i do not know.  did not see him.
so he thinks nasa is plotting to kill the president?
you already asked me that.  why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
and you have no idea where he lives?
you have asked me that one three times.
here's a fresh one.  why you? your colleague mr. wilson says jerry will not speak to anyone else. that seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
I am sorry.  what was the question again?
why you?
honestly?  i think he has a crush on me.
a charming term.  now, why him?
excuse me?
jerry's visits to your office. why do you tolerate them?  why him?
a year ago i was leaving work late one night.  two guys tried to mug me.  it was horrible.  jerry came out of nowhere.  to my rescue. then he started coming to see me.  could have been a storybook if he was not crazy.  at first i did my beat to avoid him.  but there is something inside jerry and...  jerry made me see it.  he made me see him.  that make sense?
veritas.  truth.  what is it they say about truth?
the truth shall make you free.
that is it.  i went to yale.  i hope you will not hold that against me.
only on the football field.
i did not know the c.i.a. had psychiatrists.
we are very specialized.
brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. making sure the men who have gone over the edge will not hurt anyone. that sort of thing.
that is the book hinkley had on him when he shot reagan.
i was just thinking that.
you are welcome!  spooks.  so, you want to compare notes on this guy.
no.  not yet.
lucky guess... um, I would feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
do not tell me you are naked back there.
figure of speech.  could we go?
what took so long?  you were in there all day.
that is how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  a lot of people are after you, jerry.
dead or alive, they will stick me in there with oswald.  another lunatic acting alone,
oswald was an assassin.  you are not an assassin, are you, jerry?
if you are worried about the president, call and warn him about the space shuttle.
right.  sit up so i can see you.
uh uh, do not want them to see me.
them who?
change lanes.  then watch your rearview.
flat, wraparound headlights?
yeah.
crown victoria.  f.b.i. car.  a legitimate tail.
as opposed to?
people more serious about their work. you know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
you mean i should speed up and try and lose them?
yes.
that is how a man would do it.  I am not a man.
i noticed.
agent lowry.
was not my idea.
jonas?
it is his show for now.  look, you want to get some dinner?  inter- agency cooperation and all?
when I am ready to compare notes, I will let you know.
your call.  have a good night.
see?  was not that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
nothing is easy.
how long have we known each other, jerry?
six months.  eleven days.
till today, i have not believed a word.  now, I am curious.  six months, eleven days.  I am going to give you one more hour to impress me.  where to?
jerry?  you did not show last night.  first time ever.  had me worried, boy.
sorry, flip.  got sidetracked.
saved you last night's, too.
flip was a hero in vietnam.
sure was.  pounded the v.c. for this greek cat named ari onasis.
you have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
yeah.  i think so.
nothing scary there.  sorry.
oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye.  hmm... ahh...  ooooo...
more about life on mars.  from a rock they found on the south pole. explain that one to me.  but maybe we should go to mars and find out? how much do you think that is going to cost?
what is it with you and the space program?
and look here.  cease fire in chechenia.  that is good for the banks who lent the government money, but bad for the guys selling them weapons.  listen to this, some gas company in colorado.  their researchers have been blocked from testing a fuel additive.  they have accused the e.p.a. of, quote, 'turning a blind eye to the future.'
well that is the eye right there. money.  and all the power and misery it brings with it. it is a plot to take over the world.  the master conspiracy. can take a lifetime to pull off.
do they have a secret handshake?
that is it?
i have no idea.
so why are they after you?
I am not sure.  i think i figured something out.  it must have been in my newsletter.
what newsletter?
so I am a little jumpy.  who would not be?
you are certifiable.
you would not be sitting here if you did not halfway believe me.
believe you about what?
you okay?
flesh wound.  no big deal.
you know why the grateful dead are always on tour?
surprise me.
the whole kit and caboodle of 'em are british intelligence agents. spies.  jerry garcia had a double- o rating.  just like james bond.
you want something to drink?
um, coffee.  if that is okay?
if my universe had a hub...
this would be it?
equitation.
I have been reading up on it.
are these yours?
here it is.  conspiracy theory  it just went out tuesday.  third issue this year.  i bet i struck a nerve.  pissed someone off.
'the space shuttle's seismic secret'.  'the oliver stone-george bush connection'.  oliver stone?
stone is their spokesman.  you think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they would let him do it?  stone's a disinformation flunky.  the face that he is alive says it all.
can you prove any of this?
absolutely not.  a good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy.  if you can figure it out, they screwed it up.
'on july 8, 1979, security forces under control of the trilateral commission abducted the fathers of all american nobel prize winners. the men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  the sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the rand corporation in santa monica, california.'
pretty scary, huh?
yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
just five.  it is the economy... you think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
you got a list?
you are a holden caulfield fan.
who?
holden caulfield?  catcher in the rye?
never heard of him.
you have ten copies of the book, but you do not know who the main character is?
I have never read it.  i just -- every time i see one i buy it.  i do not know why exactly... wanna hear my favorite part?
what are you doing?
getting rid of my hub!
was that who i thought it was?
uh huh.
has this happened to you before?
never, but I have been practicing.
who are you, jerry?
just a guy trying to put out a fire.
you gave me an hour; now give me a day.
jerry, there is something i have to ask you.  actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  to my satisfaction.
shoot.
it was that painting.  the one on the wall.
i did not mean for you to see it. it is like looking in someone is diary and taking it out of context.  know what i mean?
it made me feel like you could see inside of me.  and i do not know how that is possible.
so what is the question?
how is it possible?
I will give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.
is this your dad?
that was him.
is he dead?
please put it down.
how did he die?
he was murdered.
he is why you punish yourself.
not this again.
you run with your back to the picture.  like you were trying to get away.  once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
you watch me, do not you?
johnny dancer, right?  you do not ride him anymore, do you?  not since your dad died.
fuck you.  i know you are crazy, but fuck you.
thank you.
you are welcome.  where is my partner?
i like that.  a gun to your head and you ask about your partner. he is okay.  may have a headache for a few days.  are you here with honorable intentions?
I am not sure what you mean.
you should think of me as liza sutton's guardian angel.
that is ironic.  because we are here to protect her from you.
you are here because you figured i might show up.
it seemed like a possibility. what about your intentions?  are they honorable?
I am not a violent man, mr. lowry. not by nature, anyhow.  but if you hurt liza in any way, I will kill you.  does that seem honorable?
well, i do not know if --
I have been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to jerry fletcher.  we are not to discuss him with the press, the n.y.p.d., anyone.  building police are to arrest him on sight and we are to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
this does not make sense.
it makes perfect sense.  field work is not our oeuvre.
i do not like it.  something is wrong.
dr. jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate.  why is that?
we do not know who jonas is.  we do not know who it is we are cooperating with.
I have had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, liza.  what i saw yesterday, i know not to ask questions.  we are out.  shut off. terminated.  understood?
-- understood.
liza, settle a bet for us.
what do i look like to you? switzerland?
did you see the van back there?
what van?
never mind.  you would think i was making it up.
where did you get your subscribers?
i put an ad on a computer bulletin board.  i log on at the library so i can not be traced.
well, I have been tracking them down all morning.
you have not been bothering them, have you?
they are dead.  four out of five anyhow.  all in the last 24 hours. one car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
jesus... it is my fault.  they drew a black line over me and now I am passing it on.  I am passing it to you, too.
I will be fine.  let's worry about henry finch.  p.o. box in st. louis.  he is the last on the list. i have not been able to reach him yet.
maybe you better not try... i worked so hard to keep quiet. like a mouse.  i should have realized.
realized what?
henry finch.  that they monitor everything.  that it was only a matter of time.  and now four people are dead.
elaborate on 'they,' okay?
there are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials.  but they are all part of two warring factions. one:  families that have held wealth for centuries. they want one thing.  stability. group two:  the boat rockers. eisenhower's military industrial complex.  they want instability. it is a trillion dollar a year business.  when there is not a hot war, they make a cold one.
cold war's over, jerry.
so now they feed us terrorists. to create fear.  how much do you think an airport security system goes for?  then multiply it by every airport in the country.
and you think group one is at war with group two.
latest casualty?  ernest harriman. you heard of him?
sure. one of the richest men in america until he died a few days ago.
his obituary was in every paper. but not one of them said he was murdered.
murdered?
right here in manhattan.
it said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  in newport.
nobody dies in newport.  they could not even kill sunny von bulow there.  harriman drowned, but it was not in newport.
where then?
right here.  in the 7th street subway station.
what was he doing down here?  a billionaire waiting for the subway?  why not drown him in a bus?  why drown him at all?  why not shoot him?  is the hitman from the lost world of atlantis?  i mean, come on.
i see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
they are big details, jerry.
do you watch the news?  read the paper.  last week, this whole place was underwater.
a water main broke.
they do not break in the summer! do you know what building is right over this spot?  harriman tower. their sub-basement was flooded! he did not die in a pool.  call the coroner in rhode island!  ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
okay, i will.
you will?
if that is what you want.  yes.
i do not know what to say.  i love you.
what?
i -- it is like, i resolve to call you up 1000 times a day.  to ask you if you will marry me in some old-fashioned way.  everything you do is magic.
those are song lyrics, jerry.
i know that.  I am just -- I am nervous.  i reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. i know they are song lyrics.  and i know how i feel.
i like you, jerry.  a lot.
oh, christ, here it comes.  look, i know you think I am crazy.  i do not think i am, but...
jerry, i --
what if i reached a point where you did not think i was crazy anymore?  if i was normal.
if you were eating kentucky fried chicken and drinking coca-cola again.
yeah...  would you, i mean, could you love me then?  if i was normal.  maybe?
do not do this to yourself.  jerry. you do not love me.
you are wrong.  since i met you, i do not dream about holes anymore.
holes?  i do not know what you are talking about.
yesterday you were wondering about the wall.  how it was possible.
now's not really the time to get into this --
it is geronimo.  love. it lets you see things.  it gives you insight. I have loved you since the first time i saw you.
answer me.  was the first time you saw me the first time i saw you? was it?  you have been following me around.  do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  that is not love, jerry.  it is obsession. and it is not normal and you can not expect me to respond to it and you can not expect me to feel the same way.  can you?
i would never hurt you, liza. think whatever you want, but do not think that.
i don't.  i know you wouldn't.
i thought you -- why -- love ruins everything, does not it?
if you are as impressed to see me as i am to see you, you are very impressed indeed.  how is jerry feeling this morning?
fine.  what the hell is going on?
please, sit.
what I am about to tell you is partially documented.  the freedom of information act saw to that. but much more of it isn't.  for reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I am going to share -- secrets -- with you. repeat any of it and you will simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
truth'll set you free.  I am listening.
years ago, i worked for the c.i.a. in the m.k. ultra program.  are you familiar with it?
it was mind control.  manchurian candidate kind of stuff, right?
a vulgar pop term, but yes.  take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin.  that was our goal.
ask what you can do for your country.  that kind of thing.
m.k. ultra was terminated in 1973. but not the research. it was renamed.  ex catcher.
as in catcher in the rye?
i am impressed.  we used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card.
we experimented with hallucinogens.  we used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state.  we conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
terminal?
as in 'resulting in death.'  we pushed the envelope until it was not even an envelope anymore.
if i had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I would arrest you right here.
me?  i was a minor missionary, a heretic really.  but where else could a red-blooded american boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the all-highs?  besides, now I am trying to pay my penance.
missionary?  penance?  you talk about it like it was a religion.
it was.  it was.
jerry told me he bit your nose.
and what did i say?
a dog.
my dog.  one i intend to put to sleep.  extrapolate from there.
these things you are talking about. you did them to jerry?
yes, that is right.
I am still listening.
jerry is dangerous.  jerry has killed --
i do not believe you.
belief is immaterial.  what is important is the truth... it is been my job to find jerry.  I am very much responsible for him.
if this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like i now know too much to live.  why are you telling me all this?
so you will believe what i tell you next.  because i need to find jerry.  and i do not think i can do that without you.
where did you get it?
you do recognize it then?
it was my father's.  kept it in his wallet.  he was murdered --
i know the story.  a federal judge.  he denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
not a man.  ezekiel walters.
walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
you sound so sure.
in jerry's safety deposit box.
i do not understand.
go to the northeast corner.  call a cab.  bring the pizza.  then there is a poem.  roses are red, violets are blue, if the pope goes to washington, i would, too.
what the hell does that mean?
it is okay.  I am game.
i want this box rigged with a beacon!
you look great.
thanks.
are you okay?  i wish i had not told you what i did.  but i can not help the way i feel.  you do not hold that against me, do you?
no.  that would not be fair.  where are we going, jerry?
it would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you.  but first things first.
what is it?
there is a car following us. probably another one flanking us the next street over.
we are going to queens?
not today.
now what?
this way.
after you.  it is okay.  I am the one who left it here.
where are we going, jerry?
connecticut.
what is in connecticut?
what about them?
how come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three.  john wilkes booth. mark david chapman.  lee harvey oswald.
john hinkley.  the guy who shot reagan.  he only had two names.
reagan did not die.  if he had died, everybody would know what johnny's middle name was.
my father's house.
come on.
how do you really know there is gold in fort knox?  just because they say so?  we should go to tennessee and demand to see it.
you go.  send me a postcard.
liza?
did you kill him?
is that what they told you?
did you kill my father?
then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
he gave it to me.
i do not understand.
where were you the day he died?
at a horse show.
that is the last time you rode, is not it?  do you think it was your fault?  is that why?
did you kill my father?!
no...!  but they trained me to. m.k. ultra.  ex-catcher.  america works.  get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
jerry.  please.  you do not understand.  i have to know.  it is all i think about.  do you have any idea what it is like not to know?
yeah.  i know what it is like.
then tell me what happened.
can not give you the details because i can not remember.  i went to court to kill him.  at the ezekiel walters hearing.  i was supposed to shoot him at the press conference.  you were there. that is the first time i saw you.
love at first sight?
i do not know what it was.  all i know is i had a gun in my hand, but when i saw you standing with him, i could not do it.  if that is love, it is not so bad.  i found a part of myself that day. i could not go back.
back where?
to jonas.  i did not know that at the time.  did not know who he was.  but i knew inside, whoever he was, he would send someone else.  so i started watching your father.  i wanted to keep him safe.
someone else might call it stalking.  my dad felt it.  he started carrying a gun.
he kept it in the side table in the front hallway.  he showed me.  i visited a few times.  then one of jonas's guys visited.  when i arrived, your dad was dying.
why?  what do these guys have to do with ezekiel walters?
walters was their fall guy.  blow up a building and blame a nut. create fear.  do not you see?  your father was not trying to keep walters in prison.  he was looking into getting him out.  he did not believe the official story.
why not?
why not, jerry?
because he believed me.
how did you get the picture?
your father, he was dying.  he was worried about you.  he took your picture out to look at it.  he called you his baby.
i believe you.
you do?
you got to get out of here.  my cell phone's on.  back in the truck.
they will trace it.
I am sorry.
it is okay.  you...  you thought i was bad.
we have arranged for you to take the blame.  everyone knows how you have been harassing the poor girl.
liza!
you should not watch, jerry.  it is a moment without hope.
you have never seen her run.
federal bureau of investigation.
i need to speak with an agent lowry.
the office is closed for the evening. is this an emergency?
do you have an agent lowry in your new york office?
yes.
then this is a goddamn emergency.
go ahead, miss sutton.
agent lowry?
liza sutton is dead.
then i can not be hurt anymore.
can i talk to you a second?
go ahead.  we will be right down.
do you believe me?
yeah, i do.
i want to believe you, too.
what do you mean?
who is the deputy director of the f.b.i.?
you think we have time to fool around like this?  come on.
what gave me away?
nothing.  i was just making sure. so, who are you?
i'm, it really does not matter. think c.i.a. and exponentiate. I am a government employee and I have been watching jerry for awhile.
and jonas?
he is why i watch jerry.  jerry's the bait for jonas.
he is shown himself.  why have not you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
jonas builds assassins for a living.  several of whom may be in place already.  we would like to kill a few birds with one stone.
where do you think jerry is?
no idea.  honest.  what are you going to do?
I am going to find him.  because he would find me.
do not go home.  and do not go to work.  either one could be bad.
what do you suggest?
that you come with me.
i do not think so.
blue moon... blue moon...
jerry...?  jerry.
blue moon...
you saw me standing alone ...
without a song in my heart.
without a love of my own.
blue moon...
you knew just what i was there for.
liza?
where are you?
how did you know?
i spent two years here.  this used to bring the med-cart.  demerol. phenobarb.  it is jacob's ladder.
get in.  I will pull you up to the fourth floor.
what about you?
get up there and we will get it back down here for me.  now.
geronimo is down.
it is up.  love gives you wings. you can fly away from here.
do not do this.
