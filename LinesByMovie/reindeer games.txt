no, not that, no...  i mean this, the whole thing. start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. get a boyfriend like this. tell me the truth.
well. you're not the first guy i wrote to. but you're the only one i kept writing to.
yeah. me too.  why? i mean i know why for me, why i paid for the ad. but you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?
i told you, nick. remember?
tell me again.
all the guys i've ever been with... they never want to know me. who i am on the inside. they just want to qet inside. when they do, they think that means they know who i am. that i trust them. that they know me. that there's nothing left to learn.  a guy like you, nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. i figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
had some bad relationships, didn't you.
not bad. just regular.  you wrote me wonderful things, nick. personal things.
well, wasn't all me, y'know.
yes it was all you --
guy i was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
i'm talking about the heart, nick. i'm not talking about the words.
y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
then he shoulda signed his name.
where the hell are you going?
provisions! we are not leaving that motel room again till after new year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  what's good?!
ashley, jesus --
can't survive on our bodies alone, nick.  hurry up!
ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  so don't talk to me about little white lies.
you need a coat!
ash, you've gotten me enough --
no boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat!

blackjack, nick, blackjack i am good at. i mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? since you worked there?
security, ash, i just worked security. they wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
and the slots, slots i'm good at too. wouldn't that be fun?
we'll have more fun in detroit.
we could live it up and --

...the truck driver...
he's not a bad person, nick... he's not...
since janey moved in... gabriel... he's come over more and more. to the apartment. janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
what the fuck is going on.
he read the letters, nick. some day i wasn't there. he went through my room. he found your letters.
what's going on!!!

nick, no --
you sold him out.
nick --
when'd you decide to do it, ash? after which of his letters, huh? the fortieth? the fiftieth? the first?!
nick, what are you --
i'm not nick!  you thought you'd fuck him over?! well he's fucked you! i've never worked at some casino! i can't help you! because he's not me!

jesus christ!
watch your mouth, man. it's christmas.
i'm not nick!
get the hell off of me!
nick, it won't work. it won't work!
he'll kill you.
you're not hearing me here --
my brother's killed people, i know he has. truckers. if you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
he didn't "find" nick's letters, did he.
nick, please, it's me --
you told him about nick's letters.
no, nick, no --
you're in on this.
i love you!
your pen palls dead, lady.
if you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. if they think you're not you, they will kill you. don't you see? i know what you're doing, but it won't work!
nick died for me....
i won't let him hurt you! he just wants what you know!
...maybe i die for nick...
just tell him what you know, nick! that's all they want! and we'll get out of this!
you're a good writer, nick. i give this writing an a-plus.
i never worked at no casino.
gabriel, you promised!
i promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! when he helped us! loverboy don't want to play!
you promised me!
and you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
he'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway.  bury him all over the place.
no!
hey. she says she loves you, nick.
she says a lot of things.
she's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. you just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. my sister loves you, motherfucker, and i ain't gonna have you break her heart.
wish i had a brother like you.
a girl says she loves you, you say something.
i had better sex in prison.
heyyy. be nice, convict. we're gonna be working together here.  get him back in the rig.
where's she work?

j.c. penney. beauty and fragrances.
what's her middle name?
samantha.
what'd they call her in high school?
bam bam.
what'd they call her in college?
what college.
where'd she drop her cherry?
gabriel!
canada.
be more specific.
a station wagon in canada.
what's her greatest fear?
her brother.
wrong, nick. it's drowning.
no. it's her brother.
let's get back on the road. it's time to start talking, nick. time to start telling tales --
nick don't talk till nick gets something.
you want that for here or to go?
i been in iron mountain for two years, truck driver. i do one more crime, i'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. you want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? i want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
you knew the place --
hey.
gabriel! you said talk to him. that's all you ever said...
we're talking, aren't we?
how much money's in that casino? day-to-day.
i don't know.
the hell you don't.
five million?
you wrote ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working christmas eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. and the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. that a true story now?
christmas... eve...
you know where the guards are. you know how to get in and out. you know where the money is.  we're taking down that casino, convict. you're the guy gonna tell us how.
hey, it's... been two years --
we got faith in you, nick mason.  you're our inside man.
here ya go, convict. we cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. what you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
and where they hide the real money.
hell. ten?
and which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
start talkin
who the hell made this map.
what?
i said, who the hell made the map?
i did.
this isn't the tomahawk.
what the fuck are you talking about.
this is the front entrance, right? you get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. blackjack's here to here -- lined up. what's this, the cage? cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
that's what it looks like!
since when? what the hell is this room?
buffet. whaddya think it is?
buffet is by the goddamn bar! what the hell kind of map is this?!
we walked the place for a week.
and i worked there. for a year.
map is kinda dirty, monster...
they changed the layout.
they changed the layout -- whadda they call you? mr. monster? they remodeled the place. when i worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
jack. jack bangs.
right, jack bangs. uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. maybe get a better crowd. musta gone and done it while i was in the mountain.  i don't know this map, man. how the hell am i supposed to tell you what door goes where?
they wouldn't have changed the security setup.
when i worked there, this was bangs, office. back here. he kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the indians. called it the... uh...  ...the powwow safe.
the powwow safe?
his personal safe, he gave it a name. now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? then who knows what else they changed.
so what the hell good are you...
you'd have to get me inside.  get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. then i could work with your map.
wrong, convict. you walk in there, they recognize you.
they won't recognize me.
why not.
trust me. they won't recognize me.
we'll trust you when we're rich. why not.
'cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
bring back some memories, nick?
more than you know.
rather be back in the mountain?
might as well be.
don't have weather channel in the mountain, nick.
he said he wanted to talk to you. when he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, i wanna talk to him." i thought he meant back in detroit. i thought he meant --
but you knew why. knew why, didn't ya.
i thought we'd have a few more days.
for what? you to talk me into "helping"? what, he promise you a share of the winnings?
no!
well, shit, judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
nick! he wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! that's all he wants!  i hate him, nick... you know how...
so get him outta your life. get out of michigan. they got perfume counters in chicago, don't they?
not without you.
since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
they run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. but gabriel knows some guys in new york, miami, guys he helps get guns to detroit. hides 'em with his regular loads.
he working for them on this one?
no. he wants to be working for himself someday.
and i'm his ticket.  what's the last place they took down?
what?
gabriel and his guys. what's the last place they robbed?
they've never done a robbery?
they're truck drivers.
then they do need me, don't they. they really need me...
we're gonna get out of here, nick. we're gonna get out of this...
we? what "we"...
get your own room, ashley.
nick...
get your own room.
having romance problems, romeo?
not with you.
goddamn, merlin. there any part of the day you don't smoke?
there anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
cancer-sucker.
acid-chewer.
a cowboy. you're going to send me into an indian casino disguised as a cowboy. have you thought this entirely through?
put it on.
you're a country-western singer up from nashville for the the holidays. visiting your grandma on the lake, driving into the tomahawk for some scotch and slots. you only play the slots, you got that? don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
what kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
you do.
at least gimme video poker.
shut the fuck up. you play what your girlfriend plays. ashley's going in with you. you talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. you walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, i want to know the run of the place.
do i get a country-western name?
you get recognized, convict, you get a country-western funeral.
y'know what, guys? i woke up this morning, i got a really lucky feeling going on. i mean it, i'm feeling that good. i wouldn't be surprised if i walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. hell, we wouldn't even have to --
get out.
you got one hour.
i'm gonna need some money.
ten dollars? what do i do with ten dollars?
don't tip.
monster. if we're working together here, we gotta be working together. i can't walk in there looking like the lone fucking ranger with ten bucks to throw down. you don't want me getting noticed, right? not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred.
who's robbin' who here, gabriel...
get in there and watch 'em. watch their every fuckin' move.
there's no snow in vegas, 'kay? they don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. they got egypt down there, right, they got monte carlo, hawaii, they got ancient rome, but where's the winter castle, right? where's the swiss miss chalet? where's the big fucking igloo?
we understand you, mr. bangs.
capades? they don't do it. mittens? outlawed. why?
we're aware of your position.
because down there this is money. up here this is heat.  you wanted vegas quality, i brought it to you. you wanted vegas press, i gave it to you. but guys, please, guys... i can't get you vegas profits... till one of ya does some spirit dance and does something about this snow.
i'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three russian girls, they look like meryl streep, they can juggle anything.
mr. bangs.
guys. we're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? nobody does that in michigan. nobody.
the tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
i'm putting liquor in the drinks, i'm giving 10-times odds on craps, i got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! show me another buffet's gonna offer you coke and pepsi! whaddya want me to do?!
we want to see our casino making money again, mr. bangs. making money for our community.
so does it look a lot different?
here and there. restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. tables've been moved around; the big man's office, i dunno, might be upstairs now.
that guy knows you?
yeah, uh. mike. that's mike.
what the hell was that about --
he didn't recognize me. back off, willya? he didn't recognize me.
nick, what happened --
there went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. i gotta fix this thing --  -- drink this for me.
thanks, sister. how are ya.
fuckin' freezing.
hell yeah. you work here long?
five years. since it opened.
how long ago was your makeover?
my what?!
no, the place. the remodeling. moving everything around.
where the hell did he go?
monster. there never was a structure change. this place was built the same from day one.
that motherfucker --
and monster... he was talking with the casino manager. nick was talking to him.
we get to the bridge, we're all right!
nick, the ice is --
get to the bridge!  hey! hey! down here!
a for effort, nick, honestly, a for effort and an honorary degree. i'm surprised you never escaped from the mountain.
...never... tried...
nick, here's what we're gonna do. in the spirit of the season, i'm going to give you a chance. i understand you're unhappy. right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on tv.  so we're gonna have a contest.
got something to say to me, nick?
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
what'd you tell that casino manager?
nnn... nothing...
you were talking to him! what'd you tell him!?
nothing... i promise-nothing...
maybe something about a robbery?
no!
he thought i was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
i been driving rigs a long time, nick. four, five million miles of road. worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less i was driving fifteen hours a day. tell 'em i needed sleep, i needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
it's time for me... to be working for me. i want mine, nick. and i need you.  did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
no, gabriel... no...
man, monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
nick. i been trying to hit you.
jesus christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
all i wanted... was to make it home... for a little of dad's turkey, and mom's stuffing... aunt lisbeth's acorn gravy... aunt mary's cranberry buns...
we'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
...haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
shh, now. rest now. two years, nick. you haven't had cranberry buns in two years.
you saved my life.  you could have run, but you didn't. you saved me.
you saved me.
i saved you because i love you, nick.  why'd you save me?
i'm sorry, nick... i'm so sorry...
don't say my name...
i love you, nick...
ash. don't say it. don't say my name.
they'll have guns.
what?
you said they've run guns, in their trucks. so they'll have guns. to do this robbery. they'll have serious guns.
i don't know...
we'll need one.
i'm going to have to be inside that casino. when it happens. i'll need to be part of it. i can't just be drawing some map.
nick, what are you talking about?
we need to find a way to make me part of it.
part of... with them?
knew a guy in joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. his lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray.
that right? shit. i used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. you ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?
this trucker? met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. he's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. his tongue. sucks it right down.
my guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
his lips went next. you ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
start singing.
i have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
sing it in pictures, nick.
what you gotta worry about first is the guards. place doesn't look much richer than when i worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. there'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. eyes in the sky. they see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
how do we take them out?
you gotta get someone upstairs.
how do we do that?
across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. keypad access.
what's the code?
uh... they change it every month. i wouldn't know.  if there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. you gotta draw 'em out.
without having them hit the alarms.
i got an idea on that one. once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. there's a security camera room that videotapes everything. you've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
what about the money?
you lock down security, you move behind the cage. you hit the count room. there'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. cashiers'll know it. they'll have alarms.
what about the powwow safe?
what?
the powwow safe. the secret safe. you said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
oh. right. yeah. that's, uh upstairs. uh. here. powwow safe.
so. you're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. you're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  you need six.
we got five. putting ashley outside.
you need six.
no.
you go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. you need six.  six is me.
no.
you guys get caught, i go away for good. i got an interest in making sure you don't. you need a sixth man covering an exit. what're you gonna do about it.
i want a map of that security level. every room, every guard, every thing.
six men means six guns.
no way.
i'm no threat without a gun.
no, you're not.
there'll be people in that casino. i can't keep them from leaving if i don't get a gun. i don't need bullets, monster... but i gotta be a threat.
no gun.
well. what you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
that part, nick... was planned out the day i read your letters.
what. we all gonna dress up like cowboys?
not cowboys, nick. not cowboys.
you gotta be kidding me.
'tis the season, convict.
can't be attracting attention, right?
what, we walking in there and delivering toys?
he wants to see your map.
i'm almost done.
he says he wants it now.
if he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. i'm working on it here.
how are we gonna do this, nick?
you're the getaway girl. the money's gonna get to you eventually. gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. but i can't do that without a gun. any luck talking to him?
bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
is there any way you could get into his truck?
no.
we need a gun, ash. we need a gun...
here's the picasso. is he in his room?
they all are. football's on.

millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. i was in the mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
she set them up. all of them.
why not have her pretend to find me? pretend to write me and reel me in? tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named ashley?
and you set me up.
always wanted to rob that casino, rudy. way back when i worked there. what better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.
paid the alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. he's a lifer, what does he care. paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story i was dead. once the wound healed up...  got out of the mountain this morning. and tonight i'm a rich man.
how'd you know i'd do it.
do what?
walk outta there and tell her i was you.
hell, you never needed to convince ashley you were me. just the dumb fucking truckers. i figured i'd talked enough about the tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot i'd remember
hm. well. they'd have killed you if you weren't me, rudy. we knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough.
they had the weapons and the willpower. we just gave them their inside man.
you gave them me.
i gave them me.  said some nice things about me, rudy. i appreciate it. but don't worry. i do love her. and she loves me. you had that right all along.
what's the first thing, man? what's the first thing you're gonna do?
haven't thought about it.
hell you haven't.
get to thinking about it, it won't happen.

for twenty-five, she sounds pretty mature.
yeah. you grow up in detroit, you get matured real quick.
what if she sees you, man, sees what you look like... and it's not there. you just don't do it for her.
me and her got a connection.  read this part. read the part about stuffing her stocking.
she's using a new perfume.
no, i think that's just oranges. she writes here she's eating oranges.
oh.
shoulda written to that magazine, rudy. i'm gonna walk outta here, walk right into a relationship. not some one-nighter, man... a relationship. you? you're gonna walk outta here with bus fare. searching for the drunkest skirt in the room.
mornin', gorgeous. more egg nog?
shoulda written, rudy...
all i want... is to make it to sidnaw, and sit down for christmas dinner. watch some ball with my old man, sleep in my old bed, and have leftovers for bout six months.
thought you hated sidnaw.
just taste that christmas turkey.
thought you hate your old man.
five years, nicky. five years.  i just want to go home.
don't look like he missed the sunlight.
pinscher told me alamo thinks i'm the one ratted on him beating up cree. since i was there, i saw it, he thinks i got him sent to solitary.

so maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to motor city for new year's. she says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? i'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
what, working security?
no, i'm through with that shit. ashley's right. gotta start doing something i got a stake in. get a business going.
i don't know, i've seen the business world.

i figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
no, no --
saw my outfit or something, my coat --
no, hey, i like your coat --
saw me --
ashley, no. that was me, that's what i was scared of. i mean, be serious... i ain't exactly looking like mr. universe here.
you are to me.
thought you wrote you had a mustache.
i can get another one going. y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
no, no, no. be like you want to be.
do that again.

one more. smile. one more.
no, c'mon --
i've been dreaming about that smile, ashley mercer. for a long time.
tell me something. this the first time you've ever done this?
go to hell, nick mason, what's that supposed to mean --
no, not that, no...  i mean this, the whole thing. start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. get a boyfriend like this. tell me the truth.
well. you're not the first guy i wrote to. but you're the only one i kept writing to.
yeah. me too.  why? i mean i know why for me, why i paid for the ad. but you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know?
i told you, nick. remember?
tell me again.
all the guys i've ever been with... they never want to know me. who i am on the inside. they just want to qet inside. when they do, they think that means they know who i am. that i trust them. that they know me. that there's nothing left to learn.  a guy like you, nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. i figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
had some bad relationships, didn't you.
not bad. just regular.  you wrote me wonderful things, nick. personal things.
well, wasn't all me, y'know.
yes it was all you --
guy i was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him --
i'm talking about the heart, nick. i'm not talking about the words.
y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too...
then he shoulda signed his name.
where the hell are you going?
provisions! we are not leaving that motel room again till after new year's: we need ten days worth of provisions!  what's good?!
ashley, jesus --
can't survive on our bodies alone, nick.  hurry up!
ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate?
yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby.  so don't talk to me about little white lies.
you need a coat!
ash, you've gotten me enough --
no boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat!
baby, c'mon, all this stuff... i haven't gotten you anything --

thank you.
well, i don't know about that --
blackjack, nick, blackjack i am good at. i mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? since you worked there?
security, ash, i just worked security. they wouldn't be rolling out the red carpet --
and the slots, slots i'm good at too. wouldn't that be fun?
we'll have more fun in detroit.
we could live it up and --
ashley. we're not going anywhere i used to work.
baby, i'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. i get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
i'll see what i can do.

my brother's killed people, i know he has. truckers. if you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
he didn't "find" nick's letters, did he.
nick, please, it's me --

no, nick, no --
you're in on this.
i love you!
your pen palls dead, lady.
if you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. if they think you're not you, they will kill you. don't you see? i know what you're doing, but it won't work!
nick died for me....
i won't let him hurt you! he just wants what you know!
...maybe i die for nick...
just tell him what you know, nick! that's all they want! and we'll get out of this!
you're a good writer, nick. i give this writing an a-plus.
i never worked at no casino.
gabriel, you promised!
i promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! when he helped us! loverboy don't want to play!
you promised me!
and you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!
he'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked-up boyfriend anyway.  bury him all over the place.
no!
hey. she says she loves you, nick.
she says a lot of things.
she's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. you just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. my sister loves you, motherfucker, and i ain't gonna have you break her heart.
wish i had a brother like you.
a girl says she loves you, you say something.

what's her greatest fear?
her brother.

no. it's her brother.
let's get back on the road. it's time to start talking, nick. time to start telling tales --
nick don't talk till nick gets something.
you want that for here or to go?
i been in iron mountain for two years, truck driver. i do one more crime, i'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. you want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? i want some hot-goddamn-chocolate.
you knew the place --
hey.
gabriel! you said talk to him. that's all you ever said...
we're talking, aren't we?
how much money's in that casino? day-to-day.
i don't know.
the hell you don't.
five million?
you wrote ash that letter, you told her that story 'bout working christmas eve, bout how they'd send half the security guys home, nobody comin, in that night. and the rest of you got shit-faced drinking hot buttered rum. that a true story now?
christmas... eve...
you know where the guards are. you know how to get in and out. you know where the money is.  we're taking down that casino, convict. you're the guy gonna tell us how.
hey, it's... been two years --
we got faith in you, nick mason.  you're our inside man.
here ya go, convict. we cased the place in the fall, got the layout down. what you're gonna do is show us where each of these doors go, what the upstairs level looks like, where they got the alarms, all of it.
and where they hide the real money.
hell. ten?
and which of these doors here lead up to the security level?
start talkin
who the hell made this map.
what?
i said, who the hell made the map?
i did.
this isn't the tomahawk.
what the fuck are you talking about.
this is the front entrance, right? you get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. blackjack's here to here -- lined up. what's this, the cage? cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around --
that's what it looks like!
since when? what the hell is this room?
buffet. whaddya think it is?
buffet is by the goddamn bar! what the hell kind of map is this?!
we walked the place for a week.
and i worked there. for a year.
map is kinda dirty, monster...
they changed the layout.
they changed the layout -- whadda they call you? mr. monster? they remodeled the place. when i worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
jack. jack bangs.
right, jack bangs. uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. maybe get a better crowd. musta gone and done it while i was in the mountain.  i don't know this map, man. how the hell am i supposed to tell you what door goes where?
they wouldn't have changed the security setup.
when i worked there, this was bangs, office. back here. he kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the indians. called it the... uh...  ...the powwow safe.
the powwow safe?
his personal safe, he gave it a name. now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? then who knows what else they changed.
so what the hell good are you...
you'd have to get me inside.  get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. then i could work with your map.
wrong, convict. you walk in there, they recognize you.
they won't recognize me.
why not.
trust me. they won't recognize me.
we'll trust you when we're rich. why not.
'cause you're gonna get me a disguise.
bring back some memories, nick?
more than you know.
rather be back in the mountain?
might as well be.
don't have weather channel in the mountain, nick.
he said he wanted to talk to you. when he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, i wanna talk to him." i thought he meant back in detroit. i thought he meant --
but you knew why. knew why, didn't ya.
i thought we'd have a few more days.
for what? you to talk me into "helping"? what, he promise you a share of the winnings?
no!
well, shit, judas, you shoulda at least gotten that --
nick! he wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! that's all he wants!  i hate him, nick... you know how...
so get him outta your life. get out of michigan. they got perfume counters in chicago, don't they?
not without you.
since when do some trucker pals start thinking big, anyway?
they run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. but gabriel knows some guys in new york, miami, guys he helps get guns to detroit. hides 'em with his regular loads.
he working for them on this one?
no. he wants to be working for himself someday.
and i'm his ticket.  what's the last place they took down?
what?
gabriel and his guys. what's the last place they robbed?
they've never done a robbery?
they're truck drivers.
then they do need me, don't they. they really need me...
we're gonna get out of here, nick. we're gonna get out of this...
we? what "we"...
get your own room, ashley.
nick...
get your own room.
having romance problems, romeo?
not with you.
goddamn, merlin. there any part of the day you don't smoke?
there anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit?
cancer-sucker.
acid-chewer.
a cowboy. you're going to send me into an indian casino disguised as a cowboy. have you thought this entirely through?
put it on.
you're a country-western singer up from nashville for the the holidays. visiting your grandma on the lake, driving into the tomahawk for some scotch and slots. you only play the slots, you got that? don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps.
what kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots?
you do.
at least gimme video poker.
shut the fuck up. you play what your girlfriend plays. ashley's going in with you. you talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. you walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, i want to know the run of the place.
do i get a country-western name?
you get recognized, convict, you get a country-western funeral.
y'know what, guys? i woke up this morning, i got a really lucky feeling going on. i mean it, i'm feeling that good. i wouldn't be surprised if i walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. hell, we wouldn't even have to --
get out.
you got one hour.
i'm gonna need some money.
ten dollars? what do i do with ten dollars?
don't tip.
monster. if we're working together here, we gotta be working together. i can't walk in there looking like the lone fucking ranger with ten bucks to throw down. you don't want me getting noticed, right? not getting noticed costs a guy at least a couple hundred.
who's robbin' who here, gabriel...
get in there and watch 'em. watch their every fuckin' move.
there's no snow in vegas, 'kay? they don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. they got egypt down there, right, they got monte carlo, hawaii, they got ancient rome, but where's the winter castle, right? where's the swiss miss chalet? where's the big fucking igloo?
we understand you, mr. bangs.
capades? they don't do it. mittens? outlawed. why?
we're aware of your position.
because down there this is money. up here this is heat.  you wanted vegas quality, i brought it to you. you wanted vegas press, i gave it to you. but guys, please, guys... i can't get you vegas profits... till one of ya does some spirit dance and does something about this snow.
i'm bringing in this great showroom act next week; these three russian girls, they look like meryl streep, they can juggle anything.
mr. bangs.
guys. we're doing it right, here. $5.99 prime rib? nobody does that in michigan. nobody.
the tribe is concerned that many of your... new ideas are not resulting in any new venues.
i'm putting liquor in the drinks, i'm giving 10-times odds on craps, i got the girls showing sixteen-percent more skin! show me another buffet's gonna offer you coke and pepsi! whaddya want me to do?!
we want to see our casino making money again, mr. bangs. making money for our community.
so does it look a lot different?
here and there. restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. tables've been moved around; the big man's office, i dunno, might be upstairs now.
that guy knows you?
yeah, uh. mike. that's mike.
what the hell was that about --
he didn't recognize me. back off, willya? he didn't recognize me.
nick, what happened --
there went my... damn... well, doesn't seem like security's all that switched... ash, shit, this mustache is starting to fall off. i gotta fix this thing --  -- drink this for me.
thanks, sister. how are ya.
fuckin' freezing.
hell yeah. you work here long?
five years. since it opened.
how long ago was your makeover?
my what?!
no, the place. the remodeling. moving everything around.
where the hell did he go?
monster. there never was a structure change. this place was built the same from day one.
that motherfucker --
and monster... he was talking with the casino manager. nick was talking to him.
we get to the bridge, we're all right!
nick, the ice is --
get to the bridge!  hey! hey! down here!
a for effort, nick, honestly, a for effort and an honorary degree. i'm surprised you never escaped from the mountain.
...never... tried...
nick, here's what we're gonna do. in the spirit of the season, i'm going to give you a chance. i understand you're unhappy. right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on tv.  so we're gonna have a contest.
got something to say to me, nick?
...ttt..tt... two out of three?
what'd you tell that casino manager?
nnn... nothing...
you were talking to him! what'd you tell him!?
nothing... i promise-nothing...
maybe something about a robbery?
no!
he thought i was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me!
i been driving rigs a long time, nick. four, five million miles of road. worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less i was driving fifteen hours a day. tell 'em i needed sleep, i needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else...
it's time for me... to be working for me. i want mine, nick. and i need you.  did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery?
no, gabriel... no...
man, monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me...
nick. i been trying to hit you.
jesus christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
all i wanted... was to make it home... for a little of dad's turkey, and mom's stuffing... aunt lisbeth's acorn gravy... aunt mary's cranberry buns...
we'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
...haven't had cranberry buns... in five whole years...
shh, now. rest now. two years, nick. you haven't had cranberry buns in two years.
you saved my life.  you could have run, but you didn't. you saved me.
you saved me.
i saved you because i love you, nick.  why'd you save me?
i'm sorry, nick... i'm so sorry...
don't say my name...
i love you, nick...
ash. don't say it. don't say my name.
they'll have guns.
what?
you said they've run guns, in their trucks. so they'll have guns. to do this robbery. they'll have serious guns.
i don't know...
we'll need one.
i'm going to have to be inside that casino. when it happens. i'll need to be part of it. i can't just be drawing some map.
nick, what are you talking about?
we need to find a way to make me part of it.
part of... with them?
knew a guy in joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. his lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray.
that right? shit. i used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. you ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue?
this trucker? met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. he's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. his tongue. sucks it right down.
my guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers.
his lips went next. you ever see some silicon-fucking-lips?
start singing.
i have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum
sing it in pictures, nick.
what you gotta worry about first is the guards. place doesn't look much richer than when i worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. there'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. eyes in the sky. they see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked.
how do we take them out?
you gotta get someone upstairs.
how do we do that?
across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. keypad access.
what's the code?
uh... they change it every month. i wouldn't know.  if there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. you gotta draw 'em out.
without having them hit the alarms.
i got an idea on that one. once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. there's a security camera room that videotapes everything. you've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes.
what about the money?
you lock down security, you move behind the cage. you hit the count room. there'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. cashiers'll know it. they'll have alarms.
what about the powwow safe?
what?
the powwow safe. the secret safe. you said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money.
oh. right. yeah. that's, uh upstairs. uh. here. powwow safe.
so. you're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. you're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front.  you need six.
we got five. putting ashley outside.
you need six.
no.
you go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. you need six.  six is me.
no.
you guys get caught, i go away for good. i got an interest in making sure you don't. you need a sixth man covering an exit. what're you gonna do about it.
i want a map of that security level. every room, every guard, every thing.
six men means six guns.
no way.
i'm no threat without a gun.
no, you're not.
there'll be people in that casino. i can't keep them from leaving if i don't get a gun. i don't need bullets, monster... but i gotta be a threat.
no gun.
well. what you guys have to plan out, then... is how you're going to get to that cage and that security level before anybody realizes anything's wrong. running in with ski masks and bullets flying ain't gonna do it.
that part, nick... was planned out the day i read your letters.
what. we all gonna dress up like cowboys?
not cowboys, nick. not cowboys.
you gotta be kidding me.
'tis the season, convict.
can't be attracting attention, right?
what, we walking in there and delivering toys?
he wants to see your map.
i'm almost done.
he says he wants it now.
if he wanted a photographic memory, he shoulda kidnapped one. i'm working on it here.
how are we gonna do this, nick?
you're the getaway girl. the money's gonna get to you eventually. gonna be my job to be the guy who walks outta there with it. but i can't do that without a gun. any luck talking to him?
bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
is there any way you could get into his truck?
no.
we need a gun, ash. we need a gun...
here's the picasso. is he in his room?
they all are. football's on.
keep 'em there for a little while.
he wants the money.
no, baby. he wants me.
he wants... your "sister"...
...whoever she is.
all those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
to all those cons...
searching for a money man...
we musta written what, twenty of 'em? and they were before this guy. one, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in leavenworth --
-- till he fucked his parole --
-- plus the forty to mason... how many letters is that?
that's a book, baby.  that's a book of love.
i can't take watching you touch him. i can't take his hands on you.
one more day, baby. one more day to christmas.
i've been doing good, though.
didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.
what, he should see me help you catch him?
he's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. he wants a gun, give him a gun. take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. the more manpower we've got in there, the better. he won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
he'll be dead when he does.
y'know something, baby? if you were my sister? i'd still want to wake up christmas morning with you...
mmm, baby. and i'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
here's my present to you, truck drivers --
where the hell's gabriel?
gabriel!
that's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view.  and that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.
i got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?
i got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs --
somebody better give me something with some goddamn bacon --
i don't know where you're going. but i'm going home.
we go together, nick. wherever... we go together. remember?
well. i'm going home.

was it your plan, monster? or was it hers.
i saved your life.
you shouldn't have.
he did love you, you know. nick. he did love you.
who wouldn't.
merry christmas, rudy.
i'm glad it was me.
merry christmas.
get in the car!
how'd you know my name...
what?
rudy. how'd you know my name?
what are you talking about?
you said merry christmas, rudy.
i... you told me your name was rudy. you told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't nick --
no --
you were screaming you weren't nick! and we just didn't fucking believe you!
but i never said rudy.
you said it a million times!
i never told you my name.
ash?
how'd you know my name was rudy.
ash?
how'd you know my name.
millie here used to serve drinks to these gunrunning truckers, real big talkers, talking bout a real score one day. i was in the mountain, man, what the hell, why not let her get friendly with 'em? let her tell 'em an idea she had, 'bout writing guys in prison. getting one who could show 'em a sure thing.
she set them up. all of them.
why not have her pretend to find me? pretend to write me and reel me in? tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named ashley?
and you set me up.
always wanted to rob that casino, rudy. way back when i worked there. what better way than to get some guys to rob it for me.
paid the alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. he's a lifer, what does he care. paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story i was dead. once the wound healed up...  got out of the mountain this morning. and tonight i'm a rich man.
how'd you know i'd do it.
do what?
walk outta there and tell her i was you.
hell, you never needed to convince ashley you were me. just the dumb fucking truckers. i figured i'd talked enough about the tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot i'd remember
hm. well. they'd have killed you if you weren't me, rudy. we knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough.
they had the weapons and the willpower. we just gave them their inside man.
you gave them me.
i gave them me.  said some nice things about me, rudy. i appreciate it. but don't worry. i do love her. and she loves me. you had that right all along.
