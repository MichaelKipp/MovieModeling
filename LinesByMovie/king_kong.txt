what have you got there?
a neolithic bronze ... reminiscent of the nias island cultures ... it ' s very curious. defiantly pagan. the use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... what do you think?
i think you're trying to run before you can walk, ann.
now look at this fine example of early hindu art ... i don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
i photographed it extensively, father.
photography teaches you nothing, ann! click! one second and you've seen all you're going to see. i want you sitting here with your paper and pencils ... i want to see every chisel mark reproduced with painstaking accuracy. understand the carving and you will understand the people! that ann, is the key to archaeology.
pleased to meet you ... hi, bow's it going? pleased to meet you! hi, carl denham ... how's it going?
we offer ourselves at your service, mr denham!
and i appreciate that so much, i really do - a sentiment that will be shared by audiences across america when they view my latest documentary sensation "indonesia ...hell hole of the world". ernie hemmingway's agreed to write the narration. we're going out through universal ... laemmale's promised me fifteen hundred screens.
you are most kind. we will be proud to assist you!
exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... that's what the public expect from a carl denham picture! lead us into the mountains, sir!
the mountains?
tell me mr ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
native costume?
y'know ... traditional ceremonies where the woman ... divest themselves of their undergarments.
we are a very modest and deeply religious people, mr denham.
that's too bad.
man eater!!!
a man eater! fantastic!  making history, herb
father!
these are priceless artifacts! they're ruining the site!
out! out! all of you! we have been issued with an exclusive permit -
father ... father!
hi - carl denham. i'm a big admirer of your work, sir. i've loved all your discoveries. i really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. it'll be good for you and good for me.
look mr denham - you're not welcome here. just pack up your cameras and go.
look, i've sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there's no island like that around here.
what a climax to the film - the first white men to set foot on ...  "skull island"  twentieth century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
i tell you it doesn't exist!
we need those co-ordinates -someone's gotta get back there and jot the rest of it down
father it's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ...  organize an expedition -
all in due course, ann. our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to london.
oh god, it's that bloody yank!
now now, ann! try be to polite.
he's grubbing for money, father.
i just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
no, it's not ok! we're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
you - calling me a thief? well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! you break into the tomb of some dead egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
tell me, mr driscoll - is it a requirement of the forestry business that you have to be as thick as the trees you cut down?
holy god! the mummy walks!
how dare you? my father is the british museum's most respected archeologist!
do they have him on display at the weekends?
god, you're so obnoxious! our work happens to be of great anthropological value!
value? ... value?
i'm sorry ...
no!
where do i charter a boat?
there's nothing fast enough to catch that. forget it. it's over.
i not doing this for me, jack! it's for my father. this is possibly the greatest anthropological discovery of the last two hundred years! it belongs to him! i'm going to that island ... nothing's going to stop me!
can you fly?
are you kidding?! that heap of junk will never leave the ground!
there's no island there. we're wasting our time!
i'm chartering this vessel,engelhorn - how many days?
two... maybe three.
i'm coming onboard! throw down a ladder!
you're outta your depth here, miss darrow!
there's no hard feelings, mr denham! i just want to come to the island with you!
does this look like the "queen mary"?? we don't take passengers! full steam ahead, captain engelhorn!
can i see the map? my father spoke of references to a beast god ...
kong is a myth, nothing but a native superstition, miss darrow. all we're going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts. now, if you'll excuse me, i'm trying to reduce my handicap.
yeah! life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
i don't know what happened to you, jack ... but i can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
when this boat finally reaches jakata, i'll be first off. you'll never see me again ... and believe me - that day cannot come soon enough. i've got no problem with you ignoring me for the rest of the voyage.
i guess that answers your questions. there's no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
well, that was a monumental waste of time! i pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  i made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
i want to thank you.
it's ok.i know what you were feeling.
i can't imagine you crying.
relax ... it was fifteen years ago. i don't do it now.
i hope it fits ... mrs denham's a big lady.
it's ... lovely.
miss darrow ... i've been thinking. i would very much like to dedicate this motion picture to the memory of your father. it's a great shame he wasn't able to join us on this adventure. truly a wonderful man.
i thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the albert hall. we'll take out a full page ad in variety - "the lord darrow benefit screening". we'll invite the king of england - hell, we'll get the whole royal family along! it'd be good for them and good for us!
to be quite honest, mr denham ... i find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
there's a light up ahead.
sun's coming up ...  we've been in the fog for six hours.
it's the same image - kong!
leave it, ann.
they're stoking the boilers. as soon as we've got some steam, we're outta here.
we should never have come! i pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. you'll be hearing from my lawyer!
jack!
we're leaving.
but . . . we can' t jack, i need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
ann ... you're father is dead. you have nothing to prove anymore.
oh jesus ... you took it.
jack! this is the archeological find of the century!
this shit is bad luck! don't you understand? you treat it like a game - two men have already died!
give it back!
i'm not sailing with this thing on board!
no! don't!
did you see her?
yeah, i saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
what was it, jack?
an ape ... some kind of ape.
listen buddy! cut the crap! we're looking for ann, not making a goddamn movie!
jack ... you get to save the girl and i get my third act! it's gonna be good for you and good for me!
you better not slow us down, denham!
holy shit! look at the size of that!
that's your monkey, denham.
kong ...
hey! i thought these things were supposed to be extinct!
) they are now.
they were just tasting the berries.
yeah? ... well, i gave 'em a taste of american lead ... and i don't see 'em coming back for seconds!
set up the camera boys! get a shot of me comin' ashore!
forget it, denham ... for godssake
i'm calling a wrap. we're heading back to the ship.
what?
the girl's dead, driscoll. there's no point continuing on.
denham! go back to the wall ... tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with ann!
i can't get back to the wall! i'll get eaten!
just take it easy .-- where are the others?
they' re dead.
oh my god ... ann?
barricade the gates! quick!
jack!...  jack!
not me. thought i'd head out west ... get into some redwood country.
how about ann? is she going with you?
haven't seen her - not since we got back.
she's got a bit of an attitude, that girl. she's turned down a bunch of money. too bad ... it would've been a great angle - "beauty and the beast".  i must be getting old - i thought you two had something going there.
are you nervous jack?
nab- let's get it over with.
did you fear for your life?
yeah.
it must have been terrifying?
yeah.
am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.ladies and gentlemen! i am touching the beast!
take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
get the hell out of here.''!
now ann ...
jesus christ ! how could you do this to him? how could you do this?
come on, come on! we gotta keep moving!
he's gonna die! they'll kill him!
take to look out there ..- have you seen what he's done? you're talking about a crazy animal!
you're the animals - all of you!
ann ... ann!
it' s alright jack ... it' s alright.
are you gonna start it up?
yeah.
why?
coz of something i lost.
what's that?
compassion.
what's compassion, mister.
