what have you got there?
a neolithic bronze ... reminiscent of the nias island cultures ... it ' s very curious. defiantly pagan. the use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... what do you think?
i think you are trying to run before you can walk, ann.
now look at this fine example of early hindu art ... i do not recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
i photographed it extensively, father.
photography teaches you nothing, ann! click! one second and you have seen all you are going to see. i want you sitting here with your paper and pencils ... i want to see every chisel mark reproduced with painstaking accuracy. understand the carving and you will understand the people! that ann, is the key to archaeology.
pleased to meet you ... hi, bow's it going? pleased to meet you! hi, carl denham ... how is it going?
we offer ourselves at your service, mr denham!
and i appreciate that so much, i really do - a sentiment that will be shared by audiences across america when they view my latest documentary sensation "indonesia ...hell hole of the world". ernie hemmingway's agreed to write the narration. we are going out through universal ... laemmale's promised me fifteen hundred screens.
you are most kind. we will be proud to assist you!
exotic lands, primitive people, dangerous animals ... that is what the public expect from a carl denham picture! lead us into the mountains, sir!
the mountains?
tell me mr ginting - are there any parts of your country where people still wear ... native costume?
native costume?
y'know ... traditional ceremonies where the woman ... divest themselves of their undergarments.
we are a very modest and deeply religious people, mr denham.
that is too bad.
man eater!!!
a man eater! fantastic!  making history, herb
father!
these are priceless artifacts! they are ruining the site!
out! out! all of you! we have been issued with an exclusive permit -
father ... father!
hi - carl denham. I am a big admirer of your work, sir. I have loved all your discoveries. i really want to work closely with you on this incredible find. it will be good for you and good for me.
look mr denham - you are not welcome here. just pack up your cameras and go.
look, I have sailed these waters for twenty-seven years ... there is no island like that around here.
what a climax to the film - the first white men to set foot on ...  "skull island"  twentieth century man comes face to face with a ... a ... naked stone age tribe!
i tell you it does not exist!
we need those co-ordinates -someone's got to get back there and jot the rest of it down
father it is somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ...  organize an expedition -
all in due course, ann. our first responsibility is to get these artifacts safely back to london.
oh god, it is that bloody yank!
now now, ann! try be to polite.
he is grubbing for money, father.
i just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
no, it is not ok! we are not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
you - calling me a thief? well, that is great, coming from a glorified grave robber! you break into the tomb of some dead egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
tell me, mr driscoll - is it a requirement of the forestry business that you have to be as thick as the trees you cut down?
holy god! the mummy walks!
how dare you? my father is the british museum's most respected archeologist!
do they have him on display at the weekends?
god, you are so obnoxious! our work happens to be of great anthropological value!
value? ... value?
I am sorry ...
no!
where do i charter a boat?
there is nothing fast enough to catch that. forget it. it is over.
i not doing this for me, jack! it is for my father. this is possibly the greatest anthropological discovery of the last two hundred years! it belongs to him! I am going to that island ... nothing's going to stop me!
can you fly?
are you kidding?! that heap of junk will never leave the ground!
there is no island there. we are wasting our time!
I am chartering this vessel,engelhorn - how many days?
two... maybe three.
I am coming onboard! throw down a ladder!
you are outta your depth here, miss darrow!
there is no hard feelings, mr denham! i just want to come to the island with you!
does this look like the "queen mary"?? we do not take passengers! full steam ahead, captain engelhorn!
can i see the map? my father spoke of references to a beast god ...
kong is a myth, nothing but a native superstition, miss darrow. all we are going to find on that island are some primitive people in grass skirts. now, if you will excuse me, I am trying to reduce my handicap.
yeah! life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
i do not know what happened to you, jack ... but i can not believe you were always this much of a bastard.
when this boat finally reaches jakata, I will be first off. you will never see me again ... and believe me - that day cannot come soon enough. I have got no problem with you ignoring me for the rest of the voyage.
i guess that answers your questions. there is no island on these co- ordinates - not even a lousy fog-bank.
well, that was a monumental waste of time! i pay good money, only to be taken on some wild goose chase!  i made the mistake of trusting my idiot translator!
i want to thank you.
it is ok.i know what you were feeling.
i can not imagine you crying.
relax ... it was fifteen years ago. i do not do it now.
i hope it fits ... mrs denham's a big lady.
it is ... lovely.
miss darrow ... I have been thinking. i would very much like to dedicate this motion picture to the memory of your father. it is a great shame he was not able to join us on this adventure. truly a wonderful man.
i thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the albert hall. we will take out a full page ad in variety - "the lord darrow benefit screening". we will invite the king of england - hell, we will get the whole royal family along! it would be good for them and good for us!
to be quite honest, mr denham ... i find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
there is a light up ahead.
sun's coming up ...  we have been in the fog for six hours.
it is the same image - kong!
leave it, ann.
they are stoking the boilers. as soon as we have got some steam, we are outta here.
we should never have come! i pay you good money, only to have my life endangered. you will be hearing from my lawyer!
jack!
we are leaving.
but . . . we can' t jack, i need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
ann ... you are father is dead. you have nothing to prove anymore.
oh jesus ... you took it.
jack! this is the archeological find of the century!
this shit is bad luck! do not you understand? you treat it like a game - two men have already died!
give it back!
I am not sailing with this thing on board!
no! don't!
did you see her?
yeah, i saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
what was it, jack?
an ape ... some kind of ape.
listen buddy! cut the crap! we are looking for ann, not making a goddamn movie!
jack ... you get to save the girl and i get my third act! it is going to be good for you and good for me!
you better not slow us down, denham!
holy shit! look at the size of that!
that is your monkey, denham.
kong ...
hey! i thought these things were supposed to be extinct!
) they are now.
they were just tasting the berries.
yeah? ... well, i gave 'em a taste of american lead ... and i do not see 'em coming back for seconds!
set up the camera boys! get a shot of me comin' ashore!
forget it, denham ... for godssake
I am calling a wrap. we are heading back to the ship.
what?
the girl's dead, driscoll. there is no point continuing on.
denham! go back to the wall ... tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with ann!
i can not get back to the wall! I will get eaten!
just take it easy .-- where are the others?
they' re dead.
oh my god ... ann?
barricade the gates! quick!
jack!...  jack!
not me. thought I would head out west ... get into some redwood country.
how about ann? is she going with you?
have not seen her - not since we got back.
she is got a bit of an attitude, that girl. she is turned down a bunch of money. too bad ... it would have been a great angle - "beauty and the beast".  i must be getting old - i thought you two had something going there.
are you nervous jack?
nab- let's get it over with.
did you fear for your life?
yeah.
it must have been terrifying?
yeah.
am actually laying my hand on the twenty-five foot gorilla.ladies and gentlemen! i am touching the beast!
take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
get the hell out of here.''!
now ann ...
jesus christ ! how could you do this to him? how could you do this?
come on, come on! we gotta keep moving!
he is going to die! they will kill him!
take to look out there ..- have you seen what he is done? you are talking about a crazy animal!
you are the animals - all of you!
ann ... ann!
it' s alright jack ... it' s alright.
are you gonna start it up?
yeah.
why?
coz of something i lost.
what is that?
compassion.
what is compassion, mister.
