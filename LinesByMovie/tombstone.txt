what'd the messican mean, a sick horse's gonna get us?  didn't make no sense.
he was quoting the bible, revelations: "behold a pale horse and the one that sat on him was death and hell followed with him."
well now that's a little more like it.
forget it.
excuse me?
i said forget it, answer's no, i don't want the job and that's final.  i'm going to tombstone and nothin' short of dyin's gonn stop me.  good day.
but wait, you don't understand-
no marshal, you don't understand. i'm through with lawing, i'm through with the whole proposition.  forever.  i did my duty, now i'd like to get on with my life.  that is if you don't mind.  jesus.  good day now.
i see, off to strike it rich, huh.  all right, fine, wish you luck.  tell you this though, never was a rich man yet didn't wind up with a guilty conscience.
already got a guilty conscience, might as well have the money too.
well how do we look?
hey!  virgil!  my god!  morgan!  hey, boy!  you look great!  both of you!
allie-girl...and louisa!  you're so lovely.  i'm at your feet, darlin'.  just at your feet.  guess it's only right.  ma always said you were the prettiest.
but she doted on the frowner
wyatt, i couldn't find a single store that had laudanum any-
mattie, they're here!  folks this is celia ann but you can call her mattie.  or even mrs.  earp if you prefer.
give him some good exercise?  sure some stud.  some string in fact. what're you gonna do, race 'em?
hope so.  clean up with this boy.
come up to the fire, honey.
i think i'll just lie down awhile
long as i live i'll never get used to that sound.
they're just lonely is all.  hell, i howl myself sometimes.
you get lonely?
look at that.  busted.  brand new money ward, too.  33 years old and i don't even have a decent watch.  'bout time i started lookin' out for myself.
well here we are a family again. been so long plain forgot how good it feels.  want to thank you for that, wyatt.  all your doin'.
we're gonna do it, boys.  gonna get ours.  feel it in my bones. all we have to do is keep our eyes on that brass ring.
boy, look at all those stars.  bet you can see every star there is. practical touch 'em.  kinda makes you think, you know?  i mean you look up and you think god made all that but he still remembered to make a little speck like me. kinda flattering really.  hey, wyatt, you believe in god?  no, come on, really, do you?
maybe, yeah.  hell, i don't know.
well what do you think happens when you die?
got me.  somethin'.  nothin'.  i don't know.
i read this book, book on spiritualism...
really?  what about hell?  they got a sign or what?
hey, wyatt, god damn it, i'm serious!
well that's your problem.  hey virge, see anything of doc while you were in prescott?
hit a streak when we left.  him and kate.
i said that's 500 to you, holliday.  in or out?
500? sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
here, doc.
bless you, darling  darling!  are you mad?  you're not wearing a bustle.  how lewd!
oh, for christ's sake!
ed bailey, you look like you're just ready to burst.  well call me a fool but i guess i'll just have to call.  cover your ears, darling.
god damn son of a...
isn't that a daisy?
just pick up your money and go. sick of listening to you simper.
now ed, are we cross?
skinny lunger, your guns don't impress me.  wasn't for those guns you'd be nothin'.
why ed, what an ugly thing to say!  does this mean you're not my friend anymore?  you know, ed, if i thought you weren't my friend i don't think i could bear it.
oh, my god...
does it hurt?  a lot?  good.
i calculate that's the end of this town.  and let's don't bother about the luggage, darling.
i been having the boy at the hotel pack us up every night since your streak started
newcomers, eh?  names john behan, i'm cochise county sheriff.  just hit town?
just this minute.  i'm wyatt earp, these're my brothers-
wyatt earp...dodge city, right?
gave all that up.  going into business.
well i'm the man to see.  besides sheriff i'm also tax collector, captain of the fire brigade, and chairman of the non-partisan anti- chinese league.  a man of many parts.  got a place to stay yet?  i also sit on the townlot commission.  got a couple of lovely cottages coming up for rent.  here, let me show you...
wyatt, meet fred white, he's town marshal.
lotta law around here.  just met the sheriff.
look pretty rough.
just like any other hard cases. gotta know how to handle 'em.
what about all these saloons?
ah, now that's the real mother- lode in tombstone.  up and down allen street, full-blast 24 hours a day, liquor, hostesses, gamblin', makin' money hand over fist.  all except the oriental.  on account of the element.  have a man for breakfast in there most days.  regular slaughter house. high-rollers won't go near it. too bad, nice place.
what can i get you?
let me have one of those cigars.  kinda nice in here.  you run it?
milt joyce, owner-operator.
well, excuse me for askin', milt, but isn't it kinda dead in here?
you see that bird at the faro table?  that's johnny tyler.  he barged in here one day, said he was takin' over the game, started slappin' customer, wavin' his gun around, scarin' off all the high-class play.  only trade comes in here now's just bummers and drovers, just the dregs.
why don't you get rid of him and get yourself straight dealer?
well sure, neighbor, easy to say.
you back that queen again, you son of a bitch, i'll blow you right out of that chair!  somethin' on your mind?
just wanted to let you know you're sitting in my chair.
that a fact?
yeah.  it's a fact.
for a man that don't go heeled you run your mouth kinda reckless.
don't need to go heeled to get the bulge on a dub like you.
that a fact?
yeah.  it's a fact.
well i'm real scared.
go ahead.  skin it.  skin that smoke wagon and see what happens.
listen mister, i'm getting' tired-
well we're off and running.  just acquired us a quarter-interest in the game at the oriental.
acquired?
so to speak.
doc!  how the hell are you?
perfect, wyatt.  simply perfect.
since when is faro a business?
didn't you always say gambling's an honest trade?
i said poker's an honest trade. only suckers buck the tiger.  the odds are all with the house.
depends how you look at it.  i mean it's not like anybody's holding a gun to their heads.
that's what i love about wyatt. he can talk himself into anything.
sheriff behan, doc holliday.
forgive me if i don't shake hands.
so how's tombstone treating you?
fine, fine.  but i was thinkin', you know what this town really needs is a race track.
actually, you know, that's not a bad idea, send a signal we're growing up.
very cosmopolitan.
i know him.  that's creek johnson.
easy, gents. private affair...  wyatt! doc! hey!
jack...
hello, wyatt!  hiya doc!
what was that all about?
drunks.  crawfished a bet, called him a liar.  i saw the whole thing.
sheriff, may i present a pair of fellow sophisticates, turkey creek jack johnson and texas jack vermillion?  watch your ear, creek.
very instructive
but who was the devil?
it's that woman from the coach!
i'll be damned...
her maiden name was sullivan.
better go with 'em, honey.  here's where i leave you.
no, stay.  please stay with me.
honey, i gotta start makin' money.
oh, all right.
well i guess i don't have to go right now.  i guess i could stay a little while.
no, no, i don't want to keep you.
no really, i can stay a while.
just go.  it's all right.  wyatt, really.  work well.
all right, well, good night.
all right, i'm on fire!  black seven, seven stickin' spades. let's go!
i'm your man...  you win again.  well played, sir. you are on fire.
told you.  i'm red hot, i'm blazin'!  now, red seven.  seven stinkin' diamonds.  look out!  five thousand!  let's go!
awful lot of money.
can't take the heat, get outta the kitchen.
you're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
damn!  all right, wait a minute...
so now we're in the mining business.  turning into regular tycoons.  gonna call this one the mattie blaylock.  mattie'll get a kick out of that, it's her maiden name.
and what a maiden, pure as the driven snow, i'm sure.
hey doc!  come on now.
just his style, morg.  doesn't mean anything.
so tell me, wyatt.  i'm curious. do you actually consider youself a married man?  forsaking all others?
well yeah.  pretty much.  i mean i was no angel when we met but people change doc.  i mean sooner or later you gotta grow up.
i see.  and what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? wyatt "she"?
you know damn well who i mean. that dusky-hued lady satan.
i don't know.  probably ignore her.
ignore her?
i'd ignore her.  people can change, doc.
i'll remember you said that.
satisfied?
i stand corrected.  wyatt.  you're an oak.
i'm retired.
good.  that's real good.
shut up, ike.
and you must be doc holliday.
that's the rumor.
you retired, too?
not me.  i'm in my prime.
yeah, you look it.
and you must be ringo.  look, darling, johnny ringo.  the deadliest pistoleer since wild bill, they say.  what do you think, darling?  should i hate him?
you don't even know him.
yes, but there's just something about him.  something around the eyes, i don't know, reminds me of... me.  no.  i'm sure of it, i hate him.
he's drunk.
in vino veritas.
age quod agis.
credat judaeus apella.
ecentus stultorum magister.
in pace requiescat.
see what i mean about it getting spooky?
curly bill, huh?  who was that other idiot?
ike clanton, old man's eldest son.  know he ain't got the stuff, makes him miserable.
yeah, and dangerous.
the man dealing faro.  who is he?
that's wyatt earp.  made quite a name for himself as a peace officer in kansas.
a peace officer... impressive man
yes, very.  and very married.
oh, so that's it...
that's my lovin' man.  just can't get enough.
enough?  never.
hey, is that "old dog tray"? sounds like "old dog tray".
what?
you know, stephen foster.  "oh, susanna".  "camptown races", stephen-stinkin'-foster!
i see, well this happens to be a nocturne.
a which?
you know, frederic-fucking-chopin.
why don't you just leave it alone?
no, i gotta do something.  i don't suppose you'd card-
none of my business, fred.
maybe i ought to go out there.
you will or you won't.  don't look to me.  i'm going to sleep.
he said to turn loose of him.
well i'm not so go home.
come on, you...
crack me back of the head like some stinkin' bull.  hell, you ain't no fightin' man, you're just a cop.
keep your eye on that brass ring. don't let anything side-track you.
i know, i need a keeper.
well i guess you can see, never a dull moment.  maybe you should stay around to see what happens next.  who know?  you might find a future here.
maybe even my destiny.
you know, i was thinkin', maybe we ought to open our own place. that's the real money.  build it up, milk it for all it's worth, then sell it off for a bundle and breeze out of this burg with more money than croesus and ready to live like kings.  let's you and me take a walk around town, virge, see if we can scout us out a couple of nice lots.
i can't hardly believe it.  it's working out just like you said, wyatt.  we're lootin' this burg six ways through sunday.
pretty fun too, isn't it?
kinda, actually, yeah.  i gotta admit.
i couldn't help it, wyatt.  i looked at that woman and it was just like somebody slapping me in the face.  i mean these people're afraid to even walk down the street and i'm trying to make money off it like some kind of god damn vulture.  that's not me, that's somebody i don't even know.
virgil, please.  don't do this to me.
it's got nothin' to do with you, wyatt.  it's-
nothing to do with me?  i'm your brother for christ's sake.  god, i don't believe this.  talk to him, will you?  or hit him.  oh no, don't tell me...
listen to me, both of you.  this is no good.  this is trouble we don't need.  for the first time in our lives we got a chance to stop wandering and finally be a family.  do this and you throw it all away.  you saw what happened to fred white.
come on, we're not about pickin' fights.  just gonna keep a little order, that's all.
yeah?
like you said, just gotta know how to handle 'em.  old fred wasn't up to it.  we know that we're doin', wyatt.
all right, say you're right, say you don't get yourself killed. there's something else.  it's too late for virge, he already rolled his bone.  but it's not too late for you, morg.
what're you talkin' about?
run for your lives, boys!  it's that great two-gun dog-catcher from kansas!
mcmasters, isn't it?  listen, you seen a black stallion with-
look, i got a rule.  i don't talk to lawmen.  dog-catchers neither.
i'm not a lawman, i'm just a private citizen getting' my property back
well in that case, i saw your horse.  billy clanton was takin' him up to the cut to show him off.  the boys're all up there right now, branding.  and in a mood.  still want your property back, mr. private citizen?
so what about you cowboys anyway?
if i had to explain it you wouldn't understand.  just say we're brothers to the bone.
yeah, but some of the things they say your brothers've done...
there's all kinds of horses, ain't there?  same with cowboys. what they do's their affair.  i don't preach and i don't judge.  i ain't no dog-catcher.
where'd you get that horse?
beauty, ain't he?
i asked where you got him.
where do you think?  i stole him.
look, i don't want any trouble with you but that's my horse and i mean to have him back.  one way or another.
come and get him.
look kid, i know what it's like, i was a kid, too.  even stole a horse once.  but you can't--
feel bad about ol' fred.  just can't hold back when i'm feelin' woolly.  still, feel kinda bad. but now we're square.  anyway no use for holdin' a grudge.  i deserved a rap in the head.
make you a deal.  my brother took over the marshal's office in tombstone.  got it in his head he's gonna make the place safe for widows and orphans.  you and your boys stay out of his way, i'll make sure he stays out of yours.
fair enough.  you know i got to admit, you got a lot of bark on you comin' up here like this.
they were all gonna jump me back there.  what ever happened to one against one?
ain't our way.  we go all on one, one on all.  fight one of us, you fight us all.  that's the cowboy way.
and how come you call yourselves cowboys?  cowhands ride for the brand.
oh, we ride for a brand all right.  this brand.  how 'bout you?
this brand.
we're gonna get along just fine.
maybe i jumped the gun.  maybe those cowboys aren't near as bad as they're painted.  you know i was thinkin', there's a lot of money in the cattle business...
wait a minute, you thinkin' of getting in bed with the cowboys?
business is business.  don't have to love 'em to work with 'em.  not if there's money in it.
you are the one, wyatt.  you sure are.
we've never actually met.  my name's-
wyatt earp, i know.  i was beginning to think we'd never meet.  this is fortuitous.  that means lucky.
i know what it means.
what is it?
easy now... that mare's in season.
oh...  now she's starting.  how do they know?
they know.  it's the scent.  we better split 'em up.
i have a better idea, let's run it out of them!
that was lovely!
you know you almost got us both killed back there?
fun though, wasn't it?
you'd die for fun?
wouldn't you?  you're laughing!  i was sure you never laughed.
i laugh sometimes
yes, but how often?  tell me, are you happy?
am i happy?  i don't know.  happy as the next man, i guess.  i don't laugh all day long like an idiot, if that's what you mean.
you're a little touchy about it.
i'm not touchy, i just, it's a silly question, that's all.  am i happy?  are you happy?
of course, i'm always happy. unless i'm bored.  that blonde woman, is that your wife?
what about her?
nothing... tell me, what do you want out of life?
where do you get these questions?
just answer.
i don't know, make some money, have some kids, you know.
doesn't suit you.
how would you know?
just doesn't, that's all.
well i ought to know my own mind and i'm tellin' you what suits me is a family and kids.  that suits me right down to the ground.  in fact, that's my idea of heaven.  all right, what's your idea of heaven?
room service.
see?  you're laughing again.  but that's what i want.  go places and move and never look back and just have fun.  forever.  that's my idea of heaven.  need someone to share it with, though.
you mean behan?  then why are you with him?
well he's handsome and he's charming.  he's all right.  for now.  don't say it, i know, i'm rotten.  i can't help it.  i've tried to be good but it's too boring.
the way you talk.  never heard a woman talk like that.
oh look, i haven't got time to be proper, i want to live.  i'm a woman, i like men.  if that's unladylike then i guess i'm not a lady.  at least i'm honest.
well you're different, no arguing that.  but you're a lady all right. i'll take my oath on it.
what's wrong?
i don't know, doesn't make any sense.  i almost can't look at you.  like it hurts.
i know, me too.  what should we do about it?
you know this is adultery.  you burn in hell for that.
then let's make sure we get our money's worth
i must say this certainly has been an unexpected little windfall.
fortuitous even.
and i don't even know your full name.
easy to fix.  wyatt berry stapp earp.
and i'm josephine sarah marcus. my friends call me josie.
josie... no, i'm gonna call you sadie.
i hate sadie.
well you'll always be sadie to me.
always?
getting late.  we better get back.
so i assume we're regarding this as just a kind of interlude.
look, it's too much of a tangle. i already cast my lot.  i can't go back and i can't sneak, feel back enough as it is.
you feel bad about this?  about me?
i didn't mean it that way.
you know you don't have to sneak. you could stay with me.  i know things, wyatt.  sweet things.  i could make you so happy.
i can't, i'm sorry.  forgive me.
that the bottle lou gave you? better go easy on that stuff.
i know what i'm doing.  where have you been?
out ridin'.  so... how you doin'?
i don't know.  i'm all right.
really?  you sure?
sure i'm sure.  what is this?
well, i was thinking, we've already made a pile of money. maybe we should just pull up stakes and move on.  and we could stay on the move, you know?  just keep going, see the world.  live on room service the rest of our lives.  how'd that be?
wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
just thinkin' out loud.  forget it.
doc won't quit, been up 36 hours. clanton came in an hour ago, they switched over to poker.  tried to get him to bed but he just won't let go.
i know.  and nobody can make him.
wyatt!  just in time.  pull up a chair.
been hittin' it awful hard, doc.
nonsense, i have not yet begun to defile myself.
but doc-
i won't be pawed at, thank you very much
sorry, sorry...
what d'you think of the singer?
nice voice.
that's not what i meant.
i saw that look on your face just now. what's between you and wyatt?
absolutely nothing.
what's wrong, doc?
nothing.  not a thing.  i'm right as the mail.
how you feeling, doc?
better.
that's good.  i knew it wasn't nothin'.
we must talk, darling.  it appears we have to... redefine the nature of our association.
what's that mean, doc?  you know i don't understand when you talk up high like that.  you mean you don't want to be my lovin' man no more?
not exactly...
i'm a good woman to you, doc. don't i always take care of you? nobody cares for you like me.  i'm a good woman.
yes, i know.  you are a good woman.
billy clanton, wes fuller, and billy claiborne.  now there's six of 'em.  this is like a bad dream.
just stay calm, use your head. it'll be all right.  just the same, though...  guess you better swear me in.
thought you swore you'd never carry that thing again.
yeah, well, i swore a lot of things.
here they are again.  look at 'em.
easy, virge, they're just tryin' to egg us on.
those cowboys're tellin' everybody in town they're gonna clean you out.  they're down in that lot right now behind the ok corral.
don't worry, doc, it's not your problem. you don't have to mix up in this.
wait till the liquor wears off. once they start getting headaches they'll lose interest.
wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
you'll never make that stick.
they're carrying guns in town.
virge, that's a misdemeanor.  you go down there to arrest 'em, something goes wrong, maybe this time somebody gets his head broke, suddenly it's a mess and it won't end there, you'll have cowboys comin' around lookin' for trouble from here to christmas. you gonna risk all that over a misdemeanor?
no, damn it, it's wrong, they're breakin' the law.
all right, virge, your call.  but give doc the shotgun.  they'll be less apt to get nervy if they see him on the street howitzer.
there they go.  look kinda like preachers.
yeah.  or undertakers.
virge, you're makin' the arrest. you make contact, i'll back you up.  morgan'll back me up, doc'll keep an eye out for trouble.  and keep your hands on your guns. they even look like they're gonna start something, buffalo 'em. right over the head.
wyatt, i know what i'm doin'.
look at 'em all.  they love it. how in the hell'd we get ourselves into this?
i'm sorry.  if there was any other-
i know.  just did what you had to. that banner and stuff, that's just ike.  don't worry about it.
how you doin', boy?
fine.  better.
you were right.  it's nothin' like i thought.  i almost wish...
i know, kid.  i know.  me too.
mattie.  what about this?
i need it.
'least you admit it.
admit what, i'm an opium fiend? no, wyatt, i just said i need it. i need something to keep me warm at night.
look, mattie, i know you're-
you know nothing.  what you don't know would fill a book.  jesus, i feel like it's when you're around i need it most.  you're never yourself, you never relax.  never. everything's so stiff and dead. you always have to keep a rein on everything, ever yourself.  oh, you smile sometimes, i've even seen you laugh.  but there's no light in your smile for me, wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. and i get cold, wyatt.  i get so cold.  what's between you and that jew woman?
all right, look.  i can make it right, i can make this up to you, mattie.  i can, i swear.
will you go to her and tell her right in front of me she's nothing to you?  right out loud so i can hear?  tell her she's nothing, tell her she's nobody, just dirt?  will you do that?
listen, i want to talk to you.
not now.  i don't have time.
i saw that look pass between you and wyatt at the fight.  listen to me!  you're mine!  understand? you're my woman and i'm your man.
my man?  you told wyatt you'd disarmed those men.  do you actually believe after that i could see you as my man?  you're just a dirty little fixer.
you whore!  you filthy whore!
dropped him, that was it.  sorry if i made a worse mess for you.
i'm the one made a mess.  made a right fair mess of the whole thing.
that's just my game.
all right, lunger.  have at it.
on three?  you call it.
here it come: one-two-
i want them spitting blood!
easy, johnny.  now ain't the time.  i tell you, boys, even i'm worried what'll happen once ringo runs this outfit!  god have mercy!
there's no god, there's no devil, i hate the god damn world!  i want to die!
easy, son.  you just need to get your feet back under you, that's all.  come on, boy, let's kick south.  down to the old playground.
easy.  i just wanted to tell you things're about to start changing around here.  lots of so-called hard cases and tough-nuts swagger around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play.  none of 'em.
i don't understand.
you will after tonight.  bet on it.
getting late.  guess i'll turn in.
bundle up, virge.  cold out there.
that thunder's sure somethin'.
that didn't sound like thunder.
virgil?
wyatt...
no, wait.  please.  i know nothin' i say'll fix things but i want you to know it wasn't me.
no?  brothers to the bone, right?
not anymore, not after this.
get down, boy.
morgan, are you crazy?  they're out gunning for us!  what the hell're you doin'?
what's it look like?  they want a piece of me they can come and get it, i'm not crawlin' into my hole.
morg, use your head.
i am usin' it, wyatt.  been wonderin' how the hell we got in this tangle.  you know they hit clum's house, too?  shot up his wife. his wife.  who ever heard of that?  men sneakin' around in the dark, back-shootin', scarin' women?  they're bugs, wyatt.  you know all your smart talk about live and let live?  ain't no live and let live with bugs.
i know, i was wrong.  but morg, look, we got to get out.
listen to yourself, wyatt.  lie down and crawl or you might get hurt?  what kinda talk is that? that's virgil lyin' over there, wyatt.  our own brother.  ruined for life.  no sir, i ain't going no place.  you want to go, fine. i'm stayin' right here and have it out with those bastards.
i just got it fixed.
you're on.
you were right, wyatt.  they got me good.  don't let 'em get you too.
will somebody get the damn dog out-
remember about the light you're supposed to see when you're dyin'?
easy morg, don't think about that now.
isn't true.  i can't see a damn thing.
no, no, get away, get away from me...
wyatt...
i want you to know it's over. we're leaving and we're not coming back.
well... 'bye.
hey, you smell that?  smells like something died.
oh, jesus, johnny...
way ahead of you, wyatt.  you want us to help you get ike clanton and johnny behan.  everybody knows they're the ones to blame for your brothers.
they're nothing.  they're nobody. i want the cowboys.  all of 'em.  i mean to break 'em up, drive 'em out of the territory.
are you out of your mind?  what on earth'd make us-
i'll pay you 500 each in advance and i'll mount you on those.
got a sheaf of federal warrants. being in the territories it's up to our discretion how they're served.  that means we got the cowboys without quarter.  the black flag, brother.  no prisoners, no mercy, amen.
500... year's wages.  and i never even saw a horse like that.
i ain't your brother, i ain't none of your damn brothers.  move!
all right, run 'em off.
it appears he missed an excellent chance to keep his mouth shut.
felt his liver go on that last one.  get him to a doctor or he'll be dead in a couple hours.
florentino!  he's getting away!
drop his horse.
you know, we might just pull this off.
not so sure.  somethin' tells me it gets harder from here in.  should've held out for more money.
i know that cut.  you mean there's a waterhole near there?
but this time they'll be ready.
we'll see about that.
what'd you do that for?
so he can tell the story.
don't touch me!
sorry...
you really look awful.
not half as bad as i feel.
then why in hell're you doin' this?  you ought to be in bed.
wyatt earp is my friend.
hell, i got lot's of friends.
i don't.
maybe you ought to have a talk with doc, wyatt.  i don't know if he's gonna make it.
there's no reasoning with him.
next waterhole's black draw.  we could be there by mid-morning.
they're wise by now.  which is next, iron springs?  yeah, let's try there, iron springs.
there they are.  no herd though.
we'll go around that way, come up on foot.
no.
what?
no.
look at that!  yeah!  come and get some, boy!
no...
let me, let me, yeah!  die, you bastard...
no...
wyatt, my god!  you're shot to pieces!
no...
yeah, better run, you bastards!
how is he?
i don't believe it.  he's clean!
what?  but i saw 'em-
i'm telling you, there isn't a mark on him.
i'm a man without fear, wyatt.  i literally don't care if i live or die.  but even i can't fight human instinct.  somebody suddenly starts shooting at me, i duck. but you... what on earth were you thinking about?
i don't know.  it all happened so fast.  if i'd had a chance to think about it i guess i probably would've been scared but... swear to god, doc, i just don't know.
hey creek, you ever see anything like that before?
never even heard of anything like it.
talked it over.  we decided we don't need the money.  took out 13 dollars each, though.  federal posseman's fee.  that all right?
sure...
doc...
don't touch me, god damn it!  just don't touch me!  come on...
sorry about your friend.  and i'm sorry about...
i forgave you the moment you said it.
you did.  well... thank you.
i have to go.
wait!
see how she breezed out of here. like she had wings.  funny thing but i can't really remember how she looked.  i can remember parts of her clear as crystal, her mouth, her walk, how she shut her eyes when she laughed, little bits and pieces, but not the whole package.  can't put it together for some reason.
good god, you're really-
cards in spades.  i'm in love with every second of her life.  hell, i'll probably love her when i'm dust.
we should get moving.
doc's just in no kinda shape.
i don't like it.
might as well hear him out. anyways, what choice we got?  but no matter what happens, see it through to the end.  if you don't i'll curse the day i ever laid eyes on you.
well hello, sherm.
you wanted to talk?
yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you'd join back up with us.
that what you got me up here for?
you're a cowboy, you're a brother.  come back, no hard feelings.
forget it, ringo.
isn't there anything i can say that'll change your mind?  you're gonna stay with your new friends?
'least they don't scare women.
you're the boss.  one thing, though.
you tell ringo... just tell him i'll be there.
wyatt, are you crazy?
i made a promise.
wyatt, listen, you can't beat him.  you're good and god knows you got the courage, but you ain't in ringo's class.  hell, he's the best that's ever been. 'cept maybe for wild bill.
he's right, wyatt.  ringo could put five into you before you could even get one into him.
but i'd do it, i'd get that one into him.  so help me god, i would.
all right wyatt, maybe you can. but you gotta die to do it. understand?  you gotta die!
what makes a man like ringo, doc? what makes him do the things he does?
a man like ringo's got a great empty hole right through the middle of him and no matter what he does he can't ever fill it.  he can't kill enough or steal enough or inflict enough pain to ever fill it.  and it drives him mad. sick mad.  cold and dirty.
so what does he want?
what does he want?  he wants revenge.
revenge?  for what?
i'm sorry.  i'm sorry, wyatt.  god, i'm so sorry.
that's all right, doc.  don't worry.
never got to wear one of those.
wyatt, i... i ain't got the words.
i know.  me neither.
why johnny ringo, you look like somebody just walked over your grave.  oh, i wasn't quite as sick as i made out.
my fight's not with you, holliday.
i beg to differ.  we started a fight we never got to finish. play for blood, remember?
i was kidding about that.
all right, lunger.  let's do it.
say when.
praise jesus!
i'll be dipped in shit.  i will, too.
all right, what's it to be?  new mexico's that way.
colorado's closer
so're the cowboys.  they're up that road right now, waiting to jump us.
we're the law, ain't we?  well the law don't ride around vermin-
it rides right at 'em.  like mcmasters said, see it through to the end.
well hell, wyatt.  wyatt, i want you to meet father feeney.  father feeney's just been initiating me into the mysteries of the great and ancient church of rome.  you see, it appears my hypocrisy knows no bounds.
how you feelin', doc?
rather an obvious question under the circumstances, don't you agree?  a better one might be how do you feel?
hurts.  hurts pretty bad.
i imagine it would, yes.  so now we can add self-pity to your list of frailties.
all right, doc...
you think i'm kidding.  you're the most fallible, wrong-headed, self- deluding, just generally benighted jackass i've ever known.  yet, withal, even at your worst, you're the only human being in my entire life who ever gave me hope.
all i ever wanted was to live a normal life.
when will you wake up?  you wouldn't know a normal life if it bit you in the ass.
that's great coming from you.
i played the cards i was dealt, wyatt.  your problem is you're always trying to play someone else's.  allow me to tell you the truth and thus set you free: there is no happiness, wyatt there is no normal life.  there's only life, that's all.  just life. the rest is relative.
then what do i do?
first you can grab that black- haired woman and make her your own.
all right.  then what?
run.  take that girl and start running.  run and don't look back. all your life you been running and looking back and just barely existing and calling it getting by.  this time run and don't look back and call it living.  live every second, live it right up to the hilt.  live, wyatt...  live for me.
wyatt!  my god...
did you ever see the sun come up over the rockies?  it hits all of a sudden and below there's california and you swear you're looking at heaven.
i have nothing left.  i have nothing to give you.  i have no pride, no dignity, no money.  i don't even know how we'll make a living.  but i promise i'll love you every second of your life.
don't worry, wyatt.  my family's rich.
