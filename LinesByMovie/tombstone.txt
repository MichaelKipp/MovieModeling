what did the messican mean, a sick horse's going to get us?  did not make no sense.
he was quoting the bible, revelations: "behold a pale horse and the one that sat on him was death and hell followed with him."
well now that is a little more like it.
forget it.
excuse me?
i said forget it, answer's no, i do not want the job and that is final.  I am going to tombstone and nothin' short of dyin's gonn stop me.  good day.
but wait, you do not understand-
no marshal, you do not understand. I am through with lawing, I am through with the whole proposition.  forever.  i did my duty, now I would like to get on with my life.  that is if you do not mind.  jesus.  good day now.
i see, off to strike it rich, huh.  all right, fine, wish you luck.  tell you this though, never was a rich man yet did not wind up with a guilty conscience.
already got a guilty conscience, might as well have the money too.
well how do we look?
hey!  virgil!  my god!  morgan!  hey, boy!  you look great!  both of you!
allie-girl...and louisa!  you are so lovely.  I am at your feet, darlin'.  just at your feet.  guess it is only right.  ma always said you were the prettiest.
but she doted on the frowner
wyatt, i could not find a single store that had laudanum any-
mattie, they are here!  folks this is celia ann but you can call her mattie.  or even mrs.  earp if you prefer.
give him some good exercise?  sure some stud.  some string in fact. what are you going to do, race 'em?
hope so.  clean up with this boy.
come up to the fire, honey.
i think I will just lie down awhile
long as i live I will never get used to that sound.
they are just lonely is all.  hell, i howl myself sometimes.
you get lonely?
look at that.  busted.  brand new money ward, too.  33 years old and i do not even have a decent watch.  'bout time i started lookin' out for myself.
well here we are a family again. been so long plain forgot how good it feels.  want to thank you for that, wyatt.  all your doin'.
we are going to do it, boys.  going to get ours.  feel it in my bones. all we have to do is keep our eyes on that brass ring.
boy, look at all those stars.  bet you can see every star there is. practical touch 'em.  kinda makes you think, you know?  i mean you look up and you think god made all that but he still remembered to make a little speck like me. kinda flattering really.  hey, wyatt, you believe in god?  no, come on, really, do you?
maybe, yeah.  hell, i do not know.
well what do you think happens when you die?
got me.  somethin'.  nothin'.  i do not know.
i read this book, book on spiritualism...
really?  what about hell?  they got a sign or what?
hey, wyatt, god damn it, I am serious!
well that is your problem.  hey virge, see anything of doc while you were in prescott?
hit a streak when we left.  him and kate.
i said that is 500 to you, holliday.  in or out?
500? sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
here, doc.
bless you, darling  darling!  are you mad?  you are not wearing a bustle.  how lewd!
oh, for christ's sake!
ed bailey, you look like you are just ready to burst.  well call me a fool but i guess I will just have to call.  cover your ears, darling.
god damn son of a...
is not that a daisy?
just pick up your money and go. sick of listening to you simper.
now ed, are we cross?
skinny lunger, your guns do not impress me.  was not for those guns you would be nothin'.
why ed, what an ugly thing to say!  does this mean you are not my friend anymore?  you know, ed, if i thought you were not my friend i do not think i could bear it.
oh, my god...
does it hurt?  a lot?  good.
i calculate that is the end of this town.  and let's do not bother about the luggage, darling.
i been having the boy at the hotel pack us up every night since your streak started
newcomers, eh?  names john behan, I am cochise county sheriff.  just hit town?
just this minute.  I am wyatt earp, these are my brothers-
wyatt earp...dodge city, right?
gave all that up.  going into business.
well I am the man to see.  besides sheriff I am also tax collector, captain of the fire brigade, and chairman of the non-partisan anti- chinese league.  a man of many parts.  got a place to stay yet?  i also sit on the townlot commission.  got a couple of lovely cottages coming up for rent.  here, let me show you...
wyatt, meet fred white, he is town marshal.
lotta law around here.  just met the sheriff.
look pretty rough.
just like any other hard cases. got to know how to handle 'em.
what about all these saloons?
ah, now that is the real mother- lode in tombstone.  up and down allen street, full-blast 24 hours a day, liquor, hostesses, gamblin', makin' money hand over fist.  all except the oriental.  on account of the element.  have a man for breakfast in there most days.  regular slaughter house. high-rollers will not go near it. too bad, nice place.
what can i get you?
let me have one of those cigars.  kinda nice in here.  you run it?
milt joyce, owner-operator.
well, excuse me for askin', milt, but is not it kinda dead in here?
you see that bird at the faro table?  that is johnny tyler.  he barged in here one day, said he was takin' over the game, started slappin' customer, wavin' his gun around, scarin' off all the high-class play.  only trade comes in here now's just bummers and drovers, just the dregs.
why do not you get rid of him and get yourself straight dealer?
well sure, neighbor, easy to say.
you back that queen again, you son of a bitch, I will blow you right out of that chair!  somethin' on your mind?
just wanted to let you know you are sitting in my chair.
that a fact?
yeah.  it is a fact.
for a man that do not go heeled you run your mouth kinda reckless.
do not need to go heeled to get the bulge on a dub like you.
that a fact?
yeah.  it is a fact.
well I am real scared.
go ahead.  skin it.  skin that smoke wagon and see what happens.
listen mister, I am getting' tired-
well we are off and running.  just acquired us a quarter-interest in the game at the oriental.
acquired?
so to speak.
doc!  how the hell are you?
perfect, wyatt.  simply perfect.
since when is faro a business?
did not you always say gambling's an honest trade?
i said poker's an honest trade. only suckers buck the tiger.  the odds are all with the house.
depends how you look at it.  i mean it is not like anybody's holding a gun to their heads.
that is what i love about wyatt. he can talk himself into anything.
sheriff behan, doc holliday.
forgive me if i do not shake hands.
so how is tombstone treating you?
fine, fine.  but i was thinkin', you know what this town really needs is a race track.
actually, you know, that is not a bad idea, send a signal we are growing up.
very cosmopolitan.
i know him.  that is creek johnson.
easy, gents. private affair...  wyatt! doc! hey!
jack...
hello, wyatt!  hiya doc!
what was that all about?
drunks.  crawfished a bet, called him a liar.  i saw the whole thing.
sheriff, may i present a pair of fellow sophisticates, turkey creek jack johnson and texas jack vermillion?  watch your ear, creek.
very instructive
but who was the devil?
it is that woman from the coach!
I will be damned...
her maiden name was sullivan.
better go with 'em, honey.  here's where i leave you.
no, stay.  please stay with me.
honey, i got to start makin' money.
oh, all right.
well i guess i do not have to go right now.  i guess i could stay a little while.
no, no, i do not want to keep you.
no really, i can stay a while.
just go.  it is all right.  wyatt, really.  work well.
all right, well, good night.
all right, I am on fire!  black seven, seven stickin' spades. let's go!
I am your man...  you win again.  well played, sir. you are on fire.
told you.  I am red hot, I am blazin'!  now, red seven.  seven stinkin' diamonds.  look out!  five thousand!  let's go!
awful lot of money.
can not take the heat, get outta the kitchen.
you are the doctor.  sad news, friend.
damn!  all right, wait a minute...
so now we are in the mining business.  turning into regular tycoons.  going to call this one the mattie blaylock.  mattie'll get a kick out of that, it is her maiden name.
and what a maiden, pure as the driven snow, I am sure.
hey doc!  come on now.
just his style, morg.  does not mean anything.
so tell me, wyatt.  I am curious. do you actually consider youself a married man?  forsaking all others?
well yeah.  pretty much.  i mean i was no angel when we met but people change doc.  i mean sooner or later you gotta grow up.
i see.  and what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? wyatt "she"?
you know damn well who i mean. that dusky-hued lady satan.
i do not know.  probably ignore her.
ignore her?
I would ignore her.  people can change, doc.
I will remember you said that.
satisfied?
i stand corrected.  wyatt.  you are an oak.
I am retired.
good.  that is real good.
shut up, ike.
and you must be doc holliday.
that is the rumor.
you retired, too?
not me.  I am in my prime.
yeah, you look it.
and you must be ringo.  look, darling, johnny ringo.  the deadliest pistoleer since wild bill, they say.  what do you think, darling?  should i hate him?
you do not even know him.
yes, but there is just something about him.  something around the eyes, i do not know, reminds me of... me.  no.  I am sure of it, i hate him.
he is drunk.
in vino veritas.
age quod agis.
credat judaeus apella.
ecentus stultorum magister.
in pace requiescat.
see what i mean about it getting spooky?
curly bill, huh?  who was that other idiot?
ike clanton, old man's eldest son.  know he am not got the stuff, makes him miserable.
yeah, and dangerous.
the man dealing faro.  who is he?
that is wyatt earp.  made quite a name for himself as a peace officer in kansas.
a peace officer... impressive man
yes, very.  and very married.
oh, so that is it...
that is my lovin' man.  just can not get enough.
enough?  never.
hey, is that "old dog tray"? sounds like "old dog tray".
what?
you know, stephen foster.  "oh, susanna".  "camptown races", stephen-stinkin'-foster!
i see, well this happens to be a nocturne.
a which?
you know, frederic-fucking-chopin.
why do not you just leave it alone?
no, i got to do something.  i do not suppose you would card-
none of my business, fred.
maybe i ought to go out there.
you will or you won't.  do not look to me.  I am going to sleep.
he said to turn loose of him.
well I am not so go home.
come on, you...
crack me back of the head like some stinkin' bull.  hell, you am not no fightin' man, you are just a cop.
keep your eye on that brass ring. do not let anything side-track you.
i know, i need a keeper.
well i guess you can see, never a dull moment.  maybe you should stay around to see what happens next.  who know?  you might find a future here.
maybe even my destiny.
you know, i was thinkin', maybe we ought to open our own place. that is the real money.  build it up, milk it for all it is worth, then sell it off for a bundle and breeze out of this burg with more money than croesus and ready to live like kings.  let's you and me take a walk around town, virge, see if we can scout us out a couple of nice lots.
i can not hardly believe it.  it is working out just like you said, wyatt.  we are lootin' this burg six ways through sunday.
pretty fun too, is not it?
kinda, actually, yeah.  i gotta admit.
i could not help it, wyatt.  i looked at that woman and it was just like somebody slapping me in the face.  i mean these people're afraid to even walk down the street and I am trying to make money off it like some kind of god damn vulture.  that is not me, that is somebody i do not even know.
virgil, please.  do not do this to me.
it is got nothin' to do with you, wyatt.  it's-
nothing to do with me?  I am your brother for christ's sake.  god, i do not believe this.  talk to him, will you?  or hit him.  oh no, do not tell me...
listen to me, both of you.  this is no good.  this is trouble we do not need.  for the first time in our lives we got a chance to stop wandering and finally be a family.  do this and you throw it all away.  you saw what happened to fred white.
come on, we are not about pickin' fights.  just going to keep a little order, that is all.
yeah?
like you said, just got to know how to handle 'em.  old fred was not up to it.  we know that we are doin', wyatt.
all right, say you are right, say you do not get yourself killed. there is something else.  it is too late for virge, he already rolled his bone.  but it is not too late for you, morg.
what are you talkin' about?
run for your lives, boys!  it is that great two-gun dog-catcher from kansas!
mcmasters, is not it?  listen, you seen a black stallion with-
look, i got a rule.  i do not talk to lawmen.  dog-catchers neither.
I am not a lawman, I am just a private citizen getting' my property back
well in that case, i saw your horse.  billy clanton was takin' him up to the cut to show him off.  the boys're all up there right now, branding.  and in a mood.  still want your property back, mr. private citizen?
so what about you cowboys anyway?
if i had to explain it you would not understand.  just say we are brothers to the bone.
yeah, but some of the things they say your brothers've done...
there is all kinds of horses, am not there?  same with cowboys. what they do's their affair.  i do not preach and i do not judge.  i am not no dog-catcher.
where did you get that horse?
beauty, am not he?
i asked where you got him.
where do you think?  i stole him.
look, i do not want any trouble with you but that is my horse and i mean to have him back.  one way or another.
come and get him.
look kid, i know what it is like, i was a kid, too.  even stole a horse once.  but you can't--
feel bad about old fred.  just can not hold back when I am feelin' woolly.  still, feel kinda bad. but now we are square.  anyway no use for holdin' a grudge.  i deserved a rap in the head.
make you a deal.  my brother took over the marshal's office in tombstone.  got it in his head he is going to make the place safe for widows and orphans.  you and your boys stay out of his way, I will make sure he stays out of yours.
fair enough.  you know i got to admit, you got a lot of bark on you comin' up here like this.
they were all gonna jump me back there.  what ever happened to one against one?
am not our way.  we go all on one, one on all.  fight one of us, you fight us all.  that is the cowboy way.
and how come you call yourselves cowboys?  cowhands ride for the brand.
oh, we ride for a brand all right.  this brand.  how 'bout you?
this brand.
we are going to get along just fine.
maybe i jumped the gun.  maybe those cowboys are not near as bad as they are painted.  you know i was thinkin', there is a lot of money in the cattle business...
wait a minute, you thinkin' of getting in bed with the cowboys?
business is business.  do not have to love 'em to work with 'em.  not if there is money in it.
you are the one, wyatt.  you sure are.
we have never actually met.  my name's-
wyatt earp, i know.  i was beginning to think we would never meet.  this is fortuitous.  that means lucky.
i know what it means.
what is it?
easy now... that mare's in season.
oh...  now she is starting.  how do they know?
they know.  it is the scent.  we better split 'em up.
i have a better idea, let's run it out of them!
that was lovely!
you know you almost got us both killed back there?
fun though, was not it?
you would die for fun?
would not you?  you are laughing!  i was sure you never laughed.
i laugh sometimes
yes, but how often?  tell me, are you happy?
am i happy?  i do not know.  happy as the next man, i guess.  i do not laugh all day long like an idiot, if that is what you mean.
you are a little touchy about it.
I am not touchy, i just, it is a silly question, that is all.  am i happy?  are you happy?
of course, I am always happy. unless I am bored.  that blonde woman, is that your wife?
what about her?
nothing... tell me, what do you want out of life?
where do you get these questions?
just answer.
i do not know, make some money, have some kids, you know.
does not suit you.
how would you know?
just doesn't, that is all.
well i ought to know my own mind and I am tellin' you what suits me is a family and kids.  that suits me right down to the ground.  in fact, that is my idea of heaven.  all right, what is your idea of heaven?
room service.
see?  you are laughing again.  but that is what i want.  go places and move and never look back and just have fun.  forever.  that is my idea of heaven.  need someone to share it with, though.
you mean behan?  then why are you with him?
well he is handsome and he is charming.  he is all right.  for now.  do not say it, i know, I am rotten.  i can not help it.  I have tried to be good but it is too boring.
the way you talk.  never heard a woman talk like that.
oh look, i have not got time to be proper, i want to live.  I am a woman, i like men.  if that is unladylike then i guess I am not a lady.  at least I am honest.
well you are different, no arguing that.  but you are a lady all right. I will take my oath on it.
what is wrong?
i do not know, does not make any sense.  i almost can not look at you.  like it hurts.
i know, me too.  what should we do about it?
you know this is adultery.  you burn in hell for that.
then let's make sure we get our money's worth
i must say this certainly has been an unexpected little windfall.
fortuitous even.
and i do not even know your full name.
easy to fix.  wyatt berry stapp earp.
and I am josephine sarah marcus. my friends call me josie.
josie... no, I am going to call you sadie.
i hate sadie.
well you will always be sadie to me.
always?
getting late.  we better get back.
so i assume we are regarding this as just a kind of interlude.
look, it is too much of a tangle. i already cast my lot.  i can not go back and i can not sneak, feel back enough as it is.
you feel bad about this?  about me?
i did not mean it that way.
you know you do not have to sneak. you could stay with me.  i know things, wyatt.  sweet things.  i could make you so happy.
i can't, I am sorry.  forgive me.
that the bottle lou gave you? better go easy on that stuff.
i know what I am doing.  where have you been?
out ridin'.  so... how you doin'?
i do not know.  I am all right.
really?  you sure?
sure I am sure.  what is this?
well, i was thinking, we have already made a pile of money. maybe we should just pull up stakes and move on.  and we could stay on the move, you know?  just keep going, see the world.  live on room service the rest of our lives.  how did that be?
wyatt, what are you talkin' about?
just thinkin' out loud.  forget it.
doc will not quit, been up 36 hours. clanton came in an hour ago, they switched over to poker.  tried to get him to bed but he just will not let go.
i know.  and nobody can make him.
wyatt!  just in time.  pull up a chair.
been hittin' it awful hard, doc.
nonsense, i have not yet begun to defile myself.
but doc-
i will not be pawed at, thank you very much
sorry, sorry...
what d'you think of the singer?
nice voice.
that is not what i meant.
i saw that look on your face just now. what is between you and wyatt?
absolutely nothing.
what is wrong, doc?
nothing.  not a thing.  I am right as the mail.
how you feeling, doc?
better.
that is good.  i knew it was not nothin'.
we must talk, darling.  it appears we have to... redefine the nature of our association.
what is that mean, doc?  you know i do not understand when you talk up high like that.  you mean you do not want to be my lovin' man no more?
not exactly...
I am a good woman to you, doc. do not i always take care of you? nobody cares for you like me.  I am a good woman.
yes, i know.  you are a good woman.
billy clanton, wes fuller, and billy claiborne.  now there is six of 'em.  this is like a bad dream.
just stay calm, use your head. it will be all right.  just the same, though...  guess you better swear me in.
thought you swore you would never carry that thing again.
yeah, well, i swore a lot of things.
here they are again.  look at 'em.
easy, virge, they are just tryin' to egg us on.
those cowboys're tellin' everybody in town they are going to clean you out.  they are down in that lot right now behind the ok corral.
do not worry, doc, it is not your problem. you do not have to mix up in this.
wait till the liquor wears off. once they start getting headaches they will lose interest.
wyatt, they are threatening our lives.
you will never make that stick.
they are carrying guns in town.
virge, that is a misdemeanor.  you go down there to arrest 'em, something goes wrong, maybe this time somebody gets his head broke, suddenly it is a mess and it will not end there, you will have cowboys comin' around lookin' for trouble from here to christmas. you going to risk all that over a misdemeanor?
no, damn it, it is wrong, they are breakin' the law.
all right, virge, your call.  but give doc the shotgun.  they will be less apt to get nervy if they see him on the street howitzer.
there they go.  look kinda like preachers.
yeah.  or undertakers.
virge, you are makin' the arrest. you make contact, I will back you up.  morgan'll back me up, doc'll keep an eye out for trouble.  and keep your hands on your guns. they even look like they are going to start something, buffalo 'em. right over the head.
wyatt, i know what I am doin'.
look at 'em all.  they love it. how in the hell'd we get ourselves into this?
I am sorry.  if there was any other-
i know.  just did what you had to. that banner and stuff, that is just ike.  do not worry about it.
how you doin', boy?
fine.  better.
you were right.  it is nothin' like i thought.  i almost wish...
i know, kid.  i know.  me too.
mattie.  what about this?
i need it.
'least you admit it.
admit what, I am an opium fiend? no, wyatt, i just said i need it. i need something to keep me warm at night.
look, mattie, i know you're-
you know nothing.  what you do not know would fill a book.  jesus, i feel like it is when you are around i need it most.  you are never yourself, you never relax.  never. everything's so stiff and dead. you always have to keep a rein on everything, ever yourself.  oh, you smile sometimes, I have even seen you laugh.  but there is no light in your smile for me, wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. and i get cold, wyatt.  i get so cold.  what is between you and that jew woman?
all right, look.  i can make it right, i can make this up to you, mattie.  i can, i swear.
will you go to her and tell her right in front of me she is nothing to you?  right out loud so i can hear?  tell her she is nothing, tell her she is nobody, just dirt?  will you do that?
listen, i want to talk to you.
not now.  i do not have time.
i saw that look pass between you and wyatt at the fight.  listen to me!  you are mine!  understand? you are my woman and I am your man.
my man?  you told wyatt you would disarmed those men.  do you actually believe after that i could see you as my man?  you are just a dirty little fixer.
you whore!  you filthy whore!
dropped him, that was it.  sorry if i made a worse mess for you.
I am the one made a mess.  made a right fair mess of the whole thing.
that is just my game.
all right, lunger.  have at it.
on three?  you call it.
here it come: one-two-
i want them spitting blood!
easy, johnny.  now am not the time.  i tell you, boys, even I am worried what will happen once ringo runs this outfit!  god have mercy!
there is no god, there is no devil, i hate the god damn world!  i want to die!
easy, son.  you just need to get your feet back under you, that is all.  come on, boy, let's kick south.  down to the old playground.
easy.  i just wanted to tell you things're about to start changing around here.  lots of so-called hard cases and tough-nuts swagger around this town but none of 'em's got a clue about the real play.  none of 'em.
i do not understand.
you will after tonight.  bet on it.
getting late.  guess I will turn in.
bundle up, virge.  cold out there.
that thunder's sure somethin'.
that did not sound like thunder.
virgil?
wyatt...
no, wait.  please.  i know nothin' i say'll fix things but i want you to know it was not me.
no?  brothers to the bone, right?
not anymore, not after this.
get down, boy.
morgan, are you crazy?  they are out gunning for us!  what the hell're you doin'?
what is it look like?  they want a piece of me they can come and get it, I am not crawlin' into my hole.
morg, use your head.
i am usin' it, wyatt.  been wonderin' how the hell we got in this tangle.  you know they hit clum's house, too?  shot up his wife. his wife.  who ever heard of that?  men sneakin' around in the dark, back-shootin', scarin' women?  they are bugs, wyatt.  you know all your smart talk about live and let live?  am not no live and let live with bugs.
i know, i was wrong.  but morg, look, we got to get out.
listen to yourself, wyatt.  lie down and crawl or you might get hurt?  what kinda talk is that? that is virgil lyin' over there, wyatt.  our own brother.  ruined for life.  no sir, i am not going no place.  you want to go, fine. I am stayin' right here and have it out with those bastards.
i just got it fixed.
you are on.
you were right, wyatt.  they got me good.  do not let 'em get you too.
will somebody get the damn dog out-
remember about the light you are supposed to see when you are dyin'?
easy morg, do not think about that now.
is not true.  i can not see a damn thing.
no, no, get away, get away from me...
wyatt...
i want you to know it is over. we are leaving and we are not coming back.
well... 'bye.
hey, you smell that?  smells like something died.
oh, jesus, johnny...
way ahead of you, wyatt.  you want us to help you get ike clanton and johnny behan.  everybody knows they are the ones to blame for your brothers.
they are nothing.  they are nobody. i want the cowboys.  all of 'em.  i mean to break 'em up, drive 'em out of the territory.
are you out of your mind?  what on earth'd make us-
I will pay you 500 each in advance and I will mount you on those.
got a sheaf of federal warrants. being in the territories it is up to our discretion how they are served.  that means we got the cowboys without quarter.  the black flag, brother.  no prisoners, no mercy, amen.
500... year's wages.  and i never even saw a horse like that.
i am not your brother, i am not none of your damn brothers.  move!
all right, run 'em off.
it appears he missed an excellent chance to keep his mouth shut.
felt his liver go on that last one.  get him to a doctor or he will be dead in a couple hours.
florentino!  he is getting away!
drop his horse.
you know, we might just pull this off.
not so sure.  somethin' tells me it gets harder from here in.  should have held out for more money.
i know that cut.  you mean there is a waterhole near there?
but this time they will be ready.
we will see about that.
what did you do that for?
so he can tell the story.
do not touch me!
sorry...
you really look awful.
not half as bad as i feel.
then why in hell're you doin' this?  you ought to be in bed.
wyatt earp is my friend.
hell, i got lot's of friends.
i don't.
maybe you ought to have a talk with doc, wyatt.  i do not know if he is going to make it.
there is no reasoning with him.
next waterhole's black draw.  we could be there by mid-morning.
they are wise by now.  which is next, iron springs?  yeah, let's try there, iron springs.
there they are.  no herd though.
we will go around that way, come up on foot.
no.
what?
no.
look at that!  yeah!  come and get some, boy!
no...
let me, let me, yeah!  die, you bastard...
no...
wyatt, my god!  you are shot to pieces!
no...
yeah, better run, you bastards!
how is he?
i do not believe it.  he is clean!
what?  but i saw 'em-
I am telling you, there is not a mark on him.
I am a man without fear, wyatt.  i literally do not care if i live or die.  but even i can not fight human instinct.  somebody suddenly starts shooting at me, i duck. but you... what on earth were you thinking about?
i do not know.  it all happened so fast.  if I would had a chance to think about it i guess i probably would have been scared but... swear to god, doc, i just do not know.
hey creek, you ever see anything like that before?
never even heard of anything like it.
talked it over.  we decided we do not need the money.  took out 13 dollars each, though.  federal posseman's fee.  that all right?
sure...
doc...
do not touch me, god damn it!  just do not touch me!  come on...
sorry about your friend.  and I am sorry about...
i forgave you the moment you said it.
you did.  well... thank you.
i have to go.
wait!
see how she breezed out of here. like she had wings.  funny thing but i can not really remember how she looked.  i can remember parts of her clear as crystal, her mouth, her walk, how she shut her eyes when she laughed, little bits and pieces, but not the whole package.  can not put it together for some reason.
good god, you are really-
cards in spades.  I am in love with every second of her life.  hell, I will probably love her when I am dust.
we should get moving.
doc's just in no kinda shape.
i do not like it.
might as well hear him out. anyways, what choice we got?  but no matter what happens, see it through to the end.  if you do not I will curse the day i ever laid eyes on you.
well hello, sherm.
you wanted to talk?
yeah, kinda, wanted to see if you would join back up with us.
that what you got me up here for?
you are a cowboy, you are a brother.  come back, no hard feelings.
forget it, ringo.
is not there anything i can say that will change your mind?  you are going to stay with your new friends?
'least they do not scare women.
you are the boss.  one thing, though.
you tell ringo... just tell him I will be there.
wyatt, are you crazy?
i made a promise.
wyatt, listen, you can not beat him.  you are good and god knows you got the courage, but you am not in ringo's class.  hell, he is the best that is ever been. 'cept maybe for wild bill.
he is right, wyatt.  ringo could put five into you before you could even get one into him.
but I would do it, I would get that one into him.  so help me god, i would.
all right wyatt, maybe you can. but you gotta die to do it. understand?  you gotta die!
what makes a man like ringo, doc? what makes him do the things he does?
a man like ringo's got a great empty hole right through the middle of him and no matter what he does he can not ever fill it.  he can not kill enough or steal enough or inflict enough pain to ever fill it.  and it drives him mad. sick mad.  cold and dirty.
so what does he want?
what does he want?  he wants revenge.
revenge?  for what?
I am sorry.  I am sorry, wyatt.  god, I am so sorry.
that is all right, doc.  do not worry.
never got to wear one of those.
wyatt, i... i am not got the words.
i know.  me neither.
why johnny ringo, you look like somebody just walked over your grave.  oh, i was not quite as sick as i made out.
my fight's not with you, holliday.
i beg to differ.  we started a fight we never got to finish. play for blood, remember?
i was kidding about that.
all right, lunger.  let's do it.
say when.
praise jesus!
I will be dipped in shit.  i will, too.
all right, what is it to be?  new mexico's that way.
colorado's closer
so're the cowboys.  they are up that road right now, waiting to jump us.
we are the law, am not we?  well the law do not ride around vermin-
it rides right at 'em.  like mcmasters said, see it through to the end.
well hell, wyatt.  wyatt, i want you to meet father feeney.  father feeney's just been initiating me into the mysteries of the great and ancient church of rome.  you see, it appears my hypocrisy knows no bounds.
how you feelin', doc?
rather an obvious question under the circumstances, do not you agree?  a better one might be how do you feel?
hurts.  hurts pretty bad.
i imagine it would, yes.  so now we can add self-pity to your list of frailties.
all right, doc...
you think I am kidding.  you are the most fallible, wrong-headed, self- deluding, just generally benighted jackass I have ever known.  yet, withal, even at your worst, you are the only human being in my entire life who ever gave me hope.
all i ever wanted was to live a normal life.
when will you wake up?  you would not know a normal life if it bit you in the ass.
that is great coming from you.
i played the cards i was dealt, wyatt.  your problem is you are always trying to play someone else's.  allow me to tell you the truth and thus set you free: there is no happiness, wyatt there is no normal life.  there is only life, that is all.  just life. the rest is relative.
then what do i do?
first you can grab that black- haired woman and make her your own.
all right.  then what?
run.  take that girl and start running.  run and do not look back. all your life you been running and looking back and just barely existing and calling it getting by.  this time run and do not look back and call it living.  live every second, live it right up to the hilt.  live, wyatt...  live for me.
wyatt!  my god...
did you ever see the sun come up over the rockies?  it hits all of a sudden and below there is california and you swear you are looking at heaven.
i have nothing left.  i have nothing to give you.  i have no pride, no dignity, no money.  i do not even know how we will make a living.  but i promise I will love you every second of your life.
do not worry, wyatt.  my family's rich.
