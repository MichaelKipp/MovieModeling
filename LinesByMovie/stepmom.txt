you forgot to wash my purple shirt.  i told you a hundred times it was purple day at school today.
i did not forget.  i was up all night thinking about it and i concluded you are too special to look like everyone else.  orange red.  that is your color.  few can carry it off.  now please.  help me find your brother.
you lost ben?!
of course not.  does he look lost to you?  bennnnn!!!
no.  i told you.  i like apple butter not butter butter.
here.
never mind.  I will just eat my lunch.
I am almost done making it.  alright ben -- you deal with the tardy, you write yourself a note, your daddy told you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were aaaagggghhhh!
oh my god.  that is so not funny.  you are late.  you are really late.  now get out here and have some cereal.
no.
fine!  eat in the cupboard.
no!  cocoa puffs on top -- fruit loops on the bottom.
fine.
you touched it.
then have a donut --
no.
alright starve.
I am going to beep daddy at work.
he is badgering a witness.  eat.
but you told us to starve.
hello?...duncan...the ad agency's already there?...i'm out the door...  ben!  knock it off!  it is going to go beautifully...  damn it ben --
you swore.  you owe me a quarter.  did you remember my egg carton?  i told you i needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
absolutely duncan I am on top of everything.
...eggzactly.  I am putting on my coat --  we are late.  we are seriously late.  which means mister ben we have got to get you dressed --
no!
...it's really not so bad annabelle -- red and blue make purple.
i do not care.
i know you don't, but if you had, chrom- atically you are in the purple family.
why does rachel wear daddy's underpants? does not she have underpants of her own?
i noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps rachel's underpants are in there -- now where are your lunches?
annabelle sucked her thumb last night.
i never do that, you always lie!
never say 'never' -- it is not fair to say 'always' -- and no name calling. use your words.
i hate when you say that.
thank you.  those were all words.  i hate the planet uranus.  terrible name for a planet.
i hate snails and blue cheese. especially together.  hate.
i have lava.
lava's hateable.  i never thought of that.
i hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.
excellent point.
i hate wax lips and red ants and pretzels without salt...
i hate the crayon burnt sienna and people who spit when they walk.
cooper, back the fill off i do not have enough shadow...
you have got a fruit loop in your hair.
you say that like i do not know that.
i once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head --
and when did that pass?
actually, never.  they will always hate you.  there is a gene for it.
congratulations.  only forty minutes late.  you are handling this promotion really well rachel.
duncan.  my work is everything to me. this'll never happen again.  now stand back -- this session's going to make you remember why you hired me even though i would not sleep with you -- cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
planning on getting --
remarried.  there is no move.
are you here?
I am here.
because you do not really seem here.
I am here.  I have got a case where they are this close to sequestering the jury but have i answered the goddamn thing?!
something is up wi...
you think i did not get that?
I have been with someone for quite some time, and did not feel it was appropriate for her to move in too quickly.  but after a lot of thought and careful discussion with her -- and the kids i might add -- she moved in last month.
since our divorce luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he is now living with a woman half his age --
rachel's not half my age.
we are not discussing your age.
well, we are not discussing rachel's age either.
they want to be with you luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
jackie, they come to be part of my life.  rachel is part of that life.
napalm.
except for last thursday when rachel forgot to pick them up --
jackie, she was five minutes late --
thank you mrs. franklin.  jackie?  this has been very valuable for us.  and I will have a serious talk with annabelle tonight.
it is wednesday night.  she is at my house.  I will talk to her.
I will call from work.  we can have a conference call.
you tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
you ask me that counselor's making a mountain out of a molehill...
I am worried.
me too.
luke, i need to switch next friday for thursday, so why do not you take the weekend...  ...that way you will be there, and I will pick up monday, tuesday, and wednesday.
fine.  but i wanted to take the kids to work with me on wednesday so I will take wednesday, and you can pick up that thursday, friday after soccer, and saturday before riding.
easy enough.
good...well...take care.
i did not say that.  why would i say that?
well daddy and i were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
i do not want that to happen.  why would i want that to happen?
well you are telling your teachers and your friends --
mass hysteria.
maybe you are upset that rachel moved in.
I am not upset.  why would i be upset?
look if the truth is you do not feel like talking about this right now that is fine. but do not look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. cause there are only so many lies you are allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.  you wind up looking like...
like who?
well, he is not president anymore, so why be petty.
it just slipped out.
it happens.
what happens when he loves rachel more than us?
that will never happen.
never say never you always say that. I will bet daddy's mad at me now.
queen of diamonds.
seven of clubs.  nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
I am going to call him.
annabelle, daddy and i will always be there. that is one time always is always.  you can call him after dinner but...
poof!  you are happy now.
thank you ben.  annabelle!
okay, if they are going to have a sauce, put something in it besides flour and chicken broth...
it was a veal stock, i thi...
well, it was not a reduction like you do it!  boiling down half a ton of bones...
the way you cook.  if you could make love, I would marry you.
we have to talk.
uh-oh.  i mention marriage, all of a sudden...  ve haff to ta...
i did not want to spoil our supper...
you would rather spoil our walk home.
yeh, it is cheaper.
i just found out i have to go to boston to get a deposition.  i might not be back until saturday.
so I will have to order in?
we have the kids this weekend, so...
jesus.
anyway, i thought...while I am gone...maybe I will hire in some help.
for what?
just a babysitter -- i mean...you're working...
i can take them to work with me -- i can shift things around --
you do not need to.  i do not expect you to handle them yourself.
can not handle them myself is what you mean.  can't.
you do not trust me to be alone with them.
i trust you of course i do but --
but?  but what?
but you are not good at this.  not yet. I am sorry.
i know how responsible, caring adults parent children.  I am bribe 'em.  but 'em a dog or something.  maybe a doberman.
look.  i know they hate me.
they do not hate you --
and what you are telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
nobody's telling them to hate you --
really?  look in your ex-wife's eyes.
it is complicated for jackie.  it is complicated for me...you do not have kids -- you do not understand --
oh right...so it is just complicated for you and jackie -- for me it is pretty simple cause i just do not understand...
no you don't.  and I am not going to screw with my kids heads right now --
you know i do not need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot...your ex-wife's doing a bang up job and i have to face it every tuesday and thursday and every other goddamn weekend and i just do not know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long!  jesus what did you see in her?  i do not get it -- i just do not get it.
I am sorry, okay?  let's not fi...
do not touch me!  I am allergic to you!
&quot;those who travel far and near this will make you disappear!&quot;
i have to work on my video project! do not follow me!  i can put myself to bed.
excuse me --
annabelle let's get something clear.
i do not have to listen to you!  you are not my mother.
thank god for that!
what i meant and perhaps i did not say it well was you have a great mom.  you do not need another one.  but when you are at this house --
this is my daddy's house --
this is my house too!
and this is my room so get out!
i made you some cocoa.  see?
thank you ben.  that was so sweet of you.  goodnight annabelle.  sweet dreams.
&quot;in the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
are not you going to drink your cocoa? it is the good kind.
mmmm!  tasty.  you are a master chef ben. just like your dad.
&quot;goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight gracie -- goodnight ben!
no!  you are cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing i can not sleep otherwise.
&quot;in the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon...&quot;
&quot;and a picture of the cow jumping over the moon...&quot;
that is nice ben.
ben!  what is wrong?
i killed her!
how do you hold down a job?  it is 8:10. you were supposed to be here at 7:00. she is missed her sunrise groom'n ride.
this is friday, her riding lesson is on tuesdays.  i got it right here...
every tuesday except the 3rd tuesday of the month when it is switched to friday except in april when she rides on thursday.  it is not that hard.  did not you have a mother?
can i please have a cup of coffee?
we do not have any coffee.
what is this?  the betty ford center?
annabelle, how is your video rep...
what happened with annabelle?  has nothing i said gotten through to you?
maybe you could back off just a little bit --
what did you do?
nothing.  look, i want to talk to you about...well...luke said to ask you...
she is been talking about this little editing machine, it is only...
...a ridiculously expensive and inappropriate item, which her father and i have already told her she is far too young to own.  but you apparently want to buy her forgiveness, with...
forgiveness?  for what, exactly?
luke was in the shower this morning and annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
I am sure that did not upset her. everyone in our family takes showers.
i was in there in him.
did you or luke talk to her about it afterwards?
no.  i thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
you mean for you.  a 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  she sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. and you think it is best for her if every- one pretends it did not happen?  this is not going to work out.
you are damn right.  I am going to sick of your imperious bullshit.  i never said i was betty fucking crocker.  if every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third friday or the month -- go ahead!  i have a life!
oh and i do not because i have a children?! the problem is you are too self-involved to ever be a mother.
maybe the problem is your kids.  maybe they are spoiled, coddled brats!
get out!
but it is not on the schedule!
you got to hell!
now ladies, the secrets to a great pie is the crust.  and the secret to a great flaky pie crust comes from less flour and more...what?
ice cold water.
that is my girl...
get ready.  to get really mad.
uh.  annabelle's video report has been switched again.
not yet.
hey, i sold my body to satan to clear friday at two o'clo...
we have the kids.  next weekend.
and it is my call.  i promised them water-skiing, instead o...
our weekend.  at that sweet little b &amp; b.
machines do not eat message.
look, i...
of all the cheap excuses.  to break a child's heart.
just outside the big top, we are almo...
you are where?
at the big apple circus, it is the only big top i know.  i said I would get 'em back tonight...
jackie, we were taking them water- skiing for the whole weekend!
...until the plan changed, when jessie's mom gave us these tickets. what, rachel. 'forgot' i told her?
yeh?
think twice.  before you ever pull that again.
the timing was off -- i need this light.
just where i wanna be all saturd...
hold lunch!
but we are hungry -- and i have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  it starts at seven!
it is only one o'clock...why do not you get another fudgesicle -- I will be done soon -- really soon.
lunch time sleeping beauty.  where is ben?  is he in the bathroom?
i do not know...i feel like I am going to throw up.
what if he is kidnapped?
he is not kidnapped he is -- he is just hiding -- he is just -- bennnn?  goddammit!
ben!  oh my ben!  are you alright?
i knew where i was all the time.
i hate her.  i really hate her.
there you are!
do not take my picture!
annabelle does not really want to talk to you right now.
I am sorry i did not mean to break your concentration.  i thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
jackie, if i thought for one moment...
you listen carefully because i am only going to say this once.  that woman has nothing more to do with my children.
our children.
do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today?  how lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did?  he could have been...
but he hasn't.  he wandered off.  i know it is terrifying.  i can imagine how you felt when that call came -- but it happens.
not to me.
jackie, you have made mistakes -- we all make mistakes --
I am not going to wait around to see the next one.  I am not going to watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement.  I am seeing a lawyer.
jackie stop.  we promised we never go there.
we have broken a lot of promises, have not we luke?
why are you taking this out on him?
rache, get out of th...
you have not done one goddam thing to make any of this easier...
i am not here to make it easier for you.  these are my children.  they do not want to be with you.
well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
a court order is gonna say that woman is never alone with my children!  ever again!  do you hear that?
guinevere, godiva, i sense enemy sol...
i do not want to be lady godiva anymore, no matter how much i like chocolate.  i want to be a stud.
lord nelson, napoleon's troops.  i fear for the women and the property values.
I will ride ahead.  nelson, protect the queen...
mommy?  it is not rachel's fault i ran away.
no, that is your fault.  it is her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  which means, the most important job.
rachel's job is she works.
ben, mommies work too.  they work very hard.  mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  i just do not get paid.
does rachel make a lot of money?
people like rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
i think she is pretty, mommy.
yes...if you like big hair...
mommy?
what honey?
if you want me to hate her i will.
called him.  we set an ap...
do not do this.
you are saying, do not make the kids a football, do not put them through a war.  but I am doing this for their well-being.
partly.  but partly, you are mad.
you know the kids are not really in danger.  this is about rachel, and you are right, I am disappointed in her learning curve, and...
slugs.  have faster learning curves. trees, even.
I am afraid she is going to walk.
and I am supposed to care.
may i remind you that duncan has the client arriving at exac...
sure.  i was just doin' my nails.
c'mon, these are the bomb, i prom...
now could she just...forget me!
your mom had to...help a friend with this...emergency?  and she called me. and we switched days.  then, i got stuck on my shoot, and...
mommy!
daddy was washing rachel.  in the shower.  what did you think that was about?
sex.  of course.
well, not exactly s...
why does rachel scream?
scream.
during sex.
how would you know sh...
i live.  in the same country.
oh god oh god oh god oh god oh god oh...
...why do you think?
because it feels really incredibly good.
so why are you asking me?
i like talking about it.  at least, to you.
...in.
I am sorry.  look, I am not real comfortable being here, but...
i do not recall inviting you.
i have a snoop.
i did not need you to take the blame for me, I am quite...
i did not do it for you.  believe me.
she already hates me.  you have seen to that.
you are not terribly good at taking care of h...
i need practice.
those are my children you are practicing on.  they deserve first- rate care.  every minute.  of every night.  and every day.
so why did y...
i did it for her.
i have an appointment this after- noon.  i need someone to take them to the park.
what?  and have federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? how many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
however many.  it is not enough.
I am already on thin ice.  yesterday, i actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
fine, forget it.
bandaids for cuts.  bandaids for new shoe blisters.  packet of wash n dri's. kleenex.  sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
why not just bring the whole toilet?
ben likes to be read to.  do you know dr. seuss...?
not personally.
do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can i finish?
people beat it, do not they?  all the time.
every day.  more and more.
so we'll...radiate some more?
at first.  then, after awhile, some chemo.
that is necessary, huh?
let's take our best shot.
i have to get dressed.  my ex-husband has asked me to dinner.  god knows why, he was very mysteri...
have you still never told him?
why would his worry?  or my children's worry.  or anyone's worry.  help the sit...
sooner than later.  you really need to.
because it is quiet.  and he wants to talk.  alise -- once he saws you in half, it is bedtime...
what are you gonna talk about?
probably you -- your brother -- school -- the solar system...the usual...
then why are you putting on mascara?
I am a little tired and it is just a pick-me-up.
but you only wore mascara when you and daddy went on romantic dates...
well daddy and i are just friends now, and that is no reason not to wear mascara...
or blush.  you look pale.
still, please.
annabelle showed me the new dress. she is amazing in it.
getting so beautiful...she looks more like you every day.  jackie...i've really given this a lot of thought.  a great deal of thought...
i did not think a phone call was appropriate...
tell me exactly how you are different from three years ago?  the music sounds kind of the same from where I am sitting.
i grew up, a little.  I am ready for a life that is built around commitm...
just not to me.
it is going to be hard for the kids when i tell them...i'd like you to be there.
to make it easier for them or you?
it is a huge moment in their life --
you can not be an 'us' just when you want to.  you can not play that card when it is convenient.
we...
we are over.
we are still their parents for the next hundred years.
you are still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  we should tell them together.
no.  you think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  you are on your own.
the great thing about life is that things keep changing.
remember when mommy and daddy got divorced?
and we all went through that together?
no they are not.
annabelle put down that camera.
put down that goddamn camera!
you owe me a quarter.
look she is upset --
no I am not.  i do not care.  why should i care?  i mean nobody asked me when you got divorced.  nobody asked me if i wanted a new mother.  nobody even asked me if i like her.  if you guys do not care about our family staying together, why sh...
daddy and i tried hard.  we really did.
but we do have a choice.  to make it better.  instead of worse.
like how?
like seeing the good side of rachel. so she will see the good side of us.
that happens.  to families.
I will be there for you.
oh my god.  are you serious?
i think so...what do you think?
i think so too...
it is forever you know.
okay...is that the good thing or the bad thing?
because i can not hurt anyone like this ever again.
everything's going to work out.  the kids and i...we're going to love each other.
rache, it may take time.
what is eight, ten years?  hell, you will still be ambulatory.  i think.
are you real mad?
how could i be?  we learned some magic...
sorry I am late, i got lost dropping ben off at kevin's.
it is okay, it is twenty minutes.  the horse'll be there.
it is not to wear around, or any- thing, I am way too young.  it is just for play.
see, i...
wow.  who is that for?
well.  it is for you.
I am sorry, i just...
hey.  at least it is not an editing machine.
no way.  i told her two, three years, maybe, for such an expens...
i hope it is the right kind.
are you kidding?  it is so much better than the one rachel showed me!
...i mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. she is like still a kid, herself.
like a big sister.
she knows every neat junk food place.
actually.  she is kind of cool, when you get to know her.
i bet.
and do not tell her i told you.
secret's safe with me.
rache says i have to eat lamb.  i told her you're making me spaghetti!
honey, this is thursday.  i pick you up tomorrow, and we do big spaghetti.
and many meatballs.
you will be up to your armpits in meatballs, I am flying them in from sweden.
is that like luigi's?
not a lot, sweetie.  it is a country. like canada.  only smaller.
where are you, anyway?
I am somewhere, thinking of you.  and meatballs.  and you know what?
yes.
of course, you do.  being magic. then you know I have got a flu bug, and i turn green and barf profusely when i even think about food.  so, all the more meatballs for you.  but you know what.
i did.  do i have to eat lamb? daddy did not cook it, she did.
do me a favor?  eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay?  pay particular attention to whether it is chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup.
that i do.  always will.
mom...?
I am fine, ba...
tomorrow?  can i have one butterscotch pudding for dessert?
mommy, if your real name's jackie and i call you mommy; and rachel's real name's rachel...then when i see her do i say hi stepmommy?  and if my name's ben, how come you do not call me son?
thursday's fine...
are you crazy, you could suffocate in there!!!
nope.  i got my warm t-shirt.
what about obsessively picking her split ends?
anxiety.
last week when she chopped her barbie's bangs all to hell --
she was angry at herself.
jackie?
yes?
when i twisted hair like this it means I am intimidated by you...
you feeling all right?
not great.  plus, I have got things on my mind.  you know.
...thinking of going back to random house.  on a part-time basis.
wowie.  how wonderful!
...make some trips into the city. sometimes, overnight.
hey, any help you need, we will cover.
uh.  have you told luke and the ki...
let's...hold up for a bit.  it may not happen.  our secret, okay?
...for christmas, okay?  every magician needs a white dove, a real one, they do!
well, that is a long way off, sweetie. we will talk to mom and dad...
dad!  you can talk him into anything!
'in the still...still of the ni-ight...i held you... held you so ti-ight'...take it, man...
doo-wop-doo-doo, doo-wop-doo-doo...
she is a charmer, you will see.  in fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.
stop.  you are making me insecure.
it is temporary.
it is good.  you are not pulling a mid-life crisis on us, are you?
you want us to take him tonight? give you some private time with annab....
never stand between that kid and a meatball.
yet another spaghetti night.
yeh, better i should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  boy, kids go wild for that.
no.
pray.  we never find out.
hi, I am here to pick up ben.
does jackie know this?
no.  I am doing it behind her back.
in seven years jackie's never missed one of tucker's parties. where is she?
something came up.  c'mon ben! I have got a shoot at three...
tucker has not penned ben's present yet -- it will not be too much longer.
i do not know wh...
i was looking for annabelle's book, and i found your tickets.  and the note.  from your new boss.
my boss.
you are not working at random house, i talked to them.
you what?
you are taking the kids.  and moving to san francisco.
look, you have never liked me...
do not flatter yourself.
and i know checking into your life was inexcusable...
nobody likes a snoop.
but i came here to...
bi-coastal parenting.  happens every day.  luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it is not ideal, but people make it work, and...
we can not live like that.
did i hear the word...
luke.  can not live like that.
then let him talks to me.  we do not need you to solve our prob...
...it's my problem, too.
i got used to...thinking of them. as...my kids too.
really.  by what right?  six months of part-time screw-ups?
life's a trade-off.  you get cancer, your hair falls out, but you do get to smoke dope.
you are not dying.
you bet you are.
how the hell would you know?
i don't, but...
how would you know anything?
and cigarettes.  i smoke, too.
you are marrying the greatest guy who walks this earth.  who i have loved from my heart for twelveyears!
they came out of my body!
see, i know that.
i have given them morelove and more care every fifteen minutes of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty years!
okay, I am undeserving.
ironic, huh?
i know.  i would not know what to say.  if it were you.
we are going to win this.
walk in the park.  and thanks for the 'we'.
what happens next?
i live or i die.
so what is up?  who is marrying who this time?
mommy's marrying rache!
mommy's sick, guys.
you have the worst flu since...
i have cancer.  do you know what that is?
grammy had a different kind. there are lots of kinds.  hers was very bad.
is your bad?
i had a lot of treatments, and they were not any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
a lot smaller.
so you are okay.
I am still sick, but I am better.
i know how scared i get when you're sick.  so i waited to tell you.  until it was getting smaller. i thought that was best, maybe i was wr...
you lied.  if you lied then, maybe you are lying now.  i can never belive you again!
we make mistakes.  and we forgive each other.  because we love each other, very m...
where is rache?  it is thursday, we get to be with rache!
I would rather be with mommy.
she is dying and rache is your mother now!
you do not run out on your moth...
you are worse than she is!  why do not you just die, too?
well, i think you should tell him you changed your mi...
it is no biggie.
it is just an assignment.
it is anna sui, you should be doing it.
are you hungry?  you could make us something?
they are my kids.
great, wallow in guilt, you sure you are not jewish?
she is not going to die.
i know that.
i can not hear you.
then turn off the cartoon!
i said...
...i'm not deaf, y'know.
in the still...still of the ni-ight...i held you...held you so ti-ight...
that is rache's song!
sugar.  i was slow dancing to that song before rachel was even born.
he would not know.  i saw her in the shower!
and...?
she is only the princess of cool. mommy is the queen!
she is but an arriviste.
small world.
luke's depo ran late.  i promised I would take notes.
so i have to tell you something in confidence...
you are a cross-dresser.
that.  and.  annabelle is over her head.  with brad 'the dreamboat' kovitsky.
she has not mentioned this.
she was afraid you would make a big deal out of it.
moi?
toi.  they have been 'going out' for two weeks.
as you may know, 'going out' in the six grade does not mean shit.  they do not actually go to a movie or anywhere, they do not even eat lunch together, it is just a declaration to the world that they're...
...going out, yeh.  i had kids of my own, once.
anyway.  he walks up to her on lunch yard today.  and tells her... publicly...that they are 'breaking up.'
oh, my god.
right.  which is the whole point of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
she is devastated.
does not begin to describe it. i mean, you have got cancer, this is serious.
and you said...?
beats me.  ask your mom.
what is thursd...
a debate.  man's inhumanity to woman.  he is pro women.  I am con. ms. flannery is twisted.
i could help with the debate.
great.
actually.  i could only help him.
every time I am on the lunch yard, and he is with twelve of his retarded dorkface little adoring out-crowd henchmen...
you do not like his friends.
...they all yell 'there goes the virgin queen' or the 'ice princess', or some really clever cut like that. like it hurts my feelings.
you would not kiss him, huh?
not with my mouth open.
good girl.
and what do you do wh...
i call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
you have to ignore him.
he is not even there.  you do not see him, you do not hear him, you are just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.
this is a joke, right?
this'll work, huh?
oh, yeh.
how many devilled eggs can you eat?
maybe twenty.
ben!  mommy's so glad to see you -- now stop climbing!  ben listen to me...
no!  i have to get there.
where ben?
before you.
ben where do you have to get to?
heaven.  i have to tell him he is made a mistake.  he should take grammy martha first.  or grandpa norman.
ben.  god does not like visitors.
how do you know?
ask her, she is a heroic fireperson. she does this twenty times a day.
oh.
annabelle...wake up honey...
mom?  what is wrong?
nothing sweetheart.
is that you?
it is your girlfriend, big guy, open up.
she still packing for her trip?
i killed my math quiz, a-minus.
can i look at the pictures?
it is a mess, right now.  that is my project when i get back.
so.  hopeful.
it is promising, this one.  we are upbeat.
i really look like shit.
you look sick.  but you look... together.  mentally tough.
yeh, that is bull.  I am going for serene, they say some actually get there.
you try to center on the big issues, y'know.  what it is all about.  what this whole trip has meant.  but then, the really big issues keep swamping y...
brad kovitsky.
the primo stuff is great for pain.
i think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
he is relentless.  a major asshole.
and you said...
what else?  keep on keepin' on.
no problem.
i made that paella you liked. it is on the stove.
you know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me now?  in front of the whole world? frosty, the snow bitch!!
that is so weak.
here's weak...mom said she was going to talk to the teacher and brad's parents!!  can you believe the humiliation???
honey, she will not d...
eat your heart out.  is annabelle there?
yeh, she's...i'll get you ben first, it is past his bedti...
how is she doing with brad?
can i say one thing?  i mean, the last thing i want to do is inter- fere on the brad thing, b...
thanks, but it is under control.
yah?  well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever.  needs to know when to find a plan b.  cos plan a is not and will n...
it is covered, okay?  i appreciate your concern.  can i talk to her?
annabelle, i know you miss your mother.  so why do not you say hello.
why do not you say hello?
annabelle pick up the phone.
annabelle pick up the phone.
that does not bother me.
that does not bother me.
you think this is funny?
you think this is funny?
no.  i think it is ugly.
you are just a stepmother.  so stop bossing, cos nobody's listening!
june 3rd, god willing, I will marry your dad.  and then i will be your stepmom. and right now, I am not looking forward to th...
suits me fine!
darling, I have been thinking about our little brad problem?  and i think it is time we move to plan b...
you cannot believe what he said, it was the worst instant of my total life on earth!!
i know.  i know how rough life can be. and how unfair.  so here's what we do. tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk straight up to that little jerk...
and bring my knees up, real hard, yeh?
no, that never solves anything.  you talk like the big girl you are.  about what you feel.  and how he is hurt you. you know?  you tell the truth.
it is 1:45, i told you there is no one to pick up annab...
but you are not done!
I have got it.  it is in the can, cooper can wrap th...
we do not know if you have got it, we have not seen it yet!  now go back and finish!
which part of no do not you understand?
look, i will send a p.a. to pick up the children.  there are agencies that supply sitters, nannies...
they are losing one mother.  they can not lose two.
you are making a career decision here, i would strongly sugg...
duncan.  I have got an even better idea...
you can not do that, i will not let you!
no, no, no, this is a job that is hard to keep, not a job that is hard to lose, can not be both.
rachel, don't do this, you will never forgive yourself!
oh, baby, I am so sor...
it is not your fault!!
i did what she said.  i used my words, i told him what i felt, and they...
...laughed, yeh.  they laughed real hard.
now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I am going to rip his fucking heart out!
no, his mother's always on time.
and mom says anger never, never solves anything.  it makes every- thing worse.
that is because your mother is a fine person, finer than i will ever be.  now, just this once...
and youdon't tell her.  what you are going to say.
not use my words, please!
no, baby.  you are going to use my words.
help me here...
uh.  he thinks his nose is too big.  but it is not.
great.  big ears, too?
no.  but they stand out, a little. like this.
uh.  what is it?
oh.  it is an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I would never let you go to.  but it is real.  does he have an older brother?
in high school.
he will be impressed.  the clincher is, you walk away, then whip around...
the guy i see is in the eighth grade at prep school, and he laughs his ass off every time we talk about you.
but rache...
a suitable boy, will be at this flagpole, on monday, with a very expensive bike, and he will be a stone fox if i have to call an escort service!
okay.  these are good.
i helped.
I have got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie.  and I am a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
rache can do that part.
hon, maybe your mom would like t...
...go to the park.  in the worst way.
I am thinking.  do i know you well enough to really chew you out?
no.
it is just not the right time t...
do what you have worked your whole life to do?
it was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
you mean, after I am dead?
hey, you have not quit on you, I am sure as hell not gonna.  i just mean, I am juggling a lot right n...
juggle it!  move the darkroom into your house.  you have got that room downstairs with the treadmill luke never uses anyway.  do not lose your confidence.  do not lose your edge.
it is the same choice you made.
yes.  i made the choice that was right for me.  and i do not regret it.  but even for me, there were days when i felt so lost, so invis- ible.  and then I would hate myself for the kids not being enough.
i know you, huh?  the car pools, he measles, the pta.  it is not going to be enough for you in the long run.  you have to think long term.
i just want to spend time with them when I am not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
that is motherhood.  that is the job, with or without a career. I am telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. they need you to be happy.
my advice to you?  do not die.
feeling the pressure?
somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  he loves to hear that story, over and over.  how he was born a magician.
and her...?
took 28 hours.  she just was not sure about entering this world.
that thing you said before.  pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. because of what you gave up for motherhood...
is that what he told you?
he will not discuss it.  just calls it history.
what a great surpri...
hold your applause.  we are not having fun, here.
just like to make sure.  that your past.  and my future.  are real different.
well, they will be.
imagine my relief.  so what is for dinner?
why in the world would she t...
you took a fishing trip with the boys. liked it so much, you took another.
i needed some time away.
...while she watched the kids.  then, you booked this flat in paris for your family's summer.  but she said...
'...the kids have camp.  their friends are here.  over there, I will just be shopping in a language i do not even know.  my life, and the kids' lives, are not here to service your mid-life crisis.'  did it go like that?
she called it a fight.  the fight.
what do you call it?  you told her you had doubts.
can we go sit somewhere?
let me put it this way.  hell, no.
i told her i loved her.
by way of saying you were unhappy.
restless.
excuse me.  'things are so confusing for me, jack.  our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able.  it is a partnership, it is juggling schedules.  when i think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
'...i do not know if i can make it.' that is what i said.  but i did not leave.
no, she threw you out.  what a difficult woman.
that is a pretty ugly thing you just said.
no, here's ugly.  'i love you, babe. it is just our life together I am not so sure about...'
'but keep dancing, and if you are lucky, i might just never leave, who knows?'
that is not us.
because you have changed so much.
we make our lives, one step at a time.  we do the best we can.  the truth about the future?  a promise. is only a hope.
how about the promises we make to our kids?  about their future.  do we shrug those off, just that easily?
where you goin'?
I am going to get me a drink.
you really did not have to come, you know.  I would have brought them straight t...
who in the world is he?
looks nice enough to m...
he looks familiar.  did he do a calvin klein ad?
now we are going to have a fight, you and i.
are we.
and I am going to win.
do not be too sure.
now, 'limp dick', i know.  what. is 'snowballing'?
it does not matter, i did not tell h...
because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  and they will b...
give 'em my number.
actually.  they will want annabelle's mother.
is that what you are worried about? looking bad at the pta?
you are defending what you did?
right down to the ground.  let's get to it.
you put filth in my child's mouth.
aw.
you had her lie about that... that fancy-boy model!
worked.  like a charm.
she was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
so you became the hero.  and i became the schmuck.
you taught my child that i am some limp dick loser.  who did not care about her pain.
that is not wh...
you think i did not have some dirty words for that little putz?  you think i could not figure out some low blows?
you were not passing 'em out.
well, maybe your version of growing up is 'just win, baby'.
see, in that crisis, i saw an opportunity.  for some real growth.
oh please.
shut the fuck up.  i did not go behind your back.
doing the right thing.  knowing who you are, inside.  not caving to peer pressure, or lowering yourself to that level, steering your own course...
she was not steering her own course, she was steering yours.
well, that is what parenting is about, little girl.  they are pleading to know how they are supposed to do it. and you sure as hell showed her.
and there will come another moment. when the stakes are really there. and she will look back on this.  and remember how good it felt.  how easy it was.
and she will fight back again.  god help me, what have i done.
you have turned her into you.  and i may not get another chance.  to turn her back.
that's what it is.  and that is all it is.
you know, this horse smells really bad.
there is worse things.
...your hating me.
cos she loves you.
cos she loves you.  she wanted you to have a daddy to love.  even if he didn't...completely...deserve it.
thanks for coming out.
neutral ground.  what is up?
she likes a stolie, no ice.
double.
what is this about?  because we fought?
do not flatter yourself.  i always liked that line.
i love luke, i love the children. but there is more to life than even love...
no, there isn't.
and i have looked down the road. at what my life will be.  and i can not handle it.
i never wanted to be a mom.  then, sharing it with you was one thing. carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
is scary.  but you want it.  gimme some truth here.
well, it is the jack kennedy syndrome, huh?  you die young, you always look golden.  perfect.  the memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
come on, a wuss like me?  the stiff who would not help her own daughter fight back?
maybe i was wrong on that one.
you are lying.
i lost him.  i was panicked.
you are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 seconds, you could find him from a coma, there is no way!
i was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  doing my imitation of you.
ben never mentioned it.
he only remembers i found him.  my point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing i could ever have done for you.
why did not i?
uh.  you hate my guts?
with good reason.  they fucking worship you as it is.
what do i have that you don't?
everything.  you're...the earth mother incarnate...
you are the hip and fresh.
you ride with annabelle...
you will learn.
you know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's happiness has been wrapped up in you, every moment...
i have their past.
now edna says you short-changed your last meds.  you can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
just want to be a little sharper. for a few minutes.
you know, there is nothing you have to say.  because they know your heart.  you do not have t...
just sit me up.  nice and tall. bring benjamin first.
find the bird cage?
rache says it is from you.
well, do not make him disappear before i see him.
so what do you think we are going to talk about?
you dying.
if a soldier loses his legs in a war.  is he the same guy?  sure he is.
but you can still see him.
half.  of him.
the world.  thinks I am gone.  but only the magician.  knows better.
so where are you?
right here.  right here.  inside the magician.  shhhh.
can i talk to you?  when you are there.
always.  always.  and you will not hear a voice.  but in here.  you will know.  what I am saying.
it is not good enough.
no, it isn't.  because it is not everything.  and we want every- thing, do not we?
i do not want to say goodbye.
don't. take me with you.
thank god.  i got to see you. grown up.
I am not.
let me be the judge of that.
keep ben's for awhile, okay?  until he is old enough to not open them all at once.
until he is old enough to read.
are you afraid for me?  where I am going.
yes.
do not be.  I am going.  where we all go.  now how can that be bad.
I will miss you so much.
good.  that is very good.
