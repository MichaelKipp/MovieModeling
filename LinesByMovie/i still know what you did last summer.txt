julie! wait! you okay?
i'm fine.
you sure?
i'm fine.
you don't seem fine.
the shower again?
it was in a church...it was so real. i mean, i could feel his breath on me.
i'm sorry.
i thought i was over the dreams for good. i really did. i hadn't had one for months.
it just takes time, julie. it's gonna get better.
it can't get worse. i mean, it's not like this was the first time i freaked out in class. i hardly ever get a full night's sleep, my grades suck, i'm this close from being thrown out of school.
it was one year ago...
it's...the anniversary. that's what's going on...take it easy on yourself.
i'm trying. i really am...sometimes i don't even know why i came up here in the first place.
to get out of southport?
right. now i remember.
nah. i'll probably just be here studying for finals. the joys of summer school...  are you okay?
i'm okay.
are you sure?
i got in early. i was excited...  who was that guy?
oh, that's will. he's a friend. you'd like him.
yeah.
ray, we're just friend.
every guy in history who tried to pick up a girl did the good-friend thing first.
why are you being like this?
ray, i can't...
can't what?
i just feel like some part of me hasn't healed up enough to go back. like some critical piece is missing. please understand...
i understand something.
it's not like that. it's not you. it's me. my head. i want to go back. i want to be with you. i want to be fine. i want everything to be like it used to be.  it just isn't.
i thought you were out of town!
what are you doing in my closet?
i thought you were out of town!
what are you doing in my closet?
i just wanted your black pants, but i'm not ready to die for them!
that was heart attack time, karla.
no. when i put these skinny pants on my body...now, that's heart attack time.
i'm not going anywhere. i'm fat, ugly, and depressed.
yeah, right -- whatever.
i think i just really hurt ray's feelings.
listen to me, julie. ray's a great guy, nothing against old ray, but he's so...ray. i mean, he lives in southport. will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
there's nothing between will and me.
yet. nothing yet.
you know what i want to do to you ...right now, don't you? there's gotta be somewhere we can be alone.
i don't think so. it's pretty crowded.
just for a minute, baby. i got something i wanna tell you.
if you can say all you gotta say in a minute then i don't wanna hear it.
i'll talk real slow.
you're the most beautiful woman in the bar tonight, jules.
tyrell, you are an unstoppable force of nature.
that's right. it's how the species survives. you'll never convince me otherwise.  wanna dance?
say yes.
no.
no means yes.
tyrell, i appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? we make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
worse comes to worse, you can stand there and watch me.
come on, i'll take a break and we'll all dance.
karla! did you tell him i'd be here?
nope. i told him that you absolutely, positively would not be here at this bar between ten o'clock and eleven o'clock tonight. and then he came anyway.
this was not my idea.
what?
i said, this...do you want a drink?
that could break the machine.
julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. it's a fact.
the number's unlisted...
would you relax? we've been dating three months. he ain't stalking your butt.
okay, okay. you're right.
i know it, and it feels good.  hi, ty.
mark in the morning! magic 96.7! oh my god! i'm karla. karla wilson.  jules, it's mark in the morning.
well, karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
well, i'm in school and --
how'd you like to win a magic 96.7 quicky getaway?
yes!
still here...thinking...  you mean brazil, the country?
okay, karla, five seconds.  five...four...
rio de janeiro!
oh, no...did you say rio?
no. yes?
waaaaahhhhhhhhhh!
we'll call you back with all the details...so what's your favorite radio station?
hey. i'm really glad you called... i'm sorry.
no, you don't have to be sorry. i'm the one --
no, i shouldn't have left so fast... i was just...
it's okay.
ray, karla won a trip to the bahamas! an island called tower bay. and she wants us to come with her.
what? the bahamas? you're kidding.
we'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  you know...
this weekend?
you'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me?
idiot. idiot. idiot.
you gotta sell his butt on the bahamas?
ray, come on. i want us to be together.
julie, we're working a big run up here. it's been crazy. we probably have to go out again tonight. i don't think i can do it.
will you try...for me, please?
okay, i'll try. but, listen...  if i don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time.
ray...please try. i really miss you.  okay. bye.
stupid. stupid.
stupid. what were you thinkng?
jeez, ray, fourth and forty, throw the bomb.
i should go up there. i should call her back, tell her i'm coming.
no way, man. surprise her. she'll be psyched.
i don't know, man. maybe we should keep going, find a phone --
no.
the guy looks dead.
he's not coming. i thought he was just...
julie, you left four messages... four.
but, he said he'd try.
he said he'd try. try is like maybe. try is nothing!
he does work hard.
work hard, huh? he's breaking your heart just because he can.  and i don't want to have to say i told you so...
then, don't.
oh!
hey, sorry...  he's my friend, too. and that ticket is not going to waste.
julie, is everything cool? karla said...
i said we start having fun. and that means now.
is there a problem here?
where there's a will, there's a way. come on.
just take deep breaths and think of something happy from childhood.
what if i don't have anything happy from childhood...sorry, i can't relax going five hundred miles an hour, or four thousand, four hundred feet a minute...  which is over seven hundred feet a second. imagine hitting something at seven hundred feet a second.
deep breaths --
fumes build up in the fuel tanks. you can by surface-to-air missiles over the internet. planes use o-rings...which freeze in tap water. planes fall from the sky for practically no reason at all.
you've got a better chance of getting hit by lightning.
right. planes get hit by lightning. they get hit by meteors. they hit other planes.
something is gonna hit your butt if you don't quit complaining.
honey, some folks just can't fly.
i'm the king of the world.
no, i'm the king of the world.
remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' i do for a weekend once every ten years.
i will, and you remind me of the same thing.
can't talk right now.
see, it's not a macho thing. it's about equilibrium in your inner ear. you could've used a patch, but it's too late now. get used to it.  some folks just can't sail.
hello? hello?
where is everyone? i'll ask --
what can i do for you?
checking in...karla wilson.
it sure is a beautiful old hotel.
built in 1948 for a member of the rockefeller clan. the tile work was imported from spain. a lot of history in these walls...judy garland stayed here...hemmingway fished for marlin right off that dock --
you're in 201 and 202.
is that bad?
not at all. those are our honeymoon suites.
your what?
honeymoon suites. i take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet?
we haven't exchanged anything.
julie, we're talkin' suites!  that'll be just fine with us.
and, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need.
wait...did you say off-season?
july fourth weekend. storm season starts today. the clouds roll in like clockwork.
storm season?
it's our version of winter.  201 and 202. there's scrabble and parcheesi in the lobby. enjoy.
ain't nothin' free in this world. everybody says it, and it's true.  i wanted you all to have a good trip.
we will, baby...all this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
and it's been blue skies all day. it might be perfect all weekend.
it beets being on the mainland.
oooh, the mainland --
somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. tropical!
guess the capital of brazil --
rio, baby!
their stuff in there...  ...and ours in here.
karla! you promised.
i also promised tyrell.
you sure it's okay with you?
sure. it's fine. as long as you don't snore.
you can toss a shoe at me if it gets out of hand.
you guys lost?
tell me this ain't the bar scene.
wanna drink?
we didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
planter's punch, singapore sling, or how about a mai-tai?
the last day of the season. yeah, we heard.
so why are you still here?
what's the matter, boy trouble?
not anymore.
he leave you?
no. i shot him.
am i bad? i mean, he's really great, and he's cute --
he's cute...and he's got a crush on you...  but...
i miss ray...i tried to call him.
pretty cool bar.
they all start to look the same once you've worked in one.  am i right, sister?
to a great weekend --
yeah, a great weekend. forget the weather!
karaoke -- perfect.
don't even think about it.
okay, i won't.
no way.
yes.
no.
yes.
not me...no way...
come on, it'll be fun.
ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, julie james.
julie? what's wrong?
it's...him.
what do you mean, julie?
he did something to the screen...it, it, said...
oh, will! i'm sorry.
it's my fault. i shouldn't have...i didn't think...
no, no, no. this was really sweet...
i scared you -- i crossed the line --
no -- it's not that. it's...i'm just a little on edge. i'm really sorry.
hey, you don't have to appologize to me. i'm the one. i understand.  i'm going to take a walk and dry off.
are you sure? i really appreciate it.
tha's it.  i've decided.  i'm changing my major to finance.  and going to wall street.
why?
'cause that's the only way i'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this.
get lost, you scared me.
fish are all over the water...come on, let us take a boat out.
titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in spain.
that's why you'll come with titus, mon.
there's a storm comin', titus. no boats are going out.
storm is what makes it interesting. thass why all the fish are up. less hook us a couple big ones.
i got work to do. take the bake elsewhere.
up-tighteous and self-righteous.
you sure you didn't pick up my hair tie?
hello?
okay, i just didn't wanna get my hair wet.
baby, i finally got you alone in this jacuzzi and i don't wanna be discussin' hair care.
i used to be a lifeguard...i'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
i'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
there's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this jacuzzi with us.
how's the water?
crowded.
ahh, that feels great.
how's julie?
alone. in the room.  got any advise?
what? what are you talking about? where?
it's in my room!
there was a body! i swear it!
julie, you said you were tired. waybe you were dreaming.
i wasn't dreaming.
listen to me. he's here.
who? who is here?
what's going on?
julie thinks there's a dead guy in the closet.
cool.
the rest of us see bathrobes.
i am not crazy, tyrell. he was right there.
fine. show me the body.
think about this, julie. what did you actually see?
the dockhand guy. hanging by his neck from up there.
i want off this island.
not possible, i'm afraid. the last ferry left hours ago. and we got a storm coming. there won't be another one for days.
then i'll call the mainland for a charter.
phones went down a few minutes ago.
duh. the next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it.
what about a radio?
sorry. emergencies only.
what the hell would you call this?
i'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts.  all we can do now is batten down and ride it out. if things get really bad, there's a storm shelter.
jeez, that's a full carat --
how much?
well, there's some flaws in her...
how much?
don't really have the market for something like this...  i can go two...two-fifty.
make it three hundred. and throw that in, too.
hell, that's worth three, easy. and you got your waiting period.
i'm not waiting...so give me the gun and keep the ring.
you get any sleep at all?
some.
oh, look. another day in paradise with julie-your-tour-director...miss psychotic episode.
hey --
see any dead bodies out there? any fresh kill? how 'bout freddy, jason?
i'm just saying what all of you are thinking. it's bad enough gettin' rained out without having to hold her hand the whole time.
you don't have to be a jerk.
it's okay...he doesn't believe me. that's his right. i'm starting to think i'm crazy, too.
hey, slow down, turn off the little motor up in there...what do you say we go to the gym and work off a little stress?
nice move.
i'll be givin' your fisherman some of that and see how he likes it.
where is everybody?
they're all dead...dead, i tell you.  ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. tyrellll, joinnnn usss.
they're around...they just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  let's go find stoner boy...make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or ping-pong paddles or something.
you know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
hey -- shut up, okay?
cancer in a box.
no, this is the safe sun.  it's better than a day at the beach.
karla!
just kidding.
take this.
and do what with it?
i'm not crazy...i'm not crazy. he's here...  we've got to get to the radio and call for help.
i think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
somebody...is a sick, fingerpainting psycho.
we gotta get out of here. now.
they were cut loose.
julie? wanna tell us what is going on here?
we're all going to die. he's going to kill us one by one.
who?
ben willis.
oh, stop it! he's dead. you killed him. now, get over it. we gotta think here.
they never found the body.
julie...
only he wasn't dead. he killed barry and helen last july fourth.
the porter...what's his name? old asbestos --
estes! that's exactly who it is. that old guy knows something. we can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
voodoo.
i told you.
we'll only be a second, okay?
yeah, wait right here, it's the safest place.
let him go. i believe him.
come on, julie. you saw his room.
what do you mean?
rio isn't the capital of brazil. it was the wrong answer. sorry, we lose.
you've got all these theories but where is he? where? where's your fisherman killer?
i don't know.
you never do...the guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. little notes that only mean something to you. how do we even know you're not the one behind this --
i know i don't want to stay in here.
we'll be better off in the open. if we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good.
be careful, julie.
i've got to see.
julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. there's no way off this place.
then, we fight --
where'd estes go?
what is up with that weirdo?
i'll go find him.
why? he can't help us.
he's probably the only one who can help us.
i'll come with you.
are you crazy? we're not staying here on our own.
maybe we should just wait here? hide in a tree?
i'm not hiding up no tree.  i'm with her. let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.
i'm your best friend...you could have told me the truth about what happened. i would've understood.
karla, i just wanted the whole thing to be over. i didn't want to involve anybody else.
it's too late for that.
you think that's a good place to hide?
i don't know, but i'm starving.
don't kill me --
wait, it's nancy --
i'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
and so could you -- crazy fool.
you stumbled into my hiding place.
must have missed the sign.
excuse me, but this island didn't have a murder rate until you people showed up.  i've never seen a dead body before.
there's no way to lock it.
what do we do?
i don't know...
come on, you can make it.
julie?
i'm right here. grab my hand.
i'm holding your hand!
no, you're not.
...nancy?
come on. we're gonna be okay.
did you get help?
estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
he's in it with willis?
i guess so.
why are you doing this to me?
me, me, me. it's always about you. i'm having bad dreams. i can't sleep. i'm not doing well in school. i'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
i trusted you.
we had a connection, didn't we? i can tell you one thing, though. ray didn't trust me. he was right. he's dead, but he was right.
...why?
why? come on, julie. think. you'll get it. will benson -- ben's son.
oh, god, it's you --
you're okay. thank god.
is he?
ray...what are you doing?
oh...it's not working right. you're home early.  did i scare you?
never do that again.
hey -- i didn't know you were here. it's okay.  we got the refrigerator in. come see.
i love it here.
it's gonna be great.
checking the locks again?
you know me to well.
