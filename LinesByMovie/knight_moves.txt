congratulations, dad.
my cheering section.
you opened with the english.  lutz won't use it.  he opened his first game with it.
he knows you're aware of that.
then i'll transpose.
on a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
i suppose you have something in mind?
it's a good play, but risky.
you don't win by playing it safe, peter.
what are you doing up?
i can't sleep.  my beds lumpy.
i see.  you forgot to bring you're night-light, didn't you?
that has nothing to do with it.
you want to sleep in my bed tonight?
okay.
sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, frank.
run it down.
debi rutlege.  female.  caucasian. twenty four.  worked over at the four oaks hotel.
local?
no.  she just moved here last month from portland.
whaddaya got, nolan?
not much.  there's no sign of a break in.  i think she let him in.
how long has she been dead?
six, eight hours tops.
any sign of rape?
not that i can see.  we'll know more once i get the lab reports back from seattle.
there's no blood.  where's the fuckin' blood?
bingo.
anything?
not much.  i don't think she was raped. there's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
what about prints?
no prints.
you mean, no prints but hers?
no frank.  no prints.
i know you're busy so i'll get right to it.  did you know her?
only in passing.  to say hello to.
i've talked to a few people who say you and her were... friendly?
chess tournaments can be boring sometimes.  people have a lot of free time.  they like to gossip.
could you tell me where you were last night?
here.  i played gregory lutz.
i know.  you won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  where did you go after that?
to my room and then i went for a walk.
by yourself?
yes.
this is a printout from the hotel computer for all the messages logged to your room.  here's one at 9:04 pm.  it says:  from debi.  please call me at home.
she called to give me my schedule for tomorrow.
what's interesting about it is you say you only knew her in passing.  yet, she says on her message for you to call her at home and she doesn't leave a number. that would imply you already knew the number.
i got it from the tournament directory.
we seem to have a little problem here?
what kind of problem?
i think you're lying.  that's what kind of problem.
what are you saying?
what do you think?
he's got an answer for everything, but he doesn't have an alibi.
you think he's dirty?
i don't know, but i think you're right. he's lying.
hello, peter.  you played an interesting game last night.  even though sacrificing your queen at b-5 is the game i played against valsney in '82.  i'm glad it helped you.
i'm sure you are.
no, i want you to do good.  that way when i beat you at the end i'll look that much better.
you're getting sloppy, yurilivich. you're nervous?
i'm not nervous.
well, you should be, because this time i'm going to win.
well, then this time you'll have to stay for the whole match, won't you?
who told you that?
mrs. lutz.  she also told me that mr. lutz goes to a medium to try and contact great grandmasters in the spirit world.
has he gotten through to any?
no, but he did contact a dead parcheesi champion from ohio.
hello, peter.
who is this?
someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  i want to play a game with you.
i haven't got time for this.
what is it, dad?
nothing.
why didn't you tell us you were there earlier?
i don't know.  i was afraid there'd be hours of questions.  i can't afford to miss a game.
we wouldn't want someone's death to interfere with your games.
what was your relationship with her?
casual.
casual?  you were boning her weren't you?
it wasn't serious.  what's your problem?
you are!  i don't like you.
fine, don't ask me out on a date.
take it easy.  both of you.
i'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
what's that supposed to mean?
it means, if i were a killer and i thought the police were closing in on me i might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
that's crazy!  why would i draw attention to myself like that?
you like to play games, don't you, peter?
he says on the photo he'll call tomorrow at eleven.  why not come back then and listen for yourself.
oh, we'll be back.  you can bet on it.
no shit!
could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
sorry.  i thought it was empty.
it's alright.
is this your first time here?
yes.
i love this hotel.  i stay here every time i visit my parents.
how come you don't stay with them?
because i love them, but they drive me crazy.  you know how parents are?
no.  i don't.
are you with the tournament?
uh huh.
are you one of the players?
yes.
i've always wanted to learn how to play chess.  i don't have the patience for it.  when did you start playing?
when i was very young.
it seems like such a complicated game.
not really.  you see your goal and you go after it.  anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
sounds very violent.
chess is a reflection of life.  life is violent.  the strong win.  the weak perish.
--but you enjoy being the stronger one? you like the control.
if you're asking me if i'm passionate about what i do, the answer is yes. without passion, nothing moves us. what's your passion?
that's a very personal question.
i see.  this is going to be a very polite conversation.  what shall we discuss?  the weather?  movies?
are you disappointed that i won't answer you?
i had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
i thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
it is.
do you always open quickly?
are we talking about me, or chess?
you.
each circumstance requires a different tactic.
well, i hope you remember that tomorrow when you play krikorian.
well, i think i've had enough.
getting too hot in here for you?
what are you looking for?
nothing.  i just came in for a steam.
no you didn't.
well?
well what?  i told you this was a stupid idea.  you can't learn anything from someone in a few minutes.
you didn't pick up any vibes from the guy?
i'm a psychologist, frank... not a psychic.  what's this all about anyway?
what did dr. fulton tell you?
only that you wanted someone from the institute to talk to sanderson for some case you're working on.  what'd he do?
we're not sure.
what do you think he did?
we think he could be a suspect in a murder investigation.
you might not have done it had you known.
you're damn right!  i'm a child psychologist and you send me into a room with someone who could be a murderer!
would you mind keeping your voice down? i have guests.
oh, well we wouldn't want to disturb your guests, would we?
the police came to me for help.  what could i do?
you could have been honest with me for starters.  we work together.  i have to be able to trust you.
i admit i handled it badly.  sanderson wasn't going to talk to me... but you're young, attractive--
--the same type as the girl who got killed.  jesus, alan, the guy could be a psychopath.
they asked who would be best suited for this and you--
don't patronize me!  you sent me into a potentially dangerous situation and didn't warn me!
it worked out alright, didn't it?
fuck off!
i'm busy right now.
it's important.
mister sanderson, this is doctor sheppard.  she's a psychologist helping us out.
we've already met.  haven't we... doctor.
i see you're still having problems with your openings.
and this jeremy--
--edmonds.  i know.  you lost to karpov in '82, didn't you?
hello, peter.
just a second.  hello?
very amateurish, peter.  i'm surprised you would use such an obvious tactic.  i'm not an idiot!  don't treat me as one!  i'll call you everyday... you get one minute, whether you put me on hold or talk is up to you!  are you ready to play?
yes.  why did you kill debi rutlege?
to get your attention.
did you know her?
no, only the path she chose to travel.
and -- what path is that?
we all have paths to follow.  you hope yours will lead you to me.
why did you write remember on the wall?
that's something you'll have to figure out for yourself.  really, peter, you can't expect me to answer such direct questions.
why not?
you don't want to think and that's why i'll win!  i'm already two points ahead.
what?
i did another one last night.  you might have saved her, but you didn't want to play.
where is she?
you'll find her.
if you got something to say to me, just come out and say it!
i suppose you want to know where i'm going to kill tonight, peter?
you're not going to tell me that.
"wee willie winkie runs through the town.  upstairs and downstairs in his nightgown.  crawling through the window.  at the end of miss emma's street.  her god has gone and left his home.  so her and i can meet."
sorry.
anything?
you want me to go with you?  maybe i can help.
that's alright.  we'll take it from here.
you should be an actor, frank.  you looked like you were really mad.  the veins popping out on your neck was a really nice touch.
you weren't mad at him for picking up the phone?
no.  i told him to.  i wanted to make sure there was someone on the other end.
but we heard him.
it could have been a tape.  a prerecorded conversation between sanderson and himself.
the f.b.i. has nothing remotely similar to this guy.  i think he's a first- timer.
check with the state.  if he's never killed outside of washington the f.b.i. wouldn't have it.  nolan?
he tapes their mouths shut.  we found traces of adhesive around the victims mouths.  we're doing a chemical analysis for components, but it's probably a standard brand you can buy in any hardware store.
there's only two hardware stores on the whole island.  we'll check that out. what about the blood?
not a drop.  maybe the guy works for the red cross.
kathy?
well, the fact that he views this as a game suggests that he is trying to prove some sense of superiority -- and the way he murders confirms a need to be in complete control of his victim.
what about the way he arranged the body?
that would indicate he's playing out a fantasy.  power-control killers usually fantasize about their actions long before they commit them.  once they become a reality though, they reach a sense of euphoria and need to repeat the act to sustain it.  but, in all the research i've read on serial killers, i've never heard of one moving so fast. it's as if the game is the catalyst for the murders -- not the other way around.
anything else?
yes.  why disguise your voice if no one knows it?
i was thinking the same thing.  he must be local.  it's logical for him to assume that the police would be there, but he recognized andy's voice and called him by name.  what about this?
i would think it's some type of clue as to where he's going to kill next?
why does he call sanderson?
he's one of the best chess players in the world.  who better to play a game with?
you still having a problem with this?
yeah, i am.  i think he's playing us. if i was a killer and the police were trying to make a case against me, what better why to draw them off than to put their attention on someone else?
sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
i don't know.  maybe there's two of them.  maybe he hired some wino to make the calls.
maybe you're reaching a bit?  i think sanderson should be in on this. there's a reason why the killer's calling him.
they couldn't break the riddle.
did you think it was going to be easy? you think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
we need your help.
i offered my help this morning and sedman turned me down.
but you're the key.  the one he wants to play the game with.
i can't right now.  i've got a game.
she could be dead after the game.
she could be dead now.
what if she isn't?  where are your priorities?  you have to think between someone's life and a chess game?  the girl he killed last night was only twenty one years old!  he dumped her body behind a warehouse like a sack of garbage!
i don't think it matters.  last nights victim, christie eastman was found in a warehouse on the outskirts of town. the night before, debi rutlege was found in the center.
meaning?
meaning, it looks like his victims are chosen at random.
no.
what do you mean, no?
he says it's a game.  all games have a strategy.
all you gotta do is look at the map.
his victims aren't random.  it only means that they appear to be random. there's a connection, we just have to find it.
what have you come up with on the riddle?
"wee willie winkie runs though the street."  we think he might be making a reference to himself.
maybe, but i don't think so.  i think it's just a tease.
upstairs and downstairs in his night gown -- he could be saying the house he's picked is two stories.
that's it?
we think he might be making a reference to drugs?  miss emma is a street term used by junkies for morphine.
could emma be the name of the girl he's going to kill?
we've checked.  there's no one with the last name of emma on the island.
maybe he's going to drug her?
morpheus.
what?
not what -- who.  morpheus.  the greek god of dreams.  look at the next line. "her god has gone and left his home."
his home would be... mount olympus.
call dispatch.  double the patrols.  i want that area blanketed.
you sure you don't want to eat something?
i don't think i could.
it's going to be a long night.  it could take hours before we know something.  you should try to eat.
you sound like my mother.
it wasn't intentional.
does what's going on bother you at all? or are you just wearing your game face?
i think it's interesting.
another kind of game?
in a way.
this isn't a game.
oh, but it is.  he's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him.  that's a game.  it has rules and objectives.
how can you look at it so clinically?
take your average cop.  they deal with death everyday.  if they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
that's true -- but the emotion is still there.  they just learn to control it.
what about you?  aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
of course.
do you?
let's change the subject.
okay.  so, tell me about yourself.  are you married?
i'm just curious.
i think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- i want to keep things on a professional level.
you mean like in the steam room?
that's not fair!
are you going to tell me you didn't feel something in there?
you're projecting your own desires and reading more into what happened than what actually did.
very good.  spoken like a true psychologist.  when confronted with the prospect of your own reality, hide behind quotations.  what is that masters and johnson?
you have to win every point, don't you?
i just wanted to know if you're involved with anyone?  let me ask you something?  do your colleagues know if you're involved or not?
of course.
why?
because i work with them.
no.
you're not?
no -- i'm not involved.  and i plan on keeping it that way.
this is where he forced his way in.  we found some fibers on the windowsill, probably particles of clothing that rubbed off when he climbed through. i'll know more once i get it under the microscope.
that's great.
wait, i've saved the best for last. andy, hit the lights, will you?
before we go in i gotta tell you this isn't going to be pretty.
i know that.  i've seen the photo's.
this ain't no photo.
same as the others?
yeah.
how long she been dead?
i'd say at least eighteen hours.
that means she was dead before we even finished figuring out the message.
we got a problem?
our computer went on the fritz again. david came up to fix it.
is it serious?
naw, it's all fixed.  i also loaded up a program that'll analyze your games three hundred percent faster.
thanks.
what's this?
oh, i put a few games on for your daughter.  i hope you don't mind.
of course not.
don't you have something you want to say to david?
thanks, david.
you ready?
for what?
you told me you'd take me over to seattle today.
i'm sorry, honey, i can't.  not today.
but you promised.
peter...
i've got be here for the police when they come.  then i've got to practise. in case you forgot i'm in the middle of a match right now.
you're always in the middle of a match.
i want to be the best i can.
relax.
how the hell can i relax after seeing what i just saw.
i know it was bad.
how could you?  unless you were there.
i know you didn't
you know, andy thinks you're doing this.
doesn't that scare you?
no.
why?
because i think he's wrong.
hello?
do you know what i'm doing right now, peter?  i'm looking at the name of the girl i'm going to kill tonight.
you know her?
not really.
why her?
because she's the type.
but you said you didn't know her.
i know what i said!  she looks just like...
just like who?
i really wish you'd stop trying to maneuver me.  i find it irritating, not to mention insulting.
i'm just trying to play the game.
you're not playing very well.  there are clues all around you and you keep missing them.
i'm sure there are other people who would be interested in what i have to say.
then call them!
are you crazy?
let's see how much he wants to play.
just for that no hint today.
why are you doing this?  you must have some idea of the pain you're causing people.
pain?  pain is just a state of mind. it's something you learn to live with. i have.
and you want these girls to feel your pain?
please, i don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. it would detract from the game.
how?
i couldn't say it any better than huxley.
huxley's quote also says, "his play is always fair and just."
so is mine, within the framework of my rules.
what in the hell do you think you're doing?  slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
you think you're going to catch him on a trace?  everything he does is planned out well in advance.  the only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
you never know how you're going to catch a suspect.
peter's right, captain.  he's got to be forced into making a mistake.
we didn't ask for your opinion, doctor.
maybe you should.
you don't tell us how to run our investigation.  you got that?
you don't have an investigation without me.  you got that?
well, i think you have to play to his ego.  he thinks he's superior.  the more secure he feels, the more chances he'll take.
what did he mean by huxley?
can you go fifteen minutes without thinking about it?
no.  but i'm open to distractions.
i'm sure you are.
you know, you're not the easiest person in the world to get close to.
you always want to talk about me.  what about you?
wasn't i just talking about me?
no.  you were talking about chess.
alright.  what about me?
i dunno.  where's erica mother?
she died in a car accident.
i'm sorry.
it's alright.  it was a long time ago.
it must've been very hard on erica?
it was.
and you?
what?
have you noticed that every time we start to talk about something serious you start to play games.
i'm not playing a game now.
yes you are.  you're playing word games.
what is this?
i'm just trying to get to know you, peter.
what?  by attacking me?
nobody could attack you.  you set your life up like one of your chessboards. you're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  you're cut off from everyone around you.
what are you talking about?  you don't even know me.
does anyone?
i just don't want to fight with you.
then show me who you are.
this frightens me -- because i'm starting to feel things i haven't felt in a long time.
you've got to face the things you feel.
i thought you were the woman who didn't want to get involved.
i said i didn't plan on getting involved.
you can turn everything around so easily.  this is not just another game, is it?
no.
i'm hungry.
call room service.
fine.
what do you want on it?
you.
would you settle for pepperoni?
if i have to.  i'm going to take a shower.
did you call?
the line was busy.  i'll try again.
they're not delivering.  i'm going to go pick up the pizza.
i thought you said the line was busy?
i tried again and got through.
what's wrong?
nothing.
then why are you backing up?
peter, you have to admit--
--admit what?  that i was right about you in the steam room?  that you're willing to do anything to find out what you want?  would you like me to leave so you can search the rest of the room?
peter...
how could you think that, kathy?  how could you even consider it?
you know, i figure that's pretty much how these girl's feel just before they get it.  you think i'm right?
i wouldn't know.
that's right.  i guess only the killer would know that.
how'd you get in here?
the door was open.
no it wasn't.
of course it was.  otherwise i'd be breaking and entering.  that's a felony.
what do you want?
you ever do any hunting, peter?
no.
i used to.  with my old man.  he taught me how to hunt and trap.  trapping's a lot harder than most people think.  we used to go after raccoons mostly. they'd get into our garbage, our fields.  when an animal can't live peacefully with those around it, it has to be destroyed.  but they're crafty little devils.  you see the trick is, you can put your trap down, but no raccoon is going come near it unless you lay down the scent.  you ever smell raccoon scent?  smells like shit, but to a male raccoon it smells just like pussy.  he'll walk right up to that trap, even though it don't look nothing like a raccoon and stick his goddam head right in it.  you know why?  cause he can't help himself.  the scent drives him.  so, if you want to catch a raccoon all you gotta do is figure out where he is -- lay down the scent -- and sooner or later he'll walk right into the trap.
what if he doesn't bite?  what if he's an exceptionally bright raccoon?
well then, you just gotta find out where he is -- and once you're sure where he is -- you shoot the fucker.
you have something you want to say?
just thought you might want to talk.
about what?
whatever's on your mind.
who says something's on my mind.
what do you see here?
mate in five.
exactly... and you did this.
it isn't kathy.
who's kathy?
if you can think of anything else give us a call.
you know, i hate to say i told you so, but i warned her.  coming home at all hours of the night.  a young girl new to the city.  this neighborhood ain't what it used to be.
a few people.
did anyone stand out?
what do you mean, stand out?
did anyone look suspicious?  think!
now that you mention it there was somebody who looked suspicious.
what was suspicious about him?
excuse me... you said earlier that mary albert just moved in.  how long ago was that?
ten days ago.
do you know how she found the apartment?
through a rental agency.
didn't you tell me that debi rutlege had just moved into her place also?
you must be erica.
uh huh.
i'm kathy.
is your dad here?
he went down to the lobby for a minute. he should be right back.  would you like come in?
so, are you having a good time on the island?
not really.  it's pretty boring.
that's only because you don't know where to go.  you like hiking?  fishing?  sailing?  what do you like?
boys.
do you like my dad?
of course.
i know he really likes you.
how do you know that?  did he say something?
no... but i can tell.  a woman knows these things.
okay.  nice meeting you.
nice meeting you.
another one?  what word did he leave?
"is".  did you tell him about the institute?
have you any idea what the message is?
if it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
i couldn't tell you that.  it would ruin the game.  not that you're playing it very well.
you like to brag, don't you?
what?
you heard me.  why did you go out to the institute looking for her?
what makes you think i was there?
i couldn't tell you that.  it would ruin the game.
the game's almost over, peter, and you're running out of time.
it's you who's running out of time. you're starting to make mistakes now. you're wondering just how much i really know.  just how close i'm getting? well, i'm closer than you think, pal -- and i'm gonna nail your ass to the wall!
very nice speech, peter.  did you rehearse that, or was it impromptu?  there's an old wooden bench in the garden.  next to it is a rock.  you'll find a message for you under it.  let's see if you're as clever as you think you are.
in a fierce magazine you'll find a hint of my actions to come... why does he set this line apart?
for emphasis?
exactly.  it's the key.
but what does he mean by a fierce magazine?  violent?
a fierce magazine... brutal...  an angry magazine... a war magazine... a mercenary magazine...  fierce...  mad.
what?
where's the note?
you got it on the board.
no, i need the original note.
there's a photostat of the original on the wall.
as large as castles.  you are still light as air, one hundred men can't move me.
it doesn't make sense.
it doesn't make sense because we don't understand it.
but a hundred men could move him.
he's not talking about himself.
then what's he talking about?
if we knew that we'd know the answer to the riddle, wouldn't we?  he's telling us where he's going to kill tonight and we can't see it.
maybe we should back up a minute and take a look at what we do have.  all the girls that have been killed have been killed at night.  they're all the same type.  all moved into their homes within the last three months -- and all of them found their homes through homesearchers.
i thought that homesearchers was a dead end?
it can't be a coincidence.  the woman that owns it has a son.  she says he's been on vacation in montana for the last ten days.  we're trying to locate him.  there's also a cleaning service that comes in once a week.  we're checking that out too.
he moves around a lot.  why?
he's using the map as a chessboard! the sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
how can he be playing chess with you? you're not making any moves against him.
maybe i already have.
sure.  we've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in new york.
can we correlate data?  look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
no problem.  we're in.
okay.  run a search to see if there are any players with a rating above two thousand that live on the island.
nope.  nothing.
set up some pieces on the big board?
i still don't see how he could be playing chess against you.  there's only enough grids on the map to be half a board.
that's all he needs.  he's making the moves.  it's an opening.  i just can't remember the name.  okay, it's a game.  he's starting it, so he moves first.  he's white.  e2-e4.
d2-d4...  b1-c3... and c1-f4.  it's the number two variation of the tarakoss opening.  david, can you bring up the tournament records for the last ten years.
mister sanderson, they'll be hundreds of thousands of games.
now what?
have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  there can't be more than a handful.
there's three.  the first is 1983. lionel baines.  the boston...
never mind.  he died two years ago.
1985.  hans korshaud.
he's in his seventies and lives in holland.
what is it?
new york.  1986.  viktor yurilivich.
he's replaying the game i played against him move by move, using these girls as the chess pieces.  all the girls have been found in their homes except christie eastman, who was found in back of a warehouse.  why?
because to follow the game he played he had to move to that grid?
right.  here!  c-4.
it's a commercial area.  no one lives there.
but he had to dump the body there to make the move.
each of those grids represents almost a square mile.
that's a big area to cover.
then let's narrow it down.
homesearchers.
you want me to what?
i want you to feed every street in this grid into your computer.
it'll take hours.  you can't make me do this.
you're right, i can't make you do it. besides, you're probably gonna be too busy with the franchise tax board anyway.
what are you talking about?
i gotta friend over there.  he was telling me things are kind of slow. so, i figured i'd give him a call, have him come down here and look through your records.  you know, give him something to do.
what's the first street?
as large as castles, you are still light as the air, one hundred men can't move me.  it's posed as a question. what am i?
a building?
a building isn't as light as air. what's large, but as light as air and can't be moved?
as large as castles.
yes.  why not just say a building if he meant any general type of structure?
he's not going to give us direct hints. he's going to skirt around it.
he uses castles...plural --  then says "can't move me."  singular.  not can't move us.
a shadow.  what's as big a castle?  as light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  the shadow of the castle.  are there any buildings that have the name castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
wait a minute.  there's an apartment in that area called the castle arms.
that's got to be it.
how is she?
she's unconscious, but they think she's going to make it.
you alright?
i've seen a lot of things in my time on the job, but nothing like this. yurilivich?
i was with him the whole time until i got the call at the hotel.
sanderson?
i spoke to jeremy.  he's watching sanderson's kid.  sanderson went out after the match and hasn't come back since.
find him!  i want to talk to him.
hi.
can i come in?
the other night -- i said some things that maybe i shouldn't have.  i mean, you haven't known me very long and i can see how you thought what you did.
i'm not looking for an apology, peter.
i was thinking that... maybe when this is all over we could...
i want someone i can get close to. i don't know if that's possible with you.
you really haven't seen my best side.
peter...
no, listen.  you have no idea of the kind of pressure i'm under right now.
that's still no excuse.  you treat everything like a game.
i can't think any more, unless it's about you.  i'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, i think about how you look when you smile.  remember how you said that i hide behind my chessboard?  ever since my wife died i've been...  i've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
you're wife died.  you can't feel responsible for that.
you don't understand.
then help me to understand.  i want to understand.
it's not that easy.
of course it isn't.  it's always difficult when someone you love dies. but you can't feel responsible because she had a car accident.
but i do.
why?
because she killed herself!!
this letter.  i've never opened it.
why not?
because i know what it says.
maybe you're afraid of what it says.
she went into town with mrs. lutz.  did they get him?
no.
feel like practicing?
yeah.  just let me grab a shower.
where were you last night?
are we going to go through this again?
answer the question.
i went out.
don't fuck with us!  where did you go!
he was with me?
what time did he get there?
about a quarter to one.
we're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
i was at the beach.
you sure you weren't over on pine road?
i'm positive.
you're a lying bastard!
fuck you!  i'm tired of your goddam accusations!  if you want to arrest me go ahead!  otherwise back off.
it's all a big game isn't it?  a sick, fuckin' game.  i don't know if there's two of you involved, or what -- but we're going to find out.  last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place.  it must've shocked the hell out to you when frank walked in on pine road and you couldn't finish.
yes you are.
get off me!
hello.
last night was very exciting, wasn't it?  have you figured out what i'm doing?
you're playing the tarakoss opening.
very good.
you're next move should have been e2- e3.
i used a variation.  you should have anticipated that.  have you figured out the message?
what word did you leave last night?
the police haven't told you?
they think that you and i are doing this together.
interesting concept.  i hadn't thought of that.  if you think about how anton berger plays chess you might get it.
i'm beginning to think it doesn't mean anything.  remember eventually revenge- -
--you're hopeless!  you can't even read a sentence!  didn't they teach you punctuation in school?  the game ends tonight!
remember eventually revenge is carefully...  have you tired juxtaposing the words?
oh, c'mon.  we're not going to spend any more time on this crap, are we?  it doesn't mean anything.  it's sanderson!
it isn't him.  frank, you brought me in on this in the beginning because you wanted my opinion if he was capable of doing this.
jesus, you're sleeping with the guy. you've lost your perspective.  you can't possibly be unbiased.
he's right, kathy.
what are you saying?  that i'm seeing what i want to see?  that i'm protecting a murderer?  what?
we can't rely on your judgement anymore.
what does that mean?
and what if he's wrong.  if you were one hundred percent sure it was peter you would've arrested him.  if it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
we're going to work on the message.
this stinks!  you want to know what i think?  i think there have been five murders and you've got shit to go on. you need to blame someone and he's the easiest choice.
the most logical choice.
you don't have a shred of evidence!
we'll find the evidence.
you couldn't find your dick in a wind storm!
if we could just figure out what the next word is going to be.  he said the game's going to end tonight so there's only going to be one more word.
it could be anything.
it's got to be grammatically correct.
how did you know it was "carefully"?
frank told me.
no he didn't.
you're right.  the killer told me.
he didn't tell you either.
this isn't going to be like the phone book, is it?
of course not.
you're going to be late for your match.
are you going to come tonight?
yeah.  i'll be there later.
bainbridge books.
hi, sara.  this is doctor sheppard.  i was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "principals and tactics" by anton berger.
i can check and call you back.
thank you.  i'm at 639-7393.
we'll call you back.
did you see his face?
no.  he was wearing a mask... but i saw the cut on his wrist.  it was peter.
i can't arrest someone for having a cut on their wrist.  do you have someone you can stay with tonight?
i've got a room at the institute i use when i stay late.
okay.  why don't you go out there. we'll check in with you later.
what is it?
it's a voice modulator.
feeling better?
i just can't believe it.
you don't want to believe it.  it's a normal reaction.
how come the police never had a record of sanderson before.  this doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
jeremy would have never killed himself.
maybe he just got tired of covering for you.
this is insane!  can't you see what's going on.  the killer wants me out of the way.  he's setting me up.
you set yourself up tonight when you attacked kathy, you crazy fuck!
what?
bainbridge books.
sara, this is doctor sheppard.  i called you earlier about a book.
yes, doctor sheppard.  we called you back but you weren't home.  we have the book.
could you please do me a big favor?  in the first chapter the author mentions his three rules of chess.  could you look and tell me what they are?
of course.  yes, here it is.  why, they're all the same?
what are they, please?
"carefully".  "carefully". "carefully".
hello, peter.
you sonofabitch!
emotional?  i expected more from you.
if you kill tonight and i'm in jail the police will know i'm innocent.
by that time the game will be over.
i've figured out the message.
no you haven't.  and even if you had it doesn't matter.  who would you tell? the police don't believe you, and you've just used your only phone call.
ready for round two?
i've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  let him sweat for a little while.
kathy, please.  you're going to wear a hole in the carpet.
i'm just nervous.  sorry.
you're safe.  he wouldn't come here.
he already did once.
why did he?
why did he what?
come here.
he was watching you.
yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  what if i had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
you're losing me.
the message!  i figured out--
sit down!
don't you understand what i'm telling you?  that's why he wants me out of the way.
i understand that this is just another one of your games.
look, i'll do anything you want!  i'll sign anything you want!  just send a car out to the hotel.
alright, c'mon peter.  we're moving you to a cell.
i signed the confession.  what about the car?
did you send the car?
it's over, peter.  let's stop the games.  i'm not sending a car.
yes?
congratulations on your daring escape. you just missed me by a few seconds.  it's check, peter.
let me speak to my daughter.
she's in the other room.  i just wanted you to know she wasn't dead... yet. but it's time for her to die now.
please... wait.
the game's over.  you lost.
it's me you want.  not her.
no.  as usual you're wrong.  it is her i want.  killing you would be easy. living with the consequences of losing will be much more of a defeat.
that wouldn't be very sporting. remember huxley?  "his play is always fair and just."
you're groping.  i have been fair. it's my move now.
i'll give you anything you want. anything!  please!
don't beg, peter.  she has to die.  i can't win unless she dies.
i was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but i've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when i kill her. good-bye peter.
no!  wait!!
i know where you are.
very good.  how did you know?
the pipes.
how'd you know i wouldn't be in the same room with her?
you told me.  when you called you said she was in the other room.  drop the knife.
computers.  that's how you got into homesearchers records.  you can get into anything.  but why?  why?
you still haven't figured it out, have you?   you think that i've put you through an ordeal.  my scars run so much deeper than yours.
what scars?
the scars on your chest.  from where i stabbed you with my fountain pen.
this isn't going to help, david. you're mother's dead.  you can't undo it.
you don't understand.
yes, i do.  i found your file.  i know what happened.
they took away the game because of him. my father left and my mother...  there was so much blood... it covered everything.
i know, but this isn't going to bring her back.
don't you see?  i had to make it right. i ignored my mother's crossing.  i sat with them all.  i held their hands.  i stroked their hair.  i was with them to the end.  i took away the blood.  i washed them.  their crossing was peaceful.
i think your mother knows that now. why don't you put the knife down.  put it down, david.
you beat him.
i got lucky.
there's a girl in the hospital who is going to live because of you.  you made a difference.
it's over now.
i just wanted you to know in case you thought about it in the future.
do we have a future?
