test the product?
yeah.
sounds like you don't trust me.
business is business.  now where the hell is it?  i wanna get out of here.  that's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what i'm saying?
you didn't answer my question. are you saying my word is of no value to you?
you said that, i didn't.
i have a better plan.  you want to hear it?
what?
i have a better plan.
and what's that?
how about you give us what you have and leave.
what?
am i speaking english here?  how-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
what is this?  don't be stupid man...
first you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
i have to go to the bank before it closes.
what for?
i gotta take some money out, that's what for.
there's an atm on speedwell avenue.
yeah but i need to take out four hundred dollars and the atm will only give me three.
well, not that i wouldn't sugar bun but earl's in a bind.  they're going to take his car.
he's irresponsible.
ah hell, he'd do the same for me.
has he?
no.  but he would, probably.
get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
i might have to look into that...
just goes to show you.
i mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye won’t immediately look.
damn it’s hot in here...
he probably figured she was on her way out anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play.
very clumsy, very clumsy.  i’d have found it in a minute.
all right you’re the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
no.  but what i would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and i’m a busy man.
dammit you’re persistent.  i don’t want to listen to this anymore.  no more bets with you.
aw, now that’s gonna take time to clear!
take it or leave it.
do you even have a girlfriend, jesse?
sort of.
sort of!
hey dwayne why don't you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
she's not his type.
yeah.  that's all i need, to become one of your in-laws.
all right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.
don't worry the real men are in charge now.
speaking of which that reminds me i have to bring something home or eat sally's meatloaf again, and i don't think i could stand that.
ready to roll, partner?
sure thing, and --
don't spend it all in one place.
i knew you'd come through. jesse observes the transaction booth and earl start to leave.
how old is otis anyhow, thirty?
the horniest dog in nevada.
thanks for the loan, man.  i'll have it in a few days, i promise.
well i hope so.  that pretty much cleaned me out.
i would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
i hear you.
yeah...i remember my brother-in-law gary, the wheel watcher.  he finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  plus some leather furniture. do you think i saw any of that?  his excuse was the government got it all.
seven thousand...
he would have won more but he blew it at the end.  didn't know what cash and carry was.
cash and what?
cash and carry, you know, fdr, world war two...
never heard of it.
oh, you would have done great.
i probably would have.  i guess the clues damn near before everyone.
that's what everyone thinks.  but according to him, when it's the real thing, it's quite an intimidatin' environment in which to concentrate.
what the hell...
they're out of towners... arizona plates...
ten thousand right here.
there must be over a million dollars in here.
shit, more than that.
what are we going to do?
what do you mean what are we going to do?
i mean -- earl grabs booth's arm --
call it in i guess.  why?
why?  are you kidding me?
no.  we can't.
look around you partner!  you said yourself you never saw anything like it.
we don't know whose money it is!  they might have robbed a bank, who knows?
robbed a bank, c'mon!  don't you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit i don't know how many were at large!  don't you think there would be a bulletin?  this is a big ass drug deal!
we don't know that.
come on booth!  look at these scumbags around us.  who's going to know what happened!  let's take it and get out of here!
well someone's gonna find them.
hell, it won't be us!
it won't work.
why?
i told trudy we were coming down this way, that's why!
we'll figure something out.
we would never have to worry about money -- ever again, jesus!
suppose someone knows about the money?  they're bound to ask questions.
who's going to question us? dwayne?  jesse?
it's going to go bigger than that. could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
i'll worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it's not gonna happen!
what makes you so sure?
because...i know.
it's no accident we stumbled on this money.  it's an answer to a prayer!  every night and every day i've prayed that god would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  tonight my prayer came true.
oh so god's like western union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
that's right!
at the expense of six people.
they killed themselves.  besides, they were breaking the law.  what they were doing was wrong!  whatsamatter booth, don't you believe in miracles?
all right hold on!  lemme think...  shit, did you touch the car?
maybe.  who cares?
i do.  it's little shit like that sends people to jail! we have to cover all the bases if we're going to pull this!
all right we will.
we'll torch the bases, how's that?
torch it?!
we'll leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  car went up in the gunfight.
i don't know.
i've got one condition.
what's that?
we're going to be patient. if we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.
well, we won't do any of that shit!
shhh!
what are you gonna do?
well, i don't know.  i'm putting it out of my mind and you should too --
i don't know!  son of a bitch! who the hell are you?
he saw everything!
how long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? answer me!
he'll tell them everything to save his ass. that's how they all work it!
i'm not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  we can't risk it.
what are you thinking?
i don't know...
you're thinking about killing him.  i can't do that.  no way.  i've never killed a man.  never even shot at one...
well neither have i, but it's us or him.  if he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  besides, he's a low life scumbag.  his kind is hardly even human anyway.
i...i can't do that.
okay then.  i'll do it.
that's not what i mean.
listen. do you want to go to jail? taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  you know what they'd do.
what the hell happened here?
looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they're not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
i'd like to know what they were doing in my town!  did you get id off any of them?
none of them had any --
damn.
i want to get some hounds down here.
why?
cause we got footprints leading into that brush, i want to see where it leads...  jesus, seven dead.  i'll tell you i've never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  i don't like it.  not in my jurisdiction.
i tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --
i don't want to hear about miracles and god and all that!  we tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
well we didn't kill him, he died on his own.
look.  dwayne was right.  this is going to be a big story.  so big in fact that i don't want to even have this money around.
fair enough, i'll take it to my place.
forget it.  we're going to bury it, and we're not going to even think about it until everything dies down.  and no one, i mean no one hears a word about it.	 understand?
hi.
hi.
heard you had quite a night.
yeah.
it was all over the local news. dwayne was there, acting all official.
i know.
what's wrong?
nothing.
nothing's wrong.
oh.  you coming by tonight?
ok.
are you sure you're ok?
yeah i'm fine.
i'm just tired is all.  i'll see you tonight ok baby?
ok.  i love you.
i love you too.
how are ya?
hello.
i guess we can get started.
i wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
thank you.  now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?
no.  why?
because someone may have gotten away.
what makes you say that?
we had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. and there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
could it have been in the mercedes?
maybe.  that's where it was during denning's last report.
normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. the last we heard from him was two days ago.
you mean that guy was an agent?
yes.  wife and a kid.  don't blame yourself, deputy.  you did all you could.  you have our deepest gratitude...and my personal thanks.
well, we have one lead and that's what i'm looking into next.
what's that?
denning was wearing a bug.
he kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who's who, what was said, what's happening.  i contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
that's news to me.  so it's over at jesse's office?
yeah.  i told him i'd be there before five.
excellent. i'll go down with you.
we're dead.  we're dead, we are dead...  what are we going to do?!
i don't know...
this isn't a joke. what are we going to do!
i don't know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  we're going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...
that guy was a federal agent. an officer of the law, just like us.
well, we didn't know that at the time.
we assaulted a federal agent.  we killed him.
no we didn't.  he died on his own.
oh, right, with a little help from his pals booth and earl.  i'm sure that's gonna fly real far when they hear that tape...
we gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
are you nuts?  they'll fry us for sure.  there's no way we're doin' that, you understand?  no way.
it's the right thing to do.
it's the stupid thing to do, that's what it is.
i should have known something like this was going to happen!
man take it easy!  you're sweating like crazy!
i don't know.
this just might be our ticket!
well nothing audible to us.  maybe the lab can pick something up.
damn! martin i'm sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  i thought maybe it would help. booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- earl immediately plays up to martin, clearly relieved --
well we'd like to help you in any way we can.  we're all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
we appreciate that.
sally?  i was beginning to think he wasn't gonna leave.
i'm in here.
you got me something?  what's the occasion?
you deserve it is the occasion.
what happened to your cheek? sally oh i...nothing...
nothing happened?
dwayne got a little tipsy is all. he doesn't handle pressure well.  it's over.
like hell it's over.  you told me he wasn't doing this anymore.
he's not, he's...
that son of a bitch.
booth.  don't.  it's nothing. it's not worth it.  remember what happened the last time?
let's not get into this again. i know him.  if you said something, he'd take it out on me.
and i'd take it out on him.
and i'd end up a widow in two ways.  let's forget it.  i'll just be a little more careful next time.
there isn't gonna be a next time. we're gonna get out of here.
you're worth every last penny.
well, i can't let you down now, can i?
how long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? answer me!
he'll tell them everything to save his ass. that's how they all work it!
shit!  we're gonna have to get rid of him.  i'm not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  we can't risk it.
what are you thinking?
i don't know...
you're thinking about killing him. i can't do that.  no way.  i've never killed a man.  never even shot at one.
well neither have i, but it's us or him.  if he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he's gonna turn us in.  besides, he's just a low life scumbag.  his kind is hardly even human anyway.
i can't do that.
okay then.  i'll do it.
that's not what i mean.
listen.  do you want to go to jail? taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  you know what they'd do.
he would have done it to us, right?
exactly.  this is our little secret, partner.
you want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
give me the bad news.
we retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
anything in it?
money.
but nowhere near three million dollars worth.  i would say maybe twenty thousand.
there was more than that.
not in the trunk.
that doesn't tell us much. did you run a check on the gas like i told you?
yeah, we did.  it was unleaded, high octane.
so...what's the good news?
that fire was set.  deliberately. and probably not by anyone found at the scene.
so someone did get away.
i don't know how else you'd explain it.  the coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
no, it doesn't.  neither does his blank tape.  any news on that?
we're doing a check on the manufacturers'	serial number, see if there were other defective tapes in the bunch.  what's your take on these local boys?  are they providing any answers?
you gentlemen look like you're about to toss your collective cookies.
why don't you get to the point.
my point, well...
hey we're all friends, right? friends don't squeal on friends, that's not what jesse segundo is all about.
then what the hell are you all about?
listen earl.  i covered for you. for both of you.  i put my ass on the line to save yours, so don't pull a hostile tone with me!
what's your offer, jesse?
my offer?  well i'd say it's a fair one, like i said we're friends.  all i want is my share, which i guess is...
i'll settle for a third of that.
and if we refuse?  your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
true, but neither is attempted murder. in fact i'd say that's considerably worse, wouldn't you, earl?
besides, i'm not stupid, earl. the tape was a basic maxell d-80.  you can buy 'em at any store.  there's no way they can pin anything on me.
all right, jesse, we'll play it your way, under one condition.
i'm all ears.
we're going to wait.  all of us, until everything dies down.
well, i don't know...
that's the deal.  if you don't like it, forget it, no one wins.
ok...i'll wait.  for now. but i'm going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.
how much?
i understand your logic, booth, but i don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
two thousand...
by friday.
what's this?
i don't know...
hey where's the hot pad?
what?
where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
i can't hear a word you're saying!
forget it.
it was going to be a surprise!
a surprise huh?  well i don't like any surprises, especially if i'm forking over the loot for them!
what are you saying?
i'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
watch that.  watch that tone.
i could kill that no good son of a bitch!
all right enough!  i'm tired of thinking about all this!
well i'm not!  thinks he's got us by the balls.
well doesn't he?  besides if the dea heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  just call it the cost of doing business.  this whole thing is screwed up.  i'm thinking.  maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
...or get rid of the money.  i don't know.
i've got a better idea.  all we have to do is straighten out jesse.
and how do you figure we do that?
all we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  we'll set him up somehow.
he's probably made copies.  he's not going to give them up to us.
forget the copies!  he could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
he's going to be trouble.
he's a partner now, earl, like it or not.
we had a deal!  what was i, talking to the wall?
for christ's sake, booth, i just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  you got my word on it --i'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
you said that last time!
well i mean it this time.  come on.  let's get this over with!
i told him i bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  i don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
how the hell did he find it?
he started digging through my closet, something he never does.
great...
it's ok, booth, it's no big deal.
let's hope so. sally if he asks me again, i'm gonna tell him i returned it all.
dammit, i'm so sick of this.
i know.
every night i think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
he doesn't slobber, he just snores. and i told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
it doesn't matter...he's next to you.  you know, i always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. why didn't you?
i used to think he was something, once...  i was eighteen, i didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  we'll drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...
i hate it when you talk like this.  go on.
we'd... i don't know...go to california, new york, maybe a house on a swiss mountainside...
it'd have to be switzerland to make sure dwayne never finds us.
so do i.
i love you sally.
i love you.
a satellite dish?
well i was just throwing out ideas...
jesse?
yeah whaddya want?.
i'm at a payphone in vegas.  what's up?
vegas!  can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
why?
well, we got the dea coming down here again, i don't know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
about what?
well they really didn't go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and i figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
uh, sure.  i hear you.
so be here at three.
i'll do my best...that doesn't give me much time.
i  have complete faith in you. but don't you go speeding.
yeah...see you at three.
hi ma.
hi.
i didn't know you were coming.
i was in the neighborhood.
is that the mail?
yeah.
how's work?
well, same ol' same ol'.
people have been asking me about that story in the paper.  i told them you were the first person on the scene.  they were asking me for all the details.
it was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  but you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
did they ever find out who they were?
nope. if you're a criminal you don't carry id, and if you do you're a damn fool.
i tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
at least around here it does.
are you hungry?
yeah sure i'll grab something before i go...  hey -- i've got a surprise.
you do?
there was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, i forget, so i figure what the hell put in my five bucks...
and what happened?
well basically i forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well...
well what do you know!  an air conditioner.
and not just any air conditioner. this baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
that's great earl!
yep, fifteen thousand btu's, enough to cool off this whole place.
this whole place?
yeah.  figured you could have it.
don't you want it?
ah, hell i'll get one soon enough.  besides, i want you to have it.
well i don't know --
you've done without it long enough, ma.
thank you honey.  are you sure you don't want it?
absolutely positively.
nice of you to join us.  i did say three o'clock, didn't i?
well i'm here now.
uh, no...
don't you think i would have told you that!
yeah?  so?
it's odd.  i don't know how denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
maybe.  maybe not.
what are you getting at?
well, unfortunately denning's not here to tell us, but i would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
why would someone do that?
because they don't want anyone to hear what's on it, obviously.
something wrong, jesse?
no.  something wrong with you dwayne?
you walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
well, i just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
what do you think about all this?
hell, i don't know.  if i had some input i'd offer it up.
whatsamatter with you?  aren't you concerned about all of this?
i can't get enough of it.
we're out of here.
right behind you.
oh that was agent wallace.  we're going to check into something.
maybe i should come along.
don't you have to be here?
hell no. besides i'm just a radio call away if something happens. i feel i should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it's my jurisdiction and all.
mm-hmm...
meet me at the tumbleweed diner.
what?
just do it!  meet me there, now.
there's going to have to be a change in our arrangement.
what are you proposing?
i want my share. all of it.
i'm not asking.
well you're not getting, either.
listen -
i don't like getting grilled by that dea bitch, i don't like taking that kind of heat!
none of us like it!
well i don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
just take it in stride.
i'm not gonna take --  i'm not gonna take it in stride.  i had a good run turn to shit on me like that -  cleaned me out.
what do you mean?  you gambled it?
i was on a roll!  i’m a little overextended now.
oh jesus christ...
so i want the money and i want it now.
well you can't have it.
you're out of your mind.
yeah, i mean you're coming unglued, jesse.
you want to see how more unglued i can get?  try me.
you're never getting that much.
i think i am.
you think he's bluffing?
no.
neither do i.
look, earl.  we gotta go straight. this is all messed up...
if you're any friend at all, you'll stop talking like that!
maybe we can reason with jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
i don't think he's going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  besides, i'm not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
well what are we supposed to do?
i don't know...we have to shut him up somehow. booth looks at earl --
you're crazy.
how badly do you want that money?! how bad do you want to stay out of jail?
not bad enough to kill him.
who said anything about killing?  just keep driving straight...
mr. curtis called us this afternoon. the bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  came through a store called after midnight.  there's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
is this marked money, or what?
some of it.  denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
so there was money there!  who the hell's money is it?!
we don't know.  whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system.
have you known this all along?
well you can understand why we didn't say anything.  if word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
well yes i understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
sheriff hogan --
dwayne.
dwayne...  it is imperative that we keep this confidential.	now we know someone's out there.  very close. it may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
fine.  the information doesn't leave this room.
ok...this is good.  our first solid lead.
did you say after midnight?
yeah.
what the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
not exactly.  it's some lingerie store on the strip.
lingerie...
yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
sure... dissolve to ext hogan house -- night
nothing.  nothing's the matter. sally aren't you going to tell how your day went?
not much to tell.  nothing really happened.
that hasn't stopped you before.
suppose i'm not exciting enough for you.
i didn't say that.  you did.
well you might as well say it. mister small time...
just trying to be civil dwayne.
don't you want to hear about my day?
yeah let's hear about your day.
well i got the tires rotated, i went shopping, and i made dinner.
whatever...
look i worked all day, i'm tired as hell and i want to sit and eat in peace!  is that asking too much?
no, dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the tv, and come upstairs and pass out.  and do it all over again tomorrow!
save me the sermon.  i've heard it all before, it's boring.
it certainly is...
i was beginning to think you weren't going to show.  that can't be all of it.
no.  it's not.
what the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --
we're gonna talk.
i don't suppose you'll tell us where the tape is.
well it's not here -- you're wasting your time and you're pissing me off!
you don't expect us to believe that do you?
you better believe it if you know what's good for you!
how long is it going to take?!
i don't know!  shit, give me a break!
come on, booth.  don't let him do this!!!
don't have much choice, jesse. you saw to that!
you're only screwing yourselves over!  helllllp!  helllllp!  somebody!!!
shut up, jesse.
helllllp!!!!
don't hurt me.
we gotta, jesse.  it's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice.  we gotta know where the tapes are.
easy to purchase, hard to detect. too much potassium can kill a man.  just have to...pick a discreet spot.
stop!  stop!  i don't need the money.  you can have it all.
whoa, earl!
okay! it's under my desk!!  taped to the bottom side!!!
what are you doing, earl?
what are you thinking?  we were only supposed to scare him!
i'm just making our intentions clear. go check the desk.
here it is.
there it is...now what about the others?
even if we have the tape, that wouldn't shut him up!
you killed him...
it's gonna be o.k.
like hell it is.  this is jesse! jesse!
jesus christ earl...what are we doing?...
we're doing what we gotta do, to protect ourselves!
you don't know if he was really gonna --
yes i do!  it never woulda stopped, you know that.  jesse's always gonna be making mistakes and we'd be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
maybe we should say somethin'.
come on. booth grabs the bag --
do you have everything?
i sure as hell hope so.  let's go.
hello.
hi.
anything i can help you with?
well i just uh, you know...
i have an anniversary coming up, thought i'd buy her something special.
anything...specific?
well i don't know...
sixty five...  jeez louise!
we are having a sale on some items over here --
yeah, she is.  she comes up to about here on me.
hmmm...
i don't suppose you've seen her.
have i seen her?
shopping here?
no, i can't say that i have.
oh.
let's see...do you know her cup size?
uh...c?
c?
yeah i'd say c...c.
do you know...34 c?  32 c?
no i don't.  you sure you haven’t seen her?
well...i should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
sure.
i'm just not very good...with all of this stuff.
oh, that's ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
a lot of men come in here?
oh yeah.  between here and vegas we get a lot of customers.  all types.  even had an officer, just like you.
yeah, i've seen him.
what did he buy?
i don't remember.  we get a lot of people in here.
could it have been this?
be more specific.  a month, a week...
a week ago, at most.
thanks for your time.
he didn't make it into work, and he's not home.
i knew it, i knew it all along - shit!
you think he skipped town?
we're going to find out.
how are we going to do all this?
i'm going to quit.  that's what has to happen first.  then we're going to tell him.
i don't know, booth.
i'll be there for you.  he won't try anything while i'm there.  i promise.  i'll protect you.
when do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
shouldn't be long.  a couple of weeks maybe.
can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
it'll be more than enough.  we can get out of here...
yeah.
what do you think?  heart attack?
this isn't right...
i'm not getting an answer.
not getting an answer?  for christ's sake!  call 911!  let's get it locked down here!
why does that bother you?
i'm not sure why.  it's just, i've never been anywhere else...
sally there's a whole world out there.  we can have a new home. a real home, not some tin-plated dump.  what are you giving up?
i don't know.  my friends...
we'll meet new people. you might have friends out there you never met.
yeah, i guess you're right.  it's just...all so sudden...
yeah, it is...
i don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
it was all used.  random numbers. how can they trace it?
i don't know.  they got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
then we're screwed.
no we're not.
we're not?  how do you figure that?
we'll take the money and disappear! we can do it, spend it on the move. even if all of it's marked, there's ways around it.
we've got to go now, then.
that's right.
then sally comes too.
do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
yeah.  i want to tell you everything.
things just got a little screwed up, that's all.
i don't believe it.
i swear to you, it's true...
sally, do you love me?
you know i do.
you shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
dwayne put the gun down --
shut up!!!  slut!!!
you'd do this to me?!
dwayne -
you'd do this to me!
i should kill you right here! i never thought you'd do this to me but i guess there's a lot i didn't know about you!
dwayne listen to me -
shut up!  not another word out of you!  you're going down, the feds know all about it!  you didn't know some of it was marked, did you! where's the rest?
i don't know what you're -
don't lie to me!!!!
dwayne please calm down!
calm down --
oh jesus...
he killed her...he killed her...
what happened?  what's earl doing here?
he found us, he shot her...he killed her...
booth, listen to me...booth!
he killed her...
we got to get out of here.  do you understand?  we got to get out of here right now!
no.  it stops now.  it stops here.
what do you mean?  look.  we can make still make it work.
dwayne's dead.
i know, i know.  dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it.  we'll pin it on him.  the dea was driving jesse's car. no car phone.  no radio.  they couldn't have called me in.
what are you talking about?
dwayne had the opportunity, just like us.  he was at the scene.  he grabbed the cash.  of course.  this is perfect!
it's too late...
it's not too late!
yes it is.  i'm calling it in.  right now.
you're the one who's nuts! there's no one left to touch us, booth.  we're home free!  we just plant a little of the money on dwayne, and it's all ours.
it's not about the money anymore. can't you see that?  it's about
just one more.  this one knocks off all the rest.
i can't.  i can't go on.  i can't keep lying...killing.  that's not me.  that's not us.
that'll bring me down, too. eventually.  you gotta know that.
uh huh.
and you're solid on that?
rock solid.
