know what the problem is, kid? you're too ugly to get propositioned.
look who's talking, old man.
c'mon, it's a quiet night.
next week we work the park.
i gotta get back on top. get off the sleaze detail.
you will, one day at a time. i'll be old and grey when it happens...
so what'll you do? after they give you the gold watch.
hell, i got a gold watch... it just don't work. maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
you don't fish.
how hard can it be? the grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
you outta the city... that's a fish out of water. what's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
one of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. when that happens, you'll wish you had family.
no thanks. i got close but it never woulda worked.
why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
what are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
i thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
she didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
what was it this time?
she wanted to cook me breakfast.
we're vice, i didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. but if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
nah, let's just take a look-see.
you okay?
yeah, just a nick ...
mike...
don't talk.
take your time... one day at a time, kid...
it don't work-
ain't that a shit--
prints?
nothing so far.
what about the ballistics report?
lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
captain...
reilly, what the hell happened out there? why didn't you call for back-up?
sir, i--
i want to work this.
you're vice, not homicide. besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
but sir--
looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in scranton.
maybe she knows your old man.
take it down to the bomb squad, artie-
i'll do it.
may i help you?
i'm looking for the bomb squad.
they're not here.
where are they?
and you are...?
officer reilly, vice.
there out on a call, perhaps i can help you-
-where?
f 2600 block of lakefront. a limousine. but, i-
thanks.
who the heck're you?
you the bomb squad?
no, we're terrorists, stay back or we'll blow.
we're a bit busy at the moment, i'll give you a statement in a few minutes if we're still alive.
reilly, vice. i-
quiet!
that guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
no shit. i better send meg flowers just in case.
he is!
look, it's important.
make an appointment.
it's about this.
where did you get this?
off a girl's wrist. a suspect...
p.e.t.n ...
what?
high-grade det cord. this girl, either she's got strange taste in jewelry or she's into serious demolition.
what do you mean?
sorry about that.  that's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
thanks.
vice... jesus.
that'd be some explosive pussy he's got his hands on.
what the hell was that?
a ticking bomb...
what?
it's detonation cord, for a bomb.
it's a bluff. the guy's full of crap.
we can't take the chance. ring down to the bomb squad. i want them on alert.
i'll do it.
goddamit, reilly--
look, i saw these guys, i can i.d. them.
i know you're anxious to get back but... just stay out of homicide's way or i'll have you classifying fingerprints, understand?
yes, sir.
bev, you're the greatest...
hey, i'm next.
hey, that's the guy-
we just got a bomb threat upstairs.
alright, let's check it out.
we can start in the area where the robbery occurred.
vice cop on a homicide?
captain assigned me to assist you.
assist? what the hell you know about tickers anyway?
easy, guys.
what're you talking about?
when you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
we've got one hour. are you coming or not?
what do you think?
call upstairs, see what you can find out.
right.
t.j., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
you touch me again and--
and what, you'll shoot me? hey, don't mistake me for one of your partners, i'd like to make retirement in one piece.
what the hell's going on?
son-of-a-bitch... my nose... this fuck-up is interfering with-
reilly, what're you doing here?
sir...
i thought i told you--
yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
hope you don't mind, captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  coming?
i'm filing charges against that mother-
can it, pluchinsky. and shove some cotton up your nose.
what was-? why...?
that cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
we've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
let's get something straight. we're doing you a favor. you're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
what?
this isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. you wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
now wait just a fucking-
be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. and try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
by the way, i'm glass. this is t.j., and pooch.
mike reilly.
nitro, dash of semtrex, vegetable oil ...
what kind of bomb was it?
device.
huh?
we don't use the b-word. bad luck.
so you're the "device squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
treat. we treat devices.
anything else i should know?
don't push it, slick.
pooch, can you move it?
i don't know...
good boy, schnoz. daddy loves you.
scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
c4, plastic explosive.
helluva fuck factor.
computer device?
unlikely. probably, cash register or something.
you were lucky today, vice boy. captain said to leave it alone, but just remember, i'm watching you.
i'm sorry, detective, but you're just not my type.
fuckin a, i think i got two partial prints here!
awright! how bout you, glass, how's that chip shaking?
glass, what is it?
i was wrong... this didn't come from any cash register.
whadaya mean?
it's from an ira.
oh shit...
a what?
ira - instant retirement account.
i.r.a. device. deadliest class of tickers in existence. computerized, multiple sensors, booby traps, the works. first showed up in a series of i.r.a. bombings in london couple years ago. one of their boys tripped it on himself and they went back to a less complicated timers. the girl, is she irish?
she's not talking. but, she could be. so, obviously, you've seen one of these devices before?
only once, at redstone.
where...?
that's one more time than any of the rest of us have seen it.
shit. we're fucked.
relax, pooch, it's just a ticker, it's not personal.
let's face it, we all knew it would happen sooner or later. the guy who can build a mousetrap that's better than we are ...
nice performance back there. where'd you learn that, mike ditka sensitivity seminar?
hey, look--
no you look, mister! first, you don't go calling my men names. it's bad for morale. second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
oh yeah? prove it.
drive.
the place has already be combed. forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
then let's go see what they missed.
so what were they doing here?
i don't know. you tell me?
an abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. low rent, too. but, you and rice ruined their perfect hideout.
you mentioned something called redstone.
redstone's the army training center in alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
cream of the crop, huh? you?
top of my class at west point, thank you very much. then off to redstone. first half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
sounds like terrorist heaven.
there were a few guys in my class with names like john smith, bill jones. i'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. c.i.a. funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
just how easy is it to build a... device?
with a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. heck, didn't you ever watch macgyver?
typical profile, usually losers, nobodies that're afraid to confront their victims. they like scaring people. that's why they call in their threats. same mentality as obscene phone callers.
except they'll blow you up if you don't play along.
no, ninety-ninety percent of them are full of baloney. they're into the power trip, not the damage. what scares me is that this guy is so sophisticated he could blow up whatever he wants, then disappear. the worst of the bunch, they love the challenge of creating the wildest device ever... and they love the carnage.
this is where the van was parked.
yep.
then, it's gotta be here somewhere ...
look, it's a longshot...
bingo!
nitro-cellulose. what is that, some kind of explosive?
industrial wood oil. separately, any one of these things could lead in several directions, but together ...
lane oil...
a bowling alley.
got it! ace match company, flint, michigan.
you mean you just--? ... you keep a record of... matches?
hey, matches are a very big thing in our line of work.
"punks", huh?
bev, give `em a call, find out what bowling alleys they supply in this area.
you got it.
we work fast enough for you?
t.j., what're you doing?
my first undercover assignment. i gotta look good, right?
so what're we looking for?
someone who smokes french cigarettes.
in this crowd? it's gonna be marlboros, camels, and maybe a few kools.
how long are we going to stay?
`til we get a better lead.
unsolved bombings in the last year... boston, new york, philadelphia... but no real match
insurance?
political.
exactly my thinking. except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. they seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. some insured, some not.
not bad for bomb squad, eh?
what not bad. you've got a series of bombs, devices, that may or may not be connected, set by one or many nutjobs, who may or may not be linked.
right.
well... it's more than we had ten minutes ago.
how're you guys doing?
still waiting for a miracle. go ahead.
you guys seem pretty tight.
we've gotta be. in this business, you don't exactly make alot of outside commitments.
why do you do it?
i don't know, it's strange... it's not the best career path, but when you get the bug, there's nothing you can do about it. see, when you beat one of these things...
looks like pooch's doing okay.
he's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
oh shit...
fuck factor ten.
so cut both.
one shuts it down, one turns arms it.
which one's which?
i don't know. there's an old saying, when in doubt, cut the yellow wire.
what do ay say?
meg's lasagna. good eats, reilly. c'mon.
what's this?
report on the case so far.
you know after a shooting i would normally take your badge and weapon, but glass called in already and confirmed it was clean.
yes, sir.
but from now on, any leads on this case go to pluchinsky. he's primary investigator and you are unofficially assigned to the bomb squad... you and your new friends are not to be playing detective any more. got it?
mike. no thanks, i'm fine.
time for bed, kiddos. say goodnight.
how long were you hooked?
what?
you don't have to talk about it.
pittsburgh, two years ago. partner died, no back-up, i was too gung-ho. as usual.
take a tip from the bomb boys, always assess, if only for a second.
i know. i was working a drug ring, deep cover. played the part too well. when they pulled me out, i wasn't a cop anymore. my fiance had dumped me. next thing i knew, i was out here on the street, doped up, auditioning for the morgue when this tough old vice cop found me, cleaned me up, gave me a second chance. he promised captain winters he'd look out for me.
your partner?
i guess i didn't realize how much i needed him. he kept me straight. it's been tough every second since.
i terrible with mechanical things.
no you're not, you just don't understand them. here, do what i tell you.
it's working.
congratulations, you just built your first ticker.
alright!
we've created a monster.
any word?
nothing. maybe they gave up, split town.
how's the print coming?
one partial from the handle matches the suspect from last night. name's carl taylor. long record of arson, assault, the works. the other print - we got nothing from our data base or the fbi or cia... still waiting for interpol.
damn.
coffee, mike?
no thanks, bev.
yes, sir.
she's refused to say a word to anyone. what made you think you could get her to talk?
i didn't. but i had to try.
cover.  it was suppose to be abandoned buildings, y'know. no one was suppose to get hurt. the night you busted us...we were checking to make sure there weren't any vagrants around. scare them away.
who is he?
alex swan. my brother. the other two are called taylor and leveau.
taylor's dead.
there is a motel downtown, near the machine shop... the suncrest. room 138.
thank you.
he's my brother...
then why tell me?
people are dying.
ex-girlfriend?
be right back.
glass, sorry about pooch, he was a good man. we don't have time to give you a break right now, we're going ahead and-
my god, you're going to use her, aren't you?
glass, you're to stand by with your team.
i promised her she'd be safe.
it's our only option.
it won't work, he'll know it's a trap...
reilly, you're done for now. what the hell were you thinking directing the bomb squad team into hot pursuit. they had no business-
i know.
you've been at the center of two suspect fatalities and two police officer fatalities. i'll need your badge and your weapon.
you okay?
alex-
i know. i warned them.
what is that?
security.
what's the matter?
nothing... just tired.
why are we stopping here?
we're moving' on. i have to pick up the supplies. just two little boxes.
no... no more killing.
stay here.
alex, please.
stay in the truck.
who are you calling, sis?
what? nobody, i-
alex, please-
shut up!  who is this?
dispatch, this is reilly.
go ahead.
patch me through to the bomb squad.
aren't you on suspension?
just do it.
hang on.
what's up?
where you guys at?
driving in circles, waiting for-
catch that alert? that's him in the u-haul.
how do you know?
cuz he got the girl, now he's leaving town.
should we head for the interstate?
would you?
no, i'd slip out past the hotel district, behind greyhound...
me, too.
glass, eighth street, alley behind grand hotel. cut him off.
you got it.
reilly, what the hell are you-?
fire me later. close in and we got the bastard.
pull back. you're only an observer.
reilly, what's happening? reilly! reilly! do not engage. we're five minutes-
we'll keep him pinned in, you guys hurry up!
jesus...
reilly! he's loaded!
drop it.
take him!
fuck factor?
off the scale.
what do we do?
talk to me. let's assess.
right.
c'mon, talk to me! we can do it!
he has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote.  okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.
good, now the other side.
nothing.
okay, let's go in.
keep talking.
close your eyes, feel your fingertips. tell me everything you feel.
wires... metal, cold... something soft...
don't touch that.
more metal... sharp edge...
stay to your left.
something round, two wires ...
that's the blasting cap - good! okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. no, wait...
what's wrong?
too easy. there's gotta be something else in there, another cap maybe.
make up your mind, trigger.
yeah, another round thing.
okay, one of the caps turns it on, the other shuts it down.
which one's which?
i don't know.
what... ?
when in doubt, pull the yellow wire.
how the hell do you feel yellow?
no excuses, just do it!
nice to be here.
that feeling won't last long.
