my parents won't be back till ten.
are you sure?
we're all alone, aren't we?
michael's around someplace...
i gotta go.
will you call me tomorrow?
yeah, sure.
promise?
yeah.
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. that should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
what did you use before?
thorazin.
he'll barely be able to sit up.
that's the idea. here we are.
the driveway's a few hundred yards up on your right.
are there any special instructions?
just try to understand what we're dealing with here. don't underestimate it.
i think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
if you say so.
your compassion is overwhelming, doctor.
ever done anything like this before?
only minimum security.
i see.
what does that mean?
it means... i see.
you don't have to make this harder than it already is.
i couldn't if i tried.
the only thin that ever bothers me is their jibberish. when they start raving on and on...
you don't have anything to worry about. he hasn't spoken a word in 15 years.
pull up to the entrance!
shouldn't we pick him up?
move it!
what did he say?
he asked me if i could help him find his purple lawnmower.
i don't think this is any time to be funny...
he said something else. "it's all right now. he's gone. the evil's gone."
hey, laurie...
hi, tommy.
are you coming over tonight?
same time, same place.
can we make jack-o-lanterns?
sure.
can we watch the monster movies?
sure.
will you read to me? can we make popcorn?
sure. sure.
yes, i am.
uh-uh. that's a spook house.
just watch.
lonnie elam said never to go up there. lonnie elam said that's a haunted house. he said real awful stuff happened there once.
lonnie elam probably won't get out of the sixth grade.
i gotta go. i'll see you tonight.
see you.
i'm not responsible, sam.
of course not.
i've given them his profile.
you must have told them we shocked him into a grinning idiot. two roadblocks and an all-points bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old!
he was your patient, doctor. if the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
i notified everybody! nobody listened.
there's nothing else i can do.
you can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. and tell them where he's going.
probably going.
i'm wasting time.
sam, haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. how could he get there? he can't drive.
he was doing all right last night. maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
it's totally insane! we have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game in the afternoon, i get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight. i'll be totally wiped out!
i think you have too much to do tomorrow.
totally!
as usual, i don't have anything to do.
it's your own fault and i don't feel sorry for you.
why didn't you wait for me?
we did. fifteen minutes. you totally never showed up.
that's not true. here i am.
what's wrong, annie? you're not smiling.
i'm never smiling again. paul dragged me into the boys' locker room to tell me...
exploring uncharted territory?
it's been totally charted.
we just talked.
sure.
old jerko got caught throwing eggs and soaping windows. his parents grounded him for the weekend. he can't come over tonight.
i thought you were babysitting tonight.
the only reason she babysits is to have a place to...
shit!
i have a place for that.
i forgot my chemistry book.
isn't that david graham? he's cute.
i don't think so...
annie, some day you're going to get us all in deep trouble.
totally.
well, are we still on for tonight?
i wouldn't want to get you in deep trouble, lynda.
come on, annie. bob and i have been planning on it all week.
all right. the wallaces leave at seven.
i'm baby sitting for the doyles. it's only three houses away. we can keep each other company.
terrific. i've got three choices. watch the kid sleep, listen to lynda screw, or talk to you.
what time?
i don't know yet. i have to get out of taking my stupid brother trick-or- treating.
saving the treats for bob?
fun-ny. see you.
look.
look where?
behind that bush there.
i don't see anything.
that man who drove by so fast, the one you yelled at.
subtle, isn't he? hey creep!
he was standing right here.
poor laurie. you scared another one away.
cute.
it's tragic. you never go out. you must have a small fortune stashed from babysitting so much.
the guys think i'm too smart.
well, home sweet home. i'll see you later.
okay. bye.
hello?
why did you hang up on me?
annie, was that you?
of course.
why didn't you say anything? you scared me to death.
i had my mouth full. couldn't you hear me?
i thought it was an obscene phone call.
now you hear obscene chewing. you're losing it, laurie.
i've already lost it.
i doubt that. listen, my mother is letting me use her car. i'll pick you up. 6:30.
sure, see you later.
bye.
you still spooked?
i wasn't spooked.
lies.
i saw someone standing in mr. riddle's back yard.
probably mister riddle.
he was watching me.
mister riddle was watching you? laurie, mister riddle is eighty-seven.
he can still watch.
that's probably all he can do.
what's the pumpkin for?
i brought it for tommy. i figured making a jack-o-lantern would keep him occupied.
i always said you'd make a fabulous girl scout.
thanks.
for that matter, i might as well be a girl scout tonight. i plan on making popcorn and watching doctor dementia. six straight hours of horror movies. little lindsey wallace won't know what hit her.
hi, annie, laurie...
hi, dad. what happened?
what?
what happened?
someone broke into the hardware store. probably kids.
you blame everything on kids.
the only things missing were some halloween masks, rope, a set of knives. what does that sound like to you?
you're going to be late at the doyles, annie.
huh?
you're going to be late!
he shouts, too.
sheriff? i'm doctor sam loomis.
lee brackett.
i'd like to talk to you, if i could.
may be a few minutes. i gotta stick around here...
it's important.
ten minutes.
i'll be here.
anybody live here?
not since 1963, since it happened. every kid in haddonfield thinks this place is haunted.
they may be right.
come on... a skunk could have killed it...
could have...
a man wouldn't do that...
he isn't a man.
i suppose i do seem a bit sinister for a doctor.
looks like to me you're just plain scared.
i am.  i met him fifteen years ago. i was told there was nothing left, no conscience, no reason, no understanding, in even the most rudimentary sense, of life or death or right or wrong. i met this six- year-old boy with a blank, cold emotionless face and the blackest of eyes, the devil's eyes. i spent eight years trying to reach him and another seven trying to keep him locked away when i realized what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.
what do we do?
he was here, earlier tonight, and he may be coming back. i'm going to wait for him.
i keep thinking i should call the radio and tv stations...
if you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
i'll check back in an hour.
..."how now, cried arthur. 'then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'that is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
i don't like that story.
but king arthur was always your favorite.
not any more.
why are they under there?
mom doesn't like me to have them.
'neutron man'... 'laser man'... i can see why. 'tarantula man'...
laurie, what's the boogey man?
get him out of here!
here, lester.
i hate that dog. i'm the only person in the world he doesn't like.
what's this big, big news?
what would you say if i told you that you were going to the homecoming dance tomorrow night?
i'd say you must have the wrong number.
well, i just talked with ben tramer and he got real excited when i told him how attracted you were to him.
annie, you didn't. tell me you didn't.
you guys will make a fabulous couple.
laurie...
i'm so embarrassed. i couldn't face him...
you'll have to. he's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
annie!
lindsey, lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
no, he's not.
what about the jack-o-lantern?
after the movie.
what about the rest of my comic books?
after the jack-o-lantern.
what about the bogyman?
there is no such thing.
richie said he was coming after me tonight.
do you believe everything that richie tells you?
no...
tommy, halloween night is when you play tricks on people and scare them. it's all make believe.
i saw the bogyman. i saw him outside.
there was no one outside.
there was.
what did he look like?
the bogyman!
we're no getting anywhere. all right, look, tommy. the bogyman can only come out on halloween night, right?
right.
and i'm here tonight and i won't let him get to you.
promise?
i promise.
can we make the jack-o-lantern now?
hello.
hi, lindsey, this is paul. is annie there?
yes, she is.
will you get her for me?
she's washing her clothes.
well, go tell her it's me, okay?
okay.
annie, paul's on the phone!
lindsey, open the door! i'm locked in the laundry room!
you locked yourself in.
i know. pull my legs. i'm stuck.
i'm scared.
then why are you sitting here with half the lights off?
i don't know.
well, come on, get your coat. we're going to pick up paul.
i don't want to.
look, lindsey, i thought we understood each other...
i want to stay here and watch this.
yes.
come with me.
fancy.
this has not been my night. my clothes are in the wash, i spilled butter down the front of me, i got stuck in a window...
i'm glad you're here because i have something i want you to do. i want you to call up ben tramer and tell him you were just fooling around.
i can't.
yes, you can.
he went out drinking beer with mike godfrey and he won't be back until late. you'll have to call him tomorrow. besides, i'm on my way to pick up paul.
wait a minute here...
if you watch her, i'll consider talking to ben tramer in the morning.
deal. hey, i thought paul was grounded.
he was. old jerko found a way to sneak out. listen, i'll call you in an hour or so.
tommy, stop it! you're scaring lindsey.
i saw him...
i said, stop it! there is no bogyman. there's nothing out there. if you don't stop all this, i'm turning off the tv and you go to bed.
jesus!
you all right?
sure...
nothing's going on. just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... i have the feeling you're way off on this...
you have the wrong feeling.
you're not coming up with much to prove me wrong.
exactly what do you need?
well, it's going to take more than fancy talk to keep me up all night creeping around these bushes.
i watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing this night. he's waited for it, inhumanly patient. hour after hour, day after day, waiting for some silent, invisible alarm to trigger him. death has arrived in your little town, sheriff. you can ignore it, or you can help me stop it.
more fancy talk... you want to know what haddonfield is? families. children, all lined up in rows, up and down these streets. you're telling me they're lined up for a slaughterhouse.
they could be.
i'll stay out with you tonight, doctor, just on the chance that you're right. and if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
now... first we'll talk a little, then annie will distract lindsey and we sneak quietly up the stairs to the first bedroom on the left. got it?
okay. first i rip your clothes off...
you idiot!
...then you rip my clothes off. then we rip lyndsey's clothes off. i think i've got it.
totally...
i wonder where they went.
annie probably took lindsey out or something. let's look for a note.
everybody has a good time tonight. okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
let's make more popcorn.
you've had enough. why don't we just sit down and watch the rest of this movie.
hi, laurie, what's up?
nothing. i was just sitting down for the first time tonight.
is annie around?
no. i thought she'd be home by now. she went to pick up paul.
well, she's totally not here.
they probably stopped off somewhere. have her call me when she gets back. i've got lyndsey here and i want to know what time to put her to bed.
okay. later.
have a good time.
i can't help it. it just keeps ringing.
and i can't keep you interested?
that's great. now you'll be too drunk to...
just answer the damn phone.
i can't. what if it's the wallaces!? we'd get annie in trouble.
fantastic. totally.
yeah.
want a beer?
yeah.
is that all you say?
yeah.
go get me a beer.
i thought you were gonna get one for me.
yeah?
who is it?
tommy, let me in!
tommy, i want you to go back upstairs...
what is it, laurie?
be quiet! get lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
i'm scared...
do what i say! now!
it's the bogyman, isn't it?
hurry!
where were you? i went back to the myers house...
i found the car! he's here!
where?
three blocks down. get in the car and go up that other street and then back down here. i'm going up the block.
now i want you to change your clothes, tommy. we're going to take a walk outside.
was it the bogyman?
i'm scared!
there's nothing to be scared of now. get changed.
are you sure?
yes.
how?
i killed him...
but you can't kill the bogyman.
now, i want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
you're coming with us...
listen to me. i want you to walk down the street to the mackensie's and knock on their door. you tell them to call the police and send them over here. do you understand?
laurie, you come with us...
no! do as i say.
