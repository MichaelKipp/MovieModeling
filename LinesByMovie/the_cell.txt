you liked him?
he is beautiful...
what now?
's broken.
who says?
mocky-lock.
oh no... no you don't.
"mocky-lock is the bogeyman.  mocky-lock wants me where i am."
i bet we can fix it.
sing a song of sixpence...
a pocketful of rye...
four-and-twenty blackbirds.
did we go sailing?
almost.  mocky-lock showed up.
"mocky-lock is the bogeyman, mocky-lock wants me where i am."
mocky-lock is a pain in the ass.
he hates me.
lucien baines?
she adores you.
she thinks i can bring edward back.
someday you can.  we all believe that...
we have been over this a dozen times.  no.
why not?  just once.  a trial run.  what harm could it do?
i do not want to find out.
miriam...
shush.
he creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
I have heard this argument before.  it is not happening.
it could take years for me to get past the barriers he is created.
if we reverse the feed and bring edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him.  imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
i do it all the time!
yes, but, you are a willing participant. picture edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
I would be there for him.
and he might blame you for terrifying him.  that one moment could erase all you have accomplished.  and if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
okay, okay...
you are sure?  any more nightmares?
no.
good.  we need you healthy and relaxed. you are going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
yes mother.
i do not want you up all night reading edward's case file of the nine millionth time.  balance, dear girl, is the key. leave the work here.
do not bring it home in this.
okay.
henry wants me to try this vietnamese place he is wild about.  want to come?
I have got to feed my cat.  besides, i want to get to bed early.
that is my girl.
she the one from santa cruz?
just graduated law school.  single mom. had a two-year-old daughter.
someone looking after her little girl?
grandparents.  live over in davis.
how is she?
pregnant.  thanks for asking.
here he is.
damn, man, i give up.  your partner tells you his wife's going to have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!
so?
anne vicksey did not own a dog.
i need it.
now?
now.
the dog's an albino.  he would love an animal like that.
gentlemen, i believe an albino dog is rare indeed.
breeders typically destroy albino pups, so this animal is truly unique.
nicole labetzki.  victim seven. forensics found dog hair in her car, but they had a k-9 unit at the scene and never had it checked.
the phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  and we got the match.
it is his dog.
after three years she remembers what the guy drove?
she remembers because it was her "dream truck."  wanted one just like it.
we proceed assuming she is.
let's give old carl a call.  tell him he is got company.
no.  can you get a man close?
we will go back to his house, pete. there is still a lot to do.  analyze the videos, track sales of the bleach, go through his records.  maybe he owns property somewhere.
they are in that fucking thing for forty hours, gordon.  four-oh.  he got julia at seven-thirty last night.  you know what time it is now...?!
sing a song of sixpence.
a pocketful of fucking rye.  what is wrong?
nothing.
why did we stop?
when did he lapse into the coma?
sometime yesterday morning.
what about the legalities of this...?
stargher is in custody.  the functional equivalent of being under arrest. normally, we would mirandize him, and if he did not lawyer up, we would interrogate him. but because of his condition, he does not have the capacity to waive those rights.
what if he was not like this?  what if he was "normal?"  conscious.  how far would you go?
as far as i needed.
there is always a chance they will confess.
really?  i do not work with violent cases, i work with children.  but even a kid lies.  they love it when they get you to believe something that is not true.  do not you think stargher would do the same?
sometimes... once they have been caught they feel a need for disclosure.  they have so much they want to tell. but they have never had a sympathetic ear. they need someone to understand why.  stargher used to hide the bodies very carefully.  it was part of the ritual. some were not found for weeks and any physical evidence had been meticulously wiped clean.  but these last three... they were still in water - always in water - but  listen, he was not just careless.  it went beyond that...
okay.  let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... most likely, that part is dead.  schizophrenics with whalen's infraction sever all ties with the real world.  I am sorry, i really am.
you sure you want to go through with this?
what else do we do?!
i do not know, pete, but for god's sake... this is nuts.  do you really understand what they are going to do?
i do not have to.
why jeopardize what we have already done? we caught the sonofabitch.  carl stargher.  that is going to be like bundy, gacy, dahmer.  a case that makes careers.  but if we push our luck.  if this is all bullshit and we come out smelling like it.
tell you what.  if this thing burns us, i take that heat.  i give you permission to point your finger at me and say "it was all his idea."
that is not what I am talking about, pete. I am talking about waking up and realizing this girl's going to die.
should not we get a catheter in him?
they took care of that, thank you, henry.
i still do not understand why i can not do this... this is not some "troubled kid" you are dealing with.
i realize that...
how hard could it be...?
the first... what?  six or seven times i went in.   remember what happened?
disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
like a new year's day hangover.
he needs to be turned over.
this man is deeply disturbed, he...
you do not know the procedure.
i know him.
this is not your responsibility. remember that.  do not let them use guilt as a tool.  if you want to stop, say so.
I will be fine.
she said convincingly.
catherine?  I am about to start.  if you want me to wait, or...
no.  no.
not a gift.  a highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that is all.  a genetic fluke.
catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.  when we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers."  all they did was observe and report.  nothing more.  but catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening.  she understood. and the patient responded.  edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things.  he knew she cared.
intravenous administration complete.
initiating connection.
that is why we monitor the use of the drugs so closely.  we do not want her getting to that degree of perceptual disorientation.
pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please henry.
is it cold in here?
what happened?
catherine!
I will get her...
edward baines, i presume.  hi, ed.  I am pete.
do you think that is funny?
no.  not at all.  from what i understand, he knows i"m here, is not that right?
i read about a woman in texas who was in a coma for seven years.  every time her husband came to visit, her heart would beat faster.  is not that something?  i do not know what name scientists have for something like that...
it does not have much to do with science.
what then?
the soul.  the spirit.  whatever you want to call it.
ah, the part of us that can not be explained.
agent novak?
peter, okay?
do you feel there is a side of yourself you do not show people?
absolutely.  i suppose everyone does.
just like we all have fantasies, right? things only we know, that we do not share.
that is what therapists are for, right?
with stargher i saw things...
what did you see?
a kingdom.  his utopia. life without consequence or restriction. he is not even carl stargher anymore. he is this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... without fear.  a horrible primitive ugly thing.  i do not want to talk in here.
why did you bring him here?
you are the shrink, you tell me.
as soon as i met him, you knew I would say yes.  he makes julia real for me.
you thought stargher wanted to be caught.
i did, yeah.
you were right.  there is a part of him that knows the truth.  about what he did, about himself.
what about julia?
this is going to sound terrible, but... i do not think she matters anymore.  not to him.  he never finished her.  the others...he was able to make them his.
you think you can do this, do not you?
he might tell me about julia.  the part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse.  who wants to be redeemed.
this is stargher we are talking about?
not stargher, not really.  he is split himself right down the middle. good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. a monster.  and an innocent child.  if i could reach the boy.
whoa.  hold on.  are not they the same guy?
do not you feel there are different sides to every personality?  maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  we are all human.
it is hard for me to see stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
then what is he?
evil.
if you believe that.
maybe this is a big fucking waste of time.
what happened to charles gish?
what happened?
what difference does it make...?
tell me.
a child can experience abuse worse than charlie's.  and grow up to be someone who would never, ever hurt another living thing.
you are sure of that?
yes.  i am.
right here.
next time, tell me, okay?
but you looked so cute.  all sleepy...
i hate to admit it, but there is something perversely satisfying about this.
i think that is the whole point.
remember, julia hickson is priority number one.  nothing else matters.  find out where she is.
okay, okay...
when we got here, you just topped and pulled her out.
that was with edward.  she is accustomed to his world.  stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory.  she is "lost."  someone has to go in. remind her what is really happening.  and get her out.  until then, she is at his mercy.
into stargher.  inside...
yes.
i have done this, you know.  been inside.
no.
nervous?
absolutely.
i have to ask you some things... are you taking any prescription drugs?
prevacid.  for my stomach.
any psychiatric medication?
no.
what about narcotics?
no.
i know your partner's here, but it is very important that you are honest.
i am.  I am a pretty boring guy.
i doubt that.
wait...
like hell "wait."
he wants us to follow.  the little boy...
little boy?!  that is him!
he brought you to me, did not he?  if you want julia to live, trust me.  trust him.
where the hell are we?
carl, do you know?  like on a map...
come on!
i can not leave him!
is she alright?
yes.  but you are going to sit down right now.  i have to...
agent cole.
i need you to find something in the basement...
already there.
that hoist, with the winch...
jesus christ, man, you look like hell.
considering where I have been...
you are bettin' the farm on something you saw after they pumped you full of god knows-what kind of shit?
i saw her.  julia.  alive.  i saw everything.
you might have seen jimmy hoffa dancing with timothy leary.  i do not care.
...a pocketful of rye.
four and twenty blackbirds...
baked in a pie.
damn him.
what is wrong?
agent novak.  i did not get a chance to clear him.
she changed the codes.
what is wrong?
it would take hours to re-route the system, and even if i did, i shouldn't.
instead of going into his mind...
she is bringing stargher into hers.
lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near delano.  bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it is just sitting there.
delano?
yep.  and guess who they hired to seal up the place?
you are kidding me.
i never kid.  my wife hates it.  says I am too serious.
i refilled the zyprexa and atavan...
i do not need them anymore...
i know.
I will come by tomorrow after work.  with dinner.
thanks miriam.  say hi to henry and...
...give a kiss to edward.
give a kiss to edward.
agent novak.
dr. kent.
you are looking well.
thanks you.  six weeks off does a body good.  i heard she got the approval to try the reversal with edward.
that is a secret.
federal bureau of investigation, ma'am. we know all, see all...
how is the patient.
awaiting his arrival.
what about the cat?
completely unaware.
that went well.
give her a minute.  hello, valentine.
you sure about this?
absolutely.  abigail...
i heard julia and john got married.
yep.  eloped.
good for them.
well look at that.
i told you.  you have to be optimistic. believe in them...
so you say.
he is mine?
all yours.  my boss says it is one of the strangest requests the bureau's ever had.
he also says that until proven differently, julia hickson was found as a result of good old-fashioned detective work.
it does not matter...
i do not know.  i think it does.  you know, catherine... if you ever want to talk about it.  what happened to stargher.  that last time.
they are hungry.
i got it.
thank you.
no problem.
no.  thank you.
