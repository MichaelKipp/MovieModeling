rooaaaarr!!!
oh, how ya doin', rex?

i was close to being scared that time.
aach! -- oh, hi, bo.
i wanted to thank you, woody, for saving my flock.
oh, hey - it was nothing.
whadda ya say i get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, i...
well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  I am not worried.  you should not be worried.
of course woody am not worried! he is been andy's favorite since kindergarten!
c'mon, guys!  every christmas and birthday we go through this.
but what if andy gets another dinosaur?  a mean one?  i just do not think i can take that kind of rejection.
hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.  this is andy we are talking about.
it does not matter how much we are played with.  what matters is that we are here for andy when he needs us.  that is what we are made for. right? everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
pardon me.  i hate to break up the staff meeting, but they are here! birthday guests at three o'clock!
stay calm, everyone!!
oh, boy.  will ya take a look at all those presents?!
i can not see a thing!
they are getting bigger.
wait!  there is a nice little one over there!
if i send out the troops, will you all calm down?
yes!  yes!  we promise!
okay, save your batteries!
sargent.  establish a recon post downstairs.  code red.  you know what to do.
yes sir!
should not they be there by now? what is taking them so long?!
hey, these guys are professionals. they are the best.  c'mon, they are not lying down on the job.
come in, mother bird, this is alpha bravo.
this is it!  this is it!  quiet, quiet, quiet!
come in, mother bird. alright...andy's opening the first present now.
a lunchbox?!
a lunchbox...?!
okay, we are on the last present now...
last present!
it is a big one...it's a...it's a boardgame!  repeat!  battleship -- battleship, the boardgame!
hey, watch it!
sorry there, old spudhead.
mission accomplished.  well done, men.  pack it up, we are going home.
so did i tell ya?  huh?  nothing to worry about.
oh, no!
oh, ya big lizard!  now we will never know what it is!
no, no!  turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
eh, he is puttin' 'em in backwards!
plus is positive, minus is negative! oh, let me!
there.
juvenile intrusion!  repeat! resume your positions now!
andy's coming, everybody!  back to your places.  hurry!
where is my ear?  who is seen my ear? did you see my ear?
outta my way!  here i come, here i come --
come on down, guys.  it is time for games!  we have got prizes!
oh, yeah!
what the heck is up there?
woody?  who is up there with you?
woody, what are you doing under the bed?
uh-h-h-h...nothing!  uh, nothing. I am sure andy was just a little excited, that is all.  too much cake and ice cream, i suppose.  it is just a mistake.
well, that mistake is sitting in your spot, woody.
have you been replaced?
hello-o-o...
ho-yaaahh!!!
yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
i need to repair my turbo boosters. do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
well, let's see, we have got double a's --
watch yourself!!
yes.  they are andy's toys.
alright, everyone.  you are clear to come up.
oh, really?  I am from playskool.
and I am from mattel.  well, I am not actually  from mattel, I am actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. well, i do not really understand the financials, but...
you would think they have never seen a new toy before.
well sure, look at him.  he is got more gadgets on him then a swiss army knife.
it is not a laser!  it is a little lightbulb that blinks!
what is with him?
laser-envy.
all right, that is enough.  look, we are all very impressed with andy's new toy --
toy?
t-o-y.  toy.
excuse me, i think the word you are searching for is space ranger.
the word I am searching for i can not say because there is pre-school toys present.
gettin' kind of tense, are not you?
oh, uh, mr. lightyear?  now I am curious.  what does a space ranger actually do?
he is not a space ranger!  he does not fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
excuse me.
oh, impressive wingspan.  very good!
oh, what?!...what?!  these are plastic.  he can not fly!
they are a terillium-carbonic alloy and i can fly.
no, you can't.
yes, i can.
you can't!
can!
can't!  can't!  can't!
i tell you, i could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
okay then, mr. lightbeer!  prove it.
all right, then, i will.  stand back everyone!
why, thank you.  thank you all. thank you.
that was not flying!  that was falling with style!
heh, heh, heh!  golly bob howdy --
oh, shut up!  in a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  they will see... they will see. I am still andy's favorite toy.
uh, let what?  i do not -- uh, what do you mean?  who?
i know andy's excited about buzz, but you know, he will always have a special place for you.
yeah.  like the attic.  heh, heh...
alright!  that is it!
listen, lightsnack, you stay away from andy.  he is mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
what are you talking about?  where is that bonding strip?!
and another thing.  stop with this spaceman thing.  it is getting on my nerves.
are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with star command? woody oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
do not even think about it, cowboy!
oh, yeah, tough guy?!
you actually think you are the "buzz lightyear?" oh, all this time i thought it was an act!  hey, guys!  look!  it is the real buzz lightyear!
you are mocking me, are not you?
oh, no, no, no...  buzz, look!  an alien!
where?
yessss!  ah, ha, ha, ha...
uh-oh.
it is sid!
i thought he was at summer camp!
who is it this time?
i can not tell.  hey, where is lenny?
oh, no...it's a combat carl.
just stay where you are, corporal! do not move, carl.  you will blow up. i know you are tired!  i know your leg is cramping, but you can not move. do you hear me?
what is going on?
nothing that concerns you spacemen. just us toys.
I would better take a look anyway.
why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
that is why.  sid.
sure is a hairy fellah.
no!  no, that is scud, you idiot!
that is sid!
you mean that happy child?
that am not no happy child.
he tortures toys -- just for fun.
i could have stopped him.
buzz, i would love to see you try.  'course I would love to see you as a crater.
to infinity and beyond!
oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  what would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, pizza planet?
pizza planet?!  oh, cool!
can i bring some toys?
you can bring one toy...
just one?
buzz!!  oh, buzz, buzz lightyear!! buzz lightyear, thank goodness! we have got trouble!
trouble?!  where?!
down there.  just down there.  a helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, buzz!
then we have no time to lose!!
wait a minute.  you -- you do not think i meant to knock buzz out the window, do you potato head?
that is mr. potato head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
now, it was an accident!  guys, c'mon now, you...you got to believe me
we believe you, woody.  right, rex?
oh, i do not like confrontations.
let's string him up by his pull- string!
i got dibs on his hat!
mom!  do you know where buzz is?
no, i have not seen him.
andy!  I am heading out the door.
but mom, i can not find him!
well, honey, just grab some other toy!  now c'mon!
okay...
i could not find my buzz.  i know i left him right there.
honey, I am sure he is around. you will find him.
it is too short!  we need more monkeys!
there are not any more!  that is the whole barrel.
can i help pump the gas?
sure!  I will even let you drive.
yeah?!
yeah -- when you are sixteen.
yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, mom.
right?  buddy?
i just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
oh.  oh, that is good.
but we are not on my planet, are we?
no.
next stop...
pizza planet!  yeah!!!
according to my nava-computer, the --
shut up!  just shut up, you idiot!!
sheriff, this is no time to panic.
this is the perfect time to panic! I am lost, andy is gone, they are going to move from their house in two days and it is all your fault!!
my fault?!  if you had not pushed me out of the window in the first place --
oh, yeah?  well, if you had not shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
do not talk to me about importance. because of you the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
what?!!  what are you talking about?!
buzz!  buzz, come back!
go away.
now you are sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
uh-huh.  and when we get there, we will be able to find a way to transport you...home.
well, then let's climb abroad.
no, no, no, wait, buzz, buzz, let's get in the back.  no one will see us there.
negative.  there are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  we will be much safer in the cockpit.
ow!  watch where you are going!
sorry.
wait a minute!  no buzz!  this way! there is a special ship.  i just saw it!
you mean it has hyperdrive?
hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
c'mon, c'mon, that is it...
where is it?  i do not see the --
spaceship.
alright buzz, get ready...
this is ludicrous.

what is gotten into you, sheriff?  i was --
you are the one that decided to climb into this --
what?
did i get my package in the mail?
i dunno.
whaddaya mean, you do not know?
i do not know!
oh no, hannah!
what?
look!  janie!
hey!!
she is sick!
no she is not --
I will have to perform one of my...operations!
no-o-o... do not touch her!  no!
sid, give her back!  give her back now!  I am telling!
patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
mom!!  mom!!
she is lying!  whatever she says it is not true!
I have set my laser from stun to kill.
oh, great, great.  yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
mom, have you seen woody?
where was the last place you left him?
right here in the van.
oh, I am sure he is there.  you are just not looking hard enough.
he is not here, mom.  woody's gone.
huh?!  huh?!  i told you he was guilty.
who would have thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
i sure hope this is not permanent.
still no word from star command. we are not that far from the spaceport --
woody, we do not know what is out there!
I will tell you what is -- aaaah!
they are going to eat us, buzz!!  do something!  quick!
shield your eyes!
it is not working.  i recharged it before i left.  it should be good for hours --
oh, you idiot!  you are a toy!  use your karate chop action!
get away!  hoo-cha!  hoo-cha!
hey!!  hey!  how are you doing that? stop that!
back!  back, you savages!  back!
woody, stop it!!
sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
another stunt like that, cowboy -- you are going to get us killed.
do not tell me what to do!
shhh!
what happened to you?
one minute you are defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down darjeeling with marie antoinette and her little sisters.
i think you have had enough tea for today.  let's get you out of here, buzz.
do not you get it?!  you see the hat? i am mrs. nesbit!!
oh, I am a sham!!
sh-h-h-h-h!!  quiet, buzz.
look at me!  i can not even fly out of a window!
but -- the hat looked good.  tell me the hat looked good!  the apron is a bit much, it is not my color...
out the window...buzz, you are a genius!
come on, this way!
years of academy training...wasted!!
b-3.
miss.  g-6.
ohhh!  you sunk it!
heh-heh.
are you peeking?
oh, quit your whining and pay up.
no, no, not the ear.  gimme the nose.  c'mon!
how 'bout three out of five?
son of a building block, it is woody!
he is in the psycho's bedroom!
hi!
everyone, it is woody!
woody?!
we are going to get outta here, buzz -- buzz?
boy, am i glad to see you guys!
i knew you would come back, woody!
what are you doing over there?
it is a long story, bo.  I will explain later.  here, catch this!
i got it, woody!
he got it, woody!
good going, slink!  now, just, just tie it on to something!
wait!  wait!  i got a better idea! how about we don't?!
did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  have you forgotten what he did to buzz?  and now you want to let him back over here?
no, no, no!  you got it all wrong, potato head.  buzz is fine!  buzz is right here.  he is with me!
you are a liar!
no, I am not!  buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you are not dead.
ha ha.  that is very funny, buzz.  this is serious!!
hey, woody!?  where did ya go?
hi ya, fellas.  to infinity and beyond!
hey look!  it is buzz!
yeah, hey buzz.  let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  gimme five, man!
something is screwy here.
so, you see?  we are friends now, guys.  are not we, buzz?  you bet.  gimme a hug.
ha, ha, oh, i love you, too.
see?  it is buzz.  now give back the lights, potato head.
wait just a minute.  what are you trying to pull?!
nothing.
oh, that is disgusting.
murderer!
no!  no, no, no, no!
you murdering dog!
no, it is not what you think, i swear!
save it for the jury.  i hope sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
no!  no!  do not leave!  do not leave! you have got to help us, please!  you do not know what it is like over here!
come on.  let's get out of here.
not now, mom, I am busy!
sid!!!
i looked everywhere, honey, but all i could find was your hat.
but what if we leave them behind?
oh, do not worry, honey, I am sure we will find woody and buzz before we leave tomorrow.
aa-a-a-a-ah!
will you quit moving around?!
I am sorry.  it is just that i get so nervous before i travel.
how did i get stuck with you as a moving buddy?
oh, come on, buzz.  i...buzz, i can not do this without you.  i need your help.
i can not help.  i can not help anyone.
why, sure you can, buzz.  you can get me out of here and then I will get that rocket off you, and we will make a break for andy's house.
andy's house.  sid's house.  what is the difference.
oh, buzz, you have had a big fall. you must not be thinking clearly.
no, woody, for the first time i am thinking clearly.  you were right all along.  I am not a space ranger.  I am just a toy.  a stupid little insignificant toy.
whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  being a toy is a lot better than being a space ranger.
yeah, right.
no, it is.  look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it is not because you are a space ranger, pal, it is because you are a toy!  you are his toy.
but why would andy want me?
why would andy want you?!  look at you!  you are a buzz lightyear.  any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  you have got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a cool toy.
buzz!!  what are you doing?  i thought you were --
come on, sheriff.  there is a kid over in that house who needs us. now let's get you out of this thing.
yes sir!
woody!  it is the moving van.
we have got to get out of here...now.
shhhhhhh!
what?!
it is ok.  everything's under control.
reach for the sky!!
huh?
this town am not big enough for the two of us!
what?!
somebody is poisoned the water hole...
it is busted.
w-w-w-we?
that is right.  your toys.
nice work, fellahs.  good job. comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  that was a stroke of genius.
woody!
everybody say, "bye, house."
bye, house.
hold on, woody!
i can not do it!  take care of andy for me!
no-o-o-o-o-o-o!!
no wait!  you do not understand! buzz is out there!  we have got to help him!!
toss 'im overboard!
no, no, no, wait!
well, thanks for the ride.
look out!!
we are almost there.
rocky!  the ramp!
woody!  speed up!
speed up!
i can not hold on much longer!
slink!  hang on!
great!
woody!  the rocket!
the match!
woody?!  what are you doing?
hold still, buzz!
ha-ha!!
you did it!  next stop.  andy.
ahhh!! this is the part where we blow up!
not today!
hey, buzz!!  you are flying!!
this is not flying.  this is falling -- with style!
ha ha!!  to infinity and beyond!!
uh, buzz?!  we missed the truck!
we are not aiming for the truck!
hey!  wow!
what?  what is it?
woody!  buzz!
oh, great, you found them.  where were they?
here!  in the car!
see?  now, what did i tell you? right where you left them.
which one can i open first?
let's let molly open one.
whoooooah!  oh!  bo!  there is got to be a less painful way to get my attention.
merry christmas, sheriff.
say, is not that mistletoe?
mm-hmmmmm.
buzz.  buzz lightyear.  you are not worried, are you?
i can not quite make out --
me?  no, no, no, no...  are you?
now buzz, what could andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
