well, sure, we can leave it up.
yeah!

uh, hey sarge, have you seen slinky?
sir!  no sir!
okay, thank you.  at ease.
hey, slinky?
right here, woody!
i'm red this time.
no, slink --
oh...well alright, you can be red if you want.
not now, slink.  i've got some bad news.
bad news?!
sh-h-h-h-h!!
just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
got it.
rooaaaarr!!!
oh, how ya doin', rex?
were you scared?  tell me honestly.
i was close to being scared that time.
aach! -- oh, hi, bo.
i wanted to thank you, woody, for saving my flock.
oh, hey - it was nothing.
whadda ya say i get someone else to watch the sheep tonight?
heh, heh...oh yeah, uh, i...
well, obviously she wanted to have the party before the move.  i'm not worried.  you shouldn't be worried.
of course woody ain't worried! he's been andy's favorite since kindergarten!
c'mon, guys!  every christmas and birthday we go through this.
but what if andy gets another dinosaur?  a mean one?  i just don't think i can take that kind of rejection.
hey, listen, no one's getting replaced.  this is andy we're talking about.
it doesn't matter how much we're played with.  what matters is that we're here for andy when he needs us.  that's what we're made for. right? everyone is now looking down, sheepish.
pardon me.  i hate to break up the staff meeting, but they're here! birthday guests at three o'clock!
stay calm, everyone!!
oh, boy.  will ya take a look at all those presents?!
i can't see a thing!
they're getting bigger.
wait!  there's a nice little one over there!
if i send out the troops, will you all calm down?
yes!  yes!  we promise!
okay, save your batteries!
sargent.  establish a recon post downstairs.  code red.  you know what to do.
yes sir!
shouldn't they be there by now? what's taking them so long?!
hey, these guys are professionals. they're the best.  c'mon, they're not lying down on the job.
come in, mother bird, this is alpha bravo.
this is it!  this is it!  quiet, quiet, quiet!
come in, mother bird. alright...andy's opening the first present now.
a lunchbox?!
a lunchbox...?!
okay, we're on the last present now...
last present!
it's a big one...it's a...it's a boardgame!  repeat!  battleship -- battleship, the boardgame!
hey, watch it!
sorry there, old spudhead.
mission accomplished.  well done, men.  pack it up, we're going home.
so did i tell ya?  huh?  nothing to worry about.
oh, no!
oh, ya big lizard!  now we'll never know what it is!
no, no!  turn 'em around, turn 'em around!
eh, he's puttin' 'em in backwards!
plus is positive, minus is negative! oh, let me!
there.
juvenile intrusion!  repeat! resume your positions now!
andy's coming, everybody!  back to your places.  hurry!
where's my ear?  who's seen my ear? did you see my ear?
outta my way!  here i come, here i come --
come on down, guys.  it's time for games!  we've got prizes!
oh, yeah!
what the heck is up there?
woody?  who's up there with you?
woody, what are you doing under the bed?
uh-h-h-h...nothing!  uh, nothing. i'm sure andy was just a little excited, that's all.  too much cake and ice cream, i suppose.  it's just a mistake.
well, that mistake is sitting in your spot, woody.
have you been replaced?
hello-o-o...
ho-yaaahh!!!
yes, it is a mistake, because, you see, the bed, here, is my spot.
i need to repair my turbo boosters. do you people still use fossil fuels, or have you discovered crystalic fusion?
well, let's see, we've got double a's --
watch yourself!!
yes.  they're andy's toys.
alright, everyone.  you're clear to come up.
oh, really?  i'm from playskool.
and i'm from mattel.  well, i'm not actually  from mattel, i'm actually from a smaller company that was purchased in a leveraged buy-out. well, i don't really understand the financials, but...
you'd think they've never seen a new toy before.
well sure, look at him.  he's got more gadgets on him then a swiss army knife.
it's not a laser!  it's a little lightbulb that blinks!
what's with him?
laser-envy.
all right, that's enough.  look, we're all very impressed with andy's new toy --
toy?
t-o-y.  toy.
excuse me, i think the word you're searching for is space ranger.
the word i'm searching for i can't say because there's pre-school toys present.
gettin' kind of tense, aren't you?
oh, uh, mr. lightyear?  now i'm curious.  what does a space ranger actually do?
he's not a space ranger!  he doesn't fight evil or shoot lasers or fly --
excuse me.
oh, impressive wingspan.  very good!
oh, what?!...what?!  these are plastic.  he can't fly!
they are a terillium-carbonic alloy and i can fly.
no, you can't.
yes, i can.
you can't!
can!
can't!  can't!  can't!
i tell you, i could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
okay then, mr. lightbeer!  prove it.
all right, then, i will.  stand back everyone!
why, thank you.  thank you all. thank you.
that wasn't flying!  that was falling with style!
heh, heh, heh!  golly bob howdy --
oh, shut up!  in a couple of days, everything will be just the way it was.  they'll see... they'll see. i'm still andy's favorite toy.
uh, let what?  i don't -- uh, what do you mean?  who?
i know andy's excited about buzz, but you know, he'll always have a special place for you.
yeah.  like the attic.  heh, heh...
alright!  that's it!
listen, lightsnack, you stay away from andy.  he's mine, and no one is taking him away from me.
what are you talking about?  where's that bonding strip?!
and another thing.  stop with this spaceman thing.  it's getting on my nerves.
are you saying you want to lodge a complaint with star command? woody oh okay, so you want to do it the hard way, huh?
don't even think about it, cowboy!
oh, yeah, tough guy?!
you actually think you're the "buzz lightyear?" oh, all this time i thought it was an act!  hey, guys!  look!  it's the real buzz lightyear!
you're mocking me, aren't you?
oh, no, no, no...  buzz, look!  an alien!
where?
yessss!  ah, ha, ha, ha...
uh-oh.
it's sid!
i thought he was at summer camp!
who is it this time?
i can't tell.  hey, where's lenny?
oh, no...it's a combat carl.
just stay where you are, corporal! don't move, carl.  you'll blow up. i know you're tired!  i know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. do you hear me?
what's going on?
nothing that concerns you spacemen. just us toys.
i'd better take a look anyway.
why is that soldier strapped to an explosive device?
that's why.  sid.
sure is a hairy fellah.
no!  no, that's scud, you idiot!
that is sid!
you mean that happy child?
that ain't no happy child.
he tortures toys -- just for fun.
i could have stopped him.
buzz, i would love to see you try.  'course i'd love to see you as a crater.
to infinity and beyond!
oh, all this packing makes me hungry.  what would you say to dinner at, uh, oh, pizza planet?
pizza planet?!  oh, cool!
can i bring some toys?
you can bring one toy...
just one?
buzz!!  oh, buzz, buzz lightyear!! buzz lightyear, thank goodness! we've got trouble!
trouble?!  where?!
down there.  just down there.  a helpless toy...it's...it's trapped, buzz!
then we've no time to lose!!
wait a minute.  you -- you don't think i meant to knock buzz out the window, do you potato head?
that's mr. potato head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
now, it was an accident!  guys, c'mon now, you...you gotta believe me
we believe you, woody.  right, rex?
oh, i don't like confrontations.
let's string him up by his pull- string!
i got dibs on his hat!
mom!  do you know where buzz is?
no, i haven't seen him.
andy!  i'm heading out the door.
but mom, i can't find him!
well, honey, just grab some other toy!  now c'mon!
okay...
i couldn't find my buzz.  i know i left him right there.
honey, i'm sure he's around. you'll find him.
it's too short!  we need more monkeys!
there aren't any more!  that's the whole barrel.
can i help pump the gas?
sure!  i'll even let you drive.
yeah?!
yeah -- when you're sixteen.
yuk, yuk, yuk -- funny, mom.
right?  buddy?
i just want you to know that even though you tried to terminate me, revenge is not an idea we promote on my planet.
oh.  oh, that's good.
but we're not on my planet, are we?
no.
next stop...
pizza planet!  yeah!!!
according to my nava-computer, the --
shut up!  just shut up, you idiot!!
sheriff, this is no time to panic.
this is the perfect time to panic! i'm lost, andy is gone, they're going to move from their house in two days and it's all your fault!!
my fault?!  if you hadn't pushed me out of the window in the first place --
oh, yeah?  well, if you hadn't shown up in your stupid little cardboard spaceship and taken away everything that was important to me --
don't talk to me about importance. because of you the security of this entire universe is in jeopardy.
what?!!  what are you talking about?!
buzz!  buzz, come back!
go away.
now you're sure this spacefreighter will return to its port of origin once it jettisons its food supply?
uh-huh.  and when we get there, we'll be able to find a way to transport you...home.
well, then let's climb abroad.
no, no, no, wait, buzz, buzz, let's get in the back.  no one will see us there.
negative.  there are no restraining harnesses in the cargo area.  we'll be much safer in the cockpit.
ow!  watch where you're going!
sorry.
wait a minute!  no buzz!  this way! there's a special ship.  i just saw it!
you mean it has hyperdrive?
hyper-active hyperdrive, and astro...uh, turf.
c'mon, c'mon, that's it...
where is it?  i don't see the --
spaceship.
alright buzz, get ready...
this is ludicrous.

what's gotten into you, sheriff?  i was --
you are the one that decided to climb into this --
what?
did i get my package in the mail?
i dunno.
whaddaya mean, you don't know?
i don't know!
oh no, hannah!
what?
look!  janie!
hey!!
she's sick!
no she's not --
i'll have to perform one of my...operations!
no-o-o... don't touch her!  no!
sid, give her back!  give her back now!  i'm telling!
patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
mom!!  mom!!
she's lying!  whatever she says it's not true!
i've set my laser from stun to kill.
oh, great, great.  yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
mom, have you seen woody?
where was the last place you left him?
right here in the van.
oh, i'm sure he's there.  you're just not looking hard enough.
he's not here, mom.  woody's gone.
huh?!  huh?!  i told you he was guilty.
who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
i sure hope this isn't permanent.
still no word from star command. we're not that far from the spaceport --
woody, we don't know what's out there!
i'll tell you what's -- aaaah!
they're gonna eat us, buzz!!  do something!  quick!
shield your eyes!
it's not working.  i recharged it before i left.  it should be good for hours --
oh, you idiot!  you're a toy!  use your karate chop action!
get away!  hoo-cha!  hoo-cha!
hey!!  hey!  how are you doing that? stop that!
back!  back, you savages!  back!
woody, stop it!!
sorry guys, but dinner's canceled!
another stunt like that, cowboy -- you're going to get us killed.
don't tell me what to do!
shhh!
what happened to you?
one minute you're defending the whole galaxy...  ...and suddenly you find yourself suckin' down darjeeling with marie antoinette and her little sisters.
i think you've had enough tea for today.  let's get you out of here, buzz.
don't you get it?!  you see the hat? i am mrs. nesbit!!
oh, i'm a sham!!
sh-h-h-h-h!!  quiet, buzz.
look at me!  i can't even fly out of a window!
but -- the hat looked good.  tell me the hat looked good!  the apron is a bit much, it's not my color...
out the window...buzz, you're a genius!
come on, this way!
years of academy training...wasted!!
b-3.
miss.  g-6.
ohhh!  you sunk it!
heh-heh.
are you peeking?
oh, quit your whining and pay up.
no, no, not the ear.  gimme the nose.  c'mon!
how 'bout three out of five?
son of a building block, it's woody!
he's in the psycho's bedroom!
hi!
everyone, it's woody!
woody?!
we're gonna get outta here, buzz -- buzz?
boy, am i glad to see you guys!
i knew you'd come back, woody!
what are you doing over there?
it's a long story, bo.  i'll explain later.  here, catch this!
i got it, woody!
he got it, woody!
good going, slink!  now, just, just tie it on to something!
wait!  wait!  i got a better idea! how about we don't?!
did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  have you forgotten what he did to buzz?  and now you want to let him back over here?
no, no, no!  you got it all wrong, potato head.  buzz is fine!  buzz is right here.  he's with me!
you are a liar!
no, i'm not!  buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
ha ha.  that's very funny, buzz.  this is serious!!
hey, woody!?  where'd ya go?
hi ya, fellas.  to infinity and beyond!
hey look!  it's buzz!
yeah, hey buzz.  let's show the guys our new secret best-friends hand shake.  gimme five, man!
something's screwy here.
so, you see?  we're friends now, guys.  aren't we, buzz?  you bet.  gimme a hug.
ha, ha, oh, i love you, too.
see?  it is buzz.  now give back the lights, potato head.
wait just a minute.  what are you trying to pull?!
nothing.
oh, that is disgusting.
murderer!
no!  no, no, no, no!
you murdering dog!
no, it's not what you think, i swear!
save it for the jury.  i hope sid pulls your voice-box out, ya creep!
no!  no!  don't leave!  don't leave! you've gotta help us, please!  you don't know what it's like over here!
come on.  let's get out of here.
not now, mom, i'm busy!
sid!!!
i looked everywhere, honey, but all i could find was your hat.
but what if we leave them behind?
oh, don't worry, honey, i'm sure we'll find woody and buzz before we leave tomorrow.
aa-a-a-a-ah!
will you quit moving around?!
i'm sorry.  it's just that i get so nervous before i travel.
how did i get stuck with you as a moving buddy?
oh, come on, buzz.  i...buzz, i can't do this without you.  i need your help.
i can't help.  i can't help anyone.
why, sure you can, buzz.  you can get me out of here and then i'll get that rocket off you, and we'll make a break for andy's house.
andy's house.  sid's house.  what's the difference.
oh, buzz, you've had a big fall. you must not be thinking clearly.
no, woody, for the first time i am thinking clearly.  you were right all along.  i'm not a space ranger.  i'm just a toy.  a stupid little insignificant toy.
whoa, hey -- wait a minute.  being a toy is a lot better than being a space ranger.
yeah, right.
no, it is.  look, over in that house is a kid who thinks you are the greatest, and it's not because you're a space ranger, pal, it's because you're a toy!  you are his toy.
but why would andy want me?
why would andy want you?!  look at you!  you're a buzz lightyear.  any other toy would give up his moving parts just to be you.  you've got wings, you glow in the dark, you talk, your helmet does that -- that whoosh thing -- you are a cool toy.
buzz!!  what are you doing?  i thought you were --
come on, sheriff.  there's a kid over in that house who needs us. now let's get you out of this thing.
yes sir!
woody!  it's the moving van.
we've got to get out of here...now.
shhhhhhh!
what?!
it's ok.  everything's under control.
reach for the sky!!
huh?
this town ain't big enough for the two of us!
what?!
somebody's poisoned the water hole...
it's busted.
w-w-w-we?
that's right.  your toys.
nice work, fellahs.  good job. comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  that was a stroke of genius.
woody!
everybody say, "bye, house."
bye, house.
hold on, woody!
i can't do it!  take care of andy for me!
no-o-o-o-o-o-o!!
no wait!  you don't understand! buzz is out there!  we've gotta help him!!
toss 'im overboard!
no, no, no, wait!
well, thanks for the ride.
look out!!
we're almost there.
rocky!  the ramp!
woody!  speed up!
speed up!
i can't hold on much longer!
slink!  hang on!
great!
woody!  the rocket!
the match!
woody?!  what are you doing?
hold still, buzz!
ha-ha!!
you did it!  next stop.  andy.
ahhh!! this is the part where we blow up!
not today!
hey, buzz!!  you're flying!!
this isn't flying.  this is falling -- with style!
ha ha!!  to infinity and beyond!!
uh, buzz?!  we missed the truck!
we're not aiming for the truck!
hey!  wow!
what?  what is it?
woody!  buzz!
oh, great, you found them.  where were they?
here!  in the car!
see?  now, what did i tell you? right where you left them.
which one can i open first?
let's let molly open one.
whoooooah!  oh!  bo!  there's gotta be a less painful way to get my attention.
merry christmas, sheriff.
say, isn't that mistletoe?
mm-hmmmmm.
buzz.  buzz lightyear.  you are not worried, are you?
i can't quite make out --
me?  no, no, no, no...  are you?
now buzz, what could andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
