lord walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the english art world.  has a couple of doctorates no less.
great news.
so ... i'm wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.
love to, sir, but no can do.  no spare room.  period.
david?
oh, look, i mean, it's kind of the last thing... i mean, i'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so i couldn't really er ...
i thought perhaps as vice-president, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the massive financial loss ...
on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs ... yes.  great news.  fabulous.  triumphant.  course it might need a little smoothing over.  when's he due?
tomorrow.  you have a problem with that?
no. perfect.  looking forward to it. cut to:
ahm, well, you know ~ that's a tough question - on one' level i think it ....
don't ask him about work, charlie. life's too short.
jennifer can stay and look after kevin
sounds great.  excellent.  though-, ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the gallery, from england...
yeeees?
and they asked me if we'd like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
there aren't hotels?
yes, there are hotels.  they just thought maybe it'd be nice for him to stay with a real american family.  popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
and what did you say?
i said i'd check with you.
do we know anything about him?
ahm - he's male.  he's english.  he's a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  i think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  i think we're looking at someone moderately normal here.
david - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
yes.  yes.  sometime.
it's the last thing we need.
that's exactly what i said ... before i said - great, it's a sensational idea."
hiya dad ~ i'll need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh, 20 minutes.
great, good.
oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.  all englishmen are ugly.
what makes you say that?
all the guys they claim are english to and good-looking like dan day- lewis and liam neeson, turn out to be irish.  even anthony hopkins is welsh.  prince charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
richard burton was very good-looking.
welsh.
sean connery.
scottish.
tom jones?
welsh again.
okay, so the guy's gonna look like meatloaf's backside.  no-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived.
well, michael bolton's pretty grisly.
i vote for bart.
shut up, kevin.
no, seriously - i know he's your boyfriend, but there's something about his upper lip that is so weird.  what do you think it is, dad?  jen says it's a moustache, i say it's a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
you know the thing i hate most about children?
nope.
you.
well, they're kind of busy but it doesn't look like ...
did you really ask?
i'm not sure i got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
what's wrong with you, david?  all you have to do is say, excuse me, i've been sitting here since the start of the millennium and i'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. i'll go.
it isn't working any more, david.
i know - i'11 take it in to george tomorrow'- he'll fix it.  stupid thing.
jesus.
i need some time, david.  a little time.  it's not just you.  it's partly me.
go ahead.
i had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
there were three strawberries.
one.
liar.
0h ali we can work this thing out, you know.
ali?  what's wrong?
your face smells like a foot.
honey, calm down now... it's okay...
there's a man.  i woke up next to a man ...
shut up, kevin.  honey, you-re not making sense ...
it's okay.  there's no one out here. just open the door.  trust me.
okay.  it's not a problem... let's just sit ... i'11 talk to the gallery ...
david, i'm serious!
i know you are.  very serious ... most of the time these days.
now what does that mean?  my daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and i'm supposed to think it's amusing?  that tie's god-awful.  why do you wear it?
ah, mr bean ...
excuse me.
two dollars please.
annie, it's me.
oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
no, annie, no.  this is doctor bean. he's going to be working with us.
he doesn't like to say much does he?
right first time.
i can understand that. neither do i.
excuse me.  mr grierson called down. he's ready to see you upstairs.
thanks, annie.
better go.  grierson hates people being late.
yes.  ahm... think i'11 ...
ah, david.  finally.  and this must be our professor from across the sea.
yes, this is doctor bean.
it's very good bernie.
but the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
ah... he certainly has something, sir.
very pleased you've taken him in, david.  at a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
yes, although, i really..... thank you.  yes, it's great to have him with us. the whole family's very excited.
glad to hear it.  tell poor mr larson to come through, will you?
you're not going to ....
sack him?  david, what else can i do?  this business is not, repeat, not breaking even. and david ... notice anything this morning?
goodnight annie.
night.
he was incredible.  this guy is fearless.  he has no fear.
that's one - way of looking at it.  you might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
well, there is that ...
i'11 give you a chance... know anything about computers?
hi,
hi.....  roses.
yes.  and	i have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
great.  you said you'd ask grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  did you?
sort of half.....
meaning?
i was sort of half way through the sentence in which i would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
honestly david, you're so spineless.
i wish i could use that at school.  "hey, teach, no hard feelings ... it's just things between us ain't what they used to be and i need a little space, ya know?  so i'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
it's a kind of an interesting swap. mom for the man from ga ga.
jen - you don't wanna talk about it?
it's you and mom that need to talk.
sure.  you're right.
you know, mr. bean's okay.  you're not gonna kick him out, are you, dad?
of course he is.
are you?
as you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  nobody gets past elmer here.  isn't that right?
not in one piece anyway.  i see mrs whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  i'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  the vice president here will vouch for that.
you've known me five years elmer. when do you get to calling me david?
not my place, sir.  it would only be a matter of time before i'm calling you dave.  then where would we be?  by next year, you're my sweety-pie" and i'm "coochie-coo".  i'11 be back in 15.
i was hoping du.  bean might take a look at my computer project today.
yes.  i'11 mention it to him.  but ... he's kind of his own guy, you know?
howls he getting on with the family?
ah. fine.  it's good.  it's great.
and howls alison?
she's ... well, she's good.
saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  nice guy.  good looking.
yes, isn't he.
it's great when people who work together can become real friends.
isn't it?
look, i've left bean on his own. nice to chat though bernie - always a subtle joy.
thanks, david.  always a pleasure.
'emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
not necessarily.  that's where this ...  comes in.  no, i've had a better idea than sacking people.  you'll hear soon enough.
seems to be a problem with the door. where's the picture gone?
ahm.....
what?  what?
oh jesus.  oh god.  oh jesus god.  oh mary mother of jesus. oh jesus of nazareth.
oh dear.
what happened?!!!
ahm.... .
no!
er ... pray tell me why?
the thing is, sir, i've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of dr bean here - and we feel the time's come for whistler's mum to have her first face-lift.
time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
exactly.  she's in a surprisingly terrible state.  isn't she, bean?
oh yes.
whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
thank you david.  however, flattery will get you nowhere.  truth is, i have a rather different plan for whistler's dear mama.  bernie and i have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...
... you have to sack me.  i understand, sir.  i'll go quietly.  in fact i'll go right now.
no. no, no, hold on ... we cant sustain our loses - so i've decided.. to sell whistler's mother.
brilliant, huh?  i already have a prospective buyer - the current governor of california, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  spread the news.  i think decisive leadership has done the trick, don't you?
yes, sir.  yes, sir.  congratulations. marvellous thing.  bravo.
it wasn't a dream, was it.  i have to go in to work and tell them whistler's mother now looks like danny de vito.
well, ahm....
i think you're wrong, david.  she looks as fine as she's ever looked. worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
ahm....
bravo.  let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  don't want anything to go wrong.
quite right, sir.
bye, dad.
ah ... jennifer, i need you to watch kevin.  jen?
hey, en, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are gonna look just like its handsome driver.
jennifer!  this is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. i've told you never to get on one of those death traps!  please - talk to me.  i promise to be reasonable.
come on sting!
sting?!  sounds like something you put on a rash.
big day today, huh? 78
uh ... yes ...
great day.  at last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
yes, look, i wanted to talk to you about this.  i'm sure we haven't been doing as badly as all that.
you're an innocent and an optimist david - that's why i love you. .  jesus - what a terrible tie- come on, the governor's coming at 3. and before then i have a little surprise for you and the boss.
well, congratulations.  isn't that great, david?
certainly is.
we'll be able to start this afternoon.  i'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  now, that'll impress the governor.
well, bravo!  what with you and whistler's ma - i think i've got a winning team.
you arrange those flowers yourself?
sure did.
they're pretty.  learn it in the army?
no - but when you've torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.
what a pleasure, governor reynolds.  i'd like you to meet some of our staff here. .
and that's where you introduce me to the governor.
right.  got it.
this is elmer, our longest serving...
hey.  let's junk the medals, elmer.  this is not a veterans' reunion. we wanna make the governor feel at home.  not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.
okay, that'll do.  the governor's here in half an hour.  we have to be totally ready then.  no excuses.  period!
thank you bernie.  well done.  now, if you'll excuse - i have a little smartening up to do myself.
what a pleasure, governor.  welcome.
hi, grierson, forgive the war paint.  going on to my regiment/s reunion after.
not at all, governor.  very striking.
interesting suit.
why thank you sir.
off the peg?
yes it is ... may i introduce you to bern ...
everything okay, david?
yes.  ahm.  i was just wondering where my english house guest had got to.
he's just parking the governor's car.
great - keep him out of trouble.
david.  there's a call for you.  it's your wife.
great.  classic timing.  why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  i'll check my diary later.
i've known soldiers who've had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two.  not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you didn't even know it'd been stolen!  i'd sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
i am sorry you feel that way.
and i'm sorry you look that way, short-ass.  that suit stinks and you obviously dye your hair.
is jenny gonna be okay?
she was wearing a helmet.  it could have been worse.
but is she gonna be okay?
how the hell should i know?
at least you didn't bring mr bean with you.
ah, well .... cut to:
doctor jacobson?
yes?
we need you urgently in c theatre.
damn.  i was just going to number 4 ....
it is urgent, sir.
okay.....
0 my god.
sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
nothing ever really changes, does it, david?
say that again, son.
i beg your pardon?
i said say that again, son - because the next time you do, i'll make sure you're in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she's in a coma with a broken arm right now.
i'm er ... sorry if you've been waiting a long time.
we have.  in fact, we've been sitting here since the start of the millennium and i'd really like some action from you before the end of the world.
so, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
okay, sir.  certainly.  good.
let's get a coffee.
yes.  great.  kevin, i'11 send bean in to keep you company.
everything's gonna be fine.
about charles...
shhh...
it was nothing.  we're not ... he just makes me laugh.  when was the last time we laughed?  any of us?
i know... i know. i've been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. olympic standard.
maybe i ought to think about getting another job.
good idea - with a boss who's a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
here, let me do that.
no, i'm fine.
he's not too bad.  i can live with him.
i'm afraid you don't know the half of it. sit down.  i have a tale to tell.  and not a happy one.
he's a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
thank you, sir.  although, i'm afraid i don't quite see how we can ...
good point bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive interjection i'd expect from my new v.p. how can we, you ask, survive without whistler's mother - our single greatest asset?  well, the truth is - we can't.  so what am i saying?  will we find her again?  never - this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius.
david, david, david ...
i'm fired?  because i let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
of course not.  i'm sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement.  a loss i trust bernie will be able to reverse.
look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all completely fictional ... back as far as june 93 ...
i don't think you really understand what you're looking at ...
i owe you a very serious apology, young man.  it wouldn't surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  i sincerely hope that you do not.
very accommodating well, no, sir, i'm sure ...
of course.
and a car.
mmmmm...
maybe two cars.
a car sounds sensible.
and i need fridays off, to spend more time with my family.  speaking of which - if you'll excuse me .... i've got a lot of time to make up.
... in the distant future.
bye, bean.  thanks for everything. and take care, huh?  i know it's insane, but i'm going to miss you.
