lord walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the english art world.  has a couple of doctorates no less.
great news.
so ... I am wondering if one of you would have this guy stay in your home instead of some expensive hotel.
love to, sir, but no can do.  no spare room.  period.
david?
oh, look, i mean, it is kind of the last thing... i mean, I would really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so i could not really er ...
i thought perhaps as vice-president, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the massive financial loss ...
on the other hand ... maybe a breath of fresh air is just what my family needs ... yes.  great news.  fabulous.  triumphant.  course it might need a little smoothing over.  when is he due?
tomorrow.  you have a problem with that?
no. perfect.  looking forward to it. cut to:
ahm, well, you know ~ that is a tough question - on one' level i think it ....
do not ask him about work, charlie. life's too short.
jennifer can stay and look after kevin
sounds great.  excellent.  though-, ahm... there is this guy who is coming to work at the gallery, from england...
yeeees?
and they asked me if we would like to ... you know... put him up for a while.
there are not hotels?
yes, there are hotels.  they just thought maybe it would be nice for him to stay with a real american family.  popcorn, waffles, all that stuff.
and what did you say?
i said I would check with you.
do we know anything about him?
ahm - he is male.  he is english.  he is a doctor of er ... at least 2 things.  i think they would have mentioned if he was a blind dwarf.  or one of those guys who kills lots of people all the time.  i think we are looking at someone moderately normal here.
david - are you ever going to learn to say 'no'?
yes.  yes.  sometime.
it is the last thing we need.
that is exactly what i said ... before i said - great, it is a sensational idea."
hiya dad ~ I will need you upstairs for homework in about ....  oh, 20 minutes.
great, good.
oh come on - the guy's going to be a creep.  all englishmen are ugly.
what makes you say that?
all the guys they claim are english to and good-looking like dan day- lewis and liam neeson, turn out to be irish.  even anthony hopkins is welsh.  prince charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
richard burton was very good-looking.
welsh.
sean connery.
scottish.
tom jones?
welsh again.
okay, so the guy's going to look like meatloaf's backside.  no-one's asking you to go to bed with him.
who do you think is the ugliest guy who ever lived.
well, michael bolton's pretty grisly.
i vote for bart.
shut up, kevin.
no, seriously - i know he is your boyfriend, but there is something about his upper lip that is so weird.  what do you think it is, dad?  jen says it is a moustache, i say it is a cluster of about 11 mosquitoes, resting.
you know the thing i hate most about children?
nope.
you.
well, they are kind of busy but it does not look like ...
did you really ask?
I am not sure i got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
what is wrong with you, david?  all you have to do is say, excuse me, I have been sitting here since the start of the millennium and I would really like some action from you before the end of the world. I will go.
it is not working any more, david.
i know - i'11 take it in to george tomorrow'- he will fix it.  stupid thing.
jesus.
i need some time, david.  a little time.  it is not just you.  it is partly me.
go ahead.
i had the last strawberry in the refrigerator.
there were three strawberries.
one.
liar.
0h ali we can work this thing out, you know.
ali?  what is wrong?
your face smells like a foot.
honey, calm down now... it is okay...
there is a man.  i woke up next to a man ...
shut up, kevin.  honey, you-re not making sense ...
it is okay.  there is no one out here. just open the door.  trust me.
okay.  it is not a problem... let's just sit ... i'11 talk to the gallery ...
david, I am serious!
i know you are.  very serious ... most of the time these days.
now what does that mean?  my daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I am supposed to think it is amusing?  that tie's god-awful.  why do you wear it?
ah, mr bean ...
excuse me.
two dollars please.
annie, it is me.
oh, right, yeah.  two dollars please.
no, annie, no.  this is doctor bean. he is going to be working with us.
he does not like to say much does he?
right first time.
i can understand that. neither do i.
excuse me.  mr grierson called down. he is ready to see you upstairs.
thanks, annie.
better go.  grierson hates people being late.
yes.  ahm... think i'11 ...
ah, david.  finally.  and this must be our professor from across the sea.
yes, this is doctor bean.
it is very good bernie.
but the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
ah... he certainly has something, sir.
very pleased you have taken him in, david.  at a time when no-one's job is safe, it really identifies you as a team player.
yes, although, i really..... thank you.  yes, it is great to have him with us. the whole family's very excited.
glad to hear it.  tell poor mr larson to come through, will you?
you are not going to ....
sack him?  david, what else can i do?  this business is not, repeat, not breaking even. and david ... notice anything this morning?
goodnight annie.
night.
he was incredible.  this guy is fearless.  he has no fear.
that is one - way of looking at it.  you might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
well, there is that ...
i'11 give you a chance... know anything about computers?
hi,
hi.....  roses.
yes.  and	i have a wine for dinner that will kill you.
great.  you said you would ask grierson about putting our guest somewhere else.  did you?
sort of half.....
meaning?
i was sort of half way through the sentence in which i would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.
honestly david, you are so spineless.
i wish i could use that at school.  "hey, teach, no hard feelings ... it is just things between us am not what they used to be and i need a little space, ya know?  so i'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
it is a kind of an interesting swap. mom for the man from ga ga.
jen - you do not wanna talk about it?
it is you and mom that need to talk.
sure.  you are right.
you know, mr. bean's okay.  you are not going to kick him out, are you, dad?
of course he is.
are you?
as you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  nobody gets past elmer here.  is not that right?
not in one piece anyway.  i see mrs whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I would kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  the vice president here will vouch for that.
you have known me five years elmer. when do you get to calling me david?
not my place, sir.  it would only be a matter of time before I am calling you dave.  then where would we be?  by next year, you are my sweety-pie" and I am "coochie-coo".  i'11 be back in 15.
i was hoping du.  bean might take a look at my computer project today.
yes.  i'11 mention it to him.  but ... he is kind of his own guy, you know?
howls he getting on with the family?
ah. fine.  it is good.  it is great.
and howls alison?
she is ... well, she is good.
saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  nice guy.  good looking.
yes, is not he.
it is great when people who work together can become real friends.
is not it?
look, I have left bean on his own. nice to chat though bernie - always a subtle joy.
thanks, david.  always a pleasure.
'emergency measures, in your book means sack people right?
not necessarily.  that is where this ...  comes in.  no, I have had a better idea than sacking people.  you will hear soon enough.
seems to be a problem with the door. where is the picture gone?
ahm.....
what?  what?
oh jesus.  oh god.  oh jesus god.  oh mary mother of jesus. oh jesus of nazareth.
oh dear.
what happened?!!!
ahm.... .
no!
er ... pray tell me why?
the thing is, sir, I have just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of dr bean here - and we feel the time's come for whistler's mum to have her first face-lift.
time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
exactly.  she is in a surprisingly terrible state.  is not she, bean?
oh yes.
whistler was a great painter, but he was not a great chooser of paints ....
thank you david.  however, flattery will get you nowhere.  truth is, i have a rather different plan for whistler's dear mama.  bernie and i have been inspecting our books - and the long and short of it is, we cannot survive with our current losses, so ...
... you have to sack me.  i understand, sir.  I will go quietly.  in fact I will go right now.
no. no, no, hold on ... we cant sustain our loses - so I have decided.. to sell whistler's mother.
brilliant, huh?  i already have a prospective buyer - the current governor of california, no less, who is flies in tomorrow to inspect her and clinch the deal.  spread the news.  i think decisive leadership has done the trick, do not you?
yes, sir.  yes, sir.  congratulations. marvellous thing.  bravo.
it was not a dream, was it.  i have to go in to work and tell them whistler's mother now looks like danny de vito.
well, ahm....
i think you are wrong, david.  she looks as fine as she is ever looked. worth every cent of the 10 million dollar-s.
ahm....
bravo.  let's put on a good show tomorrow, shall we?  do not want anything to go wrong.
quite right, sir.
bye, dad.
ah ... jennifer, i need you to watch kevin.  jen?
hey, en, nice bike'- but remember: any kids you have are going to look just like its handsome driver.
jennifer!  this is not - repeat, not! how we do things in this family. I have told you never to get on one of those death traps!  please - talk to me.  i promise to be reasonable.
come on sting!
sting?!  sounds like something you put on a rash.
big day today, huh? 78
uh ... yes ...
great day.  at last we can start getting out of debt and concentrating on the future.
yes, look, i wanted to talk to you about this.  I am sure we have not been doing as badly as all that.
you are an innocent and an optimist david - that is why i love you. .  jesus - what a terrible tie- come on, the governor's coming at 3. and before then i have a little surprise for you and the boss.
well, congratulations.  is not that great, david?
certainly is.
we will be able to start this afternoon.  i'11 pipe the guide to every video screen in the gallery.  now, that will impress the governor.
well, bravo!  what with you and whistler's ma - i think I have got a winning team.
you arrange those flowers yourself?
sure did.
they are pretty.  learn it in the army?
no - but when you have torn out a man's throat with your bare hands, you learn to appreciate the beautiful things in life.
what a pleasure, governor reynolds.  I would like you to meet some of our staff here. .
and that is where you introduce me to the governor.
right.  got it.
this is elmer, our longest serving...
hey.  let's junk the medals, elmer.  this is not a veterans' reunion. we wanna make the governor feel at home.  not remind him of piles of dead people wearing uniforms.
okay, that will do.  the governor's here in half an hour.  we have to be totally ready then.  no excuses.  period!
thank you bernie.  well done.  now, if you will excuse - i have a little smartening up to do myself.
what a pleasure, governor.  welcome.
hi, grierson, forgive the war paint.  going on to my regiment/s reunion after.
not at all, governor.  very striking.
interesting suit.
why thank you sir.
off the peg?
yes it is ... may i introduce you to bern ...
everything okay, david?
yes.  ahm.  i was just wondering where my english house guest had got to.
he is just parking the governor's car.
great - keep him out of trouble.
david.  there is a call for you.  it is your wife.
great.  classic timing.  why do not you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I will check my diary later.
I have known soldiers who have had their heads blown off who were more intelligent than you two.  not only have you failed to protect your most valuable possession from theft - but you did not even know it would been stolen!  I would sooner buy heroin from the guy who sells drugs outside my grandson's school than anything from you guys.
i am sorry you feel that way.
and I am sorry you look that way, short-ass.  that suit stinks and you obviously dye your hair.
is jenny gonna be okay?
she was wearing a helmet.  it could have been worse.
but is she gonna be okay?
how the hell should i know?
at least you did not bring mr bean with you.
ah, well .... cut to:
doctor jacobson?
yes?
we need you urgently in c theatre.
damn.  i was just going to number 4 ....
it is urgent, sir.
okay.....
0 my god.
sorry, honey - he just happened to tag along.
nothing ever really changes, does it, david?
say that again, son.
i beg your pardon?
i said say that again, son - because the next time you do, I will make sure you are in there with my daughter, but in a slightly less healthy state and she is in a coma with a broken arm right now.
I am er ... sorry if you have been waiting a long time.
we have.  in fact, we have been sitting here since the start of the millennium and I would really like some action from you before the end of the world.
so, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
okay, sir.  certainly.  good.
let's get a coffee.
yes.  great.  kevin, i'11 send bean in to keep you company.
everything's going to be fine.
about charles...
shhh...
it was nothing.  we are not ... he just makes me laugh.  when was the last time we laughed?  any of us?
i know... i know. I have been an arsehole of spectacular proportions. olympic standard.
maybe i ought to think about getting another job.
good idea - with a boss who is a really ugly son-of-a-bitch.
here, let me do that.
no, I am fine.
he is not too bad.  i can live with him.
I am afraid you do not know the half of it. sit down.  i have a tale to tell.  and not a happy one.
he is a man with a plan who will haul us into profitability and the 21st century.
thank you, sir.  although, I am afraid i do not quite see how we can ...
good point bernie - precisely the kind of perceptive interjection I would expect from my new v.p. how can we, you ask, survive without whistler's mother - our single greatest asset?  well, the truth is - we can't.  so what am i saying?  will we find her again?  never - this robber was clearly the work of a criminal of great genius.
david, david, david ...
I am fired?  because i let a... copy of a painting the get stolen?
of course not.  I am sacking you for neglectful conduct, relating to the heavy financial loss this gallery has incurred, through your recent lack of professional judgement.  a loss i trust bernie will be able to reverse.
look at all this - publicity expenditure ... catering ... all completely fictional ... back as far as june 93 ...
i do not think you really understand what you are looking at ...
i owe you a very serious apology, young man.  it would not surprise me if you wanted to leave us after this.  i sincerely hope that you do not.
very accommodating well, no, sir, I am sure ...
of course.
and a car.
mmmmm...
maybe two cars.
a car sounds sensible.
and i need fridays off, to spend more time with my family.  speaking of which - if you will excuse me .... I have got a lot of time to make up.
... in the distant future.
bye, bean.  thanks for everything. and take care, huh?  i know it is insane, but I am going to miss you.
