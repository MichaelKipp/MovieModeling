you work here?
yes, i do.
what do you do?
I am an evolutionary biologist.  what do you do?
nothing.  I am in third grade.  what is a revolutionary what ch'a ma' callit?
evolutionary biologist.  i study how life on earth evolved over millions of years.
way cool.  then you know where the dinosaurs are.
fourth floor, west wing, but stay with your class.
beauregard!  you scared me half to death.
I am sorry, sir.  you okay?
someone broke into this room.
anything missin'?
does not look like it.  we are damned lucky.  this statue is priceless.
looks like the curse is still at work.
the claws are sharp... i must have cut myself.  better move these crates to the secure storage area where they will be safe.
do not know if it will do any good, mr. cuthbert.
why not?
no one broke into this room, sir. someone broke out.  that lock was torn off from the inside.
if i spent half the time on my fractal evolution thesis that i spend on this fly rod, I would have my phd.
but at what a price.
i have the species identification on these teeth.  we can extract dna and start running tests on the extrapolator program.  call dr. frock.  he wanted a demonstration.
margo, you have not heard?
what?
frock's been fired.
that is impossible.
I am sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me.  telegraph. telephone.  tell kawakita.  i got the definitive word from cuthbert's secretary.  this is dr. frock's last week.
yes.  bit of a shock.  but as cuthbert so tactfully put it, the museum needs new blood.  and since I have been here since the mesozoic era --
i do not believe it.
now margo, do not overreact.  cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  my leaving makes perfect sense.  this is not exactly early retirement.  I have overstayed the party a bit.
we can not do without you.  you are one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  you are practically an institution around here.
that, apparently, is the problem. I am yesterday's news.  who needs a curator of plant biology in a museum with one exhibit on plants?  monsters and dinosaurs, cannibals and shamans are the new currency of the realm.
please.  do not humiliate me further.
let me help.  i can take care of everything.
no, margo.  this is one problem you can not solve.  you have to stay out of it.  the fact is, i want to retire.
how can you say that?  you know it is not true.
yes it is.  I am tired and I am no longer needed --
my work on fossil intermediates would be crippled without you.
with all due respect, dear, that is bull.  you dance rings around me with your new technology.  you have left me in the dust.
your work is highly relevant.  what about your display on primitive pharmacology?  cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the superstition exhibit.
healing plant use among the ki tribe of bechuanaland has been cancelled to make room for tibetan erotic art.
come on.  I will walk you back to the elevator.
I am not giving up.
you must.
this is not a death sentence.  greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I will garden.  I will write.
you are this museum.  it will not be the same without you.
everyone needs a change of scenery. I have been rolling down these halls for forty-odd years.  that is quite enough.
this room sucks.
she is never going to take us to see the dinosaurs.  that lady said they were on the fourth floor.
let's ditch and find them ourselves.
we are not supposed to go back there.
chicken.  this is a great short cut.
i do not want to go this way.
do not be a wuss.  come on.
quiet!
what is it?
i do not know.  but i think it is bad.
who are you?  the undertaker?
special agent pendergast.  fbi.
vince d'agosta.  am i out?
not at all.  i think we may be working on the same case.  if so, i could use your help.
the body?
what is left of it.
mind if i have a look?
we need light in here, stat.
where is the head?
careful.  that mess on the ground is brains.
whose footprints?
night watchman who found the body. sweet old man.  been tossing his cookies for over an hour.  not a likely suspect.
for once I am glad you are rumor central.  what in the world is going on?
someone is been murdered.  not shot, strangled or stabbed, either.  torn limb from limb.  there is talk of a psychotic killer or even an animal.
that cuthbert.  what a piece of work. someone is dead and all he cares about is his superstition exhibit.
cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  the museum is in debt.  contributions and public funding have dried up.  admissions no longer cover overhead.  the last big infusion of cash we had was the king tut exhibit.  cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  if the superstition exhibit is not lucrative, he will have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
mbwun.
what is that?
an original roger tory peterson of a red-breasted merganser.  amazing.  i have a copy of this in my office at home.
can not really focus on birds at the moment, pendergast.  I am tryin' to keep my breakfast down.
in this violent world, i believe the only way to stay sane is to take time to notice beautiful things.
i drink.  after hours of course.  on duty, i smoke.  do you mind?
not at all.  i enjoy the smell of a good cigar.
then you will not like this one.  it is a piece of shit.
lieutenant --
call me vince.
did you read about a boat that washed up outside of new orleans about four months ago?  twelve bodies on board.
who didn't?  big news.  out of brazil, was not it?
yes.  that is my case.  now it is yours. all the corpses were badly mutilated in a very particular way. decapitated.  brains extracted.  limbs torn to shreds.  it looked like the work of a large animal, but there was no sign of an animal on board.
so the method of death is the only connection?
no.  there is more.  there were crates from this museum in the hold of the boat.
uh, vince.  sorry.  this will not wait.
it better be good.
there are a couple of kids who were lost yesterday near the site of the murder.  claimed they saw a monster. they are pretty determined to tell you their story.  you want to see them?
no.
if you do not mind, this could be important.
you are kidding.
unfortunately, no.
we were just lost, okay?  and we went down this curvy staircase.  at the bottom was a big shadow.
big as a house.
not that big.
well almost.  depends which house.  it smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
and it snuffled the ground like a dog.
like this.
it had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
they were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
they were yellow!
you are color blind.
I have got to admit, that was a damn sight better than "the dog ate my homework".
how do you explain the part about beauregard?
they heard the victim's name and wove him into their story.  nice touch.
i believed them.
you think what we have got here is a monster as big as a house that smells... like hamburger?
no.  i think what we have got here is a psychotic killer wielding some kind of unusual weapon... who wants us to believe he is a monster.
oh.
we have met.  the hacksaw murders.  '89.
oh yes!  who could forget.  afterwards you sent me that amazing case of chateau lafitte.
i hope you liked it.
lovely bouquet.  after our last case, vince took me out for a draft beer. as i recall we split the check.
what are we talking about here?
someone who makes the hacksaw murderer look like mother teresa.
right.  the entire brain appears to have been extracted.  may i see it, please?
curious.  there is something missing.
the thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?
yes.  two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.
what happened to them?
if you do not mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.
saliva test?  you mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
correct.
i do not like animals.  never have. dog bit me when i was little.  after that i gave up on pets.  animals are irrational.  give me a psychotic killer any day.  if there is one thing that makes me queasy it is being part of a food chain.  my first case as a rookie, two brothers climbed a fence at the zoo.  it was late august.  over ninety.  the polar bear was inside his cave.  kids did not know he was in there.  all they saw was the pool. they got to swimming and splashing. the noise woke up the bear.  by the time i arrived, both little boys were in pieces.  the bear was dragging one kid around by the foot. i can still hear the mother screaming --
this is not an animal, vince.  I have been on this case four months, remember?  I have learned a few things.
you have been holding out on me pendergast.  you have a suspect capable of this?
special agent pendergast.  fbi. forgive me.  i guess i was snooping. what is this?
an invention of mine.  it is a computer program designed to describe the characteristics of a given species from a reading of its dna.  i call it the genetic sequence extrapolator.
how does it work?
with a dna analysis from a fossil you can use this program to tell the species and sex of the animal, whether it was nocturnal, what it ate, how it hunted, how big it was...  you are not here for a lesson in dna.
no.  i came to talk about dr. john whittlesley.
somehow, when all this happened... i knew it would come back to john.  is he really dead?
maybe not.
if he were alive he would have contacted me.
you have time to talk?
dr. whittlesley was last seen in belem, venezuela a week after the rest of his expedition disappeared. a taxi driver drove him to the harbor where he boarded a cargo boat.  that boat washed up in my district.  everyone on board was killed.
and john?
disappeared.  his body was not among the victims.
i do not understand.
the people killed were mauled and their brains were eaten.  just like beauregard.  one part of the brain was extracted with surgical precision.  the hypothalamus and thalamus to be exact.
john could not have anything to do with a horrible thing like that.  he was a fine man despite his problems --
you loved him.
yes.  once.  we met at columbia.  john held the cadwalader chair in statistical paleontology when i was a grad student there.
you were going to be married.
how did you know that?
i ran an internet search on dr. whittlesley.  got a list of his scholarly articles and the engagement announcement in the times.  i also found a record of your restraining order.
that was two years ago.  john was still in love with me.  he would not leave me alone.
you were afraid of him, were not you?
he was afraid of himself.  he tried suicide once.  he was ill.  manic depressive.  he had wild emotional highs and lows.  not a happy affliction for a scientist.  he would been revered in our community.  by the end he was a joke.
tell me about the last expedition. what was he looking for?
a legendary monster called mbwun.
a monster?
yes.  he developed his own theory that he called the calisto effect. it held that evolution was not always gradual or driven by natural selection.  the environment would sometimes cause sudden and grotesque changes which could result in a "monster species".  it made no sense. but he felt he had evidence that mbwun was such a monster, living in isolation on the tepui for thousands of years.
what happened?
no one knows.  the kothoga who live on the tepui are cannibals.
no.  I am all right.  i will not let this affect me anymore.  john would not get help.  his ego endangered the lives of others.  his theory came first.
what if whittlesley arrived on the tepui and no monster was there?  was he desperate enough to create one?
i do not understand.
something came up in autopsy tonight.  imbedded in beauregard's body we found a claw.
my god.  then it was an animal.
i do not think so.  i think we were meant to think it was mbwun.  did whittlesley's monster have claws?
i do not know.  he sent back a statue that is supposed to be an exact representation.  but I have never seen it.  it is in the exhibit.
would you mind showing it to me?
where would we find it?
I am not sure.  we should split up. you take that hall and I will take this one.
all right.  I am as macho as you are. perhaps.
what happened?
i do not know.
i heard you calling and i ran after you, but you kept disappearing and i could not keep up.
you were behind me?  running after me?
it is okay, I am all right.  i remember now... it was an animal.  something large!  i could smell it.  it was hunting me.  i saw two green eyes in the dark.
where did you see it?
behind me.  over there.
that is not what i saw.
all right.  if you are positive.
dr. green...
i did not imagine it.  i know what i saw.  are you sure there are enough men in there?
they are all heavily armed.
all right.  this is hard for me.  I am a scientist.  i like order and logic. sometimes too much.  there is got to be an explanation.  there can not be an animal in there.  but i saw something.
what was it?
i do not know.  mr. pendergast.  do me a favor.  get me a dna readout on that claw.
i had no idea the museum had a complete collection of piranesi's forum sketches.
if you like them, they are for sale. another day like yesterday and half the collection will be on the block.
I have read about the museum's financial troubles.
we have been operating in the red for years.  that was the whole idea behind the superstition exhibit.  it was designed to pull people in. we have spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. if we postpone at the last minute... no.  i do not want to think about that.
we all love the museum.  i come here myself with my kids.  we are trying to work with you.
i appreciate that.
if the party goes forward, and that is a big if... I have arranged for a large police presence.
do they have to wear uniforms?
yes.
i do not want to scare people.
i understand.  but mr. cuthbert, we have got bigger problems.  depending on what we find today, we may have to shut you down.
what do you make of it, margo?
it is not mammalian, that is for sure. i think it is reptilian.
turkish gecko, i believe.  a lizard.
lizard dna and human dna on the same strand?  impossible.  the sample must be contaminated.
there is another possibility.  a lot of repeated base pairs could suggest a high level of genetic damage.
genetic damage?
when dna is defective, it often uncontrollably replicates long repeating sequences of the same base pair.  viruses can damage dna.  so can radiation, certain chemicals.  even cancer.  let's let the g.s.e. sort it out.  i have to get started.  this will take several hours.
we need someone to take us to the secure storage area.
thank you for taking the time to help us with this, dr. frock.
happy to be useful.  it is rare enough these days.  according to security, beauregard put the whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
how many storage areas are there?
they fill seven floors.  we have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world.  just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens.  not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems.  only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.
this place is a maze.
I am one of the few who know every inch it, now that john is gone.
do you mean dr. whittlesley?
yes.  john made quite a study of the whole museum.  he had a copy of my original plans.
something tried to get into this room!
and failed.  these doors are solid steel.
this means there must be an animal loose in the museum!
i would not be so sure.
look.  it is some kind of letter.
may i see that?
it is from john.  those two arrows were his insignia.  it is addressed to louis moriarty, a patron who financed his expeditions.
read it out loud.
"dear louis, tomorrow we go to the south end of the tepui where we will be in the greatest danger, so I am sending carlos back with the crates.  you always believed in me, louis, even in the darkest days.  so it gives me great pleasure to tell you your faith has been rewarded.  we have made an incredible find.  i enclose a representation of mbwun.  note the exaggerated claws, the reptilian attributes, the hints of bipedalia. it is beyond belief, but this statue is accurate.  i know because I have seen the beast."
did you hear that?  my god.  he says that mbwun is real!
pardon my french, but bull shit.
this on top of the scratches... is not it proof!
you said john whittlesley made a study of your blueprints of the museum.
yes.
are there any hidden rooms or staircases?  places where someone could hide?
not really.  just the sub-basement.
where is that?
i do not know.  it was walled over.  no one's been down there in years.
you said you had plans of the museum.  could we see them, please?
how big is the sub-basement?
apparently it is huge.
i think i should come with you.
we have not got time.  you have to meet with museum security so we can make a decision about tonight.
this huge police presence tonight is not necessary, lieutenant.  you will just scare people off.  i can handle the security behind scenes with this system.  it is state of the art.
the cops are non-negotiable, ippolito.  why do not you just tell me how this space station works.
it is fool proof, basically.  i designed this whole thing myself. every valuable object in the museum carries a small electronic chip.  if anything's moved so much as an inch, we get an alarm pinpointing the exact location of the attempted theft.
that is great if you are stopping a burglar.  not our goal here.  are there motion detectors?
in every exhibition room.  the museum's divided into five cells. the reception and exhibit are in cell five.  we could arm the motion detectors in cells one to four, then seal the perimeter with our fire doors.
that would leave one exit for hundreds of people.  you would be violating every fire regulation on the books.  we will guard the perimeter with my men and engage the motion detectors in the other cells.  one more question.  i see a big hole.  if this entire thing is run by computer, what happens if the power fails?
you do not know much about computers, lieutenant.  there are safeguards built in.  we have back-up systems with redundancies.  there is no way these computers can fail.
i can not help thinking there is something that pendergast overlooked.  if the scratches were made by whatever killed beauregard, it wants something that is in here.
a blow dart.  seed pods.  a plant press.  pretty unimpressive stuff.
let me see the plant press.
what is it?
I am not sure.  as you know, the kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  this could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
whatever it is, it must be common on the tepui.  john used it as packing material.
you are right.
margo, these are not seed pods.
what are they?
they are eggs.
hard to read in this light.  the ink is so faded.
the dogs have lost the scent, mr. pendergast.  maybe we should head back.
not yet.  let's try the fork to the left.
they have got something.
keep the light up.  i can not see.
shut them up!
heel argo!  hobbes!  heel!
stop!
holy mother, what is that?
argo!  hobbes!
get back!  now!
there is something out there!  let's go get it now!  that is why we came down here, is not it?
he is right.  follow me.
look.  it is hobbes!  he is all right.
come on.  let's get back to the others.  we can not leave them alone.
it is alright.  i can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  what is this place?
not on the map.  looks like it connects with the city sewer.
oh... my... god!
quiet.
I am telling you, something is wrong. i still have not heard from pendergast.  i think you should call it off.
it is too late now.  guests are arriving.  the mayor's car is pulling up.
I will go down and speak to him.
you have not got the authority.  only pendergast can pull the plug.
pendergast may be in trouble.  do not you understand?  he still has not come back.  it is been over three hours --
he will be back.  relax.  we are in good shape.  your security is air tight. there've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious.  there is no reason to call off the opening now.
what kind of egg is it?
it is reptilian.
like the claw.
let's not jump to conclusions.  this egg could belong to any number of reptiles, dr. frock.
come on, margo.  we are on the verge of something huge.  let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room.  what if john was right.  i mean, what if?  and he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates.  when it got to the museum, it hatched.
several problems with that theory. for one thing, this egg is intact. for another, according to pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat.  everyone on board was killed like beauregard.  if the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
look at this.  an ambyloid reovirus protein.  that explains why the computer's confused.  the plant's infected with a virus.
that is not so unusual.  many plants carry viruses.  like the burls on maple trees.
but a virus normally codes for other viruses.  this one's making human and animal proteins.  listen to this.  "glycotetraglycine collagenoid. weinstein's tropic hormone.  4- monoxytocin supressin hormone."
these plant fibers are loaded with hormones!
what kind of hormones?
4-monoxytocin is... "a hormone secreted by the human hypothalamus gland."
try weinstein's tropic hormone.
this is it.  this is what he, or it... is after!  the plant has high concentrations of the same hormones found in minute quantities in the human brain!
so what?
pendergast told me the killer extracts and eats the hypothalamus and thalamus of the victim's brains!
eats them?
yes.  whatever killed beauregard may have lived on this plant.  when the crates were put in secure storage, they were out of reach.  the killer could not get them, so it got the next best thing.
all right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "species unidentified.  genus: unidentified.  phylum unknown.  male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  brain capacity, 900 centimeters." that means it is highly intelligent. "quadrupedal."
quadrupedal!  the other name for mbwun.  "he who walks on all fours."
"nocturnal.  external hair and bony plates.  locomotor speed 60-70 kilometers.  reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight.  "external mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "morphological characteristics: highly robust.  aggressiveness: extreme."
so the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.
with the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
margo, what you have just described is a killing machine.
and it is hungry.  it is been two days since it is eaten.  there are five hundred people arriving right now. the animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell!  all those people in one enclosed space...
it is like ringing the dinner bell.
lieutenant!  it is me.
what is it?
dr. green has to see you!
got my hands full here.
it is important.  please.  you have to come!  pendergast, too.  she is found out something.
what happened?!
there is a dead body in the exhibit! people are panicking, trampling each other trying to get out.
the whole system is shutting down! we have to get out quickly before the fire doors fall!
what doors?
i told you!  they seal off all the cells.  they were designed to fall automatically in a system failure --
you said the system could not fail!
ippolito!  get back here!
like hell!
what is going on?
some kind of power failure.  maybe it is the storm.  do you have a flashlight?
i think so.
dr. frock.  did you hear that?
do not stop now.
what is that?
it is one of the fire doors.  good lord, margo.  we are trapped!
jesus, what is this?
another storage room.
oh no.  i smell it.
keep the animal quiet.
pendergast?  are you all right?
no.  i think I am hallucinating.
you are not.  where is it?
gone.
wounded?
no.  a chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball.  i think it was bothered by my light.
that would fit.  it is nocturnal. quick.  come inside.
manual overrides are not working.  I am getting nothing, lieutenant.
great.
there is some kind of animal loose in the museum.  pendergast's alone.  he needs help.  i want volunteers to go with me.
I am in.
sweet jesus!
get his gun and his walkie talkie, jonathan.  move.
my office is on the third floor! there is a walk-in safe and a portable phone!  we can lock ourselves in the safe and call for help!
i have to help pendergast.  kawakita and jonathan stay with me.  the rest of you can go with cuthbert!
d'agosta?  ippolito.  come in.
where the hell are you?
i made it outside.  I will co-ordinate the rescue efforts from here.  help is on the way.  just sit tight.
it is a little late, you son of a bitch.  there is a friggin' monster loose in here!  get the fbi, the fire department.  find metal cutters, cut through.  and bring a cannon.  the damn thing is huge.
i do not know how to deal with this. it is hellish.  like nothing i ever saw.  I am not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
it is not supernatural.  mbwun is an animal.  part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of vietnam.
but this is not the jungle!  this is new york.  how did it get here?  a thing like that crossed two continents.  it makes no sense!
we think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
i do not believe it.
none of that matters now.  the people upstairs need us.  we have to help.
we can't.  we have managed to get inside the one place that is safe.  i think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  if we go outside, we are risking more lives. you have to accept it, margo, there is nothing we can do.  the building must be swarming with police by now.  it will not take long for them to get through the doors.
that thing could kill ten people in a matter of minutes.
but what can we do?  our guns are useless --
we have the fibers.  do not you see? the creature is hungry.  it wants the hormones in these plants.  it would take hundreds of human brains to supply what is in these fibers.  we are just a poor substitute.  to make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
i got it after i was mugged in the subway last spring.
where is the walk-in safe?
behind you.
what is the combination?
I will do it.  just let me find my portable phone.
forget it!
calm down.  i found it!
battery's dead.  shit.
let's go!
that thing will not come after us, right?  it is going for bigger game. the group blundering around in the basement.  poor fools.
hurry up!
just a minute.  I am shaking!  take the gun.
for chrissake, I will do it.  what is the combination?!
to the left twice then five no... sorry... i think it is fifteen... it is been a while...
oh jesus...
fifteen... what is next?
eight to the right!  look!  i found it!
I am coming with you.
no, dr. frock.  you can't.
you would slow us down and put margo in danger.
unlock one of the other storage rooms.  we are going upstairs.  we will leave a trail back to 1012 and try to trap the monster in here.
margo, this is too dangerous.  you always think you can solve everything.  this time you do not have enough information.  the animal might behave in unexpected ways.  leave her here with me.  do not put her in danger.
he is right.
what is that?
footsteps!
come back and get me.
we will.
remember, it has poor eyesight.  it hunts with its sense of smell.  so for god's sake, margo, do not get those fibers on your clothes!
it is still back there!
i know.
that was d'agosta.
the planetarium!
vince!
pendergast!  help!  it is right behind us!
this door's locked.  try shooting the hinges off.
is dr. frock safe!
yes, he is fine.  greg... take care of yourself!
is there another way around?
no.  the planetarium is in the next cell.  this is one of the fire doors...
vince?  there is no way we can get to you with the fire doors down. there is an entrance to the sub- basement in the hall off the north side exit.
the sub-basement?
I have been down there.  it links up to the old sewer system.  i can guide you out.
how much ammo do we have to make a stand?
you are asking me?  i do not even know how to load this thing.
i smell it.  it is here.
go out the north exit!  there is a hallway and a false wall by the greek vases.  run!
everybody.  get behind me.
hide quickly!
what are you going to do?
what is it doing?
it is scared of me.
what happened?
its eyesight is worse than i thought.  it could not see us.  and it could not smell us through the glass.
it did not want the fibers.  what does that mean?
i think... it means it is full.
then it will not go after the others?
no.  it is still hunting, but not for the hormones.
for what?
i think... for the pleasure of the kill.
all right.  kawakita, cover the rear.
oh shit.
we have to try and draw it off!
how?
the answer's right in front of us.
that is a ptarmigan, feigning a broken wing.  the bird pretends to be injured to draw the fox away from its nest!
it is deceptively simple.  like a bruckner symphony or a matisse.
help someone!
oh god!  help!
you smell that?
it is coming.  run.
i believe in you a hundred percent, vince, but that is the second time we have been at that intersection.
not so loud.
what is that?
all right everybody, hold up!
what does it say?
dr. john whittlesley.
what is that doing here?
i do not know.  i thought dr. whittlesley died in south america.
dear god.  where are we, lieutenant?
I would say we are in its home.
we are not going to make the storage room!
listen to me, pendergast.  mbwun's dna is part homo sapien.  in primates, the eye is a direct path to the brain!  if you get a clean shot, there is only one place you can kill it.  shoot it in the eye!
no!  do not kill him!  pendergast, you were right.  it is john!
what?
that thing is john whittlesley.  i should have seen it before!  the fibers are infected with a virus. you eat them, and the virus alters your dna!  he became addicted to them in south america, followed the plants back to the states.  he probably entered the country as a man.  it would have taken several months for the change to take place. that is how he got from the boat to the museum!
i do not believe it.
you have to!  listen!  all viruses pass on their own dna.  instruct the cells of the host to make more viruses!  this one was different.  it inserted a whole array of genes into john.  reptile genes, sixty five million years old.  those genes remade him!  it is not his fault!
whatever that thing is, we have to kill it!
just like john.  he will not listen.
i have to shoot.
do it, quickly.  please.  aim for the eye.
he has to look here or i will not get a clear shot.  call him, margo.
i can't!
you have to.  do it now!
nice to see you, lieutenant.
the sub-basement, huh?  great idea.
got to finish this thesis sometime.
how about lunch?
not today.  besides, i think the director of the museum is expecting you.
okay.
dr. frock?
look who is here, margo.
I am so glad to see you.  what is the occasion?
I am in town on a case.  dropped by to see vince and we thought we would see the new display.
dr. frock, i was wondering.  what happened to the rest of whittlesley's plants?
they were sent to the center for disease control in atlanta.
should not a drug that powerful be destroyed?
the virus itself might have positive applications.  they will keep the plants in secure lock up while the studies are made.  greg is not joining us?
