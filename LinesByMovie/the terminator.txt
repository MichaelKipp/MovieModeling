yes, chuck?
come to the office, please.
mission control to chuck, come in...
you're late.
aren't i worth waiting for?
not really.  do you think you can get here on time if i put you on the floor as a waitress?
i don't know.  i kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
the pay's the same but you'll make more in tips.
thanks, chuck.  i need the money.  can i still work the hours around my classes?
mmm.  same schedule's okay.
alright!
can you handle it?
it's not brain surgery, chuck.
here you go.  you're a bob's girl now.  nancy will check you out.
i won't let the fat kid down.
anything else?
a phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
just what you see, pal.
the uzi 9 millimeter.
you know your weapons, buddy.
any one of them's ideal for home defense. which'll it be?
all.
you can't to that...
wrong.
i haven't seen you in here lately, mr. miller.
what's it to ya?
you must have a girlfriend.
that's none of your business.
aha!  is she young?
compared to me she is.  how come you're not at the cash anymore?  they catch ya steal- ing?
what's it to ya?
i had him hooked.  he was just about to ask me out. i could tell.
that guy's a jerk.  i did you a favor.
i'll do the same for you sometime.
what do you think?
great.
great.
you're a big help.
alright, the beige one.
i hate the beige one.
don't wear the beige one.
give me the short version.
six shots at less than ten feet.  weapon was a large caliber--
okay, let's see...got a pos- itive on her.  she's sarah connor, works as a legal--
that can't be right.  that's the name of the one valley division mopped up this after- noon.
here's her driver's license.
you gotta be kidding me.  the new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  a one-day pattern killer.
i hate the weird ones.
not lately.  did you check messages?
i thought you did.
that bum.  so what if he has a porsche, he can't treat you like that...it's friday night for crissakes.

i'm going to a movie, kiddo. see ya'.  you and matt have a good time.
we will, kiddo.
that stuff's two hours cold.
i know.
i put a cigarette out in it.
did you reach the next girl yet?
no.  keep getting an answer- ing machine.
send a unit.
i already did.  no answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  i'm keeping them there.
call her.
i just called.
call her again.
same shit.
i can hear it now, it's gonna be the goddamned 'phone book killer'.
i hate the press cases. especially the weird press cases.  where you going?
to make a statement. i'm gonna give them the name.  maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
if they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  how do i look?
like shit, boss.
...look, lieutenant...uh, vukovich, don't put me on hold and don't transfer me to another department...
i won't.  now just relax. where are you?  yeah, i know it...on pico. are you alright?
yes, but i don't want to leave.  i think this guy's following me.
alright, ms. connor.  listen carefully.  you're in a public place, you'll be safe 'til we get there.  stay visible. don't go outside or in the restroom.  i'll be there in a few minutes.
go!  go!  he's got her.
suspect westbound on olympic.  grey sedan.  has hostage, repeat...
do you understand?
yes.  don't hurt me.
i'm here to help you.  reese, sergeant/tech-com, dn38416...
this is a mistake.  i haven't done anything.
no. but you will.  it's very important that you live.
but outside, it's living human tissue.  flesh, skin, hair...blood.  grown for the cyborgs.
look, reese, i know you want to help, but...
pay attention.  the 600 series had rubber skin. we spotted them easy.  but these are new.  they look human.  sweat, bad breath, everything.  very hard to spot.  i had to wait 'til he moved on you before i could zero him.
hey, i'm not stupid, y'know. they can't build anything like that yet.
no.  not yet.  not for about forty years.
so, it's from the future, is that right?
one possible future.  four your point of view.  i don't know the tech stuff.
and you're from the future too?
right.
just let me go.
listen.  understand.  that terminator is out there.  it can't be reasoned with, it can't be bargained with...it doesn't feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. ever.  until you are dead.
there's so much...
tell me.  just start at the beginning.
--everythingis gone.  just gone.  there were survivors. here.  there.  nobody knew who started it.  it was the machines.
i don't understand...
defense network computer. new. powerful.  hooked into everything. trusted to run it all.  they say it got smart...a new order of intelli- gence.  then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side.  decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination.
didn't see the war.  i was born after, in the ruins.  grew up there.  starving.  hiding from the h-k's.
the what?
hunter killers.  patrol machines. build in automated factories. most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.
here, drink some of this...
lieutenant, are you sure it's them?  maybe i should see the ...bodies.
they've already been identi- fied.  there's no doubt.
sarah.  sarah, this is dr. silber- man.  i'd like you to tell him everything reese said to you.  do you feel up to it?
i guess so.  you're a doctor?
so.  you're a soldier. fighting for whom?
with the one thirty second under perry, from '21 to '27--
the year 2027?
and who was the enemy?
skynet.  a computer defense system built for sac-norad by cyber dynamics.  a modified series 4800.
i see.  and this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  a sort of retroactive abortion?
yes.
that silberman just crack me up.  he had this guy in here last week who set his afghan on fire. screwed it first, then set it on--
shut up.
...it had no choice. the defensive grid was smashed. we'd taken the mainframes... we'd won.  taking out connor then would make no difference.  skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  we captured the lab complex.  found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. the terminator had already gone through.  they sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. sumner didn't make it.
then how are you supposed to get back?
can't.  nobody goes home. nobody else comes through. it's just him and me.
you go naked.  something about the field generated by a living organism.  nothing dead will go.
why?
i didn't build the fucking thing.
okay.  okay.  but this...  cyborg...if it's metal...
surrounded by living tissue.
of course.
why were the other two women killed?
most official records were lost in the war.  the computer knew almost nothing about connor's mother.  her name. where she lived, just the city. no scanner pictures.  the terminator was just being systematic.
you've heard enough.  decide. are you going to release me?
i'm afraid that's not up to me.
then why am i talking to you? get out.
i can help you...
who is in authority here?
why don't you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  it'll take your mom a good hour to get here from redlands.
i can't sleep.
go ahead.  you're safe.  there're thirty cops in this building.
okay.
you cold?
freezing.
come here.
reese...you got a first name?
kyle.
kyle, what's it like when you go through time?
white light.  pain.  like being ripped inside out... slowly.  like being born, maybe.
i caught one, back there.
caught one?  you mean you got shot?
we gotta get you to a doctor.
it's okay.  forget it.
forget it?  are you crazy? let me see it.
this is gonna make me puke. talk about something.
what?
just talk.  tell me about my son.  is he tall?
what's he like?
you trust him.  he's got that strength.  you'd die in a second for john.
well, at least i know what to name him.  i don't suppose you'd know who the father is? so i don't tell him to get lost when i meet him.
john never said much about him.  he dies.  even before the war...
stop!  i don't want to know. hold still.  so...it was john that ordered you here?
i volunteered.
you volunteered?
it was an honor.  a chance to meet the legend.  sarah connor.  who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. from when he was a kid.  when you were in hiding, before the war.
i'm sure.
come on, me? the mother of the future?  am i tough? organized?  i can't even balance my checkbook.  i cry when i see a cat that's been run over... and i don't even like cats.
ow!  no, it's okay.  it's better tight.
and anyway, what do i know about guerrilla warfare?
you'll learn.
look, reese, i didn't ask for this honor and i don't want it. any of it.
john gave me a message for you.  made me memorize it. 'sarah"...this is the message... 'sarah, thank you.  for your courage through the dark years. i can't help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will.  you must be stronger than you imagine you can be.  you must survive, or i will never exist.'  that's all.
good field-dressing.
you like it?  it's my first.
sleep.  it'll be light soon.
okay.  talk some more.
about what?
about where you're from.
bag some z's?
let's get cleaned up, kyle.
thanks a lot.
what's that?
that's where we're going.
why?
look.  i found it.  isn't that it?  cyber dynamics corporation?
what about it?
didn't you say that they're going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
molecular-memory.
whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build el computer grande...skynet...for the government.  right?
that's the way it was told to me.
well, we're gonna uninvent the bastard.  eighty-six it.  we'll blow up the place...burn it down.  something.
tactically dangerous.  we lay low.
reese.  think it through. we can prevent the war. nobody else is gonna do it. if we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  we have to so it ourselves.
that's not my mission.
listen.  understand.  i'm not a military objective, reese.  i'm a person... you don't own me.
let's go.  time to move out.
fuck you!  let go of me!
kyle?
i'm wrong here.  i wasn't meant to see this...
is this enough?
yes.  and i don't want to know where you got it.
i'm dying for a shower.  you could use one too.  and we'd better check that bandage.
later.  i'm going out for materiel.  keep this.
what's that?
nitroglycerin, basically. bit more stable.  i learned howto make it when i was a kid.
make sure there's none on the threads, like this.  now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
you must have had a fun child-
that's good.  now, seven more like that while i make fuses.
i was thinking, there's so much i've got to show you when we get through this. it's mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
hot dogs?
i want to buy you a hot dog so bad,kyle...all the things you've never seen and done.  you're here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
my whole life has been combat.
i want it to be over for you.
not possible.
i want it to be over for me too. i feel like i slipped over some invisible line, that i'm in your world now.  everything's the same, but i see it differently. it's like, there's you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
he'll find us, won't he?
probably.  sarah, if i get zeroed...
don't say that.
if i do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. different country, different name, everything.  in case they send another one.
it'll never be over, will it? look at me, i'm shaking. some legend, huh?  you must be pretty disappointed.
no.  i'm not.
kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
good fighters.
that's not what i meant. was there someone special?
someone?
a girl.  you know.
no.  never.
so much pain.
pain can be controlled. you disconnect it.
and so you feel nothing.
it's better that way.
oh, kyle.
i'm sorry.  i shouldn't have said...
kyle...
i bet you're ticklish.
ticklish?
what are you doing?
you'll beg for mercy in a second.
i don't think i like this.
you're not supposed to.
sarah.
we did it, kyle.  we got it.
what are you doing?
cover...our footsteps...
