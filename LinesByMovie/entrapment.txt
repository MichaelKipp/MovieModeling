where were you? i called at 4:30 this morning.
there are times when you don't answer the phone.
you didn't answer the beeper either.
i hardly knew the guy. why be impolite to strangers?
i don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
i don't recall asking your permission.
a thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. what we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
through a window.
the windows don't open.
entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
so he popped the pane?
bingo.
that's great if you're a computer. in the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. the building's 600 feet high.
he unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. no more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
interesting theory. where's the proof?
you ordering chop suey again?
let a thousand flowers bloom. chairman mao.
meaning--
meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. he left the window open when he came in. his only mistake.
and the draft blew over the flowers.
put the bolts on that window under a scope, i'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them.
mac's signature.
give me a break. remember manzini? when he stole montezuma's scepter he left a pepto bismal bottle. the best ones always copy mac.
you're saying the thief wants us to think it's mac but it's really not.
exactly.
they've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
you got a better idea?
yeah. me.
we've got to catch him in the act.
why didn't i think of that?
it's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
with that computer--nobody better. out there...it's different. you twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on madison avenue.
i've been following this guy for years. i'm your best shot.
how would you approach him? hello, mr. macdougal, i'm gin, would you steal a painting with me?
i'd need an introduction. from someone he trusts. someone who owes us a favor.
that's doable.
and a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
which you have in mind.
i have a question...
who am i?
that is of no interest.
why are we speaking chinese?
uh. i'm showing off.
a billion people speak chinese. don't be too impressed with yourself. as for that scroll, i can resell it for double. in 30 minutes.
no you can't.
i can't?
it's sold.
how about if i try humility.
how about if you try disappearing.
mr. macdougal.
you're like malaria. once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
i'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
where did you hear that, one of those american talk shows?  check, please.
i don't want to waste your time.
then don't.
i have a proposal for you.
believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, i'd have one for you.
something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
you have a car?
uh, yes.
meet me in front. five minutes.
seems i am.
i'll call an ambulance.
it's nothing serious. i'll just run into that building. they'll have some sort of first aid kit.
you disappeared.
you seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
are you...okay?
it was only a scratch. far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
that's good. terrific.
i don't care about the damned car. my luggage's been stolen.
you're joking.  you can't trust anyone these days.
yes. but they don't have a clue.  why would anyone steal my luggage?
maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. you are in the business, that's what roki says.
like i would have art in my suitcase.
of course you wouldn't. the rembrandt wouldn't fit.
excuse me?
i've got something...
i sincerely hope so.
you're not taking me seriously.
oh, i'm taking you...quite seriously.
i didn't expect you to be so...
so what?
so alive.
do you mind?
you...you can't.
of course i can. i have a note from mother.
you're shaking. are you nervous?
no. why would i be?
because you young americans think the world began when you were born. you fall apart when you don't get your own way.
i've got something for you.
oh, that's quite all right. no charge.
and i thought we were getting on so well.
we were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
not interested.
are you under the impression that now i'm in some way obligated to you?
well, no...but...
good. i'll call the concierge. they can get you a new room, book your flight home, so forth.
for god's sake.
i'm sorry. this just means so much to me.
the empress death mask.
the most important piece of chinese art outside of china.
somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
that old pirate chiang kai shek personally took this to taiwan when he was run out of china in 1949. peking would dearly love to have this back...
i suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
it's not for sale.
i know.
so you've heard all those stories about me. well, i can assure you they're not true. and if they were true, i've retired.
but roki said--
roki has a vivid imagination.
besides, if i lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which i do not--i wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. i'd do it myself.
you can't.
oh?
it's only on exhibit at the queen's museum this month. even if you could get into the museum, the mask bas its own security system. a special, randomly programmed interval code.
we going somewhere?
possibly.
maybe i should drive this time.
maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
very nice.
not a word.
you want me to pick up a painting?
quite a good one. a monet. not major, but it is giverney.
i'm not here to run errands. i'm here for the mask.
if i can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can i trust you about the mask?
it's a test.
that's my girl.
fine. what do i do?
it's simple. you pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
how much am i paying?
i'm paying...one point five million and change. i hate round numbers.
it's a fake.
give him the card.
but--
can you follow simple directions?
i'm telling you it's a forgery. the paint's still wet for god's sake.
look on the back. what do you see?
a film case.
that's what you're buying. put it in your pocket.
he says they turned the card down.
damn, i knew i forgot something.
not funny.
what the hell do i do now?
up to you. you could tell him the check is in the mail.
what the hell was that?
not bad. i didn't expect you to make it out.
you what--?
motorcycle.
got it.
it's one way.
we're only going one way.
we're going to die, aren't we...
i'm not the one to ask...
what about your bags?
i never carry...baggage.
those are my clothes.
certainly not mine. come on.
you stole my luggage? you--
i'm a thief. sue me.
where's my bag?
that's entrapment.
no. entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
i don't believe this.
what's your problem? i'm doing the job.
what's my problem? you want a list?
you really don't believe i'd take on a partner after all these years without a little...insurance?
lose something?
i'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
and--
i'm impressed. can't spot a thing.
hmmm. i'd be surprised if you could.
nothing? you don't even lock the door?
i guess i have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?
my job, my rules. we've got a job to do. no mixing business and pleasure.
you're late.
<u>i'm</u> dressed.
and good morning.
good morning.
nice spot.
it is.  coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. we'll start in twenty minutes.
i know it well.
as i recall, you've robbed it before.
years ago, if memory serves. when does the exhibit end?
in a week.
only a week?
they're having a farewell party the last night. before the mask goes back to taiwan.
that's when we'll do it. and we'll need every single day.
so the duke dug a tunnel--just in case. they made the lake a hundred years later. flooded the tunnel.
we go underwater?
we? are you implying that i'm taking you inside?
we're doing this together. we're partners.
precisely. you give me the mask security code, i steal the mask, you get a finders fee. at ten percent, should be two or three million at least. not too bad.
i go in alone.
you don't get the mask code unless i go.
pack up. i'll see you get back to london.
look, i can help. you need a sensor expert. you've got one.
this isn't some picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room.
you don't have any idea how lucky you are!
a lifelong problem, i'm afraid.
no, dammit! i mean me! that rembrandt...that rembrandt!
nice try. everyone thinks i did.
that's because i wanted them to!
i wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
i drilled the bolts and went in through the window. it was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
true enough.
you need a partner for this job. you'll never find one as good as me.
the rembrandt--that was quite good.
it was perfect.
someone was expecting that.
you're too easily impressed with yourself. i believe i've made that point before.
i'll need that.
no one <u>needs</u> anything except food and shelter. the rest we just want.
this isn't a good time to hear your personal philosophy.
don't worry, i can get rid of this. no trace. and i'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
no. it's a down payment.
on what? another job?
we get the mask i'll tell you.
a partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
without the mask it doesn't matter.
so the mask is part of the down payment too. must be a really big job.
let's just see how we do.
so you're testing <u>me</u> now?
oh, i think you can do it. probably.
why don't we take oxygen?
we are...for the tools.
let's do it again.
try laps. say a hundred.
i'm not real big on collecting banged up ferraris at airports.
next time i'll use valet parking.
they work off the o2 tank just like the slice pack.
which is--
in the van.
tina was a wonderful woman.
don't go getting sentimental. you're no damn good at it.
i'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
and you do it so well.
the porta power...comm kits...got the ir/thermo camera?
had to get a liquid plasma screen.
the key to success is using the right tools.
you're not the one trying to get all this shit. you think they've just got a crooks r us on every corner?
we're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. the air filters might be wired. and a bypass hose for the ac.
sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
if we don't bypass it, the temperature in the mask room will change and set off the alarm. that would be inconvenient.
inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
you are a miracle worker.
we might not want to cash in our chips just yet. she has another job after this one. a big one.
this is big enough.
it's never big enough.
let me ask you, this mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
it's a death mask. death mask means dead.
right.
because i never assume anything.
i need you to get one more thing for me. a dress, elegant but sexy, something grace kelly would wear. maybe a balenciaga.
that's it, i sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
black of course.
i'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
this better be worth 1t.
oh, it is.
it better be worth it for me.
did i hear a car?
our equipment has arrived.
hmmm.
all this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
it was a long time ago.
i didn't mean to get personal.
yes you did.
so how long to pop the floor?
twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
and you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
a dozen times.
the lipstick thermal camera?
got it.
charged?
charged. receiver?
that's it. we're ready.
one more item--not on the check list.
i trust it's your size.
it's---beautiful.
you bought this for me?
don't get any ideas. of course it comes out of your share.
thank you.
thank you.
no, no, i want to. i'll just go into the village.
it's not a village. there's nothing there.
won't take any time.
straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. don't blink, you'll miss it.
you don't call, you don't write.
this was my first excuse to get away. i can't exactly use my cell phone.
yeah yeah yeah. what's the status?
we're getting close.
how close?
i don't know, but close.
this is dangerous. i'm sending backup.
you, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
don't overestimate yourself.
look, trust me. i know what i'm doing.
where are you at least?
i'll send you a postcard. got to go.
certainly the most beautiful crook i've ever seen.
i've got something for you.
aren't we early?
little celebration before we set off.
to us. to the mask.
to our...partnership.
you're nervous again.
when i was a girl my father took me to the edge of el capitan. three thousand feet of granite. straight down. i was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. i couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
you were afraid of heights?
terrified. still am.
how in the devil did you do the rembrandt then?
i had a lifeline. if i've got a lifeline, i'm okay.
aren't we all.
my father told me not to be afraid. he'd always be there for me.
he wasn't.
so you had to be your own lifeline.
something like that.
and--
he pulled back his arms and blam, i landed right on the floor. i picked myself up, tears in my eyes, and he looked at me and he said, son, don't ever trust anybody. anybody.
camera in the--
bookshelf. sensors--
popup, on floorboards. and--
in eye of that painting.
we're working.
it's a party.
let's mingle a little, shall we?
i said a masked ball, not a costume party.
how the hell i'm supposed to know the damn difference?
you look like george washington.
i cannot tell you a goddamned lie. she's selling you a pig in a poke. we better do this tonight.
it's too soon.
the early bird gets the damn worm.
but the second mouse gets the cheese.
so patience, thibeau, patience. trust me.
remind me why.
because it pays off.
you two make quite a couple.
we're supposed to.
you better not be taking on a new partner.
suspicious, after all these years?
you change partners, you change the rules.
oh, look at me, darling. i thought this gentleman was a waiter.
you damn well thought wrong.
i'm terribly sorry old man.
one, two, three...
you're not on the beat.
don't turn. i'm counting the steps to the entrance.
these rooms are solid stone. they haven't changed.
you can't be too careful.
yes, you can.  you can spoil a perfectly nice dance.
ready?
ready.
can you see the other pirs?
got it.
they moved it.
behind you.
be careful not to break the laser beams.
duh.
careful...careful.
shut up.
we did it.
the mask.
now's when you tell me who you really are.
what?
you're playing both sides of the street. you're going to keep the mask and turn me in.
no, no, please god, you're wrong. i'm a thief. just like you.
okay, you're a thief.
yes. yes.
what do i need a thief for? i've got the mask.
stop! you're making...mistake.
it's your mistake.
the big job.
there is no big job.
what?
a billion dollars.
your share.
get the hell in.
we're living history here.
you don't know the half of it.
i like banks.  that's where the money is.
speaking of money. you said billions. how many?
if you want a partner, i think you should recalculate the split.
okay, 80-20--
no, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
my eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
it's fifty-fifty, less the cost of the dress.
come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?
hold the record. alone.
hmmm...44 long.
i always knew you'd do the job.
you've got everything planned.
everything.
i'll need the rembrandt now.
sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
i told you. it's the down payment. and thanks to you it's overdue.
insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
okay, look, i'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. but it's pointless to try to explain it yet. you just have to trust me. i don't have any more secrets.
everyone has secrets, it's what makes us human.
idle hands, the devil's workshop.
there's food in the fridge. i won't be long.
a true master. classic, yet extremely sexual, don't you think?
we need to make the trade tomorrow.
always in a rush.
you should know, when i come back here with the mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the prc.
gin, really.
tomorrow. it has to be tomorrow. or forget the mask.
tonight your league night?
check out my ball.
doesn't look like much. how come those commos want it so bad?
it's not just art, it's history. something you americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
that's because we live in the future. which is what's on my mind.
this is just show and tell.
i'm waiting for the tell part.
she's calling the shots now.
you're impressed with her, aren't you?
she's good. give her that. almost as good as she thinks she is.
she reminds you of yourself. there's nobody you admire more.
my antenna is up, it is fully extended, and i am picking up...what is it? it is, can it be? the boy is in el, u, v.
it's never happened before. what makes you think it's happening now?
you better be keeping your mind on business. it's not just me you got to worry about. i've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
you know where my loyalties lie.
to yourself, that's where.
you'll just have to have faith.
faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. i got to have trust.
she won't tell me everything. it's a bank job, that's all i know.
thirty-five next generation microchips. copper, not silicon. value: one million each.
you're giving them to me?
call it an expression of trust.
thought you had to use some of these.
you don't really think i'd leave ten million dollars worth of our chips in her bag?  what matters isn't what's real. it's what we <u>think</u> is real--what matters is the art.
take this mask. it may look like the empress, but it's not.
i figured that out.
the face decays, the mask doesn't. art lasts, we don't. that's why art's so valuable. it's a little piece of immortality.
you got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
i really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
did i ever tell you what tina wrote? the night she died?
my friend, you always surprise me.
we wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? and they don't come off. but when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
the mask. where is it?
you took the rembrandt, i figured it was a fair trade.
do you know what you've done!? do you know?
would you quiet down! just for a minute?
oh my god, i thought--
i'd taken the mask?
what about the rules?
my job, my rules.
gin? where the hell are you?
i'm in the middle.
in the middle? you've got the mask, why don't we have him?
he's on to something bigger.
listen to me. whatever you're doing, stop. pull out.
too late now.
tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so i can trace you.
i'm going to get him, i promise you.
well...what are we doing?
you're being useless. i'm making us rich.
currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
transfer.
the eight billion. from them to us.
right. the eight billion.
what's that?
guest lists of every a-list party on turnover night. they'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.
peoples china bank.
where the money is.
it's taken me five years at webber insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this cd. it has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. total, eight billion and change.
and the money goes--
every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. as soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. it ends up so clean the mafia couldn't find it.
but those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
nope. the cd instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded xj-6.
a parting gift from the empire.
sit down, i'll show you how we're going to do it.
the oscilloscope's already programmed.
it's no good without the argon gas.
got it.
then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
that's where the mask comes in.
you've thought of everything.
so how long till we do this?
we're doing it tonight.
you can't be serious.
that's the beauty of it. there's only one tiny window of time when this will work. at the handover of hong kong--from britain to china. the handover from them to us.
you're out of your mind. we can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
there's no way to practice this. and no time. besides, i've planned it all. there aren't any surprises.
there's always a surprise.
i've covered everything. and you're the best, so--
you're overestimating yourself again. what's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. you've done that a dozen times.
for god's sake, the only way i can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
feeling old?
how do i look?
like a woman of mystery.
access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...
can't be too careful.
two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
let me guess. his retinal plate is in there.
pulse detectors.
charged.
parachute.
packed.
done.  and i assume you have the magic cd- rom?
surgically attached.
no way to take another day or two?
no. you'll see when we get inside.
you shouldn't have.
can't break tradition. it's bad luck.
there is one more thing.
you have something in mind?
call it a new tradition.
that was a lifetime ago.
it was wrong to deceive you.
but that's all behind us now.
but would you--would you--
have really held you under?
of course not. it was just a negotiating ploy.
nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
i'm sorry.
so what are you going to do with your share?
oh, i don't care about the money.
four billion dollars.
seen one billion, seen them all.
that's because you grew up rich.
a flaw in your research, my dear. i grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.
not for me.
what? another job? stealing the eiffel tower?
i'm going to disappear. i die in a car crash in taiwan. very easy to do.
they drive so recklessly there.
i'm leaving from the nathan road station at 6:30 tomorrow morning. you could come too.
the sign of our partnership.
brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
and when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction xj6 was really about...
china will think it happened before midnight. britain will swear it happened after midnight...
they'll each be positive the other guy did it.  i fear an ugly international incident.
jesus god, it's going through.
hong kong midnight, happy new year. except at china bank.
relax, don't jam it...
fucking thing!!!
don't panic, now, there's no rush...
we can't leave it in there, it's got all our accounts, everything that can nail us to a goddam cross!!!
move it, what are you waiting f...
the disc is still in there.
we can't help it, we...we've gotta...
the door's the only way out!
i sincerely hope not.
jesus.
you can do it.
come on.
no way.
go!
hang on.
get out of here!
i cannot get rid of you.
no, you can't.
put this on!
i'm not leaving without you.
what's wrong.
nothing is wrong. everything is the way it has to be. in my left coat pocket is a packet. passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
take the airport subway, but change at jordan station for kowloon tong.
but--
it's only ninety seconds up the line. you're on a connection to a trans siberian express.
what about you?
you have the right to remain silent. but anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you--
my god--
--you're a cop.
both sides of the street, i'm afraid.
he looks familiar.
that would be thibadeaux. the cop i work for every now and then. catching thieves. the really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
they've been on to you all along. knew you had a big job going.
you gave them the eight billion.
you mean the seven billion.
takes a lot out of you, one like this.
yes it does.
i been meaning to tell you, far as i'm concerned you're over the hill.
see you.
probably not.
yeah. probably not.
