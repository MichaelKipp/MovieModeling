where were you? i called at 4:30 this morning.
there are times when you do not answer the phone.
you did not answer the beeper either.
i hardly knew the guy. why be impolite to strangers?
i do not recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
i do not recall asking your permission.
a thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. what we do not get is how he effectuated his entry.
through a window.
the windows do not open.
entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
so he popped the pane?
bingo.
that is great if you are a computer. in the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. the building's 600 feet high.
he unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. no more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
interesting theory. where is the proof?
you ordering chop suey again?
let a thousand flowers bloom. chairman mao.
meaning--
meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. he left the window open when he came in. his only mistake.
and the draft blew over the flowers.
put the bolts on that window under a scope, I am betting you will find wrench scratches on them.
mac's signature.
give me a break. remember manzini? when he stole montezuma's scepter he left a pepto bismal bottle. the best ones always copy mac.
you are saying the thief wants us to think it is mac but it is really not.
exactly.
they have never caught him before, what makes you think they will catch him now?
you got a better idea?
yeah. me.
we have got to catch him in the act.
why did not i think of that?
it is not the thinking of it, it is the doing it.
with that computer--nobody better. out there...it's different. you twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on madison avenue.
I have been following this guy for years. I am your best shot.
how would you approach him? hello, mr. macdougal, I am gin, would you steal a painting with me?
I would need an introduction. from someone he trusts. someone who owes us a favor.
that is doable.
and a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
which you have in mind.
i have a question...
who am i?
that is of no interest.
why are we speaking chinese?
uh. I am showing off.
a billion people speak chinese. do not be too impressed with yourself. as for that scroll, i can resell it for double. in 30 minutes.
no you can't.
i can't?
it is sold.
how about if i try humility.
how about if you try disappearing.
mr. macdougal.
you are like malaria. once you get it, you can not get rid of it.
I am sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
where did you hear that, one of those american talk shows?  check, please.
i do not want to waste your time.
then don't.
i have a proposal for you.
believe me, if you were not so tiresome, I would have one for you.
something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
you have a car?
uh, yes.
meet me in front. five minutes.
seems i am.
I will call an ambulance.
it is nothing serious. I will just run into that building. they will have some sort of first aid kit.
you disappeared.
you seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
are you...okay?
it was only a scratch. far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
that is good. terrific.
i do not care about the damned car. my luggage's been stolen.
you are joking.  you can not trust anyone these days.
yes. but they do not have a clue.  why would anyone steal my luggage?
maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. you are in the business, that is what roki says.
like i would have art in my suitcase.
of course you wouldn't. the rembrandt would not fit.
excuse me?
I have got something...
i sincerely hope so.
you are not taking me seriously.
oh, I am taking you...quite seriously.
i did not expect you to be so...
so what?
so alive.
do you mind?
you...you can't.
of course i can. i have a note from mother.
you are shaking. are you nervous?
no. why would i be?
because you young americans think the world began when you were born. you fall apart when you do not get your own way.
I have got something for you.
oh, that is quite all right. no charge.
and i thought we were getting on so well.
we were, we are, but this is perfect for you.
not interested.
are you under the impression that now I am in some way obligated to you?
well, no...but...
good. I will call the concierge. they can get you a new room, book your flight home, so forth.
for god's sake.
I am sorry. this just means so much to me.
the empress death mask.
the most important piece of chinese art outside of china.
somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
that old pirate chiang kai shek personally took this to taiwan when he was run out of china in 1949. peking would dearly love to have this back...
i suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
it is not for sale.
i know.
so you have heard all those stories about me. well, i can assure you they are not true. and if they were true, I have retired.
but roki said--
roki has a vivid imagination.
besides, if i lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which i do not--i would not need a partner, much less a callow girl. I would do it myself.
you can't.
oh?
it is only on exhibit at the queen's museum this month. even if you could get into the museum, the mask bas its own security system. a special, randomly programmed interval code.
we going somewhere?
possibly.
maybe i should drive this time.
maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
very nice.
not a word.
you want me to pick up a painting?
quite a good one. a monet. not major, but it is giverney.
I am not here to run errands. I am here for the mask.
if i can not trust you to pick up a painting, how can i trust you about the mask?
it is a test.
that is my girl.
fine. what do i do?
it is simple. you pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
how much am i paying?
I am paying...one point five million and change. i hate round numbers.
it is a fake.
give him the card.
but--
can you follow simple directions?
I am telling you it is a forgery. the paint's still wet for god's sake.
look on the back. what do you see?
a film case.
that is what you are buying. put it in your pocket.
he says they turned the card down.
damn, i knew i forgot something.
not funny.
what the hell do i do now?
up to you. you could tell him the check is in the mail.
what the hell was that?
not bad. i did not expect you to make it out.
you what--?
motorcycle.
got it.
it is one way.
we are only going one way.
we are going to die, are not we...
I am not the one to ask...
what about your bags?
i never carry...baggage.
those are my clothes.
certainly not mine. come on.
you stole my luggage? you--
I am a thief. sue me.
where is my bag?
that is entrapment.
no. entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
i do not believe this.
what is your problem? I am doing the job.
what is my problem? you want a list?
you really do not believe I would take on a partner after all these years without a little...insurance?
lose something?
I am just curious what sort of security system you would have in your own house.
and--
I am impressed. can not spot a thing.
hmmm. I would be surprised if you could.
nothing? you do not even lock the door?
i guess i have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?
my job, my rules. we have got a job to do. no mixing business and pleasure.
you are late.
i'm dressed.
and good morning.
good morning.
nice spot.
it is.  coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. we will start in twenty minutes.
i know it well.
as i recall, you have robbed it before.
years ago, if memory serves. when does the exhibit end?
in a week.
only a week?
they are having a farewell party the last night. before the mask goes back to taiwan.
that is when we will do it. and we will need every single day.
so the duke dug a tunnel--just in case. they made the lake a hundred years later. flooded the tunnel.
we go underwater?
we? are you implying that I am taking you inside?
we are doing this together. we are partners.
precisely. you give me the mask security code, i steal the mask, you get a finders fee. at ten percent, should be two or three million at least. not too bad.
i go in alone.
you do not get the mask code unless i go.
pack up. I will see you get back to london.
look, i can help. you need a sensor expert. you have got one.
this is not some picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room.
you do not have any idea how lucky you are!
a lifelong problem, I am afraid.
no, dammit! i mean me! that rembrandt...that rembrandt!
nice try. everyone thinks i did.
that is because i wanted them to!
i wondered who would been giving me a bad name.
i drilled the bolts and went in through the window. it was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
true enough.
you need a partner for this job. you will never find one as good as me.
the rembrandt--that was quite good.
it was perfect.
someone was expecting that.
you are too easily impressed with yourself. i believe I have made that point before.
I will need that.
no one needs anything except food and shelter. the rest we just want.
this is not a good time to hear your personal philosophy.
do not worry, i can get rid of this. no trace. and I will even go fifty fifty, we are partners are not we?
no. it is a down payment.
on what? another job?
we get the mask I will tell you.
a partner with secrets is not much of a partner.
without the mask it does not matter.
so the mask is part of the down payment too. must be a really big job.
let's just see how we do.
so you are testing me now?
oh, i think you can do it. probably.
why do not we take oxygen?
we are...for the tools.
let's do it again.
try laps. say a hundred.
I am not real big on collecting banged up ferraris at airports.
next time I will use valet parking.
they work off the o2 tank just like the slice pack.
which is--
in the van.
tina was a wonderful woman.
do not go getting sentimental. you are no damn good at it.
I would give you a hand but it would not look good.
yeah, the lord of the manor does not haul his own groceries.
and you do it so well.
the porta power...comm kits...got the ir/thermo camera?
had to get a liquid plasma screen.
the key to success is using the right tools.
you are not the one trying to get all this shit. you think they have just got a crooks r us on every corner?
we are going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. the air filters might be wired. and a bypass hose for the ac.
sure would not want you to be uncomfortable.
if we do not bypass it, the temperature in the mask room will change and set off the alarm. that would be inconvenient.
inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
you are a miracle worker.
we might not want to cash in our chips just yet. she has another job after this one. a big one.
this is big enough.
it is never big enough.
let me ask you, this mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
it is a death mask. death mask means dead.
right.
because i never assume anything.
i need you to get one more thing for me. a dress, elegant but sexy, something grace kelly would wear. maybe a balenciaga.
that is it, i sure as hell am not no personal shopper.
black of course.
I would say she is a size 6 who wears a size 4.
this better be worth 1t.
oh, it is.
it better be worth it for me.
did i hear a car?
our equipment has arrived.
hmmm.
all this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
it was a long time ago.
i did not mean to get personal.
yes you did.
so how long to pop the floor?
twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
and you have checked the ram to be sure it is synchronized with the clock.
a dozen times.
the lipstick thermal camera?
got it.
charged?
charged. receiver?
that is it. we are ready.
one more item--not on the check list.
i trust it is your size.
it's---beautiful.
you bought this for me?
do not get any ideas. of course it comes out of your share.
thank you.
thank you.
no, no, i want to. I will just go into the village.
it is not a village. there is nothing there.
will not take any time.
straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. do not blink, you will miss it.
you do not call, you do not write.
this was my first excuse to get away. i can not exactly use my cell phone.
yeah yeah yeah. what is the status?
we are getting close.
how close?
i do not know, but close.
this is dangerous. I am sending backup.
you, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
do not overestimate yourself.
look, trust me. i know what I am doing.
where are you at least?
I will send you a postcard. got to go.
certainly the most beautiful crook I have ever seen.
I have got something for you.
are not we early?
little celebration before we set off.
to us. to the mask.
to our...partnership.
you are nervous again.
when i was a girl my father took me to the edge of el capitan. three thousand feet of granite. straight down. i was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. i could not talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
you were afraid of heights?
terrified. still am.
how in the devil did you do the rembrandt then?
i had a lifeline. if I have got a lifeline, I am okay.
are not we all.
my father told me not to be afraid. he would always be there for me.
he wasn't.
so you had to be your own lifeline.
something like that.
and--
he pulled back his arms and blam, i landed right on the floor. i picked myself up, tears in my eyes, and he looked at me and he said, son, do not ever trust anybody. anybody.
camera in the--
bookshelf. sensors--
popup, on floorboards. and--
in eye of that painting.
we are working.
it is a party.
let's mingle a little, shall we?
i said a masked ball, not a costume party.
how the hell I am supposed to know the damn difference?
you look like george washington.
i cannot tell you a goddamned lie. she is selling you a pig in a poke. we better do this tonight.
it is too soon.
the early bird gets the damn worm.
but the second mouse gets the cheese.
so patience, thibeau, patience. trust me.
remind me why.
because it pays off.
you two make quite a couple.
we are supposed to.
you better not be taking on a new partner.
suspicious, after all these years?
you change partners, you change the rules.
oh, look at me, darling. i thought this gentleman was a waiter.
you damn well thought wrong.
I am terribly sorry old man.
one, two, three...
you are not on the beat.
do not turn. I am counting the steps to the entrance.
these rooms are solid stone. they have not changed.
you can not be too careful.
yes, you can.  you can spoil a perfectly nice dance.
ready?
ready.
can you see the other pirs?
got it.
they moved it.
behind you.
be careful not to break the laser beams.
duh.
careful...careful.
shut up.
we did it.
the mask.
now's when you tell me who you really are.
what?
you are playing both sides of the street. you are going to keep the mask and turn me in.
no, no, please god, you are wrong. I am a thief. just like you.
okay, you are a thief.
yes. yes.
what do i need a thief for? I have got the mask.
stop! you are making...mistake.
it is your mistake.
the big job.
there is no big job.
what?
a billion dollars.
your share.
get the hell in.
we are living history here.
you do not know the half of it.
i like banks.  that is where the money is.
speaking of money. you said billions. how many?
if you want a partner, i think you should recalculate the split.
okay, 80-20--
no, really, it is your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
my eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
it is fifty-fifty, less the cost of the dress.
come on, what can you do with six billion you can not do with four?
hold the record. alone.
hmmm...44 long.
i always knew you would do the job.
you have got everything planned.
everything.
I will need the rembrandt now.
sure, it is only worth 25 million or so, do not bother telling me what you are going to do with it.
i told you. it is the down payment. and thanks to you it is overdue.
insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
okay, look, I am delivering this to a man who is going to give us the key to our job. but it is pointless to try to explain it yet. you just have to trust me. i do not have any more secrets.
everyone has secrets, it is what makes us human.
idle hands, the devil's workshop.
there is food in the fridge. i will not be long.
a true master. classic, yet extremely sexual, do not you think?
we need to make the trade tomorrow.
always in a rush.
you should know, when i come back here with the mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you have done goes to the prc.
gin, really.
tomorrow. it has to be tomorrow. or forget the mask.
tonight your league night?
check out my ball.
does not look like much. how come those commos want it so bad?
it is not just art, it is history. something you americans do not care about--because you have not got any.
that is because we live in the future. which is what is on my mind.
this is just show and tell.
I am waiting for the tell part.
she is calling the shots now.
you are impressed with her, are not you?
she is good. give her that. almost as good as she thinks she is.
she reminds you of yourself. there is nobody you admire more.
my antenna is up, it is fully extended, and i am picking up...what is it? it is, can it be? the boy is in el, u, v.
it is never happened before. what makes you think it is happening now?
you better be keeping your mind on business. it is not just me you got to worry about. I have got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
you know where my loyalties lie.
to yourself, that is where.
you will just have to have faith.
faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. i got to have trust.
she will not tell me everything. it is a bank job, that is all i know.
thirty-five next generation microchips. copper, not silicon. value: one million each.
you are giving them to me?
call it an expression of trust.
thought you had to use some of these.
you do not really think I would leave ten million dollars worth of our chips in her bag?  what matters is not what is real. it is what we think is real--what matters is the art.
take this mask. it may look like the empress, but it is not.
i figured that out.
the face decays, the mask doesn't. art lasts, we don't. that is why art's so valuable. it is a little piece of immortality.
you got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
i really do not think that is a topic on which you have much to offer.
did i ever tell you what tina wrote? the night she died?
my friend, you always surprise me.
we wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? and they do not come off. but when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
the mask. where is it?
you took the rembrandt, i figured it was a fair trade.
do you know what you have done!? do you know?
would you quiet down! just for a minute?
oh my god, i thought--
I would taken the mask?
what about the rules?
my job, my rules.
gin? where the hell are you?
I am in the middle.
in the middle? you have got the mask, why do not we have him?
he is on to something bigger.
listen to me. whatever you are doing, stop. pull out.
too late now.
tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so i can trace you.
I am going to get him, i promise you.
well...what are we doing?
you are being useless. I am making us rich.
currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
transfer.
the eight billion. from them to us.
right. the eight billion.
what is that?
guest lists of every a-list party on turnover night. they would be handy to disappear into, so we are invited to all of them.
peoples china bank.
where the money is.
it is taken me five years at webber insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this cd. it has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. total, eight billion and change.
and the money goes--
every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. as soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it is shot somewhere else. it ends up so clean the mafia could not find it.
but those instructions, they are recorded in the computer.
nope. the cd instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded xj-6.
a parting gift from the empire.
sit down, I will show you how we are going to do it.
the oscilloscope's already programmed.
it is no good without the argon gas.
got it.
then the vault, how to get in the vault, that is stumping me.
that is where the mask comes in.
you have thought of everything.
so how long till we do this?
we are doing it tonight.
you can not be serious.
that is the beauty of it. there is only one tiny window of time when this will work. at the handover of hong kong--from britain to china. the handover from them to us.
you are out of your mind. we can not do a job like this with no rehearsal.
there is no way to practice this. and no time. besides, I have planned it all. there are not any surprises.
there is always a surprise.
I have covered everything. and you are the best, so--
you are overestimating yourself again. what is worse, this time you are overestimating me.
look, there is a video security system to bypass, that is the only hard part. you have done that a dozen times.
for god's sake, the only way i can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
feeling old?
how do i look?
like a woman of mystery.
access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...
can not be too careful.
two men in the world do not need passwords or codes. their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
let me guess. his retinal plate is in there.
pulse detectors.
charged.
parachute.
packed.
done.  and i assume you have the magic cd- rom?
surgically attached.
no way to take another day or two?
no. you will see when we get inside.
you should not have.
can not break tradition. it is bad luck.
there is one more thing.
you have something in mind?
call it a new tradition.
that was a lifetime ago.
it was wrong to deceive you.
but that is all behind us now.
but would you--would you--
have really held you under?
of course not. it was just a negotiating ploy.
nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
I am sorry.
so what are you going to do with your share?
oh, i do not care about the money.
four billion dollars.
seen one billion, seen them all.
that is because you grew up rich.
a flaw in your research, my dear. i grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.
not for me.
what? another job? stealing the eiffel tower?
I am going to disappear. i die in a car crash in taiwan. very easy to do.
they drive so recklessly there.
I am leaving from the nathan road station at 6:30 tomorrow morning. you could come too.
the sign of our partnership.
brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
and when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction xj6 was really about...
china will think it happened before midnight. britain will swear it happened after midnight...
they will each be positive the other guy did it.  i fear an ugly international incident.
jesus god, it is going through.
hong kong midnight, happy new year. except at china bank.
relax, do not jam it...
fucking thing!!!
do not panic, now, there is no rush...
we can not leave it in there, it is got all our accounts, everything that can nail us to a goddam cross!!!
move it, what are you waiting f...
the disc is still in there.
we can not help it, we...we've gotta...
the door's the only way out!
i sincerely hope not.
jesus.
you can do it.
come on.
no way.
go!
hang on.
get out of here!
i cannot get rid of you.
no, you can't.
put this on!
I am not leaving without you.
what is wrong.
nothing is wrong. everything is the way it has to be. in my left coat pocket is a packet. passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
take the airport subway, but change at jordan station for kowloon tong.
but--
it is only ninety seconds up the line. you are on a connection to a trans siberian express.
what about you?
you have the right to remain silent. but anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you--
my god--
--you're a cop.
both sides of the street, I am afraid.
he looks familiar.
that would be thibadeaux. the cop i work for every now and then. catching thieves. the really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
they have been on to you all along. knew you had a big job going.
you gave them the eight billion.
you mean the seven billion.
takes a lot out of you, one like this.
yes it does.
i been meaning to tell you, far as I am concerned you are over the hill.
see you.
probably not.
yeah. probably not.
