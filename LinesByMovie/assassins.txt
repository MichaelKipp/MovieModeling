how much farther?
just a little ways.  up to those trees.
hey, do you mind if i talk a little?  i feel like, i do not know, talking i guess.
sure.
funny, I have never been a talker. my wife was always getting on me about that.  'say what you feel, tell me what is bothering you, you ve got to talk to me.'  i never would though.  not really.
why not?
i do not know.  part of me wanted to but part of me always said, 'what's she going to be able to do?'  i do not know.  maybe i did not trust her.
i think I have heard of you.
it is possible.
you are pretty famous are not you?
i hope not.
i know this may seem like a strange question, but can i ask you how much the contract was for -- not to insult you or anything, i know you are a professional, but just for me, i was just wondering.
it is a common question.
oh yeah?  i guess we still need to see that price tag.  like art, right?  you hang some painting that looks like baby-puke in your living room only if it costs a bundle.
a dime.
one hundred thousand?  that is it? jesus... is that a lot?
average.
shit... oh well.
i have been thinking about this for a long while.  i knew this day was coming.  i knew someday someone would make the call on me. i never thought about anyone that i had whacked.  what do you call it anyway?
taken.
'taken.'  that is nice.  when i had someone taken i would call our general contractor, transfer the money and as soon as i hung up the phone i forgot about them.
everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
that is exactly what i told myself.
do not know.  that is how it works.
that is what our general contractor told us but how can you trust someone like that?
right.
i thought that i would be thinking about margaret, or work, or that I would be having these deep, profound and depressing thoughts but I am not.  I am trying to think really profound thoughts, but i can't. it seems very funny to me.
what are you thinking about?
I am thinking about moonpies.  am not that funny?  i have not had a moonpie since i was ten years old. right now, I am thinking how much I would love one.
and an r.c.
can i ask you something?
go ahead.
what do other guys do?
everyone handles it differently. some are ready, some are not.
do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
some.
when i thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  it would not go away and it would really upset me. it was something that i could never get away from... but now, i feel it is okay.  i feel good.
can i ask you a question?
anything.
why did not you fade?
you mean quit?
yeah.
i used to think about it.  i had margaret.  she wanted kids.  i thought about moving somewhere far away like, europe.  i could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but i could not see that next part.  'then what?' so I would stop thinking about it and go back to work.  you understand?
yeah.
look at that.  i have not watched the sun set in a million years. do you mind?
no.
hi.  did you call --
yes.  please come in.
i prefer it like this.
how can a beautiful man like you be shy?
would you like a drink?
I would love one.  whatever you are having.
why are you working today?
holidays are our busiest days.  no one likes to be alone on holidays. i know i don't.
you are very good at this are not you?
i think you are supposed to answer that question.
that is okay, hon, i always expect the unexpected.
i called because i just want... i need to talk.
for what?
honesty.
do you ever regret things you have done?
everyone regrets something.
but when you finlsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
sometimes.
do you think about their wives or their families?
no.  they call me, i do not call them.  if they did not call i would not exist.
do you ever think about starting over?
all the time.
can you tell me about it?
then, I will sail alone.
do you believe that?
are you asking me if i believe in another life?
is that all you want?
yes.
thank you.
anytime.
where have you been, robert?
sick.  the flu.
i do not believe you.
i have been sitting on a contract from cleveland for six days because of you.
fuck you, fuck cleveland, and fuck your contracts --
send the file.  I will have the estimate tonight.
I am worried about you, robert.
what?
the contract was stolen.
who?
a new player.  he is using the name nicholai.
is there a problem?
no.  no problem.  the airport, right?
right.
yeah.  yeah, I am a waiter.
where?
what?
what restaurant?
uh, fontella's
so you are from around here?
no.  no I am not.
where you from?
what is this?
not too good at small talk, eh?
look, I am real tired and I am not interested in fucking chit-chat.
i know just what you mean.  I am pretty beat myself.
why?  what happened?
did not you here all them sirens? it is been all over the radio.  some guy shot leevio valli, and a bunch of bystanders, in the trattoria roma.
no shit.
yeah, it is terrible.  i mean valli, and i do not care what office he is running for, the guy's a crook.  he probably had it coming, but all the other people.  real sad.
yeah.
but they caught the guy.  i heard it all.  sounded like he just went berserk, fucking loco.  shooting anybody.  drugs, probably.
probably.
I would love to sit in that jury.  send that s.o.b. right to the chair.
what are you doing?
what?
that was peterson back there.  that goes to the expressway for the airport.
you are right.  talking too much again.
yeah well, you just blew your tip, pal.
what?  you think I am running you up?
just do your job.
what are you doing?
get out.  you think I am running you up?  get out.
you can not --
the hell i can't.  it is my cab.  i do not like you.  so, get the hell out!
sit back.  put your seatbelt on.
no fucking way.
okay, don't.
boy, that is fucking genius.  you are a fucking genius.  then you are just sitting there, bullshitting with me. man, no way i coulda done that!
what is your name?  we both know it is not nicholai.
holy shit!  robert rath wants to know my name.
bain.  michael bain.
how long have you been freelance?
two years.  two long fucking years.
hey.  what i do not get was why did not you take the shot inside the restaurant?  i mean you had me, a free shot.  that is what i would have done.
it is just a shoot-out then.  sixty- forty, at best.  not my odds.
sounds like chickenshit --
you do not have to tell me that. it is just, i know my bid was low, but was it too low?  i mean, did i seem like an amateur, like i did not know what i was doing?
we both know what you were doing.
oh!  i got a question.  jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit, listen to me.  i sound like some fucking fanboy.  I am sorry, but i just got to ask you.  everybody talks about how you left the agency and got into the business and then how you went after the russian, nicholai talinkov --
tachlinkov.
yeah, that is it.  and he is like a fucking genius.  they said he shaded you over and over.  and in the end, he aced you again.  shaded and faded.  they say he is living on some greek island, but i say that is fucking bullshit.  i say you are the best and that you planted his ass. am i right?
robert bain, driving me!  jesus fucking christ!
after those cops, you will never be able to come back to cleveland.
who the fuck cares about cleveland. cleveland blows.  what kind of marks have they got here?  greasy mobster, teamster or some hand job politician.  i want the money marks. i want the marks that you get.
so what happens now?
we go around once.
bullshit.
okay.
what?  what is okay?
what are you doing?
there is a sand barricade up ahead; I am going to ram this cab into it. the cab has an airbag, odds are good I will survive.  but with this steel casing and bullet proof glass, odds for you are not so good.
no, no.  wait.  you do not want me to jump.  you are going to jump.  I am stuck back here until it is too late. wham -- over!
i know you are going to jump.
i was not watching television.
the point is, they are paying for information.  real information.  not tooth paste brands.  not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper.  and no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. you are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
i thought it was interesting --
god damnit, electra.  this is not a game.  this is business.
right.  in my hands i have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
jesus!  why did not you tell me?
I will make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
electra --
a pleasure doing business with you.
i know what happened.
i bet you fucking know!
it cost us.
i give a fuck?  I am done!  i quit! do you fucking hear me!  I am fucking gone!
he stole another contract.
is this how it went, nick?
robert?  robert?
how did he know?
know what?
the fucking contract!  how in the fuck did he know.
i do not know what the fuck you are.
i know.  it was a joke.
you think this is a fucking joke?
$1,000,000.
deadline?
tomorrow.  the buyer is japanese. his retirement a condition of the bonus.
who is the mark?
freelancer.  a woman.  surveillance specialist.
a player?
we have an m.o... her system is protected by her 'pussy virus.'
hi.  up ahead my boss is in that black limo.  we are not sure which hotel we are at, so could you just follow them?
sure.
what?
he has to clean up.  how many bodies were there?
um, five.
one hour per man.
get on the expressway.
where are we going?
nikita?  she helped me find you.
what?  how did you know i had a cat?
took a guess.  lucky for you, i guessed right.
who the fuck are you?  who do you work for?
i work for the government.
yeah?
bullshit.
yeah.
you are one of them, are not you?  a fucking pro.
I am part of the game, just like you.
twenty large?  that is all?
what do you mean, 'that's all'? what in the hell do you know?
the bonus on the contract for you was one million dollars.
i figure that means these are worth ten times that, maybe more.
ten million --
now you understand why I am here.
now what?
turn off the engine.
you want me to pump?
no, stay in the car.  i want you to understand something.  if i intended to kill you, you would already be dead.
okay.  how did you find me?
you are the computer hacker, you tell me.
you did not know anything about me.
nikita?
yellow pages.  v for veterinarian. there are not that many.
you are one of them, are not you?
'them'?
an assassin?
until a minute ago.
what does that mean?
if i still was what i used to be, you would not be pointing that at me.
who is that other guy?
another contractor.
someone hired both of you?
no.  they hired bain.  the contract would have been mine, but bain took it from me as he took the previous one.
so this is something between you and him?
he stole the contract knowing that i would come after him.
why?
because he is trying to retire me.
he wants to kill you?
yes.
why?
the nature of the business.  you remove your competition.
and you want to use me to get him?
yes.
forget it!
we do not have a choice.
do not tell me i do not have a choice!
right.
I am two seconds away from making my choice which means you have got two seconds to tell me why i should not shoot you.
it is simple.  you need me.  i need you.  and we will both need money.
i do not need you to get the money -- my money!
if it had not been for me, you would be dead.
i do not need the money.
this is something that is never going to end.  you can never work in the business again with this contract, because he will find you. to survive, you have to go into deep hiding.  and that is going to take money, a lot of money.
then you can have the disks and I will just walk out that door --
if you walk out that door, bain will still come after you.
why?
because he took a contract on you. he will come for you and he will find you.
you do not know that -- you are trying to scare me.
no.  it is the truth.  i know what you are.  like me, like bain, you are a ghost, you are not part of the real world.  you do not have a social security number.  you do not pay taxes.  you have probably used ten different names over the last ten years.  a long time ago something probably happened, something illegal and you ran, you disappeared and it was easy.  you think you can do it again.  but I am telling you, fading from the law is nothing.  no matter what you do, where you go, i swear to you that bain will find you.
how?
right now, as we sit here, he is tearing through your apartment.  he is digging through your drawers, emptying your closets.  he will take your telephone and address books, your appointment books.  if you keep a diary, he is reading it.  he will go into the kitchen and find out what kind of food you eat, liquor you drink, cigarettes you smoke.  in the bathroom he will find any prescription drugs you take and where you get them filled.  if you have video tape or recordings he will watch and listen to all of them.
oh jesus jesus...
he will know everything about you. everything.  i know, because I have done it.  once you have been inside a mark's home, you are in their head. if you are any good, you will find the mark in a week, and bain is good because i was the best and i could not take him.
listen -- i do not even know your name.
rath.  robert rath.
electra.
just electra?
yeah.
as in daughter of agamemnon?
no.  just electra.
what I am trying to say is that -- I am not sure i can do this, help you, unless i know more about you.
what do you want to know?
if bain had not taken the contract on me, would you have?
no.
why?
because I am done.
this is crazy.  i can not trust you. you can not trust me.  how can we possibly help each other?
with computers.
it is not the same, is it?
better than playing with yourself.
had?
he was russian.  nicholai tachlinkov.  a legend in the business when i was just starting. i admired him.  when i heard he loved chess i became obsessed with the game.
it looks like white's game.
we played with a code using the new york times obituaries.  over three years we played twelve matches.  i never won.
why did not you finish this game?
he was... taken.
he was killed.
i killed him.
why?
because that is how it works.  that is what it is about.  he was the best. he was on top.
where you wanted to be?
yes.  as soon as you get into this business, all you can think about is getting to the top.  that is all there is.  until then, there is nothing.  you are nothing.
how did you get into the business?
the same way everyone does; the government, the agency.
the c.i.a.?
more or less.
how old were you?
they recruited me when i was in high school.
jesus -- why?
languages.  i was already fluent in nine languages.
you were like a boy genius?
some people said that.  i never thought so.
why not?
i was just different.
you went from high school to the agency?
no.  i graduated from george washington university.  then i entered the agency training program.
they did not give you a choice, did they?
no, they didn't.
but you knew what they were training you for?
of course.  i was going to be james bond.
ahhhh...
they are very good at what they do. it is very seductive.  the training, the weapons, the travel --
the exotic women.
women?  no... not really.
why not?
women... i don't... i do not want to talk about women.
why?
because you are a women.
why did you leave the agency?
the same reason everyone does.  you hear your name on c-span and you realize you are a skeleton in someone is closet and they are coming to bury you.
they tried to kill you?
yes.  it did not matter much to them as long as i disappeared.
then you went freelance?
the only thing different about the private sector is that a general contractor takes less of a percentage than the government, so you make more money.  then once you make the transition, you realize you were never working for the government; it was always the private sector, the vested interests and it is the same vested interests that continue to buy your plane tickets.
tell me about the first time.
my first take?
yes.
why?
because i want to know.
it was... mechanical.  very precise. it was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
are they usually like that?
no.  just the first one.
after that?
they become complicated... messy.
did it ever bother you?
did it ever bother james bond?
that is fiction.
this is fiction!  do not you see that?  this is another reality.  and the people that come into the world to play this game -- nobody forces them!  they are here, they know the rules, the stakes, the risks!  do you understand what i am saying?  no one is innocent -- including you!
does that mean it did not bother you?
is that what you wanted to hear? something cold blooded... something remorseless...
no.  something honest.
I am on the scent.
you are too late.
michael?
no.  no.  no.  i do not believe it.
they money will be standard bank transfer.  we believe we will know where and when.
what?
such language in front of a lady.
i do not give a fuck what you are.  i asked you --
how in the fuck do you know that?
do you want rath or not?
it.  tell it.  for all i know it could be a machine.
you said you did not trust it.
i don't.
do you have a passport?
several.
good.
where is it?
mexico.
hey, where are you?
thinking.
about?
nothing.
I have never been to the gulf of mexico.  is it as nice as they say?
i do not know.
you were there?
good afternoon.  we have reservations at the hotel paraiso in costa blanca.
yes, sir.
no, no.  i said the hotel paraiso.
yes.  this is the hotel paraiso.
no, the other hotel paraiso, in the city.  near the plaza del sol.
I am sorry, sir.  a year ago there was a fire in the old hotel paraiso. this is the new hotel paraiso.
take us there.
that is where he will be.
what?
i was not expecting this.  i need to think.
no.
why not?
it helps me to focus.  it centers me, helps me think.
oh.  what do you think about?
work.  the things i need to get done.
do you think about the game?
yes.
but you have never figured out a way to win.
no.
not even a stalemate?
no.
what happens if you do?
what will you do if this works, if we get the money?
i do not know... maybe I will live on a boat, sail to all the places I have never been.
that sounds nice.
I am kind of tired.  i think I would like to try and get some sleep.
you can have the bed.  the chair is fine for me.
do you think he is here?
here?
in costa blanca.
yes.
what do you think he is doing?
i do not know... but I am sure he is not sleeping.
breakfast.
why do not you bring it out here? it is beautiful out here.
i know what you are thinking.  I am not going to disappear, okay?  I am not going anywhere, just down there, to that beautiful beach.  i got to get out of this room, just for a little while.
okay.
really?
he will not be looking for you.  just be careful.  buy a book.  keep your sunglasses on.
book.  sunglasses.  great.
you should knock.
sorry.
how was the beach?
the beach?  it was nice.
where did you learn it?
taiwan.
not that i would know, but you look like you are really good at it.
thank you.
I have always wanted to learn something like that.
you should.  it is very important, that the body release the energy that builds in it.
hello, robert.
the contract?
paid in full.
two way?
transmits and receives.
cheap as shit.
i paid a lot for these.
they saw you coming a mile away.  if i had known we would be using --
it is too late now.  okay?  we will have to deal with these.
fine.
this is the bank.  this is the hotel.  in the morning i will enter the bank.
check.
he will be hidden somewhere out here, probably somewhere low, in the crowd.  he will stay there until he sees me enter the bank.
but he will not shoot you right then?
no.  it would be amateur.  a risk. he will wait for the prime shot, that he knows is coming.  once I am inside, he will move to the hotel. he will go up the back, too much traffic in the front.
you will be here.  a restaurant.  a public place far enough away that he will not notice you, but with a good enough view you will be able to see him when he moves inside.
okay.  then what?
then, we wait.
aiiee.  more waiting?  i do not know if i like this plan.
it will take the entire day, but he will begin to doubt himself.  he will begin to believe that he missed me, that somehow i slipped by and am already on a plane to europe.
the sun will be low, almost dark, the air cool and the bank will almost be closed.  5:45.  5:50.  he will put the rifle down, he will get up and he will walk across the plaza to the bank.
why will not he wait until the bank closes?
he will not be able to.  he will have to go inside.  he will have to see with his own eyes, whether or not i am there.  if the bank closes, he will not know for sure.  he will come.  I am sure.  and when he does you will go into the hotel, go upstairs and take the gun.
what?  what if he brings it with him?
he can't.  the bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and x-ray machines.
that means you will not have a gun.
that is right.
and with the mikes, I will tell you when he leaves the hotel and you will tell me when he leaves the bank.
if things go well, i do not have to. you will already be in a rented car waiting for me.
you will have the money.  how do i know that you will not --
I will be walking out of the bank, unarmed.  you will have the gun and I will drive the car.
we split the money?
five million apiece.  you get on your plane, i get on mine.
sounds pretty well figured out.
I have been thinking about it for a long time.
except --
what?
except, if he does not come out of the hotel.
i told you, he will.
you can not know for sure, how can you?  i mean, you are not him.
i was.
ten years ago, i sat there in that same hotel window, sweat pouring off of me waiting --
for nicholai?
yes.
you killed him here?  in this city, outside that bank?
what is it?  i do not like this at all.  what is going on here?
i do not know.  it just happened.  i was here ten years ago, I am here now.  that is it.
i do not believe that.
it was not planned or premeditated. i swear.  things happened beyond my control.  i understood; i saw where they were leading and i suppose that it just made sense.
ten years ago.
yes.
what happened?
i waited until i was insane and then i walked into the bank.  he was sitting there, very calm, waiting for me.
what did he want?
he wanted what i want now; to get out of the business.  to disappear to some empty greek island.
what did he say?
he said i could not win.  that no one wins at this game.
was that it?
then he offered me one million dollars to walk away, to quit the business.
you did not take it.
no.  i went back to the hotel.  and waited.
ten years later, here you are again.
yes.  here i am again.
do you have ulcers?
no.
i think i got one today.
five million dollars will buy a lot of rolaids.
why did you trade a bishop for a knight?
i hate bishops.  they are useless.  i like knights.
they are worth less points.
so?
did you think they were newlyweds?
i did not notice them.
when i first saw them i thought they were married.
how do you know they are not?
i went into their room this afternoon.
what?
it was no big deal.  i saw them leave, i went in.
jesus, if someone had --
nobody ever sees me.
why in the hell would you take that chance?
i heard them last night and it made me want to know something about them.  i wanted to, so i did.
she is married, but not to him. another man, much older.  she has four kids.  the young guy works for her.  and i think she likes kinky sex.
thank you.
is not it interesting though?  i mean, look at us, in this room.  or yesterday, when we were walking in the plaza market.  i mean, we look like just another couple.  but what are we?  does not it seem so crazy?
no.
no?
it is always been that way.  the world has always functioned on two levels.
i know.  it makes me crazy.
why?
i do not know.  when i was in college, i was forced to go to a psychiatrist because i was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
and you were drilling these holes...?
so i could watch the girl that lived under me.
apparently this doctor was unable to cure you.
he told me that my curiosity became unnaturally entangled with my sense of self-preservation.
did he explain how this happened?
he believed it all went back to one night, when as a little girl.  i watched my parents have this big fight, really big.  i thought my mother was going to kill my father. then they went into their room and made up.  and i watched them make love through the keyhole.
what are you doing?
what?
that is a ridiculous move.
why?
because, I will take it.
I am playing white, remember.  you can not tell me which pieces to move. it does not work that way.
can i ask you something?
I am sure you will.
am i attractive?
yes.
are you attracted to me?
yes.
why?
why?  i do not know.
is it a physical thing, or a mental thing?
both.
is that why you did not want to talk about women before?
i did not want to complicate the situation.
attraction is a complication?
it can be.
it happened to you before?
yes.
who was she?
someone like me, like you.  a pro.
what happened to her?
she was taken.
did you --
no.  i tried to stop it.  i couldn't.
was she the only one?
after her, i realized that to survive i had to live without... it is dangerous to let things become complicated.
is this becoming complicated?
I am not sure that i care anymore.
were you attracted to me right away?
no.
when did it start?
honestly?
uh-huh.
when i gave you my gun and you almost shot me.
maybe you should see a psychiatrist.
why?
that does not sound normal.
I am not normal.
i know.  that is why I am attracted to you.  i mean, you make me nervous. you are intimidating.  maybe it is my curiosity/self-preservation thing, but all i can really think about right now is kissing you.
martin.
martin.
you wish to close this account today?
that is correct.
how would you like the funds?
american currency.
this will take some time.
i have all day.
excellent, senor.  if you could follow me?
I am sorry, but i am waiting for an associate.  can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
of course, senor.
thank you.
four minutes.
what?
i waited another four minutes.
shit.
wait until he is on the stairs.
right.
I am taking off my mike.
okay.
electra --
what?
last night --
was nice.
yes.
how did you know?  just tell me that. how did you fucking know?
i knew the same way in ten years you are going to know.
what does that fucking mean?
it means that I am going to tell you things, even though i already know that you are not going to listen to a god damned thing i say.
listen to me, bain.  two days ago, you contacted your contractor, who told you that they knew when and where i was going to pick up the transferred money from microcell. you do not know how they got the information.  it bothered you, but you did not care.  how do i know this?  because ten years ago, i was sitting in that chair, as scared shitless as you are now.
i am not scared of you.
yeah you are and you hate it.  you hate the fact that your hand is shaking and mine isn't.  that you are sweating your balls off and I am not. you have got fear and hate in your belly like battery acid, all because of me.
if you think you can take me, quit fucking bullshitting and try it.
all right, bain.  pay attention, because this is where everything changes.
five million dollars?
that is right.
shit.  that sure is a lot of money.
did you see how i did that?  magic was not it?
what?
you understand what is going on?  it makes sense, right?
oh, yeah.
what i just said, no assassin would say.  what I have said, only a mark would say.
you think i would be an idiot to pass up five million dollars.
you would be.
you do not know a fucking thing about me.  you do not have the slightest fucking clue.
why do not you tell me.
I will tell you this.  after cleveland, i thought i was lucky to be alive.  but now, here, i just realized that you were the lucky one.
now I will tell you something.  it would not fucking matter if i offered you one hundred million dollars. you would still be thinking the same thing, that you are going to take me. and here i am, sitting through this, knowing it is bullshit, looking at you and the only thing going on in my mind, the only thing i can think is that, in just a few minutes I am going to take you.
he is coming, electra!  get out now!
oh, god.  i see it!
game over, bitch!
bain!
