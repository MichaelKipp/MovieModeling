you know what i want to do?
yeah.
what do i want to do?
you want to fuck me. but you can't fuck me.
why?
because, you know why. you know.
because your a virgin?
because i'm a virgin and i don't want no baby.
you think i want a baby? when you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
why is that?
because i like you. i think you're beautiful. i think if we fucked you would love it. you wouldn't even believe it.
i wouldn't believe it?
i don't know. i just think that you would love it.
but, i don't know. i'm just scared that things would change. between us.
what things? i'm telling you, nothing's going to change.  i want to make you happy. that's all.
you know it won't hurt. i'll be gentle. i promise.
do you care about me?
of course i do.
shit.
was up bitch?
what do you think?
you fucked it?
i knew you fucked it! i sat out here for like two hours! that girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
who am i? who am i? the mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
well, how was it?
oh my god, so good. that girl can fuck.
she can fuck?
hell yeah. that bitch was bleeding. when i first put it in she screamed real loud. i saw her bite down on the pillow.
oh shit. how long did it take?
did what take?
how long did you fuck her?
well it took me longer than i thought it would take. it took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. but once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. i had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. it hurts the first time.
yeah.
but then when she got into it. she really got into it. it was good.
how did she smell? did her puss stink?
oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
hell's yeah. she was so clean.
oh man, that's the best.
you could tell she took care of herself. she had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
let me smell it again.
you know what else?
what?
i can tell that she had just entered puberty.
how?
well, i was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
right.
and there was this picture of her painting easter eggs or something. and i said, you were cute when you were little.
yeah.
and she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. i look younger without my makeup.
and i looked at her, and thought to myself oh my god, this girl is a baby.
yeah.
and for a second i felt a little bit guilty. you know, because she's young and all. and then i was like, oh shit, that turns me on. i wanna fuck this little baby girl.
i'm telling you casper. i think i'm getting addicted to that shit.
to what? virgins?
yeah. it's like all i think about now. not just that, it's like lately during sex, i start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
what do you mean?
i mean i'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
you mean like fucking two virgins at once.
that would be good. but i mean more like. i don't know. like when i was having sex with her, i kept thinking how much i would like to put it in her ass. just to see what would happen.
she's probably smash you in the fucking face.
i don't know about that. she was pretty into it. but i wasn't gonna try. the whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. show 'em some respect.
did you tell her that you loved her?
like. like. never love. love is for low-level virgin seduction guys.
shit.
what do you want?
get another forty.  smoke a blunt.
are you hungry?
hell yeah. fuckin' starvin'. wait up a sec.
you wanna go to paul's house?
what for? that guys a dick.
i'm sure he's got food. he's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
you think he's got any herb?
i don't know, he quit dealin' but i'll bet he'll smoke us out.
you think?
probably.
he lives on 76th?
78th.
den less go joe.
telly.
yeah.
did she suck your dick?
a little bit. but i didn't really want her to.
why?
i don't know. that's too easy. i mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. that's so easy.
it is right.
i want to knock her guard down. i mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
it's no big deal, right?
right. but when you deflower a girl, that's it. you did it. you were the one. no one else can ever do it.
yeah. the way i see it. my outlook on the this situation is.  it's like getting fame, you know what i'm saying. it's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
yep.
they're gonna tell their grand kids.  that telly. he sure was good in the sack!
you thirsty?
yeah, i feel dehydrated.
you got any money?
three pennies and a ball of lint.
you down with the boost?
unzip my pack, yo.
uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?
whah?
diss digg. i'm curious if you have it?
whah is dissdee?
diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
i no understand you. maybe crazy.
i'll ask you one last time. do you have diss digg?
whah you say? dissdee?
you know like in "the wonder twins" they share everything.
the cartoon?
yeah. "the wonder twins". you know.  activate in the form of, a glass of water.
yeah.
well, those guys share everything, right?
right.
and once i saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. where they lived the other's life for a day. you know those guys share everything, right?
right.
and it got me thinkin'. how fun it would be to share each other's girl.
yeah, that would be fun but i don't like any of the girls you go out with. like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
no, i'm serious man. i'm dead ass. do you wanna try? we could be like the fuckin x-rated "wonder twins"!
can you do it man?
can i do it? i just broke her cherry. i imagine i can make her do anything. bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire.
hello?
it's me. telly.
hello?
paul it's telly. open up.
what are you guys doing?
nothing. we just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
you want a wip-it?
nah.
so, how many people live here now?
i don't know, eight or nine.
where does everyone sleep?
everywhere. fuckin' flophouse. we're still short on the rent. if you want, you and casper can move in. you guys can share the bathtub.
that girl you boned last year. remember?
man i haven't seen her in forever. what the fuck's she up to?
telly says was up.
i knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. that dick.
you still mad at him?
of course. how am i gonna forgive him after what he did?!
first times are always wacked. just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
that shit is nothin'. i remember, i had just turned 14. with this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. i don't even remember his name. i think it was john or jake or something. i remember he had a brother named lentil because i would always joke and call him lentil bean. this was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
the pain. the fucking pain!
and you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
you are being ripped open.
i know.
did you bleed?
i didn't bleed.
you didn't?
no, i didn't bleed.
hell yeah. i love. i love sex.
foreplay. foreplay.
yep. that's the best way. it's that boom boom boom.
right. you know it's not like... you know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
yep.
making love is like.
sweet.
slow.
it's grandmother style.
yeah.
it's like...
you know what it's like. it's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
yeah.
its like. but it gets boring. it's boring.
it's really slow. it's slow boring.
yeah.
it's very monotonous.
yeah. and sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.
it's like yeah whatever. but when you fuck. you wanna fuck that person. you're like ripping each other's hair out. ooooh.
right. you're like it's just this instinct. it's like this animal instinct is taking over you. it's like...
passion...
boom!!! boom!!!
but that's the thing. girl's like it slow. they like romance. they like things to be sweet and romantic.
yep.
i mean i've been with a lot of girls i know.
yeah me too nigga.
you know... you know a lot of times sex gets in the way. has that ever happened to you?
yep.
you know. because sometimes the foreplay is just so good. and then when it actually comes time for sex. it's like the worst letdown.
yep, yep. but he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
hell yeah, they don't know.
like where are your erogenous zones?
mine?
mine are like my neck and my chest.
yeah. mine are my toes. oh my god if someone sucks my toes i'll come in like ten seconds!
yeah. it depends. cause like this one time with eric, when we got blasted at his house. and smash j and dj flipper was there...
oh shit.
and we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. and he just pulled me over to the bed. and they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to disco
right.
and we were like underneath the sheets. we were going at it like crazy. oh my god that shit was so good! it was like hard...
yeah.
he was like sucking my tits. he was fucking fingering me. but that shit was nice and hard.
i was like yes! i'm going out with him!
that's right. that's why foreplay is better than sex.
yep.
because he can like climax you up to that...
yep.
but then the sex gets into the way and you're like: what happened! what the hell happened?!
yeah it's the biggest disappointment!
yeah. and it takes them either too long or too short to come. have you ever had someone that took forever
to come?
yeah. i had sex with jake, and it took him like an hour and a half.
yeah. the shit gets wacked. fifteen minutes.
yeah. fifteen minutes to a half an hour. hard and deep.
me. i can only take it up to fifteen minutes. cause i get bored.
yeah i get bored.
i start thinking about what i'm gonna eat afterwards.
i hate this game.
no. casper's right. girls love it. they just act like they don't in front of their friends.
i hate sucking dick!
yeah. 'cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
and sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
yeah. and then it hits that little thing.  that little punch bag. what is it? the tonsils. the esophagus, whatever.
yeah. and you're not getting anything out of it.
and it's like. how much more can i bob here? you know.
and you don't get shit out of it.
have you ever swallowed it before?
it was... it was.
it's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
no, no, no. you can't get that taste out of your mouth. until you eat something.
yeah.
you can drink like there's no tomorrow but you still can't get that sperm between the teeth out. it's so disgusting.
that's the whole thing. you know if you look at it. i mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. and everyone's dying. and you better wear a condom or else. but the truth is. i don't know any kids with aids. no one i know has ever died from that shit. it's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
yep.
i've known the past of all the people i've fucked without a condom. like i know one of the people got tested and was negative.
yeah.
and i know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so i knew he was safe.
yeah.
and the other person i just fucked, which was a mistake. but i went to the clinic last week with jennie.
i made her get tested with me because i didn't want to go alone.
did they ask you a lot of questions?
how old you?
17.
how old are you?
15.
how many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
umm. altogether?
yes. altogether.
hmm. i'd say eight, maybe nine.
how many times have you gone unprotected?
with four of them, i didn't use any kind of protection. wait, maybe it was three.
how many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
one.
were you protected?
have you ever had anal intercourse?
yes.
with how many people?
umm. three i believe. but i'm not sure.
were they wearing condoms?
uh. yes. twice they weren't. two times they didn't.
have you ever had anal intercourse?
no.
man, this guy is really good.
he looks like my uncle.
wish me luck.
good luck.
well, girl. you tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
yes!
you're clean.
oh my god. i can't tell you how nervous i've been. i couldn't sleep last night.
now you gotta be careful.
jennie. you've tested positive for the hiv infection.
what?
the test isn't one hundred percent accurate. you should...
i tested positive?
i'm sorry.
but i only had sex with telly.
i wanna fuck darcy.
who?
darcy. benny's little sister.
oh. you like her?
yeah. i like her. i've wanted to get with her for a while now.
darcy?
yeah. she's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
yeah. she's only 13.
it's funny. last weekend at that block party. remember?
yeah.
she was handing out those watermelon slices. and i sat down over on the other side, and i watched her.
yeah.
i watched her eat the watermelon. and all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
yeah.
and after about two seconds, i got the biggest hard-on.
i'm not joking. i wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. at that point and moment, darcy was like a vision of perfection.
i know what you mean.
at that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
she hangs out at nasa. she promotes for them.
i'm gonna fuck her tonight. i swear to god i'm gonna fuck her.
how are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? that shits gotta be against the law.
i don't care motha fucka. i'll bet you money she fucks me.
bet.
you wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? get zooted?
i guess so. i gotta stop off home too.
i don't understand why you do that.
why i do what?
that.
why i give pennies?
yeah. why you give money.
did you look at that guy? what the fuck. he had no legs.  he had no half his lower body. he's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
that's just it. it's elitist. it's reverse elitism. because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. i notice what you do.
what are you talking about?
whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. you give them money. but if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
so.
so. these people live on the same streets. it's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. the regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
so. you never know when you can end up like that.
right.
i'll tell you why. because when i was little, i had a fat cousin, cousin luke. and he used to make fun of the handicapped. and one day he had a bad stomachache. so he drank a bottle of pepto and his ass blew off.
shut up.
i'm telling you the truth. and after that, i've always givin' my money to retards. because that's the reverse of what he did.
so really, it's good luck.
good luck?
yeah, good luck. i mean what the fuck. the guy had no legs.
shh. come on, it's gonna be ok.
that's it. i'm gonna have to tell my little brother, i'm gonna die. i can't make him his lunches anymore.
come on. don't cry. we'll work it out.
i only did it once and...
i gotta go. i gotta find telly.
don't go anywhere. stay with me.
i gotta find him.
i'm coming.
no. i just gotta go find him.
hi mom.
hi telly. where you been?
sorry. dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
but then i won't need your money.
that's right.
man, telly, your little brother is getting big.
yeah.
holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
shut the fuck up.
how much you gonna take?
i don't know. how much do you want?
about ten. fifteen is good.
fifteen for me.
you think darcy is gonna be at nasa tonight?
yeah probably.
yo, you got any weed around here?
naw. but we should run by the park and get a dime. maybe darcy will be at the park.
yo. i'm gonna get buff dude.
you are?
yeah. the other day, some sort of chinese bitch told me i'd look good with muscles.
nah.
why not? you stink.
that shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. i like my odor. it's fuckin' natural.
mom.
shh.
i'm gonna go out for a little while.
when are you gonna be back?
not too late.
four-thirty in the morning?
not too late.
hey mom. are you sure i can't get any money? just a few bucks.
if i had it, maybe. but right now i don't have a penny to my name.
all right.
hello.

is telly there? this is paul. who is this?
it's jennie. just tell me if telly is there.
oh hi jennie. do you want to come make out with me?
i'm fucking serious. where's telly?
telly's not here right now. i believe he went downtown. casper too.

where you goin' tonight?
maybe nasa. i don't know.

yeah.
i'm goin'. you on the list?
probably. fuck that, i'll sneak in. i need some female vagina tonight.
i had a female vagina last night.
how can you hang out with casper? he's such a jerk.
you think so?
yeah. i've always hated that kid. he used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
he still does.
i hate 'em.
it's not his fault. he had a hard life.
yeah?
you've heard the stories right?
no.
so that's why casper is how he is.
oh god. that's horrible.
yep.
holy shit. that's all true?
no. i was just kidding.
what?!
i lied. his dad is still alive. he works for the post office.
yeah watch the fuck where you skate. you know what i'm saying?

i'm gonna fuck you up bitch.
can i ask you a question? i'm sorry. i don't mean to be a pest.
what?
well, i don't mean to be a pest. it was just that i was looking at you. and you look upset. i liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. and i was wondering if i could be of any assistance? maybe i could cheer you up or somethin. help make you happy. who knows? somethin' maybe.
no. i'm ok. thanks.
you're ok?
yeah.
because gee, you don't look ok. i mean you're a very beautiful young lady. it's just that you look troubled that's all...
yeah well, it's been a bad day.
a bad day! you wanna hear a bad day? yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. she had a minor heart attack. partial paralysis. but i don't let myself get sad. no way. not me. it's not good for the soul.
sorry.
oh it's ok. that's life. maybe tomorrow i'll win lotto. who knows? you don't. no one does.
miss, would i be prying?
everything is wrong.
no, not everything? the sun is still shinning. it's a beautiful day out. some things are ok. right?
yeah, i guess so.
did you and your boyfriend just break up?
no.
are you in trouble with the law?
no.
am i getting warm?
now that's it. a smile. you look like a prom queen when you smile. like a glamour girl.
yeah?
oh yeah, sure. when i was a kid i had a crush on the prom queen. darlene louis. she had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. darlene louis. you know you look a little bit like her.
thanks.
yeah. right around the cheeks and chin. boy did i have a crush on her. she was the first girl i ever put my tongue in her mouth.
i swear to god. sometimes he barks. i can hear him straight off my arm. ruff, ruff, he goes.
yeah?
yeah. i'm not saying you should get a tattoo. but you should make yourself happy.
what if you can't make yourself happy? what if everything falls apart?
well then, i don't know. you know what you do then? you forget. block it out. i remember when i was a little boy. my grandmother told me to be happy. she said. she said, "leon, my darling little grandson. if you want to be happy don't think. don't bump into any walls. if you stutter. don't talk" and i took her advice. and look at me now. couldn't be happier.
your a real philosopher.
yeah. i was gonna write a book but i can't spell.
hurry up man. let's be out. i wanna go swimmin'.

i don't know. just some messy little scrap. you know that bullshit.

i thought you had a girlfriend.
naw. i'm not seeing anybody. what about you?
no. i can't. my mom won't let me have boyfriends.
she won't? why not?
i don't know. i guess it's cause my sister nicki had a baby when she was like 15. she was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
yeah. i can understand that.
i don't know. i just never seen girls that did that shit before. but i think it looks nice.
yeah. do it again.

because, you know why. you know.
because your a virgin?
because i'm a virgin and i don't want no baby.
you think i want a baby? when you're with me, you don't have to worry about that kinda stuff.
why is that?
because i like you. i think you're beautiful. i think if we fucked you would love it. you wouldn't even believe it.
i wouldn't believe it?
i don't know. i just think that you would love it.
but, i don't know. i'm just scared that things would change. between us.

oh my god, so good. that girl can fuck.
she can fuck?
hell yeah. that bitch was bleeding. when i first put it in she screamed real loud. i saw her bite down on the pillow.
oh shit. how long did it take?
did what take?
how long did you fuck her?
well it took me longer than i thought it would take. it took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. but once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. i had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. it hurts the first time.
yeah.
but then when she got into it. she really got into it. it was good.
how did she smell? did her puss stink?
oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
hell's yeah. she was so clean.
oh man, that's the best.
you could tell she took care of herself. she had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
let me smell it again.
you know what else?
what?
i can tell that she had just entered puberty.
how?
well, i was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
right.
and there was this picture of her painting easter eggs or something. and i said, you were cute when you were little.
yeah.
and she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. i look younger without my makeup.
and i looked at her, and thought to myself oh my god, this girl is a baby.
yeah.
and for a second i felt a little bit guilty. you know, because she's young and all. and then i was like, oh shit, that turns me on. i wanna fuck this little baby girl.
i'm telling you casper. i think i'm getting addicted to that shit.
to what? virgins?
yeah. it's like all i think about now. not just that, it's like lately during sex, i start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
what do you mean?
i mean i'm dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
you mean like fucking two virgins at once.
that would be good. but i mean more like. i don't know. like when i was having sex with her, i kept thinking how much i would like to put it in her ass. just to see what would happen.
she's probably smash you in the fucking face.
i don't know about that. she was pretty into it. but i wasn't gonna try. the whole thing is, you just gotta take it slow. show 'em some respect.
did you tell her that you loved her?
like. like. never love. love is for low-level virgin seduction guys.
shit.
what do you want?
get another forty.  smoke a blunt.
are you hungry?
hell yeah. fuckin' starvin'. wait up a sec.
you wanna go to paul's house?
what for? that guys a dick.
i'm sure he's got food. he's always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
you think he's got any herb?
i don't know, he quit dealin' but i'll bet he'll smoke us out.
you think?
probably.
he lives on 76th?
78th.
den less go joe.
telly.
yeah.
did she suck your dick?
a little bit. but i didn't really want her to.
why?
i don't know. that's too easy. i mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. that's so easy.
it is right.
i want to knock her guard down. i mean there's a whole philosophy behind it. having a virgin suck your dick, that's basic because there's nothing lost.
it's no big deal, right?
right. but when you deflower a girl, that's it. you did it. you were the one. no one else can ever do it.
yeah. the way i see it. my outlook on the this situation is.  it's like getting fame, you know what i'm saying. it's like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are gonna remember you because you were their first.
yep.
they're gonna tell their grand kids.  that telly. he sure was good in the sack!
you thirsty?
yeah, i feel dehydrated.
you got any money?
three pennies and a ball of lint.
you down with the boost?
unzip my pack, yo.
uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?
whah?
diss digg. i'm curious if you have it?
whah is dissdee?
diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
i no understand you. maybe crazy.
i'll ask you one last time. do you have diss digg?
whah you say? dissdee?
you know like in "the wonder twins" they share everything.
the cartoon?
yeah. "the wonder twins". you know.  activate in the form of, a glass of water.
yeah.
well, those guys share everything, right?
right.
and once i saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. where they lived the other's life for a day. you know those guys share everything, right?
right.
and it got me thinkin'. how fun it would be to share each other's girl.
yeah, that would be fun but i don't like any of the girls you go out with. like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
no, i'm serious man. i'm dead ass. do you wanna try? we could be like the fuckin x-rated "wonder twins"!
can you do it man?
can i do it? i just broke her cherry. i imagine i can make her do anything. bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire.
hello?
it's me. telly.
hello?
paul it's telly. open up.
what are you guys doing?
nothing. we just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
you want a wip-it?
nah.
so, how many people live here now?
i don't know, eight or nine.
where does everyone sleep?
everywhere. fuckin' flophouse. we're still short on the rent. if you want, you and casper can move in. you guys can share the bathtub.
that girl you boned last year. remember?
man i haven't seen her in forever. what the fuck's she up to?
telly says was up.
i knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. that dick.
you still mad at him?
of course. how am i gonna forgive him after what he did?!
first times are always wacked. just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
that shit is nothin'. i remember, i had just turned 14. with this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. i don't even remember his name. i think it was john or jake or something. i remember he had a brother named lentil because i would always joke and call him lentil bean. this was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
the pain. the fucking pain!
and you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
you are being ripped open.
i know.
did you bleed?
i didn't bleed.
you didn't?
no, i didn't bleed.
hell yeah. i love. i love sex.
foreplay. foreplay.
yep. that's the best way. it's that boom boom boom.
right. you know it's not like... you know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
yep.
making love is like.
sweet.
slow.
it's grandmother style.
yeah.
it's like...
you know what it's like. it's like when you really love someone, it's like awww.
yeah.
its like. but it gets boring. it's boring.
it's really slow. it's slow boring.
yeah.
it's very monotonous.
yeah. and sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.
it's like yeah whatever. but when you fuck. you wanna fuck that person. you're like ripping each other's hair out. ooooh.
right. you're like it's just this instinct. it's like this animal instinct is taking over you. it's like...
passion...
boom!!! boom!!!
but that's the thing. girl's like it slow. they like romance. they like things to be sweet and romantic.
yep.
i mean i've been with a lot of girls i know.
yeah me too nigga.
you know... you know a lot of times sex gets in the way. has that ever happened to you?
yep.
you know. because sometimes the foreplay is just so good. and then when it actually comes time for sex. it's like the worst letdown.
yep, yep. but he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
hell yeah, they don't know.
like where are your erogenous zones?
mine?
mine are like my neck and my chest.
yeah. mine are my toes. oh my god if someone sucks my toes i'll come in like ten seconds!
yeah. it depends. cause like this one time with eric, when we got blasted at his house. and smash j and dj flipper was there...
oh shit.
and we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. and he just pulled me over to the bed. and they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to disco
right.
and we were like underneath the sheets. we were going at it like crazy. oh my god that shit was so good! it was like hard...
yeah.
he was like sucking my tits. he was fucking fingering me. but that shit was nice and hard.
i was like yes! i'm going out with him!
that's right. that's why foreplay is better than sex.
yep.
because he can like climax you up to that...
yep.
but then the sex gets into the way and you're like: what happened! what the hell happened?!
yeah it's the biggest disappointment!
yeah. and it takes them either too long or too short to come. have you ever had someone that took forever
to come?
yeah. i had sex with jake, and it took him like an hour and a half.
yeah. the shit gets wacked. fifteen minutes.
yeah. fifteen minutes to a half an hour. hard and deep.
me. i can only take it up to fifteen minutes. cause i get bored.
yeah i get bored.
i start thinking about what i'm gonna eat afterwards.
i hate this game.
no. casper's right. girls love it. they just act like they don't in front of their friends.
i hate sucking dick!
yeah. 'cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
and sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
yeah. and then it hits that little thing.  that little punch bag. what is it? the tonsils. the esophagus, whatever.
yeah. and you're not getting anything out of it.
and it's like. how much more can i bob here? you know.
and you don't get shit out of it.
have you ever swallowed it before?
it was... it was.
it's like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
no, no, no. you can't get that taste out of your mouth. until you eat something.
yeah.
you can drink like there's no tomorrow but you still can't get that sperm between the teeth out. it's so disgusting.
that's the whole thing. you know if you look at it. i mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. and everyone's dying. and you better wear a condom or else. but the truth is. i don't know any kids with aids. no one i know has ever died from that shit. it's like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
yep.
i've known the past of all the people i've fucked without a condom. like i know one of the people got tested and was negative.
yeah.
and i know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so i knew he was safe.
yeah.
and the other person i just fucked, which was a mistake. but i went to the clinic last week with jennie.
i made her get tested with me because i didn't want to go alone.
did they ask you a lot of questions?
how old you?
17.
how old are you?
15.
how many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
umm. altogether?
yes. altogether.
hmm. i'd say eight, maybe nine.
how many times have you gone unprotected?
with four of them, i didn't use any kind of protection. wait, maybe it was three.
how many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
one.
were you protected?
have you ever had anal intercourse?
yes.
with how many people?
umm. three i believe. but i'm not sure.
were they wearing condoms?
uh. yes. twice they weren't. two times they didn't.
have you ever had anal intercourse?
no.
man, this guy is really good.
he looks like my uncle.
wish me luck.
good luck.
well, girl. you tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
yes!
you're clean.
oh my god. i can't tell you how nervous i've been. i couldn't sleep last night.
now you gotta be careful.
jennie. you've tested positive for the hiv infection.
what?
the test isn't one hundred percent accurate. you should...
i tested positive?
i'm sorry.
but i only had sex with telly.
i wanna fuck darcy.
who?
darcy. benny's little sister.
oh. you like her?
yeah. i like her. i've wanted to get with her for a while now.
darcy?
yeah. she's so little, so pretty, and innocent.
yeah. she's only 13.
it's funny. last weekend at that block party. remember?
yeah.
she was handing out those watermelon slices. and i sat down over on the other side, and i watched her.
yeah.
i watched her eat the watermelon. and all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
yeah.
and after about two seconds, i got the biggest hard-on.
i'm not joking. i wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. at that point and moment, darcy was like a vision of perfection.
i know what you mean.
at that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
she hangs out at nasa. she promotes for them.
i'm gonna fuck her tonight. i swear to god i'm gonna fuck her.
how are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? that shits gotta be against the law.
i don't care motha fucka. i'll bet you money she fucks me.
bet.
you wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? get zooted?
i guess so. i gotta stop off home too.
i don't understand why you do that.
why i do what?
that.
why i give pennies?
yeah. why you give money.
did you look at that guy? what the fuck. he had no legs.  he had no half his lower body. he's gotta shit out of his ribcage.
that's just it. it's elitist. it's reverse elitism. because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. i notice what you do.
what are you talking about?
whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. you give them money. but if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
so.
so. these people live on the same streets. it's just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. the regular bums aren't poor enough for you, you gotta give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
so. you never know when you can end up like that.
right.
i'll tell you why. because when i was little, i had a fat cousin, cousin luke. and he used to make fun of the handicapped. and one day he had a bad stomachache. so he drank a bottle of pepto and his ass blew off.
shut up.
i'm telling you the truth. and after that, i've always givin' my money to retards. because that's the reverse of what he did.
so really, it's good luck.
good luck?
yeah, good luck. i mean what the fuck. the guy had no legs.
shh. come on, it's gonna be ok.
that's it. i'm gonna have to tell my little brother, i'm gonna die. i can't make him his lunches anymore.
come on. don't cry. we'll work it out.
i only did it once and...
i gotta go. i gotta find telly.
don't go anywhere. stay with me.
i gotta find him.
i'm coming.
no. i just gotta go find him.
hi mom.
hi telly. where you been?
sorry. dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
but then i won't need your money.
that's right.
man, telly, your little brother is getting big.
yeah.
holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
shut the fuck up.
how much you gonna take?
i don't know. how much do you want?
about ten. fifteen is good.
fifteen for me.
you think darcy is gonna be at nasa tonight?
yeah probably.
yo, you got any weed around here?
naw. but we should run by the park and get a dime. maybe darcy will be at the park.
yo. i'm gonna get buff dude.
you are?
yeah. the other day, some sort of chinese bitch told me i'd look good with muscles.
nah.
why not? you stink.
that shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. i like my odor. it's fuckin' natural.
mom.
shh.
i'm gonna go out for a little while.
when are you gonna be back?
not too late.
four-thirty in the morning?
not too late.
hey mom. are you sure i can't get any money? just a few bucks.
if i had it, maybe. but right now i don't have a penny to my name.

how can you hang out with casper? he's such a jerk.
you think so?
yeah. i've always hated that kid. he used to eat glue in like seventh grade.
he still does.
i hate 'em.
it's not his fault. he had a hard life.
yeah?
you've heard the stories right?
no.
so that's why casper is how he is.
oh god. that's horrible.
yep.
holy shit. that's all true?
no. i was just kidding.

can i ask you a question? i'm sorry. i don't mean to be a pest.
what?
well, i don't mean to be a pest. it was just that i was looking at you. and you look upset. i liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. and i was wondering if i could be of any assistance? maybe i could cheer you up or somethin. help make you happy. who knows? somethin' maybe.
no. i'm ok. thanks.
you're ok?
yeah.
because gee, you don't look ok. i mean you're a very beautiful young lady. it's just that you look troubled that's all...
yeah well, it's been a bad day.
a bad day! you wanna hear a bad day? yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. she had a minor heart attack. partial paralysis. but i don't let myself get sad. no way. not me. it's not good for the soul.
sorry.
oh it's ok. that's life. maybe tomorrow i'll win lotto. who knows? you don't. no one does.
miss, would i be prying?
everything is wrong.
no, not everything? the sun is still shinning. it's a beautiful day out. some things are ok. right?
yeah, i guess so.
did you and your boyfriend just break up?
no.
are you in trouble with the law?
no.
am i getting warm?
now that's it. a smile. you look like a prom queen when you smile. like a glamour girl.
yeah?
oh yeah, sure. when i was a kid i had a crush on the prom queen. darlene louis. she had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. darlene louis. you know you look a little bit like her.
thanks.
yeah. right around the cheeks and chin. boy did i have a crush on her. she was the first girl i ever put my tongue in her mouth.
i swear to god. sometimes he barks. i can hear him straight off my arm. ruff, ruff, he goes.
yeah?
yeah. i'm not saying you should get a tattoo. but you should make yourself happy.
what if you can't make yourself happy? what if everything falls apart?
well then, i don't know. you know what you do then? you forget. block it out. i remember when i was a little boy. my grandmother told me to be happy. she said. she said, "leon, my darling little grandson. if you want to be happy don't think. don't bump into any walls. if you stutter. don't talk" and i took her advice. and look at me now. couldn't be happier.
your a real philosopher.
yeah. i was gonna write a book but i can't spell.

naw. i'm not seeing anybody. what about you?
no. i can't. my mom won't let me have boyfriends.
she won't? why not?
i don't know. i guess it's cause my sister nicki had a baby when she was like 15. she was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
yeah. i can understand that.
i don't know. i just never seen girls that did that shit before. but i think it looks nice.
