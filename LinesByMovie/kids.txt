you know what i want to do?
yeah.
what do i want to do?
you want to fuck me. but you can not fuck me.
why?
because, you know why. you know.
because your a virgin?
because I am a virgin and i do not want no baby.
you think i want a baby? when you are with me, you do not have to worry about that kinda stuff.
why is that?
because i like you. i think you are beautiful. i think if we fucked you would love it. you would not even believe it.
i would not believe it?
i do not know. i just think that you would love it.
but, i do not know. I am just scared that things would change. between us.
what things? I am telling you, nothing's going to change.  i want to make you happy. that is all.
you know it will not hurt. I will be gentle. i promise.
do you care about me?
of course i do.
shit.
was up bitch?
what do you think?
you fucked it?
i knew you fucked it! i sat out here for like two hours! that girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
who am i? who am i? the mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
well, how was it?
oh my god, so good. that girl can fuck.
she can fuck?
hell yeah. that bitch was bleeding. when i first put it in she screamed real loud. i saw her bite down on the pillow.
oh shit. how long did it take?
did what take?
how long did you fuck her?
well it took me longer than i thought it would take. it took like 15 minutes to talk her into it. but once it was on, we fucked for a good half an hour. i had to keep taking it out and putting it back in. it hurts the first time.
yeah.
but then when she got into it. she really got into it. it was good.
how did she smell? did her puss stink?
oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
hell's yeah. she was so clean.
oh man, that is the best.
you could tell she took care of herself. she had all these powders and creams in her bathroom.
let me smell it again.
you know what else?
what?
i can tell that she had just entered puberty.
how?
well, i was flipping through a picture book of her and her family, right.
right.
and there was this picture of her painting easter eggs or something. and i said, you were cute when you were little.
yeah.
and she goes, yeah that picture was taken less than a year ago. i look younger without my makeup.
and i looked at her, and thought to myself oh my god, this girl is a baby.
yeah.
and for a second i felt a little bit guilty. you know, because she is young and all. and then i was like, oh shit, that turns me on. i wanna fuck this little baby girl.
I am telling you casper. i think I am getting addicted to that shit.
to what? virgins?
yeah. it is like all i think about now. not just that, it is like lately during sex, i start dreaming about these complex fantasies.
what do you mean?
i mean I am dreaming about going all out, crazy shit.
you mean like fucking two virgins at once.
that would be good. but i mean more like. i do not know. like when i was having sex with her, i kept thinking how much i would like to put it in her ass. just to see what would happen.
she is probably smash you in the fucking face.
i do not know about that. she was pretty into it. but i was not going to try. the whole thing is, you just got to take it slow. show 'em some respect.
did you tell her that you loved her?
like. like. never love. love is for low-level virgin seduction guys.
shit.
what do you want?
get another forty.  smoke a blunt.
are you hungry?
hell yeah. fuckin' starvin'. wait up a sec.
you wanna go to paul's house?
what for? that guys a dick.
I am sure he is got food. he is always got those microwave burrito things in his freezer.
you think he is got any herb?
i do not know, he quit dealin' but I will bet he will smoke us out.
you think?
probably.
he lives on 76th?
78th.
den less go joe.
telly.
yeah.
did she suck your dick?
a little bit. but i did not really want her to.
why?
i do not know. that is too easy. i mean getting a virgin to suck your dick. that is so easy.
it is right.
i want to knock her guard down. i mean there is a whole philosophy behind it. having a virgin suck your dick, that is basic because there is nothing lost.
it is no big deal, right?
right. but when you deflower a girl, that is it. you did it. you were the one. no one else can ever do it.
yeah. the way i see it. my outlook on the this situation is.  it is like getting fame, you know what I am saying. it is like, if you died tomorrow, and fifty years from now all the virgins you fucked are going to remember you because you were their first.
yep.
they are going to tell their grand kids.  that telly. he sure was good in the sack!
you thirsty?
yeah, i feel dehydrated.
you got any money?
three pennies and a ball of lint.
you down with the boost?
unzip my pack, yo.
uh, let's see here, would you happen to have diss digg?
whah?
diss digg. I am curious if you have it?
whah is dissdee?
diss digg, diss digg, diss digg.
i no understand you. maybe crazy.
I will ask you one last time. do you have diss digg?
whah you say? dissdee?
you know like in "the wonder twins" they share everything.
the cartoon?
yeah. "the wonder twins". you know.  activate in the form of, a glass of water.
yeah.
well, those guys share everything, right?
right.
and once i saw this episode where they pretended they were each other. where they lived the other's life for a day. you know those guys share everything, right?
right.
and it got me thinkin'. how fun it would be to share each other's girl.
yeah, that would be fun but i do not like any of the girls you go out with. like that one girl with two teeth and a clit ring.
no, I am serious man. I am dead ass. do you wanna try? we could be like the fuckin x-rated "wonder twins"!
can you do it man?
can i do it? i just broke her cherry. i imagine i can make her do anything. bark like a dog, jump through a ring of fire.
hello?
it is me. telly.
hello?
paul it is telly. open up.
what are you guys doing?
nothing. we just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
you want a wip-it?
nah.
so, how many people live here now?
i do not know, eight or nine.
where does everyone sleep?
everywhere. fuckin' flophouse. we are still short on the rent. if you want, you and casper can move in. you guys can share the bathtub.
that girl you boned last year. remember?
man i have not seen her in forever. what the fuck's she up to?
telly says was up.
i knew he would not want to speak to me. that dick.
you still mad at him?
of course. how am i gonna forgive him after what he did?!
first times are always wacked. just be glad you did not lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
that shit is nothin'. i remember, i had just turned 14. with this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. i do not even remember his name. i think it was john or jake or something. i remember he had a brother named lentil because i would always joke and call him lentil bean. this was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
the pain. the fucking pain!
and you feel like you are being ripped open inside.
you are being ripped open.
i know.
did you bleed?
i did not bleed.
you didn't?
no, i did not bleed.
hell yeah. i love. i love sex.
foreplay. foreplay.
yep. that is the best way. it is that boom boom boom.
right. you know it is not like... you know there is a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
yep.
making love is like.
sweet.
slow.
it is grandmother style.
yeah.
it is like...
you know what it is like. it is like when you really love someone, it is like awww.
yeah.
its like. but it gets boring. it is boring.
it is really slow. it is slow boring.
yeah.
it is very monotonous.
yeah. and sex is just like, yeah let's have sex.
it is like yeah whatever. but when you fuck. you wanna fuck that person. you are like ripping each other's hair out. ooooh.
right. you are like it is just this instinct. it is like this animal instinct is taking over you. it is like...
passion...
boom!!! boom!!!
but that is the thing. girl's like it slow. they like romance. they like things to be sweet and romantic.
yep.
i mean I have been with a lot of girls i know.
yeah me too nigga.
you know... you know a lot of times sex gets in the way. has that ever happened to you?
yep.
you know. because sometimes the foreplay is just so good. and then when it actually comes time for sex. it is like the worst letdown.
yep, yep. but he has to know what he is doing and where he is going. because they can like touch you for hours and they will not ever know.
hell yeah, they do not know.
like where are your erogenous zones?
mine?
mine are like my neck and my chest.
yeah. mine are my toes. oh my god if someone sucks my toes I will come in like ten seconds!
yeah. it depends. cause like this one time with eric, when we got blasted at his house. and smash j and dj flipper was there...
oh shit.
and we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. and he just pulled me over to the bed. and they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to disco
right.
and we were like underneath the sheets. we were going at it like crazy. oh my god that shit was so good! it was like hard...
yeah.
he was like sucking my tits. he was fucking fingering me. but that shit was nice and hard.
i was like yes! I am going out with him!
that is right. that is why foreplay is better than sex.
yep.
because he can like climax you up to that...
yep.
but then the sex gets into the way and you are like: what happened! what the hell happened?!
yeah it is the biggest disappointment!
yeah. and it takes them either too long or too short to come. have you ever had someone that took forever
to come?
yeah. i had sex with jake, and it took him like an hour and a half.
yeah. the shit gets wacked. fifteen minutes.
yeah. fifteen minutes to a half an hour. hard and deep.
me. i can only take it up to fifteen minutes. cause i get bored.
yeah i get bored.
i start thinking about what I am going to eat afterwards.
i hate this game.
no. casper's right. girls love it. they just act like they do not in front of their friends.
i hate sucking dick!
yeah. 'cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
and sometimes it takes a long time, and you are fucking gagging.
yeah. and then it hits that little thing.  that little punch bag. what is it? the tonsils. the esophagus, whatever.
yeah. and you are not getting anything out of it.
and it is like. how much more can i bob here? you know.
and you do not get shit out of it.
have you ever swallowed it before?
it was... it was.
it is like sweet and sour, and salty butter.
no, no, no. you can not get that taste out of your mouth. until you eat something.
yeah.
you can drink like there is no tomorrow but you still can not get that sperm between the teeth out. it is so disgusting.
that is the whole thing. you know if you look at it. i mean all you hear about is disease this and disease that. and everyone's dying. and you better wear a condom or else. but the truth is. i do not know any kids with aids. no one i know has ever died from that shit. it is like some weird make-believe story that the whole world believes.
yep.
I have known the past of all the people I have fucked without a condom. like i know one of the people got tested and was negative.
yeah.
and i know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so i knew he was safe.
yeah.
and the other person i just fucked, which was a mistake. but i went to the clinic last week with jennie.
i made her get tested with me because i did not want to go alone.
did they ask you a lot of questions?
how old you?
17.
how old are you?
15.
how many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
umm. altogether?
yes. altogether.
hmm. I would say eight, maybe nine.
how many times have you gone unprotected?
with four of them, i did not use any kind of protection. wait, maybe it was three.
how many people have you had vaginal intercourse with?
one.
were you protected?
have you ever had anal intercourse?
yes.
with how many people?
umm. three i believe. but I am not sure.
were they wearing condoms?
uh. yes. twice they weren't. two times they didn't.
have you ever had anal intercourse?
no.
man, this guy is really good.
he looks like my uncle.
wish me luck.
good luck.
well, girl. you tested negative for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.
yes!
you are clean.
oh my god. i can not tell you how nervous I have been. i could not sleep last night.
now you gotta be careful.
jennie. you have tested positive for the hiv infection.
what?
the test is not one hundred percent accurate. you should...
i tested positive?
I am sorry.
but i only had sex with telly.
i wanna fuck darcy.
who?
darcy. benny's little sister.
oh. you like her?
yeah. i like her. I have wanted to get with her for a while now.
darcy?
yeah. she is so little, so pretty, and innocent.
yeah. she is only 13.
it is funny. last weekend at that block party. remember?
yeah.
she was handing out those watermelon slices. and i sat down over on the other side, and i watched her.
yeah.
i watched her eat the watermelon. and all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
yeah.
and after about two seconds, i got the biggest hard-on.
I am not joking. i wanted to take my dick out and start jacking right there. at that point and moment, darcy was like a vision of perfection.
i know what you mean.
at that moment, at that block party, she represented everything holy about a virgin.
she hangs out at nasa. she promotes for them.
I am going to fuck her tonight. i swear to god I am going to fuck her.
how are you gonna fuck two virgins in a day? that shits gotta be against the law.
i do not care motha fucka. I will bet you money she fucks me.
bet.
you wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? get zooted?
i guess so. i gotta stop off home too.
i do not understand why you do that.
why i do what?
that.
why i give pennies?
yeah. why you give money.
did you look at that guy? what the fuck. he had no legs.  he had no half his lower body. he is got to shit out of his ribcage.
that is just it. it is elitist. it is reverse elitism. because you give money to whoever is the most fucked up. i notice what you do.
what are you talking about?
whenever you see someone who is really messed up, especially amputees and retards. you give them money. but if it is just a regular bum, you pass them by.
so.
so. these people live on the same streets. it is just that you reserve your money for those people who are massively fucked up. the regular bums are not poor enough for you, you got to give it to the bottom of the barrel scum fucks.
so. you never know when you can end up like that.
right.
I will tell you why. because when i was little, i had a fat cousin, cousin luke. and he used to make fun of the handicapped. and one day he had a bad stomachache. so he drank a bottle of pepto and his ass blew off.
shut up.
I am telling you the truth. and after that, I have always givin' my money to retards. because that is the reverse of what he did.
so really, it is good luck.
good luck?
yeah, good luck. i mean what the fuck. the guy had no legs.
shh. come on, it is going to be ok.
that is it. I am going to have to tell my little brother, I am going to die. i can not make him his lunches anymore.
come on. do not cry. we will work it out.
i only did it once and...
i gotta go. i gotta find telly.
do not go anywhere. stay with me.
i gotta find him.
I am coming.
no. i just gotta go find him.
hi mom.
hi telly. where you been?
sorry. dad made me promise not to give you any money until you find a job.
but then i will not need your money.
that is right.
man, telly, your little brother is getting big.
yeah.
holy shit man, your mom's got good titties.
shut the fuck up.
how much you gonna take?
i do not know. how much do you want?
about ten. fifteen is good.
fifteen for me.
you think darcy is gonna be at nasa tonight?
yeah probably.
yo, you got any weed around here?
naw. but we should run by the park and get a dime. maybe darcy will be at the park.
yo. I am going to get buff dude.
you are?
yeah. the other day, some sort of chinese bitch told me I would look good with muscles.
nah.
why not? you stink.
that shit gives me a rash all under my arms and around my stomach. i like my odor. it is fuckin' natural.
mom.
shh.
I am going to go out for a little while.
when are you gonna be back?
not too late.
four-thirty in the morning?

i hate 'em.
it is not his fault. he had a hard life.
yeah?
you have heard the stories right?

yep.

what?
well, i do not mean to be a pest. it was just that i was looking at you. and you look upset. i liked looking at you, but your face looks upset. and i was wondering if i could be of any assistance? maybe i could cheer you up or somethin. help make you happy. who knows? somethin' maybe.
no. I am ok. thanks.
you are ok?
yeah.
because gee, you do not look ok. i mean you are a very beautiful young lady. it is just that you look troubled that is all...
yeah well, it is been a bad day.
a bad day! you wanna hear a bad day? yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. she had a minor heart attack. partial paralysis. but i do not let myself get sad. no way. not me. it is not good for the soul.
sorry.
oh it is ok. that is life. maybe tomorrow I will win lotto. who knows? you don't. no one does.
miss, would i be prying?
everything is wrong.
no, not everything? the sun is still shinning. it is a beautiful day out. some things are ok. right?
yeah, i guess so.
did you and your boyfriend just break up?
no.
are you in trouble with the law?
no.
am i getting warm?
now that is it. a smile. you look like a prom queen when you smile. like a glamour girl.
yeah?
oh yeah, sure. when i was a kid i had a crush on the prom queen. darlene louis. she had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. darlene louis. you know you look a little bit like her.
thanks.
yeah. right around the cheeks and chin. boy did i have a crush on her. she was the first girl i ever put my tongue in her mouth.
i swear to god. sometimes he barks. i can hear him straight off my arm. ruff, ruff, he goes.
yeah?
yeah. I am not saying you should get a tattoo. but you should make yourself happy.
what if you can not make yourself happy? what if everything falls apart?
well then, i do not know. you know what you do then? you forget. block it out. i remember when i was a little boy. my grandmother told me to be happy. she said. she said, "leon, my darling little grandson. if you want to be happy do not think. do not bump into any walls. if you stutter. do not talk" and i took her advice. and look at me now. could not be happier.
your a real philosopher.

naw. I am not seeing anybody. what about you?
no. i can't. my mom will not let me have boyfriends.
