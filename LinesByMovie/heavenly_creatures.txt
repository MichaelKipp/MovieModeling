mummy!
mummy!
she's terribly hurt . . .
somebody's got to help us!
let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, nora?
playfully shoves his hand away.
i'll think you'll find our mr. bayliss is not keen on seafood. i've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
sighs as honora puts the frying pan on the stove.
hello!
well? tell us! how'd it go?
got an a, mum!
glows with pride. steve is emptying his pockets on the bench. honora pats steve's hand.
0h, god . . . i'm so sorry!
it doesn't matter.
of course it matters! it's mario!
i think i'm dying . . .
don't . . . please! please, don't!
i wish james would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as jesus!
daddy says the bible's a load of bunkum!
but, we're all going to heaven!
i'm not! i'm going to the fourth world! it's like heaven, only better because there aren't any christians.
james will be there . . . and mario! only they'll be saints.
saint mario!
to be known as he!
he . . .
him.
him . . .
this.
this . . .
that.
that . . .
come on! sausage rolls.
come on through.
and pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
look who i've found!
whips off her pinny as herbert leads juliet into the dining room.
and so, in a blazing fury, charles runs lancelot trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving deborah free to accept charles's proposal of marriage!
and herbert exchange a glance. honora smiles at juliet.
i've heard your mother on 3ya. the woman's session has lots of lively debate.
well, actually, mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with the marriage guidance council.
i wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
oh, no . . . mummy's awfully good at it.
mummy has a special technique called "deep therapy."
what's that?
i'm not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular!
i adore anything to do with the arts.
we're pretty handy with model making, too, eh?
i've never cottoned on to plasticine like you girls, but i enjoy making things out of wood.
are you a carpenter, mr. rieper? herbert shakes his head.
i work at dennis brothers fish supply.
he's the manager!
leads a young man-john-into the dining room.
this story of yours-maybe the school newspaper will print it when it's finished.
actually, mr. rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to new york. that's where all the big publishing houses are based.
is that a fact! you'd better put me name down for an advance copy!
he flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!
god, yes!
what?
it's so beautiful!
what???
i shall call him diello.
you're such an incredible woman.
i couldn't have done it without you, charles.
i spent a wretched night. it would be wonderful if i could get tuberculosis, too.
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
come on, sit up.
i'm not hungry.
you've got to eat, yvonne. you hardly touched our dinner. i'm not having you falling ill.
i just want to be on my own for a while.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to pauline.
you may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but i haven't!
holds up a loaded fork. pauline reluctantly takes it.
do you think juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
but she'll have no one to look after her!
her parents won't be going overseas now . . . they'll have to cancel their trip. don't worry about juliet.
i've booked you in for a chest x-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
pops a couple more potatoes on pauline's plate. herbert glances at pauline.
thought i'd have a go at building the birdhouse on saturday . . . anyone want to give me a hand?
i'm so happy to see you!
hurries over.
it's best not to get too close. juliet's still not a hundred percent. hello, juliet! we've bought you some fruit.
thank you so much!
that's coming along well!
i'm the matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
i'm saving them for a rainy day.
gives her a sympathetic look.
i know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
they sent me off to the bahamas "for the good of my health." they sent me to the bay of bloody islands "for the good of my health."
looks startled at the outburst.
i'm sorry, mrs. rieper. i'm feeling quite fatigued.
we don't want to tire you out, dear.
stands and picks up her handbag. pauline stands and juliet grabs her hand.
can't you stay a bit longer, paul?
you'll never guess what's happened!!
what??
john has fallen in love with me!
that idiot boarder?
how do you know? did he tell you?
well . . . no. but it's so obvious.
i had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now i realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
from now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
if you think for one minute that your father and i will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! you're only 14!!! you're a child! what on earth's the matter with you, yvonne? you know what can happen with boys . . . don't you have any self-respect?
sighs.
can i go now?
grabs pauline by the shoulders.
my god, what a disgrace you are! you shame me, you shame the family. you're nothing but a cheap little tart!
well, i guess i take after you then!
whirls around and slaps pauline on the cheek.
you ran off with dad when you were only 17! nana parker told me!
steps back.
yvonne hasn't been herself, either. locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
sits down next to honora, glass of sherry in hand.
no arguments there, dr. hulme! all that time inside working on those novels of theirs. they don't get fresh air or exercise!
frowns at henry.
waves a pair of new socks around. the family laughing and talking. pauline is not participating. she is leaning back, looking morose. honora looks at her with concern.
is it hurting, dear?
my name is gina!
it's a letter from the school . . . from miss stewart.
what does old stew want?
she says the standard of your work is slipping. at this rate she doesn't think you'll get school certificate.
who cares!
i care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
i'm educating myself!
you're failing english . . . you used to be top of the class- pauline i'm doing my own writing!
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
these stories are not going to get you school certificate! you don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
what do you know? you wouldn't know the first thing about writing. you're the most ignorant person i've ever met!
is very angry.
you're rude . . . rude and insolent! i don't see why i should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
i don't wanna be in bloody school!
all right! you go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!
i think i'm going crazy.
no, you're not, gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
let's go overseas . . .
you mean travel by ourselves?
stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
hurry up! i'm freezing!
just a couple more . . .
i know, i'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
i'm sure they'll notice things missing.
they'll blame the bloody housekeeper. she nicks stuff all the times!
this lot's got to be worth 50 quid!
i can try my father's safe. i'm sure i can get the keys to his office.
that's great! we'll have the fare in no time!
i thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
that was what we were led to believe . . .
poor mother was completely taken in.
do you think bloody bill's trying to get into her draws?
too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! nobody gets into mother's draws except daddy!
poor father . . .
don't worry, gina! mummy and daddy love each other.
i'm bloody dressing as fast as i can, for god's sake!
open this door!
the hulmes will look after me. they want me to live with them!
don't be so ridiculous. you're our daughter, you belong here with us.
i belong with deborah! we're going to south africa!
you're not going anywhere. you're 15 years old!!
you have to let me go!
stands and walks toward the door.
i felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
love, you can still write to each other.
but that's not true! i've got one.
i need my sodding parents' consent.
is chopping firewood in the back garden. honora approaches him.
i've just had hilda hulme on the phone.
what now?
she says juliet's in a terrible state . . .
accompanies hilda into the hallway.
breaks down into heavy sobs.
i'm coming with you.
yes . . .
i know what to do about mother.
mummy!
mummy!
hello!
hello, juliet. juliet take off her jacket.
oh-what a nice outfit!
thank you. i bought it especially, mrs. rieper.
is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. both girls look at honora silently.
turns around and juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
fruit.
oh! i'll pop them in a bowl.
let's go upstairs, deborah. i wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
all right, then.
it's a three-act story with a tragic end.
your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
i thought for hours about whether carmelita should accept bernard's marriage proposal . . .
i think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
i bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
that's enough, yvonne!
i'd better be getting back. bye, love.
pulls his coat on. honora gives him a peck cheek.
bye.
have a nice outing, you lot.
bye, dad.
goodbye, mr. rieper.
wanders out. honora turns to pauline and juliet.
well . . . i better make myself a bit more presentable.
isn't it beautiful!
let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, mummy!
you have it.
oh, no. i'm watching my figure.
but you're not fat, mrs. rieper!
i put on a lot of weight over christmas.
look, mother!
looks down at the ground in front of her.
