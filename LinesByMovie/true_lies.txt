switching to sub-vocal.  gib, you copy?
it is talkradio.  you are on the air.
this is persian, if I am not mistaken.
very good.  it is sixth century b.c.  do you like the period?
i adore it.
call me, if you would like to see some of my other pieces.
I would like that.
harry!  where are you!
in the helicopter.
harry?  harry?!
what?
what is this for?
for dana, schmuck.  bring your kid something.  you know.  the dad thing.
got it.  nice touch.  okay, pick me up at eight.  the de-brief is at ten hundred.
what a team.  see you at eight.
yep.  sleep fast.
hi, honey.  how was the flight?
fine, honey.  stay asleep.
okay.
I am late.
me too.
how did it go at the trade show? you make all the other salesmen jealous?
yeah.  you should have seen it. we were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they have ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
that is fabulous harry.
yeah, it was wild.
uh huh.  okay.
it is not okay.  it is extortion.
what did you tell him?
i slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
good thinking, honey.
thanks dear.
here, check these out.
son of a bitch!
what?
kids.  ten seconds of joy. thirty years of misery.
she knows not to steal.  I have taught her better than that.
yeah, but you are not her parents, anymore, you and helen.  her parents are axl rose and madonna. the five minutes you spend a day with her can not compete with that kind of constant bombardment. you are outgunned, amigo.
see, kids now are ten years ahead				* of where we were at the same age. you probably think she is still a virgin--
do not be ridiculous.  she is only -- how old is she?
fourteen, harry.
right.  she is only fourteen.
uh huh.  and her little hormones are going like a fire alarm.  i				* say even money that physicist on				* the bike is boinkin' her.						*
no way.  not dana.
okay.  okay.  de-nail am not just a river in egypt.  she is probably stealing the money to pay for an abortion.
will you just open the door!					*
twenty here, fifty there... i figured my wife's boyfriend was taking it.
i thought you moved out.
well .  .  .  i moved back in. my lawyer said it would give me a better claim on the house in the property settlement.  do not change the subject... you owe me two hundred bucks.
harry tasker.  one zero zero two four.
albert gibson.  three four nine nine one.
janice, how many years have you been buzzing us in?
ten, mr. gibson.
and you still reach for your piece every time.
yes sir.
god!  you have no idea how much that turns me on.  I have never had the courage to say this before but... i love you, janice.
yes, sir.
you better watch it.  she might file on you for sexual harassment.
in her dreams.
faisil.  you are new on harry's team, are not you?
yes.
so what makes you think that the slack i cut him in any way translates to you?!
sorry, sir.  uh... here's what we got.
i mean, it is not like he is saving the world or anything.  he is a sales rep for chrissakes. whenever i can not get to sleep i ask him to tell me about his day. six seconds and I am out.  but he acts like he is curing cancer or something.
so i guess you did not get away					* for the weekend after all?					*
are you kidding?  harry had to go out of town.
I am shocked.
yeah.  you know harry.
you bitch.
girlfriend, you got a man.  you				* just have to take control .  . .  set up the right mood.						*
harry only has two moods: busy...				* and asleep.
then you better do something to				* jumpstart that man's motor.  you know... wake up the sleeping giant of his passion.
it does not mean anything.  she buys antiquities for khaled.
nope.  the art buys are in a separate ledger.
and this is a little above market-				* rate for the horizontal bop, even				* for a total biscuit like her.
alright, i want a complete workup on her.  do we know where she is?
uh huh.  right here in river city.
you are kidding.
she lives in rome, but she does stuff here the smithsonian and has a lot of diplomatic connections, so she has offices				* here.										*
i need you to talk to dana.  the vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.
I will handle it.
dana, mr. hardy called.  why were not you in class today?
he lies!  i was there!  i was in the nurse's office, cause i had a headache.
you seem fine now.
great!  you are going to believe that fat dweeb mr. hardy over your own daughter.
I am not sure what to believe anymore, young lady.  you never used to lie to me.  but lately you do not seem to know the difference between right and wrong.
dana, are you listening to me?
yeah, dad.
you know you can always talk to me.  right?  whatever is going on in your life, your mom and I will understand.
okay, dad.
you would tell me if there was something wrong, would not you, pumpkin?
I am not a pumpkin!  okay?!!  do i look even remotely like a pumpkin?! I am not a muffin, or a cupcake or a honeybear either! and you do not understand anything dad...
it is all set up...  ghost phones and fax, all the usual stuff. you have a suite at the marquis hotel under renquist.  okay, reality check.  go.
hi, I am harry renquist.  i own a--
well, what is the point of waiting?
i agree.
so your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
that is right.  they want something...  dramatic.  i spoke to a number of people who said you are the one to see.
let's see... that you can read ancient sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  and that other dealers and archeologists do not like you much.
those wimps.  it is because i use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  i told you to move those crates an hour ago.  come on guys, let's get going.
she is importing stuff from all over the mid-east.
she could be moving money, guns. anything.
and the second you left there, we started getting calls to the					* ghost numbers.  they were checking out the renquist front.
okay.  let's step up the surveillance on her.  put on two more guys.
it is a good thing you pay me well.
do you realize that there are surveillance teams watching this place right now?  your phones are almost certainly tapped.  and you are busy laughing and flirting like a whore with this renquist, who may be a--
no.  he checked out okay--
what do you want me to do?
find out who this renquist it.
how?
use the gifts that allah has given you.
hi honey.  what is going on?					*
sorry to bother you in a meeting, but you have to promise me that				* you will be home at eight.  i don't				* want dana and i sitting here by ourselves like we were last year. you promise?
baby, i said I would be there. really.  trust me.  got to go, honey.  bye bye.
what?  it is on the way.  she says she is got something for me.
yeah, right.
do you like my tomb?  the museum				* financing fell out, so i thought				* your clients might be interested.
it is certainly... dramatic.
especially in this light.  this is the only light they had then,				* so i like to study it this way. i love this place.  i love all ruins.
is that why you got into this business?
I have always been a collector at heart.  when i see something i want, i have to have it.
and you have a reputation as someone who gets what she wants.
yes.
yes what?
uh, yes, it is important.
station wagon?
uh huh.  want me to lose them?
helen's going to be pissed.
see, that is the problem with terrorists.  they are really inconsiderate when it comes to people's schedules.
what is the plan?
gonna try to get a closer shot of				* beavis & butthead.							*
there is another guy, still in the car.
stay on him.
where are you going?
out.  if dad does not care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should i care? I am going to a movie.
no you are not.  you are going to stay here until your father gets home and have cake!
mom, wake up!  dad barely knows we exist.
that is not true, honey--
it is true!  he does not know anything about me.  he still thinks I am like ten years old or something.  as long as i just smile and say yes to whatever he says, like his good little fantasy daughter, he thinks everything's fine.  but it is not fine.  nothing's fine.
copy that.
and make it fast.  my horse is getting tired.
look, i know you are upset.  I am really sorry, honey.  i raced home as quick--
it is okay, do not bother, harry.
I am sorry.  thank you for the party.
yeah.  it was great.
come on to bed, you do not have to brush your teeth.
I will just be a second.  so what happened tonight at the office?
i could not believe it.  i go back to get this report i need, right, and the phone is ringing, so like a bonehead i answer it--
it is the big client in japan, and it is the middle of the morning there and their whole system is crashed... this guy's having a meltdown--
what did you do, honey?
well i pull out the manual on their setup, which is the new 680 server...
...and I am troubleshooting it with them over the phone... talking to a translator, right, who is getting half of it wrong... it was unbelievable...  really wild.
it sounds wild.  so now you are a big hero, right?  for fixing their system.
uh huh.
my husband the hero.
hey, did that guy harry chased last night call in to give himself up yet?  cause apparently that is the only way we are going to catch the son of a bitch --
okay.  here she comes.
look at the way the little punk is driving.  he is all over the place.  look-- he has not signalled once.
goddammit!  that is outrageous.
so, you wanna play huh?  you little--
that is it.  get 'im harry  we will teach that little puke not to signal.
ha!  the little prick ditched you!  that is so goddamn funny.
son of a bitch!
can we go to the office now, mr. superspy?
abu kaleem malik.
hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in rome, and the 727 out of lisbon last year.  major player.				*
they call him "the sand spider".				*
why?
probably because it sounds scary.				*
this is impressive, gentlemen. of course, it would have been even more impressive if you actually knew where he was.
look, uh... I have got to talk to helen about this thing with dana. I am just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
you want me to just hang-- ?
just hang a minute.
I will just hang then, shall i?
helen!  it is your mystery man.
simon?  ohmygod.
can you cover me for an hour?
just an hour?  you should tell this stud to take more time.
will you shutup.  i should never have told you about him.
he-- helen.  helen-- it is helen. it is helen, gib.
something to do with helen, is what I am getting.
she is having an affair.
congratulations.  welcome to the club.
it can not be.  not helen.
nobody believes it can happen to them.
it can not be.
same thing happened to me with wife two.  i had no idea until i came home and the house was empty.  i mean empty.  she even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  what kind of person would think of that?
i still do not believe it.
relax.  helen still loves you. she just wants this guy to bang her.  it is nothing serious. you will get used to it after a --
is this national security stuff boring you?
put a tap on her phone.
what are you talking about?  we have that.
helen's phone.  her office line and the line at my house.
yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  do not give me that crap. just put on the taps.  now.
sure, harry.  I am on it.
how was school today?
fine.
i was in the area, and i thought you might like to have lunch.
they must have just missed me.
they said you had to run out.
yeah.  it was a rush thing.  they needed some documents down at the court house.  i barely made it.
so, a little excitement in an otherwise dull day.  did is work out okay?
oh, sure.  fine.  I will get some more gravy.
hello?
helen?  it is simon.  is it safe to talk?
yes.  go ahead.
yes.  i suppose so.  where?
the same place.  one o'clock.  i have to go now.  see you tomorrow.  remember, i need you.
i thought we might have lunch tomorrow.
i can't, honey.  i promised allison I would go shopping with her. sorry.
are you sure you were not followed?
i kept looking back, like you taught me.  i did not see anyone.
okay.  it is just, things are a bit hot for me right now.  if i get a signal...  i may have to leave suddenly.
i understand.
it is my job to risk my life, but not yours.  i feel bad about bringing you into this, but you are the only one i can trust.
where were you?  on a... uh,					* mission?
ssshhh!  we say op.  covert					* operation.  and this one got a little rough.
worse than cairo?							*
cairo was a day at the beach next				* to this.
guy's a spook!
yeah, but for who?							*
he could be working her to get to you.
did you read the papers yesterday?
yes.
sometimes a story is a mask for a covert operation.  see-- two men killed in a restroom, and two unidentified men in a running					* shootout, ending at the						* marriot...
that was you?!
you recognized my style.  see, you are very good.  you are a natural at this.
tell me what happened?
I am sorry, i can't.
you can trust me completely.
i know.  but it would compromise your safety too much to know certain things.
right, of course.  i was worried when i did not hear from you that night.
it is strange.  i knew i was in a woman's thoughts when i was shooting it out with those assassins.
were they trying to kill you?					*
three of them.  hardly worth					* talking about.  two will not bother				* me again.
and you chased one?
something came over me, i just had nail him, no matter what the				* risk.  it was pretty hairy.  i thought he had me, a couple of					* times.  but i really can not take credit .  .  .
what is it you want me to do?
not here.  I will call you and we will rendezvous again.  we have to leave separately, so we are not seen together.  for your safety.
you will call me then?
yes.  now go.
what are we talking about here? pussy, right?
absolutely.
let's face it, harry, the vette gets 'em wet.  but it is not enough.  if you want to really close escrow, you got to have an angle.
and you have got one.
it is killer.  look at me-- I am not that much to look at.  no really.  i can be honest.  but i got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  some are.
so what is your angle?
sorry.  trade secret.
sure.  set me up and then do not tell me.
okay, just ask yourself.  what do women really want?  you take these bored housewives, married to the same guy for years.  stuck in a rut.  they need some release.  the promise of adventure.  a hint of danger.  i create that for them.
so you are basically lying your ass off the whole time?  i could not do it.
well, think of it as playing a role.  it is fantasy.  you have to work on their dreams.  get them out of their daily suburban grind for a few hours.
is not that hard to keep up, in the long run?
does not matter.  i like change. you know, constant turnover.  as soon as i close the deal, it is one of two more times, then adios.
use 'em and lose 'em.
exactly.  the trick is, you got to pick your target.  they have to be nice little housewife types. school-teachers.  but, I am telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
what about the husbands?
dickless.  if they took care of				* business, I would be out of business, know what i mean?
those idiots.
you working on someone right now?
i always have a couple on the hook.  you know.  there is one right now, I have got her panting like a dog.  it is great.
what does she do?
some kinda legal secretary of something.  married to some boring jerk.
but with you, she gets to be hot, right?
red hot.  her thighs steam.
sooooo... she is pretty good in bed, then?
hey, slow down you are going to miss the turn!
see.  you and this car were meant for each other.  why fight it? sure, i have a couple other buyers lined up, but i like your style.  whattya say?  should we start on the paperwork?
let me think about it.  hold it a day for me?
dinner's in the warmer.  tell your father i may be late.
where are you going?
out.
give me the page.
what are you talking about?
it skips from page nine to eleven.  where is page ten?
aw, it is got to be a typo--
give me the goddamn page!!
what is happened?
it is serious.  that is all i can				* say.  just meet on k street under				* the key bridge.  at eight sharp.				*
she is still at my house.						*
the purse is still at the house.
immediate roll.  acquire subject at k street and key bridge.					* vehicle is red-and-white						* convertible.  you have six minutes.
roger, one.  rolling.
goddamnit, harry.  this is our butts.  so your life is in the toilet.  so your wife is banging a used car salesman.  sure it is humiliating.  but be a man here--
you tell on me, i tell on you.
whatya talking?  I am clean as a preacher's sheets, babe.  clean as a --
what about that time you trashed a six-week operation because you were busy getting a blow-job?
you know about that?
to our assignment.
what is it you need me to do?
helen, i want you to be my wife.
I am married!
just for the operation in paris. i need to be married.  they will be looking for a man traveling alone.
we are going to paris?
helen, there is a double agent in my outfit... i do not know who. there is no one i can trust. except you.  can you get away? just for two days.
i do not know.  i have to think...
here.  sit down.  be comfortable.
you see what i mean?  that reaction would give us away in a second.  try to relax.
it is just that... it is been sixteen years since anyone but harry did that, i--
relax.  there, that is better. let yourself slip into the role.
i said sit down.  who do you work for?
kettleman, barnes and mcgrath. I am a legal secretary.
of course.  mrs. tasker.  and what were you going with the international terrorist, carlos the jackal?  taking dictation?
he said he was an american agent.
how long have you been a member of his faction?
i do not know anything about a faction.  i just met simon...  or whatever his name is...  a couple of weeks ago.  i barely know him.
i should have gone to the police, i suppose.
but you didn't.  why not?
i do not know.  i guess... i wanted to see what would happen.
what did happen?
three days later, he called me. he told me to meet him at overlook park.
thank you.  you saved my life. what is your name?
helen.
you can call me simon.  you are very brave to do this...  you opened it.
i just glances inside.
why did you continue to see him?
he needed my help.
not because you were attracted to him?
no.
you were not attracted to him at all?
well, maybe a little.
is this a common thing for you? cheating?
no!  never!
so, it was your first time.
i was not cheating!
tell me about your husband, mrs tasker.
harry?  what can i say about harry?  he is a sales rep for a computer company.
would you say he was boring, then?
yeah.  i suppose he is.
that is none of your goddamn business!  what kind of questions are these?
you are in a lot of trouble, mrs. tasker, so i suggest you cooperate.  if we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you would better tell us.
my husband is a good man.
but he is not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  i mean--
let me handle this part.  do you mind?  why did you go to carlos' hideout?
he wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.
and you agreed?
yes.
why?
i do not know.  i guess i needed something...
what did you need?
i needed to feel alive.  i wanted to do something...  outrageous. and... i do not know... it felt good to be needed.  to be trusted.  to be special.
this simon.  did you sleep with him?
no.
she is lying.
you did not have sexual relations with him?
look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time.  and i have to get home to my family.
you are not going anywhere.
let me out of her!  right now!
answer the question--
she could be telling the truth.
wait!  calm down, mrs. tasker. there is only one more question.
what?
do you still love your husband?
yes.
louder please.
i love him.  i have always loved him and i will always love him.  can i go home, please?
now what?
there is only one solution to your problem, mrs. tasker.  you must work for us.
oh shit.  harry... what are you doing?
I am giving her an assignment.  i am offerring you a choice.  if you work for us we will drop the charges and you can go back to your normal life.  if not, you will go to federal prison, and your husband and daughter will be left humiliated and alone.  your like will be destroyed.
oh, gee thanks.  mmmm, let me see--
yes or no.
what do you think?  of course yes!  what is involved?
you will be contacted with the assignment.
my husband can not know about this.
no one must know!  especially him.  you must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  the security of this nation depends on it.  can you do that?
i think so.
think carefully.  you will be lying to the man you love.  the person who trusts you the most.
i can do it!
the code name of your contact will be boris.  your code name will be--
natasha?
no.  doris.
yeeaoowww!!
you son of a bitch.  did you really think you could elude us forever, carlos?
wait!  you got the wrong guy.  my name's simon.  look, just let me go.  there is no need to kill me. i have not seen your--
beat it.
no.  soon as i turn you will shoot me.
we are dead, right?  so... where did you put the transmitter?
in her walkman.  it is the one thing i knew she would be taking.
there are going to be some changes dana.  you are going to start following some rules.  and I am going to be there to see that you do.
yeah, right.
you are going to stay in school. do you understand?
why?  so i can wind up like you? what is the point?
dad, how come you know the words?
honey that song came out in 1968, when i was exactly your age.
unbelievable!  trent told me he wrote it.  he is history.
I am done.
where are you off to young lady?
i have a book report.
so last night was pretty exciting, huh?
what?  oh, the flat tire?  yeah, i thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
what?
get going!
uh... well, okay then.  you sound terrible.  I will run out right now.  just call the prescription in to the pharmacy.  sure, no problem.  bye.
allison is sick in bed.  i have to go over there, honey.
sure, hon.
you have reached a new low with this one.  i can not believe you are crazy enough to use the room at the marquis.
why not?  you think i can afford a suite like that on my salary? is jean-claude done yet?						*
now slide the nylons off one by one.
I am not wearing any.
he is got nothing to do with this. it is me you want, right?
let the hooker go.  she is not important.
harry, be quiet.  let me handle this.
what were you doing there?
you would not believe me.
hello, harry.
juno.  i wish i could say it is a pleasure to see you again.
who is your little friend?
I am helen tasker.  harry's my husband.  and you are?
so now it is tasker?  not renquist?
look, harry's not part of this. he is just a sales rep.
no, my dear, he is a federal agent.  he killed two of my colleagues the other night.
no, you do not understand, we have been married for 15 years--
harry, what is the matter with you?  tell them the truth.  we are married, we have a daughter--
i do not know what this crazy bitch is on.  you should just cut her loose, so we can get down to business.
oh yeah?  oh yeah?  then where did i get this?
who is this woman?
his wife.
his wife?  good.  bring them.
I am sorry, honey.
do not call me honey!  you do not ever get to call me honey again. you understand?!  you pig!
this is samir.  see if you can guess his specialty.
oral hygiene?
not exactly.
what is going on, harry?
samir is just going to ask harry a few questions.  see, we are not even sure which agency harry works for.  now, samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  so it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
you think i care about their					* cause?  or yours?  not at all.					* see, america is on top now .  .				* .  but so was rome, once.  all					* civilizations crumble.  one nation succeeding over another. what does it mean in the long run?  the only important thing is to live well.  and...  living					* well takes money.							*
you are damaged goods, lady.
did you tell her about us, harry?
there is no us, you psychotic bitch.
sure.  say that now.
now just keep your knees together, and you will be fine.
something you obviously have a hard time doing!
hold that thought.
what did he give you?
sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
it makes you tell the truth?
yes.
is it working yet?
ask me a question i would normally lie to.
are we going to die?
yup.										*
17 years.
my god.  have you had to...  have sex with other women in the line of duty?
i do not take those assignments.
what about juno?
she is really a fox, is not she?
did you pork her harry?
no.  but i wanted to.
are you a total lying, scumsucking pig harry?
looks that way.
what is it?
god, you have great legs.
harry... snap out of it!
tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
what?
do you still love me?
yes.
as much as you used to?
no.  much more.
if we are on an island, why are they using trucks?
we must be in the florida keys .				* .  .  the overseas highway					* connects the islands to the mainland.
what are you going to do?
go down there and kill everybody, i guess.
oh shit.
wait here.  if you have to use this, use it.  do not choke. okay?
i thought this look like your work.
let's go.  I will brief you in the air.
you are welcome.
--you tell the son of bitch this is  bright boy alert.  repeat, a bright boy alert.  and i need a patch of the white house asap. that is right--
... the coast guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  anybody that can not make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
i can get 3 marine corps harriers here in about 12 minutes. they are on maneuvers out of boca chica.
get 'em.  I will brief them on the way in.
like one?
fuck you.
... well get the highway patrol to go through the streets and tell everybody on their damn loudspeakers.  just the basics... get away from windows, do not look at it... yeah--
here they come.
any minute now.
it is show time.  do not look at					* the flash.  do not look at the flash.
I would like to remind you that it has been ten years since you were actually in one of these.
if i break it they can take it out of my pay.
he is got it.
sorry.
... you should have seen your father, standing there all covered with spaghetti sauce.  he looked like such a dope.
i told the guy---  i told the guy, this is not even my order.
i seem to remember something about a history project that is due tomorrow.
dad.  you just think you know everything, do not you?
boris and doris?
go ahead.
not yet.  but we will find him.
dance?
