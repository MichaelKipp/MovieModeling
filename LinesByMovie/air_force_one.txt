we have already been inspected.
sir, this plane carries the president of the united states.
*                     cbs said they will give us four minutes.  they thought the russian was a nice touch.
i always wondered if my freshman russian class would come in handy.
sir, you threw out page two.
goddamn right i did.  i asked for a tough-as-nails speech and you gave me diplomatic bullshit.  what is the point in having a speech if i have to ad-lib?
it was a good ad-lib, sir.
thanks.  wrote it last night.
ms.  mitchell.  so nice to finally meet you in person.
the president and i were delighted that we could accommodate you.  now if you are all cleared?  you can follow me then.
you wanna knock of f?
no, no.  I am fine.  what did the speaker say?
he and the nra do not like the wording.
apparently taking uzis away from sixth graders is not as popular as we thought it would be.  representative taylor is working on a compromise.
put together a score sheet.  I will make some calls.
with all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail stravanavitch.
i might still have a few chips left.
*                     we could always put you in a duck blind with a twelve gauge.  the second amendment types'll love that.
this is a crime bill, shep.  killing a couple ducks will not get it through committee.  besides, shep, i told you...  i do not shoot babies and i do not kiss guns.
other way around, sir.
right... christ I am tired.  do me a favor and keep me away from the press.
it is bait.  do not take it.
sir, the speaker of the house attacked this administration on national television.  you can not afford to leave that hanging.
did we tape the duke game?
up on the upper deck is the cockpit and the mission communication center. the mcc, as we call it, can place clear and secure phone calls to anywhere on earth.  we are linked to a network of military and civilian satellites and ground stations.  we could run the country or run a war from there if we had to.
this is a remarkable aircraft.
you do not know the half of it.  did you know this entire plane is shielded from radiation?  we could fly through a mushroom cloud completely unharmed if necessary.
a dubious distinction, no?
i guess it depends on your perspective.
and all these rooms here?
conference rooms, though some have other functions.  the one up front doubles as an emergency medical center.
here's a press kit.  I will let you guys get comfortable and once we are airborne I will be able to schedule the interviews.
thank you.
i said it is not worth the fight.  steward, please.
we will just say it was in bad taste.
you give me ulcers.
that is my job.
defense and state department in the conference room in one hour.  i want to review the iraq situation.
yes, sir.
it is not like he has not made us wait a few times.
well, you are not the president, dear.
yeah, no duh.
you do not want to say hi to your father?
I am sure he is busy.
do not you even want to ask?
hey joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.
alice...
mom, just this once, give it a rest.
you are jet-lagged.  we will talk about this back...
back at the fishbowl?
we will talk at home.  you know, most girls are not as lucky as you.  for most girls seeing the bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.
i know, mom.  it was great... really.
he is in a meeting.  he can not be disturbed.
I am sorry, honey.
no, it is okay.  after all, he is the president, right?
when i write my memoirs i think I will devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard air force one.
your father never means to be so...
i know...  but lotsa times i feel like it is me versus the world.  some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in bangladesh.  i mean it does not take a genius to figure which is more important.
some kids were teasing you?
that is not really the point.
you are right and I will tell you a secret.  i know exactly how you feel.
big secret.  you said the same thing to newsweek.
oooooh, I am good.
hey, you guys back already?
how was...  ...the ballet?
it was the experience of a lifetime.
how `bout a hug for the old man.
mr. president... they are ready for you in the conference room.
okay.  hey, pumpkin, you will tell me all about it later, right?
may i speak to you for a moment?
can not it wait?
no, mr. president.  it can't.
don't.  i know spin control when i feel it.
rose, i do not have time for this.
for godsakes, jim, slow down and stop acting like the little dutch boy.  not even you can plug all the world's leaks.  do not you think it is a sign you are pushing too hard when your daughter sees more of you on mtv news than in person.
she is a big girl.  she understands.
how do you know she understands? you have not spent more than five minutes with her, or me, in weeks.
and when have i had five minutes? when i wake up in the morning and I am already three hours behind schedule.  what do you want me to do, rose, tell the g7 to fuck off because I am a family man?
you know what?
what?
i miss you. and i miss her.
but that is the point, jim. we are right here.
i wish it were that easy...
I will make it up to you, i promise.
i should trust that promise? because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
this promise is not subject to congressional approval.
how did your speech go?
well, they are not burning me in effigy. that is always a good sign.
look on the bright side, hon. shep here thinks I will be a one termer.
shall i ask the chief of staff to schedule your daughter in?
our kh-ll's took this one at 0100 hours. what you see here is the mobilization of two mechanized brigades.
they have got to be joking.
the iraqi ambassador is claiming it is just an exercise.
an exercise in futility. send the nimitz back in.
the northern border's gotten a bit hairy. their migs are playing tag with our tomcats and our boys are just itching to engage.
tell our boys to cool their jets. i do not need `em creating policy for me.
what is going on?
we are under attack.
where is my family?
we are handling it, sir.
alice!
daddy...
one.
but...
two... three. go!
the rest of the secret service?
dead.
how many others killed?
nine.
any of us?
general greely says it looks like the middle east.
does your office have anything to add, mr. dean?
our only policy assumes the plane is on the ground. our hands are completely tied while they are in the air.
okay, gentlemen, we will take no action until we confirm that the president is off the plane... lee, go huddle with the d.o.d. i want an options paper on this in 20 minutes.
twenty minutes?
you heard me.  you. congress and cabinet heads.
fear will keep you alive. any one who is not afraid is bound to do something foolish, and bound to die.
what do you want with us?
cooperation. if you try to escape, you will be met with automatic gunfire and a barricade of your comrade's bodies will prevent you from exiting. good day.
he is dead then. they must have killed him.
we do not know that.
holding the president hostage is not something that slips your mind when you are making demands.
walter, if you have a point, make it.
that kid's name was jim marshall.
madame vice president. we have an options paper.  chandler takes the options paper, waves off lee, and reads it as she talks.
yes. you have made yourself quite clear.
can we do that?
we have got four hours before they make it into turkienistan airspace.
but they start executing hostages in
i hate to be pragmatic, but they will sacrifice pawns before kings. it may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.
okay. also, i want you to put our bases in turkey on alert, and have the kitty hawk prepare a retaliatory air strike.
who did this?
we checked the manifest. everyone was accounted for.
a secret service agent. it must be.
now, or he dies, please.
come on, alice.
i do not drink coffee.
you must be tired. it will wake you up.
no, thank you. the gunfire did that.
leave my daughter alone.
or you will do what, mrs. marshall?  but i admire your courage. your husband, on the other hand...
what do you know of my husband?
i know he left you behind.
my husband is a very courageous man.
your husband is a coward. he sends soldiers half-way around the world to steal a man from his home in the middle of the night.
you are one of stravanavitch's men.
so, you study world events, little one. that is good for a girl your age.
yeah, i study world events. five thousand turkienistan muslims were slaughtered in stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 american school kids. you know hqw i studied that. i went to their funerals with my dad. i met their parents.
smart for your age, eh? top of your class? tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
yeah. do you know what the word &quot;asshole&quot; means.
white house switchboard. how may i direct your call.
okay listen, listen carefully. this is an emergency call from air force one. who is there? is the vice- president there?
who can i say is calling?
this is the president.
yeah, right.
do not cut me off. this is an emergency.
sir, the president does not call this particular number. so whoever you are get a life, before i have this call traced.
you do not understand. this is an emergency. let me talk to anyone.
okay... if you are the president, when is your wife's birthday?
look lady, i do not have time for games. just put the....
thank you for calling the white house...
no. no. no. wait. wait.
remarkable aircraft. remarkable.
why did they do that?
psychology. they are trying to unnerve us.
well it worked.
mom?
yes dear?
I am sorry i was so mean to you earlier.
did they say anything about my family?
they are still alive, but the loyalists plan to start killing hostages in forty minutes.
then tell me there is a rescue operation underway.
and if that means negotiating...
you know my policy. we do not negotiate with terrorists. if we start now, all of america becomes a target.
but this is different, sir. you are the president.
please, mr. president. you are going to get yourself killed. is that your solution?
freeing stravanavitch is going to get tens of thousands killed. i can not live with that.  I am not royalty. I am an elected official and the integrity of the office of the president is infinitely more important than the man who holds that office.  we do not negotitate. not as long as I am president. is that understood?
*                     please tell me your name.
maria... maria mitchell.
and what is it you do, ms. mitchell.
I am responsible for press relations for the flight office.
how are your fellow hostages feeling, ms. mitchell?
scared. we are scared.
you are pointing a gun at me.
very good. thank you, ms. mitchell.
do you have to be so brutal?
yes
why? do you enjoy it?
i neither enjoy nor dislike. i do what is necessary.
how can you? i mean they are people.
but they are not ny people. you look at me as if i am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of iraq, did you cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who is faces you will never see? did you cry for their wives and children. they were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
that was war.
so is this.  come now, you are upsetting the little one.
the woman you shot. she was my friend.
that is the way of the world, little one. did not they teach you that in school?
do you see the maintenance panel?
got it.
pop it open. there should be a red switch, toggle it up.
okay, it is on. we have got some indicator lights here.
okay, you are aerated. to dump the fuel you have to close the circuit for the pump. there is no switch in avionics so you will have to cross the wires. there should be five wires, just to your left. do you see them?
it is cut.
cross it...  the static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
how?
avionics compartment! it is the only place. you better get zedeck down there fast unless, of course, you would rather be a martyr than a savior.
go! take serge.. and watch your backs.
we have stopped dumping... but we have only got about twenty minutes of fuel left.
we are not going to make it.
not even close. hell, we can not even make syria or iraq.
where are we now?
over the black sea. i can probably get us to turkey or georgia.
no! if we land this plane anywhere else, we will end up another entebe.  the americans built a super plane that flies through mushroom cloud, evades missiles and...  refuels in mid-air. call the white house.
finally, we can bargain.
I am sure we can strike some sort of arrangement. land the plane and we will trade you hostages for fuel.
shall i begin by executing the president's daughter? she is right here.
no.
say something dear.
fuck off, you stupid asshole.
it would be a pity to squander such a strong personality.
mr. president, how the hell did you get on board?
i never left. where is my wife and daughter?
mr. caidwell, the ground's a few miles away. how do you propose getting us from here to there?
gravity.
we have already played our cards, major. there is no turning back.
we can not jump from here or at this speed. but if we could get a message out - tell the refueling plane...
they have cut communication, and i spent a good bit of time looking for alternatives. my only solution ran out of batteries.
the fax machines.
excuse me?
the fax machines.
no good. i said they disabled the communications system.
no. i thought about this, mr.
get `em ready.  you... come with me.
eighteen thousand feet, sir. and two hundred knots... otherwise it is suicide.
got it.
where are we sending it?
white house situation room.
someone should give you a raise.
actually, sir, you could be that someone.
nor will there be. my husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
you will be the first to pay for that mistake.
I will not going without my family.
yes, sir.
air force one, this is af-135-ra. we have been instructed to refuel your plane.
about goddamn time.
please change course to zero seven four and drop to eighteen thousand feet. over.
air force one, acknowledged.  tnt. emergency parachute launch ramp.
air force one, please reduce speed to 250 knots.
roger.
that is affirmative.
ga get it.
sir, we stay with the president.
that is not necessary.
they still have the president, it is past their deadline and they have not called. what do you think it means?
like any good poker player, they are checking over their hand seeing which cards to play and which to discard.
he did not leave us.
you are a resilient man, mr.
special agent gibbs. you helped do this?
yes, mr. president.
why?
because it is my duty.
you are duty to what? the country you served does not exist anymore.
my loyalty was never to my country.
now since we have had very little luck getting washington or moscow to cooperate, i wondered if you would be so kind.
over my dead body.
no. but since i only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps i will start with your family instead... gibbs.
the world is such a dangerous place and we can not always protect our children.
please. you can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
she is not a part of this. this is between you and me.
call up petrov and order stravanavitch' s release.
this administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
pity. mr. gibbs.
daddy...
alice... i...
daddy. daddy, please...
jim... for godsake!
four...
jim...
three...
stop.
you will do it?
yes, I will do it.  just leave my family alone.
good. good.
someday, you will regret my nature.
you do not like seeing people get hurt. now in morality, that is a virtue. in politics, however, that is weakness.  you were a hostage to everyone else *                    long before you were a hostage to
i do not know why you stayed.
please... do not start with me.
you got what you wanted. you going to release us now?
you are very valuable. and our nation needs so many things.
the taste of defeat is bitter, no?
one thing I have learned as
shepherd.
sir...
call petrov...  I will be back.
both of you.
they are not answering their hails.
this does not make sense.
if challenged, our fighters are to state that they are on a rescue mission.
iraqi's will not buy it. either they are already in on this or they will think we are spying.
if fired upon, tell our fighters that they are ordered to engage.
how you doing, sweetie?
been better, dad... you?
there goes your ride.
let my daughter go or I will take you out!
if you put down the gun, i promise not to drop her on the way down.
no you won't. you will compromise... like always.
hold on, alice.
oh ny god... oh my god... oh my god...
it is okay, honey. i got you. i got you. you are okay.
the americans say they are escorting a damaged plane. our pilots confirm they are surrounding a 747.
did we warn them off?
yes. they refused to alter course and the 747 would not answer our hails.
it is some kind of trick... a preliminary airstrike in response to our troop movement.
they are in our airspace. we would be within our rights.
the world would not look on us kindly if we shot down a civilian airliner.
the pilot says it is does not have the markings of a commercial jet.
warn then again. if they do not respond... shoot them down. we will not be intimidated.
my god. i think that was a mig.
a mig? where the hell are we?
iraq, sir. we are over iraq.
iraq? shep, you are fired.
shit.
how long's it been since you flew, sir?
twenty-five years.
what are you doing?
flying the plane.
you have not even driven a car since you took office.
u.s. pilots, this is air force one.
copy air force one. welcome to the party.
mr. president, it is an honor. now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
you read my mind.
put your pilot on.
he is busy being dead.
who is flying the fucking plane?
I am doing what i can.
two and three are heading toward the boeing.
okay. we are going to arc a fat one to the right. got it?
got it.
stay cool.
how we doing, colonel?
we still got three migs running around and six more on the way.
uh, we got a problem here.
just stay on my wing, sir. I will take you all the way in.
no. we are losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
lemme take a look.
aw, man. you are torn up pretty bad out here, sir. do you have any elevater control.
sluggish... i think it is jammed too.
uh, tower, we got a problem up here.
they have got no chutes. they can not control the plane, their engines are failing and they are losing fuel.
i prefered the terrorists.
that is game, set, and match. there is nothing to do, except call the chief justice.
the chief justice? what on earth for?
to swear you in as president.
twenty five minutes. they should be here any moment.
they better. fuel's almost gone.
there they are!
okay, I am slowing us down.
it is open!
do you see teem?
we are hooked!
we are hooked. hove into position.
tower, air force one has been boarded.
romeo tango zulu, copy one the television, graphics of the first family against the presidential seal.
romeo tango zulu, do you have the president? over.
stand by.
romeo tango zulu1 this is tower.
we copy. stand by...  tower?
tower, here.
this is romeo tango zulu changing call signs.  tower, alert air traffic, romeo tango zulu is now air force one.  this is air force one... the president is safe onboard.
copy, air force one.
