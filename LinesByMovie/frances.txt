bye, baby.
see you next weekend, dad.
and do you think it is radical for a man to have a job and feed a family?
no!
is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children?
no!
is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country?
no! no!
good! because, brothers, that is you!
momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?  hey!
do not touch me.
I am not going to hurt you. i just wanna talk.
okay then...
well... you are causin' trouble, you know that?
I am causing trouble?! you are a pain in the butt! you newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since i won that dumb contest. I am just sixteen, you know? who the hell cares what i think?
not me. but other people seem to.
yeah. well if you did not put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
now wait a minute, sweetie. do i look like a newshound to you?
no... actually, you look more like a cop.
i'll... take your word for it. so who are you, then?
harry york. i work for martoni kaminski, he is running for congress here.
oh yeah! i saw you in the newsreel!
yeah, well --
you know, my dad's done some work for kaminski...
now you are catchin' on. do not wanna get your daddy in hot water, do you?
whattaya mean?
well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist --
but I am not. the newspapers're --
right again. you are no more an atheist than my man's a red, but what they are doin', see, they are addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. could look bad for your daddy.
yeah. could look bad for you and kaminski too, i guess.
sure do not talk like you are sixteen.
well are not you the smoothie. now you are going to ask for my number, i suppose.
i suppose not. gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
well... I will give it a try, mr. york.
harry.
harry.
it always amazes me, lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
i can thank you for that. it was a hard-earned talent.
bread?
thank you.
when is the last time you saw a hundred dollars, ernest farmer?
mama...
I am not hungry. you two just enjoy yourselves. after all, this is a celebration.
i'm... I am really proud of you, frances.
thanks, dad.
an essay contest... a national contest. that is pretty impressive.
i did not have much to do with it.
you wrote it, did not you?
yeah, i suppose... dad, who is harry york?
well, harry york is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. why do you ask?
he talked to me today. told me to keep my mouth shut or I would get everybody in trouble.
yeah... well... it is possible. harry york and i both work for mr. kaminski right now, and... well... there are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. that is the way of things, but mr. kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.
is kaminski a communist?
no, no, no. all he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.
he is a socialist, then?
it is already started, dad... with me.
i know.
and i can not understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more i tried to explain --
do not listen to him, little sister. when you are proud of what you are, you do not refuse the label, understand?
yes, ma.
and you... should be proud. you won that contest and made a name for yourself.
you are poisoning that child's mind.
i have a right to talk to her. she is my daughter, and she is beginning to understand why I have sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
you have sacrificed?! if you would practice law for decent folk instead of communists and indigents --
they need help, lil. they pay me back in other ways.
how? what do they do for you, kaminski and his friends? they are all anarchists! traitors!
no, lil. it is just you can not understand their brand of patriotism.
that is right. i can not understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure.
I am going back to the hotel.
good.
see you next weekend?
as usual. everything as usual, mr. farmer. just give me my due.
lillian... I am more than willing to meet you halfway.
do not make me sick. I would sooner drown myself in puget sound.
that is a thought, lil. that sure is a thought.
dad, please, do not leave early. just because of mama --
francie, you will learn that sometimes it is best to stay low and just walk away.
this is the answer: a subscription drive to "voice of action!" first prize is a trip to moscow! you could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet stanislavski!
but I will never win that.
yes, yes, it is all arranged. everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. and the best part is: the trip returns you to new york.
really?
new york, frances! broadway! this is your chance! you belong on the stage!
thank you.
hi, harry. did you see the play?
you think I would miss it?
well? what did you think?
i just wanted to see how you looked.
how did i look?
enh.
do not be a rat, harry.
you looked okay.  joint's pretty dead. how 'bout i take you home?
honest. when you were up there, you were really... there, know what i mean? everyone else looked stupid.
i do not know... i did... feel different... alive.
yeah, it is a gift. you got to do something with it.
yeah, but if i win this trip, mama'll kill me. she hates russians. i do want to go, though... to new york, especially... but i wanted to do it...
what?
quietly.
you are not the quiet type, frances.
you know, my old man was an inventor. spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. well, i was supposed to be his partner. when i told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, i thought he was going to die right there.
what happened to him?
he retired to florida... made a killing in vending machines.
i kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, i would have been miserable living his life.
...so you think i should go.
sure. try this acting thing. you can make good money at it.
i do not know, harry. i... i want so many...
you do not know what you want.
yeah.
frances...
what?
well... do not you think it is up to me to...
come on, harry. this is america, land of the free.  i thought we might go skinny dipping.  for starters.
but they are using you!
oh ma, they are not using me. it is just a chance to travel, see things. besides, it is the only way i can get to new york.
I will pay your way to new york. I will work, I will slave. I will sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --
oh, mama, do not you understand?
it is not in your hands, mama. it is my life.
yes, but important people are concerned about this. judge hillier spoke to alma styles --
i do not care.
...you will.
what do i do, dad?
you really want to go?
of course.
and you think it is worth all this?
if i didn't, i would not put you through it.
...then go.
i love you, mama.  i love you, dad.
be careful, francie.
good morning, mr. bebe!
who is this?
frances farmer, contract player, six- month option.
okay. good tits. can not we show them off a little more?
i guess so, sir.
very fine bone structure.
kurt!
oh, angela! go with these trappers! they will lead you safely down the mountain...
but, kurt, i...
no, no arguments. be my good girl and go. there is a forest, a burning forest, and you know what i have to do!
oh, kurt!
oh angela, my own... angela!
how ya doin', farmer?
me? look at you! what are you doing in hollywood?
came to get a tan.
not bad. but come on, harry; what is the real reason?
kaminski.
yeah, i read about that. terrible business, suicide.
since when do you believe the papers? they killed him, kid.
what?
they killed him. they threw him out that window.
oh no...
eight stories.
jesus.
yup. poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk and he could not die. too god damn much heart. he just did not want to die.
but... but why, harry...? why did they do it?
he would not play ball. what can i tell ya... it is done.  anyway, i did not want to be next, so i skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. tail and nail job.  I am sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  how d'ya like the camouflage?
you jackass!  c'mon, let's get out of here.
not bad. it was slow at first, but I am doing bits now.
i always told ya, frances. you got real ability.
i know what ability you are interested in.
hey, I am a man, are not i? whattaya say we have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off each other.  for old time's sake.
harry... i met someone.
yeah? what is he -- muscleman? lifeguard?
serious, huh?
yeah.
hey that is great, farmer, just great.
that is frances. I am not the cookbook.
you see: we have got to change that name.
i like your looks. you have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... garbo, dietrich --
thank you --
i intend to make a great deal of money off you.
since we have you on a seven year contract, I am planning long-range. I am going to loan you out to sam goldwyn to make a picture called "come and get it."
really? that is a very good book. it would make a terrific --
never mind that. I am concerned about you. your attitude.
society is falling apart, miss farmer, and people have to buckle down, do their jobs. you see, i view myself as the henry ford of motion picture industry, and i can not have the fellow who puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now can i?
but I am concerned with everything, mr. bebe.
no, I am concerned with everything.
but I am the one up there on the screen.
that is right. you are an actress, miss farmer and your job is to act.
it is okay.
smile, little sister, smile.
on behalf of the seattle ladies club, as a token of our vast admiration --
excuse me.
yes...?
do not i know you?
i do not believe so.
sure. you shouted at me in the auditorium when i read my essay.
no, my dear. you must be mistaken.
oh bullshit.
shit. i meant the other way around.
well, the studio told me not to.
is that why you did it?
who ever thought they would be right for once? jesus, harry... it is a zoo back there --
you are telling me.
dick... and my mother! she acts like she is on mars or something --
well, she is back to earth now. they are all pretty huffed up about your leaving. i think you better go back, kid.
forget it.
you know, the funny thing is: it is not a great movie. i mean it could have been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. and all my friends, i know they are going to smile and say they loved it.
if they say they love it, they will probably love it. not everybody lies, you know?
no, they don't, do they?
frances, you are a movie star now. if you give them what they want, you can get anything.
i do not have what they want, harry.  harry, will you tell me something? how can i keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
some people starve, kid. until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. makes 'em feel better.
but i do not want to be like that. i want to do something...
what are you going to do, waste your talent? why not use it to make something worthwhile. you can do that, you know?
yeah, if i do not make too big an ass of myself.
tell you what. let's ditch the limo. let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up chevy.
the hell you will, harry york.
come on, cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.
do not start, farmer.
it is midnight, harry. my glittering raiments are dissolving.
the chauffeur. he is watching.
he deserves a show. he missed the movie.
I am serious, frances. this is important.
i know.
hi frances, got a minute?
sure, claire. if you do not mind walking my way.
well, i suppose i should just say it. it is your clothes.
my clothes?
yeah, i mean slacks... and work clothes... and that awful car --
it is a perfectly good car. it runs.
yes, but... really, i hate to sound... it is just that the public expects something different from its stars. people will not take you seriously.
i do not care if my clothes are taken seriously. or my car.
you know what i mean.
uh-huh. you mean what if the public finds out i perspire? and wear slacks. and drive an old jalopy? what if they find out I am a real person. oh no! say it am not so! not a real person!
that is not all, frances. mr. bebe is very concerned about your politics. he hears you have been donating money, speaking at rallies.
yup. claire... please, please tell mr. bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we would make a lot better movies.
I am sorry, frances. it is my job, you know?
i know.  'this is a factory and we each have our jobs. the writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
...acts. I will relay your message.
you learn your lines?
sort of.
there've been some calls.
who?
well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what is her name?
claire?
yeah, claire. she said she was fired. too bad, huh?
fired?
yeah. she said she delivered your message and that you would understand.
there was another call too. from your agent. he says your summer stock deal is all set. so you are going back east, huh?
...yes.
without me.
showdown.
you were not going to tell me, were you? just pack up and leave, is that it?
dick, we need some time apart --
hey, I am not a complete fool, you know. i can see you are going sour on me, and when i try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it is nothing.
dick, i can not even breathe here...
dwayne! I am dwayne now! and you damn well better get used to it!
dick...
i do not suppose it occurred to you that i might want to leave too, that i might want to do theatre? no, 'cause you do not want me along, do you? and the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
no?
no. it is all about that night, is not it?
what night?
the premiere. i never pressed you about it but god damn it, you are going to tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
you want his name?
the group is more than a theatre company. it is the embodiment of an ideal. our approach allows the actor to be an artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of change. you see --
really, mr. clurman, you do not have to sell me.
forgive my indulgence. seems we always lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. the point is, mr. odets here has written a wonderful play. most of the roles are cast, but we have not found our female lead...
who is she?
and what is the title of this seduc... assault?
'golden boy.'
that is me, clifford.
i know, but I am not seeing it. it is there, frances, the fire is there, but it is not coming through. you are lazy --
I am not!
yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you do not set them on fire!
but i want to. I am trying!
i need an incendiary! an arsonist!
then show me! that is what I am here for, to learn, to grow!
good. then it is very simple. you have to stop being afraid, frances. it is in you.
...not only an artist, but an instrument of change. we must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. we will not stand idly by as fascist bombs obliterate democracy. we contribute our profits, for if fascism is not stopped in spain, it will spread across europe, jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.  the artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.
I am not afraid of struggle, clifford.
face it! confess it! you are weak!
I am not!
you are afraid!
I am not!
you do not want to show your whole soul -- ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful -- you do not want to show it --
god damn it, clifford, will you shut up! i tell you, i want to give these things! i want to give them to the audience, and i can give them, i will give them, so shut up!
good, good. give them that.
what?
madam...?
thank you.
oh my god! frances, I am such a cad. i can not go through with this. my wife is in europe, but this is her house...  her bedroom. i can not ask you to...
oh well. i guess i better leave then.
okay, but come here first.
huh.
come here. i want to show you something.
and on top of her political activities, now she is got a lawyer. she wants out of her contract, mr. bebe. she says she is through with motion pictures.
I am sure it was not me, it was not me...
excuse me, sir?
i do not know who she fucked to get where she is, but i do not think it was me.
well... you could always dump her, mr. bebe. teach her a lesson. there are a million beautiful girls out there who do not give a damn about politics.
that is not the point. frances farmer has the world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can waltz off without a thank you. no. no, that young lady has a contract, and she is going to honor it.
oh. i mean, good.
i think it is time to take the gloves off.  get me some reporters.  particularly louella parsons!
I am really sad it is closing. now what am i going to do on tuesday nights?
you can always come see it in london.
only if you were in it. are you?
i would not miss it.
boy, I would love to... but I am going to hollywood.
are you an actor?
hell yes!... well, okay, I am still in school. but as soon as i graduate... california, here i come!
are you really serious? about acting?
why... yes.
then do not go to hollywood.
why?
I am telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. it will crush you.
you sound as if you hate it.
no, i do not hate it.
are not you ever going back?
...not if i can help it.
gosh! you will break a lot of hearts.
they will mend.
what about your husband?
what?
will you be getting back together? when you quit hollywood, i mean.
what is this?
is it true you are getting a divorce? comrade?
why, you... you little bastard!
just one minute...
you are wasting your time, lady. nothing's off the record with me.
'but how do i know you love me?'
your big speech?
'how do i know it is true? you will get to be the champ. they will all want you, all the girls! but i do not care. I have been undersea a long time. when they would put their hands on me i used to say, "this is not it! this is not what i mean!" it is been a mysterious world for me! but joe, i think you are it! i do not know why, i think you are it. take me home with you.'
i already have.
how is it sound?
the speech? real good.
you think i got it?
you got it.
yeah. yeah, tonight i think i got it.
hello, harold.
frances.
where is clifford?
he is not here.
oh.
what is up?
i hear you are meeting with the studio lawyers to get out of your contract.
that is right. i do not want them breathing down my neck while we are in london.
well... well, you see, that is the point. you will not be opening in london.
you do not think I am good enough?
what?! good lord no, it is just... it is money. we needed backing and... well, we found it.
who?
an actress.
a rich actress.
yes. that is the deal. she plays lorna.
but... but wait a minute. we are supposed to be different, right? clifford says... this theatre is supposed to be different! and this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
i know, but --
what does clifford say?
right now we have to be practical.
does clifford even know?  you did not tell him, did you?  I am going to tell him. where is he?
he knows, frances.
harry? harry, where are you?!
jesus, frances, how did you find me?
i called your god-damned office! i want you to kill him, harry. you will do that for me, will not you? i loved him, i loved him... that bastard.
calm down, frances.
do not tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter!
two lines! two fucking lines! 'my wife returns from europe tomorrow. i can not see you any more.' just like that!
frances...
harry, i hate being in love. i do not ever want to be in love again. i just hate it!
look, mr. bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can not break me. I am back, and I am going to make the best of it.
I would like nothing better.
well... come on.
this is a mistake. no. this is a disaster.
come on, it is just what you need! let everyone see you. talk to them, live it up!
but we have been at it since six this morning. at least you could have let me go home and change.
look, frances, i did not want this job. think I am crazy? but you begged me: improve your image. so please... lemme try, huh?
you are right. I am sorry.  okay, let's go get 'em.
here, take a few of these. studio makes 'em in the basement. they keep the fat off.
so not only am i a troublesome bitch, but I am fat too?
come on. they make you feel nice and peppy.
frances?  oh no.
refill my drink, will you, bob?
what are you doing?
putting on my armor.
come on, frances. louella parsons is here. she wants to talk to you, help you out.
louella... did not she call me a spoiled little bitch?
come on, she is an important columnist! what is the matter? i thought you wanted these people to forgive you.
'forgive'...? for what?
I am sorry... that was an unfortunate choice of words.
hey, where is the fire, sister?
in my eyes, officer.
cool off, beautiful. did not you see the sign says "dimout zone?"  there is a war on, you know?
come on. you are seriously trying to tell me the japs can not find los angeles without my headlights?
i did not make the law, lady. i just enforce it.
how the hell do you find me anyway?
animal magnetism!  no ginger beer. what is this red stuff?
what is left of my blood.
think I will have a glass.
help yourself. everyone else has.
nice joint. can you afford it?
nope. the studio pays. thank you, harry.
what for?
for not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
well, i would have, you know? i just did not know how to cook it.
six months' probation...? you got to learn when to do battle, farmer. you are not going to win many bouts with 200 pound cops.
i took the early rounds.
I will bet.
i do not know. it hurts, harry. some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
so you drink, and you fight with a cop...?
yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what is going on inside their heads. sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. and you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
beats me.
hey look, i got some business down in san diego. whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?
no, harry, i can not --
you are coming.
i just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. and i could say: i did that, i made something good.
and?
well... to get a crack at something good, you got to earn it, you got to climb the ladder first. so you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. and then one day you realize you are, you are at the top... and there is nothing there. and you look behind you and there is no one below. you are just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze.
take a walk, pal.
who said i was a lady?
what happened? who are you?
who are you?
i live here.
you are farmer? oh... well, look, they took your stuff out. moved it to some hotel, i think.
what?
I am preparin' it for the next tenant, he is coming in tomorrow.
get your clothes on.
you have no right! you have no fucking right, you bastards! get the hell out of here --
get your clothes on, lady --
get out!
you are under arrest.
name?
i do not believe this! you jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you do not even know who the hell i am!
age?
fifteen.
address?
just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. come on, this is a joke! assault and battery? i barely touched that bitch!
occupation?
...is that not true?
who is writing this guy's lines?
answer the question! have you driven a car since you were placed on probation?
no, i could not get my hands on one.
have you reported to your probation officer as directed?
i never saw him. why did not he show up?
did you expect him to look you up?
why, certainly. i wanted to get a peek at his face...
you are on your way to a contempt citation, young lady.
that is fine with me...  get it? fine. a fine! hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
miss farmer, is it true you fought with the policeman who arrested you last night?
sure it is true. i was fighting for my country as well as myself.
miss farmer, you were advised at the last hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a law-abiding citizen --
miss farmer! in light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the plaintiff here... i am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the county jail.
fine!
you are a deeply troubled young lady... i only hope you change your course before it is too late.
it is alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
mama, what's...
shhh, shhh. you are not going to jail, frances. the judge has put you under my care. I will see you get the rest you need.
you are taking me home!
i find these initial meetings to be much easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.
am i supposed to say 'thank you'?
thanks are hardly necessary.
aw, shucks, ma'am. t'weren't nothin'.
I am glad to see you have not lost your sense of humor.
it am not for lack of trying.
so it seems. may we be serious for a moment?
why, doctor! we have only just met!
oh! are you really?
among persons such as yourself, creative people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and certainly nothing to be ashamed of. it is just that the neuroses which fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities which...
do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than i do?
please sit down...
you may discuss my predicament, doctor. you may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I am not interested. i can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
i see.
besides, i do not want to be what you want to make me.
and what is that?
normal. average.
all right. will you please sit down now?  symington says.
...did you really say that?
just a little joke, miss farmer.
this whole thing is a joke!
stay calm, please.
no, you stay calm, doctor! but you are finding that difficult, are not you?  why, are you attracted to me? perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better...  and you have torn my personality to shreds, and I am weeping and vulnerable...  then you will really get your kicks, will not you, "doctor?"
I will have someone show you to your room.
oh, that is good, very professional. in control. but the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.
is there something else?
you did not say 'symington says'.
tell them who i am! tell them who i am!
are you crazy? unhand that woman! that is amelia earhart!
and here's one from nice mr. zeiss. he says that...
why are these all opened?
well, they needed immediate answers, frances. it is good manners and good sense. you should not be bothering yourself with these right now.
then why did you bring them?
it is your fan mail, little sister.
you kill me, mama.
what?
go on...
...i'm sorry to keep you waiting, the staff review ran over. did you enjoy your mother's visit?
yes. it was very good to see her.
really? any problems?
not at all. she brought me my fan mail.  i had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. but i guess that is the best thing about working in the movies. you make so many friends. i want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me was not a mistake.
you are telling me you feel guilty.
no... what i mean is... I am just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that is all.
do you really believe your mother's trying to kill you?
what?
she told me you said, "mama, you want to kill me."
i never said... oh look. that is just a figure of speech. she said something funny, and i said...
and you accused her of tampering with your mail.
oh for christ's...
I am sorry. she misunderstood, that is all.
but you tell me you had a pleasant visit and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. whom do you think i should believe?
doctor, i hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
frances, you are still filled with anxiety. you feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends. consequently, i did not recommend your release at the staff review.
you what?
mental illness is an elusive thing, and though I am pleased you are feeling more... capable, it is perhaps unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time. do not you agree?
I am sure you will see it my way in the end.
dr. symington, how big is your dick?
huh?
'cause if it is long enough, which i doubt, why do not you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
i want outta here, you understand? I am ready to get out! so you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!
frances, I am warning you...
no, I am warning you! who do you think you are, god? you bumble around with your folders...  ...and your pencils...  ...and your god-damn buttons...  ...all your badges of authority! but you have no authority! you are nothing! you are a zero!
symington says...
sedate her.
oh my god, i look awful.
you have looked a whole lot better. c'mon.
evening, gorgeous.
that sure looks like fun...  you know how long it is been since i was behind the wheel?
forget it, frances. you are not driving.
have i told you how mean you are turning, york?
where are we, mean man?
couple hours from idaho. we will cut across to montana. I have got friends there with a ranch.
i should have known...
what?
this is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
that is right.
...take advantage of me.
i do not think I would be much good in a war...
whattaya think you are in now?
i do not know. not a war exactly. it is more a... a misapprehension maybe...
huh?
a misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. i was not declaring war, harry. i was just saying my prayers.
harry, i have to go home. i have to talk to mama.
frances, you are fulla drugs. you do not know what you are saying. who do you think put you into meadow wood? your mother thinks you are crazy and she will keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
no, she just did not want me going to jail, that is all.
yeah? she is a shark, frances. I am not taking you there, and that is that!
you know something, harry?
i guess.
aside from meanness, you are almost perfect. there is only one other thing wrong with you.
what is that?
you can not drink.
ohhh, that is lousy scotch!
hey! another shot for the lady and a double for me!
what a man!
hey, you are a good quarter-horse, kid, but you can not go a route of ground.
to quarter-horses.
no. to thoroughbreds.
why are you always leaving me, harry?
huh?
you should stickaround sometimes. look out for me.
look, frances, I am only going to ask this one time. i mean it. i swear after this, I will never ask again: will you marry me?
i know a thing or two about marriage. you... you understand me more than anyone, harry... maybe even more than mama. but... you are too important to me. I would fail you. i do not know how or why, but i would. and that is a chance i just can not take. do you understand?
well... I will act like i do until i do.
there is just one more thing.
what is that?
will you marry me?
it is not too late to keep going, up to vancouver? be the smartest thing.
thanks, harry, really, but... i can not explain it. she is my mother. she is just... i can not give up on her that easy.
you give up on her?
yeah. it is just... something i got to do, i guess.
frances, you are crazy.
i know. do not tell anyone.
anyway... if you need me...
i got your number, mister man.
well, who have we here...?
frances, you remember my lawyer, alma styles?
oh mama, I am so... tired of that song.
please. i want you to. it would make me so happy.
i think i need a little air.
what is wrong?
nothing. i think I will just go out for awhile.
where are you going?
for a walk, mama. just a walk.
how long will you be?
not long.
I will have lunch ready by one.
I will be back.
at one. promise?
sure.
say you promise.
i promise i'll... i promise, mama.
you know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
yes, mama.
i do not want you drinking, frances.
yes, mama.
...so what do you think?
i do not know, honey. your mother has such big plans for you.
i know that, dad, but --
what you have to understand, francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... the only time i ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... i do not know.
but dad, I am asking about me. what do you think i should do?
well, francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just does not look the same. then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it is all you have got... or just let it go. this is the way of things, but i guess you already know that.
dad... whatever i decide, will it be okay with you?
always. always.
I am sorry, i... i do not have a desk in my room, and...
i do not care, dad. i love you.
i love you too, francie.
I am back, mama.
oh frances, do i have news for you! guess who --
wait, mama, wait. i have something to tell you. I have decided... well... I am not going to make movies anymore. i thought that is what i wanted, and i went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but i was miserable, mama, and it nearly killed me. so now... now it is over. i want a different kind of life, something... simple. i want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and I will have dogs and cats -- i feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... it is going to be okay, mama, i know it. and i love you.
don't... talk crazy.
mama...?
they want you back! your agent called today! do not you understand? he is sending the scripts. he wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people! frances, you can not do this to your fans! why, they have been praying for you all through this nightmare. you can not turn your back on them now! look at this fan mail I have been answering!
have not you heard what i said?
i told him to come up! i told him you wanted to show them all that there is nothing wrong with you any more, that you are completely cured!
I am not cured. i was never sick! they had no business putting me in there! my only responsibility is to myself now!
you... you selfish, selfish child. at least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
no!
you want to throw it all away, is that it? you had everything, little sister. beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. you were a movie star!
mama, shut up!
and now you are throwing everything away? you are going to be a nobody! nobody! you know what that is like?!
you... you would send me back, would not you? you would.
where are you going?
I am going out!
you are not going anywhere!
yes, i am, and you can not stop me! you can not tell me what to do, mother. I am a grown woman, and i can decide about my own life.
frances!
doctor, it may sound odd, but i believe I have profited from my stay here. it is just what I have needed, to get away like this. but I am recuperated now. I have had lots of time to think and I have made a few decisions about my life. I am ready to get on with it.
i know you believe that.
...don't you?
I am afraid not. you see, we observe things that you are unaware of: signs, indicators. your problem cuts very deep, frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you will really feel secure. does that make sense?
no. cut this runaround, doctor. i know better.
listen to yourself, frances. the resistance, the anger in your voice.
you... I am sorry, forgive me. doctor, tell me honestly, what do i have to do to get out of here?
be patient, that is all. take an interest in your treatment and do not dwell on your resentments. you will be yourself again, i assure you.
...i see.
we will talk more about this. I will see you later.
one question. if I am not myself now, just who do you think i am?
frances! frances!
who?
frances, it is me, harry?
...touch me again and I will kill you, you pig.
oh, god! let's get her out of here tonight, right now! let's take her with us!
the hearing's tomorrow. if she gets out legally, they can not come after her.
look at her! she will never pass that sanity test tomorrow...
I am taking care of that, harry. just hold her.  reserpine. i guarantee you this'll clear her head. she will wake up feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.
let's get out of here! I will lose my job!
frances, we got to do it this way. just remember tomorrow, remember what i told you. what are you going to tell 'em?
harry!
i gotta go now.
we are all square now, harry. right?
all square, doc.
good. 'cause i do not want to see you again.
i love you, harry. i love you.
i love you too, frances.
of course, she has not anything definite in mind.
no. no, it all depends on what offers i get.
oh, just leave those things for now.
no, mama, I will take care of it. I will wash them in the morning.
you know, little sister, i never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. i knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
thank you for understanding, mama.
little sister, i do not want you to feel any rush to get back to work. i want you to rest... for a while anyway.
i will, i promise.
where to?
oh harry...
this is it, kid. this is our chance. when you got a chance, you better take it.
yeah. i do not know.
you do not need to screw around anymore. you do not need dwayne steele or odets or your mother. you need me.
i know, but... there were so many people in there, harry. every time i turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. when i feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
been a lot of years, you know. a long time waiting. for what? end up feeling like a sap.
oh please, harry... do not even think it. you are the only person who ever... it is just... can not you wait for me?
i do not know.
yes you do. if you love me you can wait, right? a month, six months, whatever it takes.
right. except... time has a way of --
no, harry, it is not time, it is us. you and me. and I am telling you now that I will come to you, okay? I will find you. i will.
i hope so, frances.
pretty morning.
it is always beautiful at this time. peaceful...
and no people.
yes.
where you goin'?
wherever they are going, I am going.
yeah, i know what that is like... where you been?
well, i was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
yeah.
what did you do?
you know, I have never been able to figure that out.
shit!
run!
francie, you know i can not do that.
why? it is such a simple thing. you just let me out and i disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
they will just catch you again, francie. besides, your mother will know.
dad, here! you do not have to stop, just slow down. you can tell mama i jumped out. she knows that is the kind of thing I would do. she will not blame you.
but i gave her my word. besides, she is still your legal guardian. my hands are tied.
you know where you are taking me. you know what she will do. just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
please, francie...
daddy!
are you... are you hungry?
i pity us, dad. i pity us both.
do i go right away or do i have time to take a bath?
i was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
you were hoping for a kind word?! you are my mother! you are supposed to nourish me! support me!
i have!
no! all you have done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! but I am not you, mother, and i never will be, and thank god for it!  that goes for you too! and frankly, i do not know how, with the two of you, i turned out as sane as i am --  wait right there, gentlemen, I will be with you in a minute... and believe me, i do not want to stay here one second longer than i have to!  but I have got to tell you, lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you have done and hang your head in shame. in shame!
but what --
no! you are not talking now. you listen. you can send me away, lillian, you can pretend I am crazy and pretend I am still your little girl who can not take care of herself, but one thing you can not pretend anymore. you can not pretend i love you because i don't. i can't. not after what you have done to me. because you see... I am still me... I am trying real hard all this time to be me... and you, 'little sister', you have not been any help at all.  okay, boys, I am ready.
i do not know why they even bother. she is had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
yeah?
i checked the files. this one holds the record for shock treatments. four hundred seventeen and no end in sight.
you are kidding.
yeah, well, you know doctors. they sure hate to use that word.
what?
'incurable.'
harry? oh harry, i knew you would come. i love you, harry. i love... take me home, harry.
we will get you home, frances.
thank you, harry.
...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. were you mentally ill, frances?
...no, ralph. i do not believe i ever was sick. but when you are treated like a patient long enough, you are apt to act like one...
were you an alcoholic?
no.
were you a drug addict?
no. never.
thank you, ralph.
thank you, frances. and after the show we are hosting a reception for you and your friends at hollywood's own roosevelt hotel!
c'mere. i want to talk to you.
oh. why, harry york. how nice to see you.
how... how ya doin', farmer?
fine, thank you. did you watch the show?
sure i did, that is why I am here.
how did i look?
oh, you...  ...ennh.
well... you are looking well.
i got a new car. only it is red. did you know mama died?
yeah. yeah, i heard about that.
dad, too. i sold the house. I am a faceless sinner, harry...
why do you say that?
I would ask you to take me home, but I am a faceless sinner.  ...you smell good, harry. familiar, you know? I would ask you to take me home, but...
it is going to be slow from now on. do you know what i mean, harry?
I am not sure.
very slow.  but we are not going to stop, are we?
no.
no, we are not.
goodbye, harry. it was very good to see you again.
yes. would you like me to walk a little way with you?
that would be okay.
just a little way.
