judy--we're ready for you now.
he hates me.
what?
he hates me.
what makes you think he hates you, judy?
i don't think.  i know.  he looks at me like i'm the ugliest thing in the world.  he doesn't like my friends--he--
he makes you feel pretty unhappy?
he calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
do you think your father means that?
yes!  i don't know!  i mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  we're altogether and we're going to celebrate easter and catch a double bill.  big deal.  so i put on my new dress and i came out and he--
that one?
yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  he grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till i thought i wouldn't have any lips left.  and all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing i told you he called me.  then i ran out of the house.
is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
i was just talking a walk.  i tried to call the kids but everybody was out and i couldn't find them.  i hate my life.  i just hate it.
you weren't looking for company, were you?
no.
did you stop to talk to anyone, judy?  do you enjoy that?
no.  i don't even know why i do it.
do you think you can get back at your dad that way?  i mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  did you ever think of that?
i'll never get close to anybody.
some kids stomped a man on twelfth street, judy.
you know where they picked me up! twelfth street!  i wasn't even near there!
would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  did you notify the parents?
hey!  that's enough static out of you.
want me to imitate a stupid cop?
cut it out now.  i'm warning you.
yes, ma'am.
your mother will be down in a few minutes, judy--
what?
your mother will be down in a few minutes.
my mother?
she's being called for.
you said you'd call my father.
goodbye, judy.  take it easy.
john crawford?
yes, sir.
come with me, john.
do you know why you shot those puppies, john?  is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
plato.
can you tell me why you killed the puppies, plato?
no, sir.  i just went next door to look at them like i always do. they were nursing on their mother and i did it.  i guess i'm just no good?
what do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
i don't know.  end up in the electric chair?
where did you get the gun?
in my mother's drawer.
she keep it to protect herself, sir. she scared without a man in the house.
where's your mother tonight, plato?
they not together, sir.  we don't see him in a long time now.
do you hear from him, son?
you know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
head-shrinker?
oh, mrs. crawford don't believe in them!
well maybe she better start.
i don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
you don't?
no.  i definitely don't.  i did the sa--
he's a minor, mr. stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
say, listen--
i guess i cut pretty loose in my day too.
really, frank?  when was that?
listen--can't you wait till we get home?
whoa!  whoa!  i know you're a little upset but--
sorry.
what about you, jim?  got anything to say for yourself?
can't you answer?  what's the matter with you anyhow?
he's just loaded, honey.
i was talking to jim.
let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  the kid has no friends yet and--
tell him why we moved here.
hold it, jim.
you can't protect me.
you mind if i try?  you have to slam the door in my face?  i try to get to him--what happens?  don't i give you everything you want?  a bicycle--you get a bicycle. a car--
you buy me many things.  thank you.
not just buy!  you hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  we give you love and affection, don't we?
was it because we went to that party?  you know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
a minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
what?
stop tearing me apart!  you say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
that's a fine way to behave!
excuse us a minute?
sure.  sure.
someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
grandma?
get lost.
hang loose, boy.  i'm warning you.
wash up and go home.
big tough character.  you don't kid me, pal.  how come you're not wearing your boots?
too bad you didn't connect.  you could have gone to juvenile hall. that's what you want, isn't it?
no.
sure it is.  you want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  why?
leave me alone.
no.
i don't know why--!
go on--don't give me that.  someone giving you hard looks?
i just get so--  boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. ray  okay.  okay.  let it out.
you feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
all the time!  i don't know what gets into me--but i keep looking for trouble and i always--i swear you better lock me up.  i'm going to smash somebody--i know it.
try the desk.
that why you moved from the last town? 'cause you were in trouble? you can talk about it if you want to--i know about it anyway. routine check.
and they think they are protecting my by moving.
you were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. why did you do it?
mess that kid up?
he called me chicken.
and your folks didn't understand?
they never do.
so then you moved?
they think i'll make friends if we move.  just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
but you don't think that's a solution.
things pretty tough for you at home?
she eats him alive and he takes it.
what a zoo!
what?
a zoo.  he always wants to be my pal, you know?  but how can i give him anything when he's--i mean i love him and i don't want to hurt him--but i don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
pretty mixed up?
if he could--
"if he could" what?  you mean your father?
i mean if he had the guts to knock mom cold once i bet she'd be happy and i bet she'd stop picking.  they make mush out of him.  just mush. one thing i know is i never want to be like him.
chicken?
i bet you see right through me, don't you?
how can anyone grow up in this circus?
you got me, jim--but they do.  want some water?
boy--if i had one day when i didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or i felt i belonged some place.
here.  look, will you do something for me?  if the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  it's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
okay--
any time--day or night.  you calmed down enough to go back now?
you serious?
i'm sorry.
all right, darling.
luck, jim.  don't forget.
have some cigars.
no thanks, i don't smoke.
go on--give 'em to your friends.
no--thanks, very much, mr. stark.
sit down and eat--you'll be late.
it'd stick in my throat, mom.  i'm nervous or something--
mother--
you make any sandwiches?
my first day of school, mother'd make me eat and by golly i could never even swallow till recess--
'bye, mom.
goodbye, dear.
so long, young fella.  knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
sure--  you know something?  i have a feeling we're going to stay here.
and listen--watch out about the pals you choose--know what i mean? don't let them choose you--
hi.  i saw you before.
bully for you.
you don't have to be unfriendly.
now that's true!
see?
"life is crushing in on me."
"life can be beautiful." hey, i know where it was.
where what was.
where i saw you.  everything going okay now?  you live around here?
who lives?
see, i'm new.
won't mother be proud.
you're really flipped--aren't you.
where's dawson high school?
you going there?
yeah--why--
dig the square wardrobe!
yeah.  so where's the high school?
university and 10th--want to carry my books?
the kids take me.
oh.
i'll bet you're a real yo yo.
a what?
goodbye!  see you!
i'm not so bad.
steady marlon!
wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
what's that?
a new disease.
friend of yours?
i'm glad they let you out.
nobody chickened.
i heard about it.  you're lucky he lived.
they always live.
hi.
hi there.
you remember me?
no.  i don't think so--
i'm sorry--i made a mistake.
boy!
what?
once you been up there, you know you been some place!
you shouldn't monkey with him.
what?
he's a wheel.  so's she.  it's hard to make friends with them.
i don't want to make friends.
what's your name!
jim.  what's yours?
plato.  it's a nickname.
listen, i told you not to fool with them.  now they're waiting for you.
i know.  that's why i came back.
you scared?
i just don't want trouble.
he has a knife.
i saw it.  gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  do you think it never stops?
no.  it's perpetual motion.
oh, i bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  go- go-go!
i'm here.
they're still there!
jim--do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
no.  in the morning.
you know something?
what?
you watch too much television.
hey, he's real abstract and different.
i'm cute, too.
meaning me?
what?
chicken?
i thought only punks fought with knives.
who's fighting?  this is the test, man.  it's a crazy game.
machismo?
somebody find him a knife.
you satisfied or you want more?
how 'bout you?  say the word and you're cold, jack--you're dead.
buzzie--we better get out of here.
what's eating you, judy?  you want him alive?
where can we meet?
know the millertown bluff?
are you really going to meet them?
who knows.  plato?
what?
what's a chickie-run?
you thought i was mom?
yeah!
it's just this get-up.  the girl's out and i was bringing mom's supper.
and you dropped it?
yeah!  shh!
that's funny!
i better clean this up before she sees it.
how did you know that?
we used to sing it in school.  don't look at me with such horror. they had schools in those days.
but the same song.  i think it's fantastic!
we were romantic then too--
are you and mom home tonight?
no.  why?
nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
with us old creeps?  come on, we have to eat.
daddy--
good evening.
hi.
didn't you forget something?
what?
you're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  i thought you stopped doing that long ago.
i didn't want to stop.
i was talking to dad.
i didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
i guess i just don't understand anything.
i'm tired, judy.  i'd like to change the subject.
why?
i'd like to, that's all.  girls your age don't do that.  you need an explanation?
girls don't love their father? since when?  since i got to be sixteen?
you awake?
yes.
listen--i took a steak out of the freezer.  i thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
i'm not hungry.
hey--i want to ask you something.
shoot, jimbo.
suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  would you do it?
is there some kind of trick answer?
what would you do, dad?
i wouldn't do anything hasty. let's get a little light on the subject.
blood.
how'd that happen!  what kind of trouble you in?
the kind we've been talking about. can you answer me now?
listen--nobody should make a snap decision--this isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
we don't have time.
we'll make time.  where's some paper.  we'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
what can you do when you have to be a man?
well, now--
just give me a direct answer!  you going to stop me from going, dad?
you know i never stop you from anything.  believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  in ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
ten years?  now, dad--i need an answer now!
i just want to show you how foolish you are.  when you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
how'd you get here?
i hitched.
boy, i bet you'd go to a hanging.
my personality's showing again. should i leave?
no.  it's okay.
just him.
stay there.
what you say your name was?
jim stark.
buzz gundersen.
hi.
glad to meet you.
sure.  it's fine.
okay.
is he your friend?
yes.  my best friend.
what's he like?
oh, i don't know.  you have to get to know him.  he doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  he's sincere.
well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  i want him to teach me how and i bet he won't get mad if i goof.  his name's jim.  it's really james but he likes jim more.  people he really likes--he lets call him "jamie."
want to finish my hamburger?  i only took a bite.
okay.
this is the edge, boy.  this is the end.
yeah.
i like you, you know?
buzz?  what are we doing this for?
we got to do something.  don't we?
feel okay?
give me some dirt.
what's happening?
good luck, buzz.
i got to go in.  you better get home too.  hey--what?
why don't you come home with me?  i mean nobody's home at my house--and i'm not tired, are you?  i don't have many--people i can talk to.
who has?
if you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
hey...you flipped--or something? you better take off...
o.k.  g'night.  i got to pick up my scooter.  see you tomorrow.
yeah.
what happened, darling.  we were so worried.  i was going to take a sleeping pill, but i wouldn't till i knew you were home.
i have to talk to someone, mom.  i have to talk to you both.  and dad this time you got to give me an answer.
go ahead.
i'm in terrible trouble.--you know that big high bluff near miller- town junction?
sure--there was a bad accident there.  they showed the pictures on t.v.
i was in it.
how!
it doesn't matter how.  i was driving a stolen car--
do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
mom--i'm not--
and you wanted him to make a list!
will you let him tell it!
she never wants to hear.  she doesn't care!
i guess when i nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much i don't care!
just relax, please relax!
i told you dad, it was a question of honor.  they called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  i had to go or i would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  so i got in one of these cars and a boy called buzz got in the other.  we had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  i got out okay but buzz didn't.  he was killed.
good lord!
i can't keep it to myself anymore--
well, just get it off your chest, son.
that's not what i mean.  i've never done anything right.  i've been going around with my head in a sling for years...i don't want to drag you into this but i can't help it.  i don't think i can prove anything by going around pretending i'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
you're absolutely right!
are you listening to me?  you're involved in this!  i want to go to the police and tell them i was mixed up in this thing tonight?
you what?
no!
did anyone see you there?  i mean did they get your license number or anything?
i don't think so--
well--
what about the other boys--do you think they'll go to the police?
what's that got to do with it?
why should you be the only one.
look jim.  far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
are you going to preach now?  are we going to have a sermon?
i'm just explaining what you mean! you can't be an idealist all your life!  nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
that's right!
except yourself!
will you wait a minute?
you don't want me to go.
no!  i don't want you to go to the police!  there were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
but i am involved!  we're all involved, mom!  a boy was killed! i don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
you know you did wrong.  that's the main thing, isn't it?
no!  it's nothing!  just nothing! you always told me to tell the truth.  you think you can just turn that off?
he's not saying that!  he's saying don't volunteer!
just tell a little white lie?
you'll learn as you get a little older, jim.
i don't want to learn that!
well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
no!  you're not tearing me loose any more.
do i have to spell it out?
you're not going to use me as an excuse again, mom.  every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  now i want to do one thing right and i'm not letting you run away.  dad?
son--this is all happening so fast--
you better give me something, dad. you better give me something  mom?
jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
what's he going to pull--
nothing, crunch.  they picked him up like the rest of--
you see any cops?
you see any cops?
no--
he's going to cheese, i tell you. nobody arrested him!
i think i should go home.
no.  we're going to bring him down.
crunch--my father's--you going to kill him?
you clean out of your head?  come on!
excuse me--but--you know where i can find--i mean i don't remember his last name--
look--can't you see i'm writing?
i think his first name's ray--i have to see him.  it's very important.
what's the charge?
assault with a deadly weapon.
listen--
he's not here.  he's not at juvenile hall.  i don't know where he is.  he's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  how old are you?
my parents know i'm out.  they know i'm here.
come back tomorrow.
i'll wait for him.
why don't you come back tomorrow, son?  ever been booked before?
they'll be looking for you.
they saw where i jumped!  i didn't chicken!  what do i have to do-- kill myself?
it doesn't matter to them.
you were looking for me, weren't you?
no--i was just--maybe--
i tried to call you before. judy i thought so.
you still pretty upset?
i'm numb.
you cold?
even if i'm near a fire, i'm cold. i guess just about everybody's cold.
i swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  judy, what am i going to do?  i can't go home again.
neither can i.
no?  why not?  you know something?  sometimes i figure i'll never live to see my next birthday.  isn't that dumb?
no.
every day i look in the mirror and say, "what?  you still here?" man!
like even today.  i woke up this morning, you know?  and the sun was shining and everything was nice. then the first thing that happens is i see you and i thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
i'm sorry i treated you mean today. you shouldn't believe what i say when i'm with the kids.  nobody acts sincere.
why'd you get mixed up with them? you don't have to prove anything.
if you knew me you wouldn't say that.
i don't think you trust anybody, do you?
why?
i'm getting that way, too.
have you ever gone with anyone who--
sure.  lots of times.
so have i.  but i've never been in love.  isn't that awful?
awful?  no.  it's just lonely. it's the loneliest time.
why did you do that?
i felt like it.
your lips are soft when you kiss.
where you going?
i don't know, but we can't stay here.
where can we go?  i can't go back into that zoo.
i'm never going back.
listen!  i know a place!  plato showed me before.  an old deserted mansion near the planetarium  would you go with me?
you can trust me, judy.
i feel as if i'm walking under water.
frank?  i'm frightened.
what's that pounding?
i don't know.  first i thought it was jim but--
he's home.  i heard the car.
are you going down there?
look--just relax, will you?
see?  it stopped.
i still think you should go down.
who's there?  anyone there?
open it.
is he there?
no, honey.  no, he's not here.
jim!
who's that!
it's me!
how'd you find me?  what's happening?
they're looking for you!--
yeah?
everybody!  crunch and goon and everybody!  i think they're going to kill you.
we know.
they think you told the police on them.  they--who's in there?
judy.
help me in!
hey where'd you go?
i'm here.  shut up.
come out come out wherever you are!
shut up.  are you nuts?
no.  i'm scared.
we're safe here.  i hope.  what do you think?
wow!  well now-there-then!
isn't it crazy?
wowee ow wow!  let's take it for the summer.
oh, jim!
no--come on.  should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
you decide, darling.  remember our budget.
don't give it a thought.  only three million dollars a month!
oh, we can manage that!  i'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
why don't we just rent it for the season?
you see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  i'm so embarrassed i could die!
well--we're newlyweds.
there's just one thing.  what about--
children?  well, we really don't encourage them.  they're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
yes.  and so terribly annoying when they cry.  i just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
of course.  drown them like puppies.
see, we're very modern.
shall i show you the nursery?  it's far away from the rest of the house. if you have children--oh i hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  in fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
talk to them!  heavens!
nobody talks to children!  they just tell them one thing and mean another.
it's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  you know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
what?
there's only one key.
we'll take it!
come on!
what time is it?
hang loose.  we got all night.
that maid saw us.  she could identify us too.
you still want to go home, moose?
no.
then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
let's see how long we can stay under.
man, you're schizoid!
i'm what?  what?
you can't talk underwater!
i bet you hear everything i say!
isn't he schizoid?
hey!  how 'bout that!
haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
not lately.
how do you know so much about this junk, plato?
i had to go to a head-shrinker.  i only went twice though.  my mother said it cost too much, so she went to hawaii instead.
i came here before.
when was that?
when i was here?  when i ran away. i used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
who?
mom and dad.  i used to be in my crib and i'd listen to them fight.
you remember that far back?  boy, i can't even remember yesterday.
plato, where's your father now?
he's dead.  he was a hero in the china sea. jim you told me he's a big wheel in new york!
i did?  well, he might as well be dead.  what's the difference?
it's all right.
ever been in a place like this before?
not exactly.  it's certainly huge.
how many rooms do you think there are?
i don't know.
should we explore?
want to read any books?  take your pick!  isn't this the craziest?
hi.
hi.
what?
your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  you're so funny.
why?
i don't know--you just are. leaving a light for plato.  that was nice.
maybe he's scared of the dark.
are you?
here we are-- out of cigarettes-- junior's in the nurs'ry-- see how late it gets--
you don't need to do that.
there's something i should tell you, judy.
i know already.  we don't have to pretend now.
what a relief!
is this what it's like to love somebody?
you disappointed?
funny jimmy.  you're so clean and you--this is silly.
what?
you smell like baby powder.
so do you.
i never felt so clean before.
it's not going to be lonely, judy. not for you and not for me.
i love somebody.  all the time i've been looking for someone to love me and now--i love somebody.  and it's so easy.  why is it easy now?
it is for me too.
i love you, jim.  i really mean it.
what you run out on me for!  what you leave me alone for?
plato!
i don't want you for my father!
your father!
you crazy nut!  you crazy, crazy nut!
get away from me!
plato!
just walk over here quietly now-- and there won't be any trouble.
no!
we have to go back!
no!  i got to find him.
after he tried to shoot you?
he didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him.  he needed us.
he needed you, maybe.  so do i.
you should have heard him talk about you tonight.  like you were the hero in the china seas.
sure.  he was trying to make us his family.
they're killing him!
we heard firing.  he get anybody? you alone?
we got a cookaboo inside.  he wounded some kid earlier.
how'd he get in?
smashed the front door.
any other entrance?
down in back.
frank!
stay here.  that was my son!
you sure?
i think i know my son.
plato?
i'm here.
boy, i'm blind as a bat!  you got a match?  i'm going to break my neck in here.  where are you?
i've got a gun.
i know.  light a match, will you?
that's swell.  how are you?
i'm fine.
you think the end of the world will come at nighttime, jim?
no.  at dawn.
why?
i just have a feeling.  where are you?
here.
well, stop hiding and stand up.  i can't talk to you if i don't see you.
i'm not going to hurt you. plato why did you run out on me?
we didn't run out.  we were coming right back.
you sure?
sure i'm sure.  judy's waiting. you ready to come out now?
no.
i promise nothing'll happen if you do.  you want my jacket?  it's warm.
can i keep it?
what do you think?
you want to give me your gun now, plato?
my gun?
in your pocket.  give it to me.
i need it.
you trust me, don't you?  just give it to me for a second.
you promised to give it back.
friends never break promises, do they?  okay.  here.  now listen.  there are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  you understand that?  they said i could come in and bring you out.
why?
they like you.  okay?
come on!
hi, plato!
hi.
who's that?
just a guard.
i shot at one of them.
but you didn't hurt anybody.
those aren't my friends.  make them go away.
ray!  will you tell these guys to move back?
plato!
keep away from me!  i don't believe you anymore!
he depended on me.
and you can depend on me, son. trust me.  whatever comes we'll face it together, i swear.
judy--we're ready for you now.
he hates me.
what?
he hates me.
what makes you think he hates you, judy?
i don't think.  i know.  he looks at me like i'm the ugliest thing in the world.  he doesn't like my friends--he--
he makes you feel pretty unhappy?
he calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
do you think your father means that?
yes!  i don't know!  i mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  we're altogether and we're going to celebrate easter and catch a double bill.  big deal.  so i put on my new dress and i came out and he--
that one?
yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  he grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till i thought i wouldn't have any lips left.  and all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing i told you he called me.  then i ran out of the house.
is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
i was just talking a walk.  i tried to call the kids but everybody was out and i couldn't find them.  i hate my life.  i just hate it.
you weren't looking for company, were you?
no.
did you stop to talk to anyone, judy?  do you enjoy that?
no.  i don't even know why i do it.
do you think you can get back at your dad that way?  i mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  did you ever think of that?
i'll never get close to anybody.
some kids stomped a man on twelfth street, judy.
you know where they picked me up! twelfth street!  i wasn't even near there!
would you like to go home if we can arrange it?  did you notify the parents?
hey!  that's enough static out of you.
want me to imitate a stupid cop?
cut it out now.  i'm warning you.
yes, ma'am.
your mother will be down in a few minutes, judy--
what?
your mother will be down in a few minutes.
my mother?
she's being called for.
you said you'd call my father.
goodbye, judy.  take it easy.
john crawford?
yes, sir.
come with me, john.
do you know why you shot those puppies, john?  is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?
plato.
can you tell me why you killed the puppies, plato?
no, sir.  i just went next door to look at them like i always do. they were nursing on their mother and i did it.  i guess i'm just no good?
what do you think's going to happen, you do things like that?
i don't know.  end up in the electric chair?
where did you get the gun?
in my mother's drawer.
she keep it to protect herself, sir. she scared without a man in the house.
where's your mother tonight, plato?
they not together, sir.  we don't see him in a long time now.
do you hear from him, son?
you know if the boy ever talked to a psychiatrist?
head-shrinker?
oh, mrs. crawford don't believe in them!
well maybe she better start.
i don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
you don't?
no.  i definitely don't.  i did the sa--
he's a minor, mr. stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
say, listen--
i guess i cut pretty loose in my day too.
really, frank?  when was that?
listen--can't you wait till we get home?
whoa!  whoa!  i know you're a little upset but--
sorry.
what about you, jim?  got anything to say for yourself?
can't you answer?  what's the matter with you anyhow?
he's just loaded, honey.
i was talking to jim.
let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand?  the kid has no friends yet and--
tell him why we moved here.
hold it, jim.
you can't protect me.
you mind if i try?  you have to slam the door in my face?  i try to get to him--what happens?  don't i give you everything you want?  a bicycle--you get a bicycle. a car--
you buy me many things.  thank you.
not just buy!  you hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  we give you love and affection, don't we?
was it because we went to that party?  you know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
a minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
what?
stop tearing me apart!  you say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
that's a fine way to behave!
excuse us a minute?
sure.  sure.
someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
grandma?
get lost.
hang loose, boy.  i'm warning you.
wash up and go home.
big tough character.  you don't kid me, pal.  how come you're not wearing your boots?
too bad you didn't connect.  you could have gone to juvenile hall. that's what you want, isn't it?
no.
sure it is.  you want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  why?
leave me alone.
no.
i don't know why--!
go on--don't give me that.  someone giving you hard looks?
i just get so--  boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. ray  okay.  okay.  let it out.
you feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
all the time!  i don't know what gets into me--but i keep looking for trouble and i always--i swear you better lock me up.  i'm going to smash somebody--i know it.
try the desk.
that why you moved from the last town? 'cause you were in trouble? you can talk about it if you want to--i know about it anyway. routine check.
and they think they are protecting my by moving.
you were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. why did you do it?
mess that kid up?
he called me chicken.
and your folks didn't understand?
they never do.
so then you moved?
they think i'll make friends if we move.  just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
but you don't think that's a solution.
things pretty tough for you at home?
she eats him alive and he takes it.
what a zoo!
what?
a zoo.  he always wants to be my pal, you know?  but how can i give him anything when he's--i mean i love him and i don't want to hurt him--but i don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
pretty mixed up?
if he could--
"if he could" what?  you mean your father?
i mean if he had the guts to knock mom cold once i bet she'd be happy and i bet she'd stop picking.  they make mush out of him.  just mush. one thing i know is i never want to be like him.
chicken?
i bet you see right through me, don't you?
how can anyone grow up in this circus?
you got me, jim--but they do.  want some water?
boy--if i had one day when i didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or i felt i belonged some place.
here.  look, will you do something for me?  if the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  it's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
okay--
any time--day or night.  you calmed down enough to go back now?
you serious?
i'm sorry.
all right, darling.
luck, jim.  don't forget.
have some cigars.
no thanks, i don't smoke.
go on--give 'em to your friends.
no--thanks, very much, mr. stark.
sit down and eat--you'll be late.
it'd stick in my throat, mom.  i'm nervous or something--
mother--
you make any sandwiches?
my first day of school, mother'd make me eat and by golly i could never even swallow till recess--
'bye, mom.
goodbye, dear.
so long, young fella.  knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
sure--  you know something?  i have a feeling we're going to stay here.
and listen--watch out about the pals you choose--know what i mean? don't let them choose you--
hi.  i saw you before.
bully for you.
you don't have to be unfriendly.
now that's true!
see?
"life is crushing in on me."
"life can be beautiful." hey, i know where it was.
where what was.
where i saw you.  everything going okay now?  you live around here?
who lives?
see, i'm new.
won't mother be proud.
you're really flipped--aren't you.
where's dawson high school?
you going there?
yeah--why--
dig the square wardrobe!
yeah.  so where's the high school?
university and 10th--want to carry my books?
the kids take me.
oh.
i'll bet you're a real yo yo.
a what?
goodbye!  see you!
i'm not so bad.
steady marlon!
wanna make the colored lights go around and around?
what's that?
a new disease.
friend of yours?
i'm glad they let you out.
nobody chickened.
i heard about it.  you're lucky he lived.
they always live.
hi.
hi there.
you remember me?
no.  i don't think so--
i'm sorry--i made a mistake.
boy!
what?
once you been up there, you know you been some place!
you shouldn't monkey with him.
what?
he's a wheel.  so's she.  it's hard to make friends with them.
i don't want to make friends.
what's your name!
jim.  what's yours?
plato.  it's a nickname.
listen, i told you not to fool with them.  now they're waiting for you.
i know.  that's why i came back.
you scared?
i just don't want trouble.
he has a knife.
i saw it.  gee, look at that thing swing, will you?  do you think it never stops?
no.  it's perpetual motion.
oh, i bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  go- go-go!
i'm here.
they're still there!
jim--do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
no.  in the morning.
you know something?
what?
you watch too much television.
hey, he's real abstract and different.
i'm cute, too.
meaning me?
what?
chicken?
i thought only punks fought with knives.
who's fighting?  this is the test, man.  it's a crazy game.
machismo?
somebody find him a knife.
you satisfied or you want more?
how 'bout you?  say the word and you're cold, jack--you're dead.
buzzie--we better get out of here.
what's eating you, judy?  you want him alive?
where can we meet?
know the millertown bluff?
are you really going to meet them?
who knows.  plato?
what?
what's a chickie-run?
you thought i was mom?
yeah!
it's just this get-up.  the girl's out and i was bringing mom's supper.
and you dropped it?
yeah!  shh!
that's funny!
i better clean this up before she sees it.
how did you know that?
we used to sing it in school.  don't look at me with such horror. they had schools in those days.
but the same song.  i think it's fantastic!
we were romantic then too--
are you and mom home tonight?
no.  why?
nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
with us old creeps?  come on, we have to eat.
daddy--
good evening.
hi.
didn't you forget something?
what?
you're too old for that kind of stuff, kiddo.  i thought you stopped doing that long ago.
i didn't want to stop.
i was talking to dad.
i didn't kiss her so it's a big thing.
i guess i just don't understand anything.
i'm tired, judy.  i'd like to change the subject.
why?
i'd like to, that's all.  girls your age don't do that.  you need an explanation?
girls don't love their father? since when?  since i got to be sixteen?
you awake?
yes.
listen--i took a steak out of the freezer.  i thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
i'm not hungry.
hey--i want to ask you something.
shoot, jimbo.
suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor.  would you do it?
is there some kind of trick answer?
what would you do, dad?
i wouldn't do anything hasty. let's get a little light on the subject.
blood.
how'd that happen!  what kind of trouble you in?
the kind we've been talking about. can you answer me now?
listen--nobody should make a snap decision--this isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
we don't have time.
we'll make time.  where's some paper.  we'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
what can you do when you have to be a man?
well, now--
just give me a direct answer!  you going to stop me from going, dad?
you know i never stop you from anything.  believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  in ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
ten years?  now, dad--i need an answer now!
i just want to show you how foolish you are.  when you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
how'd you get here?
i hitched.
boy, i bet you'd go to a hanging.
my personality's showing again. should i leave?
no.  it's okay.
just him.
stay there.
what you say your name was?
jim stark.
buzz gundersen.
hi.
glad to meet you.
sure.  it's fine.
okay.
is he your friend?
yes.  my best friend.
what's he like?
oh, i don't know.  you have to get to know him.  he doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it.  he's sincere.
well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  i want him to teach me how and i bet he won't get mad if i goof.  his name's jim.  it's really james but he likes jim more.  people he really likes--he lets call him "jamie."
want to finish my hamburger?  i only took a bite.
okay.
this is the edge, boy.  this is the end.
yeah.
i like you, you know?
buzz?  what are we doing this for?
we got to do something.  don't we?
feel okay?
give me some dirt.
what's happening?
good luck, buzz.
i got to go in.  you better get home too.  hey--what?
why don't you come home with me?  i mean nobody's home at my house--and i'm not tired, are you?  i don't have many--people i can talk to.
who has?
if you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to--  gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
hey...you flipped--or something? you better take off...
o.k.  g'night.  i got to pick up my scooter.  see you tomorrow.
yeah.
what happened, darling.  we were so worried.  i was going to take a sleeping pill, but i wouldn't till i knew you were home.
i have to talk to someone, mom.  i have to talk to you both.  and dad this time you got to give me an answer.
go ahead.
i'm in terrible trouble.--you know that big high bluff near miller- town junction?
sure--there was a bad accident there.  they showed the pictures on t.v.
i was in it.
how!
it doesn't matter how.  i was driving a stolen car--
do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
mom--i'm not--
and you wanted him to make a list!
will you let him tell it!
she never wants to hear.  she doesn't care!
i guess when i nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much i don't care!
just relax, please relax!
i told you dad, it was a question of honor.  they called me chicken-- you know, chicken!  i had to go or i would never have been able to face any of those kids again.  so i got in one of these cars and a boy called buzz got in the other.  we had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff.  i got out okay but buzz didn't.  he was killed.
good lord!
i can't keep it to myself anymore--
well, just get it off your chest, son.
that's not what i mean.  i've never done anything right.  i've been going around with my head in a sling for years...i don't want to drag you into this but i can't help it.  i don't think i can prove anything by going around pretending i'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
you're absolutely right!
are you listening to me?  you're involved in this!  i want to go to the police and tell them i was mixed up in this thing tonight?
you what?
no!
did anyone see you there?  i mean did they get your license number or anything?
i don't think so--
well--
what about the other boys--do you think they'll go to the police?
what's that got to do with it?
why should you be the only one.
look jim.  far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
are you going to preach now?  are we going to have a sermon?
i'm just explaining what you mean! you can't be an idealist all your life!  nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
that's right!
except yourself!
will you wait a minute?
you don't want me to go.
no!  i don't want you to go to the police!  there were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
but i am involved!  we're all involved, mom!  a boy was killed! i don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
you know you did wrong.  that's the main thing, isn't it?
no!  it's nothing!  just nothing! you always told me to tell the truth.  you think you can just turn that off?
he's not saying that!  he's saying don't volunteer!
just tell a little white lie?
you'll learn as you get a little older, jim.
i don't want to learn that!
well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
no!  you're not tearing me loose any more.
do i have to spell it out?
you're not going to use me as an excuse again, mom.  every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse.  now i want to do one thing right and i'm not letting you run away.  dad?
son--this is all happening so fast--
you better give me something, dad. you better give me something  mom?
jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
what's he going to pull--
nothing, crunch.  they picked him up like the rest of--
you see any cops?
you see any cops?
no--
he's going to cheese, i tell you. nobody arrested him!
i think i should go home.
no.  we're going to bring him down.
crunch--my father's--you going to kill him?
you clean out of your head?  come on!
excuse me--but--you know where i can find--i mean i don't remember his last name--
look--can't you see i'm writing?
i think his first name's ray--i have to see him.  it's very important.
what's the charge?
assault with a deadly weapon.
listen--
he's not here.  he's not at juvenile hall.  i don't know where he is.  he's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  how old are you?
my parents know i'm out.  they know i'm here.
come back tomorrow.
i'll wait for him.
why don't you come back tomorrow, son?  ever been booked before?
they'll be looking for you.
they saw where i jumped!  i didn't chicken!  what do i have to do-- kill myself?
it doesn't matter to them.
you were looking for me, weren't you?
no--i was just--maybe--
i tried to call you before. judy i thought so.
you still pretty upset?
i'm numb.
you cold?
even if i'm near a fire, i'm cold. i guess just about everybody's cold.
i swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  judy, what am i going to do?  i can't go home again.
neither can i.
no?  why not?  you know something?  sometimes i figure i'll never live to see my next birthday.  isn't that dumb?
no.
every day i look in the mirror and say, "what?  you still here?" man!
like even today.  i woke up this morning, you know?  and the sun was shining and everything was nice. then the first thing that happens is i see you and i thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
i'm sorry i treated you mean today. you shouldn't believe what i say when i'm with the kids.  nobody acts sincere.
why'd you get mixed up with them? you don't have to prove anything.
if you knew me you wouldn't say that.
i don't think you trust anybody, do you?
why?
i'm getting that way, too.
have you ever gone with anyone who--
sure.  lots of times.
so have i.  but i've never been in love.  isn't that awful?
awful?  no.  it's just lonely. it's the loneliest time.
why did you do that?
i felt like it.
your lips are soft when you kiss.
where you going?
i don't know, but we can't stay here.
where can we go?  i can't go back into that zoo.
i'm never going back.
listen!  i know a place!  plato showed me before.  an old deserted mansion near the planetarium  would you go with me?
you can trust me, judy.
i feel as if i'm walking under water.
frank?  i'm frightened.
what's that pounding?
i don't know.  first i thought it was jim but--
he's home.  i heard the car.
are you going down there?
look--just relax, will you?
see?  it stopped.
i still think you should go down.
who's there?  anyone there?
open it.
is he there?
no, honey.  no, he's not here.
jim!
who's that!
it's me!
how'd you find me?  what's happening?
they're looking for you!--
yeah?
everybody!  crunch and goon and everybody!  i think they're going to kill you.
we know.
they think you told the police on them.  they--who's in there?
judy.
help me in!
hey where'd you go?
i'm here.  shut up.
come out come out wherever you are!
shut up.  are you nuts?
no.  i'm scared.
we're safe here.  i hope.  what do you think?
wow!  well now-there-then!
isn't it crazy?
wowee ow wow!  let's take it for the summer.
oh, jim!
no--come on.  should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
you decide, darling.  remember our budget.
don't give it a thought.  only three million dollars a month!
oh, we can manage that!  i'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
why don't we just rent it for the season?
you see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  i'm so embarrassed i could die!
well--we're newlyweds.
there's just one thing.  what about--
children?  well, we really don't encourage them.  they're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
yes.  and so terribly annoying when they cry.  i just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
of course.  drown them like puppies.
see, we're very modern.
shall i show you the nursery?  it's far away from the rest of the house. if you have children--oh i hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice.  in fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
talk to them!  heavens!
nobody talks to children!  they just tell them one thing and mean another.
it's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too!  you know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
what?
there's only one key.
we'll take it!
come on!
what time is it?
hang loose.  we got all night.
that maid saw us.  she could identify us too.
you still want to go home, moose?
no.
then shut your mouth before your guts run out!
let's see how long we can stay under.
man, you're schizoid!
i'm what?  what?
you can't talk underwater!
i bet you hear everything i say!
isn't he schizoid?
hey!  how 'bout that!
haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
not lately.
how do you know so much about this junk, plato?
i had to go to a head-shrinker.  i only went twice though.  my mother said it cost too much, so she went to hawaii instead.
i came here before.
when was that?
when i was here?  when i ran away. i used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
who?
mom and dad.  i used to be in my crib and i'd listen to them fight.
you remember that far back?  boy, i can't even remember yesterday.
plato, where's your father now?
he's dead.  he was a hero in the china sea. jim you told me he's a big wheel in new york!
i did?  well, he might as well be dead.  what's the difference?
it's all right.
ever been in a place like this before?
not exactly.  it's certainly huge.
how many rooms do you think there are?
i don't know.
should we explore?
want to read any books?  take your pick!  isn't this the craziest?
hi.
hi.
what?
your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  you're so funny.
why?
i don't know--you just are. leaving a light for plato.  that was nice.
maybe he's scared of the dark.
are you?
here we are-- out of cigarettes-- junior's in the nurs'ry-- see how late it gets--
you don't need to do that.
there's something i should tell you, judy.
i know already.  we don't have to pretend now.
what a relief!
is this what it's like to love somebody?
you disappointed?
funny jimmy.  you're so clean and you--this is silly.
what?
you smell like baby powder.
so do you.
i never felt so clean before.
it's not going to be lonely, judy. not for you and not for me.
i love somebody.  all the time i've been looking for someone to love me and now--i love somebody.  and it's so easy.  why is it easy now?
it is for me too.
i love you, jim.  i really mean it.
what you run out on me for!  what you leave me alone for?
plato!
i don't want you for my father!
your father!
you crazy nut!  you crazy, crazy nut!
