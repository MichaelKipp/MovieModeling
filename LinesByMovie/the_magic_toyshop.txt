mummy was scared of him, i think. he went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
she got away.
he made that. in his off hours.
it is as though he would trapped a real cuckoo inside.
did not you know he made things?
do not fret. it is only his dream. dreams are not catching, not like measles.
i did not know about the puppets. it is a lot to take in, all at once.

is that all?
ah, you should see the swan! his masterpiece. now, walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell.
finn, there is a splinter in your left foot.  if you do not let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
go away.
what did i do wrong?
i will not do it because he wants me to do it, even if i want to do it.
do what?  oh, i see.

living with him put years on me.
who is there?
let me in.
can i come into bed with you for a little while, i feel terrible.
well ... yes. all right. but -
ah, come on now!
would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
finn -
I am cold.
you <i>are</i> cold. where have you been?
i finished it off.
you did what?
he will murder you when he finds out.
he will be looking for another apprentice.
i hope he does not pick on jonathon.

almighty jove in the shape of a swan.
stop it!
I have got a present for you...
finn ...
in my pocket.
reprieve.
i know for a fact he did not take jonathon. jonathon went off by himself.
somebody could not wait until dark.
h'm?
nothing ... you should not have given victoria that guinness.
it was only a mouthful!
do you think we should take her up to bed?
i thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
did you now.
surely she is older?
