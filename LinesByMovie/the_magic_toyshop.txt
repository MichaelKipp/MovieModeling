'have ploughed the stormy seas - '
storms?
they're going to fly everywhere. mean things. they should have taken us.
we're too young.
i'm not too young. juliet was my age.
juliet who?
in the play. she was married, by my age. and mummy. mummy wasn't much older than me when she got married. well, not <i>that</i> much older.
you'll need to know who we are, we're the brothers of his wife, which makes us in an unsanctified kind of way, your uncles. me name is finn, me brother is called francie -
but you're irish!
there's no law, as i know of, to prevent it.
you'll put your clothes here.
there's no mirror.

curled up on the landing like love locked out!
i did like the music.
i carried you up to your bed.
he can't abide a woman in trousers. he says a woman in trousers is a sin against nature.
a sin against <i>what?</i>
slip up and change into a skirt, else he'll create something terrible. don't you want to make a good impression on your first day?
is there anything else i should know about him?
speak when you're spoken to. he likes his women quiet.
i saw his teeth in the bathroom.
he can take out his smile and keep it on a shelf, but, his bite is worse than his bark, isn't that so, old fellow?
mummy was scared of him, i think. he went to her wedding but he was <i>furious</i>, you can see it in the photograph.
she got away.
he made that. in his off hours.
it's as though he'd trapped a real cuckoo inside.
didn't you know he made things?
don't fret. it's only his dream. dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
i didn't know about the puppets. it's a lot to take in, all at once.
i want to go home.
home is where the heart is.
i can't go home because there's no home left.
i'm melanie.
you're late for breakfast.
she's not accustomed to being ignored.
she'll have to learn.
what about school?
did you do this?
victoria -
what? did you let that child play with one of my toys? i don't like children playing with my toys.  have to fix you up with another hammer, won't we. give her a saucepan to play with, that'll do.
what was <i>that</i> in aid of?
get away from me...
you're well built; how old are you?
sixteen. well, nearly sixteen.
i wanted my leda to be a little girl. leda and the swan. see?
oh no you can't. get on with the painting.
it's all right, finn.
that's your beach. this is the story. leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  night comes on. she hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. she runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. curtain.
is that all?
ah, you should see the swan! his masterpiece. now, walk along the beach and stoop to pick up the shell.
finn, there's a splinter in your left foot.  if you don't let me take the splinter out, it will fester.
go away.
what did i do wrong?
i won't do it because he wants me to do it, even if i want to do it.
do what?  oh, i see.
you're only a young thing.
you're not so old yourself!
living with him put years on me.
who's there?
let me in.
can i come into bed with you for a little while, i feel terrible.
well ... yes. all right. but -
ah, come on now!
would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
finn -
i'm cold.
you <i>are</i> cold. where have you been?
i finished it off.
you did what?
he'll murder you when he finds out.
he'll be looking for another apprentice.
i hope he doesn't pick on jonathon.
can you move over a wee bit?
the swan was so ridiculous. all the same, it did scare me.
almighty jove in the shape of a swan.
stop it!
i've got a present for you...
finn ...
in my pocket.
reprieve.
i know for a fact he didn't take jonathon. jonathon went off by himself.
somebody couldn't wait until dark.
h'm?
nothing ... you shouldn't have given victoria that guinness.
it was only a mouthful!
do you think we should take her up to bed?
i thought she was fondest of you, because you were the youngest.
did you now.
surely she is older?
what difference does <i>that</i> make?
how long has -
all the time.
i already lost everything once.
so did i.
but then i had a brother and a sister left.
so had i.
everything is gone, now.
nothing is left but us.
