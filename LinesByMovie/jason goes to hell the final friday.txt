mr. duke, how can you claim that jason voorhees is not truly dead?
how many times has jason been reported killed before, mr. campbell?
eight times.
eight times.  they've burned him, dipped him in nuclear waste --
-- but this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
they coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  ya' can't kill jason by gettin' rid of his body.  he'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, mr. campbell.
well, let's hope not!
yeah, that'd be a big shame...
in the media, you've frequently been described as "salty" --
-- look, just shut up.  let's cut through the shit.  you asked me here because you want me to catch and kill jason voorhees for ya'.  i'll do it, but it won't be easy...and it won't be cheap.  one hundred grand, non- negotiable.
i understand.  however, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the idaho skin stretcher.
skin stretcher was human.
mr. duke tonight i'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide american casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
-- yeah, yeah, yeah.  you just have your hundred grand ready.  for that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
diana -- you heard from jessica lately?
yes.
everything going okay?
it's going.
legs giving you trouble?
not so bad, today.
steven buggin' you?
do you have to ask?
ed...
okay.  so how is jessica?  you talked to her lately?
yeah, she's good, considering. that kid just takes everything in stride.
i gotta get back to work.
okay, i'll call you later.
anything else?
yes.
i know who you are.
i need to talk to you.
i'm kind of busy right now...
i'm going to kill jason voorhees -- and i need you to help me.
jason voorhees is dead.
you know he's not...and he's coming for you.
you food'll be right out.
no, i --
twenty.
look --
thirty.  name your price.  everyone has a price, what's yours?
look, i don't want your money!
then maybe i should offer it to your daughter...
what do you want?
you know what i want.  you know why i need you.
you need to leave.
i know everything about you, diana.
that's it, we're done.
what's the problem here?
n...nothing.
maybe you should be moving on.
maybe you should mind your own business.
get up!
why don't you blow me, chief.  after your girlfriend gets through.
you're talking about my lady.
she's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the duke yet.
goddamnit!
careful, chief.  i don't think you know who i am.
i know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show "bounty hunter" making trouble. i want you outta town and i want you outta town now!
that's very colorful, chief.
take him to my car.  i'll be out in a minute.
...but there just may not be enough time.  if you still care about her, if you still want to try to make things better between you two...we should talk.
so let's talk.
no.  not here.  come by my house tonight at eleven.  don't be late.
jesus!
sorry, di.  i was just going to my car.  i didn't mean to frighten you...
it's...it's all right.
listen...don't you worry about ed. he'll come around.  he's too good a sheriff to let you give him the slip.
i'm just too old for going steady, josh.
so's he and he knows it.
everything'll work out.  trust me on that.
okay.
good night, beautiful.
'night, josh.
what do you mean you've never made a prank call?
never.
you mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
i mean really never.
i'm sorry to hear that.  a famous man once said -- there is no worse regret then a temptation resisted.
jesus, steven, that's...that's really lovely.
i mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
hell, when steven was a kid, he was like, having strippers delivered to church bingos and shit.
that's disgusting.
disgusting?  bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  they raised enough money to build a day care center.
it was a community service.
absolutely.  the church even sent me an autographed picture of god.  ward!
what are you doing?
showing vicki what she missed out on by being such a dull kid.  now, the first thing you need in making a prank call is, of course, a phone.  this one, for instance.
steven, c'mon, we're not thirteen...
next, you dial a number.
...and it's now ringing...ringing... and -- hello? anthony's pizzeria? yeah, this is officer randy parker over at the station.
oh, c'mon, would you stop, please?
is this anthony?...yeah, well, i just have one question for you, anthony -- did you fuck my dog?
oh my god, steven.
yeah, well somebody fucked her and if i find out it was you, i'm gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.
i'm now begging you.
listen, since i got you on the phone -- ask the guys there if they wanna chip in for a hooker.  i'll send her right over.  her name is vicki.
steven!
she's a waitress at joey b's but she needs some extra cash.  ward's the pimp.
i'm literally going to kill you!
ten dollars! hell, i can't do that to you -- you can have her for a pizza.
a pizza?!
randy, you dipshit!  take these off!
sorry, i'm working now.  you see, i have a job...
randy, c'mon!
have a good night.
wanna know how i did that?
yeah...
gotta go.  see you guys later.
hello...
june the 19th.
you have to...save...jessica... save jessica and save the...
the what?
save your...
steven...
i'm here.
i'm scared.  i'm very scared.
oh, my dear god...
he was dead.  he had to be dead...
how many times do you want to hear this?
until i hear the truth.
i've told you the truth.
the truth?  that josh, a man i've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if i've got the order right here -- tried to rape diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
i know what it sounds like.
you don't know shit!
i didn't kill her!
then why were you at her house?!  she didn't want anything to do with you.
she asked me to come over.  she said she had something to tell me.
about what?
about jessica.
that's a lie.  diana would never talk to you about jessica.  not after what you did to her.
look, i know i treated her bad --
-- bad?!
you call what you did bad?!  you knocked her up and then left her!
no -- she left me!  after her miscarriage, i --
-- miscarriage?!  who the fuck told you jessica had a miscarriage?!
she did!
my god...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
she did have a miscarriage, didn't she?  didn't she?!
oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch...
jessica, i'm so sorry.  i...i wanted to have this cleaned up before you got here.
that's all right.  i was just...
she's beautiful.
her name's stephanie.
she's yours?
why didn't you tell me?
i was going to, i was going to tell everyone.  i just...didn't expect to be back here so soon.  is steven around?
does he know about what happened?
yeah.  sit down a second.  there's something i need to tell you about steven...
well?
i'm sorry.  i have to bring you to a cell.
are you crazy?!
i know, i know, i'm sorry but the sheriff is just berserk right now. c'mon.
i'll be back later.  you just be cool, okay.
okay.
don't do anything stupid.
what am i gonna do -- i'm locked up in a friggin' cell?!
i'm gonna get your outta this.  just hang tight.  okay?
okay.
where the fuck is she, duke?!
that's what i'd like to know.
why did you want her body?
for a good reason.
tell me.
sorry.
tell me!
information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
lock this asshole up.
you think you can lock me up in this piss-ass prison?  hell, this place is motel fuckin' six to me.
