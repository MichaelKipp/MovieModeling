i'm serious, honey. don't get out of my sight, all right? i want you to stay right by me. will you do that for me?
nods solemnly. gene reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh.
we made it.
skate-boarders i don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when i see some pin-head on rollerblades, i get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
keep your eyes peeled.
what about them?
i'm looking for them.
where?
right there.
haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that?
on tv.
you never saw your mom and me kiss like that?
so, come on. you never saw us kiss like that?
no way.
how did you see us kiss?
look at 'em. he'd do anything for her.-
young love.
foreigners! fuck!
frogs. they copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in kuwait, where the fuck are they?
ready?
nods.
let' s do it.
now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. you never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. right?
right.
could i see some identification, sir?
what?
is this about those kids? look, i'm sorry about that. but they darn near...
you're from santa maria, mr. watson?
yes.
come with us, sir.
i'd like to know what...
you don't want to cause a ruckus, with the little girl and all.
come with me, honey.
hey! i'll take the girl. i'll take the girl!
don't worry. she's good with kids.
you stole that.
no, i didn't. i confiscated it. there's a difference.
daddy?
yes. it's ok, lynn. these are our friends.
hey, would you look at this crazy car? everybody has their own radio. what do you think of that?
everybody does?
yep. and you can listen to it without anybody else listening. let's try it out.
this is what they call the jack. hi, jack!
laughs.
it goes in that little hole.
pay attention, mr. watson. pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt.
you wouldn't...
yes, yes, i understand.
good.
this is for you. in it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. it is her itinerary. she is presently - are you listening, mr. watson?
yes, i'm listening.
she is presently at the bonaventure hotel. that's right near here.
you're out of your mind.
what's your point?
i will do no such thing.
yes, you will, mr. watson.
and what happens if i don't call you?
i kill her anyway.
god can't help her, mr. watson. only you can help her.
only you.
you're wasting time.
he's going to help the police. your daddy is going to be a hero.
my daddy is going to be a hero? like power rangers?
you talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead.  do it.
go ahead, sugar die.
lynn!
i can hear you good. can you hear me?
yes. yes, i can hear you.
that's enough.
'daddy has to go now.
he has to say "over and out". daddy, you have to say "over and out".
over and out.
look at your watch. look at it! at one-thirty your little girl is dead. say it with me. at one-thirty my little girl is dead. say it. say it!
at one thirty my little girl is dead.
unless you do what you're told. go do it!
where to, sir?
the bonaventure. the bonaventure hotel. do you know where that is?
amtrack?
what?
you just come in on amtrack?
uh, yes..
business or pleasure?
business.
where'd you come from?
san diego.
oh, san diego? i've thought about moving to san diego.  it's hard to make a living in this town. these short hops.  can't make a dime on 'em. to lax, pasadena, then i can make a buck. these little hops cost me money.
sorry.
's okay. what do you think?
huh?
better in san diego? more opportunity there? what?
i really don't know. i don't live there. i was just visiting...a grave.
aw, too bad.
somebody close?
what?
the grave. somebody close?
look...i've... i've got a problem. a big problem...
oh, yeah?
this says "invitation only".
of course you're invited. you're a big donor to the campaign. they love you.
this'11 get you in anywhere.  red elevator. thirty-fifth floor.
where did you get these? who are you?
i'm the guy who's going to kill your daughter if you don't get moving.
i need your help.
what can i do for you mr....watson?
its'...ah...about my daughter....
you were saying?  your daughter....?
i...
yes?
she ..ahh...wanted me to... be sure to get your autograph.
of course.  i wish everything were that easy.
is that something precious?
no, that's,..that's fine
are you 'fucking with me!?
the gun...
what about the gun?
it wasn't loaded. i didn't put the bullets in it.
you...
that's pretty good.
i've done much better ones than this.
you have, huh?
oh, yes. i'll show you. i have much more colors at home.
that's good.  that's good, sweetie pie.
what do you do, if i may be so bold?
i'm just an accountant.
don't denigrate yourself, my friend. where would the government be without accountants?  they wouldn't know how hard they can squeeze us before we pop, isn't that right?
i have to do something.
what's that? you have to speak up.  i'm a little deaf in this ear. between that and my wooden leg i'm a mess. compliments of the united states army artillery corps.
i said i have to do something.
i'll have you out of here in two shakes o'f a lamb's tail.
is within himself.
you got anything smaller?
keep it.
it's a twenty.
keep it.
can i get out to flower street from here?
sure. go down past the bar. take you right out there.
you get another chance in ten minutes.
then i have time for a drink.
what would you do in my place?
me?
you got this under control?
yeah.
it doesn't look like it.
it's under control.
it better be.
what...?
tell me why i miss him.
he's dead?
that's right. he's dead. tell me why.
how should i...?
tell me why he's dead.
you killed him.
that's right, i killed him. he fucked up one too many times so i put a bullet in his eye. then i put two more into him just to make sure. now that was somebody i loved.
my wife always said i had a problem trusting people.
well, you can trust eleanor samara grant.
you don't understand. i'm going to trust you. and you have to trust me.
yes, you're right, i don't understand.
look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me.
all right, let's just...let's get security in on this.
no! you can't! they're in on it.
i don't see how they could be in on it. they're the best. they're hand- picked.
i don't know.
you've got to trust me. i'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. she's only six. she's just a little girl. please, please, trust me.
it's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances.
the man following me has a walkie- talkie. if he sees i'm not here he'll call his partner. i do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter.
he'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. wait a minute.
are you sure?
i've heard this speech a lot. come on. we'll take care of him.  we will.
but...
trust me. you asked me for help. let me help. trust me.
okay...
i think you better put that away.
i think you're right.
who is this? are you sure we can trust him?
i'm sure. it's her husband. he's her campaign manager.
we have to hurry.
i know. brendan, listen to me. someone is trying to kill eleanor.
he brought a gun onto the pool deck.
what?
he got onto the pool deck with a gun. how did he get past her security carrying a
i see. where is this gun?
well, is it real? do we know anything about it?
it looks real. i don't know anything about guns.
could i see it?
somebody mind telling me... ) what the hell happened!?
help me get her off the rug.
i killed you.
you fucked up.
i'm not stupid.. i know how this is supposed, to work.
do you now, mr. watson?
i kill her - and you kill me.
keep your voice down.
even if you don't, her security men will.
how am i supposed to get away?
that's not my problem, mr. watson
come back.
how do i know you won't kill my daughter once i'm gone?
yeah.
do it!
again.
no, please...
you remember me?
i remember. the big tipper.
something is going to happen. when it's over you'll know what i was talking about.
oh, man...
please. something is going to happen...
what? the end of the world? man, don't give me your mad rap. i'm not a bartender. i don't want to hear it. i raise a family doing this bullshit. do me a favor. get your crazy white ass out of my chair.
please...
hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. you want change?  you got it, brother. what was that you gave me, a twenty?
one thirty. california ballroom.
that's right. that gives you...
...twenty-six minutes to get your shit together.
let me talk to her again.
no.
i want'to talk to her.
forget about it.
i talk to her or you can forget about it.
don't you threaten me.
what are you going to do about it, shoot me?
you know what i'm gonna do.
what? walk out there and twist her arm off?
come back.
yeah.
put her on.
what gives?
just put her on.
yes, sweetie, it's me.
i'm tired. i want to.go now.
i know you do, honey.
can we go now?
not just yet, baby. there's...there's something daddy has to do.
to be a hero?
no, honey, not to be a hero. but i want you to remember something for me, all right?
all right.
he's doing it for you. no matter what anybody tells you, no matter who they are, he's doing it for you, because he loves you.
will you promise me that?
i promise.
all right. kisses to you.
no...kisses to you.
no. kisses to you.
no, kisses to...
mister, what are you dragging me into?
i'm not dragging you into anything. i don't expect...
cover your mouth.
what?
this gorilla's watching you, is that right?
that's right.
then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. i don't want him twisting my arm off.
my daughter. they have her in a van across the street. they say they'll kill her if i don't do something for them.
in twenty-five minutes in the california ballroom.
there was a woman. she was trying to help me. i watched him murder her.
what are you supposed to do?
kill the governor.
i knew i should have packed up and gone home as soon as i got that twenty. what am i supposed to do about this situation?
one of them is in on it. he might even be in charge. her security is in on it. there's only one person i know for sure isn't in on it.
who?
the governor. if i could just talk to her...
oh, jesus ...
no way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
then why'd you drag me into it?
it's my kid. i've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
it's about time i did. i was one of those guys, workaholics. i worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  that's just what i thought i was supposed to do.
yeah, all right, listen...
so when she wanted a divorce...i was...i didn't know what i'd done wrong. i didn't see it. i didn't see it....
why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
i'm sorry. you understand i don't mind dying if i could save my daughter. i mean that.
yeah, now listen.  i can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. you go down get yourself something to drink. make sure godzilla there, follows you.
what are you going to do?
keep the change.
don't think i won't.
where is he? did you lose him?
shut up.
meet irene.
hi.
irene is going to help.
thank you.
you said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.
yeah.
you're going to go see her.
what!?
what am i supposed to say to her?
it'll come to you. see if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. save us all considerable embarrassment.
mrs. grant, governor...i won't hurt you.
my security people are right next door.
i appreciate that.
one loud scream will bring them in here instantly. you won't get very far. think it over.
if i were here to hurt you i would have done it already.
that's...a comfort to hear.
i have a problem.
ah.
only you can help me. i'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, mrs. grant.
i remember you...in the elevator.
that's right.
you were very nervous.
it was because i had this...in my pocket
how do you know that?
i saw her die. she was shot. with this gun.
you shot her?
no.
who did?
i don't know. the only thing i know about him is that he works for your husband.
what?
and your husband works for somebody else.
what the hell are you saying?
i knew you wouldn't believe me.
i said i'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. you're telling me my people are in a plot against me. you're telling me my husband wants me killed. what do you expect?
there's only one way to find out for sure. try to cancel the last speech.
i'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
it's the last chance they have for me to kill you. try to get out of it. they won't let you. they can't. try to change the schedule and you'll know i'm right. what have you got to lose? it comes down to who you trust, them or me? test them.
i love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
this? i've never even fired one.
indeed.
well?
i don't know.
what are you going to do now?
what are you going to do!?
this is about power and you haven't got any. there's nothing more you can do. i'm sorry. thanks for trying.
get moving.
you' oughta learn to relax. i told you i've got it under control.
it's time. it's time now.
where are we going?
not very far, honey-pie. not far at all.
lousy. and i have siesta hair. i'm thinking of canceling the speech.
it's an important speech.
during a campaign every speech is important. this is free media exposure. primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
what's he doing here?
who, him? just visiting.
don't remind me.
what happened here?
nothing. i broke a lamp.
truth is, besides the headache i've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. make my apologies.
come on, el, you're a trooper. i'll get you some pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to sacramento. this is no time to lay down on the job. i don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. look what happened to bush. tell you what, if you want to blow off the sacramento speech, fine. but do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
all right, i'll do it.
that's my girl.
but i want to make some changes. get krista in here right away won't you?
aw, gee. i sent her on an errand.
you sent my assistant on an errand.
i've been a bad boy.
i'm not a baby.
you're a big girl, huh?
i'm not a big girl but i'm not a baby.
close your eyes.
why?
i've got something for you.
a surprise?
you ask too many questions. you want the surprise or not?
just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. only cost you a dollar.
i don't want my windshield cleaned.
you just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
no, i know i don't want it cleaned. get out of here.
don't be like that. think of me as the moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.
for the last time, i don't want it cleaned. now get the hell out of here!
it's already done. i've already done it. you have to pay me now.
i don't have to pay you nothin'.
you're going to deny me a lousy dollar after i've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
fuckin' a.
i don't think so.
hey!
i think this is worth a dollar.
oh, we'll have to do better than that.
you worthless piece of shit! gimme that!
goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here!
gimme a dollar.
fuck you!
i...1 would like to...thank you, mister wat... gene.
i would also like to apologize.
for what?
for not believing you.
believe me, i don't blame you.  this is the governor, lynn. say hello.
can we go now?
of course. i'll get a car to drive you.
no, that's... that's ok. we don't need any help. we'll be just fine. won't we, lynn?
good luck.
same to you.
thanks for the shine.
thanks for the tip.
that one.
nah.  hates his wife.

my daughter. they have her in a van across the street. they say they'll kill her if i don't do something for them.
in twenty-five minutes in the california ballroom.
there was a woman. she was trying to help me. i watched him murder her.
what are you supposed to do?
kill the governor.
i knew i should have packed up and gone home as soon as i got that twenty. what am i supposed to do about this situation?
one of them is in on it. he might even be in charge. her security is in on it. there's only one person i know for sure isn't in on it.
who?
the governor. if i could just talk to her...
oh, jesus ...
no way, there's nothing you can do to help me.
then why'd you drag me into it?
it's my kid. i've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl.
it's about time i did. i was one of those guys, workaholics. i worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  that's just what i thought i was supposed to do.
yeah, all right, listen...
so when she wanted a divorce...i was...i didn't know what i'd done wrong. i didn't see it. i didn't see it....
why don't you tell me about the early years some other time?
i'm sorry. you understand i don't mind dying if i could save my daughter. i mean that.
yeah, now listen.  i can't mess with these shoes any more or it's gonna look funny. you go down get yourself something to drink. make sure godzilla there, follows you.
what are you going to do?
keep the change.
don't think i won't.
where is he? did you lose him?
shut up.
meet irene.
hi.
irene is going to help.
thank you.
you said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing.
yeah.
you're going to go see her.
what!?
what am i supposed to say to her?
it'll come to you. see if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. save us all considerable embarrassment.
mrs. grant, governor...i won't hurt you.
my security people are right next door.
i appreciate that.
one loud scream will bring them in here instantly. you won't get very far. think it over.
if i were here to hurt you i would have done it already.
that's...a comfort to hear.
i have a problem.
ah.
only you can help me. i'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, mrs. grant.
i remember you...in the elevator.
that's right.
you were very nervous.
it was because i had this...in my pocket
how do you know that?
i saw her die. she was shot. with this gun.
you shot her?
no.
who did?
i don't know. the only thing i know about him is that he works for your husband.
what?
and your husband works for somebody else.
what the hell are you saying?
i knew you wouldn't believe me.
i said i'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. you're telling me my people are in a plot against me. you're telling me my husband wants me killed. what do you expect?
there's only one way to find out for sure. try to cancel the last speech.
i'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
it's the last chance they have for me to kill you. try to get out of it. they won't let you. they can't. try to change the schedule and you'll know i'm right. what have you got to lose? it comes down to who you trust, them or me? test them.
i love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
this? i've never even fired one.
indeed.
well?
i don't know.
what are you going to do now?
what are you going to do!?
this is about power and you haven't got any. there's nothing more you can do. i'm sorry. thanks for trying.
get moving.
you' oughta learn to relax. i told you i've got it under control.
it's time. it's time now.
where are we going?
not very far, honey-pie. not far at all.
lousy. and i have siesta hair. i'm thinking of canceling the speech.
it's an important speech.
during a campaign every speech is important. this is free media exposure. primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
what's he doing here?
who, him? just visiting.
don't remind me.
what happened here?
nothing. i broke a lamp.
truth is, besides the headache i've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. make my apologies.
come on, el, you're a trooper. i'll get you some pepto, you'll make one of your patented tributes to the common person, then back to sacramento. this is no time to lay down on the job. i don't care what the polls say, you can't afford to relax. look what happened to bush. tell you what, if you want to blow off the sacramento speech, fine. but do this one and we'll get out of the smog.
all right, i'll do it.
that's my girl.
but i want to make some changes. get krista in here right away won't you?
aw, gee. i sent her on an errand.
you sent my assistant on an errand.
i've been a bad boy.
i'm not a baby.
you're a big girl, huh?
i'm not a big girl but i'm not a baby.
close your eyes.
why?
i've got something for you.
a surprise?
you ask too many questions. you want the surprise or not?
just giving you the gift of a clean windshield. only cost you a dollar.
i don't want my windshield cleaned.
you just think you don't want your windshield cleaned.
no, i know i don't want it cleaned. get out of here.
don't be like that. think of me as the moses of dirty windshields leading you through the desert of dead bugs.
for the last time, i don't want it cleaned. now get the hell out of here!
it's already done. i've already done it. you have to pay me now.
i don't have to pay you nothin'.
you're going to deny me a lousy dollar after i've sweated like a pig giving you the gift of a clean windsheild?
fuckin' a.
i don't think so.
hey!
i think this is worth a dollar.
oh, we'll have to do better than that.
you worthless piece of shit! gimme that!
goddamnit, you fuckin' bum, come here!
gimme a dollar.
fuck you!
i...1 would like to...thank you, mister wat... gene.
i would also like to apologize.
for what?
for not believing you.
believe me, i don't blame you.  this is the governor, lynn. say hello.
can we go now?
of course. i'll get a car to drive you.
no, that's... that's ok. we don't need any help. we'll be just fine. won't we, lynn?
good luck.
same to you.
thanks for the shine.
thanks for the tip.
