mulder -- it is me --
where are you, scully?
I am on the roof.
did you find something?
no. i haven't.
what is wrong, scully?
I have just climbed twelve floors. I am hot and thirsty and I am wondering, to be honest, what I am doing here.
you are looking for a bomb.
i know that. but the threat was called in for the federal building across the street.
i think they have that covered.
mulder... when a terrorist bomb threat is called in, the logical purpose of providing this information is to allow us to find the bomb. the rational object of terrorism is to promote terror. if you would study model behavioral pattern in virtually every case where a threat has turned up an explosive device. if we do not act in accordance with that data -- if you ignore it as we have done -- the chances are great that if here actually is a bomb we might not find it. lives could be lost --
mulder...?
what happened to playing a hunch?
jesus, mulder...
the element of surprise, scully. random acts of unpredictability. if we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
i know you are bored in this assignment, but unconventional thinking is only going to get you into trouble now.
how is that?
you have got to quit looking for what is not there. they have closed the x-files. there is procedure to be followed here. protocol.
what do you say we call in a bomb threat for houston. i think it is free beer night at the astrodome.
now what?
it is locked?
had you.
no you didn't.
oh yeah. had you big time.
i saw your face, mulder. there was a moment of panic.
panic? have you ever seen me panic, scully?
i just did. you are buying.
alright... what will it be: coke, pepsi? a saline iv?
something sweet.
scully...
scully, i found the bomb.
where are you, mulder?
I am in the vending room.
scully, get somebody to open this door.
nice try, mulder.
mulder? tell me this is a joke.
thirteen fifty nine, thirteen fifty eight, thirteen fifty seven...
...thirteen fifty six...
hang on. I am going to get you out of there.
scully?
mulder. move away from the door. we are coming through it.
something is not right...
-- mulder! get in the car!
sit down, they are still talking to agent scully.
about what?
-- they are asking her for a narrative. they want to know why she was in the wrong building.
she was with me.
you do not see what is going on here, do you?  there is four hundred million dollars in damage to the city of dallas. lives have been lost. no suspects have been named. so the story being shaped is this could have been prevented. that the fbi did not do its job.
and they want to blame us?
agent mulder -- we both know that if you and agent scully had not taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
but it is not the lives we saved. it is the lives we didn't.
-- if it looks bad, it is bad for the fbi --
-- if they want someone to blame, they can blame me. agent scully does not deserve this.
she is in there right now saying the same thing about you.
i breached protocol. i broke contact with the s.a.c. i ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
agent scully says it was she who ordered you out of the building. that you wanted to go back.
whatever you told them in there, you do not have to protect me.
all i told them was the truth.
they are trying to divide us on this, scully. we can not let them.
they have divided us, mulder. they are splitting us up.
what? what are you talking about?
i meet with the opr day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
why?
i think you must have an idea. they cited a history of problems relating back to 1993.
they were the ones that put us together.
because they wanted me to invalidate your work, your investigations into the paranormal. but i think this goes deeper than that.
this is not about you, scully. they are doing this to me.
they are not doing this, mulder.  i left behind a career in medicine because i thought i might make a difference at the fbi. when they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. i felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. but it has not turned out that way. and now, if i were to be transferred to omaha, or wichita or some field office where I am sure i could rise, it just does not hold the interest for me it once did. not after what I have seen and done.
you're... quitting?
there is really no reason left for me to stay anymore.  maybe you should ask yourself if your heart's still in it, too.
poopy day?
yup.
a woman?  work.
what do you do?
what do i do.  I am a key figure in an ongoing government charade. an annoyance to my superiors. a joke among my peers. "spooky," they call me. spooky mulder. whose sister was abducted by aliens when he was a kid. who now chases little green men with a badge and a gun, shouting to the heavens and anyone who will listen that the fix is in. that our government's hip to the truth and a part of the conspiracy. that the sky is falling and when it hits it is going to be the shitstorm of all time.
i think that about does it, spooky.
does what?
why do not you go home to the old lady --
sorry. do not have one.
how is that?
standing around holding your yank while bombs are exploding.
do i know you?
no. I have been watching your career for a good while. back when you were just a promising young agent -- before that.
you follow me out here for a reason?
yeah, i did.
my name's kurtzweil. dr. alvin kurtzweil.
i know the name. why?
old friend of your father's.
how did you find me?
heard you come here now and again. figured you would be needing a little drinky tonight.
you a reporter?
I am a doctor, but i think i mentioned that. ob-gyn.
who sent you?
i came on my own. after reading about the bombing in dallas.
well, if you have got something to tell me, you have got as long as it takes me to hail a cab...
and what is that?
s.a.c. darius michaud never tried or intended to defuse the bomb.
he just let it explode.
what is the question nobody's asking? why that building? why not the federal building?
the federal building was too well guarded.
no. they put the bomb in the building across the street because it did have federal offices. the federal emergency management agency had a provisional medical quarantine office there. which is where the bodies were found. but that is the thing...
those people were already dead.
before the bomb went off?
that is what I am saying.
michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
michaud was a patriot. the men he is loyal to know their way around dallas. they blew that building to hide something. maybe something even they could not predict.
you are saying they destroyed an entire building to hide the bodies of three firemen...?
and one little boy.
i think you are full of shit.
do you?
i wake you?
no.
why not? it is three am.
are you drunk, mulder?
i was until about an hour ago.
is that before or after you got the idea to come here?
what are you implying, scully?
i thought you may have gotten drunk and decided to come here to talk me out of quitting.
is that what you would like me to do?
go home, mulder. it is late.
get dressed, scully.
mulder -- what are you doing?
just get dressed. I will explain on the way.
you have got something to show me.
yes.
we brought the atmosphere back down to freezing in order to control the development, which is nothing like we have ever seen.
brought on by what?
heat, i think. the coincident invasion of a host, the fireman, and an environment that raised his basic body temperature above ninety eight point six.
this man's still alive.
technically and biologically, though he will never recover.
how can this be?
the developing organism is using his life energy, digesting bone and tissue. we have just slowed the process.
do you want me to destroy this one, too? before it gestates?
no. no...we need to try our vaccine on it.
and if it is unsuccessful?
incinerate it. like the others.
this man's family will want to see the body laid to rest.
tell them he was trying to save the young boy's life, and that he died heroically like the other firemen.
of what?
they seemed to buy our story about the hanta virus. you will make sure the families are taken care of financially, along with a sizeable donation to the community.  maybe a small roadside memorial.
we are going to the morgue.
that area is currently off limits to anyone other than authorized medical personnel.
on whose orders?
general mcaddie's.
general mcaddie is who requested our coming here. we were awakened at three am and told to get down here immediately.
i do not know anything about that.
well, call general mcaddie.
i do not have his number.
they can patch you in through the switchboard.
why do not you go on ahead head and I will confirm authorization.
thank you.
this is one of the firemen who died in dallas?
according to this tag.
and you are looking for?
it is like jelly.
there is some kind of cellular breakdown. it is completely edematous.
and there is been no autopsy performed. there is no y incision here; no internal exam.
you are telling me the cause of death on the report is false. that this man did not die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
i do not know what killed this man. I am not sure if anybody else could claim to either.
you knew this man did not die at the bomb site before we got here.
I would been told as much.
you are saying the bombing was a cover-up. of what?
i do not know. but i have a hunch what you are going to find here is not anything that can be categorized or easily referenced.
mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody is going to figure out soon enough we are not even supposed to be here.  I am in serious violation of medical ethics.
we are being blamed for these deaths. scully, i want to know what this man died of. do not you?
is this dr. kurtzweil's residence?
you got some kind of business with him?
I am looking for him.
looking for him for what?
feds are looking for him, too.  real nice business he is got, huh?
what is that?
selling naked pictures of little kids over his computer.
you looking for him for some other reason?
yeah, i had an appointment for a pelvic examination.
you want a call if we turn up kurtzweil?
no. do not bother.
see this bullshit...? somebody knows I am talking to you.
not according to the men in blue.
what is it? kiddie porn again? sexual battery of a patient? I have had my license taken away in three states.
they want to discredit you -- for what?
for what? because I am a dangerous man. because i know too much about the truth.
you mean that apocalyptic trash you write? i knew your name was familiar. i just did not know why.
you know my work?
dr. kurtzweil, I am not interested in bigoted ideas about race or genocide. i do not believe in the elders of zion, the knights templar, the bilderburg group or in a oneworld jew run government --
i do not either, but it sure sells books.
i was right about dallas. was not i, agent mulder?
how?
i picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the american government. the daily newspaper.
you said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the federal emergency management agency. why?
according to the newspaper, fema had been called out to manage an outbreak of the hanta virus. are you familiar with the hanta virus, agent mulder?
it was a deadly virus spread by field mice in the southwest u.s. several years ago.
and are you familiar with fema? what the federal emergency management agency's real power is? fema allows the white house to suspend constitutional government upon declaration of a national emergency. to create a non-elected government. think about that.  what is an agency with such broad sweeping power doing managing a small viral outbreak in suburban texas?
are you saying it was not such a small outbreak?
what was it?
when we were young men in the military, your father and i were recruited for a project. they told us it was biological warfare. a virus. there were rumors about its origins.
what killed those men?
what killed them i will not even write about. i tell you, they would do more than just harass me. they have the future to protect.
I will know soon enough.
what killed those men can not be identified in simple medical terms. my god, we can not even wrap our minds around something as obvious as hiv. we have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
a plague?
the plague to end all plagues, agent mulder. a silent weapon for a quiet war. the systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. they have been working on this for fifty years. while the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned armageddon.
negotiating with whom?
i think you know. the timetable has been set. it will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. when our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. the president will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the federal emergency management agency. fema, agent mulder. the secret government.
and they tell me I am paranoid.
something is gone wrong -- something unanticipated. go back to dallas and dig. or you are only going to find out like the rest of the country, agent mulder. when it is too late.
how can i reach you?
you can't.
why are you whispering?
i can not really talk right now.
what did you find?
evidence of a massive infection.
what kind of infection?
i do not know.
scully -- listen to me. I am going home, then I am booking a flight to dallas. I am getting you a ticket, too.
mulder --
i need you there with me. i need your expertise on this. the bomb we found was meant to destroy those bodies and whatever they were infected by.
I have got a hearing tomorrow --
-- I will have you back for it, scully. maybe with evidence that could blow that meeting away.
mulder -- i can not -- I am already way past the point of common sense here --
I am looking for anything out of the ordinary. maybe something from the fema offices where the bodies were found.
we were not expecting to find those remains, of course. they went right off to washington.
was there anything in those offices that did not go to d.c.?
some bone fragments came up in the sift this morning. we thought there would been another fatality, but we found out fema had recovered them from an archeological site out of town.
have you examined them?
no. just fossils, far as i know.
you said you were not coming?
i was not planning on it. particularly after spending a half hour in cold storage this morning. but i got a better look at the blood and tissue samples i took from the firemen.
what did you find?
something i could not show to anyone else. not without more information. and not without causing the kind of attention I would just as soon avoid right now.  the virus those men were infected with contains a protein coat I have never seen before. what it did to them it did extremely fast. and unlike the aids virus or any other aggressive strain, it survives very nicely outside the body.
how was it contracted?
that i do not know. but if it is through simple contact of blood to blood, and if it does not respond to conventional treatments, it could be a serious health threat.
you said you knew the location of the archeological site where these were found.
show you right on a map.
yes.
we have a situation. the members are assembling.
is it an emergency?
who called this meeting?
strughold. he is just gotten on a plane in tunis.
we began to worry. some of us have traveled so far, and you are the last to arrive.
I am sorry. my grandson fell and broke his leg.
more concerns than that?
we have been forced to reassess our role in colonization by new facts of biology which have presented themselves.
its effect on the host has changed. the virus no longer just invades the brain as a controlling organism. it is developed a way to modify the host body.
into what?
my god...
the geometry of mass infection presents certain conceptual re-evaluations for us. about our place in their colonization.
this is not colonization, it is spontaneous repopulation. all our work... if it is true, then they have been using us all along. we have been laboring under a lie!
we are going to tell them what we have found. what we have learned. turn over a body infected with the gestating organism.
in hope of what? learning that it is true?! that we are nothing more than digestives for the creation of a new race of alien lifeforms?!
let me remind you who is the new race. and who is the old.  what could be gained by withholding anything from them; by pretending to ignorance? our knowledge may forestall their plans to step up the timetable. to start colonization early.
and if it doesn't? by cooperating now we are but beggars to our demise! our ignorance was in cooperating with the colonists at all.
cooperation is our only chance of saving ourselves.
our vaccine may have no effect!
well, without a cure for the virus, we are nothing more than digestives anyway.
my lateness may have well been absence. a course has already been taken.
there are complications.
do they know?
mulder was in dallas when we were trying to dispose of evidence. he is gone back there again. someone has tipped him.
who?
kurtzweil, we think.
we have allowed this man his freedom. his books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. has he outlived his usefulness to us?
no one believes kurtzweil or his books. he is a toiler. a crank.
and mulder?
you can not kill mulder. he is got too much light on him.
you need not kill a man to destroy him.
no, you need only take away what is most precious to him.
he did not mention a park.
this is where he marked on the map, scully. where he says those fossils were unearthed.
i do not see any evidence of an archeological or any other kind of digsite. not even a sewer or a storm drain.
you are sure the fossils you looked at showed the same signs of deterioration you saw in the fireman's body in the morgue?
the bone was porous, as if the virus of the causative microbe were digesting it.
and you have never seen anything like that?
no.  it did not show up on any of the immunohistochemical tests --
this looks like new grass to you?
it looks pretty green for this climate.
ground's dry about an inch down. somebody just laid this down. very recently, I would say.
all the equipment is brand new.
no irrigation system. somebody is covering their tracks.
do you live around here?
yeah.
not supposed to talk about it.
you are not supposed to talk about it? who told you that?
i think you better tell us.
we do not even know you.
well, we are fbi agents.
you are not fbi agents.
unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
i do not know, mulder.
and where are they going with it?
that is the first question to answer, if we are going to find them.
what are my choices?
about a hundred miles of nothing in each direction.
where would they be going?
we have got two choices. one of them is wrong.
you think they went left?
i do not know why i think they went right.
hey, i was right about the bomb, was not i?
this is great. this is fitting.
what?
I have got to be in washington d.c. in eleven hours for a hearing -- the outcome of which might possibly affect one of the biggest decisions of my life. and here i am standing out in the middle of nowhere texas, chasing phantom tanker trucks.
we are not chasing trucks, we are chasing evidence --
-- of what exactly?!
that bomb in dallas was allowed to go off, to hide something: bodies infected with a virus you detected yourself.
they haul gas in tanker trucks, they haul oil in tanker trucks -- they do not haul viruses in tanker trucks.
yeah, well they may this one.
what do you mean by haul?  what are you not telling me here?
this virus -- it...
mulder --
it may be extraterrestrial.
i do not believe this. i do not fucking believe this.  y'know, I have been here... I have been here one too many times with you, mulder.
been where?
pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where i am right now: at another dead end --
what do you think it is?
i have no idea.
this is weird, mulder.
very weird.
any thoughts on why anybody'd be growing corn in the middle of the desert?
not unless those are giant jiffy pop containers out there.
cool in here. temperature's being regulated.
for the purpose of what?
you hear that?
i hear the humming. like electricity. high voltage maybe.
maybe. maybe not.
scully....?
yeah...?
run.
what are you doing?
come on!
where did they go?
i do not know.
special agent scully --
i apologize for making you wait -- I have brought some new evidence with me --
evidence of what?
you have been back to dallas?
yes.
are you going to let us in on what exactly you are trying to prove --
that the bombing in dallas may have been to destroy the bodies of those firemen, so their deaths and the reason for them would not have to be explained --
-- those are very serious allegations, agent scully --
yes. i know.
and you have conclusive evidence of this? something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
nothing completely conclusive --
i hope to. we are working to develop this evidence --
working with?
agent mulder.
you found something?
yes. on the texas border. some kind of experiment. something they excavated was brought there in tanker trucks.
what?
I am not sure. a virus --
-- you saw this experiment?
what did it look like?
what do you think?
a transportation system. transgenic crops. the pollen genetically altered to carry a virus.
that would be my guess.
your guess?
you told me you had answers.
yeah, well i do not have them all.
you have been using me --
I have been using you?!
you did not know my father --
i told you -- he and i were old friends --
you are a liar. you lied to me to gather information for you. for your goddamn books. did not you?
you would be shit out of luck if not for me. you saw what you saw because i led you to it. I am putting my ass on the line for you.
your ass? i just got chased across texas by two black helicopters.
and why do you think it is you are standing here talking to me? these people do not make mistakes, agent mulder.
what? what is wrong?
salt lake city, utah. transfer effective immediately.
i already gave skinner my letter of resignation.
you can not quit, scully.
i can, mulder. i debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because i knew --
we are close to something here -- we are on the verge --
you are on the verge, mulder -- please do not do this to me --
after what you saw last night -- after all you have seen -- you can not just walk away --
i have. i did. it is done.
just like that --
I am contacting the state board monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
i need you on this, scully --
you do not mulder -- you have never needed me. I have only held you back.  I have got to go.
why was i assigned to you? to debunk your work. to reign you in. to shut you down.
you saved me, scully.  as different and frustrating as it is been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. i owe you so much, scully, and you owe me nothing.  i do not want to do this without you. i do not know if i can. if i quit now, they win.
what? what happened?
i think... something stung me.
scully...
something is wrong...  I am having -- lancinating pain -- my chest. my... motor functions are being affected. i'm...
...my pulse feels thready and I have got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
i think you are in anaphylactic shock --
no -- it is --
scully --
I have got no allergy. something... this... mulder... i think... i think you should call an ambulance.
what am i doing here?
you were shot in the head. the bullet broke the flesh on your right brow and glanced off your temporal plate.
penetration but not perforation.
they gave you a craniotomy to relieve the pressure from a subdural hematoma. but you have been unconscious since they brought you in.
when was that?
scully had a violent reaction to a bee sting --
you called 911. except the call was intercepted.
they took her --
agent mulder --
where is scully?!
she is missing. we have been unable to locate her or the vehicle they took her in.
whoever they are -- this goes right back to dallas -- it goes right back to the bombing --
i know.  agent scully reported your suspicions to opr. on the basis of her report, i sent techs over to s.a.c. michaud's apartment. they picked up pstn residues on his personal effects consistent with the construction of the vending machine device in dallas.
how deep does this go?
i do not know.
are we being watched?
I am not taking any chances.
i need your clothes, byers.
me?
what are you doing?
I have got to find scully.
mr. mulder.
what happened to kurtzweil?
he is come and gone.
where is scully?
i have answers for you.
is she alive?
yes.
I am quite prepared to tell you everything, though there is not much you have not guessed.
about the conspiracy?
i think of it as an agreement. a word your father liked to use.
i want to know where scully is.
what is it?
a weak vaccine against the virus agent scully has been infected with. it must be administered with ninety six hours.
you are lying.
no. though i have no way to prove otherwise. the virus is extraterrestrial. we know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
a virus?
a simple, unstoppable lifeform. what is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. and attacks.
this is what you have been conspiring to conceal? a disease?
no! for god sake you have got it all backwards.
aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. this virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.
what do you mean, walked?
your aliens, agent mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. those that did not leave have been laying dormant underground since the last ice age. in the form of an evolved pathogen. waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. using us as hosts. against this we have no defense. nothing but a weak vaccine.  do you see why it was kept secret? why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known?
until dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. that mass infection would make us a slave race.
that is why you bombed the building. the infected firemen, the boy --
imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. my group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs. to give us access to the virus. in false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. so that we might save ourselves, as the last of the species.  your father wisely refused to believe this, choosing hope over selfishness. hope is the only future he had: his children,  the only future any of us have.
but... he sacrificed his own daughter. my sister, samantha.
the only true survivors of the viral holocaust will be those immune to it: those vaccinated against it and human/alien hybrids. your father arranged for your sister's abduction. he allowed her to be taken to an alien hybrid program, so that she would survive. as a clone.  he had different hopes for you. that you would uncover the truth about the project. that you would stop it. that you would fight the future.
why are you telling me this?
i thought it only fair you should know, given how hard you have worked.
what happened to kurtzweil?
as your father knew, things need to be sacrificed to the future.
where is he?
dr. kurtzweil is in the trunk.
let me out. stop the car.
driver.
you have precious little time. what I have given you the alien colonists have no idea exists. you hold in your hand the power to end the project.
how?
the vaccine you hold is the only defense against the virus. its introduction into an alien environment may have the power to destroy the delicate plans we have so assiduously protected for the last fifty years.  or it may not.
what alien environment?
find agent scully. save her. only her science can save the future.
what about you?
my life is over.  go.
cold...
hang on. I am going to get you out of here.
we have got to keep moving.
where are we?
you got me. but i think i know what they did with jimmy hoffa.
i can not go any farther.
yes you can. you are going to make it, scully.
what is it you find incredible?
well...where would you like me to start? antarctica is a long way from dallas, agent scully. i can not very well submit a report to the attorney general that alleges the links you have made here. bees and corn crops do not quite fall under the rubric of domestic terrorism.
no, they don't.
most of what i find in here is lacking a coherent picture of an organization with an attributable motive. i realize you are very lucky to be alive agent scully. the ordeal you have endured has clearly affected you -- though the holes in your account leave this panel with little choice but to delete these references from our final report to the justice department. until which time hard evidence becomes available that would give us cause to pursue such an investigation.
