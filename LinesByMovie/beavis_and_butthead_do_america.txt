talk ta me, bork.
chief, we found a witness that says he saw two teenagers leaving dallas' room shortly before we arrived.
did you give him a full cavity search?
ah, the witness?
yes. you can never be too careful bork.
well sir, i did not really think it was necessary. you see we have a picture of them from the elevator security cam. here, have a look.
they look like a couple of kids chief.
bork, do not you realize what kids today are capable of? do not you read the papers?
beavis, huh huh, what'er you doing?
my butt's bothering me!
you should kick your butt's ass. huh huh huh.
dammit, all they have is shows about water.
that sucks. heh heh. they need some shows about fire! change the channel.
uh...
that was boring. huh huh.
yeah, it is just the same thing over and over again.
uh... we can not leave washington 'till we find that chick.
you see what i see, bork?
i see it. i do not get it.
you got half the state looking for ya - how do you get away?
cut the power!
damn right. bork, we are dealing with real pros here. my opinion, terrorists... what is the scoop on that stolen unit?
well, sir it is not good.  roll the tape... the x-5 unit is a new top-secret biological weapon, a manmade virus...
jesus jumped-up christ! if this were to fall into the wrong hands...
it gets worse. the unit was not finished. it has a flaw - the casing. if hit hard enough, it could break open, releasing the virus.
ow! cut it out butt-head.
huh huh. get out of the way, beavis, i wanna sit by the window. huh huh.
ow! I will kick your butt!
huh huh. you mean like this?
that is not that much.
yeah really. let's get outta here beavis. huh huh huh. this sucks.
uh... is this the right bus?
you mean there is mre than one?
huh huh huh. hey beavis. we are on a bus with chicks.
heh hmm heh heh.
check it out butt-head, porta-potties.
cool, huh huh.
hey, where did those chicks go?
uh... i think you scared them off.
this sucks. what are we doing here? were not we suppost'a go to washington and score or something?
cavity search...?
deep and hard.
this sucks. it is all hot and stuff.
this desert is stupid. they need to put a drinking fountain out here.
yeah or like a seven-eleven or something... are we almost there?
uh, probably like, another five minutes or something.
uh...
dammit!!!! dammit!!!!
uh, hey. one of you kids got a match?
uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
chief, you know that guy whose camper they were whacking off in?
bork! you are a federal agent. you represent the united states government... never end a sentence with a preposition. try again.
oh, ah... you know that guy in whose camper they... i mean that guy off in whose camper they were whacking?
that is better. yes?
we have run a sample through the national criminal sperm bank and come up with two possible genetic matches for a father.
you were a roadie for motley crue?

well, then you know what I am talking about. anyway, here's the story. i scored with these two chicks. true story.

yeah, they were sluts. huh huh huh.
shut up, dumb-ass! you did not score. i scored with both of them...
uh, do you think these two sluts still live in highland? that would be cool.
hey, you wanna see something really cool? huh huh huh.
hey butt-head, is not there supposed to be like, water in cactuses?

where did these guys come from?
what the hell...? bork! that bus we picked up. where was it headin'?
d.c., chief.
jesus jumped-up... bork, can you imagine what would happen if they set that thing off in our nation's capital, or even worse, if they sold it to some damned foreigner at that conference.  well, it is not going to happen!

ok, nobody shoot. he could still have the unit on him. keep your distance. we do not wanna take a chance on hitting it.
