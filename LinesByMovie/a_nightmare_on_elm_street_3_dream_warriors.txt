are you crazy?  you will wake the whole neighborhood!
hi mom.
do not "hi mom" me.  what are you still doing up?  it is past one!
i thought I would wait for you.
well, I am home now, so you can go right to sleep.  c'mon, angel.
it is okay, I am not tired.  really.
kristen, do not start with me.  you know what your shrink said...
he is full of shit.
i am not going to let you get me into an argument, goddamn it.  not tonight.  now get in bed.
and you do not want to keep him waiting.
that is right.  i don't.
nothing like a little cheery news to start the day.
say listen, doc.  i got a new theory about all these suicides.
do not hold back on us, max.  we need all the help we can get.
fucked up chromosomes, man.  think about it.  their parents all dropped acid in the sixties.
it beats dr. simm's theory.  she thinks it is nothing but sex, drugs, and rock & roll.
shit, that is what keeps people alive.
good morning, jennifer.
morning, doctor goldman.
how is your hand?
menthol, regular, ultra-light.
they are healing up nicely.
I have been good.  when do i get cigarette priveleges back?
do not hold your breath.
how is he?
cooling down.
if he continues having these outbursts, I will have to have him isolated permanently.
do not worry, it will not come to that.
what did you think?
frankly, i do not understand why some grad school superstar is being treated like a seasoned pro.
she is been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
elizabeth, we do not need any outside help.  i know these kids.  i do not want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
tell me about the kids.
you will get to meet them all tomorrow. they're...survivors.  in a way.  all severely sleep disordered.  insomnia, narcolepsy, bedwetting...
but nightmares are the common thread?
right.  they seem to share a group delusion,  a "boogeyman" for lack of a better word.  they are so traumatized, they will do anything not to sleep.
anything?
we lost a kid about a month ago to fairview.  i do not know where he got the razor...but he cut off his own eyelids to stay awake.
oh god.
ever work with vets?  these kids act like they have got d.s.s. -- delayed stress syndrome. if i did not know better, I would swear they would seen heavy combat.
i would not be so sure they haven't.
what is that supposed to mean?
I have had some experience with pattern nightmares.
so I have been told.  practically an obsession of your.
call it a passion.  I have got to get going.
make sure to check in with max, he will give you the 25 cent tour.
ms. thompson.
call me nancy.
only if you call me neil.  what was that nursery rhyme all about?
just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
the whole wing's devoted ot this program.  that is your office.
a little basic, but nice.
I will have a file cabinet in there before tomorrow.  the patient's rooms are down here.
this is phillip.  we call him the walker.
why is that?
mrs. parker, was kristen acting different? did you notice anything strange before she made the attempt?
kristen specializes in strangeness.  I have spent thousands on psychiatirists.
did she always have nightmares?
they have gotten worse since i took away her credit cards.
I am serious.
look, miss thompson, i do not know what you want from me.
just some answers.  there are other kids involved, its not just kristen.  all good kids, smark kids.
I am sorry to hear that, but you are the experts on this, not me.  if i had any insights, believe me, I would share them with you.
I am sure you would.
now if you will excuse me, i have to get to the club.
I will need to take her things.
the maid packed a suitcase.  teresa!  teresa?
I will get it.  please, i do not mind.
first door up the stairs.
you pulled me in somehow, did not you?
i -- i think so!
you are late.
did not get much sleep.
well, we have got --
max, where is kristen?
she is been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
i used to live in this house.
but...it's just a house I have dreamed about.  i dream about it all the time.  thank you for what you did last night.
have you ever done that before?  pulled someone into your dream?
when i was a little girl.  three or four. if i had a nightmare, I would bring my dad in. the dream would always get better.  he always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. nancy when did it stop?
when i was still a kid.  my folks got divorced.  after a while, i thought I would imagined the whole thing.  i guess i didn't.
it is an amazing gift.
that man in my dreams.  he is real is not he?
he is real.
okay, group's in session.  straight talk only in this room.
today I would like to start by getting us acquainted with our new staff member, nancy thompson.  let's make her feel welcome.
I am will stanton, and um...i've had a little accident, as you can see.
accident my ass.  i thought this was supposed to be straight talk in here.
I am taryn white.  i only came here because it was a better deal than juvie hall.  also, i guess 'cause I am going through some very stange shit.
your dreams?
hey, everybody has bad dreams.
and you will not make any progress until you can recognize your dreams for what they are.
and what are they?
the by-product of guilt.  psychological scars steaming from moral conflicts and overt sexuality.
yes, tell us, nancy.
all i can say is this is not something that is just going to disappear.  you are all going to have to face it.  fight it. and if you are willing to work together... wiling to stand up to your deepest fears...i think we can beat it.
okay, you are attacked by the bog demon. go ahead.
uh, fourteen.
does not count.  you got to say the words.
this is stupid.
c'mon.
in the name of elric, prince of elves, demon begone.
good.  you conquer the demon, but your horse is sinking in the bog.  what do you do?
i go to bed and get a new horse in the morning.
this is nice.
never been here before?
must have opened while i was away at school.
most authentic mexican food in springwood, which is not saying much.  your parents still live around here?
my mother's dead.  died in her sleep.
sorry.
my father an i...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
sounds like a rough time.
it was.  neil, do you believe in other realities?
I have been to pittsburgh.  does that count?
I am serious.
okay...i believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you are into ufo's or atlantis, you have lost me.
what if i told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
that is a new one.  is that what they are teaching now at stanford?
that is what i know.
the nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
all right.  then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
with hypnocyl?
that is right.
you want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
just until we get things under control.
dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with.  you have no business taking it yourself.
i used to be like them, neil.  i know what they are going through.
so do i.
do you?  you told me they are survivors...and they are.  but how much longer they survive is up to us.
I am sorry, nancy.  the answer is no.
horseshit.
no, she is right.
that is enough, kincaid.
there will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  from now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  we will begin a policy of evening sedation.  for everybody.
we will begin sedation tonight.  starting with him.
you can't!  they will be defenseless against their dreams.
that is precisely what they need.  some uninterrupted rem sleep to release all this negative energy.
neil, please --
elizabeth, I am prescribing hypnocyl.  it is a dream suppressant.
i know what it is.  i just can not believe what I am hearing.  what has she talked you into?
nothing.  they are my patients.  it is my decision.  i want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
i will not allow it.
I will go straight to carver if i have to.  he will either back me up or accept my resignation.
i can not believe i just did that.
do you think we can get the hypnocyl in by tomorrow?
we are going to try.
puttin' in soem late hours, i see.  if you are trying for o.t., you are in the wrong place.
i just wanted to be here for the kids. how are they?
restless.  very restless.
nancy?  would you sit with me awhile?
sure.
you need me, I will be here all night.
thanks, max.
hi, sweet stuff.  good news.
can not be good news coming from you.
pulled night duty.  trimble's sick.
so?
so...got the keys to heaven, baby.
what?
the dispensary.  I am talking clean pharmaceutical high.  a night at club meth.
i do not do that shit.
what are these, beauty marks?
those are ancient history.
oh yeah?  well, if you are ever in the mood for a history lesson, I am your teacher, understand?
stay out of my face or I will go straight to max.
now who is going to take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
fuck off.
girl, what are you doing?
watching tv.
i can see that. you watch too damn much tv.
research.
oh, right.  you are going to be a tv star.
wait and see.
if simms catches you in here after lights out, she will chew my ass ragged.
i gotta stay up, max.
jennifer --
just tonight, please?  i can not handle the nightmare.  not tonight.  not after phillip.
if you get caught, i never saw you. deal?
deal.  thanks.
you like gymnastics?
i was on the team at school.  i was never very good, though.
we are not always as good at things as we would like.
yeah, but i was really not good.
science...i suppose.
a sad choice.
there are times when it does not offer much comfort.  I have seen you before.  sister...?
mary helena.
you do volunteer work at the hospital?
i come from time to time.  when I am needed.
i could have saved them.
only one thing can save the children. the unquiet spirit must be laid to rest.  it is an abomination to god and man.
i beg your pardon?
to who?
does not matter.
c'mon.  let's get out of this rain.
stop blaming yourself.
I am running out of answers. a patient sleepwalks out of a security ward up to a tower with no access.  a girl, alone in a room, dies by jumping six feet straight up into a television set. nothing makes sense anymore.
then maybe you are ready.
for what?
the truth.
try me.
only if you are willing to put aside everything you have learned and trust me. can you do that?
i can do that.
i know who is trying to kill you.
do not fucking humor us.  we are not in the mood.
he wears a dirty brown hat.  he is horribly burned.  he has razors on his right hand.
who is he?
freddy krueger.  he was a child murderer before he died.  after he died, he became ...something worse.  six years ago freddy killed my friends. he almost killed me.  i thought i got rid of him -- but i guess he was too strong.
why is he after us?
yeah?  what did we ever do?
mom and dad?  that's...crazy.  they never said...
oh sure.  that is just the sorta thing parents tell their kids:  "goodnight honey.  do not forget ot say your prayers. oh, by the way, your father and i torched some maniac last night."
so what do we do about this creep?
last time, it was me against him.  i was not strong enough...alone.
i have not been able to do that since i was a little girl.
you did it the other night.
that was different.
you never lose a gift like that.  you just forget how to use it.  how about it?  will you try?
you sound like peter pan.
remember -- open mind.
okay, we are going to try a little group hypnosis.
take us there, kristen.
breathe deeply and relax...starting with your toes, relax everything until there is no tension left in your bodies.  none at all.  keep following the pendulum...
we can try again.
everybody take five.
we are here.
where...here?
we made it.  neil, we made it!
this is not possible.  and even if it is...what the hell am i doing here?  did you drag me in here too?
take it slowly.  remember, this is a dream. anything is possible.
anything?
what is happening?
he is close...
freddy?
he is heavy in the halls...
I am sorry, neil.  you brought this on yourself.
for god's sake, elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  listen to them.
of course.
what are we going to do?
there is nothing we can do.  it is out of our hands.
this wing's been closed for years.  what was this place?
purgatory...fashioned by the hands of men.  twisted, lost souls, the worst of the criminally insane, were locked away in here like animals.
the whole facility was shut down in the forties, was not it?  some kind of scandal...
a young girl on the staff was accidentally locked in here over the holidays.  the inmates managed to keep her hidden for days.  she was raped...hundreds of times. when they found her, she was barely alive...and with child.
my god.
that girl was amanda krueger.  her child --
freddy.
the bastard son of a hundred maniacs. some say he was murdered, though no body was ever found.
you said something before...about laying him to rest...?
you must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
you are not going in.  that is exactly what he wants.  as long as you are on hypnocyl, it is the only way he can get to you.
do not you think i know that?  i do not have any choice.
bullshit.  getting yourself killed will not do the kids any good.  besides, we do have a choice.
assuming your mysterious nun in right.
I have heard crazier things this week.
all right.  whoever she is, I will admit she seems to know more about krueger than i do.
the question is, what happened to freddy's body?
they burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
who would know where they were hidden?
there is only one man...and its time for him to talk.
well, if it is not my little girl... come to visit her daddy.
it is been a long time.
yeah, but here you are.  how did i get so lucky?  i thought you were trying to forget i was alive.
that is not true.  you are the one who is trying to forget.
fred krueger's dead.  you always had a little trouble understanding that, princess.
you know what he did.  he is doing it again.
i think we can stop him this time. stop him for good.  but we need to know where the bones were hidden.
i lost too much over this already.  I am through with it.
people are still dying.  after all this time.  stop running away from it.  daddy, please...don't make me beg.  you owe me.
nancy...
I will be okay.  just give me a minute.
oh christ.  simms put kristen in the quiet room for the night.  they sedated her.
no...
neil, it is no use.  you saw how he is.
just go.  kristen needs you.  keep her awake somehow.  do it.
save your breath, ms. thompson.  dr. simms gave me specific instructions. nobody gets to see kristen -- especially you.  she made that real clear.
but max, she needs me.  it could mean life or death.
i do not know...
it will be my last chance.  pleese?
you got five minutes.
thank you.
what did you do, take the scenic route?
sshhh.  no time for that.  come on.
in there.  charlie penny owns the place. we knew no one would ever find it.  I am not even sure i can find it again.
how do we get in?
they used to keep a spare key.
okay, straight talk only in here.
what about kristen?
we can not get to her.  I have tried.
I am in.
me too.
we have got work to do.
what are you talking about?
you are about to attend a funeral.  one that is long overdue.
you did not think we would let you go alone?
no fuckin' way.  we are a team.
joey needs us.  i can feel him.
how do we find him, kristen?
honey, you will wake the whole neighborhood!
mom?
what are you still doing up?  it is past one.
i thought I would wait for you.
well, I am home now, so you can go right to sleep.  c'mon, angel.
what?
i had such an awful dream.
can we talk?  just for a minute?
can not it wait till morning?
please mom?  i just do not want to be alone.
what is that?
i do not know.
kincaid -- we should find the others first...
you are hot stit with a little mute kid -- let's see you take a piece of me!  krueger!
nancy!
he is too strong!  he was never this strong!
what was that?
what?
listen.
somebody else is out here.
no.  we are alone.
kristen, can you pull us out?
they sedated me.  we are stuck here till it wears off.
let's try this way.
are you okay?
i think so.
it is over.  it is over.
nancy...
crossed over?
but i could not go until i told you how sorry i am for all the things I have done.
he is gone.  it is over.  please do not die, nancy.  please.
I am so proud of you all.  tell neil i...
I am glad things have worked out for you.
i think new york was just what i needed.  so many people.  i never feel alone.
the city that never sleeps.  so what will you do now?
i do not know.  I am busy with school. new friends.  but I will never forget the old ones.
to old friends.  and your new dreams.
to old friends.
it was great seeing you again.  I am glad you dropped by.
do you still...see each other?
yes.  I am going to see her tonight.
