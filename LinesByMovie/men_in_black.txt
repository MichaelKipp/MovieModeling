we will take it from here.
what?  who the hell are you?
ins, washington.  special services.
which do you have your money on, dee?
I would go with number three.
three, huh?  really? cause a cup of coffee says we are talking about... number... four?  huh?  no?
vayanse. you others, go on.
sir--
pasen al-furgon v larguense de aqui! take the van and go.
sir, you can not just--
do not "sir" me-- you have no idea who you are dealing with.
nowhere.
nowhere, huh? odd you would get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
er. well, nowhere special.
i do not believe you, mikey.  and you know why i do not believe you? cause last time you said that you and your pals left eight dozen empty beer cans on the other side of the moon.
yeah, wall, you know, i was just going there... to pick then up.
oh yeah?  well if you are suddenly such a good samaritan, why did not you file a departure report, like you are supposed to?  you know how many rules you have just broken?
i dunno. one?
try seven.  from unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  you wanna tell me what is going on?  huh?
it's... coming.
what are you talking about, it is coming?  what is coming?
mikey.  hold it, mikey-- i want you to talk to me.  mikey.  I am telling you.. do not make me... mikey   gimme the 140.
oh. shit. it is in the car--
what?  i thought you just--
little more burn on the perimeter-they were not roasting smores here. dig out this hole a little.  cmon, i know it is late, but the sooner we get it right, the sooner we will all be home.
kay, I am sorry...
do not worry about it.  four-eyes'll run a track on him.  we will get that son of a... whatever the hell he is the son of.
this is a neurelyser. it was a gift from some friends from out of town. i need you to look at it.  this red eye here isolates and measures the nature of the electronic impulses currently in your brain.  more specifically, the ones -for memory, which it will then block.   i said i need you to look right here.
why?  what are you gonna do?
actually that is a very good question.  the answer-- if you will just look at this part-- is here.
underground gas vein.  next time, be more careful when you shoot off your guns.
what?
you heard me.  you two, especially.
kay, listen, i dunno what got into--
do not worry about it.  it is been a long night.  speaking of which-- you owe me a cup of coffee, remember?
i was not scared...
oh yeah?  the hell you weren't. little pither just out of school...
grab the coffee, will ya?  i told zed I would give him a buzz.
listen-- do me a favor-- do not mention the 140 thing--
do not worry about it.
how is dee?
fine.  good.
so... now what?  cattle call again?
we have got about eight or nine prospects	i want you look--
yeah, I will talk to you.
helluva night, is not it?
yup.  sure is.
sorry, cowan, i found out literally just before the ceremony.' apparently you are to report for further review.
further... what are you talking about, air?  that makes no sense-- i hold three cadet class records--
actually, it did not come from me.
bull... loney- sir.  I am sorry.  sir, I am sorry. sir.  i just, i find it hard to believe that it did not come from you.  i mean, everything here comes from you.
well this didn't.
then where did it-- ? sir.  forgive me, but it makes no sense. worked my ass off to grad--
look. i do not know why.  i could guess, however.  maybe it is your attitude.  or that you are not even close to a team player.  or that you always seen to think you know more than your supervisors.
actually, sir--
cowan.  do you ever think that maybe, just maybe, other people might be right and you might be wrong?
all the time, sir.
you do?
yes, air.  but I am usually wrong. sir.
... think that maybe my supervisors referred me here because of certain issues which i assure you i have spent a good deal of time working very hard to correct--
your supervisors have no idea why you are here.
they don't?
they don't.  now, son.  if you get the job, you are going to be working with some very particular people who like to do things in some very particular ways.  here's a little piece of advice:    do not use this so much.
what is so funny, cadet cowan?
i... i do not know, air.  this guy. mr. "best of the best of the best... " i do not know.  it is just still find it a little...  humorous.  I am sorry.  sir.
well... you know, when you say "normal," what, exactly...
for instance...  it says here you lost your parents at 15, and, since then...
sir.  i thought those records were sealed.
we are the government, cowan.
the hell happened?
hesitated, sir.
I am not talking about that.  I am talking about your choice of targets.
you shot an eight year old girl.
uh... yes.  apparently i did, air.
the hell were you thinking?
well, i dunno.  i mean, when you looked at all the other options... it just seemed sorta obvious.
obvious?  why do not you and i have a little talk about the obvious... outside.
sir, before you boot me, i just want to explain.  i mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
cowan--
wait.  uh-- sir.  please.  anyway.  hook-head-guy.  I am thinking "how can he think with a hook for a head?" answer: that is not his head. then i think--
cowan--
of course not, cause his head is that thing way on the other side of the road, cause, if you looked at it, the entire sidewalk full of stuff was actually one guy and--
cowan-- will you shut your god damed mouth?
yes.  that is true.  actually, at this point, i just want a job.  wait. what do you mean... yet?
it means i know you think you got a beat on things.  but trust me, you don't.  you do not even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what is really going on in the world.    and if you want to find out even a little, you will shut up and come with me. and if you don't, fine.  go with them. cause I am not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I am starting to count on him.  so forgive me if you do not exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this is not the love boat.  and I am not captain fucking stubing.  now I am sorry.  but this has been one long, bad day.
so... this door.  it's... not an exit...  ?
it is not even a fucking door.
...touch that.
what the hell...
kids' game a couple galaxies over.
i guess i lost:
you got smeared.
we have one motto: peace on earth.
and goodwill toward man?
no. just peace on earth.
i gotta be honest about something.
you think we are nuts.
no-- it makes sense.  cause i gotta tell ya, when i was in third grade they told me i was crazy cause i swore that our teacher was from, like, venus or something.
mrs. edelson?
jupiter, actually. well, one of the moons.
so whattya say, kid?  you in or out?
once i thought the biggest thing I will ever do was guard the president.
oh, you will still, be guarding him.
only the damn guy will not know it.
what happens if i say no?
it is easy.  you work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the president, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
and if i say yes?
lose your name and identity, work endless hours an behalf people who do not know you exist, and abandon any hope that you might one day feel even the slightest bit sure of your place in the universe.
from now on, you will respond only to the name "jay." you will dress in appropriate attire specially sanctioned by the ins special services. you are not to stand out in any way.  understand?
yes, sir.
everybody, listen up: we have had a tremendous amount of movement lately. be aware.  be safe.  have a good day.  oh, uh... cowan?
yes, air? -- ooomph.
hell of an assistant, is not he?  damn guy moves so fast, he actually gets there before you even ask for him.
sorta literally gets ahead of himself.
hang on. -- and this is the good part; when you are fully ordained, he will come when you call him, too.  dave.
so... wait.  you just asked... but he goes so fast, he actually brought what you asked for before you asked for it.
his physics are a little different than ours.  do not worry
it will make sense later?
no. but you will get used to it.    welcome to the men in black.
well, how about if i guess, then? black: vast space.  deep. spiritual. the essence of infinity.
we wear black.
oh. right.  i guess that is kind of cool, too, in it is own way.  course, this is not really black; it is kind of a dull, dirty, tarry sort of noncolor, is not it?
the point is to not call attention to ourselves.
i understand.  hey, it works for the hasids, right?  no one recognizes them.
it is a bug.
right.
but not a bug bug-- it is an insect.
so... lemme get this straight.  we got the use of all sorts of technology from all sorts of other planets.  we got information no one else in the world is privy to.  and we are in a 1986 ford ltd about to go look at an insect?
so what is the problem?
well, first of all... i gotta think we could still blend in pretty nice in a ferrari testerrosa.  i mean, there is a lot of `em on the street these days, and... uh...
i tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that would what we would be wearing.  i think it would be a good look for you, too.  I will even help you choose a tattoo.
it is the way we do it.  the way we have always done it.
i know, but we are on a college campus...
this is a college?  I am sorry, i thought it was a carnival.
we are from scientific american.  we read about your discovery.  we would like to take a look.
scientific american?  really?
so, i guess you could say you are really into insects...
actually, they disgust me.  but that is what i love about them.  like a car wrack, you know, how you should not look, but you always pull over and watch real close, or even pretend you are a reporter so you can get even closer and take pictures?
or when someone has a hideous birthmark and all you do is stare.  i really like that.  let the other girls have the guys like you. chiseled jaw, perfect nose, quirky dimples.  i find you all so boring.
I would prefer if you were just a little more blunt.
this it?
yeah.  nov i know it looks normal, but watch this.
i mean, i dunno.  I have seen insects with really great camoflauge ability.  but never like this.
may i have a look?
i think she is the alien.  in any case, she is clearly spent my too much time alone in this room.
keep her out of here while i check it out.
i'm, uh... real curious about your met up here. i see you have the, uh, double-office-type thing going here..
so... how did you hear about this?
oh, yeah, well, you know.  I am a big fan.  I have read all your work.
yeah, right.  even i can barely read all my work.
... recent landings within a hundred mile radius of sudbury, virginia?
nothing.
nothing at all?  now?  last month? anything in the last few years?
nope.  nothing at all.
right, right-- i like that stuff.
with exclusionary frecto-inhibitors?
exactly.  i very much enjoy that.
do have any idea what i just said?
we are with the immigration and naturalization service, intergalactic bureau.  we monitor all-alien activity in and around earth and its enveloping atmosphere.
come again?
hmnn... wall, it is funny, cause usually I am not all that attracted to stupid guys, but--
but, unfortunately, you are even less attracted to guys you have never seen before.
I am just saying it was cold.  i think she kind of liked me.
she did not even know you. .
i know, that is usually the only time i actually have a shot.  and what if i wanted to see her again?  I would have to completely re-introduce myself.
such a shame, too.  cause you made such a good impression the first time.
hey, i was workin' her.  i was workin' my thing.
just so i understand... you are "thing" is... acting like an idiot?  or is it actually being an idiot?  besides--
i know, i know.  i read the manual. no attachments.  we work alone. blah. blah.
if you do not have anyone to tell, you will not tell anyone.  believe me, you get used to it.
i think you are too used to it.  if you ask me, you have been doing this job too long.
you do not know the half of it.
what did you do before this, anyway? wait-- let me guess. ice sculpture? rock?
i taught kindergarten.
ha ha.  no, really.
it was a long time ago.-
well, one thing's for sure.  you could certainly lighten up.
why?
why?  well, it would not hurt you to have a little more fun.  i know i do not know you all that well, but--
you do not know me at all.
um-- kay?
kay, um... how, uh, fast does this thing actually go ... ?
let's see... that was second gear..kay shifts into third.  jay winces.
what?
something seem unusual to you about that?
uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to new mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
if it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
i dunno.  maybe it was baby supplies, kay starts the car, starts to pull a u-turn.
let's check am out.
kay?  what is your 20?
highway 119, just west of smith. why?
i need you in philadelphia.  i got a code 90, in a-high school.
what the hell is going on?
what is this?
it is an edna named after zed's ex wife.  all you do is at the target. the scope matches the image with the image on your retina. the barrel will find the target on its own.
well, mr. intuition... when the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
i guess it is simple, huh?  they are either gone... or dead.
or someone has a nitrogenizer.
a what?
now what?
history's proven that where there is a nitrogenizer, there is a 12-legged signazoid.  they use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
a signazoid's eleven thousand pounds. i think we would know if held left.
then would not we also know if he is here?
hold it.
listen to me. you are holding something very very dangerous. you have just iced 350 of your pals--
they are not my pals--
they are not even going to be your enemie-a if you do not give that to me really soon.
what if i don't?
in about 10 seconds they are going to start losing brain cells at the rate of about a million a minute.
will it lower the curve?
i do not think it is a tradeoff you really want to make.  now give it to me-- i can reverse the effects if you give it to me now.
i wanna make a deal.
found it.
tell us the truth.  you do not just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
i promised i would not tell.
i just wanted to scare em.  so i go in to buy a starter's pistol-- you know, the kind they use at track meets that shoot blanks-- and this guy, he said if i really wanted to mess with with them, he had just the thing...
this guy.  where was he?
he is a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
there is got to be a hundred pawn shops in downtown philadelphia.  i take it there is a reason we are going to this one.
there is a god damn good reason.
what a coincidence, cause i was just thinking about you, too, jack.  recognize this?
no.
maybe you need a closer look.
the kid looked desperate.  i figured...
you figured what?
i figured it did not matter.  it is my last day of business.   i was wrong.  I am sorry.  hey, look what i got for you-- a free-floating plasma pad? --one of the good ones, too, with zoids.
your licence is revoked. permanently.
i understand.  i understand, thank you. --how about a transmographic dexahydrochlorophallomixaloosalyser?
and I am arranging deportation papers.
yes.  yes, that is eminently fair of you.
and I am bringing you in and locking you up until you tell me--
let's go, jeebs.  downtown.
you are not taking me in!
something is wrong here.
gee.  you really think?
jeebs is eager to have me deport him. but would rather kill himself than go downtown. why?
i dunno. why did that family need all their luggage for a dinner?.
why did mikey leave nazca?
and what is this ... ?
what?
looks like a train ticket.
where to?
he is gone, too.
what about the other agents?  ella? tee?
elle's up in portland-- three of her charges left visibly at a trailblazers game.  shots got a lot to mop up.  tee says his shanghai quadrasectionals have not been around since morning.
even that little bug you found in sudbury seems to have taken off.
jesus, everyone's moving.  could be an assembly.  does it look aggressive?
hard to tell.  i hope not.
keep an eye on things there.  we will see what we can find out at ernie goosels.
what is going on, kay?
i do not want to rattle you, but dee was here for the war of the worlds.
the radio show?
no. the aliens organized, all of them, and tried a coup. they made it seem like a radio show afterwards.
you think that is what's-happening?
i think that is what is happening...
ernie goose?  cynthia?
that is the loch ness monster.  and... kay-- that's... 444-eyes?
jesus...
get back in the car!
jesus christ...
we are rising.
they are gone.
dee?  what are you doing here?
I am just wondering what is so great out there that everyone's trying to get to it?
or what is no horrible down here that everyone's trying to avoid it?
why does it feel like the only thing scarier than having a bunch of aliens on the planet... is having then leave the planet?
I am getting a trajectory...
what do we have?  are we showing anything?
where is it coming?  where is he landing?
the pentagon.
and they are buying it?
they went right to the president.
they went to the president? directly? they went over our heads?
now, what are we looking at?  keys.  look at them all.  why do we have them?  mr. president?
well, uh... so we can got into things, i guess.
that is why you have doors, mr. president.  keys, however, are to lock the doors.  and locks, as you know, are to keep people out.  why? fear.  you humans are afraid.  so you set up boundaries.  borders. your car.  your home.  your country.  all the while your true enemy could very well be considered already here among you.  well i am here to let that enemy go.  because there is a border you did not even know existed.  it is the border to the universe.  and unlike your other borders, you humans did not set this border up to keep other planets from you.  it was set up by others, to keep you away from them.  until now.  because i have been sent here to open the door.  to present you, so to speak, with the key to the universe.
why, you might ask?  because you are ready.  because you have finally gone as far as you can go without it.
if i may, sir... what exactly are you offering?
a good question.  and a simple answer.  no more hunger.  no more smog. no more overpopulation.  no more war.
and i assume you are bringing this to us because we are the most powerful country on the planet...
that and, well... i want my friends to see me on cnn.    okay, i will admit it: ours is an illegal hookup.  we will gladly pay when you can get your trucks out to install it.
pardon me.  i hate to break up this lovely little group hug, but we people are not ready for what we have.  how is this going to help?
how could it not?
why do not you ask the mosebacke?     brazil. until 44 years ago they ate with their hands, lived in huts, and did not even know the rest of the world existed. 44 years ago a well intentioned missionary gave them a fork.  today, they do not exist.
come on now.  people are smart.
no-- a person is smart.  people are dumb.    and the more people you put together, the dumber they get.  and you know that.
"perhaps we shoulld take a lesson from our dinosaurs..."
i dunno, man.  maybe we should.
as far as i can tell, the guy's what he says he is - alone, and unarmed.  all he wants is five minutes to introduce himself to the public.
where is he making his big speech?
they have not announced it yet.  all i know is we are in motion for the most watched media event in history.
yeah.  his dream and our worst nightmare.
you know, there is something we never really thought of...
oh, yeah?  fill us in, why do not you.
what if he is telling the truth?
you know something?  i actually never think of that.  i gotta get some coffee.
'hell, i may as well do something useful.
dee, you have been useful for 50 years.  we are clueless, you are tired. why do not you go home and get some rest.
home?  you gotta be kidding me.    black?
sure.
me, too.  i feel a long day coming on.
kay--
hang on.  there is got to be something on this guy.    did you contact the alliance?  do they have anything?
i put word out-- you know how long it takes to get the signals across.
kay.  seriously.  what if he actually means what he says?
he is here to help!?
yes.  well, in his own mind, yeah.  what if, from his point of view, he is?
how does that help me?
well... if you think about it, then it would mean that maybe everything he is saying is true.
great.  fine.  listen, why do not we call the pentagon, maybe they will take you back with the new age well wishers.  I will stay here and go extinct with the dinosaurs.
kay.  all I am saying--
i know what you are saying.  and I am telling you i do not trust him--
i know you do not trust him.  you do not trust anybody--
cause I have been doing this thirty years and if i do not know when something does not feel right by now--
that is my point.  for thirty years you have been looking through things and under things and behind things. well what I am saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  he said our enemy in already here.  well maybe it is.  maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
what are you doing?
everything left the planet, right? except one thing.    that little insect-- the one we found in sudbury.  did it leave when everything else left?
well, it was not in the jar...
did it leave?
actually, i do not know...
oh shit!
dee.  god damn it.  i told you to go home.
kay...
we need to talk to you about the alien.
the what?
once-- just once-- i thought I would made the discovery of a lifetime...
actually, you may have.
it is hard to find.  it is an old civil war cemetery.  nobody ever goes there.  so... what is it you say you do?
i guess you could say we are entopologists of a sort.
i do not think so.   i mean, him, he could be a scientist, maybe.  but you...  exterminator, I would understand.  but entopolgist?  no way.
why not?
well, first of all, it is entomologist.
which way?
seriously.  I am not going any further until you tell who you are.
yeah?  what is up?
i got a planet check on that bug.  it is from way the hell out in the third belt. it is organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
and get this: you know how humans evolved from primates?  well guess what the dominant life form on planet evolved from?
do not tell me.  insects.
how did you know?
just a guess.  but i think found a nest.
i swear to god, that was not here two days ago...
what is it?
it is the most amazing insect nest I have ever seen.  and I will tell you one thing, it sure as hell am not the andean mollatoosa.
but it is definitely a nest, is not it?
man, hey-- maybe you are an entopologist after all.
since how long?
since as long as we have been keeping records...
when?
it would have had to have been recently-- within a few weeks.
so... how did they get here?
maybe they did not get here.  maybe they have been here.
for how long?
we saw it in the office.  it went from this big...    to big...   in a day.
well, if the bugs have hatched, and they are not here... then where are they?
it is marble.
all of it?
i know what this is.    zed, you in?
yeah, kay?
did our friend announce when he is making his speech?
noon exactly.
did he say where?
actually, yeah--
would not happen to be the lincoln memorial, would it?
how did you know that?  kay?
cause i think we are looking at it.
would you call this a code 100?
I would double it and add 20.
really nice wheels, by the way.
wait-- listen--
I am going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  you guys get to the memorial.   keep this stuff hidden.  the last thing we need is some over-zealous secret service twirp to...
do his job.
right.  oh, and here.
wow... this one's cool.  and it looks just like a shotgun.
actually, it is a shotgun.  hold onto it--
in case i need it?
in case i need it.
what do we do?
what do we do?    lean into it.
what the hell does that mean?
actually... i do not know.
not bad.  briliiant, actually.  you come unarmed, and alone.  cause your army's been growing underground for what? 100 years? 150?
give or take.  it was right around your civil war, i think, when i was here last.  we were waiting till your planet was warm enough.
is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
out of focus?
goodwill...
most entirely.  earth has been overrun with an infestation of a species which, in order for the planet to survive, must be exterminated.
do it!  shoot him!
kay!?
okay.  if you have got a bug problem-a big one.  and they are swarming and there is no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
the only thing i could think of would be... you would have to get rid of the queen.
what if you have the foggiest clue as to where the queen is?
are you sure you don't?
what are you doing?
they respond to fear, right?
yeah ... ?
well I am going to give them something to be afraid of.
you were saying?
getting eaten!? that was your plan!?
after i got the shit beat out of me!
and i almost got digested. it goes with the job.
you coulda told me what you were doing.
there was not time, sport!
who is she going to tell, anyway? she only hangs out with dead people.
not her. me.    they are beautiful, are not they? the stars. i never just look anymore and they are beautiful.
kay, you are scaring your partner.
i have not been training a partner -- I have been training a replacement.
oh no, i can not do this job by myself.
