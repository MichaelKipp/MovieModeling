how comes it your are not afraid?
would'st you harm one who comes to aid you?
I have come to strike a bargain with you.  i wish to learn the power of changing.
and what would'st i gain from this bargain?
your life.
how?
we had a bargain.  you promised.
i lied.
it flatters me you remember, old one. it is been what... two hundred years?
it is not been long enough.  what witchcraft is this?
impressive -- is it not?  the problem is i can only keep the illusion for a few minutes.  i need more power to hold the form longer.  i need the highlander.  where is he?
i do not know -- and even if i did...
i know.  i know-- you would not tell me.  loyalty -- it really is a concept that eludes me.  oh well -- i shall find him.  time is on my side.
oh -- i almost forgot.  your head.
it does not come off as easily as the young ones.
perhaps -- but it comes off none the less.
you know it is not safe here for you.
i know.
the police still have a lot of questions for russell nash.
i can take care of myself.
it is not over, is it, conner?
no.
how can that be?
i do not know.
is there anything else you need?
no -- I am fine.  thank you.
I am glad you have come home, conner.
me too.
it will be a good harvest this year.
can you really tell from doing that?
what do you think?
i think you just like to eat dirt.
would you care for some water, conner?
aye -- that i would, lass.
i think my sarah fancies you, conner.
she is a treasure she is.
she will soon be of age.
your words are kind and they flatter me -- but i think of her as a sister. besides, you hardly know me.
i know that for six months you have worked hard and asked for little. that you are a good and honest man. what more need i know?
this cannot be.
it is.  do not ask me how.  i do not know.  i must leave, for if i stayed others would surely hear of this and worse than they will come.
agreed.
i would like to say goodbye.
how?
do not leave us, conner.
it is not for me to decide.
do not cry, wee one.  it is a better place i go to.
i love you, conner.
aye -- i know, las -- and i have never loved anyone more.
I will no forget you.
and i you.  go now.  let me walk to heavens door alone.
electro magnetic soundings indicate we have only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.
any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
huge.
what are you hoping to find inside?
you guys are from the british museum, right?
no -- we are from strange facts and mysteries.  it is a syndicated show out of..
paul.  i thought we agreed.  no press.
just a little.  who knows what we are going to find in there.  it could be a huge excavation.  a little friendly pr never hurt.
where is the film crew from the british museum?
they have had a little car trouble. I am afraid they will not be here until after dark.
then we should not break into the cavern until tomorrow morning.  this could be a very important find.  i want it documented.
you will have no need for that, highlander.
since we hardly know each other, I am sure you will understand if i hold one to it for awhile.
caution shows wisdom.
i know that weapon.  it belonged to juan romeriz.  he is dead?
aye.
you?
no.  he was my brother.  he died at anothers hand.
we too are brothers, macleod.  in fact, you have more family than you think.
who are you?
thomas cavenaugh.  i am a teacher of sorts.  like romeriz i help those newly acquainted with our life.
i learned my fill from romeriz.
indeed you did.  and now it is time for you to pass on to others what you learned from him.
the prize?  so much blood so that in the end the one that remains will be mortal again.  so much pain so that the winner can grow old and have children.  the prize hardly seems worth the cost of it.
there will be more to the prize than that.  power will come with it -- and it must be used for good.
the days of magic are ending.  the world is changing.
aye -- yet one such as i who has wandered this world for nearly nine centuries can remember back to other days of change.  days of robin of the hood and arthur pendragon.  they were real enough once, but they drifted into men's dreams and became legend - - as we shall do one day.
you cannot run from your destiny, conner.
perhaps -- but if i must face it, let it find me, for i shall search for it no more.
we are holding the workers down below.
why?
someone broke into the cavern last night.
what?  how?
he is fine.  he swears he never left his post for a moment.  he heard a noise and when he went back to look they were already inside.
how could they get by him?
i do not know.
we found him this morning.
what is that next to him?
his head.  someone cut it off.
incredible.  the cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  it is a remarkable duplication.
i do not think it is a duplication.
it has to be.
and this?
you kept it?
yes.
must you do that?
what?
sing.
it is a beautiful day.  i am merely enjoying it.
can not you enjoy it quietly?
are you always this pleasant?  you know what you are problem is?
you?
life.  you have stopped living it.  you look, but you do not see.  you listen but, you do not hear.
i hear you.
what else?  what else do you hear right now?
the river.
that is all?
yes.
do you not hear the wind in the trees?  the songs of the birds.  the horses breath?  there is a whole world around you. alive.  living.  feel it -- become part of it.  live your life, highlander.  it is going to be a long one.
that is what bothers me.
i see.  you do not care about life anymore.
I am leaving.
leaving what?
england.  there is nothing for me here anymore.
and what do you think you will find in another land?
maybe myself.
then it is worth the journey.
thank you, thomas.
for what?
for being a friend when i needed one. i hope our paths cross again.
I am sure they will.
as friends -- always as friends.
we cannot write our destiny, macleod. in the end it could be you and me.
that is a thought that does not please me.
if it came down to it what would you do?
i do not know.  i pray that i shall never have to raise my sword against one that i call friend.
did you find a sword?  an old sword?
yeah -- how did you know that?
you stayed here again last night?
i was working on the cataloging.
jennifer, there is more to life than work.
i know, paul.
do you?  then why do not you go out? meet someone.  make a life for yourself instead of hiding away in the past?
i like my work.
I am having some people over tonight for dinner -- I would like you come.
we will see.
good afternoon, mr. parker.
good afternoon...  ... shirley.
would you like to deposit this in your account?
no.  the money, please.
this check is for sixteen thousand dollars.  that is a lot of cash to be carrying around.
i can take care of myself.
alright.  it is going to take a few minutes.  i have to call and verify the funds.
what are you doing?
i should not have come back here.  it was a mistake.
is it a mistake for someone to go to the ones who love them when they are in trouble?
yes -- when their troubles can harm them.
why will not you ever let anyone help you?
detective bedsoe.
lieutenant.
congratulations.
when did you get back?
a few days ago.
that is what i figured.  well, i have a little home coming present for you.
where were you last night around nine?
i already told you.  i took a walk.
tell me again.  where did you go?
central park.
does not it scare you walk through the park at night?
no.  i do not scare easy.
where have you been for the last seven years?
around.
and brenda?
she was a good woman.
you did not bring me here to talk about her.
no.
i brought you here to talk about him. do you know him?
no.
you sure?
he does not look familiar -- but then he would probably be easier to identity with his head.
I am in the middle of an interrogation, captain.
interrogation's over, bedsoe.
what?
cut him loose.  the d.a. says you am not got shit on this guy.
you do not understand.  about seven years ago we found the body of a guy named vasilnic in jersey.  a week later in the parking lot of madison square garden we found iman fasil. three days after that luman castageer was found in an alley.  the fourth body we have never been able to identify.  all four men died from decapitation.  nash was our primary suspect -- but he disappeared.
it is circumstantial.
for chrissake!  gimme a break.  the guy disappears for seven years and as soon as he comes back it starts again.
i see your point, bedsoe, but i have to look at this from the law's point of view.  there is something missing here.  it is something I am sure you have come across many times in your career.  it is called evidence.  get me a murder weapon with his fingerprints on it.  find me an eye witness.  dig up a motive.  until then we do not have a case against him.
lieutenant bedsoe?
not now.  I am busy.
I am going to nail you, nash.  that is a promise.
is that it?
no.  I am telling you right now, the next person's head that comes off is going to be yours.
lieutenant, you are really frightening me.
get outta here.
lieutenant?
what?  who are you?  what do you want?
my name is jennifer hillman.  I am an archaeologist.  i read in the paper about the murder yesterday and i thought i should come talk to you.
talk to me about what?
what do you think?
they appear to be authentic.
why are people walking around new york with swords, dressed in mid evil clothing?
well, technically it is not mid evil - - it is renaissance.
hey lieutenant, the boys in robbery have something i think you should look at.
what is it?
a tape from the surveillance camera at the first national bank.  it was robbed this morning.
really?  i want to make sure that i understand what you are telling me, greley.  a crime was committed in new york city?  that is news.
the guy had a sword and was dressed like this guy.
that is not all, lieutenant.  wait until you see the tape.  it is unbelievable.
I would like you to see this.
what the hell.  what is this?  a joke?
no joke, lieutenant.
where is the guy we saw in the beginning -- what is his name...?
parker.  we found him knocked out in the can.
if he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby?
hey, i do not have answers for this. i just brought you down here because of the sword.
am i supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
you can believe what you want.  you saw the tape.
you did not see this.  understand?
yes.
you are looking a wee bit green, thomas.
the sea and i do not agree with each other.  where we off to?
france.
how long is the voyage?
not long.  we should arrive in the morning.  are you going to be alright?
me?  of course.
good -- also, give it to the papers and tv.
y'know, the guys in robbery are going to get kind of upset.  we are stepping on their toes of this one.
tough.
it is not a homicide, lieutenant.
this ties in with nash.
we do not have any proof of that.
i do not need proof.  i know it.  send it out.
my name is jennifer hillman.  i was at the police station earlier today--
i remember you.
i was wondering if i could talk to you?
are you a cop?
no.  I am an archaeologist.
what do you want?
to talk to you.
i do not think we have anything to talk about, miss hillman.
corpses?
yes.  we found another man outside a site we were working at in scotland.
in the highlands?
yes.  how did you know?
a lucky guess.
i do not think so -- but then, maybe you have can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the first national bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
he was wearing a bullet proof vest.
bullet proof vests do not bleed.
you got me.
why do i feel that you know what is going on?
are you the type of person who takes advice, miss hillman?
if it is good advice.
this is.  go home.  stay out of this.
why?  what is going on?
where did you get it?
it is mine.  it is been in my family for years.  it belonged to my great, great, great grandmother.
i heard voices downstairs.  is everything alright?
fine.
what will you do?
there is nothing i can do.  I will wait. one way or another soon it will all be over soon.
what are we doing here?
living.  remember?
you may be living -- but this suit is killing me.
to ask her to dance.
she is the king's cousin.
then she should be an excellent dancer.
aye?
where do you go when your mind drifts?
different places.
the past?
sometimes.
why is it you never talk to me about scotland -- your life there.
because it is the past -- and things that are in the past are best left there.
yes.
what worries you?
you.
you have been seeing her for over a month now.  have you learned nothing from the past?
I have learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
so, you do this for yourself?  what about her?  you cannot not have a relationship, macleod.  you have told me of your wife, heather, and how you loved her. romeriz warned you then, but you would not listen.  you watched her grow old and die -- and there was nothing you could do.
that was two hundred and fifty years ago -- and the pain still scars your heart.  would you live that pain again?
no.  what am i to do?
the only thing you can do.  you must end it.
i cannot stay.
why not?
I am leaving in the morning.
leaving?  for how long?
you will no see me again.
why?
i cannot explain.
do you love me, conner?
aye.
then take me with you.
where I am going you cannot follow.
why are you doing this?
because, it is for the best.  there are somethings that are better left unexplained.
well?
it is done.
I will go first.
no -- i will.
i stood up first.
that does not matter.
you always get to go first.
you can go first.
no -- after you.
highlander -- i had hoped it would be you.
this cannot be.
i am stronger than you, highlander.
that is what the kurgan said.
the kurgan was a pussy.
fine -- I have waited over three centuries.  i can wait a little longer.
why did you wait?
it was not by choice.  a small matter of a mountain falling down on us.  we were trapped inside.  when the time of the gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands.  what you thought was the end -- was not.  this is the end.  we are the last of our kind, macleod.
it will not end tonight.
you cannot hide from me.  you will not stand between me and my destiny. after i have your head the power will let me hold any form as long as i want.  do you know what that means? i can become the president -- i can become anyone i want.  the world will be mine.
you are hurt.
I will be fine.
what is going on?  why did he call you macleod?
because it is my name.
then who is russell nash?
i do not know anymore.
i could have ended it tonight, but i didn't.
why?
i do not know.  he is the stronger one.  he has a power--
you also have a power, conner.  it is why you have survived.
do not underestimate the power of your heart.  your dreams live there.
my dreams died long ago.
did they?  you are only a man, different than most -- but still a man.  you feel the same -- want the same.  you want to live.
i have not lived life -- I have hidden from it.  I have existed in the shadows.
and now it is time to come out of the shadows.
dear, sweet, rachel.  men's lifes are measured by the good they do.
if you search your heart you know all the good you have done.  your strength comes from your heart -- because in your heart you know what you are fighting for is good and just.  this room is filled with memories. if you search through them you can find the good -- the difference you have made.  and now, it is for you to make the greatest difference of all. look in your heart, conner -- and you will see the good that you have done.
anything from the bank?
we sent the prints we lifted from the counter at the bank to the state computers, the fbi and interpol. nothing.
he had to come from somewhere.
i think it was england.
why?
i asked the state department to check with our embassies and interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank.  two weeks ago in london charles redder from the bronx was mugged in hyde park.
so?
you are a very persistent woman, miss hillman.
jennifer.
why do you stare at me like that?
you remind me of someone i used to know.
i do not have any answers for you.
who was that man last night?
i do not know.
then how did he know your name?
do you always walk around with a sword?
new york is dangerous place.
you talk to me -- but you do not answer my questions.  i guess I will have to talk to lieutenant bedsoe.
about what?
it probably would not interest you. it is something i read in a mythology book.
I am interested in mythology.
have you ever heard of the calan?
no.
you look like you have.
yes.
meet me tratino's at nine.
why?
i told you I am interested in mythology.  we can talk about it more.
good evening.
you are twenty minutes late.
sorry.
you did not answer my question.
i know.
you have an interesting accent. where are you from?
why?
I am just trying to place you.
I have lived all over the world.
you are not an easy person to get to know.
why?  because i do not give up all my secrets?
how come you wanted to meet tonight?
i wanted to get to know you better.
that makes you uncomfortable?
a little -- yes.  my interest in coming here is profession.
is it?
yes -- it is.
alright.  in the shop you mentioned something about--
--the calan.  do you know who they are?
why do not you tell me.
have you told lieutenant bedsoe your theory?
no.
why not?
because i do not feel like sitting in a rubber room for forty-eight hours.
you do not really believe this do you?
let me ask you something else.  at the excavation site in scotland, the tunnel leading into the cavern had collapsed.  the day we found the body someone had moved the rocks, making a hole in the collapsed section.  what bothers me is that we found the rocks from the hole on our side of the tunnel wall.
so?
why would someone pull on the rocks to get in the cavern?  they were wedged in tight.  they could not get a grip on them.  they would have had much more strength pushing on them.
if they pushed the rocks you would have found them on the other side of the cavern wall.
yes -- if they were trying to get in -- but what if they weren't?  what if they were trying to get out?
that would mean they would been trapped in there--
--for three hundred years.
how could that be?  people do not live for three hundred years.
not unless they are immortal.
would you like to see it?
I have seen it.
on the back it has--
--the crest of a lion and a dragon and a single word:  courage.
how did you know that?
it came from your great, great, great grandmother, isabelle tourez, who lived in paris and died on the guillotine in 1789 -- alone -- and unmarried.  the ring was given to her by someone who loved her -- but knew that it could never be.
you?
you wanted the truth -- now you have it.
and the other one -- he is like you?
he is immortal -- yes -- but he is not like me.  we are the last of our kind.  the last of the calans.  i do not know what purpose we were put here for.  i only know that if he wins the world will suffer for it.
where will you go now?
it will end tonight.
must you fight him?
he will not stop until it is over.
good evening, lieutenant.
no -- it isn't.  a cop died today and the other is barely holding on.  i want some answers, nash.
I am sorry about that -- but i had nothing to do with it.
that does not mean you do not know what is going on.  you are connected to this guy somehow.  he is after you -- just like the others were.
it is late.
seven years ago i interviewed a guy. he said he saw two men fighting in an alley with swords.  one cut off the others head.  he shot the surviving guy twenty times and he got right back up and stabbed him.
maybe he was a lousy shot.
most people would show some sign of fear with a gun in their face.
most people are afraid of death.
he is in there!
get out.
be careful, conner.
conner?
yes -- i think it is.
hey -- somebody want to gimme a hand here?
what now?
now i can start to live.  to feel. to grow old and live each day without the promise of another.
sounds very -- normal.
