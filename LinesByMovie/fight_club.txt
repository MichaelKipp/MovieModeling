one minute.  this is the beginning.  we are at ground zero.  maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
... i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
it is getting exciting now.
that old saying, how you always hurt the one you love, well, it works both way.
we have front row seats for this theater of mass destruction.  the demolitions committee of project mayhem wrapped the foundation columns of ten buildings with blasting gelatin.  in two minutes, primary charges will blow base charges, and those buildings will be reduced to smoldering rubble.  i know this because tyler knows this.
look what we have accomplised.  thirty seconds.
somehow, i realize all of this -- the gun, the bombs, the revolution -- is really about marla singer.
this was a support group for men with testicular cancer.  the big moosie slobbering all over me was bob.
we are still men.
yes.  we are men.  men is what we are.
six months ago, bob's testicles were removed.  then hormone therapy.  he developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  that was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of god's as big.
they are going to have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid.
I am going to need you out-of-town a little more this week.  we have got some "red-flags" to cover.
it must have been tuesday.  he was wearing his "cornflower-blue" tie.
you want me to de-prioritize my current reports until you advise of a status upgrade?
you need to make these your primary "action items."
he was full of pep.  must have had his grande latte enema.
here are your flight coupons.  call me from the road if there are any snags.  your itinerary...
no, you can not die of insomnia.
maybe i died already.  look at my face.
you need to lighten up.
can not you give me something?
red-and-blue tuinal, lipstick-red seconals.
you need healthy, natural sleep. chew valerian root and get some more exercise.
I am in pain.
you want to see pain?  swing by first methodist tuesday nights.  see the guys with testicular cancer.  that is pain.
bob was a champion bodybuilder.  you know that chest expansion program you see on tv?  that was his idea.
...using steroids.  i was a juicer. diabonol, then, wisterol -- it is for racehorses, for christsake.  now I am bankrupt, divorced, my two grown kids will not return my calls...
strangers with this kind of honesty make me go a big rubbery one.
tonight, we are going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...
i was not really dying, i was not host to cancer or parasites; i was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
...and you open the door and you step inside.  we are inside our hearts.  now, imaging your pain as a white ball of healing light.  that is right, the pain itself is a ball of healing light.
-- but, in here, in everyone, there is the squint of a five-day headache. yet they forced themselves to be positive.  they never said "parasite;" they said "agent."  they always talked about getting better.
okay, everyone.
if i did have a tumor, I would name it marla.  marla...the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would heal if only you could stop tonguing it, but you can't.
now, find your power animal.
we need to talk.
sure.
I am on to you.  you are a faker.  you are not dying.
what?
okay, in the sylvia plath philosophy way, we are all dying.  but you are not dying the way chloe is dying.
tell the other person how you feel.
you are a tourist.  i saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer.
and i saw you practicing this...
practicing what?
telling me off.  is it going as well as you hoped... ?  "... mr. taylor."
I will expose you.
go ahead.  I will expose you.
why are you doing this?
it is cheaper than a movie, and there is free coffee.
these are my groups.  i was here first.  I have been coming for a year.
a year?  how did you manage that?
anyone who might have noticed either died or recovered and never came back.
i... i do not know.  i guess... when people think you are dying, they really listen, instead...
-- instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
yeah.
it becomes an addiction.
really?
look, i can not cry with a faker present.
candy-stripe a cancer ward.  it is not my problem.
please.  can not we do something... ?
we will split up the week.  you can have lymphoma, tuberculosis and --
you take tuberculosis.  my smoking does not go over at all.
i think testicular cancer should be no contest.
well, technically, i have more of a right to be there than you.  you still have your balls.
you are kidding.
i do not know -- am i?
I will take the parasites.
you can not have both parasites.  you can take blood parasites --
i want brain parasites.
okay.  I will take blood parasites and organic brain dementia --
i want that.
you can not have the whole brain!
so far, you have four and i only have two!
then, take blood parasites.  it is yours.  now we each have three.
so, we each have three -- that is six. what about the seventh day?  i want ascending bowel cancer.
the girl had done her homework.
that is your favorite, too?  tried to slip it by me, eh?
we will split it.  you get it the first and third sunday of the month.
deal.
looks like this is goodbye.
let's not make a big thing out of it.
um... marla, should we maybe exchange numbers?
should we?
in case we want to switch nights.
i suppose.
two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
pardon me?
this is how i met --
tyler durden.
you know why they have oxygen masks on planes?
no, supply oxygen?
oxygen gets you high.  in a catastrophic emergency, we are taking giant, panicked breaths...
what do you do, tyler?
what do you want me to do?
i mean -- for a living.
why?  so you can say, "oh, that is what you do." -- and be a smug little shit about it?
you see, when you travel, everything is small, self-contained--
the spork.  i get it.  you are very clever.
thank you.
how is that working out for you?
what?
being clever.
well, uh... great.
keep it up, then.  keep it right up.
throwers do not worry about ticking. modern bombs do not tick.
excuse me?  "throwers?"
baggage handlers.  but when a suitcase vibrates, the throwers have to call the police.
my suitcase was vibrating?
nine time out of ten, it is an electric razor.  but, every once in a while ...  ...it's a dildo.  it is airline policy not to imply ownership in the event of a dildo.  we use the indefinite aricle: "a dildo."  never "your dildo."
i had everything in that bag.  my c.k. shirts... my d.k.n.y. shoes...
yeah, uh huh... yeah?  oh...
hello?
who is this?
tyler?
who is this?
uh... I am sorry.  we met on the plane.  we had the same briefcase. i'm... you know, the clever guy.
oh, yeah.
i just called a second ago.  there was no answer.  I am at a payphone.
i star-sixty-nined you.  i never pick up my phone.  what is up?
well... let me see... here's the thing...
you buy furniture.  you tell yourself: this is the last sofa I will ever need.  no matter what else happens, I have got the sofa issue handled.  then, the right set of dishes.  the right dinette.
this is how we fill up our lives.
i guess so.
and, now it is gone.
all gone.
could be worse.  a woman could cut off your penis while you are asleep and toss it out the window of a moving car.
there is always that.
i do not know, maybe I am wrong.  maybe it is a terrible tragedy.
...no ...no ...
i mean, you did lose a lot of nice, neat little shit.  the trendy paper lamps, the euro-trash shelving unit, am i right?
but maybe, just maybe, you have been delivered.
delivered from swedish furniture.
delivered from armchairs in obscure green stripe patterns.
delivered from martha stewart.
delivered from bullshit colors like "cobalt," "ebony," and "fuchsia."
insurance'll cover it.
oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
what list?
the "now i get to go out and buy the exact same stuff all over again" list.  that list.
i don't... think so.
this time maybe get a widescreen tv. you will be occupied for weeks.
well, i have to file a claim...
the things you own, they end up owning you.
do not i?
do what you like.
god, it is late.  i should find a hotel...
a hotel?
yeah.
so, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
i do not follow...
we are on our third pitcher of beer. just ask me.
huh?
you called me so you could have a place to stay.
no, i...
why do not you cut the shit and ask if you can stay at my place?
would that be a problem?
is it a problem for you to ask?
can i stay at your place?
yes, you can.
thank you.
you are welcome.  but, i want you to do me one favor.
what is that?
i want you to hit me as hard as you can.
what?
i want you to hit me as hard as you can.
they are called "cigarette burns."
it is called a "changeover."  the movie goes on, and nobody in the audience has any idea.
why would anyone want this shitty job?
it affords him other interesting opportunities.
-- like splicing single frames from adult movies into family films.
in reel three, right after the courageous dog and the snooty cag -- who have celebrity voices -- eat out of a garbage can, there is the flash of tyler's contribution...
one-forty-eighth of a second.  that is how long it is up there.
no one really knows that they have seen it. but they did.
a nice, big cock.
only a hummingbird could have caught tyler at work.
he was the guerrilla terrorist of the food service industry.
do not watch.  i can not if you watch.
... oh, yeah.  oh, yeah.
he farted on meringue; he sneezed on braised endive; and, with creme of mushroom soup, well...
go ahead.  say it.
you get the idea.
i do not know about this.
i do not know, either.  i want to find out.  I have never been hit, have you?
no.  that is a good thing, is not it?
i do not want to die without any scars.  how much can you really know about yourself if you have never been in a fight?  come on... you are the only person I have ever asked.
me?
why not you?  I am letting you go first.  do it.
this is crazy.
alright, go crazy.  let 'er rip.
where do you want it?  in the face?
surprise me.
shit.  sorry.  that did not count.
like hell.  that counted.
how do you feel?
strange.
but a good strange.
is it?
we have crossed the threshold.  you want to call it off?
call what off?
the fight.
what fight?
this fight, pussy.
if you could fight anyone... one on one, whoever you wanted, who would you fight?
anyone?
anyone.
my boss, probably.  who would you fight?
my dad.  no question.
oh, yeah.  i did not know my dad.  well, i knew him, till i was six.  he went and married another woman, had more kids. every six years or so he would do it again -- new city, new family.
he was setting up franchises.  my father never went to college, so it was really important that i go.
i know that.
after i graduated, i called him long distance and asked, "now what?"  he said, "get a job."  when i turned twenty-five, i called him and asked, "now what?"  he said, "i do not know. get married."
same here.
a generation of men raised by women. I am wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
where is your car?
what car?
i do not know how tyler found the house, but he would been there for half a year.
the previous occupant had been a bit of a shut-in.
hum.
what?
oh, a new riot control grenade...  "...the successful combination of concussive, 3000 foot-candle flash- blasts and simultaneous high-velocity disbursement of...blah, blah, blah..."
"i am joe's lungs."  it is written in first person.  "without me, joe could not take in oxygen to feed his red blood cells."  there is a whole series -- "i am joe's prostate."
"i get cancer, and i kill joe."
what are you reading?
soldier of fortune.  business week. new republic.
show-off.
after fight club, everything else in your life gets the volume turned down.  you can deal with anything.
have you finished those reports?
yes.
a guy came to fight club for the first time, his ass was a wad of cookie dough.  after a few weeks, he was carved out of wood.
if you could fight any celebrity?
alive or dead?
does not matter.
hemingway.  you?
shatner.  william shatner.
fight club became the reason to cut your hair short and trim your fingernails.
any historical figure.
okay... ghandi.
good answer.
you?
abe lincoln.  big reach.  skinny guys fight till they are burger.
where have you been the last few weeks?
marla?
how did you find me?
the forwarding number.  i have not seen you at any support groups.
that is the idea -- we split them.
you have not been going to yours.
i found a new one.
really?
it is for men.
like testicular cancer?
look, this is a bad time...
I have been going to debtor's anonymous.  you want to see some truly fucked up people?
I am just on my way out...
me too.  i got a stomach full of xanax.  i took what was left of a bottle.  might have been too much.
picture yourself watching marla singer throw herself around her crummy apartment.
this is not a for-real suicide thing. this is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
this could go on for hours.
so you are staying in tonight?
do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
what are you doing here?
what... ?
what the hell are you doing here?
unbelievable, huh?
he was obviously able to handle it.
i mean, this girl... uh, you are not into her or anything... ?
no.  not at all.
you are sure?
yeah, I am sure.
good.  this chick was up on the table with her legs in the stirrups before the doctor even walked in the room. the things that she said... I have never heard a woman talk like that...
you are okay with this?
I am fine.
she is a wild, twisted bitch.  stay away from that one.
oh, and my pace is more librarians.
hey... do not knock librarians.
marla does not need a lover.  she needs a case worker.
she needs an exorcist.  this is not love.  this is sport-fucking.
she would invaded my support groups, now she is invading my home.
listen... do me a favor... sit here a minute...
what?
you have got to understand something about me.  i have a little rule, okay?  do not ever talk to her about me.  ever.  i can not stand that kind of shit.
if you ever say anything about me or about what happens here in this house, to her or anyone -- i will find out.  and you will never see me again.  promise me.
okay.
promise you won't.
yes, i promise.
promise?
i said i promise!
that was three times you promised.
you want to finish her off?
uh... nah...
is that your blood?
some of it, yes.
... and you come home to this.
you fucking slut!!
this is detective stern with the arson unit.  we have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.
yes?
i do not know if you are aware... your front door -- it seems someone sprayed freon into the lock, then tapped it with a chisel to shatter the cylinder.
no, i was not aware...
i am jack's cold sweat.
does this sound strange to you?
yes, sire, strange.  very strange.
the dynamite...
dynamite?
yes.  it left a residue of ammonium oxalate and potassium perchloride. do you know what that means?
what does that mean?
it means it was homemade.
this is... really a shock...
whoever set this homemade dynamite could have blown out the pilot light days before the explosion.  the gas, it seems, was just a detonator.
who do you think could have done this?
I will ask the questions, son.
huh?
"the liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
shhhhhh!  i do not know what to make of this, sir, i really don't...
no.  no, sir.  i loved that condo. i loved every stick of furniture. the lamps, the chairs, the rugs, were me.  the dishes were me.  the plants were...
I would like to thank the academy...
well, if any ideas come to you, give me a call.  in the meantime, do not leave town.  i may need to bring you in for questioning.
except for their humping, tyler and marla were never in the same room.
i got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
worth every penny.
like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
it suits you.
you get rid of her.
do not mention me.
it is time for you to leave.
do not worry, I am leaving.
you are such a nutcase, i can not even begin to keep up.
goodbye.
what is this place?
a liposuction clinic.
as the fat renders, the tallow floats to the surface.  remember the crap they taught you in boy scouts.
hard to imagine you in boy scouts.
this clear layer in glycerin.  we will mix it back in when we make the soap.
tyler's kiss was a bonfire on the back of my hand.
look at your hand.
guided meditation worked for cancer, it could work for this.
stop it.  this is your pain -- your burning hand.  it is right here.  look at it.
i was going to my cave to find my power animal.
i... i think i understand.  i think i get it...
no, what you are feeling is premature enlightenment.
this is the greatest moment of your life and you are off somewhere, missing it.
no, I am not...
shut up.  our fathers were our models for god.  and, if our fathers bailed, what does that tell us about god?
i do not know...
listen to me.  you have to consider the possibility that god does not like you, he never wanted you.  in all probability, he hates you.  this is not the worst thing that can happen...
it isn't... ?
we do not need him...
we don't... ?
... marla ... ?
fuck damnation.  fuck redemption.  we are god's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.
i must have left the original in the copy machine.
"the second rule of fight club... is this yours?
hmm?
you do not get paid to abuse the copy machine.
"abuse" the copy machine.  there is an image.
pretend you are me.  you find this. what would you do?
what are you talking about?
would you do something for me?  i need you to check and see if there is a lump in my breast.  i can not afford to throw money away on a doctor.
i do not know ...
please.
she did not call tyler.  I am neutral in her book.
this is a sweet side of you.  picking these up for ...  "mrs. haniver" and... "mrs. raines." where are they?
tragically, they are dead.  I am alive and I am in poverty.  you want any?
no, thanks.
good.
where?  here?
here.
there?
here.
here.
feel anything?
no.
make sure.
okay.  okay, I am sure.
you feel nothing?
nothing.
well, that is a relief.  thank you.
no... no problem.
i wish i could return the favor.
i think everything's okay here.
i could check your prostate.
uh ... nah.
well... thanks, anyway.
cornelius!  how are you?
bob.  I am okay.  how are you?
better than I have ever been in my life.
really?  great.  still "remaining men together?"
no.  i found something new.
really, what is that?
the first rule is... you are not supposed to talk about it...
oh.
and the second rule about it is... you are not supposed to talk about it. and the third rule...
bob, bob... I am a member.
you are?!
look at my face.
that is a fucking great, man!  fucking great! congratulations.
yeah, both of us.
you know about the guy who invented it? i hear all kinds of things. supposedly, he was born in a mental institution.  they say he only sleeps one hour a night.  you know about this guy?  tyler durden?
no thanks, i quit.
you quit?
yeah.  where you headed?
work.  going to work.
what... ?
nothing.  do what you like.
we need to talk.
okay.  where to begin?  with your constant absenteeism?  with your unpresentable appearance?  you are up for review...
i am jack's complete lack of surprise.
let's pretend.  you are the department of transportation, and you discover that our company intentionally did nothing about leather seats cured in third world countries with chemicals we know cause birth defects?  brake linings that fail after a thousand miles.  fuel injectors that burn people alive.
just who the fuck do you think you are?!  get out!  you are fired!
what about this?  keep me on payroll as an outside consultant.  in exchange for my salary, I will keep my mouth shut.  i will not need to come to the office.  i can do this job from home.
six months advance pay.  six months!
fucking sweet.
okay, and... and...
who told you motherfuckers you could use my place?
we have a deal worked out with irvine.
irvine?  irvine's at home with a broken collarbone.
he do not own this place, i do.  how much money's he getting for this?
there is no money.
really?
it is free to all.
am not that something?
yes, it is.
look, stupid fuck, i want everyone outta here now!
you are welcome to join our club.
did you hear what i just said?!
you and your friend.
what are you doing?!
pleeeeeease!
okay!  okay, fuck it!  use the basement!  get off me!
we need some towels, lou.  we need replacement light bulbs.
alright, christ!  fucking let me go!
thank you.  thank you, sir...
let go of me!!
there is fight club in delaware city.
i heard.  local 15, monday nights.
local 8 just started in penns grove. and, bob said he was at fight club in newcastle last week.
newcastle?  did you start that one?
i thought you did.
what are we doing?
homework assignment.
what is it?
raymond k. hessel. 1320 se benning, apartment a.  a small, cramped basement apartment.
how did you know?
they give basement apartments letters instead of numbers.  raymond, you are going to die.
is this a picture of mom and dad?
yesssss...
your mom and dad will have to call kindly doctor so-and-so to dig up your dental records, because there will not be much left of your face.
please, god, no...
tyler...
an expired community college student id card.  what did you used to study, raymond k. hessel?
s-s-stuff.
"stuff."  were the mid-terms hard?
i asked you what you studied.
tell him!
biology, mostly.
why?
i... i do not know...
what did you want to be, raymond k. hessel?
animals.
yeah ... animals and s-s-s ---
stuff.  that means you have to get more schooling.
too much school.
would you rather be dead?
no, please, no, god, no!
i feel sick.
imagine how he feels.
hey.
hey.
where did you go, psycho-boy?
i felt like destroying something beautiful.
something on your mind?
no.
why was not i told about "project mayhem?"
what should i have told you?
why was not i involved from the beginning?  you and i started fight club together.
fight club was the beginning.  now it is out of the basements and there is a name for it -- project mayhem.
is this a needlepoint club?  is it about you and me?
you know what i mean.
what do you want?  a statement of purpose... ?
look...
should i e-mail you?  should i put this on your "action item list?"
i want to know --
what do you want to know about project mayhem?
this does not belong to us.  we are not the leaders.  we are not special.
what are you doing?!
we are the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world.  we are all part of the same compost heap...
tyler...
what the hell ... ?!
you choose your level of involvement. i will not make decisions for you.
I am not asking you to.
you are asking questions that do not have answers.  you know just as much about project mayhem as anybody else.
i do not think that is true.
i do not know!  nothing!
if you died right now, how would you feel about your life?
i would feel nothing about my life? is that what you want to hear?!
i want to hear the truth.
fuck my life.  fuck fight club.  fuck you and fuck marla.  I am sick of this.  how is that?
why do you think i blew up your condo?
what?
hitting bottom is not a weekend retreat!  it is not a seminar!  you have to forget everything you know, everything you think you know -- about life, about friendship, about you and me.
you... do not have to... leave.
whatever.
really... i mean it.  have you been going to your groups?
chloe's dead.
when?
do you care?
i do not know.
it was the smart move on her part.
i do not understand.  why does a weak person have to go out and find a strong person... to hang onto?
what do you get out of it?
you hear that?
hear what?
that... sawing and hammering.
have we been talking too long?  must we change the subject?
no.
that day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?
what are you talking about?
nothing.
this conversation...
... is over.
... is over.
what is this?  who did this?
... a person.
guy or girl?
why would you ask if it is a guy or a girl?!
why would you get bent if i asked?
let go of me...  leave me alone.
you are afraid to say.
you are too young.  sorry.
wait a minute...
"too young?"
if the applicant is young, we tell him he is too young.  old, too old. fat, too fat.
"applicant?"
if the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
"training?"  tyler...
that would not interest you.
where is tyler?
the first rule of project --
right, right.
the paper street soap company.
can i come in?
he is not here.
what?
he is not here!  tyler's not here anymore!  he is gone away!
what... ?
the garden.  take him there.  move, people.  let's do this!
get your hands off him!  get off...! what the hell do you think you are doing... ? evidence?!  this is a man... !  you killed him!
he was killed in action.
no!  look at you!  you're... you are running around in ski masks, exploding things...
he was killed serving project mayhem.
it is what he would have wanted, sir.
what he wanted?  look... look at him. look at him!  what does he want?  this is a person.  this is not a cog in your machine...
but, this is project mayhem.
no, no.  this is a man -- this man has a name...
but, in project mayhem, we have no names.
no!  wrong!  this man's name is robert paulson.
robert paulson?
robert paulson is dead.  he is dead, because of you...
his name is robert paulson!
no!
i need to know where tyler is.  can not you help me?
sir, you are disturbing the other patrons with your laudish behavior.
there is no one else here.
I am sorry, i have not the faintest idea what you are talking about.
look at my face.  I am a member.  i just need to know if you have seen tyler durden.
I am not disclosed to bespeak any such information to you, nor would i, even if i had said information you want, at this juncture be able.
you are a moron.
I am afraid i have to insist you leave.
how have you been?
... you know me?
is this a test, sir?
yes... it is a test.
you were in here last thursday night.
what?
you were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. it is tight as a drum.
who do you think i am?
is this part of the test?
you are the one who did this to me. you are mr. durden, sir.  tyler durden.
please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position.
yeah?
marla, it is me.  have we... have we ever had sex?
what kind of stupid question is that?!
because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
is this a trick?
will you just answer me, for christsake?!
you mean, you want to know if i think we were just having sex or making love?
we did make love?
is that what you are calling it?
answer the question!
you fuck me, then snub me.  you love me, you hate me.  you show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole!  is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, tyler?
we have just lost cabin pressure.
what did you say... ?
what is wrong with you?
say my name.
what... ?
say my name!  what is my name!?
tyler durden!  tyler durden, you fucking freak.  what is going on?  I am coming over there...
marla, no, wait...
four in milwaukee.
what is this all about, tyler?
and, we are definitely filling a void in the rural south.
why do people think I am you?
you broke your promise.  you talked to her about me.
why do people think I am tyler durden?
why did you do that?
answer me, tyler.
why do people think anything?
i do not know!  tell me!
people think that you are me, because you and i happen to share the same body.
what... ?
is this really news to you?
what are you talking about... ?
sometimes i control it, and you imagine yourself watching me...
the first rule of fight club is -- you do not talk about fight club.
and, sometimes you control it...
he is not here!  tyler's not here anymore!  he is gone away!
you can see me and hear me, but no one else can...
oh, yeah.  i did not really know my dad...
but, when you fall asleep, i do things without you...
there!  happy?  i asked for one thing from you... one simple promise.  now look what you have done!
this is not possible...
we are going to have to do something about marla...
what... what are you saying?
it is okay.  we okay... a little codependent, sure, but...
no!  this is not true.  we... we were around other people, together, both of us...
you never talked to me in front of anyone else.
wrong, wrong -- what about the car crash... the two guys in the backseat?
what about them?  they are lunatics.
you took me to the house.
the house is rented in your name.
you have jobs.
night jobs -- while you were sleeping.
what about marla?
what about marla?
she's... you... you are fucking her.
um, well... technically, no.
who is this?
maintenance.
listen, something is going to happen, something terrible...
very good, sir.
excuse me?
do not worry about us, sir.  we are solid.
now wait, there is been a mix-up. everything's changed...
you told me you would say that.
abort the plan.
you told me you would say that, too.
did i tell you I would call you a fascist dickhead?!
well, sir, you said you might.
marla...
your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  i thought they were going to break my arm.
I am sorry, i...
the were burning their fingertips with lye.  the stink was unbelievable.
marla... i need to talk to you.  it is going to take a tremendous act of faith on your part for you to hear me out.
here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
i do not want to hear anything you have got to say.
give me a minute, marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
sixty seconds, then I am out of here.
absolutely, you have every right.  i need you to do me a favor.
I have done you enough favors.
because... I am tyler durden.
then, I will have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie.
you got about thirty seconds.
i know that I have been... unwell.  i know it is been like there is two sides to me.
two sides?  you are dr. jeckle and mr. jackass.
i deserve that.  anyway, i've... I have only just realized
what?
i mean, the depth and breadth of our relationship has only recently been illuminated for me.  i know this... i know us has not been such a great thing for you...
whatever.  I will take my food to go...
I am trying to tell you -- and this is where you have to trust me -- but, i think your life might be in real danger.
what?
you have to get out of here.  leave as soon as possible.  go to any rural town, away from any major city...
you are an insane person.
marla...
no, no, shut up!  I have had enough. i tried, tyler... i have tried...
there is a part of you i really like, but i can not do this anymore.  i just can't.  this is killing me...
I am sorry, but i...
what?!  you are sorry?  i do not believe that for a minute.
let go of me!
do this for me, marla.  do this for me, if you never do anything else...
leave me alone!  i do not ever want to see you again!
okay, if that is what it takes, you will never have to see me again.  here... here...
tyler...
I am begging you.  get on the bus. get on the bus.
why are you doing this?
i can not let myself see where you are going.  go wherever it takes you, remember... keep away from major cities...
I am not paying this back.  i consider it "asshole tax."
yes, fine.  just, get on.  stay away a couple of weeks, at least.
you could be standing under 37 stories of steel and concrete with a 150 gallons of nitroglycerin strapped to the support... oh, maybe it could not be...
you... you can not be serious about this.
what a ridiculous thing to say.
i can not let you...
...go through with this? what are you going to do?
I am going to...
...stop me?
I am not going...
...to let this happen!
stop finishing...
...your sentences!  they are our sentences.  get your mind around that.
what are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?  we both use that body.
since when is project mayhem about murder?
the buildings were evacuated thirty minutes ago.  everything's proceeding exactly as planned.
you do not know that.  there could still be people inside.
i would not be doing that.  unless you know which wires, in what order...
if you know, i know.
if I am wrong, we are both dead..
this is not about martyrdom.
I am pulling the green wire.
green?  did you say green?
yes...
do not pull the green wire.  pull anything but the green wire.
fuck you.
I am serious.  that is the wrong one.
I have got everything.  the bombs.  the army.  I have got marla.
bob is dead, tyler.  the police blew a hole in his head.  was that part of your plan?
bob was a grown man.  in any great struggle, there will be casualties. would not that be implicit in the name?  project "mayhem."
fuck your struggle.  i want out.
you want out?
i quit.
not an option, for the most obvious of reasons.  you need to get with the program.  seven minutes.  let's get out of here.
tyler...
what?
defuse the bomb.
ask me nicely.
defuse the bomb, please.
defuse the bomb?
yes.
one minute.
i think this is about where we came in.
this is the beginning.  we are at ground zero.  maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
can not you call it off... ?
it is out of our hands.  this is it.
please...
fifteen seconds now.  can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
what the fuck -- ?
paraffin.
what?
paraffin.  your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  i saw it floating in the bomb.
damn it!  god-damn it...
not exactly according to plan.
do we have to do everything ourselves?!
no...
proceed with remote detonation.
how did you do that?!  you are a fucking figment of my imagination... you are psychogenic fugue state...
fuck that, maybe you are my hallucination.
why... why... why... ?
why what?
why can not i get rid of you?  why can not i just wish you away?
you need me.
no, no, i don't.  i thank you, i really do.  thank you, but i do not need you anymore.
look, i can be selfish, i know that.  I am not blind to my own failings...
noooo, please...
from now on, we will share marla. we have been spending too much time apart...
... no, no, no...
no more running off without you. from here on out, we do it together.
why are you doing this?!
I am doing this for us.
please understand... I have gotten all i can from this, tyler.
if i leave, you will be right back where i found you...
i swear on my life, i won't...
you will.  you know you will.
what are you doing?
what have you left for me?
why do you want to do that? why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?
not my mouth.  our mouth.
why are you going with this, ikea- boy?
it is the only way to get rid of you...
do something for me.
what?
appreciate something.
what?
look at me...
what?
my eyes are open.
what happened... ?
do not ask.
my god, you are shot...
yes.
who did this to you?
i did, i think.  but, I am okay... I am fine...
