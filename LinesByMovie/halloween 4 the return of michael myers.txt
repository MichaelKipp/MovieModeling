purpose of visit?
a patient pickup and transfer to smith's grove.
you're late.
yeah.  should be on the road.
yeah, ha, hell of a night huh?
real charmer.
i'll take you down there.
all right.
yes.
i'm dr. hoffman, medical administrator.
has he been prepped?
ready to go.  who signs for him?
i do.
outside.
check him out.
i'd assumed dr. loomis would be here.  michael myers was his patient.
if loomis read memos he's be here. fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. my hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
watch it.
i can safely say that michael myers is now in your hands.
yeah.  well i guess your happy to see him go.
night doc.
drive carefully.
kido. it's four in the morning.
i can't sleep.
what is this? four nights in a row?  you going for a record here?  the seven year olds insomniacs hall of fame?
do you love me rachel?
oh, serious questions tonight.  of course i love you.
like a sister?
jamie, sometimes it's...
like a real sister?
we're not real sisters jamie, but that doesn't mean i love you any less.
sure it does.
i know you miss your parents, its hasn't been that long.
it's been eleven months.
your mother used to baby-sit me when i was your age.  i bet you didn't know that.
your lucky.  i wish she could do the same for me.
come on jamie, lets go back to bed.  come on sunday.
oh dear god. its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
it's okay..it's okay.
clean one in the laundry room next to your blue slacks.  hello?
honey, this tie has a spot on it, i can't wear this today. i got a 10:30 with chuck.
hang on mrs. pierce.  not that tie, on the other side.  that's not the only thing your eating rachel.
mom, i'm on a diet. you want an oinker for a daughter?
found it.
sorry. do you suppose susan could just bring her crutches? oh, stupid question. tell her i hope  she feels better.  susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
why not?
susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  rachel?
mom, please
you'll have to watch jamie tonight.
not tonight. i've got that date with brady. you know how important that is.
well tonight is very important for your father and me.
can't you find somebody else?
its too late.
what am i supposed to tell brady? sorry, but i've got to baby-sit my foster sister, go and have fun by yourself.
its not exactly the end of the world, for goodness sake
sure it is. i think tonight brady was ready to make a commitment.  but now my future relationship, my engagement, my marriage, my children, your grandchildren, have all been wiped out because i have to baby sit tonight.
i'm sorry i ruined everything. if i wasn't here you could go out.
jamie, i'm sorry. i didn't mean it like that. i can go out with brady tomorrow night. its no big deal.
but you wanted to go out tonight. it's my fault that you can't.
well tonight we're going to do something better. we're going to go trick-or-treating.
i don't want to.
it's halloween. i mean don't you want to get dresses up in a really scary costume and get some candy?
how about this afternoon i pick you up from school and we go get ice cream?
double scoops?
double scoops. now lets get some breakfast.
why wasn't i notified?
about what?
you know damn well about what.  you let them take it out of here.
for christ sakes. spare me the speech. i've listened to it for a decade.  the fact is that michael myers was a federal patient, and a federal prisoner therefore he is subject to federal law.
we're not talking about any ordinary prisoner hoffman! we are talking about evil on two legs.
i can see this is useless.
i don't want to have anyone live through that night again.
i've said this before. i think your the one who needs medical help.
when did this happen?
sometime in the night. they probably lost the road in the storm. come down the embankment. it happens.
an accident?
yes, sir.
why shouldn't i?
how many people in the bus?
four plus myers.
how many bodies did you find?
it's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
loomis, it's over. leave it alone.
i've seen bodies thrown 50-60 feet from a crash site.
look, even if by some miracle michael is conscience, his muscles would be totally useless.  give the troopers a chance to search.
now where are you going?
haddonfield. it's a four hour drive. you can reach me through the local police. if you didn't find him in four hours, i'm sure i will.
you remember lindsay don't you?
hi jamie.
hi.
you ready for some ice cream?
i wanna go trick-or-treating like the other kids.
but i thought you didn't want to go trick-or-treating.
you know rach, discount mart is having a sale on halloween costumes.
no. brady's working there till 6:00 today.
i know! don't you want to talk to him?
i don't want to look pushy.
you won't look pushy.
well i don't want to come on too strong. a guy hates a girl to come on strong. fragile egos and all of that.
you won't come on too strong.
well i don't want to seem desperate or anything.
fact it rach, you are desperate.  your just going to go in and buy a costume for jamie. perfectly legit.
i don't know.
well do i drop you off at the discount mart or the dairy queen?
jamie?
the discount mart. can we get ice cream after?
you bet.
call me.
okay, bye.
rachel! what are you doing here? i thought i was supposed to pick you up?
jamie needs a halloween costume.
you do? okay. go down aisle a. we've got the best costumes in the whole town.
come on rachel.
in a second.
we need to talk.
okay sure. what about?
its about tonight.
what?
my parents baby-sitter canceled.
so?
so i have to watch jamie tonight.
when did you find this out?
this morning.
well you found out this morning? why didn't you tell me before? i mean it's 5 o'clock now rachel...shit
don't get angry.
i'm not angry it's just
can i come over after jamie's asleep?
my parents are going to come home early tonight.
so?
i don't know brady.
okay, i guess. i'll call you later.
jamie, what happened?
it was the nightmare man
what?
he's coming to get me rachel.
thank you.
anything for a fellow pilgrim. sometimes we need help getting where we want to be.  reverend jackson pete sayer of dumon county, please to make your aquanauts.
how far are you going, mr. sayer?
gods country, promise land. where are you heading mr..ah
loomis. haddonfield.
car trouble?
sort of.
your hunting it, ain't ya? yeah, your hunting it all right, just like me.
what are you hunting, mr. sayer?
apocalypse, end of the world, armageddon. its always got a face and a name.
i know that mr. sayer.
oh your a pilgrim all right. i saw it on your face back there in the dust. i saw it clear as breasts and blue suede shoes. would you like a drink?
how do we look?
you guys always look great.
we'll be at the fallbrooks. the number's next to the phone.
i know, and next to that is the police, hospital, fire, and probably national guard.
rachel, can i go get my costume on?
yeah, hurry up.
come on rachel!
coming.
i thought you said you were ready.
i'm ready. i'm ready. okay, let's go.
i am. ben meeker.
oh, sheriff meeker, my name is dr. ...
loomis. folks around here aren't likely to forget your face. at least not cops. so what brings you back here after 10 years?
michael myers has escaped from ridgemont. he's here in haddonfield.
that's impossible. michael myers is an invalid.
he's here, sheriff.
why?
10 years ago he tried to kill laurie strode, and now he wants her daughter.
are you talking about jamie lloyd?
where ever she is, that little girl is in mortal danger.
myers has been locked up since before she was born. he's never laid eyes on her.
six bodies, sheriff! that's what i have seen between here and ridgemont. a filling station in flames. i'm telling you michael myers is here in this town. he's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way.
hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  and assuming what you say is true..
its true, sheriff.
all right, all right. its true, what the hell can we do to avoid a repeat of what happened 10 years ago?
find this little girl, get her somewhere safe. call the local t.v. station. tell them to get people off the streets and behind locked doors.
when he makes that call.
all right. pierce, do it. lets check on this little girl.
jamie, wait for me.
this is great rachel. come on.
had enough?
no way! halloween's great. can we stay out all night?
forget it kido. we're home by eight o'clock.
hi rachel.
hi.
rachel, i've got an expl-- i've got an explanation.
you don't owe me anything.
just leave me alone and lets forget it.
no, you don't understand.
i mean, you blew off our date at last minute.
so you hop on to the next best thing? i thought you were different from other guys.
i am different, it's just that i just got pissed off...that's all.
oh really? well, i'll just let you get back to little ms. hot panties.
not like 'ol ben meeker do something like that.
sure ain't. martians could land on ben's doorstep, all he'd do is spit once and get himself a shot gun.
who you calling?
police station. i ain't closing down with out a good goddamn reason.
we're going to ben's. the phone never just rings at a police station.
no way. no how.
something?
he's been here.
how do you know?
this is starting to spook me.
least i'm not alone.
logan, i want you to stay here in case the family gets back.
right here, ben.
you look sharp. you understand?
no problem, sheriff.
rachel, jamie. thank god!
what's going on?
is that him? is that him?
yes.
oh christ. doc...
dear god.
oh christ. they wouldn't have given up without a fight.
they didn't know what they were fighting.
how can a man do this loomis? tell me.
it isn't a man.
what is he? tell me! what the hell are we dealing with?
evil.
what the hell did this?
looks to me like your out of business. now i want some answers.
it was michael myers. he's come home to kill.
let it be earl. let the police handle it.
like the last time? how many people killed back then? how many kids?
al here lost his boy 10 years back.
you son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
you haven't got a police force! these men may be the only defense you've got.
132 to 133 this is 134.
this is 132, over.
ben-uh-i just heard about the station.
go to my house. we'll call the state force from there.
i'll be there in 5 minutes.
honey, i don't think their home.
how do you know their not?
because the lights are all out.
i told them to be here by nine. its not 9:30 yet.
we should call the fire department.
i'm not calling the fire department.
shit, earl. it's ted holster.
you dumb son of a bitch, you said you saw myers.
where's that deputy?
be here in a minute.
rachel, take your sister upstairs. first door on the right.
dad, what's going on?
kelly, i want you to close and lock all the downstairs windows.
why?
just do it.
where's the radio?
right through the kitchen you'll see the basement stairs.  brady, you know how to use a gun?
you got your riot gun?
yeah in the trunk of my squad.
go get it.
get the outside shutters.
what are we doing?
making sure that no one can get in here.
isn't this all a little paranoid?
if you'd seen that police station you wouldn't even ask.
are you two okay?
we've been better.
what's going on?
michael myers.
who's that?
10 years ago? halloween? he's jamie's uncle.
that's all the windows, dad.
all right. good good.  logan i want you right here by the front door. this is the dead bolt key.
now i pad locked the back door, this is the only way in and out of this house. you got that?
got it ben.
why don't you go make some coffee.
all right.
can we go home soon rachel?
real soon, jamie. now shh.
how's it powered?
batteries. i planned the generator for the house next week. i wished i hadn't waited.  this is squawk 79er zero of haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. can anyone hear me?
hell of a night.
its not over yet.
where are you going?
the corruther's house. that's where jamie lives, that's where he'll go.
leave myers for the state boys.
the state police won't know how to stop him.
do you?
maybe nobody knows how to stop him, but i've got to try.
i didn't know you and brady had anything okay?
you knew. you just didn't care.
he's not married. besides, i've got a right to do what's best for me.
don't you mean what you do best?
wise up to what men want rachel, or brady won't be the last man you lose to another woman.
sheriff, what is going on out there?
all right rachel, you stay by this radio. the state boys will send word once their in route. when that word comes you go tell deputy logan.
okay.
now you understand?
uh huh.
i'll be out on gateway and i doubt i'll be back before the troopers get here.
maybe you ought to wait here till they do.
hey. i got a town full of beer bellies running around in the dark with shotguns. who's gonna be next? somebody's wife? somebody's kid?
no, no, we have to get out of here right now.
not without jamie.
look.
you think she stands a chance?
she's not dead!
is there another key?
i don't know!
its metal, god dammit its metal.
what does that mean?
we're trapped in this house.
jamie!
oh rachel!
brady!
get back!
brady!
no. you son of a bitch!
shit!
brady! come with us.
go!
brady!
get up there rachel!
brady!
get up there rachel!
brady! come with us! brady!
go!
rachel come on.
no.
come on.
i'm gonna lower you to the chimney, okay jamie?
i can't.
well try dammit!
rachel!
i've got you come on, go down.
rachel!
what are you doing out here alone?
everybody's dead. i just wanna go home.
oh no you can't. i've just been there. that's the first place he'll look for you. where's the school house? where is the school house?
we'll hear sirens soon.
then we'll be safe?
yeah.
you don't believe that do you?
no.
okay everybody, listen up. i've got rachel corruthers and her sister in the truck, and i'm taking them outta town route 410. state police are on the way. got that?
got it earl.
okay, out.
sheriff meeker, we killed him.
calm down. calm down. are you all right? are you all right?
jamie! get away!
don't touch him jamie!
it's over.
yes. michael myers is in hell, buried, where he belongs.
these kids aren't likely to forget.
they've survived this ordeal, they'll survive it's memory.
