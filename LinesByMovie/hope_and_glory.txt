i did see them. i did.
he's the worst liar.
is it peace in out time?
no, mother! it's war! war!
or what?
crocodiles! aah!
the sodding water table.
could you seal it over with hot pitch, clive? caulk it like the hull of a ship.
thanks. i hope you can come for the launching.
it's not fair on them. it's selfish to keep them with you.
my aunt in australia has offered..
it's so far way. i couldn't bear it.
kids don't care. you're thinking of yourself.
i didn't mean it like that, grace. why does it always come out wrong?
i know you mean well.
you're the biggest fibber.
it's dinner time. it really is. cross my heart.
i doubt if a few bombs would wake up dawn on a sunday morning.
this phoney war get's on my nerves. if we're going to have a war, i wish they'd get it started.
just ignore her, mac.
...it was a toss-up. his company went to india, mine went to france. flip of a coin.
...two indians to fan me all night. the heat.
....buried in a shell-hole for thee days, while he's out there playing polo and sticking pigs.
it was the best time of his life.
how many of our class left? you and me out of twenty-eight.
and jim.
what's left of him. he'll never see outside of the star and garter.
no turks.
we didn't know that. it was a suicide mission. machetes against artillery. volunteers only.
they'd gone.
we all had to write a last letter home.
and it was the last. hasn't written a letter since. not even a birthday card.
but dad, it's the news.
thanks, son. i can hear it. i'm not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
root it out clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
weeds will grow, mac.
consider grace, the kids. i love them like my own. and you.
kiss me hardy.
you're a mug, clive. we did our bit in the last lot.
if king and country call, mac, you go as soon as i will.
what did we know? we were seventeen.
i heard the drum and fife yesterday, mac, marching past.  made my hair stand on end.  i thought, i've been asleep for twenty years.
he's never going to come back. he's gone off to be a soldier and mummy doesn't even know.
it doesn't matter, i can drive the car home.
you wouldn't.
would.
you couldn't.
could.
has sue got it right?
what's that?
you joined up.
oh, that.
i wish you could have told me yourself.  oh, grace, it's not for long. they say it'll be over by christmas.
now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it's really an off break. got it? like this.
it's like telling fibs.
that's it. when you tell a lie, you hope to get away with it. when someone else does, you want to find them out. a good batsman will spot a googly. a good bowler will hide it. always remember that, son.
i can't do it. what's the point?
it's just the wrench, grace. it's for their sake.
please yourself.  let them go, if they want.
grace!
you know it? it must be an old one.
ancient. have you finished your homework?
after this dance.
he always knows.
half the time he's bluffing.
what would we do if a german came into the house?
don't be silly, dawn.
well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here?
the next one is ours. either it hits us or it goes past us.
...and four and five...
please god. not on us. drop it on mrs. evans. she's a cow.
...and six...
can't we just see the end?
they've got the real thing outside.
it's not the same.
it was great for me, how was it for you.
a bit too quick.
well. now we can do it slow. are those some kind of stockings you're wearing?
they might be.
i mean, no suspenders. they just kinda' disappear up your ass.
mind that shrapnel dawn thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in bill's face.
i'm starting my own collection.
it's canadian. where'd you get it?
tell me the truth. you had to get married, didn't you? because of me.
the ideas you get in your head.
that's why you never liked me. i'm different from you. well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. so there.
pauline's mum got killed.
no, she didn't.
yes, she did, didn't she?
go and ask her if she wants to play.
ask her yourself.
you do it. you're a girl.
it seems to have survived.
play something, grace.
i won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
it's only a joke, mummy. i'm fifteen. i'm still at school. i want to be a nun when i grow up.
tell them about pauline's mum.
not now. they wouldn't believe me.
what are you doing here? this is our territory
looking for shrapnel.
i never was.
yes, you was. make him talk.
i know a secret.
what's that?
the germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
who told you that?
my uncle's in the war office. he said, don't go on the bomb sites. "boys are going missing all the time."
they're not.
you want to join our gang?
i don't mind.
do you know any swear words?
yes.
say them.
well go on then. you can't join if you can't answer.
i only know one.
that word is special. that word is only for something really important. now, repeat after me... bugger off.
bugger off.
sod.
sod.
bloody.
bloody.
now put them together. bugger off, you bloody sod.
bugger off, you bloody sod.
ok. you're in.
they pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the germans land they'll lose their way.
won't they have maps?
they'll have to go to a shop to buy a map, stupid. then they'll give zemselves avay viz ze vay zay tork.
and where do you think you're going?
out.
you go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
no, i won't.
i want him. i want him so much. i'll kill myself if i can't have him.
there, there, my baby.
you better bring him home, if you really love him. don't kill love. you'll regret it for the rest of your life.
who said anything about love?
take it away. i know your husband's been away a long time, but....
don't be so cheeky, bruce.
and what's that?
jam.
we don't know anything about it
well, it's off ration. we know that.
how do we know they didn't plant it there? they know we're mad on jam.  they could poison half the country.
well?
it looks....foreign.
jam is jam! it's just jam!
well, i'm not having any. even if it's not poisoned. i don't think it's right. it's not patriotic.
you don't like jam. you hate jam. you never eat jam.
that's not the point.
taste it. why don't you taste it?
you taste it.
you mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
that's it.
why didn't they say that before you started?
i wasn't too old when i started the course. i was too old when it finished.
what are you going to be then?
a clerk. i'm doing a typing course. i'll be typing for england.
bruce, look! dad got some german jam.
we thought it was poison.
when do you think you'll get leave again?
not till christmas, i don't suppose.
i'm glad you didn't send them to your aunt.
i've had a letter from her. they've moved house.
where to?
what kind of war is this mac?  up there in cumberland, we never see an air-raid. the worst problem i have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. when i rode in against the turks, i knew what it was about.
did you? you thought you did. we've been gypsed, all our lives. look at your street.
what about it?
rosehill avenue. no roses. no hill. and it's certainly not an avenue.
why not?
you need trees for an avenue.
there was talk of planting some when we first came.
propaganda. we've been had.
how's your war, mac?
never done better. on the fiddle. like everyone else.
except the servicemen.
naturally.
i don't understand. is there any point to it?
there is all right. this hitter fellow. we've got to winkle him out. and get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
you always were, clive. steady the buffs.
bugger the buffs.
don't panic!  keep your head!
i will if you will!
god, how i hate all this scrimping and squalor.
i don't mind it. it was harder before the war. trying to keep up appearances. now it's patriotic to be poor.
i don't know how you cope, grace. three kids, army pay. on your own.
you know something, molly? i like it on my own. i never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
molly!
well! i'm not talking about mac. he hasn't toughed me for ages. and not often ever. my life started when mac went on nights.
you're having me on, molly.
am i? maybe i am.
you've been drinking. your tipsy.
tipsy, topsy, turvy.
i suppose they're still learning, that's why they keep moving about.
it's easy. i've done it.
who with?
pauline.
liar. mummy keep still and daddy moves on top of her. that's what they do when they know how.
boy, that was some air-raid.
air-raid?
didn't you feel the house rock? you must have seen all those shell bursts.
mac, that was wonderful. i haven't been to a concert since...
...since i used to take you to the proms?
that's right. not since then not since i got married.
you said that last year, dad.
the land and the king are one, my son. if he stutters we falter. he's getting batter, and so are we.
to mary mcdonald, thelma richardson, bobo hinds, lily sanderson...  ...little sarah whats-it, now there was a spirit. and marjorie anderson.
father, that's enough now
and...and...henry chapman's girl, was it thelma? no, i can see those cornflower eyes...i've lost your name, my sweetness.
what's that?
henry chapman's daughter. it was sheila. i remember her from last year.
so it was. sheila. this boy will go far.
what is it?
we're not supposed to say, but we're being shipped out tomorrow.
where?
i don't know?
you do, you do. you're just not saying.
i swear i don't know.  here's your christmas present.
you expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? and you'll meet some french girl who can speak your own language. no thank you!
please yourself.
what is it, pet?
he's being posted. i was terrible to him.
don't leave it like that. go after him. swallow your pride.
what did he say?
he said i was right. i shouldn't wait for him. i was better to make a clean break.
i think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which i never wanted to do. i told him that.
what's that?
big berthas, shelling france. twenty-five-mile range, they have.
wow!
they send over a few every day, to let them know we're still here. each shell costs as much as a ford 8.
who pays for them?
we will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
remember this beach, mac? all those summers. out two families, together.
happy days.  when you're bigger, bill, i'll teach you the googly.
mac, did you ever find out who molly went off with?
a polish pilot. it's like one of those jokes on the wireless.
she said, 'i know you love me, mac, but you've never loved me enough.'
not loving enough. that is a terrible thing to do to someone. i suppose i did it to clive. always held something back.
it's all better left unsaid, grace.
you were never apart, you and clive. he kept asking and asking.  and i waited and waited for you to say something. and you never did.
clive had a job. i didn't. i couldn't.
he could always make me laugh.
we did the decent thing.
this war's put an end to decent things. i want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
we can't change what's past. not even the war can do that.
we did all the proper things, and we lost love. that's sad, mac.
i don't believe this is happening to me.
it's not. it's happening to me.
what did i do to deserve this?
you married that fool, clive, that's what. never mind, you can stay with us.
how long?
bless you, mac. what would i have done without you?
you might still have a house.
i wish it could all have been different.
look after yourself, grace.
can i try?
put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.
did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, grace?
up to six weeks, i think.
how are we going to cope?
never let a rat creep up on you.
i think you hit him, grandpa. he was limping when he ran off.
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. all the punts lit up with chinese lanterns. like fireflies. and the gramophone going on one of the boats. always the charleston, the charleston, the charleston. oh, you girls.
wasn't it lovely?
that was a googly!
i know.
you're a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. toss me up another.
no, you're out, grandpa. it's my turn.
want to know why they're called faith, hope, grace and charity?
why?
your grandmother. she named them after virtues i lack. that's marriage for you.
this is going too far, young man.
but grandpa, you said...
i concede i was insistent, but how the devil...
it looks a bit fishy to me.
could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
i'm so glad you could come. here we are, all together again.
happy as can be. in the old groove.
so you're going to be a grandfather.
and i'm still just a lad myself.
don't bother to grow up. it's no fun at all.
what can you do with four daughters, i asked myself, a string quartet was all i could come up with. they hated me for making them learn.
and now we're glad you did.
here's to music. and absent friends.
and absent bridegrooms!
and the bride.
i've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, clive. i never want to leave the river again. the children have had such a wonderful summer.
fair enough.  the river.
give him the you-know-what.
very well, grandpa.
now take deep breaths, and push.
why? it's coming on its own. it doesn't hurt.
you did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
well, for the baby, really.
thank you billy, from the baby and me.
you miserable little tripe-hound. i'm the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
i have to live in rosehill avenue as well.
only till they get you into the local school.
with mrs. evans. i hate her.
you'll be at home for the weekends. now shut up, or walk.
it's true.
you're much more convincing when you're making it up.
grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
apparently so.
