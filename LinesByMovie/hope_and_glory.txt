i did see them. i did.
he is the worst liar.
is it peace in out time?
no, mother! it is war! war!
or what?
crocodiles! aah!
the sodding water table.
could you seal it over with hot pitch, clive? caulk it like the hull of a ship.
thanks. i hope you can come for the launching.
it is not fair on them. it is selfish to keep them with you.
my aunt in australia has offered..
it is so far way. i could not bear it.
kids do not care. you are thinking of yourself.
i did not mean it like that, grace. why does it always come out wrong?
i know you mean well.
you are the biggest fibber.
it is dinner time. it really is. cross my heart.
i doubt if a few bombs would wake up dawn on a sunday morning.
this phoney war get's on my nerves. if we are going to have a war, i wish they would get it started.
just ignore her, mac.
...it was a toss-up. his company went to india, mine went to france. flip of a coin.
...two indians to fan me all night. the heat.
....buried in a shell-hole for thee days, while he is out there playing polo and sticking pigs.
it was the best time of his life.
how many of our class left? you and me out of twenty-eight.
and jim.
what is left of him. he will never see outside of the star and garter.
no turks.
we did not know that. it was a suicide mission. machetes against artillery. volunteers only.
they would gone.
we all had to write a last letter home.
and it was the last. has not written a letter since. not even a birthday card.
but dad, it is the news.
thanks, son. i can hear it. I am not sleeping, just closing my eyes.
root it out clive... the thought of it, before it takes hold.
weeds will grow, mac.
consider grace, the kids. i love them like my own. and you.
kiss me hardy.
you are a mug, clive. we did our bit in the last lot.
if king and country call, mac, you go as soon as i will.
what did we know? we were seventeen.
i heard the drum and fife yesterday, mac, marching past.  made my hair stand on end.  i thought, I have been asleep for twenty years.
he is never going to come back. he is gone off to be a soldier and mummy does not even know.
it does not matter, i can drive the car home.
you wouldn't.
would.
you couldn't.
could.
has sue got it right?
what is that?
you joined up.
oh, that.
i wish you could have told me yourself.  oh, grace, it is not for long. they say it will be over by christmas.
now, the googly looks like a leg break, but it is really an off break. got it? like this.
it is like telling fibs.
that is it. when you tell a lie, you hope to get away with it. when someone else does, you want to find them out. a good batsman will spot a googly. a good bowler will hide it. always remember that, son.
i can not do it. what is the point?
it is just the wrench, grace. it is for their sake.
please yourself.  let them go, if they want.
grace!
you know it? it must be an old one.
ancient. have you finished your homework?
after this dance.
he always knows.
half the time he is bluffing.
what would we do if a german came into the house?
do not be silly, dawn.
well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here?
the next one is ours. either it hits us or it goes past us.
...and four and five...
please god. not on us. drop it on mrs. evans. she is a cow.
...and six...
can not we just see the end?
they have got the real thing outside.
it is not the same.
it was great for me, how was it for you.
a bit too quick.
well. now we can do it slow. are those some kind of stockings you are wearing?
they might be.
i mean, no suspenders. they just kinda' disappear up your ass.
mind that shrapnel dawn thrusts a brass regimental hat badge in bill's face.
I am starting my own collection.
it is canadian. where did you get it?
tell me the truth. you had to get married, did not you? because of me.
the ideas you get in your head.
that is why you never liked me. I am different from you. well, everything's different now, so it does not matter. so there.
pauline's mum got killed.
no, she didn't.
yes, she did, did not she?
go and ask her if she wants to play.
ask her yourself.
you do it. you are a girl.
it seems to have survived.
play something, grace.
i will not have this vulgar talk in my house.
it is only a joke, mummy. I am fifteen. I am still at school. i want to be a nun when i grow up.
tell them about pauline's mum.
not now. they would not believe me.
what are you doing here? this is our territory
looking for shrapnel.
i never was.
yes, you was. make him talk.
i know a secret.
what is that?
the germans are dropping men on bomb sites.
who told you that?
my uncle's in the war office. he said, do not go on the bomb sites. "boys are going missing all the time."
they are not.
you want to join our gang?
i do not mind.
do you know any swear words?
yes.
say them.
well go on then. you can not join if you can not answer.
i only know one.
that word is special. that word is only for something really important. now, repeat after me... bugger off.
bugger off.
sod.
sod.
bloody.
bloody.
now put them together. bugger off, you bloody sod.
bugger off, you bloody sod.
ok. you are in.
they pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the germans land they will lose their way.
will not they have maps?
they will have to go to a shop to buy a map, stupid. then they will give zemselves avay viz ze vay zay tork.
and where do you think you are going?
out.
you go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
no, i won't.
i want him. i want him so much. I will kill myself if i can not have him.
there, there, my baby.
you better bring him home, if you really love him. do not kill love. you will regret it for the rest of your life.
who said anything about love?
take it away. i know your husband's been away a long time, but....
do not be so cheeky, bruce.
and what is that?
jam.
we do not know anything about it
well, it is off ration. we know that.
how do we know they did not plant it there? they know we are mad on jam.  they could poison half the country.
well?
it looks....foreign.
jam is jam! it is just jam!
well, I am not having any. even if it is not poisoned. i do not think it is right. it is not patriotic.
you do not like jam. you hate jam. you never eat jam.
that is not the point.
taste it. why do not you taste it?
you taste it.
you mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
that is it.
why did not they say that before you started?
i was not too old when i started the course. i was too old when it finished.
what are you going to be then?
a clerk. I am doing a typing course. I will be typing for england.
bruce, look! dad got some german jam.
we thought it was poison.
when do you think you will get leave again?
not till christmas, i do not suppose.
I am glad you did not send them to your aunt.
I have had a letter from her. they have moved house.
where to?
what kind of war is this mac?  up there in cumberland, we never see an air-raid. the worst problem i have is getting a new typewriter ribbon. when i rode in against the turks, i knew what it was about.
did you? you thought you did. we have been gypsed, all our lives. look at your street.
what about it?
rosehill avenue. no roses. no hill. and it is certainly not an avenue.
why not?
you need trees for an avenue.
there was talk of planting some when we first came.
propaganda. we have been had.
how is your war, mac?
never done better. on the fiddle. like everyone else.
except the servicemen.
naturally.
i do not understand. is there any point to it?
there is all right. this hitter fellow. we have got to winkle him out. and get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
you always were, clive. steady the buffs.
bugger the buffs.
do not panic!  keep your head!
i will if you will!
god, how i hate all this scrimping and squalor.
i do not mind it. it was harder before the war. trying to keep up appearances. now it is patriotic to be poor.
i do not know how you cope, grace. three kids, army pay. on your own.
you know something, molly? i like it on my own. i never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
molly!
well! I am not talking about mac. he has not toughed me for ages. and not often ever. my life started when mac went on nights.
you are having me on, molly.
am i? maybe i am.
you have been drinking. your tipsy.
tipsy, topsy, turvy.
i suppose they are still learning, that is why they keep moving about.
it is easy. I have done it.
who with?
pauline.
liar. mummy keep still and daddy moves on top of her. that is what they do when they know how.
boy, that was some air-raid.
air-raid?
did not you feel the house rock? you must have seen all those shell bursts.
mac, that was wonderful. i have not been to a concert since...
...since i used to take you to the proms?
that is right. not since then not since i got married.
you said that last year, dad.
the land and the king are one, my son. if he stutters we falter. he is getting batter, and so are we.
to mary mcdonald, thelma richardson, bobo hinds, lily sanderson...  ...little sarah whats-it, now there was a spirit. and marjorie anderson.
father, that is enough now
and...and...henry chapman's girl, was it thelma? no, i can see those cornflower eyes...i've lost your name, my sweetness.
what is that?
henry chapman's daughter. it was sheila. i remember her from last year.
so it was. sheila. this boy will go far.
what is it?
we are not supposed to say, but we are being shipped out tomorrow.
where?
i do not know?
you do, you do. you are just not saying.
i swear i do not know.  here's your christmas present.
you expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? and you will meet some french girl who can speak your own language. no thank you!
please yourself.
what is it, pet?
he is being posted. i was terrible to him.
do not leave it like that. go after him. swallow your pride.
what did he say?
he said i was right. i should not wait for him. i was better to make a clean break.
i think it is very sensible in the circumstances.
now he is gone and made me fall in love with him, which i never wanted to do. i told him that.
what is that?
big berthas, shelling france. twenty-five-mile range, they have.
wow!
they send over a few every day, to let them know we are still here. each shell costs as much as a ford 8.
who pays for them?
we will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
remember this beach, mac? all those summers. out two families, together.
happy days.  when you are bigger, bill, I will teach you the googly.
mac, did you ever find out who molly went off with?
a polish pilot. it is like one of those jokes on the wireless.
she said, 'i know you love me, mac, but you have never loved me enough.'
not loving enough. that is a terrible thing to do to someone. i suppose i did it to clive. always held something back.
it is all better left unsaid, grace.
you were never apart, you and clive. he kept asking and asking.  and i waited and waited for you to say something. and you never did.
clive had a job. i didn't. i couldn't.
he could always make me laugh.
we did the decent thing.
this war's put an end to decent things. i want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
we can not change what is past. not even the war can do that.
we did all the proper things, and we lost love. that is sad, mac.
i do not believe this is happening to me.
it is not. it is happening to me.
what did i do to deserve this?
you married that fool, clive, that is what. never mind, you can stay with us.
how long?
bless you, mac. what would i have done without you?
you might still have a house.
i wish it could all have been different.
look after yourself, grace.
can i try?
put your hand on mine, get the knack of it.
did they say how long it would take to get new ration books, grace?
up to six weeks, i think.
how are we going to cope?
never let a rat creep up on you.
i think you hit him, grandpa. he was limping when he ran off.
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. all the punts lit up with chinese lanterns. like fireflies. and the gramophone going on one of the boats. always the charleston, the charleston, the charleston. oh, you girls.
was not it lovely?
that was a googly!
i know.
you are a dark horse, bowling googlies at your age. toss me up another.
no, you are out, grandpa. it is my turn.
want to know why they are called faith, hope, grace and charity?
why?
your grandmother. she named them after virtues i lack. that is marriage for you.
this is going too far, young man.
but grandpa, you said...
i concede i was insistent, but how the devil...
it looks a bit fishy to me.
could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
I am so glad you could come. here we are, all together again.
happy as can be. in the old groove.
so you are going to be a grandfather.
and I am still just a lad myself.
do not bother to grow up. it is no fun at all.
what can you do with four daughters, i asked myself, a string quartet was all i could come up with. they hated me for making them learn.
and now we are glad you did.
here's to music. and absent friends.
and absent bridegrooms!
and the bride.
I have found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, clive. i never want to leave the river again. the children have had such a wonderful summer.
fair enough.  the river.
give him the you-know-what.
very well, grandpa.
now take deep breaths, and push.
why? it is coming on its own. it does not hurt.
you did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
well, for the baby, really.
thank you billy, from the baby and me.
you miserable little tripe-hound. I am the one who should be fed up, sacrificing my last sup of black market petrol to take you to school.
i have to live in rosehill avenue as well.
only till they get you into the local school.
with mrs. evans. i hate her.
you will be at home for the weekends. now shut up, or walk.
it is true.
you are much more convincing when you are making it up.
grandpa, if you think of something hard enough, can you make it happen?
apparently so.
