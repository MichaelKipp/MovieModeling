you we telling me about the ring of fire.
yeah, well, i may be getting in over my head here, i mean you are the geologist, but my theory for what it is worth, you got all these volcanoes and each time one pops it is the equivalent of what, twenty, thirty megatons of tnt?  enough to light las vegas for how long?  how many years? course, I am no mathematician but--
yeah, i know. pour 'em short.
has ray come in yet?
no, he is off tonight. where was he last night?

listen, i got tickets for the oilers and the rams next week in the astrodome. ever sat on the fifty yard line?
i do not follow baseball.
you will not have to. I will explain what a palate is.
you will not have to. i just wanted to see if you knew.
what is this?
you said the usual--
red label.
right. sorry.
pour that back.
what.
do not throw that out.
right.
so how long have you know meurice?
about ten years.
deuce in the corner needs help.
right.
...so what are you doing tonight?
going out with meurice.
it will pass.
we do not seem to be communicating--
you want to hustle me. i do not want to be hustled. it is as simple as that. now that I have communicated, why do not you leave?
i own the place.
christ, I am getting bored.
I am not surprised, the company you have been keeping the last ten years.
what is this?
what.
this.
jack daniels. do not worry, I am paying for it.
that is not the point.
what is the point?
the point is we do not serve niggers here.
where?  ...i'm very careful about that.
why d'you wanna leave all this?
you kidding? i do not wanna leave all this, i just wanna leave marty...
...drive me to a motel?
you can stay at my place, I will drop you there.
where... where you going?
see a guy.
do not go to the bar, ray. i know him, that am not a good idea.
i just gotta see a guy.
howdy stranger.
meurice. sorry i did not show last night.
was not too busy. you missed a good one, though. this white guy walks in about one o'clock, asks if we have a discount for alcoholics... i tell him to get lost, but marty's sitting here listening and i can tell he is thinking that maybe it am not such a bad idea...
is marty here?
not here tonight. was not here last night. he is especially not back in his office.
thanks meurice.
for what?
what "what"?
am i fired? you wanna hit me? what?
i do not particularly want to talk to you.
well... if you are not going to fire me i might as well quit.
fine. suit yourself.  ...having a good time?
then what did you come here for?
you owe me for two weeks.
...you get a refund though, if you tell me who else she is been sluicing.
i want that money. if you wanna tell me something, fine--
what are you, a fucking marriage counselor?
...i thought you were dead. going home?
no. i think I will stay right here in hell.
kind of a bleak point of view there, is not it marty?
meurice...
...i do not want that asshole near my money. i do not even want him in the bar.
we get a lot of assholes in here, marty.
who was it?
what?
on the phone. was it for you?
i do not know, he did not say anything.
uh-huh. so how do you know it was a he?
you got a girl--am i screwing something up by being here?
...i can find a place tomorrow, then I will be outta your hair.
if that is what you want to do, then you oughta do it. you, uh... you want the bed or the couch?
well... the couch would be all right...
you can sleep on the bed if you want.
well... I am not going to put you out of your bed...
you would not be putting me out.
...well, I would be okay in here--
...that's the test, am not it? test of true love--
got a job for you.
...well, if the pay's right and it is legal I will do it.
it is not strictly legal.
if the pay's right I will do it.
it's, uh... it is in reference to that gentleman and my wife. the more i think about it the more irritated i get.
yeah? well how irritated are you?
...gee, I am sorry to hear that. can you tell me what you want me to do or is it a secret?
listen, I am not--this is not a joke here.
you want me to kill 'em.
i did not say that.  well?
well what?
what do you think?
you are an idiot.
so, uh... this would not interest you.
i did not say that. all i said was you are an idiot. hell, you been thinking about it so much it is driving you simple.
I am supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. i mean real stupid. now why should i trust you?
for the money.
the money. yeah. that is a right smart of money...
...there's a big--
i want you to go fishing.
...what?
go down to corpus for a few days. get yourself noticed. I will give you a call when it is done... you just find a way to cover that money.
listen meurice, you are going to help me with a problem.
i am?
you are going to keep an eye on marty and ray, make sure nothing happens.
it won't?
thanks, meurice.
any time. but you do not have to worry about a thing for a while. marty went down to corpus yesterday.
i could have sworn i heard something.
door's locked. nothing there.
i knew it. 'cause we would not have heard anything if it was him. he is real careful. fact is, he is anal.
...huh?
yeah, he told me once himself. he said to me...
...well I will be damned.
i could not believe it either...
...he sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
yeah? what happened?
psychiatrist said i was the healthiest person he would ever met, so marty fired him.
...i do not know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
well, i did not see him anymore, I will tell you that much.
uh-huh.
i said, marty, how come you are anal and i got to go to the psychiatrist?
what did he say?
nothing. he is like you, he does not say much.
thanks.
except when he does not say things they are usually nasty.
...mm-hmm.
when you do not they are usually nice.
...you ever get tired?
huh? oh, yeah, i guess. mm-hmm.
yeah. is it...
ya catch any fish?
...what?
ya catch any fish?
yeah...
...what kind of fish?
listen, what is it? is it done?
just the ten thousand'll be fine.
got something to show me first?
dead, huh?
so it would seem.
...what did you do with the bodies?
it is taken care of. the less you know about it the better.
jesus, i do not believe it...
something i got to ask you, marty. I have been very very careful. have you been very very careful?
of course.
nobody knows you hired me?
...i just made a call about that. it will look fine.
i must have gone money simple. this kind of murder...
...it's too damn risky.
then you should not have done it. can not have it both ways.
...count it if you want.
nah, i trust ya.
what day is it today, angie?
tuesday.
tuesday is ladies' night.
what?
tuesday night is ladies' night. all your drinks are free.
hello?
abby... you all right?
ray?... what time is it?
i do not know. it is early... i love you.
...you all right?
i do not know. i better get off now.
okay, see ya... thanks, ray.
abby--
...ray?
you are bad.
...what?
i said you are bad.
why did not you get into bed?
i did not think i could sleep. I am surprised you could. are you all right?
yeah...
...you called me this morning.
yeah.
...i just wanted to let you know that everything was all right. i took care of everything. now all we have to do is keep our heads.
...what do you mean?
what happened?--was meurice there?
yeah.
well... what happened?
i cleaned it all up, but that am not important...
...anyway, we got some time now. but we gotta be smart.
ray--
abby, never point a gun at anyone unless you are going to shoot him. and when you shoot him you better make sure he is dead...
...that's the only thing they told us in the service that was worth a goddamn--where the hell's my windbreaker?
what the hell happened, ray?
...that's what is important.
i do not know what you are talking about.
i... i mean what are you talking about, ray? i have not done anything funny.
...what was that?
...who?
marty.
...what's going on with you two?
all right...
got a problem, meurice?
no, you do, cowboy. you been to the bar?
...why?
you should not have taken the money...
...and abby. maybe. but as far as I am concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.
what is that?
...where is everything?
in the trunk.
...you leaving?
is not that what you want?
...but first i gotta know what happened.
what do you want to know?
you broke into the bar. you wanted to get your money. you and marty had a fight. something happened...
...i do not know, was not it you? maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--
with your gun?...
abby. what is the matter?
i... I am sorry, meurice. i got to talk to you... can i come in?
jesus, i got a hangover. want a drink?
no, i--
well i do...
...for you i answer the door. if you wanna stay here, that is fine. but I am retired.
something happened with marty and ray--
abby...
...ray stole a shitload of money from marty. until both of 'em calm down I am not getting involved.
no meurice, it is worse than that. something really happened, i think marty's dead--
what?! did ray tell you that?
sort of...
...i mean, i do not know where he is, but he am not dead.
meurice--
you do not look too good. you sleep last night?
...so?
i think someone is watching.
he needs a room, dusty.
i reckon i can hear him...  ...room rate's eight sixty-six a day plus sales tax, plus extra for the tv option.
i reckon i can hear him. tv option, that is a dollar twenty, makes nine eighty-six plus tax.
tell him the channels, dusty.
channels, we got two and six. two do not come in so hot.
sure don't.
see, wednesday's the special on rc cola. i do not know if i explained about the tv option. if there is a tv in the room, you got to pay the option.
and how many room got tv, dusty?
ever durned one.
