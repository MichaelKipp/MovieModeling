test the product?
yeah.
sounds like you do not trust me.
business is business.  now where the hell is it?  i wanna get out of here.  that is the plan, we are just flunkies, you know what I am saying?
you did not answer my question. are you saying my word is of no value to you?
you said that, i didn't.
i have a better plan.  you want to hear it?
what?
i have a better plan.
and what is that?
how about you give us what you have and leave.
what?
am i speaking english here?  how-about-you-give-us-what-you- have-and-leave?
what is this?  do not be stupid man...
first you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
i have to go to the bank before it closes.
what for?
i got to take some money out, that is what for.
there is an atm on speedwell avenue.
yeah but i need to take out four hundred dollars and the atm will only give me three.
well, not that i would not sugar bun but earl's in a bind.  they are going to take his car.
he is irresponsible.
ah hell, he would do the same for me.
has he?
no.  but he would, probably.
get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
i might have to look into that...
just goes to show you.
i mean at least pick a more discreet place, the scalp, under the armpit, under the tongue, someplace where the trained eye wont immediately look.
damn its hot in here...
he probably figured she was on her way out anyhow, no drugs in her system, no foul play.
very clumsy, very clumsy.  id have found it in a minute.
all right youre the super sleuth, what do you want, a medal?
no.  but what i would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and im a busy man.
dammit youre persistent.  i dont want to listen to this anymore.  no more bets with you.
aw, now thats gonna take time to clear!
take it or leave it.
do you even have a girlfriend, jesse?
sort of.
sort of!
hey dwayne why do not you introduce him to your funeral parlor cousin?
she is not his type.
yeah.  that is all i need, to become one of your in-laws.
all right, deputies, take care, do not let your meat loaf.
do not worry the real men are in charge now.
speaking of which that reminds me i have to bring something home or eat sally's meatloaf again, and i do not think i could stand that.
ready to roll, partner?
sure thing, and --
do not spend it all in one place.
i knew you would come through. jesse observes the transaction booth and earl start to leave.
how old is otis anyhow, thirty?
the horniest dog in nevada.
thanks for the loan, man.  I will have it in a few days, i promise.
well i hope so.  that pretty much cleaned me out.
i would have asked my sister, but its better to leave family out, always leads to trouble.
i hear you.
yeah...i remember my brother-in-law gary, the wheel watcher.  he finally got on the show and won seven thousand dollars!  plus some leather furniture. do you think i saw any of that?  his excuse was the government got it all.
seven thousand...
he would have won more but he blew it at the end.  did not know what cash and carry was.
cash and what?
cash and carry, you know, fdr, world war two...
never heard of it.
oh, you would have done great.
i probably would have.  i guess the clues damn near before everyone.
that is what everyone thinks.  but according to him, when it is the real thing, it is quite an intimidatin' environment in which to concentrate.
what the hell...
they are out of towners... arizona plates...
ten thousand right here.
there must be over a million dollars in here.
shit, more than that.
what are we going to do?
what do you mean what are we going to do?
i mean -- earl grabs booth's arm --
call it in i guess.  why?
why?  are you kidding me?
no.  we can't.
look around you partner!  you said yourself you never saw anything like it.
we do not know whose money it is!  they might have robbed a bank, who knows?
robbed a bank, c'mon!  do not you think we would have heard if one, two --  shit i do not know how many were at large!  do not you think there would be a bulletin?  this is a big ass drug deal!
we do not know that.
come on booth!  look at these scumbags around us.  who is going to know what happened!  let's take it and get out of here!
well someone is going to find them.
hell, it will not be us!
it will not work.
why?
i told trudy we were coming down this way, that is why!
we will figure something out.
we would never have to worry about money -- ever again, jesus!
suppose someone knows about the money?  they are bound to ask questions.
who is going to question us? dwayne?  jesse?
it is going to go bigger than that. could you stare someone straight in the face and lie about it?
I will worry about that when it happens and if it happens, and it is not going to happen!
what makes you so sure?
because...i know.
it is no accident we stumbled on this money.  it is an answer to a prayer!  every night and every day I have prayed that god would just -- help me out a little, give me a little push.  tonight my prayer came true.
oh so god's like western union and he just dropped us a couple million bucks?
that is right!
at the expense of six people.
they killed themselves.  besides, they were breaking the law.  what they were doing was wrong!  whatsamatter booth, do not you believe in miracles?
all right hold on!  lemme think...  shit, did you touch the car?
maybe.  who cares?
i do.  it is little shit like that sends people to jail! we have to cover all the bases if we are going to pull this!
all right we will.
we will torch the bases, how is that?
torch it?!
we will leave a few packets in the trunk, and stash the rest somewhere else.  car went up in the gunfight.
i do not know.
I have got one condition.
what is that?
we are going to be patient. if we start flashing money around, buying fancy cars and fancy clothes, people are going to ask questions.
well, we will not do any of that shit!
shhh!
what are you gonna do?
well, i do not know.  I am putting it out of my mind and you should too --
i do not know!  son of a bitch! who the hell are you?
he saw everything!
how long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? answer me!
he will tell them everything to save his ass. that is how they all work it!
I am not letting some gangbanger send me to jail.  we can not risk it.
what are you thinking?
i do not know...
you are thinking about killing him.  i can not do that.  no way.  I have never killed a man.  never even shot at one...
well neither have i, but it is us or him.  if he talks, or writes a note, or whatever, he is going to turn us in.  besides, he is a low life scumbag.  his kind is hardly even human anyway.
i...i can not do that.
okay then.  I will do it.
that is not what i mean.
listen. do you want to go to jail? taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  you know what they would do.
what the hell happened here?
looks like some kind of drug deal or something, they are not from around here --  one of them's still alive.
I would like to know what they were doing in my town!  did you get id off any of them?
none of them had any --
damn.
i want to get some hounds down here.
why?
cause we got footprints leading into that brush, i want to see where it leads...  jesus, seven dead.  I will tell you I have never seen carnage like this in all my seventeen years of sheriffing these parts.  i do not like it.  not in my jurisdiction.
i tell you it was a miracle the way things turned out --
i do not want to hear about miracles and god and all that!  we tried to murder someone to cover our asses!
well we did not kill him, he died on his own.
look.  dwayne was right.  this is going to be a big story.  so big in fact that i do not want to even have this money around.
fair enough, I will take it to my place.
forget it.  we are going to bury it, and we are not going to even think about it until everything dies down.  and no one, i mean no one hears a word about it.	 understand?
hi.
hi.
heard you had quite a night.
yeah.
it was all over the local news. dwayne was there, acting all official.
i know.
what is wrong?
nothing.
nothing's wrong.
oh.  you coming by tonight?
ok.
are you sure you are ok?
yeah I am fine.
I am just tired is all.  I will see you tonight ok baby?
ok.  i love you.
i love you too.
how are ya?
hello.
i guess we can get started.
i wanted to ask you some questions about last night.
thank you.  now, do you remember seeing any vehicles traveling near the site, on your way to or from?
no.  why?
because someone may have gotten away.
what makes you say that?
we had hounds down at the scene, the footprint trail was a bust. and there were no other tire tracks in the vicinity.
could it have been in the mercedes?
maybe.  that is where it was during denning's last report.
normally we would have tracked him with a wiretap, but it was standard for him to occasionally drop out when working with these guys. the last we heard from him was two days ago.
you mean that guy was an agent?
yes.  wife and a kid.  do not blame yourself, deputy.  you did all you could.  you have our deepest gratitude...and my personal thanks.
well, we have one lead and that is what I am looking into next.
what is that?
denning was wearing a bug.
he kept a recording of all such transactions in order to keep track of who is who, what was said, what is happening.  i contacted your local coroner, and he found it taped to his back.
that is news to me.  so it is over at jesse's office?
yeah.  i told him I would be there before five.
excellent. I will go down with you.
we are dead.  we are dead, we are dead...  what are we going to do?!
i do not know...
this is not a joke. what are we going to do!
i do not know you want me to put on my cape and fly there?!  we are going to play it cool... besides there might be nothing on that tape anyway...
that guy was a federal agent. an officer of the law, just like us.
well, we did not know that at the time.
we assaulted a federal agent.  we killed him.
no we didn't.  he died on his own.
oh, right, with a little help from his pals booth and earl.  I am sure that is going to fly real far when they hear that tape...
we gotta turn ourselves in, before they hear the tape.
are you nuts?  they will fry us for sure.  there is no way we are doin' that, you understand?  no way.
it is the right thing to do.
it is the stupid thing to do, that is what it is.
i should have known something like this was going to happen!
man take it easy!  you are sweating like crazy!
i do not know.
this just might be our ticket!
well nothing audible to us.  maybe the lab can pick something up.
damn! martin I am sorry to have dragged you all the way down here for that.  i thought maybe it would help. booth lets out an inaudible deep breath -- earl immediately plays up to martin, clearly relieved --
well we would like to help you in any way we can.  we are all in this together, as law enforcement officers.
we appreciate that.
sally?  i was beginning to think he was not going to leave.
I am in here.
you got me something?  what is the occasion?
you deserve it is the occasion.
what happened to your cheek? sally oh i...nothing...
nothing happened?
dwayne got a little tipsy is all. he does not handle pressure well.  it is over.
like hell it is over.  you told me he was not doing this anymore.
he is not, he's...
that son of a bitch.
booth.  don't.  it is nothing. it is not worth it.  remember what happened the last time?
let's not get into this again. i know him.  if you said something, he would take it out on me.
and I would take it out on him.
and I would end up a widow in two ways.  let's forget it.  I will just be a little more careful next time.
there is not going to be a next time. we are going to get out of here.
you are worth every last penny.
well, i can not let you down now, can i?
how long you been lying there playing possum with us, huh? answer me!
he will tell them everything to save his ass. that is how they all work it!
shit!  we are going to have to get rid of him.  I am not letting some gangbanger ruin my life.  we can not risk it.
what are you thinking?
i do not know...
you are thinking about killing him. i can not do that.  no way.  I have never killed a man.  never even shot at one.
well neither have i, but it is us or him.  if he talks, or writes a note	or whatever, he is going to turn us in.  besides, he is just a low life scumbag.  his kind is hardly even human anyway.
i can not do that.
okay then.  I will do it.
that is not what i mean.
listen.  do you want to go to jail? taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  you know what they would do.
he would have done it to us, right?
exactly.  this is our little secret, partner.
you want to hear the good news first, or the bad news?
give me the bad news.
we retrieved a few things from the trunk, including a steamer trunk, or the remnants of a trunk, the brass clips and so forth.
anything in it?
money.
but nowhere near three million dollars worth.  i would say maybe twenty thousand.
there was more than that.
not in the trunk.
that does not tell us much. did you run a check on the gas like i told you?
yeah, we did.  it was unleaded, high octane.
so...what's the good news?
that fire was set.  deliberately. and probably not by anyone found at the scene.
so someone did get away.
i do not know how else you would explain it.  the coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course denning started it, and that does not make much sense.
no, it doesn't.  neither does his blank tape.  any news on that?
we are doing a check on the manufacturers'	serial number, see if there were other defective tapes in the bunch.  what is your take on these local boys?  are they providing any answers?
you gentlemen look like you are about to toss your collective cookies.
why do not you get to the point.
my point, well...
hey we are all friends, right? friends do not squeal on friends, that is not what jesse segundo is all about.
then what the hell are you all about?
listen earl.  i covered for you. for both of you.  i put my ass on the line to save yours, so do not pull a hostile tone with me!
what is your offer, jesse?
my offer?  well I would say it is a fair one, like i said we are friends.  all i want is my share, which i guess is...
I will settle for a third of that.
and if we refuse?  your tampering with evidence is not exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
true, but neither is attempted murder. in fact I would say that is considerably worse, would not you, earl?
besides, I am not stupid, earl. the tape was a basic maxell d-80.  you can buy 'em at any store.  there is no way they can pin anything on me.
all right, jesse, we will play it your way, under one condition.
I am all ears.
we are going to wait.  all of us, until everything dies down.
well, i do not know...
that is the deal.  if you do not like it, forget it, no one wins.
ok...i'll wait.  for now. but I am going to need a little advance, to oil the wheels, so to speak.
how much?
i understand your logic, booth, but i do not think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
two thousand...
by friday.
what is this?
i do not know...
hey where is the hot pad?
what?
where is the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
i can not hear a word you are saying!
forget it.
it was going to be a surprise!
a surprise huh?  well i do not like any surprises, especially if I am forking over the loot for them!
what are you saying?
I am saying you are about as romantic as a bag of sand.
watch that.  watch that tone.
i could kill that no good son of a bitch!
all right enough!  I am tired of thinking about all this!
well I am not!  thinks he is got us by the balls.
well does not he?  besides if the dea heard that tape we would be behind bars right now.  just call it the cost of doing business.  this whole thing is screwed up.  I am thinking.  maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
...or get rid of the money.  i do not know.
I have got a better idea.  all we have to do is straighten out jesse.
and how do you figure we do that?
all we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  we will set him up somehow.
he is probably made copies.  he is not going to give them up to us.
forget the copies!  he could have made up the copies -- the only thing that incriminates us is the original.
he is going to be trouble.
he is a partner now, earl, like it or not.
we had a deal!  what was i, talking to the wall?
for christ's sake, booth, i just needed to take care of a few debts is all!  you got my word on it --i'm not going near it again until everything cools down.
you said that last time!
well i mean it this time.  come on.  let's get this over with!
i told him i bought the lingerie, as a surprise.  i do not think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
how the hell did he find it?
he started digging through my closet, something he never does.
great...
it is ok, booth, it is no big deal.
let's hope so. sally if he asks me again, I am going to tell him i returned it all.
dammit, I am so sick of this.
i know.
every night i think about you sleeping with him, him slobbering all over you.
he does not slobber, he just snores. and i told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
it does not matter...he's next to you.  you know, i always say to myself, you should have left him years ago. why did not you?
i used to think he was something, once...  i was eighteen, i did not know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
let's just get out of here, get out of this -- place.  we will drop out, get a house have some kids, get a satellite dish...
i hate it when you talk like this.  go on.
we'd... i do not know...go to california, new york, maybe a house on a swiss mountainside...
it would have to be switzerland to make sure dwayne never finds us.
so do i.
i love you sally.
i love you.
a satellite dish?
well i was just throwing out ideas...
jesse?
yeah whaddya want?.
I am at a payphone in vegas.  what is up?
vegas!  can you hightail it back here by three o'clock?
why?
well, we got the dea coming down here again, i do not know, sounds to me like they got some more questions they want to ask us.
about what?
well they really did not go into any details on the phone, but they did ask for you, and i figure we should try to help them out as best we can.
uh, sure.  i hear you.
so be here at three.
I will do my best...that does not give me much time.
i  have complete faith in you. but do not you go speeding.
yeah...see you at three.
hi ma.
hi.
i did not know you were coming.
i was in the neighborhood.
is that the mail?
yeah.
how is work?
well, same old same ol'.
people have been asking me about that story in the paper.  i told them you were the first person on the scene.  they were asking me for all the details.
it was pretty gory ma, let me tell you.  but you have to turn all that off, and do your job, just like pop used to say.
did they ever find out who they were?
nope. if you are a criminal you do not carry id, and if you do you are a damn fool.
i tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
at least around here it does.
are you hungry?
yeah sure I will grab something before i go...  hey -- I have got a surprise.
you do?
there was this raffle going on at the station, some charity or church was running it, i forget, so i figure what the hell put in my five bucks...
and what happened?
well basically i forgot about it, you know, you never win these things, but this time, well...
well what do you know!  an air conditioner.
and not just any air conditioner. this baby sells for over six hundred dollars retail.
that is great earl!
yep, fifteen thousand btu's, enough to cool off this whole place.
this whole place?
yeah.  figured you could have it.
do not you want it?
ah, hell I will get one soon enough.  besides, i want you to have it.
well i do not know --
you have done without it long enough, ma.
thank you honey.  are you sure you do not want it?
absolutely positively.
nice of you to join us.  i did say three o'clock, did not i?
well I am here now.
uh, no...
do not you think i would have told you that!
yeah?  so?
it is odd.  i do not know how denning had the time, or the ability to buy something local, based on his situation.
maybe.  maybe not.
what are you getting at?
well, unfortunately denning's not here to tell us, but i would say someone got their hands on that tape and switched it.
why would someone do that?
because they do not want anyone to hear what is on it, obviously.
something wrong, jesse?
no.  something wrong with you dwayne?
you walked in here looking like you just ate a shit sandwich.
well, i just got a lot of things on my mind is all.
what do you think about all this?
hell, i do not know.  if i had some input I would offer it up.
whatsamatter with you?  are not you concerned about all of this?
i can not get enough of it.
we are out of here.
right behind you.
oh that was agent wallace.  we are going to check into something.
maybe i should come along.
do not you have to be here?
hell no. besides I am just a radio call away if something happens. i feel i should keep abreast of what happens, seeing it is my jurisdiction and all.
mm-hmm...
meet me at the tumbleweed diner.
what?
just do it!  meet me there, now.
there is going to have to be a change in our arrangement.
what are you proposing?
i want my share. all of it.
I am not asking.
well you are not getting, either.
listen -
i do not like getting grilled by that dea bitch, i do not like taking that kind of heat!
none of us like it!
well i do not know what is going to happen next -- she is pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
just take it in stride.
I am not going to take --  I am not going to take it in stride.  i had a good run turn to shit on me like that -  cleaned me out.
what do you mean?  you gambled it?
i was on a roll!  im a little overextended now.
oh jesus christ...
so i want the money and i want it now.
well you can not have it.
you are out of your mind.
yeah, i mean you are coming unglued, jesse.
you want to see how more unglued i can get?  try me.
you are never getting that much.
i think i am.
you think he is bluffing?
no.
neither do i.
look, earl.  we gotta go straight. this is all messed up...
if you are any friend at all, you will stop talking like that!
maybe we can reason with jesse, give him a third in exchange for the tape.
i do not think he is going to be doing any bargaining with us, the stupid son-of-a-bitch!  besides, I am not giving him a third of anything, not after everything we had to do.
well what are we supposed to do?
i do not know...we have to shut him up somehow. booth looks at earl --
you are crazy.
how badly do you want that money?! how bad do you want to stay out of jail?
not bad enough to kill him.
who said anything about killing?  just keep driving straight...
mr. curtis called us this afternoon. the bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop.  came through a store called after midnight.  there is only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
is this marked money, or what?
some of it.  denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
so there was money there!  who the hell's money is it?!
we do not know.  whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system.
have you known this all along?
well you can understand why we did not say anything.  if word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
well yes i understand that, we do not want them high-tailing it out of here.
sheriff hogan --
dwayne.
dwayne...  it is imperative that we keep this confidential.	now we know someone is out there.  very close. it may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
fine.  the information does not leave this room.
ok...this is good.  our first solid lead.
did you say after midnight?
yeah.
what the hell is that, some kind of porno store or something?
not exactly.  it is some lingerie store on the strip.
lingerie...
yeah, racy stuff, you know the kind, right?
sure... dissolve to ext hogan house -- night
nothing.  nothing's the matter. sally are not you going to tell how your day went?
not much to tell.  nothing really happened.
that has not stopped you before.
suppose I am not exciting enough for you.
i did not say that.  you did.
well you might as well say it. mister small time...
just trying to be civil dwayne.
do not you want to hear about my day?
yeah let's hear about your day.
well i got the tires rotated, i went shopping, and i made dinner.
whatever...
look i worked all day, I am tired as hell and i want to sit and eat in peace!  is that asking too much?
no, dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the tv, and come upstairs and pass out.  and do it all over again tomorrow!
save me the sermon.  I have heard it all before, it is boring.
it certainly is...
i was beginning to think you were not going to show.  that can not be all of it.
no.  it is not.
what the hell are you doing, you crazy some bitches --
we are going to talk.
i do not suppose you will tell us where the tape is.
well it is not here -- you are wasting your time and you are pissing me off!
you do not expect us to believe that do you?
you better believe it if you know what is good for you!
how long is it going to take?!
i do not know!  shit, give me a break!
come on, booth.  do not let him do this!!!
do not have much choice, jesse. you saw to that!
you are only screwing yourselves over!  helllllp!  helllllp!  somebody!!!
shut up, jesse.
helllllp!!!!
do not hurt me.
we gotta, jesse.  it is tough, but you did not leave us any choice.  we got to know where the tapes are.
easy to purchase, hard to detect. too much potassium can kill a man.  just have to...pick a discreet spot.
stop!  stop!  i do not need the money.  you can have it all.
whoa, earl!
okay! it is under my desk!!  taped to the bottom side!!!
what are you doing, earl?
what are you thinking?  we were only supposed to scare him!
I am just making our intentions clear. go check the desk.
here it is.
there it is...now what about the others?
even if we have the tape, that would not shut him up!
you killed him...
it is going to be o.k.
like hell it is.  this is jesse! jesse!
jesus christ earl...what are we doing?...
we are doing what we got to do, to protect ourselves!
you do not know if he was really going to --
yes i do!  it never woulda stopped, you know that.  jesse's always going to be making mistakes and we would be paying for them for the rest of our lives.
maybe we should say somethin'.
come on. booth grabs the bag --
do you have everything?
i sure as hell hope so.  let's go.
hello.
hi.
anything i can help you with?
well i just uh, you know...
i have an anniversary coming up, thought I would buy her something special.
anything...specific?
well i do not know...
sixty five...  jeez louise!
we are having a sale on some items over here --
yeah, she is.  she comes up to about here on me.
hmmm...
i do not suppose you have seen her.
have i seen her?
shopping here?
no, i can not say that i have.
oh.
let's see...do you know her cup size?
uh...c?
c?
yeah I would say c...c.
do you know...34 c?  32 c?
no i don't.  you sure you havent seen her?
well...i should have done a little homework, getting all the sizes, and what not.
sure.
I am just not very good...with all of this stuff.
oh, that is ok, a lot of men feel uncomfortable when they come in here.
a lot of men come in here?
oh yeah.  between here and vegas we get a lot of customers.  all types.  even had an officer, just like you.
yeah, I have seen him.
what did he buy?
i do not remember.  we get a lot of people in here.
could it have been this?
be more specific.  a month, a week...
a week ago, at most.
thanks for your time.
he did not make it into work, and he is not home.
i knew it, i knew it all along - shit!
you think he skipped town?
we are going to find out.
how are we going to do all this?
I am going to quit.  that is what has to happen first.  then we are going to tell him.
i do not know, booth.
I will be there for you.  he will not try anything while I am there.  i promise.  I will protect you.
when do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
should not be long.  a couple of weeks maybe.
can you rely on how much they said you would get?
it will be more than enough.  we can get out of here...
yeah.
what do you think?  heart attack?
this is not right...
I am not getting an answer.
not getting an answer?  for christ's sake!  call 911!  let's get it locked down here!
why does that bother you?
I am not sure why.  it is just, I have never been anywhere else...
sally there is a whole world out there.  we can have a new home. a real home, not some tin-plated dump.  what are you giving up?
i do not know.  my friends...
we will meet new people. you might have friends out there you never met.
yeah, i guess you are right.  it is just...all so sudden...
yeah, it is...
i do not know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
it was all used.  random numbers. how can they trace it?
i do not know.  they got all kinds of high-tech shit nowadays.
then we are screwed.
no we are not.
we are not?  how do you figure that?
we will take the money and disappear! we can do it, spend it on the move. even if all of it is marked, there is ways around it.
we have got to go now, then.
that is right.
then sally comes too.
do you wanna tell me what that was all about?
yeah.  i want to tell you everything.
things just got a little screwed up, that is all.
i do not believe it.
i swear to you, it is true...
sally, do you love me?
you know i do.
you shut your mouth you son of a bitch!
dwayne put the gun down --
shut up!!!  slut!!!
you would do this to me?!
dwayne -
you would do this to me!
i should kill you right here! i never thought you would do this to me but i guess there is a lot i did not know about you!
dwayne listen to me -
shut up!  not another word out of you!  you are going down, the feds know all about it!  you did not know some of it was marked, did you! where is the rest?
i do not know what you are -
do not lie to me!!!!
dwayne please calm down!
calm down --
oh jesus...
he killed her...he killed her...
what happened?  what is earl doing here?
he found us, he shot her...he killed her...
booth, listen to me...booth!
he killed her...
we got to get out of here.  do you understand?  we got to get out of here right now!
no.  it stops now.  it stops here.
what do you mean?  look.  we can make still make it work.
dwayne's dead.
i know, i know.  dwayne's dead, but we can deal with it.  we will pin it on him.  the dea was driving jesse's car. no car phone.  no radio.  they could not have called me in.
what are you talking about?
dwayne had the opportunity, just like us.  he was at the scene.  he grabbed the cash.  of course.  this is perfect!
it is too late...
it is not too late!
yes it is.  I am calling it in.  right now.
you are the one who is nuts! there is no one left to touch us, booth.  we are home free!  we just plant a little of the money on dwayne, and it is all ours.
it is not about the money anymore. can not you see that?  it is about
just one more.  this one knocks off all the rest.
i can't.  i can not go on.  i can not keep lying...killing.  that is not me.  that is not us.
that will bring me down, too. eventually.  you got to know that.
uh huh.
and you are solid on that?
rock solid.
