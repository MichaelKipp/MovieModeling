you are carrying too much money on you, hank. you better turn some in tonight.
okay, matt.
how are you fixed?
I am okay, matt.
you have got enough?
say matt, I will have to have some money for those manville payrolls.
how much?
about twenty-four thousand.
it was more than that last week.
yeah.
here's twenty-five thousand.
say, do me a favor, will you charlie?
yeah.
let me have ten bucks?
ten bucks? say, if i had ten bucks, I would quit.
charlie!
yeah?
I will pay it back to you saturday - on the level i will. give a guy a break, will you? I have got to get it back in my account. if helen ever finds out that i
baby, i can not give you anything but love...
whose death?
it will be yours if you do not kick in with that ten bucks.
say pal, did you ever hear of a depression?
aw, nerts!
that mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
yeah, what did he do with his first one?
bought himself a pocketbook!
hello, helen!
matt, come here!
why?
come here, honey!
hey, look out, somebody is likely to see us!
oh, is that so?
mr. dickson in yet?
not yet, mr. clark.
when he comes in, tell him we are waiting for him in the board room.
yes, sir.
and tell him not to delay.
yes, sir.
personally, i think you are getting panic-stricken about nothing. dickson's all right.
oh, is he? we carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. we are fools to tolerate it.
do not make me laugh, schultz!
dickson does not have to go. but he must agree to this merger with new york trust
what good will that do?
what good will that do?  why, it will take control away from him. we will put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. that is what good it will do!
what did you do with it?
with what?
the ten dollars.
oh, ten dollars
yes.
a friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
no.
oh, you think I am lying?
yes.
all right, I am lying. do not forget you called me a liar.
oh, matt.
good morning, mr. dickson.
john, how is your wife this morning?
much better this morning, thank you.
got a handkerchief?
excuse me
wait a minute.  how do you feel this morning?
I am feeling fine this morning.
that makes it unanimous. i feel all right too.
thank you!
hello, tom.
you here again? what do you want?
what do you suppose anybody wants? money, money, money!
listen, i told you i was not interested in that deal, did not i?
i want to know why .
wait a minute. where is your uniform?
i have not any.
you have not got a uniform?
no, sir.
my goodness, you ought to have a uniform. how much does one cost?
why, i do not know.
you see sampson. tell him i sent you. you have got to have a uniform.
tom, i never had trouble getting credit from you before. when i was flat broke you gave me all the money i wanted. now i come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest
I will tell you why. i do not like the crowd you are mixed up with.  personally, you can have all the credit you want. but for that deal - not a cent.
but listen, tom, i
good morning, mrs. pembroke.
good morning, mr. dickson.
got my letter?
yes, thank you.
hello, helen.
good morning.
helen, you are becoming more beautiful every day. what are we going to do about it?
i do not know.
guess we will just have to sacrifice the bank. when are you and matt going to get married?
why - well, i
ummm. stalling, eh?  anything new?
why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
directors, eh? long faces?
longer.
i have not got any new stories for them this morning, either.
mr. dickson?
ah, mrs. pembroke. i spoke to mr. schaffer at the guaranty. he is going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
but, mr. dickson, i thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. i only want ten thousand. the property is worth sixty.
mr. schaffer will take good care of you. he will give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
what is the idea of turning her down? it sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
she is a widow. i do not like taking mortgages from widows.
why not?
if she can not pay, I will have to foreclose, will not i?
yes - sure
yeah - sure!
oh, make that uniform blue.
yes, sir.
say, you know, i found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. you have got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it is the only way you can hit anything
i think, mr. dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you do not mind.
oh, you would, eh?  all right. if it is more important than golf, go ahead. what is on your mind?
yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
is it safe?
absolutely.
it is his life insurance money, you know.
how are you protecting your depositors? by making a lot of idiotic loans!
take it easy, clark.
what is the matter with my policy? how many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  I will tell you. not a single one!  what is wrong with that kind of banking?
just pure luck!
character, hmmpf! that is your idea?
not at all. that is alexander hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. those are his exact words, gentlemen. character!  it is the only thing you can bank on, and it is the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
you know what we do to welchers, cluett, do not you?
i know, i know, dude. oh, i must have been crazy! i lost my head completely!
that is your funeral. we have got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
i have not got it.
then what did you want to gamble for? if you would have beat us out of fifty g's, you would have been paid, would not you? well, we want our dough.
I am sorry, dude, buti
that do not do us any good.
but after all, you can not take blood from a stone.
we can take blood from anything   if it is comin' to us.
good heavens, man! you are not suggesting that i
why not?
why, i could not do that . . . !
you do not have to do nothing.
what do you mean?
all you got to do is fix a few things for us , and we will do the rest, see?
how-do-you-do, mrs. dickson.
is that busy husband of mine busy?
he is at a board meeting.
board meeting. oh, that means hours, i suppose.
I am afraid so.
helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
no.
well, take my word for it, and do not try it. it is useless!  if it were some other woman, i could handle her, but after all, you can not scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
hardly.
oh, well. i guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. when he comes out, you tell him I will be back. he has not gotten rid of me!
all right.
dude - there is not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
you? no, you will be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
know, but
be sure you are with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. understand?
but dude, listen - could not we make this some other time?
listen, buddy, you are getting by pretty easy. quit squawking!
this will not do. not during business hours . . .
why, i needed a
what is the matter with you? you are trembling?
am i? why, i - i do not know any reason why i should be, unless of course it is you . . .
me?
being alone with you has always done this to me. you know that.
for a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. besides, i never knew that any female could do this to you .
well, you can. you always could.
liar! you are just suffering from lack of sleep.
here, here, here, now! do not you go back to work on me, too. I am getting tired of this. besides, it is beginning to affect your looks
what is?
running around. not your work.  you would better start reforming, cyril!
if i thought you were the slightest bit interested, i would.
not bad, not bad at all. do you know something? I have always been curious about your line.
line?
whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
come on cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. i have not had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day i was married.
but you see, it is not blarney where you are concerned.
now let me see, what comes next?  oh yes, i know - what are you doing tonight, phyllis?
does not that come next?
yes, yes, it does. what are you doing tonight, phyllis?
see, we are getting along famously!
most of the creditors i know personally. I have seen them grow up in the community. i knew their fathers and mothers before them.
i know, dickson. that is all very well. but you are taking too many chances. in these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. in case of emergency!
I am running this bank my way. get that clear!
gentlemen, you notice mr. dickson refuses to consider our wishes. he refuses an offer to merge with the new york trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. he insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
yes! you said it, clark. that is the only thing that means anything to me.
helen, tell matt i want to see him.
yes, sir.
oh! oh, no!  i think I have done enough experimenting for one day. congratulations, cyril. you have convinced me that you are a philanderer of the very first order. i shall recommend you highly.
please, please do not laugh at me, phyllis. i must see you tonight!
but I am giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I am really terribly excited about it. I have been planning it for months.
well
well, what?
well, are not you going to invite me?
you? no can do. it is all set. just a few of tom's closest friends.
now phyllis, if you do not invite me, I am coming anyway.
do not be silly, cyril. these are respectable people. they would probably bore you to death.
no, they won't. not when you are there. oh, please, be a sport. please ask me.
why are you so anxious?
do not you know?
no.
i want to be near you!
what?
do not you know I have been crazy about you for years?
now wait a minute, wait a minute...
I have loved you ever since i can remember, long before you married tom dickson.
why, cyril, you are insane
no. no, I am not. i deliberately avoided you. i was afraid of making a fool of myself. but i will not stand it any longer
cyril!
say, i just heard the merger is not going thru. is not that grand?
yeah, swell.
it is all right. thanks.
and what is more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you will be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  not a bad thought, eh?
what is the matter? you do not seem very excited about it.
sure, i think it is swell.
say, come on. show a little enthusiasm. what is the matter? are you sick or something? go on, fake it - even if it is not real.
aw, I am sorry, mr. dickson. it is just kind of sudden, that is all.  sure, I am excited. i think it is great. only, well, you have done so much for me already . . . I will never be able to thank you enough.
aw, go on, forget it. you came through, did not you? that is all i wanted. a lot of them did not think you would. you do not know how much satisfaction it is been to me. it is been swell. well, when are you and helen going to get married?
well, i
i suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
well, look who is here! hello, dear.
hello, darling.
if this is not a red-letter day for tom dickson! first i trample on the board of directors, then i promote matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day i have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. what a man, what a man!
it is amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
oooh! that has the earmarks!
what happened? what did he say? did you get the job?
yeah.
what is the matter, matt? gee, i thought you would be thrilled to death.
come here.  you know, a few minutes ago i was in cluett's office and mrs. dickson was there.
well . . . ?
well, he was making love to her.
oh matt, you must be mistaken.
i tell you, i saw them!
in cluett's office?
yes, right in his office, the rat. I would like to take a crack at that guy.
yes?
helen, I am going to philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. make all the arrangements, will you?
yes, sir.
what is the matter dear? what have i done now?
nothing. tom, i thought you were going out with me tonight.
oh, i did have a date with you tonight, did not i?
yes.
I am terribly sorry. I would forgotten all about you. I am so sorry, dear.
now tom, you simply cannot go to philadelphia tonight. that is all there is to it.
but i have to go, dear. it is a very important banker's meeting.
i do not care whether it is important or not. you said you were going out with me, and if you had not promised so faithfully, i would not have gone and planned the whole thing.
listen, it is not so terribly important. we can go to the theatre any time.
the theatre?
that is what it was you planned, was not it?
yes, of course.
you can take some of the girls. you can take mildred - or gwynn
the girls!  i do not suppose it ever occurred to you that i might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
ho! ho! ho!
ho, ho, ho, yourself! i would not laugh if i were you. you may not suspect it, but I am still attractive - to some.
listen, do not go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
well . . .
do not you forget that I am still the head man around here too. now we will get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. you and i are going out together. how is that?
tomorrow night?
all right. I will postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
happy now?
no.
yes?
mr. sampson . . .
all right. send him in.
well, sampson, what is it?
here's the data on the clyde deal.
good. I will take this along with me. tell clyde I will see him tomorrow. I am sick and tired of the delay.
I am afraid he is been stalling.
that is just exactly what he has been doing. this deal should have been closed weeks ago. tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
he says he can not get away in the daytime.
how about his nights? he is too busy running around. tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I will call this whole deal off.
yes, sir.
everybody in?
i guess so.
where is charlie?
charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. he is out fourteen cents, and he can not find it.
what is keeping you?
oh, charlie again.
say matt, you have not done anything about what you saw today, have you?
who? cluett? no, not yet. but I would like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
oh now, do not be silly.
can you imagine that guy? he was kissing her.
now you have got me worried, dear.  promise me you will not butt in.
okay, honey - but just the same I would like to take a crack at that
shh . . . !  I will wait for you upstairs.
all right, dear.
where you been?
where do you think I have been?  i took the baby for a stroll in the park.
what is the matter, charlie?
I am fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. and me with a date, too.
i remember once when your account checked.
yeah.
and listen, wise guy - I am setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
say, do not annoy me. i got troubles of my own.
are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
yes, sir.
let me see your cash book, will you?
now?
yes, now.
what is this?
my apartment.
i knew i could not trust you. you told me you were taking me home.
come on up for just a few minutes. we will have just one drink, then we will go.
no. i know the answer to that one.  i think you would better take me home.
what is the matter? afraid papa will spank?
no. no, I am afraid papa is not that much interested. he is too busy rushing off to philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. too busy closing big, important deals  i think i will have a drink.
good for you. come on.
you know, there ought to be a congressional medal for men like you. america's comfort to misunderstood wives. i never thought i would find myself in that class.
oh, you are not so badly off. there is something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
what is that, mr. bones?[7]
a misunderstood bachelor.
and now fair woman, i have you in my power.
I am not afraid of you. you have not got a moustache!
I will grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
why, matt!
what are you doing here?
the butler said i could stay. i told him it was important.
oh, yeah?
well, i thought I would like to have a little talk with you.
I am listening.
it is funny - now that I am here, i do not know just how to go about it.  you see, i kind of expected to find you here alone.
anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.
oh no, mr. cluett, if it is all the same to you, I would rather not wait. it is about you and mrs. dickson.
I am not interested in what you think.
you have no right to do this to her, mr. cluett. why do not you think it over? it is only going to get you into a lot of trouble.
i tell you, I am not interested in your opinion.
no?  then maybe you will understand, mrs. dickson. oh, gee, he is crazy about you. nobody knows it better than you. if he ever finds out, it will kill him.
phyllis, you do not have to explain anything.  you would do well to mind your own business.
this is my business. mr. dickson's been like a father to me.  what has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
that will be just about enough! now get out of here!
i guess i have said enough  I am just wasting my breath talking to you.
oscar, what is the matter?
i was the first one to see it. i was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
no kidding?
no kidding. when i saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
where is matt?
matt?
yeah. he will have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
the detectives got matt up there in sampson's office.
he has?
yeah.
you turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, did not you?
was not anywhere near this place
sit down! when the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what did you do with the gun?
i did not do it! i have not got a gun!
you used to carry a gun, did not you?
shall we let the people come in?
of course, let them in! you are late now.
oh, mr. dickson - they are going to arrest matt. they think he did it!
where is he now?
in mr. sampson's office.
now do not you worry about it.
what is the matter? what is going on here?  this is ridiculous! you can not hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
I am afraid i must, mr. dickson.
why pick on him ?
it is an inside job. that is a cinch. whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. now brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, is not he?
yes.
then who changed it?
i do not know.
what time did this thing happen?
the clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
all right. if the boy proves an alibi, he is all right, is not he?
if he can do it, yes.
why, certainly he can.  matt, now all you have got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.
i already told him i was home.
there you are.
that is what he says. i got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
good.  you have got nothing to worry about. soon as the report comes in, you will be released.  and listen, do not talk so loud. take it easy. coast a little.
all i know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. the way i see it, brown here looks guilty.
what are you talking about? he had no more to do with it than you did.
maybe. but I am taking no chances.  why, this kid's got a record.
so have you. so have i. so's everybody got a record. what difference does that make? you can not go around pinning crimes on people just because they
the lobby's half filled now.
what are you talking about?
they have been coming in steady all morning. i have called for some extra police.
all right. send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
we have not much on hand, you know. if it gets any worse, i hope we do not have to close the doors.
the bank's reputation would not be worth a nickel after that. this is just a flurry, that is all. they have heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. wait a minute. get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
yes, sir.
we want to talk to you.
what about?
we will discuss that in the board room.
so you were home last night?
yes.
what time did you get in?
well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
eleven o'clock, eh? are you sure it was that?
yes.
do you know this young man, mrs. halligan?
sure i do. he has the best room in me house. the one with the fancy wallpaper.
for the rheumatism, you know.
what time was it, mrs. halligan?
it was late, i know. the dooley sisters was already in. they work at a show, you know.
what time was it?
huh?
what time did matt brown get in?
now, let me see - a half hour after the dooley sisters - and the dooley sisters never get home until after
i do not care about the dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
that is just what I am trying to tell you, sir. it was a half hour after the dooley sisters . . .
was it twelve o'clock?
yes, i guess it was one, 'cause...
it could not have been earlier?
no. it was not earlier because...
yes, i know. cause the dooley sisters were not in yet.
no - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it is one.
there you are!
listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it
that is all, mrs. halligan. thanks.
of course it is true - and he knows it.
listen, matt. if you do not tell the truth, i can not help you. where were you last night?
but i was not here, mr. dickson. honest i was not . . .
then where were you?
wait a minute. wait a minute.  matt, do you realize you are up against something? you are being charged with murder. it is serious, son. now come on, i know you did not do it.  but we have got to make them believe it. come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
i can not tell you.
no. i won't.
you are protecting somebody.
no, I am not mr. dickson!
yes, you are. you are protecting somebody. now listen, it does not make any difference who it is. it can not be as important as this. now come on, tell me. where were you last night?  come on, do not be a fool. matt, you trust me, do not you?
look at them, mr. dickson. they are going crazy.
did you get the case for the securities?
yes, sir.
mine too?
yes, sir. but soon as our money runs out, they will mob the place.
the fools! if they only knew it, they are making things worse for themselves. somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
what will we do?
I will talk to them. listen, go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible. tell 'em not to pay any attention to what i said. tell 'em to verify every signature.
we can not keep open till four o'clock. we have not cash enough to last an hour.
do not you think i know it?
we will be forced to shut the doors. I have worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. you have all made money out of it. are you willing to help?
what do you mean, help?
i know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. get that money over here and I will stop this run within five minutes.
that sounds very simple, dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
i have everything i own in it. it is your bank as well as mine, is not it?
the depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. you thought they were your friends. why do not you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
aw, they have gone crazy. you can not reason with a mob.
no. you can not reason with anyone else when you are in a jam. we pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you would not listen to us. you preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. now you want our help. you want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you have wrecked. all right. there is one way you can get it. give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
so, that is it, eh? you have waited a long time for this chance, have not you?  well, I am not going to resign now - or ever.
say, you can not do that
i can't? you just wait and see. if that run does not stop within the next hour, I will shut the doors. you know what that means? the bank examiner will step in tomorrow. you will be forced to liquidate. I will insist upon it. the depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. what is left you gentlemen can have. but I will guarantee there will not be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
mr. dickson! mr. dickson!
get all the big bills in the place. take them out and get them changed. get nothing but ones and fives. distribute them among the tellers. tell them to take their time. stall as much as possible. count and recount the money.
yes, sir.
i hate to do this, but I have got to have time to dig up some help. i think i know where i can get some real cash. snap into it, sampson. we will lick this thing yet.
come on in here, helen. bring your book. i want some numbers to try to get some action. get parker at the union-leeds - the exchange . . . winslow and old man harris at the home mortgage. snap into it, helen. just as quick as you can.
yes, sir.
you know dickson as well as we do. he will shut the doors before he gives up control.
all right, let him! I am sick and tired of hearing about him. if he wants to run the bank, let him do it. i do not want any part of it.
oh, matt . . .
do not cry, honey. everything's going to be all right.
what did you find out, mike?
I have been trailing the cashier like you told me. you are right about that guy, chief. there is something screwy somewhere.
never mind all that. what did you find out?
he left here about an hour ago and went down to dude finlay's joint.
dude finlay?
yes, sir.
did you say dude finlay?
yes, why?
he was in the bank yesterday.
he was here?
he came to see mr. cluett.
are you sure?
yes, sir.
quiet down, please! take it easy, folks. everything will be all right.
but you said it would be safe! it is his life insurance money. oh, please, I will go to the old ladies' home if you do not do something, please!
please, lady. please be quiet. everything will be all right.  open up here, folks. all right, folks, please!
i hope you do not mind me asking you a few questions, mr. cluett.
of course, yes. just what would you like to know, inspector?
where were you at twelve of the clock last night?
that is very simple. i was home.
that is simple, is not it? i assume you can prove that if necessary.
oh yes, of course. there was someone with me. a lady.
looks like you are going to have no trouble at all. what was the lady's name, mr. cluett?
if you do not mind, inspector, I would rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. you see, she is married.
oh!
you understand?
why, of course.
thanks.
somebody must be in good humor. he was humming "mother machree."
it is one of the boys from headquarters. he always sings "mother machree" whenever he is got good news. looks like this case'll be settled in no time.
stand back inspector, or I will shoot. drop that gun.
all right, jack, all right.
do not be a fool, cluett. this is only going to make it worse for you.
stand back, inspector. let me out of here, or I will shoot you!
you were right, mr. dickson! brown did not have anything to do with it. here's your man.
why, you must be crazy. I have known this man for years.
he is just confessed. he is been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
confessed! cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
i do not know. it is all been like a crazy nightmare, mr. dickson.
what happened?  you are not a thief. how did you get mixed up with these kind of people?
gambling - i owed them a lot of money. last week i lost over fifty thousand dollars!
fifty thousand dollars!
but i did not kill that man last night. honest i didn't, mr. dickson!
what were you doing at finlay's this morning?
they took my keys yesterday. i went there to get them back.
i was crazy, i tell you, mr. dickson. i did not know what i was doing. i wandered around in a daze. all i could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  you will stand by me, will not you, mr. dickson? you will not go back on me now, will you? I will die if they send me to prison!
do not forget there is a dead watchman downstairs.
i did not kill him! i had nothing to do with that, i tell you! i was home in my apartment last night - i can prove it!
claims he was there with a married woman. does not want to mention her name.
he will not believe it, mr. dickson. but it is the truth - honest it is. i was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she
my wife? what is she got to do with you?
no wonder he did not want to mention her name.
what was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
nothing, nothing, mr. dickson. do not pay any attention to me. i do not know what I am saying.
you just mentioned her name. what was she doing there? what was she doing in your apartment?
she just came up for a drink. just for a few minutes.
you are lying!
do not worry, mr. dickson. we will find out whether he is telling the truth. I will have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
you do not want to check up on anybody. I will do all the checking up. wait a minute.
helen!
yes?
get mrs. dickson on the phone.
listen, dear. i want to ask you something. i know it is a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . i want you to tell me the truth. where were you last night?
last night? er - why - uh, last night . . .
listen, dear. now tell me the truth about this. were you in cluett's apartment?
in cluett's apartment? well dear, you see, i . . . i . . .
she was not to blame, mr. dickson. it was not her fault. honest, it wasn't. i begged her to come up. she did not
get out, get out!
dickson, I would like to talk to you about the bank.
the bank. all right. do anything you want with it.
you want the rest of those numbers, mr. dickson?
numbers? no, never mind.
what is he doing, honey? is he getting any help?
something is happened. he is not trying anymore.
they must have turned him down.
yes. he called some of the biggest people in town.
sure, they would turn him down. he ought to know that. I am going in there and talk to him.
we have not got much time left, mr. dickson. we have got to do something quick or it will be too late.
why would not you tell me where you were last night?
you are not giving up, are you, mr. dickson?
were you in cluett's apartment?
oh, i can explain about that later. you are losing your bank - do not you realize what that means?
was mrs. dickson there?
listen, mr. dickson, do not let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. you have got more friends than anybody in this town. little guys - guys who would not be in business if it were not for you. all you have got to do is
wait a minute. answer my question. was mrs. dickson there?
well . . . uh . . . i . . .
she was, was not she? how long has this been going on? do you know?
aw, i do not know what you are talking about. all i know is that you are losing your bank and
all right. that is all.  please, matt.
did you talk to him?
yeah.  i got an idea. come on, let's get to a telephone.
dickson's in a jam i tell you. the run's getting worse.
mr. williams . . .
the big guys have got the screws on him. you have got to come through for him, mr. conway. he came through for you a hundred times. if his friends do not help him, who is going to help him?
matt, look! there is mr. jones!
certainly, mr. jones! certainly! charlie!
they are starting to come in already. yeah. yeah. well, listen. do not waste any time. get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. step on it.
come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
we have been waiting fifteen minutes
you know what you can do with that! come on, take a look at this! you will see a demonstration of faith that is worth more than all the collateral in the world.
good morning, mr. dickson. my wife is much better this morning.
well, that is too bad. mine's all right too.
well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
yes, sir.
looks good. how much did it cost?
i do not know. mr. sampson bought it for me.
good morning, helen.
good morning.
say, i know what is the matter with you. matt!
i want you both to take the day off. go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
but i have not . . .
i do not want to hear any more about it. if you do not get married, I will fire both of you.
helen, while you are downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the berengaria sailing next week.
gee, thanks, mr. dickson
oh!
oh, no! it is not for you. you are only going to get married. mrs. dickson and i are going to go on the honeymoon.
