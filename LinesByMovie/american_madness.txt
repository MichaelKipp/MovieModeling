you're carrying too much money on you, hank. you better turn some in tonight.
okay, matt.
how are you fixed?
i'm okay, matt.
you've got enough?
say matt, i'll have to have some money for those manville payrolls.
how much?
about twenty-four thousand.
it was more than that last week.
yeah.
here's twenty-five thousand.
say, do me a favor, will you charlie?
yeah.
let me have ten bucks?
ten bucks? say, if i had ten bucks, i'd quit.
charlie!
yeah?
i'll pay it back to you saturday - on the level i will. give a guy a break, will you? i've got to get it back in my account. if helen ever finds out that i—
baby, i can't give you anything but love...
whose death?
it'll be yours if you don't kick in with that ten bucks.
say pal, did you ever hear of a depression?
aw, nerts!
that mug reminds me of a guy with his second dollar.
yeah, what did he do with his first one?
bought himself a pocketbook!
hello, helen!
matt, come here!
why?
come here, honey!
hey, look out, somebody's likely to see us!
oh, is that so?
mr. dickson in yet?
not yet, mr. clark.
when he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
yes, sir.
and tell him not to delay.
yes, sir.
personally, i think you're getting panic-stricken about nothing. dickson's all right.
oh, is he? we carry more unsecured paper than any other institution in the city. we're fools to tolerate it.
don't make me laugh, schultz!
dickson doesn't have to go. but he must agree to this merger with new york trust—
what good will that do?
what good will that do?  why, it will take control away from him. we'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. that's what good it will do!
what did you do with it?
with what?
the ten dollars.
oh, ten dollars—
yes.
a friend of mine - yeah, really - his mother was terribly sick and she was dying, would you believe it?
no.
oh, you think i'm lying?
yes.
all right, i'm lying. don't forget you called me a liar.
oh, matt.
good morning, mr. dickson.
john, how's your wife this morning?
much better this morning, thank you.
got a handkerchief?
excuse me—
wait a minute.  how do you feel this morning?
i'm feeling fine this morning.
that makes it unanimous. i feel all right too.
thank you!
hello, tom.
you here again? what do you want?
what do you suppose anybody wants? money, money, money!
listen, i told you i wasn't interested in that deal, didn't i?
i want to know why .
wait a minute. where's your uniform?
i haven't any.
you haven't got a uniform?
no, sir.
my goodness, you ought to have a uniform. how much does one cost?
why, i don't know.
you see sampson. tell him i sent you. you've got to have a uniform.
tom, i never had trouble getting credit from you before. when i was flat broke you gave me all the money i wanted. now i come to you with a swell deal, and the greatest—
i'll tell you why. i don't like the crowd you're mixed up with.  personally, you can have all the credit you want. but for that deal - not a cent.
but listen, tom, i—
good morning, mrs. pembroke.
good morning, mr. dickson.
got my letter?
yes, thank you.
hello, helen.
good morning.
helen, you're becoming more beautiful every day. what are we going to do about it?
i don't know.
guess we'll just have to sacrifice the bank. when are you and matt going to get married?
why - well, i—
ummm. stalling, eh?  anything new?
why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
directors, eh? long faces?
longer.
i haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
mr. dickson?
ah, mrs. pembroke. i spoke to mr. schaffer at the guaranty. he's going to take care of that mortgage for you . . .
but, mr. dickson, i thought you were going to take care of the mortgage. i only want ten thousand. the property is worth sixty.
mr. schaffer will take good care of you. he'll give you fifteen - maybe twenty . . .
what's the idea of turning her down? it sounds like a perfectly safe investment.
she's a widow. i don't like taking mortgages from widows.
why not?
if she can't pay, i'll have to foreclose, won't i?
yes - sure—
yeah - sure!
oh, make that uniform blue.
yes, sir.
say, you know, i found out something yesterday about hitting a golf ball. you've got to hit with the left hand, and from the inside out, it's the only way you can hit anything—
i think, mr. dickson, we would like to have a little of your very valuable time here at the bank this morning, if you don't mind.
oh, you would, eh?  all right. if it's more important than golf, go ahead. what's on your mind?
yes, ma'am, you can deposit your money here.
is it safe?
absolutely.
it's his life insurance money, you know.
how are you protecting your depositors? by making a lot of idiotic loans!
take it easy, clark.
what's the matter with my policy? how many losses has this bank taken in the last twenty-five years?  i'll tell you. not a single one!  what's wrong with that kind of banking?
just pure luck!
character, hmmpf! that's your idea?
not at all. that's alexander hamilton's idea[5] - the finest banking mind this country has ever known. those are his exact words, gentlemen. character!  it's the only thing you can bank on, and it's the only thing that will pull this country out of the doldrums.
you know what we do to welchers, cluett, don't you?
i know, i know, dude. oh, i must have been crazy! i lost my head completely!
that's your funeral. we've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
i haven't got it.
then what did you want to gamble for? if you'd have beat us out of fifty g's, you'd have been paid, wouldn't you? well, we want our dough.
i'm sorry, dude, but—i—
that don't do us any good.
but after all, you can't take blood from a stone.
we can take blood from anything —  if it's comin' to us.
good heavens, man! you're not suggesting that i—
why not?
why, i couldn't do that . . . !
you don't have to do nothing.
what do you mean?
all you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
how-do-you-do, mrs. dickson.
is that busy husband of mine busy?
he's at a board meeting.
board meeting. oh, that means hours, i suppose.
i'm afraid so.
helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
no.
well, take my word for it, and don't try it. it's useless!  if it were some other woman, i could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
hardly.
oh, well. i guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. when he comes out, you tell him i'll be back. he hasn't gotten rid of me!
all right.
dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
you? no, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
know, but—
be sure you're with somebody responsible in case any questions are asked. understand?
but dude, listen - couldn't we make this some other time?
listen, buddy, you're getting by pretty easy. quit squawking!
this won't do. not during business hours . . .
why, i needed a—
what is the matter with you? you're trembling?
am i? why, i - i don't know any reason why i should be, unless of course it's you . . .
me?
being alone with you has always done this to me. you know that.
for a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. besides, i never knew that any female could do this to you .
well, you can. you always could.
liar! you're just suffering from lack of sleep.
here, here, here, now! don't you go back to work on me, too. i'm getting tired of this. besides, it's beginning to affect your looks—
what is?
—running around. not your work.  you'd better start reforming, cyril!
if i thought you were the slightest bit interested, i would.
not bad, not bad at all. do you know something? i've always been curious about your line.
line?
whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
come on cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. i haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day i was married.
but you see, it isn't blarney where you're concerned.
now let me see, what comes next?  oh yes, i know - what are you doing tonight, phyllis?
doesn't that come next?
yes, yes, it does. what are you doing tonight, phyllis?
see, we're getting along famously!
most of the creditors i know personally. i've seen them grow up in the community. i knew their fathers and mothers before them.
i know, dickson. that's all very well. but you're taking too many chances. in these times a bank should keep liquid in case of trouble. in case of emergency!
i'm running this bank my way. get that clear!
gentlemen, you notice mr. dickson refuses to consider our wishes. he refuses an offer to merge with the new york trust - the only thing that will put this bank on safe ground. he insists upon running a bank on so flimsy a thing as . . . as faith!
yes! you said it, clark. that's the only thing that means anything to me.
helen, tell matt i want to see him.
yes, sir.
oh! oh, no!  i think i've done enough experimenting for one day. congratulations, cyril. you've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. i shall recommend you highly.
please, please don't laugh at me, phyllis. i must see you tonight!
but i'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. caps, bells, whistles, and everything. i'm really terribly excited about it. i've been planning it for months.
well—
well, what?
well, aren't you going to invite me?
you? no can do. it's all set. just a few of tom's closest friends.
now phyllis, if you don't invite me, i'm coming anyway.
don't be silly, cyril. these are respectable people. they'd probably bore you to death.
no, they won't. not when you are there. oh, please, be a sport. please ask me.
why are you so anxious?
don't you know?
no.
i want to be near you!
what?
don't you know i've been crazy about you for years?
now wait a minute, wait a minute...
i've loved you ever since i can remember, long before you married tom dickson.
why, cyril, you're insane—
no. no, i'm not. i deliberately avoided you. i was afraid of making a fool of myself. but i won't stand it any longer—
cyril!
say, i just heard the merger isn't going thru. isn't that grand?
yeah, swell.
it's all right. thanks.
and what's more, keep up the good work and who knows - some day you'll be the fellow sitting behind that desk . . .  not a bad thought, eh?
what's the matter? you don't seem very excited about it.
sure, i think it's swell.
say, come on. show a little enthusiasm. what's the matter? are you sick or something? go on, fake it - even if it isn't real.
aw, i'm sorry, mr. dickson. it's just kind of sudden, that's all.  sure, i'm excited. i think it's great. only, well, you've done so much for me already . . . i'll never be able to thank you enough.
aw, go on, forget it. you came through, didn't you? that's all i wanted. a lot of them didn't think you would. you don't know how much satisfaction it's been to me. it's been swell. well, when are you and helen going to get married?
well, i—
i suppose you want me to fix that up for you too, eh?
well, look who's here! hello, dear.
hello, darling.
if this isn't a red-letter day for tom dickson! first i trample on the board of directors, then i promote matt here to assistant cashier, and now to complete the day i have a visit from my sweet and lovely and gorgeous wife. what a man, what a man!
it's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
oooh! that has the earmarks!
what happened? what did he say? did you get the job?
yeah.
what's the matter, matt? gee, i thought you'd be thrilled to death.
come here.  you know, a few minutes ago i was in cluett's office and mrs. dickson was there.
well . . . ?
well, he was making love to her.
oh matt, you must be mistaken.
i tell you, i saw them!
in cluett's office?
yes, right in his office, the rat. i'd like to take a crack at that guy.
yes?
helen, i'm going to philadelphia, just as soon as the bank closes. make all the arrangements, will you?
yes, sir.
what's the matter dear? what have i done now?
nothing. tom, i thought you were going out with me tonight.
oh, i did have a date with you tonight, didn't i?
yes.
i'm terribly sorry. i'd forgotten all about you. i'm so sorry, dear.
now tom, you simply cannot go to philadelphia tonight. that's all there is to it.
but i have to go, dear. it's a very important banker's meeting.
i don't care whether it's important or not. you said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, i wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
listen, it isn't so terribly important. we can go to the theatre any time.
the theatre?
that's what it was you planned, wasn't it?
yes, of course.
you can take some of the girls. you can take mildred - or gwynn—
the girls!  i don't suppose it ever occurred to you that i might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
ho! ho! ho!
ho, ho, ho, yourself! i wouldn't laugh if i were you. you may not suspect it, but i'm still attractive - to some.
listen, don't go around being attractive to anyone but me . . .
well . . .
don't you forget that i'm still the head man around here too. now we'll get the tickets changed for tomorrow night. you and i are going out together. how's that?
tomorrow night?
all right. i'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
happy now?
no.
yes?
mr. sampson . . .
all right. send him in.
well, sampson, what is it?
here's the data on the clyde deal.
good. i'll take this along with me. tell clyde i'll see him tomorrow. i'm sick and tired of the delay.
i'm afraid he's been stalling.
that's just exactly what he has been doing. this deal should have been closed weeks ago. tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
he says he can't get away in the daytime.
how about his nights? he's too busy running around. tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or i'll call this whole deal off.
yes, sir.
everybody in?
i guess so.
where's charlie?
charlie's upstairs as sore as a pup. he's out fourteen cents, and he can't find it.
what's keeping you?
oh, charlie again.
say matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
who? cluett? no, not yet. but i'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
oh now, don't be silly.
can you imagine that guy? he was kissing her.
now you've got me worried, dear.  promise me you won't butt in.
okay, honey - but just the same i'd like to take a crack at that—
shh . . . !  i'll wait for you upstairs.
all right, dear.
where you been?
where do you think i've been?  i took the baby for a stroll in the park.
what's the matter, charlie?
i'm fourteen cents out, and it took me half an hour to find the mistake. and me with a date, too.
i remember once when your account checked.
yeah.
and listen, wise guy - i'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
say, don't annoy me. i got troubles of my own.
are the payrolls ready for tomorrow?
yes, sir.
let me see your cash book, will you?
now?
yes, now.
what's this?
my apartment.
i knew i couldn't trust you. you told me you were taking me home.
come on up for just a few minutes. we'll have just one drink, then we'll go.
no. i know the answer to that one.  i think you'd better take me home.
what's the matter? afraid papa will spank?
no. no, i'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. he's too busy rushing off to philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. too busy closing big, important deals—  i think i will have a drink.
good for you. come on.
you know, there ought to be a congressional medal for men like you. america's comfort to misunderstood wives. i never thought i would find myself in that class.
oh, you're not so badly off. there's something much worse than being a misunderstood wife.
what is that, mr. bones?[7]
a misunderstood bachelor.
and now fair woman, i have you in my power.
i'm not afraid of you. you haven't got a moustache!
i'll grow a moustache by the time you get out of here.
why, matt!
what are you doing here?
the butler said i could stay. i told him it was important.
oh, yeah?
well, i thought i'd like to have a little talk with you.
i'm listening.
it's funny - now that i'm here, i don't know just how to go about it.  you see, i kind of expected to find you here alone.
anything you have to say to me, you can say in the morning.
oh no, mr. cluett, if it's all the same to you, i'd rather not wait. it's about you and mrs. dickson.
i'm not interested in what you think.
you've no right to do this to her, mr. cluett. why don't you think it over? it's only gonna get you into a lot of trouble.
i tell you, i'm not interested in your opinion.
no?  then maybe you'll understand, mrs. dickson. oh, gee, he's crazy about you. nobody knows it better than you. if he ever finds out, it'll kill him.
phyllis, you don't have to explain anything.  you'd do well to mind your own business.
this is my business. mr. dickson's been like a father to me.  what has he ever done to you to deserve a deal like this?
that will be just about enough! now get out of here!
i guess i have said enough  i'm just wasting my breath talking to you.
oscar, what's the matter?
i was the first one to see it. i was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying dead at my feet.
no kidding?
no kidding. when i saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
where's matt?
matt?
yeah. he'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
the detectives got matt up there in sampson's office.
he has?
yeah.
you turned off the burglar alarm, you set the time clock, came back at twelve and emptied the boxes, didn't you?
wasn't anywhere near this place—
sit down! when the watchman surprised you, you shot him - what'd you do with the gun?
i didn't do it! i haven't got a gun!
you used to carry a gun, didn't you?
shall we let the people come in?
of course, let them in! you're late now.
oh, mr. dickson - they're going to arrest matt. they think he did it!
where is he now?
in mr. sampson's office.
now don't you worry about it.
what's the matter? what's going on here?  this is ridiculous! you can't hold this boy on a vague suspicion.
i'm afraid i must, mr. dickson.
why pick on him ?
it's an inside job. that's a cinch. whoever did it had a pretty good picture of the layout. now brown, here, is in charge of the vaults, isn't he?
yes.
then who changed it?
i don't know.
what time did this thing happen?
the clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
all right. if the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
if he can do it, yes.
why, certainly he can.  matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.
i already told him i was home.
there you are.
that's what he says. i got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
good.  you've got nothing to worry about. soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  and listen, don't talk so loud. take it easy. coast a little.
all i know is the bank's been robbed and a murder's been committed. the way i see it, brown here looks guilty.
what are you talking about? he had no more to do with it than you did.
maybe. but i'm taking no chances.  why, this kid's got a record.
so have you. so have i. so's everybody got a record. what difference does that make? you can't go around pinning crimes on people just because they—
the lobby's half filled now.
what are you talking about?
they've been coming in steady all morning. i have called for some extra police.
all right. send down to the vaults and have our reserve cash sent up here right away.
we haven't much on hand, you know. if it gets any worse, i hope we don't have to close the doors.
the bank's reputation wouldn't be worth a nickel after that. this is just a flurry, that's all. they've heard about the robbery and got panic-stricken. listen, get a hold of our available securities and have them turned into cash. wait a minute. get my personal stuff and have that turned into cash too. tell the boys anyone caught arguing with a depositor will be fired on the spot.
yes, sir.
we want to talk to you.
what about?
we'll discuss that in the board room.
so you were home last night?
yes.
what time did you get in?
well, about - uh - eleven o'clock.
eleven o'clock, eh? are you sure it was that?
yes.
do you know this young man, mrs. halligan?
sure i do. he has the best room in me house. the one with the fancy wallpaper.
—for the rheumatism, you know.
what time was it, mrs. halligan?
it was late, i know. the dooley sisters was already in. they work at a show, you know.
what time was it?
huh?
what time did matt brown get in?
now, let me see - a half hour after the dooley sisters - and the dooley sisters never get home until after—
i don't care about the dooley sisters - what time did he get in?
that's just what i'm trying to tell you, sir. it was a half hour after the dooley sisters . . .
was it twelve o'clock?
yes, i guess it was one, 'cause...
it couldn't have been earlier?
no. it wasn't earlier because...
yes, i know. cause the dooley sisters weren't in yet.
no - because me clock struck four, and when it strikes four, it's one.
there you are!
listen here, young man - nobody ever called me a liar yet and got away with it—
that's all, mrs. halligan. thanks.
of course it's true - and he knows it.
listen, matt. if you don't tell the truth, i can't help you. where were you last night?
but i wasn't here, mr. dickson. honest i wasn't . . .
then where were you?
wait a minute. wait a minute.  matt, do you realize you're up against something? you're being charged with murder. it's serious, son. now come on, i know you didn't do it.  but we've got to make them believe it. come on, tell the truth, where were you last night?
i can't tell you.
no. i won't.
you're protecting somebody.
no, i'm not mr. dickson!
yes, you are. you're protecting somebody. now listen, it doesn't make any difference who it is. it can't be as important as this. now come on, tell me. where were you last night?  come on, don't be a fool. matt, you trust me, don't you?
look at them, mr. dickson. they're going crazy.
did you get the case for the securities?
yes, sir.
mine too?
yes, sir. but soon as our money runs out, they'll mob the place.
the fools! if they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
what'll we do?
i'll talk to them. listen, go back and tell the boys to stall as much as possible. tell 'em not to pay any attention to what i said. tell 'em to verify every signature.
we can't keep open till four o'clock. we haven't cash enough to last an hour.
don't you think i know it?
we'll be forced to shut the doors. i've worked twenty-five years night and day to keep this bank alive. you've all made money out of it. are you willing to help?
what do you mean, help?
i know that among you, you have at least a million dollars in various banks throughout the city. get that money over here and i'll stop this run within five minutes.
that sounds very simple, dickson, but why should we jeopardize our personal fortunes?
i have everything i own in it. it's your bank as well as mine, isn't it?
the depositors you were protecting were the first ones to pounce on you. you thought they were your friends. why don't you go out there now and try and get some help from them?
aw, they've gone crazy. you can't reason with a mob.
no. you can't reason with anyone else when you're in a jam. we pleaded with you to keep liquid, but you wouldn't listen to us. you preached to us about faith and a lot of other rubbish. now you want our help. you want us to throw a lot of cash into a bank that you've wrecked. all right. there's one way you can get it. give us an option on your stock and resign as president.
so, that's it, eh? you've waited a long time for this chance, haven't you?  well, i'm not going to resign now - or ever.
say, you can't do that—
i can't? you just wait and see. if that run doesn't stop within the next hour, i'll shut the doors. you know what that means? the bank examiner will step in tomorrow. you'll be forced to liquidate. i'll insist upon it. the depositors will be paid one hundred cents on the dollar. what's left you gentlemen can have. but i'll guarantee there won't be enough to pay your next month's garage bill.
mr. dickson! mr. dickson!
get all the big bills in the place. take them out and get them changed. get nothing but ones and fives. distribute them among the tellers. tell them to take their time. stall as much as possible. count and recount the money.
yes, sir.
i hate to do this, but i've got to have time to dig up some help. i think i know where i can get some real cash. snap into it, sampson. we will lick this thing yet.
come on in here, helen. bring your book. i want some numbers to try to get some action. get parker at the union-leeds - the exchange . . . winslow and old man harris at the home mortgage. snap into it, helen. just as quick as you can.
yes, sir.
you know dickson as well as we do. he'll shut the doors before he gives up control.
all right, let him! i'm sick and tired of hearing about him. if he wants to run the bank, let him do it. i don't want any part of it.
oh, matt . . .
don't cry, honey. everything's gonna be all right.
what did you find out, mike?
i've been trailing the cashier like you told me. you're right about that guy, chief. there's something screwy somewhere.
never mind all that. what did you find out?
he left here about an hour ago and went down to dude finlay's joint.
dude finlay?
yes, sir.
did you say dude finlay?
yes, why?
he was in the bank yesterday.
he was here?
he came to see mr. cluett.
are you sure?
yes, sir.
quiet down, please! take it easy, folks. everything will be all right.
but you said it would be safe! it's his life insurance money. oh, please, i'll go to the old ladies' home if you don't do something, please!
please, lady. please be quiet. everything will be all right.  open up here, folks. all right, folks, please!
i hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, mr. cluett.
of course, yes. just what would you like to know, inspector?
where were you at twelve o'clock last night?
that's very simple. i was home.
that is simple, isn't it? i assume you can prove that if necessary.
oh yes, of course. there was someone with me. a lady.
looks like you're going to have no trouble at all. what was the lady's name, mr. cluett?
if you don't mind, inspector, i'd rather not say - that is, unless it becomes absolutely essential. you see, she's married.
oh!
you understand?
why, of course.
thanks.
somebody must be in good humor. he was humming "mother machree."
it's one of the boys from headquarters. he always sings "mother machree" whenever he's got good news. looks like this case'll be settled in no time.
stand back inspector, or i'll shoot. drop that gun.
all right, jack, all right.
don't be a fool, cluett. this is only going to make it worse for you.
stand back, inspector. let me out of here, or i'll shoot you!
you were right, mr. dickson! brown didn't have anything to do with it. here's your man.
why, you must be crazy. i've known this man for years.
he's just confessed. he's been mixed up with the toughest gangsters in town.
confessed! cluett, in heaven's name, what got into you?
i don't know. it's all been like a crazy nightmare, mr. dickson.
what happened?  you're not a thief. how'd you get mixed up with these kind of people?
gambling - i owed them a lot of money. last week i lost over fifty thousand dollars!
fifty thousand dollars!
but i didn't kill that man last night. honest i didn't, mr. dickson!
what were you doing at finlay's this morning?
they took my keys yesterday. i went there to get them back.
i was crazy, i tell you, mr. dickson. i didn't know what i was doing. i wandered around in a daze. all i could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  you'll stand by me, won't you, mr. dickson? you won't go back on me now, will you? i'll die if they send me to prison!
don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
i didn't kill him! i had nothing to do with that, i tell you! i was home in my apartment last night - i can prove it!
claims he was there with a married woman. doesn't want to mention her name.
he won't believe it, mr. dickson. but it's the truth - honest it is. i was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she—
my wife? what's she got to do with you?
no wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
what was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
nothing, nothing, mr. dickson. don't pay any attention to me. i don't know what i'm saying.
you just mentioned her name. what was she doing there? what was she doing in your apartment?
she just came up for a drink. just for a few minutes.
you're lying!
don't worry, mr. dickson. we'll find out whether he's telling the truth. i'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
you don't want to check up on anybody. i'll do all the checking up. wait a minute.
helen!
yes?
get mrs. dickson on the phone.
listen, dear. i want to ask you something. i know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . i want you to tell me the truth. where were you last night?
last night? er - why - uh, last night . . .
listen, dear. now tell me the truth about this. were you in cluett's apartment?
in cluett's apartment? well dear, you see, i . . . i . . .
she wasn't to blame, mr. dickson. it wasn't her fault. honest, it wasn't. i begged her to come up. she didn't—
get out, get out!
dickson, i'd like to talk to you about the bank.
the bank. all right. do anything you want with it.
you want the rest of those numbers, mr. dickson?
numbers? no, never mind.
what's he doing, honey? is he getting any help?
something's happened. he isn't trying anymore.
they must have turned him down.
yes. he called some of the biggest people in town.
sure, they'd turn him down. he ought to know that. i'm going in there and talk to him.
we haven't got much time left, mr. dickson. we've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
you're not giving up, are you, mr. dickson?
were you in cluett's apartment?
oh, i can explain about that later. you're losing your bank - don't you realize what that means?
was mrs. dickson there?
listen, mr. dickson, don't let them lick you just because a couple of big shots turned you down. you've got more friends than anybody in this town. little guys - guys who wouldn't be in business if it weren't for you. all you've got to do is—
wait a minute. answer my question. was mrs. dickson there?
well . . . uh . . . i . . .
she was, wasn't she? how long has this been going on? do you know?
aw, i don't know what you're talking about. all i know is that you're losing your bank and—
all right. that's all.  please, matt.
did you talk to him?
yeah.  i got an idea. come on, let's get to a telephone.
dickson's in a jam i tell you. the run's getting worse.
mr. williams . . .
the big guys have got the screws on him. you've got to come through for him, mr. conway. he came through for you a hundred times. if his friends don't help him, who is going to help him?
matt, look! there's mr. jones!
certainly, mr. jones! certainly! charlie!
they're starting to come in already. yeah. yeah. well, listen. don't waste any time. get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. step on it.
come out here you pawnbrokers - take a look at this!
we've been waiting fifteen minutes—
you know what you can do with that! come on, take a look at this! you'll see a demonstration of faith that's worth more than all the collateral in the world.
good morning, mr. dickson. my wife is much better this morning.
well, that's too bad. mine's all right too.
well, well, well - got your uniform, eh?
yes, sir.
looks good. how much did it cost?
i don't know. mr. sampson bought it for me.
good morning, helen.
good morning.
say, i know what's the matter with you. matt!
i want you both to take the day off. go downtown and get a license and get married right away!
but i haven't . . .
i don't want to hear any more about it. if you don't get married, i'll fire both of you.
helen, while you're downtown, you might stop in and make reservations for the bridal suite on the berengaria sailing next week.
gee, thanks, mr. dickson—
oh!
oh, no! it's not for you. you're only going to get married. mrs. dickson and i are going to go on the honeymoon.
