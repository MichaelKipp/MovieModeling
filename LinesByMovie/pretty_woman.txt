at least stay for a drink.  this party's for you.
apologize to elizabeth for me.
listen, there are some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...

cynthia's not coming?
no.
love this car!  is it new?
yes!  and you do not even know where you are going!
yeah, what?
rent.  you are late.
do not give me that.  kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
kit give me nothin'.
you bullshittin' me?
of rent i do not bullshit.
you spent it on drugs, did not you?
hi, viv.  carlos, you know my roommate, viv.
carlos had some great rock.
i bet.  that was our rent!
we worked for that money.  we were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.
viv... do not be stupid.  we are whores.
i just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  i wonder how much she made tonight?
do not be mad at me.  I will pay you back.  i promise.
i thought you were giving up that drug shit.
i will.  I am trying.  meanwhile i got some crack left, you wanna get high?
no, let's go to work.  okay?
okay.  I am sorry i said your dream was stupid.
looks slow tonight.
maybe we should get a pimp. carlos likes you and --
forget it.  we work for it.  we keep it.
i can not handle this tonight. I am going home.
that crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  there is not even milk in the fridge.  the rent's due.  now come on --
hey, hey -- there is a rent.
he is not going to want us.
hey sugar, you lookin' for a date?
what is that?
you looking' for some company?
uh, no.  how do i get to beverly hills?
what?  you going to tell me you are lost?
yes.
great.  what do i look like a tourguide?
no, you look like a hooker.
actually, I am a movie star out for a walk.
good.  can you tell me how to get to beverly hills?
sure.  for five bucks.
that is ridiculous.
the price just went up to ten.
why do not you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
sit... and spin.
sit-and-spin.  alright... why not?
nice car.  yours?
no.
stolen?
not exactly.
mind if i turn on some heat?
if you can figure it out, be my guest.
very good.  you are obviously mechanical.
you are not from l.a., huh?
new york.
what motel you staying at?
hotel.
okay, what hotel?
regent beverly wilshire.  i bet you know it.
yeah, i peed in the fountain there once.  give me a break.
what is your name?
what do you want it to be?  vivian, my name's vivian.
you like being a hooker, vivian?
it pays.
so do day jobs.
day jobs, yeah.  I have tried them.  turn right.
must be dangerous.  hooking.
tell me about it.  l.a. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. and who knows where half the guys i pick up have been.  i mean, i use condoms.  always.  and i get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  not only am i better in the sack than an amateur, I am probably safer.
very good.  you ought to have that printed up on your business card.
if you are making fun of me, i do not like it.
sorry.  if i did, i did not mean to.
ugly habit, biting your nails.
you do not know habits, you think this is ugly.
what do you charge for company, vivian?
company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
for the whole night?
for an hour.
you are joking.
i never joke about money.
neither do i.  a hundred bucks an hour though. that is pretty stiff.
no, but it is getting there.
vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
you could not afford it.
three hundred.
fine.
what is your name, lover.
edward.  my name is edward.
edward... you got it!
get in.  this side.
what?
you know how to drive a stick?
better believe it.
then let's go.  it is worth 300 just so i do not have to drive.
my raincoat's in the back.  put it on.
why?
you may feel more comfortable. this is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
you mean they do not have hookers.
every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they do not look like they're...
off the boulevard.
exactly.
room service.  what do you drink?
diet coke.
send up a bottle of crystal champagne.
can i have some chips?
-- and a bowl of strawberries. thank you.
want to know something?  i do not quite know.  i had not planned this.
do you plan everything?
always.
well, the meter's running, it is your money.  speaking of which, cash'll do.  in advance.
fair enough.
let's talk some more first.
right.  so!  in town on business?
uh-huh.
let me guess, you are a... lawyer.
and why do you say that?
i dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
sounds like you have known a lot of lawyers.
I have known a lot of everybody.
i think he wanted you to tip him.
tsk.  excuse me, i did not think he had change for a hundred.
where are they?  shopping together?
they should be.  they are both good at it.
it is a very good year.
oooh, thank god.
try a strawberry.
why?
because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
jesus, you act like you are seducing some valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.
you really are a very beautiful girl.
just a romantic, that is you.
yes...
what do you like?
if i want you to turn me on I will pay you three hundred.  just lay back and let me drive.
i want to.
edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the wall street journal.
I will see him alone.  everyone knows you are my muscle.  we will make it social.  tell kross I will meet him for dinner.  tonight if you can arrange it.
you should not go alone.  he might claim that you tried to black mail him.
bill, we are businessmen, not the damn mafia.  I will see you in the office.  by the way, about your car...
oh, god, what?
I will bring it back.
good morning.
you did not wake me.  I will be out of here in a minute.
no hurry.  would you like some breakfast?
did you sleep well?
yeah.  too good.  i forgot where i was.
occupational hazard?
where did you go?
i took the couch.  i had some work to do.  about last night...
oooh, baby, you were the best. i was beside myself.
mmm, i could tell.
i just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
I would say you give a good dollar value.
do you ever... enjoy it?
i like guys if that is what you are asking.  not that i trust'm.
no?  why is that?
"occupational hazard".
i buy companies.
no shit.  they expensive?
the one I am buying this week will cost around 150 million.
... dollars?
so what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
i sell them.
what?  why?
by breaking up a company's assets --
what are assets?
vivian --
c'mon, i might buy a company some day.
assets are anything of value a company owns.  sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole.  by selling them off, i make a profit.
sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
not... quite.
there, see?  now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
where did you learn to do this?
i fucked the debate team in high school.  tsk.  i had a grampa. he liked ties on sundays.  you mind if i take a swim in your bathtub before i hit it?
do not drown.
edward, did you hear me?
I am here.
i know a lot of nice girls.
all right.  how much for the week?
what?
I am in town until saturday.
it would cost you.
of course.  how much?
five full nights... days too?
four thousand.
vivian, may i point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
but you want days too.
all right, two thousand.
three.
done.
holy shit.
I am not just talking about sex.
look butthead, I will treat you so nice you will never want to let me go, okay?
three thousand for five days. and vivian, i will let you go.
'lo.
kit!  where have you been?
i was asleep.  you woke me.  you okay?
kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the ferrari, I am at this hotel, the regent beverly wilshire, it is this absolutely unbelievable place and he is hired me for a whole week and kit, listen, he is paying me three thousand bucks!  we can get out of the apartment.  we can get out of this town.  we can do anything!  kit?  hey, you there?
why did he want you?
he... he just does.
I am sorry, viv'.  carlos has been on my back.  did you get the money up front like i taught ya'?
three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  now listen, I am going to leave an envelope for you at the front desk. give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  spend it on drugs and I will pull your hair out.
I am getting dressed now.  I will be over.  bye.
hey kit, where do i go for the clothes?  good stuff on him.
in beverly hills?
yeah.
baby!  rodeo drive.
may i help you?
I am just looking, thanks.
are you looking for something in particular?
yes.  something... conservative.
yes...
you have beautiful things.  how much is this?
i do not think it would fit you.
i did not ask if it would fit. i asked how much it was.
it is very expensive.
what is with you?
excuse me?
I am going to spend money.
i do not think we have anything for you here.  you are obviously in the wrong place.
I am just going to my room.
you are a guest here?
I am -- I am with a friend.
and who is that?
i... edward...
what is your name?
vivian.
miss vivian... things that go on in other hotels do not happen at the regent beverly wilshire.
niece?
of course.  naturally when mr. harris leaves, i will not see you in this hotel again.
what is that long building over there?
storage, i think.
not with those smokestacks it is not.
the real estate possibilities are endless.  most of the yard we will just level.  i talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --
you what?
i talked to some developers about the land.
what!?
we do not have the time to bring someone new up to speed. besides...  you have already impressed everyone you need to, have not you?
what time's diner tonight?
eight o'clock.  kross is bringing his son.  very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  who is this girl you are taking?
no one you know.
georgia.
no wonder.  for starts, you should know that hot pants are horrid, even when you do have the legs to carry them off.  what are your plans while you are in town?
well... i might be going out to dinner.
you will want a cocktail dress then.  turn.  you have a beautiful figure.  a little too out in the open but simply lovely.  size six? do you need shoes?
i dunno.  do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
philip!  we will need shoes!
your uncle will like this.
he is not really my uncle.
they never are, dear.
i got a dress.
i rather hoped you would be wearing it.
i did not want to get it messed. i got shoes too.  wanna see?
that is all right.  I am sure they are quite lovely.
they were real nice to me there. they treated me, y'know... nice. thanks, barney.
never answer the phone.  ever.
tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
did you buy some clothes?
i got a dress, yeah.
just one?  christ... i hope it is appropriate.
it is very tasteful.  i think you will especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I am -- joking.
let's hope so.  you will get some more clothes tomorrow.  I will be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp.  got it?
no, i do not "got it".  even the farmboys back in georgia come to the door when they are taking you on a date.
this is not a date.
go by yourself then.  where you taking me anyway?
the rex.
any good?
i think you will approve.
... all right.  I will meet you in the lobby.  but only cause you are paying me to.
thank you very much.
hello?
i thought i told you not to answer the phone.
oooh!
housekeeping.  i come to turn down the bed.  5:00, i turn down the bed.
what?
housekeeping.  i come to turn down the bed.
okay.
is that all?  you just fold back the bedspread?
i also place las chocolates on the pillow.
oooh, i love those.
i leave extras, miss.
thanks!  consuelo, are all rich people so lazy they can not do this on their own?
what is it, miss vivian?
edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  the rex.  ever been there?
it is a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
yeah, mine too.  is it like, y'know, normal?
i think you will find it normal enough.
will i like it?
you will like it fine.
okay.  thanks, barney.  you are the best.
in fifteen minutes i can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the queen.  first, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.
but i always eat like this.
either you are european or badly brought up.
hmmm... i vonder vich.
actually, some of the richest people i know have the worst manners.  of course, mr. harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table.  all right now, pay attention please.  salad fork.
what if they serve soup?
they will serve salad.
but what if they serve soup?
then you use your soup spoon.
i like steak.
then you would use your--
steak spoon!
miss vivian --
maybe I will just order a burger, barney, that way i can eat with my hands.
miss vivian... there is a salon here in the hotel.  instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why do not you just have your hair done instead?
professionally?
barnard thomas, manager of the hotel.
of course, yes.  if you will excuse me just a moment --
i have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
my what?
the young lady staying in your room?
mr. harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly.  the young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.
thank you.
I am sorry.
you are forgiven.
mr. harris, we know you have purchased at least twenty percent of our stock.  we also know you plan to file a formal bid for a majority share.
twenty-five percent.
what would it take to buy our stock back?  name your price.
to get me in a mood to sell -- double what i paid.  but your company does not have enough capital right now to buy anything.
we are on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  we would give you a promissory note...
you are not getting any navy contracts.
there is no way you could know that.
but i do know.  i also know your lines of credit are over-extended. if i do not buy your company, someone else will...  ah, the escargot.
mr. kross, I am not here to sell you my stock.  on the contrary, I am here to buy yours.
you have got a lot of nerve.
no.  what i have is a lot of money.
i know all about you, mr. harris. when you buy companies, they have a way of disappearing.  even the pension funds are stripped clean. the last three companies you took over were cut up in so many pieces, widows were left without their retirement checks.
what i did with those companies was perfectly legal.
i do not question the legality of what you do.  it is your morality that makes me sick.  i will not allow my company to be raped by a man like you.
it is not your company.  it is a public company.  and i am going to acquire it.  either i buy from the other stock holders, or i buy from you.
we can reach an understanding on this.
i do not think so.  you should know we are going to fight you with every resource we have.
do what you have to do.  i do not take it personally.
i do.  i take it all very personally.  very nice meeting you, vivian.
and that is the way the game is played.
some game.  screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
you are upset, huh?
upset.  no.  i never get upset about business.
you liked the guy, though.
whether i liked him or not is irrelevant.  it is business. there is no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
we are the exactly the same!  kit keeps telling me do not get emotional when you turn tricks -- that is why no kissing -- it is too personal. the key is like you are saying, stay numb, do not get involved -- when I am with a guy, I am a robot, i just do it.  except with you.  at your price i give my all...
know what we are going to do in a little while then?  we are going to call domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  we are going to eat it in bed.  we are going to veg' out and watch television.
television?
yeah, it is this box, it has pictures, sound.  you do not have to use your brain at all.
i have work to do.
uh-uh.  no work.
i still do not understand why you only bought one dress.
i was not as much fun as i thought it was going to be.
why not?
well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  it works.
was someone rude to you?
i had a little problem in one store.  i was not dressed right. i do not know what to say.  i do not belong there.  maybe I will just go back to bridget.  she was cool.
vivian, you belong wherever you are.  i do not care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.
okay.
good.
come with me?
goddamit!  where is he getting the money to fight?
someone is loaning it to him. get on it right away.
our contract guys are working on the kross pension funds. there is another forty million there.  we can bleed'm dry.
put the pension funds on hold until i say otherwise.
we are letting them slide?
i want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
but, edward...
do it.
would you like to try it on?
'scume me.
yes?
do you remember me?
no, I am sorry, i don't.
i was in here yesterday.
excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? first, you go soft on the pension funds.  now, you are giving him the chance to get away?  as of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
come on, bill, do not talk to me about how much money's involved. it is my money.
and some of it is mine.  edward, his jugular's exposed.
i thought maybe you would like dinner.
thank you.  i would.  nice.
wait till you see what i have on underneath.
please.
what about dinner?
dinner can wait.
you always been rich?
no.
seems like it.  i guess it is easy to get used to, huh?
easier than learning how to be poor.  my father's family was wealthy. when i was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies.  but then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman.  and he took his money with him.
keep talkin'.  i like hearin'.
not much to tell.  i went to public school.  went to university on scholarship.  went to work for an investment firm. in eight years i owned it.  my father was chairman of the board of the third company i ever went after.  i swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. one of the pieces was him.
you still mad at'm?
he died a long time ago.
you are really pushing it, bringing me here.
i think it is exciting.
what id we run into someone i know?
i really doubt anyone here frequents hollywood boulevard.
you did.
bill, I would like you to meet vivian.
bill stuckey, vivian.  my wife, elizabeth.
real genuine guy.
he is good at what he does.
you could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  she anything like your ex?
shall we mingle?
edward, these women here, i do not think any of'm like the guys they are with.  they are just into it for the money.
I am sure that is true for some of them.
i thought i was the pro.  these women make me feel like an amateur.
ready to stomp sod?
i like your hat.
huh?  oh... yeah.  s'okay?  uhm... how're... business things going.
let's not talk about it, it is too depressing.  come on, I will show you thunder.
please, we hardly know each other.
thunder's a horse.  come on.
hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  i am.  this is vivian.  you two been together long?  you and edward?
no.
hope to be?
it's... it is not like that.
i see.  well.  maybe that means you would have lunch with me sometime then.
you do not know anything about me.
I would like to find out.  you do not know anything about me either. that is why people have lunch.
fill me in on this.  how did you and vivian meet?
we just did.
come on, you can tell me.  i sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
the night i left your house, i was lost.  i was looking for directions.
and you just happened to run into her.  great.  what is she do?  she work?
yes...
doing what?
vivian's in sales.
sales, really?  that is great. what does she sell?
why do you want to know?
hear me out.  I have known you a long time.  i see a difference in you this week.  like that tie. I am suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. especially when i see her talking with david kross.
she met him at dinner last night... i like this tie.
so now they are best friends? edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now i see her talking to a guy whose company we are trying to buy.  it is too convenient.
you are being ridiculous.
industrial espionage is not ridiculous.  edward, how do you know she has not attached herself to you so she can bring kross back information?
christ, bill, she is not a spy, she is a hooker.  i picked her up off hollywood boulevard.
having a good time, vivian?
yeah.  thanks.
all this must be quite a change from hollywood boulevard.
what?
it is okay.  edward told me.  your secret's safe with me.
yeah.  sure.  why not.  call me at the regent beverly wilshire.
i just might do that.
you asshole!  i can not believe what a --!
vivian, what the --
clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  what are you trying to prove!?  I am not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
i do not know what you are talking about.
I have been with stinking old men who have made me want to puke but I have never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
would you please calm down.  tell me what happened.
stuckey!  he wants an "appointment" with me after you leave.  you my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?
what was i supposed to do?  i told the truth.  why should the truth upset you?  it is not as if you are from a convent.
i want my fucking money.  I am getting out of here.  i do not want anything more to do with you.
can we talk about this?  can you just try to calm down?
your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I am with you is for the money.
well, it is true.  just pay me what you owe me and I am gone.
vivian...
pay me!  before i pick up this chair and smash your face in.
fine.  I am only here a couple of more days and I am not going to spend them fighting with you.
fuck off.
I will call you a cab.  if you want the clothes, pack them up.
vivian... I am sorry.  i was not prepared for questions about us. it was an idiotic and insensitive thing i did.  i should have known that it would hurt you.
I am not hurt.  it does not hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
i really am sorry.
this is no time to disappear. we are in too far.
bill?  stop panicking.  kross is not going anywhere and i do not need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down.  I will be in the office tomorrow.
promise me you will read those contracts by then.
goodbye, bill.
good afternoon, mr. harris.
afternoon.
do i look okay?
hmm... let's see... no, there is something missing.
what is that?
i do not want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
edward, i can't.
shush.  of course you can.
what if i lose it?
you won't.
what if someone tries to steal it?
I will guard them and you with my life.
you do not want to go all the way to san francisco in a limousine, do you?  i don't.
where are you taking me!?
to meet some friends.  rudolpho, a poet... benoit, a landlord... mimi, a flower maker...
huh?
the opera.
I have never been on a plane before.
I am glad you like it.  now be quiet, I have really got to read these.
sorry.  you are not paying me to ask you question like that.
vivian.  I am paying you to be you.  be you.  have you?  ever been in love with anyone?
you mean, besides elvis?  I am a human being.  sure.  once. first time i ever ran away from home, i got as far as atlanta. i met this boy.  he would been with his parents on their way to chicago.  they stopped at a gas station.  he went to the john. when he came back they would split. we sorta started looking out for each other.  aw, he was sweet. and boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. the chicken hawks were on him all the time.  he hated that. sometimes we would find a safe place to crash nights and we would curl up together and we would talk about all these crazy things.  the two of us getting married someday. having kids.  stupid stuff.
what happened to him?
if it is in italian, how will i know what they are saying?
I will whisper some of the main parts of the story to you.  but you will be surprised how much you understand.  the music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
but do not they have it in english?
vivian, do not be afraid of what you do not know.  that is the fun of it.
if you would gone on about how much you liked it, I am not sure I would have believed you.
i more than liked it.
i know.  I am glad.
did you?
yes.  I have never enjoyed it more. thank you.
did i wake you?
I am up.
i had to call.  i jus got off the phone with james kross.  get this.  he wants to see you. today.
why?
he would not say.  edward... i think we got him.  his nuts are on the block and we got him.  you there?
give me twenty minutes.
we will be there.  listen, if he is really caving in, we will go from there down to the office.  i want him to commit his stock to us this morning.
one more night and you are finally rid of me.
yeah, you have been pretty tough to take.
i have to go to new york tomorrow.
what else?  you gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
it would not be like that.  i want to get you off the street.  you will have a different kind of life. what is wrong with that?
I am sorry.  that is very sweet, edward, and i know you mean it...
vivian, I have thought about this a lot.  this is the best solution.
when i was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when i was bad, which was pretty often. I would stare out the window up there and make believe i was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. rescue me from the tower, and then we would ride off... but never, ever in all the times i had that dream did the knight say, "come on baby, I will put you up in a great condo."
vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
i know.  hey, do not mind me.  I am being stupid.  I will think about it, okay?  it is a real good offer for a whore.
I have never treated you like a whore.
you just did.
mr. harris.
how are you, mr. kross.
not bad for a man who has not slept in four nights.  I will get used to it.
yes.  I am here to tell you that I have reconsidered my position on your acquisition offer.
expected... offer.
of course, yes.  after the expected filing period is over, I am going to recommend to the board that we accept your bid.
you are making the right decision, sir.
what did you do to him?
what do you mean?
last time i saw him he was this strong guy.  now he is beaten. and you liked him.
vivian, i want you to listen to me.  the man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
right.
it is not your concern.  it's... business, that is all.
business.
yes.  the man made a business decision.
it is all just business to you. him.  me.  your life. everything's business.
it is what i do for a living. it is how i make money.
barnard thomas here.  miss vivian, i wonder if you might come down to the front desk.  there is someone here to see you.
me?
I would send them up, but sadly, i do not trust the young lady to find you on her own.
yes, I am glad you are clean but I have been calling and calling.
was that you?
who did you think?
carlos.  i still owe him two hundred bucks...
kit, i left that money for you days ago.
yeah.  i just got it.
kit...
everybody keeps starin' at me.
yeah... i know what you mean.
what do you know?  you look good. all dressed up.  you clean up real nice.  you sure do not fit in down on the boulevard, lookin' like you do.  not that you ever did anyway.
you think i fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
where do you fit?
i kissed him, kit.  on the mouth.
honey, you are not supposed to do that.
i know.  i stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
oh, my god, you mean it was good?
it was great.
dummy.
he wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
i pray for that.
all I am doing is feeling lousy about it.  i do not know what to do.  what do i do, kit?
go for the bucks.
i do not care about bucks.  i might love this guy.
wow, are you in deep shit.  you know he will break your heart.
congratulations, sir.
what?
mr. kross is just getting off the phone with his stock broker. it is finished.  you have won.
who are you going after next, sir?
who indeed...
stop.  for just a moment.  mr. kross, I would like to ask you a few questions before you sign. you realize that you are a target. if you were not mine, you would be someone elses, correct?
yes.
if you had a... reprieve, what would do?
i do not think there is any sense in --
let him answer.
i... i would take advantage of it.
how?
i... i do not know.  there... there was not time...
i suppose you would find out soon enough that you have assets you presently do not seem aware of, would not you?  the waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you would certainly find out about that.
oh, my god... edward, no!
i suppose you would use them as collateral on new loans, would not you?
have you lost your mind?
quiet.  would i get the loans?
this time i imagine you would, yes.  hmm...  with all this in mind, mr. kross, i can not logically make a formal bid on your company, can i?
you would be initiating a financial battle you would ultimately lose, mr. harris.
you are very right.  i think the best thing we could all do is go home.
what!?
have a good day, gentlemen.
do you want to know what he did? do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did?  he handed the whole thing back to kross! on a silver platter.  for no reason!  what was he thinking, i mean, what was going through his goddam head?  why?  what was all that benevolent crap?  what are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation?  I will probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.
i think it is great.
i bet.  a lousy whore and you are the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.
aw, come on, bill.  it is just business.
get out!
do not worry.  I will pay for it. what a you charge?  huh?  twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, maybe?  are you a fifty dollar whore?
you broke my nose.
i think i broke my hand.  you are fired.
edward, we have been together ten years.
and i do not like what we have become.  I will cover any losses you have on this one.  now get out, you asshole!
all this because of that whore!
yes.
why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  what do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? it pisses me off!
not all men hit.  and no one is going to hit you anymore.
right.  you are quite the sir galahad today, are not ya'?  i heard what you did with kross.
it was a business decision.
i got tired of hating my father.
it was good.
it felt good.
you are packing.
I am leaving.  do not ya see?  if i stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they are allowed to.  what are you going to do, fight'm all? no.  I will take my money now, please.
aw, don't... no...
stay with me tonight.  not because you are being paid to. stay with me because you want to.
i do.  i do want to.  that is why I am leaving.  that is what you given me, see? i know what i want now.  i want a guy like you for real.  not because you buy me things and give me money.  the nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. you going to give me that?
i did not think so.
vivian...
it is not your fault.  you are right.  kit's right.  but i want the fairy tale.
hi, barney!
miss vivian.
look i just wanted to say goodbye.
mr. harris does not check out until tomorrow.
yeah, well, i check out today.
you are not accompanying him to new york?
come on, barney, you and me live in the real world.  you do not know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, mr. thomas.
certain ladies make that very easy... vivian.  john, call a limousine for our guest, please.  have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  bill the hotel.  see you again sometime soon.
so whatta' you going to do in san francisco?
get a job and probably go back to school.  figure out what I am going to be.
what kind of school?
school, school.  regular.  i used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
so did i.  i made it with the principal.  study hard and get a "b."  lift your dress and an "a" you will see.
want a pair of boots?
do i!?  momma!
you sure you will not come with me?
and leave all this?  not in a million.
couple a hours.
yeah.  well... i got to split. goodbye's make me crazy.
cool your jets a second.  here's some money.
no.  you took care of rent, that is enough.
i want to.  for food, got it? eat something before the wind blows you away.
I am going to pay you back next time i see ya, babe.  just wait, I am going to do something real nice for you some day.
