two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.

hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
check!
you look different... more relaxed.
it is the lights. and the scotch.
how come you did not catch your bus?
i was not waiting for a bus.
then why go to the bus station?
same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you have not much choice. besides, i only live three blocks from there. where do you live?
around.
i know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. what is it like living in a locker?
cramped.  you always drink like this, so early in the morning?
do you always ask so many questions?
no, not always.
sometimes i wake up and i can not sleep, not without a drink. the bars do not open until eight. mack over there has faith in me. when I am broke, he trusts me. do not you trust me, mack?
you talk kind of funny, but i like it.
i used to be an actress.
yeah? what do you do now?
I am a college girl. two days a week, tuesdays and thursdays, i go to college.
you do not look like a college girl.
I am the emancipated type. real emancipated.
no, i did not mean that -- whatever that means. i mean, you just do not look young enough.
I am not.
so why go to college?
I have got nothing else to do on tuesdays and thursdays.
what do you do on the other days?
i drink.
hey!
no. no more. I am getting sleepy.  thank you very much, mr...?
eddie. the name is eddie.
the name should be eddie. what should my name be?
i do not know. whatever you like it to be.
i like it to be what it is. it is sarah. that is a biblical name. you want to know its meaning?
i could always get us a bottle.
no.
fifth of scotch?
what do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? is that it?
no. I will take you home.
hey, uh, mister? hey, okay if i grab a cue?
hey, you are eddie felson, are not you?
who is he?
now, look, fella, i saw you playing at ames the other night.
hey, I will tell you what -- I will play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
oh man, you are way out of our league.
why did you do that?
i wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
a day like any other. people come, people go.
give me a drag.
what time is it?
eleven o'clock... I will be back later.
why?
come here.
oh, you need a shave. you must not go looking like that. there is a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. compliments of the house.
what did you say that for, sarah?
how did you know my name was sarah?
you told me.
i lied. when I am drunk i lie.
okay. so what is your name today?
sarah.  eddie, look. I have got troubles, and i think maybe you have got troubles. maybe it would be better if we just leave each other alone.
i got my things over at the hotel. I will bring them over later...  come here.
I am not sure... i do not know.
well, what do you want to know? and why?
where you been all day?
at school. it is thursday.
oh, i forgot.
you were asleep when i left. i did not want to wake you. did you go out?
yeah, i went out for a couple of hours.
you know, I have been living here for almost three years. now in three days it seems as if i know everybody. when i pass people on the street i want to stop and say, "listen, i got a fella."
thanks.
eddie, where do you go when you go out?
museums... art galleries... concerts.
well, i believe you when you say you go to school.
you want to go with me?
what, are you kidding? see that book?  I have been trying to get through that book ever since i first got here. i have not finished the first chapter.  did you read all them books?
mm hmm.
you got it all in your head?
when I am sober. they get a little mixed up when I am drunk. most of the time they are mixed up.
oh, stop talking about yourself like you are a lush or something. i do not like it.  maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
I am getting treatments right here.
I am hungry.
take your choice. I have got enough so we will not have to go out of the house till tuesday.
what did all this stuff cost you?
when you have got money, you will pay.
no, c'mon, i wanna know. i wanna keep score.
the bills are right here. you did not say what you wanted.
do not you ever cook anything?
eggs. how do you like them?
raw.
oh, cut my finger.
I have got something in my bag.
oh, it is not bad.
eddie, what is in that case?
have not you opened it?
no, why should i? it is yours.
it is a machine gun. this guy told me when i came to the big city I would have to have a machine gun, so i bought one.  where do you get the money? to pay for all this? i mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
from a rich old man who used to be my lover.
hello, charlie...  c'mon in...  that is my girl.
hello, eddie's girl...  i looked all over for you.
oh yeah? how did you find me?
i asked around.
do you want me to go?
no, stick around.  can i get you something? drink? coffee?
oh, i do not want to be no bother to nobody.
oh, do not play it small, charlie. it do not look good on you.
how do you want me to play it? I am broke.
so am i... sit down.  would you get us a couple of drinks?
you walked out on me like that. no goodbye, no nothing. like a thief in the dark. we were partners. we were more than partners.  he was like a... like --
a son.
yeah, yeah, like a son.  I have known this boy since he was sixteen. the first time i saw him, back in oakland, i said, "this is a talented boy. this is a smart boy."
talk to me, charlie.
i want you to come back on the road with me.
aah! I have got no stomach for that any more. I have had that kind of life.
what kind of life have you got here? scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
I will connect. I will get you your money back.
are you figuring on going back to ames to play minnesota fats again? is that what is on your mind?
never been out of it. I am going to beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
this boy's crazy. they wiped the floor with him. they beat his brains out and he wants to go back.  what for? to take another beating?
i told you you would get your money back.
he thinks i care about the money.  i care about you. do you care about me, eddie? we are together a long time, night and day. so how do you say goodbye?  you gimme the car and a hundred bucks. you think i care about the dough, the car? i care about you.  this boy is the greatest pool hustler you ever saw. a real high-class con man. he can charm anybody into anything. did he ever tell you how well we were doing on the road? we had everything: we ate good, we slept late, we had money to burn. whisky, dames...  excuse me...  I will tell you what -- take her along.
with what?
do not worry about it. I will raise the money.
oh yeah? where?
what is the difference where? I will raise it.  is it all right if i have another drink?
how much?!
my twenty-five per cent. approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
oh, you crumb. with that fifteen hundred i coulda beat him. that is all i needed, charlie.
aw, eddie.
c'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
what for? to play fats again?
yeah, to play fats again.
you wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. but if you wanna give it to minnesota fats... nothing doing. what do you say?
you still do not see it, do you, charlie? you are nothing but a small- time charlie. you would love to keep me hustling for you, huh? would not ya? i mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. you might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in oakland. six tables and a handbook on the side. is that when you say goodbye to me, charlie?
is that what you think?
yeah, that is what i think.
all right. that is what i want. poolroom with a little handbook on the side. getting old.
lay down and die by yourself. do not take me with you.
just like that?
yeah. just like that.
you going out?
yeah. for a little while.
what are you writing?
oh, it is a story. a story I am making up.
give it to me.
what is this supposed to mean?
give it back to me.
what is this supposed to mean: "we have a contract of depravity. all we have to do is pull the blinds down."
you told charlie to lay down and die. will you say that to me too?  what happens, eddie?
you will find yourself another rich old lover.
that is right! and I am sure you will help me.
give me a bottle of beer.
right.
huh?
it is open...  what will you have?
okay?
sit down.
what is the limit?
half and a dollar.
gimme ten bucks.
ten dollars.
make it twenty.
cut.
deal.
bourbon. j. t. s. brown.
two.
I am buyin'.
thought you only drank milk.
only when i work.
yeah? why?
i like it. it is good for you. besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. that is something you do not need -- an excuse for losing. how did you make out in the poker game?
i lost twenty bucks.
poker's not your game.
what is?
pool.
you being cute?
i do not think there is a pool player alive shoots better pool than i saw you shoot the other night at ames. you got talent.
so i got talent. so what beat me?
character.
yeah. sure, sure.
you are damned right I am sure. everybody's got talent. i got talent. you think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? you think they call minnesota fats the best in the country just 'cause he is got talent? nah. minnesota fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
i got drunk.
he drank as much whisky as you did.
maybe he knows how to drink.
you bet he knows how.  you think that is a talent too, huh? knowin' how to drink whisky? you think minnesota fats was born knowin' how to drink?
okay, okay... what do i do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? what do i do, go home?
that is your problem.
so i stay. stay until i hustle up enough to play fats again. maybe by that time I will develop myself some character.
maybe by that time you will die of old age. how much do you think you'll, uh, need?
a thousand.
no, three thousand at least. he will start you off at five hundred a game -- he will beat the pants off you. that is the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. he will beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. but he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. but i would not count on it.
how do you know? huh? when nobody knows that much?
see that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? well, that is mine. i like that car. but i get a new one every year because i make it my business to know what guys like you and minnesota fats are going to do. i made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
in that case, you owe me another drink.
eddie, is it all right if i get personal?
whaddya been so far?
eddie, you are a born loser.
what is that supposed to mean?
first time in ten years i ever saw minnesota fats hooked, really hooked. but you let him off.
i told you. i got drunk.
sure, you got drunk. that is the best excuse in the world for losing. no trouble losing when you got a good excuse. and winning! that can be heavy on your back too. like a monkey. you drop that load too when you got an excuse. all you got to do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. it is one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
thanks for the drink.
wait a minute. maybe i can help you.
to do what?
get the three thousand. play minnesota fats again.
why?
ten reasons. maybe fifteen. and also there is something in it for me.
oh yeah, i figured that. how much?
seventy-five per cent.
for who?
for me.
that is a -- that is a pretty big slice. who do you think you are, general motors?
how much you think you are worth these days? I am puttin' up the money, I am puttin' up the time. for that i get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
you think i can lose?
i never saw you do anything else.
you saw me beat minnesota fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
look, you wanna hustle pool, do not you? this game is not like football. nobody pays you for yardage. when you hustle you keep score real simple. the end of the game you count up your money. that is how you find out who is best. that is the only way.
why back me then? why not back yourself? go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. you know all the angles.
I am already rich. but i like action. that is one thing i think you are good for is action. besides, like i say... you got talent.
yeah, you already told me that. you cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
no, we do not talk. i do not make bad bets. seventy-five, twenty-five. that is it.
kiss off.
hey, wait.  what are you gonna do about the money?
there are places. I will scuffle around.
word's out on you, eddie. you walk in the wrong kind of place and they will eat you alive.
now, when did you adopt me?
i do not know when it was.
hi.
hi.
how much you playin' for?
a dollar on the five, two on the nine.
yeah, I will play you a couple. just for kicks.
okay, friend.
you quittin' too?
you are a pretty good player.
how much are you ahead?
couple of bucks.
i guess it is just you and me, huh?
yeah, i guess it is, boy. just you and me.
you wanna raise the bet? two on the five, five on the nine?
you know what, kid? i think maybe you are a hustler.
try me.
shoot.
okay.
you sure you do not want to quit, friend?
let's cut out the small stuff, huh? hundred dollar freeze-out. ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. and then we will see who quits.
okay, friend. you are on.
call it.
heads.
you better not miss, friend.
i do not rattle, kid. but just for that I am going to beat you flat.
you quittin', friend?
yeah, I am quittin'.
who is it?
me. it is eddie.
what happened?
i got beat up. they...  they broke my thumbs.
you can read it, if you want to.  you want to go out for a while? to a movie?
you wanna drink?
no. you?
what is it so hot in here for?
sarah, do you think I am a loser?
a loser?
yeah. i met this guy -- gordon, bert gordon. he said i was. born loser.
would he know?
he knows. a lot.
why did he tell you?
i do not know. I am not sure. he said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
what does he do, this bert gordon?
he is a gambler.
is he a winner?
well, he owns things.
is that what makes a winner?
well, what else does?
does it bother you? what he said?
yeah.  yeah. it bothers me a lot.  'cause, you see, twice, sarah -- once at ames with minnesota fats and then again at arthur's...  ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... now, why did i do it, sarah? why did i do it? i coulda beat that guy, i coulda beat him cold. he never woulda known. but i just had to show 'em, i just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it is great, when it is really great. you know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... i do not care, bricklaying can be great. if a guy knows. if he knows what he is doing and why, and if he can make it come off. i mean, when I am goin' -- when I am really goin' -- i feel like...  ...like a jockey must feel. he is sittin' on his horse, he is got all that speed and that power underneath him, he is comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'cause he is got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. it is a great feeling, boy, it is a real great feeling when you are right, and you know you are right. it is like all of a sudden i got oil in my arm. pool cue's part of me. you know, it is a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. it is a piece of wood -- it is got nerves in it. you feel the roll of those balls. you do not have to look. you just know. ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. and you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
you are not a loser, eddie. you are a winner. some men never get to feel that way about anything. i love you, eddie.
you know, someday, sarah, you are going to settle down. you are going to marry a college professor, and you are going to write a great book. maybe about me, huh? fast eddie felson, hustler.
i love you.
you need the words?
yes, i need them very much. and if you ever say them I will never let you take them back.
you glad?
yes, I am glad.
hello, eddie.
hi. how is business?
ahh, slow... why the open hand bridge? something wrong with your hand?
yeah. had a little accident. a place called arthur's.
oh. you seem to do all right that way.
I would say my game is about twenty per cent off. maybe more.
what happened? somebody step on your hands?
yeah. big creep. broke my thumbs.
man named turk baker?
you know everybody, do not you?
everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. it pays.
maybe you oughta give me lessons.
sign up.
where do i sign?
the first match i got in mind for you is in louisville, kentucky.
you name the place, boss. I will be there.
what happened to you anyway?
like i told ya. my thumbs.
no, i do not mean the thumbs. you already told me about the thumbs.
i been thinking.
thinking about what?
maybe I am not such a high-class piece of property right now. and a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? j. t. s. brown.
sherry.  very old, very dry.
two.  sherry?... nice joint. you look very pretty.
i feel pretty.
well, what is so funny?
your tie. i never saw you wear one before.
first time for everything.
what is it, eddie?
nothin'.  want another drink?
what do you want to tell me?
well, i, uh, I will be leaving town for a little while.
for how long?
oh, i do not know.
a week? a year?
more like a week. look, I will be back.
sure. let's go home.
no, i want to walk.
come here. come on, now.
do not you want to know where I am going?
no.  yes, i want to know what for. but i do not want to ask.
I am going to kentucky. to louisville. with a friend. try to make some money. i need it, the money. I will be leaving early in the morning.
leave now.
oh, grow up.
why should i?
sarah, I am going to kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of findley. now, i need the action and i need the money. i told you I would be back.
if you were going to come back you would not have taken me out tonight. you would not have bought this dress. you are hustling me, eddie. you have never stopped hustling me.
now, i never hustled you. even when i thought i was. you know it.
what do you want me to do? just sit here and wait? faithful little sarah. pull the shades down and sit. when you feel like coming back, you will come back. and you will love me. and then you will go away again. is that your idea of love?
i got no idea of love. and neither have you. i mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
I would know it, eddie. I would know. for god's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? i love you.
well, what is your idea of love? chains?
no.  i made you up, did not i, eddie? you were not real. i made you up, like everything else. there was no car crash, eddie. when i was five, i had polio. i was never an actress. the rich old man is my father. he walked out on us when i was seven. he sends me a check every month. that is how he buys his way out of my life. the men I have known... after they left, I would say they were not real, i made them up. but you, eddie. i wanted you to be real.
sarah packard... bert gordon.
miss packard. how do you do?
you sure you going to be comfortable enough there, miss... ah... ?
packard. sarah packard.
it always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. are you sure you do not want anything?
no, I am fine.
you, uh, you ever been to louisville during derby week, miss, ah, packard?
I have never been to louisville.
lots of action. lots of money.  lots of class. you will see some of the best-dressed and most beautiful women in the world at the races. knock your eye out.
james findley is a very rich man. grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
what? and he -- he hustles pool?
he is a gentleman. gentleman gambler. he gets his kicks playing with hustlers. he is got an old southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
how good is he?
i do not know. never saw him play. they say he is one of the best.
I am ready.
soon as i finish my coffee.
you must have a lot of confidence in me.
i don't. but i got confidence in findley.
what is that supposed to mean?
means i got confidence that he is a loser. all the way a loser. you happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner.  I am finished.
here, i got it.
no, no. when you play for me, i pick up all the tabs.
fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. he played it smart.
i played that game, bert. in my head i played it a thousand times.
play it again. learn something.  fats went in the john, see? washed his face, cleaned his fingernails, made his mind a blank, combed his hair, came back all ready to go.  you were through. you saw him, you saw how he looked. clean, all set to start all over again. hold tight and push hard. you know what you were doing? you were waitin' to get beat. flattened out on your butt, swimmin' around in glory. and whisky. probably deciding how you could lose.
what makes you know so much? how do you know what eddie was thinking?
i know. been there myself. we have all been there, have not we, miss packard?
does not your lighter work, mr. gordon?
oh, i forgot all about it.  how is the hands?
fine.
good. I would hate to think i was putting my money on a cripple.
hey, whaddya say something like that for?
it is all right, eddie. I am sure mr. gordon meant no offense. it was a figure of speech.
that is right, miss packard.
and a fact is a fact.
she is a smart girl, eddie.
you know, that is real sweet music in there. you can almost smell the action and the money. you know, i can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.
come on, let's go...
fifty-seven.
I will be up later.
oh, wait a minute, miss packard.
we are neighbors now. you can call me sarah.
i want to talk to you.
do we need words?
yeah, i think we do. we could try to cut each other up. but that would be bad for everybody. bad for me, bad for you. and worst of all, be bad for eddie.
you know what is good for him?
to win.
for whom and for what?
for what makes the world go round. for money, and for glory.
you did not answer my first question. for whom?
all right. today for me, tomorrow for himself.
no, there is no tomorrow. not with you. you own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
well, nobody has to sell.
you bastard.
listen, miss ladybird, you are here on a rain check and i know it. you are hanging on by your nails. you let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for eddie and you are a wreck on a railroad track. you are a horse that finished last. so do not make trouble, miss ladybird. live and let live. while you can.
I will make it up to you.
how?
you tell me.
where is bert?
he went off someplace.
well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty.  let's see... two hundred i won from the jockey last night. and today at the track... i got five hundred and forty bucks.  here, you hold it.
why?
just for luck.
hey, findley's here.
where?
over there by the bar.
are not you going to go over and talk to him?
nah. sit tight. he will be over here.
are you ready for another?
thank you.
no, no more for me.
well, hello. have not seen you in a long time.
findley.
glad to meet you.
and i you.  i think I have heard about you, mr. felson. you play pocket billiards, do not you?
now and then. why, do you?
a little, although I am afraid i generally lose.
so does eddie.
well, i win sometimes.
I will bet you do, mr. felson. I will just bet you do.
how much?
bert, i believe mr. felson's making a proposition.
could be.
well, mr. felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. we could play a few games of billiards.
when?
you are very direct, mr. felson.
that is right. when?
would you like to come out tonight?
what time?
I am having some people over for drinks right after the races. why do not you all come over? then about nine, ten of the clock we can play.
we will be there.
good, good.
if you do not mind i think I will stay at the hotel.
well, what is the matter?
I am a little tired.
what is the matter? what happened?
it is all right. she had a little too much to drink, that is all. forget it.  go upstairs and sleep it off.
you gentlemen care for a drink?
no, none for me. come on, let's play.
by all means.
i thought we came here to play pool.
i do not play pool, mr. felson. i play billiards. my house, my game. you do not have to play if you do not want to.
well, we won't.
c'mon, bert. let me play him.
how much?
oh, we will start small... a hundred dollars a game.
you ever played billiards before?
sure.
you hustlin' me?
I am sure mr. felson knows what he is doing. certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
deal the cards.
beautiful shot, felson. beautiful. you have played billiards before, mr. felson. ah, you gentlemen sure you do not care for a drink?
oh no, nothing for me.
how do we stand?
'bout even.
when do i raise the bet?
i do not know.
bert, if that is his best game, i can beat him.
level with me, eddie. you ever play billiards before?
what is the difference? you got a pool cue, balls on the table. all you got to do is get the feel of it.
like to raise the stakes, mr. felson?
okay?
how much?
oh, about five hundred.
do you really think you can beat him?
of course he thinks he can beat me, bert. he would not be playing me if he didn't. right, felson?
i did not ask him can he beat you. i already know he can beat you. i asked him will he? with eddie, that is two different things.
i can beat him.
all right. five hundred.
have you noticed, bert? this fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. it seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
it is possible.
I will beat him the next game.
how're the hands?
they are fine.
well, rack up your cue. we are leavin'.
that seems a shame. the night is young.
the night is two thousand dollars old.
hey, bert. wait a minute!
i said we are leavin'.
i can beat him, bert. now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. i did not think he did. but i can outplay him. i can beat him.
i do not believe you, eddie. i think you are still a loser.
all right, then. I will play him with my own money.
there it is. I am broke.
ah, that is unfortunate, mr. felson.
for who, mr. findley? ...bert, he only beat me by one point. now, you can not get off me now.
please do not get off me now.
i know when to quit. you don't. win or lose, you do not know when to quit.
what do you want me to do, huh? what do you want me to do? just say it and you got it but please do not get off me now.
go on back to the hotel.
please, eddie, do not beg him.
would you go on back to the hotel? take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
does not all of this come through to you, eddie? does not any of this mean anything to you? that man, this place, the people. they wear masks, eddie. and underneath the masks they are perverted, twisted, crippled.
shut up.
do not wear a mask, eddie. you do not have to.  that is turk, eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. only he is not going to break your thumbs. he will break your heart, your guts. and for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'cause of what you have and he hasn't.
would you get off my back, sarah? once and for all, will you get out, will you get off my back?!
will you take a check, bert?
cash.
how much do i owe you?
twelve thousand.
here.  been an interestin' evening.
yeah, sure has.
charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please.  I would show you to the door, but i...
oh yeah, yeah. you are tired.  and beat.
yeah. you must come again.
yeah. sure.
i wanna walk.
it is a long walk.
i got time, bert.
you want me to tell her for you?
tell her what?
you gotta be hard, eddie.
in a little while. that is what you want, is not it?
it is what eddie wants. he, uh, told me to give you some money.
put it on the bed. that is the way it is done, is not it?
that is the way it is done.
and the way you are looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you have just beaten? as if you would just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
all i want's the money.
sure, sure, just the money, and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart. you are a roman, bert. you have to win them all.
i came to play pool, fats.
that is good, eddie. for how much?
you name it.
thousand dollars a game.
let's make it three thousand dollars a game, fats. c'mon, three thousand dollars. that is my bankroll, my life's savings.  what is the matter, fats? all you got to do is beat me the first game and I am on my way back to oakland.
let's go.
shoot pool, fast eddie.
I am shootin' pool, fats. when i miss you can shoot.
i quit, eddie. i can not beat you. willie, give him the stakes.  you got yourself a pool player.
preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
eddie?...  you owe me money!
and just how do you figure that, bert? what do you figure i owe you?
half.
in louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
well, here it is half.
what if i do not pay ya, bert?
you do not pay me? you going to get your thumbs broken.  and your fingers. and if i want them to, your right arm in three or four places.
so you figure you are still my manager, huh?
I am a businessman, kid.
well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
yeah, we are going to make a lotta money together, from now on.
fifty per cent?
no, it do not have to be fifty. it can be thirty... twenty-five.
we really stuck the knife in her, did not we, bert?
aaaahhhh!
boy, we really gave it to her good.
if it did not happen in louisville, it would happened someplace else. if it did not happen now, it would happen six months from now. that is the kinda dame she was.
and we twisted it, did not we, bert? course, maybe that does not stick in your throat cause you spit it out just like you spit out everything else. but it sticks in mine. i loved her, bert. i traded her in on a pool game. but that would not mean anything to you. because who did you ever care about? just win, win, you said, win, that is the important thing. you do not know what winnin' is, bert. you are a loser. 'cause you are dead inside, and you can not live unless you make everything else dead around ya.
...you shoot a great game of pool.
so do you, fast eddie.
