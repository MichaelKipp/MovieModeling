which one is it?
it's the last house on the left. she lives downstairs.
what're you gonna do?
maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
so what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
cool it, andy.
i didn't mean it the way it sounded...
i appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
okay, we won't.  we'll just have fun, all agreed?
dammit shelly!  why do you always have to be such an asshole!
i beg your pardon, i'm not an asshole.  i'm an actor.
same thing.
look shelly, you're my roommate and i like you... most of the time.  but you gotta stop doing these things.  now, i set this date up for you, didn't i?  so don't embarrass me.  when you meet this woman, just relax and be yourself.
would you be yourself...  ...if you looked this this?
what are they saying?
i don't know.  i flunked spanish.
hi.
you're shelly?
i'm sorry.
what d'ya got in there?
my whole world.
in that little thing?
stick around and you'll see.
what are we gonna do?
destroy the evidence, pronto!
destroy the evidence?  no, man!
yes, man!
breakfast?
no way.  we're pregnant.  remember?
faster!  eat faster!
why don't you help us?
uh... i guess i'm just not hungry.
i'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  now i gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  i don't think i can make it, man!
chuck... look.
i'm a slow eater.
i love you, man!
that scarecrow?  can't you tell how weird his is just by looking at him.
come on, shelly.  who else is gonna give him a lift?
not us!  he's really creepy.
my name is abel.  and i am my brother's keeper.
where are you going?
going?  how do you mean?
i mean, is there any place in particular where we can drop you off?
drop me off?  how do you mean?
what is that?
i found this today.  there were other pieces of the body lying there, but i believe "he" wanted me to have this...
that's an eyeball!  oh, god!
"he" wanted me to warn you.  look at this, all of you!
come on down!
you go ahead...
derek... stop.
why?
you know what i've been through. don't ever scare me like that.
i'm sorry.  i just wanted to surprise you.  what can i say?
you can say... "hello, how are you?"... for starters.
hello.  how are you?
you haven't changed a bit.  always so sure of yourself.  even when we were kids, when you wanted something, nothing could stop you.
is that so bad?
i don't know.
you're irresistible.  i lose control.
just slow down.  let me get to know you again.  let me get to know this place again.
okay.  there's a whole weekend ahead of us.  there's time.
this door was open just a minute ago, wasn't it?
what?
nothing.
it's dark down there.
that's the way it is, man. cellars are dark.
and hell is hot, but i ain't goin' down there either.
what's this?
your bed.
a hammock?
have you ever made love in a hammock?
look what i found.  remember these?
did you stay here last night?
no.  i got here just before you did.
somebody was in here.
goldilocks and the three bears?
i'm serious.  doesn't this look a little strange to you?
no more... i can't!
yes, you can.  come on, shelly!
what was that?
where's shelly?
shelly!  where are you?!
are you all right, shelly?
let's spread out and check all the rooms.  outside, too.  you stay with me.
no.  i can look around by myself. i'll take the upstairs.
is... is everything all right?
everything's gonna be fine.
excuse me, but i believe that's mine...
please... be cool.
may be please have the wallet.
are they following us?
yes.
gulp!
see anything?
just a dirty window.  next time, i'll know how to handle a situation like that.  let's just hope that "next time" isn't too soon.
stop worrying.  i don't think they'll bother to come after us.
i don't see anything.
keep looking.
got any good ideas?
maybe.
this is no time to celebrate!
just keep your eyes on the road.
what're you doing?
no time to explain.  just listen. when i yell "stop," you jam on the brakes as hard as you can.  okay?
you're the boss.
bullseye!
stop the car!  now!!
this has been on helluva beginning to a quiet weekend in the country.
look at it this way... things can only get better... right?
maybe we should do some exercise.
this is all the exercise i need...
we had a slight misunderstanding with that motorcycle gang...  ... but shelly made them see the error of their ways.
it was nothing.
we're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
a few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
this is too painful to look at.
why don't we drive over to the cove and watch the sunset.  it'll mellow you out.
why don't we go take a swim?
i don't know...
we'd be all alone.  we could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
sounds disgusting.  let's go.
what're you doing?
we haven't looked in the barn, yet.  let's take a look.
not now.  i'm cold.
how about a roll in the hay?
you can play with yourself, 'cause i'm going in the house.
who brought up this bright idea?
we were looking for something to keep our hands busy.  it was either this or an orgy.  vera chose this.  what're ya gonna do?
how about you and i whacking a couple of balls around?
if you insist.
you know, i'm not sure i could live anywhere else.  the nights are always so peaceful and quiet.
it's deceiving.
what do you mean?
the quiet can fool you.  it fooled me.  you can never be sure of what's out there.
why did you come back here?
... to prove something to myself... to prove i'm stronger than i think i am.
and, what about us?
i'm here with you.  can't that be enough for now?
i don't know.  i don't see you for months on end, and when i do, you put this wall between us.  how do i break through?
i'm trying.  i'm really trying.
what happened that night?
you promised you'd never ask me.
after you left me that night, i didn't see you or talk to you again for a year.  no one would tell me anything.  all i know is what the police told me.  we have nowhere to go unless you let me in.  what happened?
... one thousand twelve... one thousand thirteen... one thousand fourteen... what's the world's record for this?
according to the guinness book, you passed the world's record several whacks ago.
i did?!  i broke the world's record.
you're all just jealous.
actually, i have no idea what the world's record is.  i was just kidding.
vera... you and i have had a chance to really get to know one another today.  i like you... very much.  i was thinking that maybe.
don't say any more.
how do we do it?
first we take off our clothes, then you get on top of me or i get on top of you...
i know how to do it.  i mean, how do we do it in the hammock?
think you can figure it out?
i'll think of something.
when you dropped me off at the house, it was very late.  my parents were waiting up for me. as soon as i got in the door, they starting yelling and cursing at me.  i was so upset... i told them i slept with you.  my mothers slapped me.  that was the first time she'd ever hit me.  i couldn't believe it.  i ran out of the house and into the woods as fast and as far as i could run. i was crying.  they had destroyed the most beautiful night of my life and i wanted to punish them for that.  i decided to hide out all night.  they'd be so worried that they'd be sorry for what they did to me.  the woods were cold and damp from the rain.  i found a dry spot under a rotted oak tree and i guess i fell asleep.  all i can remember next is being startled out of sleep by the sound of footsteps.  i thought it was my father so i hid behind the tree. but the footsteps just stopped. the woods were dark.  i couldn't see anything.  i heard a cracking noise behind me.  i turned around and... and... oh, god... there was this hideous looking man.  so grotesque he was almost inhuman.  he had a knife and he started to slash away at me, again and again.  i was so hysterical and i don't know how i was able to get away.  i ran and ran, but he kept coming.  he was big but so fast.  he caught me and pulled me down to the ground and he... he... ripped my blouse off. i was screaming, but who could hear me?  then... oh, god... he dragged me by the hair along the ground.  i was kicking and yelling.  he dragged me deeper and deeper into the woods.  oh, please... please...
it's all right, you're all right. i'm with you.
you've just learned a valuable lesson.  a beautiful girl like you should never go out in the dark alone.
damn you, shelly!
why do you do these stupid things?!
i have to.
you don't "have to."
i just want you to like me.
i do like you.  but not when you act like a jerk.
being a jerk is better than being nothing.
i never said you were "nothing".
you don't to say it.  i can tell.
you're wrong.
that was the best yet.  was it you... me... or the hammock?
i vote for me.
i vote for the hammock.
what're you doin'?
i think it's called "a shower". you might try it sometime.
you're too clean for me.
hey deb... can you hear me?
barely.
i'm going downstairs to get a beer. you want one?
what?
do you want a beer or not?
sure.
could we move a little faster?
sure, just watch where you're going.
you know him?
sort of.
i can't find the bong anywhere. can't you remember where you dropped it?
i can't even remember what day it is, man.
it's friday the 13th.
what's the matter?!
nothin'.  i was just foolin' around.
don't do that to me!
here.  go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
will you come with me?
be a man, man.
