this is an important mission, sgt. whitman. i hope you realize that.
oh -- you don't wanna know what i think. topside, now.
sgt. whitman!! sgt. whitman!! may i have a word??
what is it?
in private, if you don't mind...
you are a catholic??
amongst other things, yes -- but that's hardly the point.
here. you'll need one of these.
i abhor violence.  sergeant whitman, i hope you don't think me mad --
three days too late for that one, "professor."
you're wasting our time: there's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
ruins. not rocks. the remains of trondham abbey. built on an intersection of ley lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
what a load of crap. hell, a week ago i hadn't even heard the word parabnormal --
"paranormal"  but -- you read the transmission.
half transmission. nonsense -- german ghost stories!
i have seen ghosts, whitman.
oh, i'll bet you have.
the freak in the gas mask --
karl ruprecht kroenen, one of the reich's top scientists. head of the thule occult society.
if he's here, this is worse than i thought.
air and sea backup. what's closest?
it's almost over!!
no. it's not.
cordon off the area. something came through.
from where??!!
do you believe in hell?
there is a place -- a dark place where evil slumbers and awaits to return. from there it infects our dreams. our thoughts. grigory gave us a glance tonight --
grigory -- that's russian, right?  thought they were on our side...
grigory yefimovich rasputin --
c'mon -- rasputin??
spiritual advisor to the romanovs.  in 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
that makes him more than a hundred --
what the hell was that? an ape?
no. it was red. bright red.
it's got a big stone -- in its hand --
i think that is its hand.
hello, i'm --
-- late. five minutes late.
yes, i --
-- section fifty-one. step back.
pardon?
two steps back, please.
they took his name from this little inscription that was stuck on his tank.
icthyo sapiens, april 14, 1865.
the day abraham lincoln died. hence "abe" sapien.
how does he know so much about me?
abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.  "unique." that's a word you'll hear quite a bit around here.
where am i -- exactly, sir?
as you entered the lobby there was an inscription --
on the desk, yes. in latin.
impressive. do you remember what it said?
"in absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
"in the absence of light, darkness prevails." for there are things that go bump in the night, agent myers.  we are the ones who bump back.
1958, the occult war finally ends when adolf hitler dies.
1945, you mean. hitler died in '45.
did he, now?
they're not speaking. professor broom had him grounded.
grounded? who's grounded?
okay. you saw the fish man, right?
he gets fed six times a day. he's got a thing for cats. you'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. he never goes out unsupervised --
who?!
you're kidding --
those comics -- they never got the eyes right.
oh, jesus!! hellboy -- ?? is real --
yup. sixty years old by our count. but he doesn't age like we do -- think dog years: he's barely out of his teens.
who's the squirt?
agent myers is your new liaison.
got tired of me?
nah. i'll be around, red, just back in the field.
i don't want him.
manning says i'm too soft on you --  the candy. give him the candy.
oh. uh. hello. i -- i have these. for you.
father's back?  still angry?
well, you did break out --
i wanted to see her.  it's nobody's business.
it is. you got yourself on tv again.
"myers", huh? you have a first name??
try not to stare. he hates when people stare.
uh-oh -- john.  staring at what?
his horns. he files 'em. to "fit in."
his what??!!
whatcha looking at, john??
oh-n-no -- i --
hey, hey, hey. they're playing our song.
we're on the move.
c'mon, champ! happy halloween!!! you're taking me for a walk!
look at them ugly suckers, blue. one sheet of glass between them and us.
story of my life.
i break it, they see us, happy halloween. no more hiding.  outside. i could be outside --
you mean, outside... with her.
don't get psychic with me.
nothing psychic about it. you're easy.
how am i ever gonna get a girl?? i drive around in a garbage truck
liz left us, red. take the hint.
we don't take hints.
at nineteen hundred hours an alarm tripped. b&e. robbery. six guards dead --
hold on -- hold on -- i thought we checked this place. fakes, and reproductions.
a 16th century statue was destroyed. saint dionysius the aeropagite.
who wards off demons.
smuggled into this country by an overzealous curator. the statue, however, was hollow --
reliquary --
a prison. the vatican deemed its contents dangerous enough to include it on the list of avignon. of which we hold a copy.
would'ya look at this babies? made 'em myself. holy water, silver shavings, white oak: the works.
behind this door. a dark entity -- evil, ancient and hungry.
hey. stinky. kitchen's closed.  whatcha havin'? six library guards, raw? plus belts and boots? man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
red, i found something --
that's all for you, sammy.
red -- you need to hear the rest of the information --
nah -- he's taken care of.
no, listen this: sammael, the desolate one, lord of the shadows, son of nergal --
hound of resurrection --
see? i don't like that --
-- hound of resurrection?
harbinger of pestilence, seed of destruction --
skip to the end, willya?  how do i kill it -- ?
it doesn't say --
that voice --
i sang the first lullaby you ever heard, my child. i ushered you into this world.  i alone know your true calling, your true name.
don't tell me, it's zeppo.
helping you -- i just --
no one ever helps me. it's my job.
myers??? how's your arm?
my arm is fine. where are you??
i just fried stinky. tell father i'll be home. he shouldn't wait up.
wait -- wait -- you can't go anywhere -- i gotta go with you --
no, no, no, it's fine: i do my job, i take a break.
no. stop. don't do this -- listen to me -- tell me where you are --
myers?
yes?
goodbye.
every time the media get a look at him, they come to me. i'm running out of lies, trevor.
i thought you liked being on tv.
i do.  how many escapes?  this year alone: five!
tom -- he's our guest, not a prisoner.
your "guest" happens to be six foot five, bright red, and is government funded.
he's just going through a phase --
these freaks, trevor, they give me the creeps. and i'm not the only one. you're up for review. you and your petting zoo.
i know where to find him. i'll get him back.
i need to touch it to "see"...
see what??
the past, the future, whatever this object holds.
is he serious??
don't worry about fingerprints. i never had any.
they were over here, professor.
oooh!! who was here? nixon? houdini? you mind sharing your mystic insights?
you better have that looked at.
just a scratch.  i wanted to see you.
we miss you at the bureau. abe's crazier every day. and father's still mad at me --  come back, liz. come back. i --
no. not this time, h.b. it's been months since i've had an episode. and you know what? i'm learning to control it.
sir, may i go first??
not so fast. he barely knows him --
goodnight, then.
goodnight.
what took you so long?
c'mon, time to go home. tape you up.
what are you, a boy scout?
no. i never was.
could've fooled me. go away.
c'mon, champ. you look a little woozy, there.
this -- ? this is nothing. you know what'll kill me?  her.
you were burned by some organic acid.
i'm lucky that way.
son. about rasputin --
don't worry. i'll get him soon enough --
listen to me. this time is different. there's more at stake than ever before.
how hard can it be? i punched the crap out of that thing that he sent -- ouch!!
i worry about you.
me?? c'mon --
well, i won't be around forever, you know?
oh, stop that --  damn! be careful, there --
red. how long was it latched onto you?
i dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
you want me to hold him down?
that's right, stud, hold me down.
don't look! turn around.
is it bad?
touched you five seconds. laid three eggs.
didn't even buy me a drink.
down there. did you ever loose track of him?
well, let's see -- there was that moment, when i had a train on top of my head --
i'm in way over my head, i know that much.
you're doing fine.
and as a father, i worry about him.  in medieval stories, agent myers, there's often a young knight, inexperienced but pure of heart...
oh, please. i'm not "pure of heart."
how many buildings does she have to burn? she belongs here!
that's not how she feels. she may never feel it.
it's her choice --  she's human --
oh, as opposed to -- ?
mmmh -- "pamcakes." we're going out --
professor, that girl you were talking about --
hey. you: think twice --
i think i can help -- talk to her -- i can bring her back.
what landed you this job, pushing "pamcakes"? punctuality? what was your area of expertise?
what was that??
hostage negotiations.
liz -- can i call you liz? it's a beautiful name --
60% of the women in this world are named "liz".
it's still impressive by my standards: my name's john.
dr. broom asked me to invite you back to the bureau. no special precautions, no security escorts. you and me in a taxi. like regular folks.
doesn't sounds like him.
miss sherman, he's asking you back, but it's entirely your choice.
remind me why i keep doing this.
rotten eggs and the safety of mankind.
oh, right --
but not everyone was so lucky.  two agents died today. clay probably won't survive the night. you're reckless.
i knew those men better than you did --
ah, i see. that makes it all alright then.
no, it doesn't make it right, but i stopped that creature, didn't i?
that's what you do. that's why we need you. you have an insight.  you know monsters.
what are you trying to say?
in the end, after you've killed and captured every freak out there -- there's still one left: you.
i wish i could be more gracious but --
where do you --
shh! just a second.
myers, you're a talker. what's a good word -- a solid word for "need" --
"need" is a good, solid word.
nah, sounds too "needy."
start in, you got nachos coming.
um... liz -- i -- there's something i'd like you to -- something i need you to hear.
well. is it long?? i'm going out, but --
out? out out?
for a cup of coffee, but go ahead, read.
you're going alone?
no. myers is taking me.
hey, your chili's getting cold --
not hungry.
it's nothing. just a list -- it's not finished --
oh, okay then. maybe later then.
anything else you --
not from you.
well good n-
good night.
i admire him. he's a force of nature.
he's just pushy.
no... he's determined. unstoppable --
cocky.
strong.
a brute.
my uncle used to say... we like people for their qualities but love them for their defects.
he -- loves you.
i know.
what about you?
don't know. really. i grew up with him.  i've missed him too, but now, every time i see him, i get confused. hardly a day goes by he's not in my mind. even now, i feel he's here --
it's freezing, isn't it?
coffee's warming me up.
hi.
i've changed my mind. i'll come to moscow. if you -- are still going --
but i understand what you don't like about me. i do. what i am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
red, i --
listen. i'm not like myers. he makes you feel like you belong. and -- that's good. it really is. i -- wish i could do something about this --  but i can't.  i can promise you only two things... one: i'll always look this good. two: i won't give up on you. ever.
i like that...
good.
"one falls, two shall arise." so: you pop one, two come out. you kill two, you get four. you kill four, you're in trouble. we have to nail 'em all at once. and the eggs.
when we do: no mumbo-jumbo. double- core vulcan-65 grenades.
we've installed a very handy timer. set it, walk away. cable pulls the safety pins, k-boom! easy to clean, easy to use...
those things never work. never.
each of us gets a belt.
i won't take 'em. they never work.
okay, someone's expecting us. turn on your locators -- anyone sees anything...
marco...
...polo.
are you sure about this?
on a scale of one to ten: two. but --  -- she'll take care of you, myers. she's a tough one.
we should go back -- you -- you could tear that door apart --
don't move. we --
-- should go back. now!
no. don't --
i'm in charge. we go back!
you'd better stay here. i'll find a way out. we'll come back for you.
you call that thing a cigar??
yup.
you never, ever light a cigar that way.
thank you.
my job.
but it's not true, is it?
what -- ?
that you feel that way about me.
you want to know -- now -- ? here? red, white, whatever -- guys are all the same.
hit me.
what?
she's dead.
noooo! noooo!!!
names hold the power and nature of things. mine for example. rasputin: "the crossroads."  and crossroads i have become.  your true name: anung-un-rama. repeat it. become the key.
anung-un-rama...
you will never fulfill your destiny. you will never understand the power inside you.
i can live with that.
keep her safe. no matter what. i'll deal with whatever's back there.
alone?
how big can it be?
this is an important mission, sgt. whitman. i hope you realize that.
oh -- you don't wanna know what i think. topside, now.
sgt. whitman!! sgt. whitman!! may i have a word??
