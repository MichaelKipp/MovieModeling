we'll try again.
no way. i've got to get out now.
hello, doc.
hi.
you okay?
i'm a lot better off than i was an hour ago.
you want to drive?
my license expired, let's get out of here.
sure...
i'm sorry i was late... i got my hair done... the girl was slow.
it looks fine.
feel good?
yeah.
where do you want to go?
i want to take a walk.
it doesn't look like that.
what do you mean? you've never been there.
i've been there every day for the last four years.
what's beynon got set up?
small town, small bank, big money.
where did you get those?
i've been doing my homework.
just like old times?
better than old times.
i hope so. i am not looking forward to another stretch.
i made a mistake. i'll never make another one.
where did you get them developed?
assumed name... houston.
good.
half a million.
that beynon's got a long arm.
what do you want for dinner?
whisky and a peach.
how does it taste?
just the way i remembered.
you been okay?
pretty good... made a quick trip to oregon, saw my brother and the kids. figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
how's estelle?
fatter... some things never change.
boring.
nothing's been boring since you found me.
that's not all of it.
no. it's been a long time.
you go out much?
after four years and now the question comes up.
couldn't handle it then. now i can.
i'm still here, doc.
i guess i'm kind of...
it's all right.
it's just been a while.
we've got time. we've got a lot of time. i can help you.
wait... give me a minute.
sure.
i'll be okay.
listen, i'm just as nervous as you are.
really?
really.
how was it?
better than i remembered.
i was going to fix you breakfast.
you were asleep.
i bought you a lot of new things.
yeah, well, i think i'll stick with what i've got.
suit yourself.
$250,000 right off the top.
is he straight?
you got the parole, didn't you?
thanks again.  i 'm glad you waited.
i couldn't have... much longer.
yeah... i know.
but i got you out. didn't i, doc. i did it. i got you out.
why are you laughing?
i laugh when i feel happy. sometimes just thinking of you made me laugh. i had a lot of that. and other times that wasn't enough. i had a lot of that too. i know you find it hard to believe, i'm happy just loving you.
that doesn't hurt.
but sometimes i cried a lot too.
i didn't. i just waited.
want to cry now?
you gotta be kidding.
not at all, just a pleasant way to have lunch.
all it takes is a long arm.
hard to judge how these things happen. the parole board almost never reverses their decisions.
i guess it was because i was a model prisoner.
this is the only time you and i meet in public. any business with me, handle it with him...
you're back with your own people now. got you some professionals.
i get my own help.
you run the job, but i run the show. you got two weeks to set it up.
what about them?
they're mine. the one with the moustache is my brother. they stay out of it. we stay clean.
rudy butler, frank jackson...
i heard about you. you work with miller.
you're out of touch. cops blew him up.
where?
chicago.
you were with him?
yeah. i got out.
what about you?
sure,  you're working on the passports...  ... and visas?
they will be ready. you guys do your job.
i'll take care of my end.
stay clean.
... bank president, three tellers and one guard...
usually on the right side as you go in.
nail him first, be careful he doesn't panic and want to shoot somebody. local police have one car, a rover, shouldn't be in the vicinity at the time we hit unless it's answering an emergency call... if the cop car shows up remember it doesn't have any automatic weapons. only a shotgun braced on the dashboard. get into a tight spot, you'll be out of range at forty yards. then they're down to their side guns.
for exits off main street.
should be light traffic that time of day... the bank guard carries a .38. these will stop an m.2 at fifty yards.
just in case someone gets a shot off.
i worked ten years without one, i don't need one now.
suit yourself.
okay. how many bank exits?
two.
what about the vault?
chambers - reilly. time lock opens 20 minutes before they start doing business...
wire pull over?
one-inch stuff on a three-number combination.
i'm good at that.
i 'm handling the fine stuff. you're back up all the way...
whatever you need.
keep going over these. i don't want anybody getting lost.
if we are clean gollie will take us over at nogales. if we are hot we'll have to try laughlin at el paso.
i'll hang on to these. we don't need them till we get to gollie«s. okay. any questions?
aren't we going a little hard?
what do you have in mind?
it's just a walk-in bank. you don't have to be dillinger for this one.
dillinger got killed.
you know how i feel?
my mind's not on guessing games.
promise you won't laugh.
if it's funny i'm going to laugh.
i feel like the night before the first day of school.
that bad?
it will be such a relief not to have to think about it any more.
waiting's hard. you never learn how.
you know i've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
at least you were outside.
it doesn!t make much difference where you are, if you're waiting, doc.
bullshit.
i mean it.
i know you do. but it is different.  it's different.  we'll be all right tomorrow.
we are always going to be all right tomorrow. i'd like to be all right a few todays.
we're going to have a lot of those,  we're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
... and live happily ever after.
what about the bank?
jackson panicked and nailed the guard.
doc...
i see it...
they checked in.
call the ranch, tell beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
why?
there are three men dead.
so what. i've got to give him his money. that was our end of the deal.
he might be ready to chop us up.
do it my way.
tell me about beynon's ranch.
i've never "been there... when we met it was in his office.
do you trust him?
i just figure the percentages. he wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
let's send his cut back -- just keep going.
if we make a mistake., he'll burn us. you make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
i don't want to go there.
do it my way.
hello, mccoy.
beynon.
news said two persons killed.
three... rudy got ambitious.
and you got him...
that's right.
what about your wife?
what about her?  let's c ut up the money, i want to get north.
you hired jackson and rudy., not me.
they may nail me into this now, mccoy.
that's your problem.
you know, you and i may be two of a kind.
no way. i always do my own work.
i'm in a hurry.
you still don't get the picture do you? i've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.
no applause!
a simple reason, mccoy. the obvious reason. to rob a bank.
i knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when i was 8.
what do you add up to here?
one. the radio's rappin' about $750^000. we only got a half a million.
a little more was taken out before.  my brother's a director of that bank, mr. mccoy... i had a few pressing debts.
so we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.
the obvious.  but we are both not interested in that right now.
no.  my old lady must have made a lot of promises.
close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings i pulled.
i bet.
don't think too badly of her... after all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.
get it over with...
why didn't you tell me?
there wasn't any way to explain it.
yeah.
you sent me to him.
when i got out, why didn't you tell me where it was?
what the hell do you want? mary tyler moore?
who's she?
she's on tv.
if you don't start telling the truth...
what do we do?
we keep going.
what's the damage?
collar bone is broken. no infection yet... the bandages should be changed twice a day.
i got a nurse in mind.
the glucose will begin working in half an hour. you'll feel better then...
the three of us are going to do some traveling. we're going to take your car to el paso.
that's not possible. we can't leave here... we've got all this.
is it possible, mrs. clinton?
just... tell us what you want.
what kind of car do you have, harold?
a ford... we have a ford.
that's good. that's very good. now harold, you go out and gas up the ford, check the oil and tires, we don't want any problems on the road. one more thing... if anybody but you comes back...
you do what he says, harold.
after you come back i'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... you have to call another vet about the animals. you tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. they got to be looked after...
that's right.
me, too. got twenty-four days of furlough and i'm goin' home.
where's home?
utah, the bee-hive state. i'm from orem, right near salt lake ... say, you wouldn't happen to be a mormon, would you?
no, i'm not.
me, neither. there's about twelve people in the state that aren't mormons and i'm one of them.
that certainly makes you kind of special...
yeah... i guess it does.
you wouldn't be taking the train to salt lake, would you?
no, i'm afraid not.
i never have any luck.
stands and pauses for a moment.
i really hope you have a nice trip.
thanks. i hope yours is okay, too.
a man helped me open it...
and switched keys.
he must have.
it isn't another boyfriend, is it?
how long ago.
fifteen minutes.
sure?
there better be a guy with the
you bastard...
i don't think you have to worry much about harold. he won't do anything.
that right?
you can trust him...
how long have you been married?
two years.
can he trust you?
that's what matters, isn't it?
something ought to loosen him up ... how comes we're going to el paso, rudy?
i just want to find a suitcase.
your kind of mistakes are going to land me back in huntsville.
i wouldn't worry doc. i can always get you out... i'll screw every prison official in texas if i have to.
texas is a big state.
i can handle it.
i'll bet you can.
you'd do the same for me, wouldn't you, doc?  if i was caught, wouldn't you?
when we had trouble before it was different.
you don't like the way things are, i don't like the way things
what do you want to do?
maybe we should split up... i'll cut the money with you.
do you mean that?
i mean it.
we'll grab a room for tonight then you go out tomorrow and buy yourself some new clothes, pick some up for me... grab some food now, paper bag it, we eat in the room.
you've got all the answers. what about when they find the body on the train?
when they find it, they find it.
you've got it all figured.
no... there's a couple of things i'm still working on.
like what?
there may be a hunting party.
why, there's nothing on the news?
i didn't mean police.
what?
if beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe beynon's boys will be waiting for us in el paso.
you're full of ifs.
i think you liked it with him.
maybe. at least i got to him.  where do we go from here?
el paso.
that would be the first time.
when are you going to learn?
i did i killed a man.
from now on you just shut up and do as you're told.
if i hadn't killed beynon., you would have.
you can't trust anything these days.
i'll tell you something, doc. one day you're going to have to trust somebody...
i trust...  want to see what i trust... in god we trust...  the word's on every bill!!!
you keep it up and it won't matter how far we get away, because it's going to be all over between you and me. do you understand that? there won't be anything left.
can i help you?
sure can. i'd like an invicta 12-gauge pump with the twenty-inch barrel.
all right. shells?
two boxes of double-ought buck.
gonna knock down a wall?
might try that.
only one car.
let's do it.
where are you going?
el paso.
how much?
twenty eight hundred.
are you hungry?
not now.
i've got to stop.
i'll tell you when.
okay?
i think so... i don't know.
no scars?
no scars.
do what i tell you, it's not a game.
it's all a game, don't bother me.
we better stick here till tonight.
yeah.
we're going to make it.
sure...
i want to say something.
i don't want to hear it.
listen to me. it's hard enough.
look, what you said yesterday... i guess that was right. it isn't worth anything if we don't make it together.
i don't think we can any more... if we ever get out of here, maybe i should take off...
we got this far.
we've come a lot of miles. but we're not close to anything.
i guess you're right.
i always thought jails make people hard. not you. you're just not tough enough to forget about beynon. i chose you, not him.
either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. we got to go one way or another.
no more about beynon.
whatever happens it's over.
sounds good.
you want to try with me?
things can't get much worse can they?
i don't see how.
okay.
you and me.
can we make it?
we get to mexico, we can have a life.
that's all i want... it's the only thing i have ever wanted.
how's mama and the kids?
growing -- all of them - every day.  318, you'll be the only ones on the floor.
my lady'11 come in in about five minutes. have some food sent up in half an hour.
just sandwiches...
right.
when she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
he took the day off.
then you do it.
can't leave the desk.
we've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
great. i'm going to sleep twelve hours.
ten. laughlin's going to take us across at four a.m.
oh, jesus... how?
jeep. there's a dry river bed fifteen miles east. he takes us to the mexican side, drops us off at the airfield by breakfast... we've got a 9 o'clock flight.
i'll be ready.
yeah.
what's wrong?
i don't know.
get in the shower. you'll feel okay.
whatever you say.
what is it?
laughlin. he's always got his family around... that wife and kid of his have to stand by his side to make sure he stays off the juice and horses.
so what?
if they are not here, he must have sent them away.
you're crazy.
get your clothes on, move your butt.
come on, come on.
who was it?
just get your clothes on...
drive.
suit yourself.
how was that?
just fine.
where we go in1?
mexico. i'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
why not?
you okay?
where do we go from here?
i don't know, airport i guess.
they will have our description before we can get a plane.
yeah.
i guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
i kinda doubt it.
three years ago i dynamited some fish at the reservoir.
oh my god.
that little job cost me a hundred dollars... didn't even get to keep the fish.
let's just get to the border.
sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'bout an hour. quiet crossing that is.
which way?
juarez - chihuahua city road.
don't you want to go to the airport?
not now.
how long before this car's hot?
pull over.
listen... how much money did you make this year?
what's it to you?
come on. how much?
'bout five thousand.
how about if i buy your car for ten grand?
you serious?
sure am.
and i keep my mouth shut?
that's what i want.
i don't report the car and i don't know either of you?
you got it.
how about twenty thousand?
you're going to have to walk back to the border.
don't worry about me, i'll grab a cab... i can afford it, you know.
hope you get to where you're going.
thanks. hope you do too.
by the way, you're getting a hell of a car there, mister.
well, i paid a hell of a price. now for god's sake keep your mouth shut.
wish you hadn't said that. when slim canfield's lips are sealed, they're sealed.
go with god.
one thing though... how do i explain this to my wife?
tell her you robbed a bank...
are we going to make it?
hell, i don't know... but we sure gave it a run.
whatever happens... we're going all the way.
yeah, why not? we're the good guys.
i guess we are.
what now?
we walk.
