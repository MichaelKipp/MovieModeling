every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
all in one tape?
i also put side two of london calling on there...
i have a bad feeling about this.
about the plane? what do you think it’s gonna crash? don’t say that...
i know we’ve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to london is the right thing to do. but in my heart... this feels wrong.
don’t  go, jack...
you mean don’t go at all? what about my internship?
believe me i know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
for us, kate.
right, for us. but...i’m afraid that if you get on that plane...
what?
go. i’m sorry, you should just go...
no, you’re right.  what are we doing?
we're being responsible.  go. get on the plane.
i can't seem to let go of you...
you hear me complaining about that?
did you really mean what you said about tuscany?
of course i did.
last night was great...
you are an amazing lover.  you should be giving motivational seminars.
thanks.  you're not bad yourself...
i want to see you again.
i'd like that, too.
tonight.
it's christmas eve, jack.
so we'll get egg nog.
i have to go to my parents' house out in jersey.  would you like to come?
jersey?  you know what the traffic's gonna be like?
i'm taking the train...
don't you have anywhere to go?
i've got plenty of places to go.
maybe i can try and sneak away some time tomorrow morning...  okay?
if it's something you feel strongly about.
mrs. peterson.
hello jack.  you don’t have to stop singing on my account...
it’s because i’m shy, betty.  so, when are you going to leave that old corpse mr. peterson and run away with me?
you know you could never satisfy me the way he does...
merry christmas, mr. campbell.
how’d you do this year, tony?
about four grand.  and a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from mrs. johnson in 9d.  i’m putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
just until the deutsche mark turns...
sorry, jack.  i told dee and the kids i'd be home by dinner.  you know, it being christmas eve and all.
is that tonight?
you think i like being here on christmas eve, alan?
i don't know.  maybe...
you're right, jack.  sorry... jack approaches alan.
i don't want you to be sorry, alan, i want you to be excited.  i want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  you know why?
why jack?
because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
you too?  this holiday's about giving, adelle.  and i'm giving everything i've got to this deal, so in a way, i'm more christmassy than anyone...  lifesaver?
you're a ray of sunshine, jack.
oh, and oxxford called...
ooh, my suits are ready...
kate reynolds...
her assistant said you could call her at home after eight.
her assistant?
yeah jack, her assistant...
kate reynolds was my girlfriend in college.  i almost married her...
you?  married?
almost married.  and almost a junior broker at e.f. hutton...
excuse me?
she didn't want me to go to london.  we're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
so you left her?  just like that?
god, no.  i thought about it for practically the entire flight...
stop jack, i'm getting all weepy.
i took the road less traveled, adelle.
and look where it's led you...  i'm gonna get her on the phone...
no...
no?!  you almost married this woman.  aren't you even curious what she wants?
she's probably just having a fit of nostalgia.  you know, lonely christmas eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.
peter.  i don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
that's because i'm a heartless bastard who only cares about money.
and god love you for it.
i just got a call from terry haight.  bob thomas is nervous...
that'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
someone's gonna have to nurse him through this.
why are you staring at my breasts, peter?
i need you, tiger..
where is he?
aspen.
hey peter, lemme ask you a question.  an old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on christmas eve...
you suddenly having trouble getting dates?
not by a long shot.
then leave it in the past. old flames are like old tax returns.  you keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose.
i'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  call the group.  schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
that'll be a nice little holiday treat.
i'm thinking i might walk tonight, frank.
nice night for it.  i'll have louis send your car home.
merry christmas to you, sir...
thanks.  to you too...
...06...14...18...48...right there.  four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  merry christmas and shit...
ticket bad.  you draw in lines with pencil.
what're you talkin' about?
you draw lines with pencil!  i know about this!
what!?  look at the ticket...!
get out, i call 911.
you leave now.  take ticket somewhere else.  next customer in line...!
you first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
get out!
do you wanna die?!
no.
yes you do...
look, i'm talking about a business deal here.  i buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter...  ...doesn't have a death wish  ...i just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
like i said, it's a business deal...
damn, you are the real thing...
how'd you know my name was jack?
i call all you white guys "jack."
you know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
there's no way i was gonna die in that deli...  let's just say i've been on a lucky streak lately.
a lucky streak, huh?
so you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe i shouldn't do this, i shoulda done that.
i don't do that.  that's just not for me...
okay, jack.  nice doing business with you... cash is about to take off...
hey...
what do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? you're just gonna do something you'll regret...
you want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
i'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy.  at a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
yeah, in most cases that'd be true.
i mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
oh man, you're serious...  this man thinks i need to be saved!
everyone needs something.
yeah?  what do you need?
me?
you just said everyone needs something.
i've got everything i need.
wow.  it must be great being you.  you got it all.
look, i'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
you still think this is about me, don't you?
sure it's about you.  but it's about society, too.
oh man, i'm gonna enjoy this one... just remember, jack, you did this.  you brought this on yourself...
rise...and...shine...!
you’re jumping, sweetheart...
mom, don’t you think we need to open the presents?
mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. that could be her present...
where’s my car?!  where’s my ferrari!?
what the hell are you talking about?  what’s he talking about?
look, can i just borrow your car?!  i promise it’ll be returned!
the caddy?  why don’t you take your own damn car!
sorry, pal.  entrance is for residents and guests only...
what are you talking about?  it’s me, jack campbell.  penthouse c. i put you into commercial paper!
uh-huh...
no...
thank you, betty.  i know if i can just sleep this off, i’ll be fine...
and sleep you shall. noblesse oblige is not dead.  not yet anyway...come, let’s get you some help.  surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
a shelter?!  i’m the richest guy in the building...i’ve got twice the square footage you have!
whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
frank.  where’s alan mintz?  is he here yet?
mr. mintz?  i don’t think so...building’s closed pal.  you’ll have to come back tomorrow.
look, i don’t know what’s going on here but i am senior vice president of this company.
i don’t care who you are.  it’s christmas and like i told you the building is closed.
maybe you’re not hearing me.  i am jack campbell...  right here.  jack campbell, president...
miss me, jack?
that’s my car!  you stole my car!
it’s a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
what?!
basically, it’s my car now.  get in.
might wanna fasten your seat belt, jack...
what the hell is happening to me?!
look, i don’t know what you’re getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
brought what on myself?! i didn’t do anything!
no?  c’mon, jack...i’ve got everything i need, i don’t have regrets, that’s just not for me... sound familiar?
you mean because you thought i was cocky i’m now on a permanent acid trip?!!
everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you.  you’re making a business deal...
give me my goddamn life back!
you?  what about me?  i’m working hard for you here, jack.  on christmas too!  now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way.  i was moved...
please.  just tell me what’s happening to me. in plain english.  none of that mumbo jumbo...
it’s a glimpse, jacko.
i glimpse?  a glimpse of what!?  what glimpse?! glimpse!
look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of ‘em take a couple seconds...  ...some of ‘em take a lot longer...
i asked you a direct question!  a glimpse of what?!
figure it out.  you got plenty of time.
how much time?!
as long as it takes to figure it out.  which, in your case, could be considerable.
look, i just want my life back.  now what’s it gonna take?  you wanna talk turkey?  let’s talk turkey!  how much money...?
do i look like i need your money.  it doesn’t work like that and i can’t tell you why.
why not?
because you got to figure it out for yourself.  are you listening to me?
figure it out?  figure what out?!
that’s it?  that’s all i get?!  a glare?!
look jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
what’s this, a signal? will you come whenever i ring it?
do i look like i live in a bottle?
but what do i do?
look jack i’m late.  i’d love to help you out some more but i gotta go handle my business...  happy trails.
i know, i moved the barca-lounger into the corner.  it’s throwin’ everybody off.  what do you think?
great room...
we’re friends, aren’t we?
maybe i don’t say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
i’m having kind of a bad day.
i read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
what am i saying?  you don’t need to hear that...  all i meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, that’s all.  is that you?
is it...?
trouble at work?
i don’t think so.
it’s not kate, is it?
you see, it’s like we’re in each other’s heads...
kate’s my wife...
look, you fit the profile exactly.  thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  you start thinking...this isn’t the life i dreamt about.  where’s the romance, where’s the joie de vivre?  suddenly, every lingerie ad in the newark star ledger represents a life you can’t have...
it’s just two kids, right?
are you okay?
yeah...fine.
what kind of man does that!?
i don’t know!  please stop yelling at me!
where were you?
i was in the city.
the city?  new york city?  why?
because that’s where i live.
jack...don’t even start...
look, you don’t understand.  i woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
look, we don’t have time for this right now, we’ll talk about it later.  now get dressed...  you’re not wearing that to the thompsons’ party. i don’t care how hilarious you think it is...
party?  oh no, i can’t go to a party...
you look forward to this party all year.  what’s with you today?
trust me on this kate.  i really don’t think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
what are you doing?
telling my mother she doesn’t have to stay with the kids.
why not?
because you’ll be here.
christ...  where the hell is the bathroom?
funny, jack.  i’m laughing on the inside.
like the dress...?
it’s lovely...
i thought i saw you notice it at the kids’ recital.
finger food...?
i don’t think so, thank you...
c’mon, as soon as i put them down, you’re gonna grab a couple...you always do...
mushroom puffs aren’t the only thing i do well...
well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. excuse me...
yes, i’m fine.  it’s just this god awful football phone!  who has a phone like this anyway?!
uh huh...
jack...
pro bono.  you don’t get paid at all.  nobody makes a dime.  well, bravo...
here you go...
you’re kidding me...
she’s your dog, jack.
no, she’s not.
fine, she’s the kid’s dog.  let’s go wake josh, see if he wants to walk her.
but it’s twenty degrees outside...
you’re having a bad day, i’ll go with you...actually, there’s no way in hell you’re gettin’ me back out there...
hello!
...my feet are hurtin’...
hey!
uh...that baby’s crying...
and...?
this isn’t my real life. it’s just a glimpse...
where’s my real dad?
i don’t know...
they did a pretty good job.
who did?
the aliens...in the mother ship.  you look just like him.
uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
do you like kids?
on a case by case basis...
you know how to make chocolate milk?
i think i could figure it out.
you promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
sure.
this is day care.  it’s where babies go when their parents are at work.
check...
i have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
five thirty.  okay.
try not to be late because kids don’t like to be the last one picked up.
got it.  good tip.
bye...
where do i go now?
big ed’s.
big ed’s?  big ed’s tires?  why...?
that’s where you work.
do i have a private office somewhere in the building?
uh...sure jack...  right back there...
thank you.
...i was the number one junior sales associate at e.f. hutton in 1988.  did you know that?
no, i didn’t...that’s great.
that’s the kind of thing you can really build on...
uh huh...
i mean sales has always been a feeder for m and a, always...
here we are, mag wheels...  hey jack, are you sure you’re okay?
well, i’m just a little confused right now about why i work here...
got a minute, jack?
i’ve got all the time in the world...
c’mon jack...
i mean it.  from what i can tell, we’re a mom and pop operation, we’re already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
jack.  i said the kids are asleep...
well that’s just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
hey!  i was watching that!
i thought we had a deal about you watching cnbc in bed.
i’m working on a new deal now...
wait a second.  you want me, don’t you?
that is the general idea, yes...
shouldn’t we grab some dinner first?  maybe a bottle of wine...?
it’s ten thirty, jack. by eleven you’re gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. we don’t have time for wining and dining.
whatever you say...honey.
thanks, jack...
no, i’m serious...you’re really stunning...
this is good stuff, jack, keep it coming...
i mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, there’s no question about that.  but this...  ...you’ve really grown into a beautiful woman...
how can you do that?
do what?
look at me like you haven’t seen me every day for the last twelve years...
we’re almost done here...
mary janes, mom.  you promised.
that’s right.  okay, let’s make a quick stop at the kids’ shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then i’ll run into the linen store...
i mean...wow...off the charts great.
it’s an unbelievable thing.  wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person.  i’m gonna buy it...
$2,400?!  are you out of your mind?
she got those shoes...
those shoes were twenty five dollars.  c’mon, take it off.  we’ll go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like.
no?
do you have any idea what my life is like?
excuse me?
i wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...i drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, kate.
i pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...i play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if i’m lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that i always have to drive everyone everywhere?  i spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...i’m sick of it.
really.
what’s in it for me? where are my mary janes?
it’s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, jack.
i can’t believe it’s not a disappointment to you!  jesus, kate, i could’ve been a thousand times the man i became.  how could you do this to me?  how could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
look, i’m sorry.  i’m sorry i was such a saint before and i’m such a prick now.  maybe i’m just not the same guy i was when we got married...
maybe you’re not.  the jack campbell i married wouldn’t need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if that’s what it’s gonna take, then buy it. just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids’ college fund.
well...annie for one.
surprise.  we’re pregnant...  yeah...that must’ve been...i mean that was very unexpected.  but what are you gonna do, right?
i think it worked out okay, don’t you?
sure.  i really like annie.
good, jack.  maybe we’ll keep her.
no, i love annie.  we had a lot of good times, didn’t we?
we were young...  remember that little place on charles street we used to go to?
charles street?  in the village?  when we were living in greenwich village...?  great times.  why’d we ever leave?
you can’t really raise a kid in an apartment in the village...
the trek out to the hospital every day didn’t help either...  you were great. surviving the heart attack was one thing...
you had a heart attack?
jack, stop that. i'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what would’ve happened if you hadn’t stepped in at the store.
that’s why i work for big ed?
our life in a nutshell...
if you want to look at it that way...
how would you look at it?
damn...
jesus, jack, this is a league match, for god’s sake!
where’s your follow through?  where’s your stance?
hey, i’m doing the best i can...  i’d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
you’re right.  why am i so competitive!? compensation, i guess. look, just focus, jack. you can still pick up the spare...
evelyn, right?
very funny.  i saw you out there on lane five. what do you have the flu or something?
something like that.
need a nurse?
you’re a nurse?
are we...?
are we what, jack?
is there something going on between us?
are we finally being honest?
it would help me if we were.
okay, you’re right, we’ve been dancing around this for years...
hey jack, you’re all flush.  i guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
i just saw evelyn thompson.
she is relentless.
she wants to have an affair with me.
she said that?
pretty much.
oh yeah...  what is it about you?
so could you write down her exact address?
whoa...whoa...wait a second, jack.  you’re not actually gonna cheat on kate?
it wouldn’t really be cheating...  it’s complicated.
look, maybe i’m not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one.  a little flirtation’s harmless but you’re playing with fire here.  the fidelity bank and trust is a tough creditor.  you make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
i’m telling you, those rules don’t apply to me, arn.
screw the rules.  i’m talking about the choice.
c’mon, evelyn thompson’s got no class.  she doesn’t marry dr. steve, the woman’s living in a trailer.
hey, is that really necessary?
all i’m saying it there isn’t a guy in union county who wouldn’t give his left nut to be married to kate...
how was the game, honey?
long, boring, and generally pretty sad. arnie seemed to enjoy it...  hey, where’s that chocolate cake...?
you mean this chocolate cake?
that’s my piece.  i was saving it because i got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
c’mon.
sorry, jack.  it’s too important to me.
you want the cake!?
i want it...
thank you...
it’s good, right?
say it, jack...
what...?
c’mon, you know what i like to hear...
yeah, baby, i know what you like to hear...
then say it...just say it to me...!
oh yeah, you’re a bad girl, baby... you make me so hot...i’m gonna take you to that special place...
not it...?
nice, jack.  you’re sweeping me off my feet.
what? you make me hot...
so jack, it’s your wife’s birthday, got anything to say to her?
it’s your birthday? today?  what’s your name?  where were you born?
jack.
wait a minute.  you’re my wife?
maybe i should wait...
no, open it...
i found it at an outlet store.  i know it’s a knock-off, but i think it’ll look great on you...
zeena...
you really are incredible...
enjoy it, sweetheart...
here’s the thing.  i really hadn’t planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.  you know, anniversary’s good all day...
what are you talking about?  you never wait all day.  you can barely wait until it’s light out.
i know that, but...
you actually forgot our anniversary.
i’ll fix it.  i’ll go out right now and get you something.  i’ll make it right.
not bad...i shoulda warned you.  dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
like what?
one year he had a solar system named after her...
don’t you think that’s a little gimmicky?
mom liked it.
maybe there’s a jewelry store back at the mall. i could get her a pair of earrings or something.
that’s good but...you did forget the anniversary.
right.  that’s a major oversight...  so if i’m kate...i can’t really afford the finer things, my husband’s career is a crushing disappointment to me, i’m trapped in suburbia...
fighting’s a part of it, annie.  you know that, right?
i’m not worried, mom. he’s still learning our ways...
jack...can we afford all this?
what’s the difference? i’m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
how do you even know about this place?
you are so not off the hook yet, slick.
but i’m gettin’ close, right?
i need to tell you something.
okay...
i think it may help us but there’s a slight chance it could make things worse.
now i’m worried...just say it.  whatever it is we’ll deal with it.
are you sure?
i used to be so sure about everything, you know?  i knew exactly who i was and what i wanted. then one morning i woke up and suddenly it was all different...
worse, you mean...
no.  well, maybe a few things.  but mostly just different...
i never used to be like this, kate.  i had it all figured out.  no doubts, no regrets.
and now...?
now...i don’t...
i think it’s good to be a little unsure about who you are.  it’s very human.
but you always seem so certain.
c’mon, jack, you think there aren’t mornings when i wake up and wonder what the hell i’m doing in new jersey...
that’s a big one for me, too.
my office is a dump, i answer my own phone...and you’ve seen my pay check.
your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
i mean yes, i help people that need it...
i guess...some of them are probably faking.
god, sometimes i think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a cd player...
imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
it’s wonderful...
good things...
what are you sure about?
you know champagne makes me do crazy things.
i’ll just full yours up to the top.  happy anniversary, sweetheart.
i don’t know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off.
i’m out of the doghouse?
way out...
you’re so...beautiful...
i already told you you were gonna get lucky, jack...
my god, all this time...i never stopped loving you...
that’s all i wanted to hear...
i could stay here forever...
i don’t think i’d fight you on that one...
for the money, they’re hands down the best radial we carry...
okay, i’ll take them...
you won’t regret it...  tommy!  set mr. conlin up with four b.f. goodrich g-force t/a’s...  ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume...
kate’s on two, jack.  nice ride...
if you’re into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
you want me to handle him?  i think i’m ready...
why don’t you let me take this one, kenny?
okay, chief.
peter lassiter...
do i know you?
not exactly. i’ve seen you on cnbc.  you look taller in real life...
...we’re really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
but you’re not interested in boutique dollars...  i get it...
mr. mintz.
please, call me alan. we try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
i can see that, alan.
you have kids, jack?
uh...actually, yes. two... good ones.
i was a sales associate, at e.f. hutton.
a broker? really. and now you’re in the tire business?
that’s right. and auto supply...
uh huh. the retail end, i understand.
uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
mind if i ask what kind of sales you did last year? ballpark...
we did one point seven million in total revenue...
uh huh...one point seven. and what do you project for this year?
well, alan, i think we’re gonna have a banner year. sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
really. so you’re projecting what, a tad over two million?
look, i know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year.  and i know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
i’m not trying to knock the tire business, jack.
it’s okay, alan. i get it. i’m in your shoes, i’m thinking exactly the same thing...but here’s the thing. business is business.  wall street, main street, it’s all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell they’re gonna send their kids to college.  it’s just people...
and i know people.
i’m sure you do...
take you, for instance...
what about me?
you drink about sixteen diet cokes a day. you’re an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. you drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch...
he certainly has your number, alan.
you’re a little tougher, peter.
for one thing, you like expensive things.
that’s easy. you’ve seen my car.
okay...you smoke hoyo de monterreys. you’re a scotch man, single malt, not because it’s trendy but because you’ve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. you have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. you wept openly the day the dow hit ten thousand...
...that’s our war room. we did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
seven.  really.
good for you. why shouldn’t you protect what’s yours.
i don’t think you’re hearing me.
oh, i’m hearing you, alan. that’s not the problem. the problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine.  and i don’t care how low on the totem pole i start, i will get it back...  so do yourself a favor and don’t get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your french country antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office.
pretty incredible, isn’t it?
it’s like a museum.
so what’s the big surprise? you didn’t rent this place for the weekend, did you?
think bigger.
for the week?
this place is a perk, kate.
a perk for what?
a company called p.k. lassiter and associates investment house uses it to attract new executives...
you’re talking to their new vice president of mergers and acquisitions.
what are you talking about, jack?
are you out of your mind?
i don’t think so. this is going to be a better life for all of us, honey.  we’ll put annie and josh in private schools...
annie goes to a great school.
i’m talking about the best schools in the country here, kate...
jack, what could you possibly be thinking? what about my job?
this is new york city, it’s like the needy people capital of the world.  those jersey clients of yours aren’t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
i can’t believe you want to move back into the city.  i thought the reason we left was because we didn’t want to raise the kids here?
no, this is the center of the universe.  if i were living in roman times, i would live in rome, where else?  today, america is the roman empire and new york is rome itself. john lennon.
jack.
i can do that.  i want to do that.  for all of us. i need to do that as a man...  think about it.  no more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
then get a goddamn snow blower!
don’t do that...
look, you’re making this into something it’s not. this isn’t a referendum on our lives, kate. it’s a step forward...  don’t you see?  i’m talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
very nice. what is it?
mary had a little lamb.
ah. a classic...
what are you doing?
ringing my bell...
you can’t do this. you can’t keep coming in and out of people’s lives, messing things up...
c’mon, jack...
i’ve got kids, i’m going home...
you know what the word glimpse means, j? it’s by nature an impermanent thing.
is it morning yet?
no, honey. go back to sleep.
it’s been interesting, that’s for sure.
but i’ve done some good things too, haven’t i?
you’ve been jack campbell.  and that’s always a good thing...
i need you to remember me, kate.  how i am right now, right this very moment.  i need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
are you okay, jack?
please, just promise me you’ll do that. you have to promise, kate. because if you don’t, then it’s like it never happened and i don’t think i could live with that.
i promise, jack...
promise me again...
i promise. come to bed, honey.
that’s totally see through...
merry christmas...
christmas?  it can’t be christmas...
can i help you?
is kate here? does kate live here?!
kate? no, there’s no one here named kate.  is that good enough for you?
damn...damn...damn...
hey, are you okay?
no...i’m not...
is there anything i can do for you?
hey, my wife’s in the kitchen. you got a cigarette?
i’m sorry, no...
hey, you can’t park that thing here.
it’s me, jack...
i don’t care if you’re tim allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can’t park here.
tell me you recognize me, arnie.  please...
how’d you know my name?
we bowl together. we’re bowlers ...we won a championship...we’re winners.
i never won anything in bowling.
wait a second...  jack...jack...
yes...jack campbell...
of course. jack campbell. i went to high school with you...you played baseball, right?  you’re doing well...
yes, that’s it...yes, we went to high school together.
you never really talked to me.  i wanted to talk to you, man...
yeah...i guess i just wanted you to know, we could’ve been really good friends...
hello?
hey santa, where are you? everybody’s here.
adelle?
you were supposed to be here half an hour ago...the emergency strategy session? your trip to aspen? they’re all panicked here...
jack, are you okay?
what’s going on here?
it’s not good.  bob thomas has secretly been talking to a european drug company. we’re not sure which one, julia’s on it right now. word is they’re willing to let him buy a minority stake and keep running the entire company.  the global people are up in arms.  they say we should’ve been prepared for this.  we’re in trouble here, jack...
excuse me?
but i think i like you better this way...
is this another one of those sun tzu “art of war” tricks?
no.
so what are we gonna do, jack?
kate...
jack...god, it’s been so long...you look...
you look great.
it’s good to see you...
i'm sorry...
don’t worry about it, jack...
what’s going on?
i’m moving to paris...it was right here...  it’s a box marked “jack.”  i put it in the stack for the salvation army...
paris?
do you want me to look for the box or call the airline?
hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
hey, kind of giving up christmas day for my ex-boss here.
you didn’t seem to mind offering to help me on christmas day when you were unwrapping that prada bag i gave you.
maybe it’s by the wardrobe boxes...
you’re moving...
uh huh. to paris. my firm has an office there and i’m going to be heading it up.
to paris. paris, france.
that’s the one...
so you’re not at a non- profit firm?
not with what they pay me...
you’re not married, are you?
no, jack, i never got married. you?
not exactly...  can we just take a minute here?  maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
i’ll go for a cup of coffee!
yes!
i found it!
congratulations. the la guardia flight’s canceled but i got you out of kennedy on united at nine. am i good or what?
you can’t go!
jesus, jack...
don’t get on that plane!
jack.
please. let’s just go have a cup of coffee. that’s all i’m asking for. i’m sure there’s another flight to paris tonight.
what do you want from me? you want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
don’t do this, jack... but he continues...
we have two kids, annie and josh...
