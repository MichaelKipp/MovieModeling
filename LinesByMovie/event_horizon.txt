this is weir.
dr. weir, admiral hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
you wanted to see me, admiral?
i apologize for the short notice, bill, but we have had something come up that requires your immediate attention. lyle?
incredible... these are the same coordinates before the ship disappeared... this, this happened? this is not some kind of hoax?
i would not bring you here on a hoax. houston confirms the telemetry and i.d. codes.
it is the event horizon. she is come back.
that ship was lost in deep space, seven years ago. if the titanic sailed into new york harbor, I would find it more plausible.  houston wants aerospace to send out a search and rescue team, investigate the source of the transmission. if it really is the event horizon, they will attempt a salvage.  we need you to prepare a detailed briefing on the ship's systems for the salvage crew...
a written briefing can not possibly anticipate the variables on a mission like this. i have to go with them.
dr. weir, you have no experience with salvage procedures.
i designed the ship's propulsion system. i am the only person capable of evaluating the performance of the gravity drive. you can not send a search and rescue team out there alone and expect them to succeed. that would be like... like sending an auto- mechanic to work on the shuttle.
i can understand your desire to redeem your reputation, dr. weir, but it does not factor into this.
this is not about my reputation! this is not about me at all!  the event horizon was created for one reason: to go faster than light. imagine mankind exploring new solar systems, colonizing new worlds. seven years ago, we did not just lose the ship and the crew. we lost the dream.  i have to go.
it is not that simple.  lyle, play the recording for dr. weir.
navigation control tried to hail the vessel. this was the only response.
since the initial transmission, there is been no further contact. just the beacon, every two minutes.
the crew? could they still be alive?
the ship had life support systems for eighteen months. they are been gone seven years.
someone sent that message. admiral, you have to put me on that ship.
it is against my better judgement, but I will run this by the man downstairs. you will know my decision by the end of the day.
thank you.
do not thank me, bill. I am not doing you any favors.
you are not seriously considering sending him?
you do not just dismiss bill weir. the man held oppenheimer's chair at princeton. if the event horizon had worked, he would have gone down in history as the greatest mind in physics since einstein.
the official inquiry blamed weir's design for the ship's loss.
that does not mean a damn thing. they were looking for a scapegoat and weir fit the bill. but he is not responsible for what happened to the ship.
does he know that?
what is on your mind?
he does not belong on this mission. responsible or not, he blames himself. he is too close to it.  and then there is his wife.
it is been two years since she died. he is over it.
some things you do not get over.
i want our best people on this. where is miller?
the lewis and clark just returned from patrol in the asteroid belt, she is docked in bay four.
i can not believe this, i have not gotten more than my hand in six weeks and now this shit. why not mars, cap, mars has women...
smith's right. neptune? there is nothing out there. if something happens, we will be on our own.
i do not like it either, but you know the rules: we get the call, we go. is the course locked in?
locked and cocked.
we are past the outer marker, we can engage the ion drive whenever you are ready.
justin?
everything green on my boards, skipper.
start the countdown.
ion drive will engage in... t-minus ten minutes.
let's go.
time to play spam in the can.
do not start with me, cooper.
captain miller, i just want to say...
the clock is running, dr. weir. if you will follow the rest of the crew, they will show you to the gravity tanks.
what is the hold up?
just loading the last of the co2 scrubbers.  good for four months.
i put in for a replacement for you but no one...
no, no, its alright. i talked to my ex, he will keep denny over christmas and I will get him this summer.  goddam it, skipper... i have not seen him in two months.
i am sorry. but now we have to go to work.
is that an offer?
it is not.
captain miller, i appreciate this opportunity...
doctor weir, my crew is not going on your mission because we want to. we were pulled off a well deserved leave, to be sent out to the middle of nowhere, and no one's even told us why.
I have been authorized to brief you and the crew once we reach neptune space.
until then, do what you are told and stay out of my way.
first time in a grav couch?
yes.
do not worry about it. he is hard, but he is fair. you are lucky to be shipping out with him. he is one of the few captains in the service with experience in the outer reach.
he is been past mars?
he served on the goliath.
was not that ship destroyed?
they attempted to rescue a supply shuttle bound for titan. the shuttle's oh-two tanks ruptured during the rescue, flooded both ships with pure oxygen. there was a spark and both ships were incinerated. the skipper and three others just made it to a lifeboat. captain miller was able...
claire...
dj!  it is okay. you are okay. just breathe.
damn, dr. weir, do not scare us like that. coffee?
what?
coffee.
no, thank you.
starck, why are not you on the bridge?
i just finished drying...
then what are you doing here? come on, people, let's go!  and cooper... put some pants on.
30 hours to neptune orbit.
all boards are green, everything's five by five.
okay, listen up. as you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. dr. weir, this is: starck, navigation; smith, pilot, justin, ship's engineer --
you can call him baby-bear, he loves that...
this is cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway?
ballast.
i am your best friend. i am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...
he is a rescue technician. peters, medical technician. dj...
trauma.
and this is mission specialist dr. william weir. we all know where we are going. dr. weir is going to tell us why.
that means top-secret, cooper.
i heard it.
...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!
everybody shut up! let the man speak.
you can not do that.
the law of relativity prohibits faster- than-light travel...
relativity, yes. we can not break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. the ship does not really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.
how?
well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space-time consistent with weyl tensor dynamics until the space- time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity...
hey...
say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from "point a" here...  ...to "point b," here.  now: what is the shortest distance between two points?
a straight line.
wrong. the shortest distance between two points...
...is zero. that is what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point a and point b coexist in the same space and time. after the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  it is called a gravity drive.
how do you know all this?
i built it.
i can see why they sent you along.
so if the ship did not blow up, what happened?
it was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. the event horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. they received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive.  and the ship vanished from all our scopes. no radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. they disappeared without a trace.  until now.
where has it been for the last seven years?
that is what we are here to find out.
jesus...
what is that?
what does it say?
nsa encryption specialists have deciphered some of the message...
from what?
you are convinced the crew could still be alive? after seven years?
the event horizon only had life support for eighteen months. it seems impossible, but in light of the transmission... i have to think that someone has managed to endure until now.
skipper, do we get hazard pay for this?
crossing the horizon. optimum approach angle is fourteen degrees.
come around to three-three-four...
heading three-three-four...
...make your approach vector negative fourteen degrees...
one-four degrees...
we have a lock on the event horizon's navigation beacon. it is in the upper ionosphere, we are in for some chop.
bring us in tight. starck, get on the horn, see if anyone's listening...
this is u.s. aerospace command vessel lewis and clark, hailing event horizon, event horizon, do you read...? this is the lewis and clark, hailing...
matching speed... now. range to target ten thousand meters and closing... skipper, i got a bad feeling about this...
we are all on edge, smith. we are a long way out...
that is not it. that ship was built to go faster than light... that is just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
what are you trying to say? "if god had intended man to fly, he would have given us wings?"
something like that, yeah.
i guess we are about to find out. keep us slow and steady.
yes, sir.
dr. weir...!
where is she?
dead ahead, 5000 meters.
we have got some weather.
i noticed. starck, anybody home?
if they are, they are screening their calls.
range 3000 meters and closing.
1500 meters. we are getting too close...
where is it?
the scope is lit, it is right in front of us...
1000 meters...
proximity warning! 900, 800 meters, 700... we are right on top of it, we are going to hit!
starck...
jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
she is not ugly.
range 500 meters and holding. turbulence is dropping off...
picking up magnetic interference.
put it through tacs. smith, you up for a flyby?
love to.
foredecks. crew quarters, bridge, medical and science labs, hydroponics, what have you. that central section connects the forward decks to the engineering containment area. can we move in closer?
shit, doc, any closer and we are going to need a rubber...
that is the engineering containment. and there is the main airlock. we can dock there.
smith, use the arm and lock us onto that antennae cluster.
be careful. it is not a load bearing structure...
it is now.  we are locked in.
starck, give me a read.
the reactor's still hot. we have got several small radiation sources, leaks probably. nothing serious.
do they have pressure?
affirmative. the hull's intact... but there is no gravity and the thermal units are off line. I am showing deep cold. the crew could not survive unless they were in stasis.
something is wrong with the bio-scan.
radiation interference?
there is not enough radiation to throw off the scan. I am picking up trace life forms, but i can not get a lock on the location.
could it be the crew? if they were in suspended animation, would not that effect the scan?
if they were in stasis, I would get a location, but these readings, they are all over the ship. it does not make any sense.
okay. we do it the hard way. deck by deck, room by room. starck, deploy the umbilicus. i believe you are up for a walk, mr. justin. go get your bonnet on.
yes, sir!
dr. weir, i need you on the bridge.
captain, i did not come out here to sit on your bridge, i need to be on that ship...
once the ship is secured, we will bring you on board --
that is not acceptable --
-- once we have secured the ship, that is the way it is!  i need you to guide us from the comm station. this is where i need you. help us to do our job.
...come on, skipper, i already put my shoes on...
you have had plenty eva, coop, it is justin's turn. stay on station. if anything happens...
I will be all over it.
you still need the rope? i thought you were one a those spacemen with ice in ya veins.
I would rather be on the rope and not need it than need it and not have it. now step aside, old man.
we have got pressure.
clear and open on my mark. three... two... one... mark.
jesus its huge.
ice crystals everywhere. this place is a deep freeze.
you are in the central corridor. it connects the personnel areas to engineering.
peters and i will search the forward decks. justin, take engineering. no hot-dogging, not on this one, alright?
here's another one. they are all over the place.
they are explosive charges.
i can see that, what are they for?
in an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. that way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
that means they did not abandon ship.
so where are they? starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
there is no one in the corridor but us.
not according to the computer.
peters is right, no one's here.
i do not know, this place is really dark, i can not see a thing...
easy, peters, we are okay, we are okay. let's finish the sweep.
captain miller, the foredecks are just ahead.
i can see the hatch.
starck, you still showing those readings?
that is an affirmative.
keep your eyes open.
any survivors?
negative.
no one?
they are empty, dr. weir. moving forward.
you have reached the first containment seal. the engineering decks are on the other side.
we still have pressure. the radiation count's steady at 7 millirads an hour.
background radiation. perfectly safe.
dr. weir, what is this the door to?
you are at the bridge, ms. peters. you still have not seen any crew?
yes, we can see some kind of mist. what is that?
blood. looks like arterial spray.
can you see a body?
there is no one here.
the blood came from somewhere, peters...
there is no one here, skipper.
okay. I am on the bridge.
what you got, peters?
everything's been shut down. conserving power, i guess. green light on the hull, it is intact.
the science workstation has power, I will see if i can find the crew from here.
what is it?
ship's log.
I have reached another containment door. this thing's huge...
that is the second containment seal. beyond that, engineering.
I am going in.
i found one.
alive?
frozen.
what happened to his eyes?
explosive decompression.
decompression would not do that.
...do you copy?
uh, yeah coop, I am still here.
shit! do not do that! where the fuck are you?
I am in the second containment area. it is pitch black in here. there must have been a coolant leak. man, this shit is everywhere. i can not see a damn thing.
holy shit...
justin?
i think i found something...
what the hell is that?
that is the core: the gravity drive. the heart of the ship.
justin, check the containment for radiation leaks. peters...
...how's the client?
crystallized.
justin, finish your sweep.
almost done, i just gotta check one thing...
what is it?
i do not know. the life readings just went off the scale.
miller, do you read me, peters --
get them back --
I am trying, goddammit --
what is happening?
i do not know, the screens are dead...!
the safety circuit's failed!
we are losing atmosphere...
can anybody hear me...
skipper...
peters...
...you okay?
yeah. I am -- I am okay.
we have a man down...
coop, where are you...
the containment, second containment...
hold on, coop...
captain miller...
smith, where the hell have you been?!
we have a situation here...
do we have enough time for a weld?
we do not have time to fart.
we are losing pressure at 280 liters a second and our oxygen tanks are cracked. in three minutes, our atmosphere will be gone. we are fucking dead.
no one's dying on my watch, smith! what about the reserve tanks?
they are gone.
what?
it still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
what if the air has gone bad? we can not wear these suits forever.
i do not think this is a good idea, we do not even know what happened on that ship...
it beats dying, mister smith.
dr. weir's right. get on board the event horizon. I will meet you at the airlock.
but...
you heard me, smith. peters, are you with me?
everybody okay?
we are all here.
okay. let's find out how much time we just bought.
we have not tested the air yet. it could be contaminated...
no time. we need whatever's left in our suits to repair the clark. like it or not, this is the only oxygen for three billion kilometers.
it tastes bad.
but you can breathe it.
the antennae array's completely fried, we have got no radio, no laser, no highgain... no one's going to be coming to help us.
how much oh-two do we have?
oxygen is not the problem.
carbon dioxide?
it is building up with every breath we take. and the co2 filters on the event horizon are shot.
we can take the filters from the clark...
i thought of that, with the filters from the clark, we have got enough breathable air for twenty hours. after that, we would better be on our way home.
what about the life readings you picked up?
the event horizon sensors show the same thing: "bio-readings of indeterminate origin." right before that wave hit the clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it is back to its previous levels.
what is causing the readings?
i do not know, but whatever it is, it is not the crew.
so where is the rest of the crew? we have been over every inch of this ship and all we have found is blood. dr. weir? any suggestions?
captain miller, you copy?
I am here, smith, how is the clark?
I have found a six inch fracture in the outer hull. we should be able to repair it and re-pressurize, it is going to take some time.
we do not have time, smith. in twenty hours we run out of air.
understood.
how is he?
his vitals are stable, but he is unresponsive to stimuli. he might wake up in fifteen minutes. he might not wake up at all.
peters, i want you to go through the ship's log, see if we can not find some answers.
i can use the station in medical, keep an eye on justin...
fine. starck, i want you to repeat the bio-scan...
what is the point? I will just get the same thing...
not acceptable. i want to know what is causing those readings. if the crew is dead, i want the bodies, i want the crew found.
i can reconfigure the scan for c-12, amylase proteins.
do it. dr. weir...
yes.
one of my men is down. i want to know what happened to him.
it was like... nothing was there... and then justin appeared and the core... became metal...
no, he didn't.
you were not there. i saw it.
saw what, mr. cooper? what did you really see, because what you are describing is not physically possible...
i do not know what happened to justin.
I am telling you, i saw it...
what you saw could have been an optical effect caused by gravitational distortion.
i know what i saw and it was not a fucking "optical effect!"
hold on, what is this "gravitational distortion?"
it is possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the core, distorting space-time. they could be what hit the lewis and clark.
what could cause them?  what is in the core?
it is complicated...
how much time do you need? we have seventeen hours and forty-two minutes. now: what is in the core?
that is how the gravity drive works, you see: it focuses the black hole's immense gravitational power to create the gateway. that is how the event horizon travels faster than light.
i can not believe we built this.
it is insane.
"insane?" the finest astronauts fought to be posted to this ship. it would take the lewis and clark a thousand years to reach our closest star. the event horizon could be there in a day...
if it worked.
if it worked, yes.
i want this room sealed. the second containment is off limits.
there is no danger. the black hole is contained behind three magnetic fields, it is under control.
your black hole damn near ripped my ship apart. it may have killed one of my men.  no one goes near that thing.
what is wrong?
nothing. it is nothing.
you been out there a long time. trying to break my record?
I would rather spend the next twelve hours outside than another five minutes in this can. this ship is bad. it watches you.
what?
you heard me. this ship, it is crazy: trying to go faster'n light, that is like the tower of babel.
shit, smith, you are going biblical on me.
you know what happened to the tower of babel, do not you? it fell down.
you are sucking too much nitrogen in your mix.
why dr. weir, i think you are in love.
hmmm. claire used to tell me i loved the event horizon more than i loved her. i told her that was not true, i just knew the event horizon better, that is all.
claire is your wife?
yes.
it must be hard, being so far away from her.
yes. i miss her. she died. two years now.
I am sorry.
you have something, dr. weir?
the date.
what about it?
the event horizon's computer think's it is 2034.
it is 2041...
exactly. the ship's internal clock is off by seven years.
maybe a power interruption crashed the system...
no, there is no evidence of a surge or spike of any kind. it is as if time just... stopped for seven years.
explanation?
intense gravitational fields effect the passage of time, it is possible...  black holes make sense on paper, it is all math, you see, but as to what really happened...  the event horizon has passed beyond our plane of reality, and like lazarus, returned from the dead.
what the hell is that? dr. weir?
i do not know.
i can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
do it.
what is happening...?
a power drain --
we barely have enough power for life support as it is, if we can not stop the drain, we are not going to make it.
the core...!
we do not get the power back, our air's going to go bad.
check the core for radiation. carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...
goddammit, dj, it was not a hallucination! i saw a man, he was on fire. and then he disappeared.
maybe one of the original crew?
no. it was someone else.
who?
dr. weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
no. i saw nothing.
i did.
about an hour ago. in medical. i saw my son. he was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were...
is not it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
I have seen bodies before. this is different.
i did not see anything and i do not have to see anything. this ship is fucked.
thank you for that scientific analysis, mister smith.
hey! you do not need to be a scientist figure it out...
...you break all the laws of physics, you think there will not be a price? you already killed the first crew...
that is enough!
sir.
get outside, go back to work. I will join you shortly.
we are a long way from home and we are in a bad place. let's not make it worse. if anyone has any constructive suggestions, now is the time.
i think i can stabilize the fields around the singularity, that should prevent another power drain.
do it.
to conserve our oxygen, we should severely restrict our activity. anyone who can should get some sleep.
i do not need sleep, dj. i need answers.
miller...
what is it, starck?
...i ran the bio-scan with the dna/rna filter. the results were bio-readings of indeterminate origin...
"...bio-readings of indeterminate origin," do not you have anything useful to tell me?
I have got a theory.
go ahead.
there was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. we picked up a similar readings right before the clarke was damaged. what if there were a connection between the two? the gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system...
you have got to listen...
to what? what are you saying? this ship is alive?
i did not say that, i said the bio- readings correspond to what happened to you, the ship is reacting to us...
we are hanging on by our fingernails and you are giving me bullshit stories...
it is not bullshit, it is the only conclusion the data supports...
starck, do you know how crazy that sounds? it is impossible.
i know that.
if you knew it was impossible, then why did you waste my time?
i thought you wanted an answer. and that is the only one i have.
what i want is to survive the next ten hours.
nine hours and twenty-two minutes.
I am going outside to work on the clark. and starck... do not tell anyone what you just told me. we have got enough to worry about.
what is wrong?
you did not hear it? you must have heard it!
what are you doing?
it wants me. i have to go.
in our current environment, dr. weir, self-control is an asset.
I am alright. please.
what is it?
the forward airlock.
miller, smith, cooper, any of you in the airlock?
that is a negative, starck.
justin.
we will have to re-route through the port conduit to the apu.
what about the accumulator...?
miller, come in...
what is going on in there, starck?
justin's in the airlock.
what?
he is awake, he is in the airlock, he is not wearing a suit.
stay here! do not stop working!
but justin...
I will get him.
he is engaged the override.
can you shut it down?
I am on my way, starck.
you better hurry. he is engaged the override, we can not open the inner door.
yes. yes, justin, we heard it.
keep him talking.
do you know what it was?
what, justin, what shows you?
it will not stop, it goes on and on and on...
what does?
the dark inside me.
...it's inside and it eats and eats until there is nothing left.
"the dark inside..."? i do not understand.
from the other place...
almost got it.
come on, baby-bear, open this door...
oh my god oh my god...
starck!
we have to do something, oh god...
skipper, justin just activated the door. it is on a thirty second delay...
patch me through to him.
justin.
skipper, you gotta help me...
...i do not want to die...!
you are not going to die! not today! i want you to do exactly as i say and I am going to get you out of there, alright?
but i can't... i got to get out of here... skipper, please...
justin. i will not let you die.
tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
five seconds.
I have got a pulse, he is alive...
pressure?
90 over 50 and falling... .
he is crashing...
intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
his peritoneum has ruptured...
one thing at a time, let's keep him breathing. start the drip, 15cc's fibrinogen, christ, he is bleeding out...
he will live... if we ever make it back.
we will make it.
peters. we need to know what happened to the crew. before it happens to us.
I will get back to the log. but on the bridge, i will not go back, back in there...
thanks.
justin said something about, "the dark inside me..." what did he mean?
it means nothing.
is that your "expert opinion?" the only answer we have had out of you is "i do not know."
justin just tried to kill himself. the man is clearly insane.
i want to know what caused that noise. i want to know why one of my crew tried to throw himself out of the airlock.
thermal changes in the hull could have caused the metal to expand and contract very suddenly, causing reverberations --
that is bullshit and you know it! you built this fucking ship and all I have heard from you is bullshit!
what do you want me to say?
you said this ship creates a gateway...
yes...
to what? where did this ship go? where did you send it?
i do not know...
where has it been for the past seven years?
i do not know...
the "other place," what is that...?
i do not know!  i do not know. there is a lot of things going on here that i do not understand. truth takes time.
that is exactly what we do not have, doctor.
of course not. justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. just one of those things.  i swore I would never lose another man. i came close today. real close.
"another man?" who?
i, i tried to go back for him, to save him, but i could not get to him in time. the fire... have you ever seen fire in zero-gravity? it is like a liquid, it slides over everything. it was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. and then he was gone.  i never told anyone until now. but this ship knew, dj. it knows about the goliath, it knows about corrick. it knows our secrets. it knows what we are afraid of.  and now you are going to tell me it is carbon dioxide.
no.
what is it?
I have been listening to the transmission. and i think houston made a mistake in the translation.
go on.
they thought it said, "liberatis me," "save me," but it is not "me." it is "tutemet:" "save yourself."
it is not a distress call. it is a warning.
it gets worse.
do you hear it? right there.
hear what?
it sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "hell."
"save yourself. from hell."  what are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?
no. i do not believe in that sort of thing.  but if dr. weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. who knows where this ship has been... what it is seen...  and what it is brought back with it.
captain miller, we are ready to repressurize the clark.
on my way.
it is holding... she is holding...!
we are still venting trace gasses, gimme twenty minutes to plug the hole.
you got any coffee?
it is cold.
i do not care.
we are leaving.
you can't, your orders are specific...
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." the crew is dead, dr. weir. this ship killed them. and now it is killing us.
you are insane. you have lost your mind.
maybe you are right. but it is still my command, and i have leeway to abort when i feel there is an unacceptable threat to my crew. and i think there is.  starck, download all the files from the event horizon's computers. coop, smith, finish moving the co2 scrubbers back onto the clark.
don't... do not do this...
it is done.
what about my ship?
we will take the lewis and clark to a safe distance and then launch tac missiles at the event horizon until i am satisfied that she has been destroyed.  fuck this ship.
you... you can not do that!
watch me.
you can not leave. she will not let you.
just get your gear back onto the lewis and clark, doctor, or you will find yourself looking for a ride home.
thank you.
captain, we got a problem.
now what?
she was right behind me, i turn around, she is gone. she could be anywhere.
alright. prep the clark for launch. I will find her.
solid as a rock.  hey, smith...
smith, clear that airlock, man, I am coming in.
roger that.
skipper...
what is it, smith?
i just saw weir, i think he was messing around on the clark.
smith, get out of there...
come again, skipper?
one of the explosives is missing from the corridor. i think weir may have put it on the clark.
get off the clark now and wait for me at the airlock.
no, no, we just got her back together...
get out of there now!
where is it, where is it...
smith? smith! fuck!
dj. the clark's gone. smith and cooper are dead.
what happened?
weir. he used one of the explosives from the corridor.
i told you... she will not let you leave...
son of a bitch!
please...
oh, god, dj, what do i... how do i...
please... kill...
oh god...
your eyes...
i do not need them anymore. where we are going, we will not need eyes to see.
what are you talking about?
do you know what a singularity is, miller? does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is?  it is nothing. absolute and eternal nothing. and if god is everything, then i have seen the devil.  it is a liberating experience.
if you miss me, you will blow out the hull. you will die too.
what makes you think I will miss?
weir can not be alive.
whatever was on that bridge was not weir.
let me breathe, let me breathe...
you are okay now, it is over...
weir activated the drive. he is sending us to the other place.
we have got to shut it down, we have got to...
how? the bridge is gone.
there must be a way! what about engineering?
can you shut it down?
i do not know the process, dr. weir was the expert...
i do not want to go where the last crew went. I would rather be dead.
blow the fucker up.
blow it up?
we blow the corridor. use the foredecks as a lifeboat, separate it from the rest of the ship. we stay put...
...and the gravity drive goes where no man has gone before.
you prep the gravity couches. I am going to manually arm those explosives.
will it work?
it worked for weir. prep the tanks.
I will do it --
no. I will be right back.
I am going to activate the emergency beacon.
hurry.
what...?
run!
we are armed. this fucker's ready to blow...
...repeat, we are armed...
miller, he is back, he was in the tank...
weir.
he is dead...
weir is dead.
then who the fuck are you?
your fear. do you remember the goliath, miller?
what are you?
you know.
you want me to believe you are the devil, well, i don't, that is bullshit!
I am not the devil.
then what, what are you? tell me...
better if i just show you.
there is no devil. there is no god. there is only... nothing.
you are lying...!
I am not asking you to believe me. you will see for yourself... and so will your crew. you are all coming with me.
starck... cooper...
you can not have them. go to hell.
nooo!
