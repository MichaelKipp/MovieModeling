ms. harvey... my name is taryn miles. i'm a criminal psychologist working for the fbi. i'm here to ask you a few questions.
<i>here's the part where i'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until i speak with my attorney.'</i>
<i>the driver's name was locus fender. we know that he was in on the heist.</i> <b> int. armored car -- next </b> locus fender  is behind the wheel of the armored car. his unshaven, disheveled appearance looks totally out of place in his security uniform. <b> int. vegas security lockdown -- night </b> taryn is now scrawling notes on a pad.
where is the money?
i don't know.
i think that you're lying. i think you know exactly where the money is.
you're trying to scare me into falsely incriminating myself... and it's not working. i said i'd tell you everything i know. you and your friends behind the mirror.
is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to drake bishop... owner of the stratosphere hotel & casino?
yes.
you then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
he sent us out to the fender compound. out in the desert near the chicken ranch.
<i>that's my best friend. his name is choco. he's always fancied me... but too shy to ever do anything about it.</i>
chi-chi!  chi-chi!
chi-chi has gone to doggie heaven, bitch!
is that you, domino?
nice to see you again, edna.
don't fuck with us, edna! there are at least three more limbs where that one came from!
i can certainly think of one more!
he's still alive, edna!

why must you fight... everything that is normal? you are blessed with such beauty. life could be so easy... if only you allowed yourself to fit the mold.
the mold? i am living among these crypto-fascist orange county cunts... with daddy's bmw and the boob job... just waiting to implode.
crypto-fascist? who talks like this?!
i refuse to turn out like them. twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband.  stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. they let the boys control their lives. not me.
must you use that awful word?
cunt.
stop it.
cunt.
i said stop it.
cunt. it's just a word. why does everyone in this fucking country get their knickers in a twist by the slightest bit of indecent conversation?
alright. time to ditch this thing. did you take a look at the bathroom window?

<i>holy shit... this bitch is fierce.</i>
i've been training since i was twelve. knives. guns. throwing stars. you name it... i can fight with it. i'm a hard worker and a fast learner.  nothing scares me. i'm not afraid to die.
you want to be a bounty hunter. why does a pretty little thing like you want to be a bounty hunter?
because i want justice. i want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong.  and i want to have a little fun.
you can save that pretty woman shit. the name is domino.
domino. do you have a last name... domino?
no last names. just domino. the less you know about me the better, okay?
where are we going?

<i>we gotta bring him in.</i>
will you speak the fucking english language? the poor girl has no clue what you're talking about.  the boy speaks english, you know. reads, writes, i swear it. he does this when he's around girls. thinks it's cute.

i was a musician.
really? did you play in a band?
yeah. i played base guitar for pat benatar.
i... <i>love...</i> pat benatar.
yeah?! well... i loved her too.
oh my god... you mean... the two of you dated?!
we dated off and on for two years. but life on the road is tough. the pressure of the tour... relationships within a band... sometimes it leads to jealousy.
how did you meet choco?
i found him pan-handling on third street promenade. took him under my wing. we been hunting together ever since.
jesus christ! what's that smell?

you white folks don't understand the natural beauty of a woman's figure. those are birthing hips. more cushion for the pushin'.

maybe you should fuck her mom then.
what the fuck is your problem? bitch!! <b> int. sophie tromas mansion -- kitchen -- day </b> domino is loading her gun at the kitchen table as sophie serves breakfast. domino wolfs it down.

she's right... you lost your temper... and you started cursing like some ghetto skank. you lost all credibility right there!
that bitch called me a bitch.
ain't nobody gonna call me a bitch without some payback.
nobody.
i've already formulated a plan.
what?
my armored car business. we just signed a new insurance policy in nevada. there's a loophole.
there's always a loophole with you, claremont. your black ass is one big loophole. <b> int. vegas security lockdown -- [flash forward] night
are you aware that lateesha rodriguez has been running a counterfeit driver's license racket?

what was your business with lateesha that day?
we needed to verify some bond certificates for claremont. she pushes stuff through the system for us... helps us track down perps for a kick back. it's all legal. <b> int. mustang convertible -- [flashback] day </b>
<i>you drove lateesha's daughter to school... then dropped her off at the dmv. why?</i>
<i>her car was in the shop.</i>
this is drake bishop.
<i>mr. bishop... this is claremont williams. i own the williams brothers armored car service.</i>
what happened to my money, mr. williams? <b> int. claremont williams iii bond agency -- next </b> claremont sits behind his desk with his phone to his ear.
yesterday i received an e-mail from a source. in this e-mail were four social security numbers linked to the gentlemen who presented counterfeit california driver's licenses to my company late last night.
<i>well... i think that these are the gentlemen who robbed us. i'm also a bail bondsman out of los angeles. i can track down and deliver these crooks to you... for a small finder's fee of course.</i>
how much?
<i>$300,000.</i>
and if you can't deliver them?
<i>my theft insurance policy will have to fork over the ten million... but that will take six to eight months due to nevada state law.</i>  <i>but you should know sir... that i employ bounty hunters. my bounty hunters can find these thieves.</i>
<i>either this was some kind of set up... or the first ladies got scared... decided to pull out and cut their losses.</i>

twice a night, sometimes.
this could break new ground in terms of traditional host models. it's self-reflexive reality television.

we're covered on legal with that, right?
in theory.
fast and or furious.
but real. this is gritty. like cassavetes.

yep.
<i>deliver them to the needles dmv. sundown at the sam kinison monument.</i>

where are the bond certificates for the first ladies?
there are no bond certificates.
what do you mean? claremont didn't provide them?
no. what's the big deal?
something is going down. something bad.

where is domino?
she went up to her room.
what is it, choco?
<i>are you all right?</i>
i just charged $12.95 to our room for that movie. now i'll never know how the story ends.
don't fuck with me, ed. not you, not tonight.
oh! and another thing. i am a liar. a pathological liar. there was no day in danang, no multiple tours in nam. just lies to get laid, lies to get respect.  truth is... i'm scared shitless all the time.

this is your last chance. tell us everything you know.
do you want know the real reason why i became a bounty hunter?
no. please enlighten me.
i became a bounty hunter because of cunts like you.  i remember all the cunts in high school who were mean to me. eventually... they all grew up to be just like you. angry and bitter because they peaked early... and now they're stuck in some dead end marriage... or worse yet... an unfulfilling job that keeps them from meeting a man.
