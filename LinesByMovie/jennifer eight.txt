you can drive down there, sir ..
i'm already walking. where is it?
on the infill. the guy from l.a.'s just gone down there ..
he has? .. what's he doing here?
he was waiting for you, sir. wait- ed a good while. said he'd go down and take a look. i hope that's o.k.
damn a, it's o.k. with a bit of luck i'm goin home. what we got?
a derelict.
where do you fit in, trimble?
his father's the manager, sir. the kid was up there shooting vermin, and he found the body.
did you bring it with you?
i hope i'm not intruding?
be my guest. what you got?
old guy, offed himself with a knife. i can't find the knife.
i wonder what would make him do a thing like that?
don't annoy me, travis.
no, sir.
i dunno .. guess the dozer musta shifted him? you need some hands up here to look ..
you heard. look for the knife.
no, sir. i haven't started till monday. i'm a "tourist."
"welcome to eureka."
week or two.  musta been on the ker- osene.  stinks like a diesel engine.
fucken noddle's hanging off ..
mr blattis, of our local news- paper. you sure it's a suicide?
uh huh .. he's well rehearsed ..
what does that mean, sergeant?
cut your own throat, you're ner- vous about it, tend to hesitate. he's got three trial cuts, lower left side of the neck, before he works up courage for the big one.
alright, gentlemen, i'm gonna leave you. i got a couple of questions for the paper, serg- eant? mind if i swing by later, wring out a tea-bag with you?
my pleasure .. who's popeye?
your predecessor. he did- n't like to get outta bed. catch you later, freddy t ..
so what happened to the barbecues, and fishing?
watch my lips, coz you're not gonna believe this - <u>this</u> is a rare occurrence. we haven't had a body in eighteen months.
what about that kid, ross?
oh, shit. of course. the kid.  <u>travis</u>. find that kid and get the knife off him. he's gonna lie to you - but he's got it - so <u>get</u> it. well, go on, get on with it. whatta you staring at?
i think i found some- thing horrible, sir
whatta you mean, "horrible?"
i think i've found a hand.
what do you think?
i think you're here all day.
we give it one more hour. did the photographer do the dogs?
the <u>dogs</u>?
two dogs. he should do the dogs.
the coroner wants to know if we can release the derelict?
ask him.
yeah, he can go ...
think i'll lay down with him. only way i'll get outta here.
is this normal?
average rainfall, 48 inches. pisses down, october to june.
did he get you the job?
i think he would have if he could have - been trying to get me up here long enough - i think he may have bribed the old guy to retire ..
popeye wasn't old. younger than you.
did you find the knife, sergeant?
no .. but we have a theory ..
kid told me he didn't take it?
maybe he's lying to you?
interview over, blattis ...
c'mon, chief, if it's sensitive, tell me .. i'm not taking notes ..
.. we got a body part. we don't know what it is - probably some kind of hospital debris - we're gonna try and check it out. o.k. now you know as much as we do ..
grateful for your candor, sir.
then do me a favor, and keep this outta the newspaper - that dump serves a dozen different communities, we don't even know if it's ours? till we do i don't want no one worrying about ..
wasn't frozen, was it, sergeant?
come on, michael, outta here, the guys trying to move in. i told you what we know, something else, you- 'll be the first to hear about it ..
why did he ask if it was frozen?
that, i couldn't tell you .. and don't worry about anya this crap, by the time you're back it's gone ..
i'm not giving him <u>pizza</u>. i haven't seem him for a year? i'm gonna cook him a dinner.
dinner's another night, darlin .. this is a drive-by. i got an hour ..
bobby's out .. what's the hurry?
friday night at city hall. got a great chance to frighten the fat.
freddy's new obsession ..
who is who?
a professional, whining, con-person bitch with an ass the size of africa ..
so tonight she confesses?
tonight i'm feeling lucky ..
not for me ..
what d'you mean, i just opened it for you? this is <u>french</u> champagne.
no it isn't .. it's californian ..
even better.
not today .. i'm on a diet to- day .. i'll take a diet soda ..
since when did you drink diet soda?
how's the new residence?
o.k.
what does that mean?
not too good in daylight ..
c'mon, just shut your eyes until it's painted.  you're gonna love it. this is "god's country," john.
what time is it?
seven thirty-five .. here, "town gets top cop." i was gonna pin it to your wall.
why so coy about the word "frozen"?
because, don't get into it ...
there's nothing in the files?
watch my lips .. <u>don't get into it</u> ..
it's an "unsolved." they spent 500 thousand dollars & bought emselves a dead end - you might wanna check it with taylor, he worked the case.
i already did. what's his problem?
he thinks you stole his promotion.  what exactly you doin there, john?
it's a method for quitting smoking.
it's a technique i read about. if you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
because it's a ritual you gotta go through with. i'm down to 10.
you want my advice?
maybe?
find yourself a farmer's daughter with nice big fucking tits, and shake that "bye-bye." send it to sacramento, john .. i sniff grief ..
you gotta stop smoking ..
i <u>am</u> stopping smoking ...
i don't mean this "system" shit that keeps you sucking, i mean <u>stop</u> .. i was exactly like you are .. i used to wake in the night - heart going so hard i coulda made love with my left tit .. if i can stop, <u>you</u> can ..
how'd you do it, old man?
someone bet me a dollar ..
a dollar? .. not worth giving up for a dollar ..
what is that?
laser enhancement of the finger- tip .. it's really bothering me .. see these striations right here?  it's like she's always worrying the end of her finger? rubbing it with a thumb nail, or something?
how do you know her hair's black?
hair on her hand. plus jen- nifer had raven black hair.
what is all this jennifer stuff?
yes, sir, i think they maybe. i think "jennifer," and this lady got hit by the same guy?
i don't see that at all ..
i got four points of posit- ive comparison on the cut ..
yeah, that's all very inter- esting, but where's the body?
probably making him feel a bit antsy seein it back on the wall. he worked a lotta time on this.
i thought it was taylor's case?
sucked in officers from all over the county. and it was the worst six months this station ever had.
what do you want me to do, chief?
i'm not telling you what to do. what i will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
what do you mean?
worrying - clicking - picking - you may as well be back in los angeles.
what do you mean, ross?
why don't you dump it? mail it off. give the fucking f.b.i. a present?
why don't you dump the "fat lady?"
because i dislike her too much ..
o.k. and i'm not in love with this fukker? that's how i feel about him.
no you don't. that's how you <u>think</u> you feel about him. that's how you feel about <u>yourself</u>. you won't give yourself one-fucking-minute for <u>you</u>.
pig woman agreed to take a test.
i think i got something - twenty two years old, dark hair - study- ing mathematics -  - last seen <u>5 weeks ago</u> ..
as recent as we have .. what ex- actly is your interest in amber?
i'm afraid i can't give you an ans- wer to that, mr goodridge. as i ex- plained to your secretary, we're do- ing a lotta looking, but we're not even sure it's her we're lookin for ..
then what are you hoping i'm gon- na do? dissuade, or persuade you?
i was hopin since we spoke that you might have remembered something that would give us an idea where she is?
then you could have saved yourself a lot of driving, sergeant. what i said on the phone's the same as i'm saying now. i got no idea where amb- er is, or who it was took her there.
a blind girl can just walk out of here, and you don't know who with?
you find something curious in that?
yeah, i guess i do.
then let me put your mind at ease .. firstly, amber isn't "blind" - she has some useful vision - and second, this isn't a prison, it's a college of higher education - a severe vis- ual disability doesn't mean my stud- ents don't value their independence as much as anybody else - and amber was a very independent young woman - she decided to leave - so she left ..
and you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
no, sergeant, i got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. and i might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name i-won't-know-either ..
yes, sir.
as she's a member of my staff, may i ask what this is about?
well, apparently, she saw amber the weekend she left, & was briefly in the room with the guy she left with.
i see .. well, she's teaching an- other class at four .. i'd apprec- iate it if you don't detain her ..
where is everyone?
i dunno .. i guess this is staff side of the building?
what d'you wanna ask, mr ross?
i'm mr berlin.  mr ross is right here. and mr ross is maybe gonna take a few notes, if that's o.k.?  o.k. .. i'd like you to tell me in what ever way you want, what you can remember about the time you spent with amber on the aft- ernoon she left? take your time, and nothing's too trivial, o.k.
well, i think i told you on the phone .. i went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
what kind of friend? was he a boy friend? an old friend? new friend?
you must have some idea about him.
when we spoke on the phone, did you know i was blonde?
no.
why not? you heard my voice?
john? .. you never said that on the phone? .. what makes you think his name was john?
i don't know. i guess she must have called him john? i'm mak- ing tea. would you like some?
this looks promising .. i think this one could be it?
thank christ we got a witness.
let me just keep going a while. she might remember something?
<u>what</u>? she's <u>blind</u>, bro. you may as well ask one of these beethoven guys on the piano?
the elevator wasn't working?
no, it has a mind of its own.
can i see your hands?
my hands?
is there anything else you can tell me? anything about him or her? doesn't matter how small?
no. except he smoked. like you.
me?
yes, i could smell it on his breath, like i can on your's.
d'you have a dog? seeing eye dog?
no.
lotta scratch-marks on your door?
sometimes i look after friends dogs, if they go to dances, or something?
did amber have a dog?
yes.
what color was it?
i don't know.
had a seeing eye dog since she was eighteen .. didn't i tell you those dogs meant something ..
no, you didn't.
alright, i didn't, but i nearly did, and if i had i'd have been right .. i knew there was some- thing about that labrador, that dog was too good to be dead .. we gotta get back up that dump ..
no way .. not me, mister. i'm not going up there again. might find someone's prick in a hot-dog roll.
we're going.
forget it. they got stringent hyg- iene rules. he's long gone in lime.
maybe not? i'm feeling lucky ..
so am i. but where's my money?
don't start again. if you win a bet, you can't keep winning it ..
pay me, and i shut up.
i haven't got it.
then give me that zippo.
why?
i need some security. i don't trust you anymore.
i had one <u>puff</u> on a <u>pipe</u>.
i don't want excuses, i want that weird-looking stuff called "cash."
what do you want it for?
to throw out of the window.
what are you doing, ross? i've had that 15 years! ..
it's not your friend. it keeps you sucking. remem- ber the old bum's lungs?
i remember the old bastard's liver! i don't believe you did that. i had a great sent- imental attachment to that.
you want me to stop the car?
six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the m.o.'s exactly the same. dark hair. no hands. all shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
how come the f.b.i. don't put anya this together? they work- ed over "jennifer" for months?
they possibly did - but they nev- er had a head, so they never had a bullet - and they never got an i.d. - not on any of em - never bust a homicide unless you know who your victim is - we're the first to get a positive identity.
identity of whom? you got a girl, doesn't even have a driver's lic- ense? .. she's untraceable, john .. you need fifty detectives on this.
that's what i'm here for. i want you to come and see citrine with me?  he's not gonna here it from me but i know he'd listen to you.
listen to me saying what?
i wanna take that fucking blind in- stitute to pieces .. every address book, every phone call, everyone in and outta there in the last 5 years ..
for a <u>dead</u> <u>dog</u>?
we've fused into a major series, ross. this girl isn't the second victim. this is "jennifer <u>eight</u>."
that isn't what you said before.
i was wrong.
you believe me, don't you?
what does it matter what i bel- ieve? .. what you gotta worry about is what citrine believes ..
have you been here long?
no, just a minute or two .. i knocked on your door - no one home, so i followed the music ..
i'm sorry. i'll get my things.
no problem. i'm not in a hurry.
i suppose i'm the worst witness you've ever had?
i gotta admit, you're one of them. just wish i knew what you meant by a "hollow car?"
well, some cars sound fat and some cars sound thin, and this kind of car sounded "hollow" ..
if i came to the diner with you, would you bring me back?
of course i would ..
i'm sorry, someone slammed the door on me. i couldn't get out.
it was probably the wind.
what are you reading?
hamlet. have you read it?
no.
you should. it's wonderful.
are you wearing a uniform?
no.
oh.
well, i'm glad we got the conver- sational side of lunch over with.
i'm sorry .. i don't like sitting in the middle of a restaurant .. i feel like everyone's looking at me ..
there's no one "looking at you" .. there's hardly anyone in here. the only person looking at you, is me.
are you married?
was. but i don't like to talk about it.
you just asked me to ask you questions.
i know, but you pick on the one time in my life i like not to remember. i was in the bad lands. really not well. it's something that happens to a lota cops. we don't wanna talk about that.
"thoughts that lie too deep for tears."
yeah, that'll do .. is that "hamlet?"
no, wordsworth .. do you like poetry?
i don't know, i haven't read much. i don't think poetry's my kinda thing?
do you pray?
pray?
you said, you were in the bad lands?
no, i don't pray .. had a dream once, about god, just around the time i was getting well .. he was a nasty lookin little guy, moved into the apartment right on topa me .. i said, don't you listen to people's prayers?  he said, prayers? not often. they're junk mail.
sorry?
.. sorry your father, mother sis- ter, whatever .. i couldn't take another day of it .. come on, i'm gonna rob you of a cup of coffee ..
you're pushing this too hard. it's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? you must know that's the way this is going, john? there's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
then <u>where's the body</u>? .. where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
he <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. he never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. she's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
have you got a match on the bullet?
no.
have you got a print from the hand?
no, sir.
it could be anyone's hand. illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
it's <u>her</u> hand. <u>her</u> scars. <u>her</u> dog. her dog's shot. and she's missing.
she's <u>not</u> "missing." did she shout? did she scream? did he coerce her? <u>no</u>. she left of her own free will .. and if she gets on a plane and goes to peru with the prick, she's still not missing. you got no case, john.
if you're not gonna hear me, chief ..
i <u>have</u> heard you. you just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. you got this whole damned thing outta proportion. i don't know what you gotten used to in los angeles, but i don't believe there's a police chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
we have a multiple homicide, sir ..
we have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere - <u>and a bill</u> <u>for seventeen dollars for its wig</u>!
did he shut you down?
all but .. how <u>you</u> doing?
i dunno, i daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? we should be out chasing major violators ..
i wish he'd tell that to citrine.
did i say he did?
you looked like you did?
no, i think you'll find i looked like he could have? by accident even? he's up here spraying the scenery all day.
he didn't shoot it, ross. and no way by accident. there's a flash-burn. it was point-blank.
such a shame .. she's a really sweet kid ..
she's a doll. but i wish he hadn't brought her out here.
he's happy, darlin ..
i'm sure he is. but gettin in- to the "element" is a bad idea.
except for the hair color, she looks just like suzanne?
well, that's who she is. cept she can't run away.
you want something, darling?
i wouldn't mind another b.e.e.r.
she married some english prick.
he's not that bad of a guy ..?
got a handshake like a partially excited penis.
why's she blind, bro?
car accident.
she runs a kind of hair dress- ing and you know, beauty salon ..
have you known her long?
i was married to her sister ..
i know what you're like ..
how d'you know what i'm like?
ross told me.
really? what did he say?
he said you're quite chubby. and you have a nervous tick.
he said that? what else did he say?
just your age.
which is what?
fifty-seven .. i don't mind ..
i'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," john.
is that my punishment for embarrassing mr heineman?
don't underestimate me .. the mayor's pissed - but that's nothing to do with this - sit down - how many times have you been up at that institute?
three or four.
i'm talking, outside the girl?
once.
got a letter from this goodridge guy? says, you're upsetting his students?
that's bullshit,
he says, you freaked one of em out?  "asking a newly blind kid if he can 'see,' is both cruel, and dangerous" ..
i never asked if he could "see." i just asked one or two of the stud- ents if they remembered anything?
and did they?
no.
god, it pisses me off, ross.
no god, brother. if there was a god, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
hey, we're not talking "talk" tonight.
no one's gonna make that gent. six months investigation, & the nearest we got, we thought he was a sailor.
yeah, in and outta frisco on the big boats .. every lead we had went right out to sea .. night, night, freddy t .. john ..
how come he's suddenly so forth- coming? i'd like to kick him right in the ass. if he'd discussed it with me, i mighta gotten somewhere ..
stop it.
i never knew about the sailor the- ory, ross. he might have that one little thing i need in his files?
john, <u>stop</u> <u>it</u>. the case is on its ass, you're closed.  c'mon, let it go for once .. have a drink. c'mon, relax, drink your beer ..
you gotta stop calling los angeles .. you're dragging l.a. around with you like an addiction.  look at the shit you're putting yourself through? for what? for <u>nothing</u>, i know it, i been there. remember me? up to my asshole in anger, living off the vitamins in cigarettes?  if there's a body under the snow, <u>fuck</u> <u>it</u>. let somebody else worry about it. you gotta accept you stopped living in that world, & try and give yourself a break in this ..
just makes to so god damned mad ..
you're a fucking great policeman, but give yourself a break. you're here 5 minutes, you find yourself a fucking homicide? .. not many people could do that in a place like this .. and you gotta admit, there's a lot of shaky areas in this case? .. i mean, stop me if i'm going up the wrong nostril ..
she wasn't lying about the van.
alright, she wasn't lying about the van. but it could have been <u>any</u> van? any little foreign diesel? .. she's <u>blind</u>, bro .. it's sad .. she's pro- bably lonely, and you're a nice guy to have around .. but you're getting far too far into the element, brother ..
sure.
you don't need me to tell you what hap- pens when you get emotionally involved?
alright, enough, ross. you'll bring on my "nervous tick" ...
.. feel like i'm getting close to this guy .. and all the time, feel like i'm sharpening a pencil with a broken load .. i'm sorry, king j ..
what are you looking for?
vehicle references.
wrong cabinet.
i have to talk to you, helena.
i know.
you know? how do you know?
coz you hardly said a word since you got here. but you been thinking pretty loud ..
just easy on the words you're putting in my face, sergeant ..
whass going on here?
his blind friend got "attacked." angelo went up there, and some- how, it got itself in the paper.
<u>you</u> put it in there.
i may have said some- thing. i don't recall.
don't lie, taylor. i just had this blattis guy on the phone asking me for a comment - you gave him the whole damned case!
alright, i gave him the case? .. so the case is closed, so what?
so read it! you just hung a target around her neck!
bullshit.
don't you know nothing about this guy? he <u>reads</u> the newspapers. col- lects the cuttings. when are they gonna find her? now he's reading helena robertson's name, phrased like she's a fucking witness. you couldn't have done anything more stupid if you'd sat down & tried ..
hey, c'mon, country boys, let's all line up and hear the expert.
just walk away from me, taylor ..
you think you're the only guy ever worked a homicide? i was a big-city cop too. and i bust- ed the clock on fucken jennifer. i know more about this man than you'll over know - and that's how i know it ain't him - you- 're investigating a soap-opera ..
alright, guys. we stop this <u>now</u>.
he tells her, "bye-bye," and she gets "attacked." well, give me a fucking break! there <u>is</u> no "ser- ial killer." stick her name up in neon, there's still no serial kil- ler! and i ain't the only one say- ing it. everyone in this building is saying it. and i mean <u>everyone</u>.
shut up, king jay ..
no, c'mon, freddy, let's have this out & over. you know what everyone thinks? they think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. and no one's blaming you for it, i hear she's worth the flowers. but don't come in here get- ting holy over us. sure i put it in the paper. coz i wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. i don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.
you don't know what you done, taylor.
<u>if</u>, your friend from san diego was up here, and thought for <u>one</u> out of <u>two fucken seconds</u>, she was a danger to him, he'da taken her out weeks ago ..
i know what a "witness" is.
well, her, it ain't. that bitch is blind as a blonde fucken bat.
nothing you gotta say do i wanna hear right now. so save yourself saying it.
i'm not in here to apologize, john. i told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "good-bye, princess," & the same night she gets attacked? that's a tough one to swallow, bro?
i'm already familiar with taylor's opinion.
you don't really believe this?
<u>one hundred fucking per cent</u>! .. and you know why? coz i never told her good-bye. o.k.? is that good enough for the "committee?"
well .. i didn't know that ..
no .. you didn't know that ..
that's a very stupid question, ross.
i'm asking it.
how the hell do i know <u>who</u>? some jerk-off. some peeping-tom prick.
ease off, john ..
<u>i'm sick of this toy town shit</u>.
everything you say sounds reason- able. but there's also a reason- able explanation for the opposite.
don't give me that! <u>not another</u> <u>word</u>! when you had the fat lady in there, and i asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said <u>yes</u>. so as far as i was concerned, <u>she's ly-</u> <u>ing</u>. and if the king of fucking england had walked in & told me different, i wouldn't have bel- ieved him - because <u>you</u> told me ..
i dunno what i can do to help you?
i dunno what i'd do with your help. i've gotta take her out of there ..
what about citrine?
screw citrine. he can fire me.
has he got your aunt's address?
i don't think so .. he said the police had been calling .. want- ed to ask me some more questions ..
who?  probably angelo .. i'll take care of it .. don't worry, we- 're gonna find this guy, and everything'll be o.k. .. o.k.?
you're looking worried again, helena?
no i'm not.
you're looking more worried now than when you "decided to stop worrying"?
alright, i'm worried about christmas. i wish i hadn't told him i'd be back ..
can't thank you enough, ross ..
don't thank me. thank margie.
when did john divorce?
two or three years ago.
what was she like?
suzanne? very pretty. she was a semi- professional model. but a policeman's wife she wasn't. so one day, she just packed it and left. and his whole life went straight down the nearest toilet.
what does that mean?
you know, he crashed. he just couldn't come to terms with it .. john hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. every spare minute, he's driving down to san diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
you think he still loves her?
think he still thinks about her. but not like then. then was an obsession.
i haven't worn heels since i was 16. i don't think i could walk in these?
sure you can. anyway, parties are all about standing still ..
you think john would like it?
i think john, would <u>love</u> it ...
yeah .. i guess she's in the kit- chen .. we got a so-called prof- essional cook out there having a nervous breakdown over a turkey ..
are you sure you didn't call?
you got a quiet phone somewhere?
hey, john, don't start getting antsy over this tonight. it may well have been the local cops?
that's just what i wanna find out.
how you doing on those shoes?
don't mix very well with beer.
jesus. what are you doin?
i spose i'm drinking myself to sleep. it's helena's christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
what exactly you doing, john?
i'm going up to the institute.
now?
this "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over christmas.
listen, you don't havta come?
hey ..
where's your watch?
i guess by the bed.
it's twenty of three.
bull shit .. i'm in my prime ..
bits.
what d'you mean, "bits."
policemen's bodies age at diff- erent rates. look at me. gut in its fifties. balls in their six- ties. and feet in their eighties ..
<u>hit those wipers, ross</u>.

you ain't going in alone?
that's a liability, ross. i don't want you hanging on to my shirt. anyone but me comes down these stairs, take em out but try and keep him alive. i want this bastard living ..

don't say that. don't you <u>dare</u> say that .. <u>i believe you</u>  ..
i know you're trying to help me, but you don't understand.
<u>then explain it to me</u>. i got enough darkness, don't i?
the man who killed amber is a psychopath. he was up at the in- stitute to <u>kill you</u> - he don't wanna kill rose - he was there to <u>kill you</u> - that's the truth - and i didn't wanna tell it to you - but that's the reason i want you to stay at margie's - coz i can't protect you here ..
why does he want to kill me?
coz he thinks you're a witness.
i can't identify him ..
he don't know that. i didn't.
then why didn't he kill me?
he doesn't need my help.
i know about alcohol, john.
you do?
i'm blind because my father drank.
he's offerin you a deal? why don't you take it ..
he ain't offerin me shit.
you don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
i wanna be near you ...
i think they're gonna arrest me.
i don't want them to arrest you.
it's not as bad as it sounds .. they can't refuse me bail. raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is ..
i've told you the truth. it isn't me .. i've never call- ed ross "freddy" in my life ..
i've heard you call him freddy.
you <u>haven't</u>. and you got no voice in here, taylor, <u>so keep it shut</u>.
as i said, sergeant, you nearly ran into <u>me</u>? what's the problem?
i'm afraid it's the "van" again.
the van?
is it your vehicle?
no, my mother's .. you better stop in .. i'm just here to feed the cat.
i'm sorry to worry you with this, but we had a real serious robbery, and we- 're chasing a white v.w. van? you guy came up an the computer, so as a matt- er of routine we have to check. could you tell me who's driven it recently?
only me and mom ..
how about any guys on your staff?
we only got one .. he doesn't drive.
i'll sign anything you want. <u>please</u>. bring here her .. <u>i want helena here</u> ..
you ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
i am calm .. <u>i am calm</u> ..
