"what is unusual about miss carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  she has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... i can not ready anymore.
"and her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  so all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride is not honeymooning with las vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground"  holy moly.
you tell maggie.
no, you tell her.
no, no.  you are her best friend.
no.
you know, it is just possible that she has not read this yet.
yeah.
maybe she has not read the paper...
so -- mag -- you have seen this, huh?
yes, I have seen it.  and i have to say it is the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
fully.  i like her.  she has wit.
i left four messages.  you do not return my calls.
so?  i never returned your calls, even when we were married.  and what is fisher doing here anyway?
ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
since when does ellie need moral supp--
-- it is for you, ike.
what?
journalism lesson number one.  if you fabricate your facts, you get fired.
lesson number two.  never work for your former spouse.
that is not nothing to do with it.  you cooked this story up and you know it.
i did not cook up a story.  i had a source.
someone reliable, I am sure.  a booze- hound in a bar?
in vino veritas.
do not knock drunk guys in bars.  drunk guys in bars are good.  it means they are not driving.
no, that is what makes you unemployed.
i merely write the stuff.  you are the one that serves it up.
lawyers.  i do not know, ellie -- firing me is going to be very tough on you.  it is going to be hard to get over.  there will be therapy bills for you.
i already made an appointment for later today.
see?  you want custody of my job? ... why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I have served my time?
I am sorry, ike.  this is permanent.
ike, i really liked the runaway bride piece, and since i do freelance stuff for g.q., I am in a different position now...
what are you trying to say to me, fish?
vindication.  how would you like to get some?  a chance to prove that, though your facts were not entirely straight, your theory was correct.
the real story on miss carpenter.
all the gory details.
the anatomy of the black widow spider of maryland.
it would not be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
this is good.  it is a good story, fish.
if she runs, then it is a cover story. all true.  all accurate.
okay, you were right.  i hated my column, but i can do this assignment.
then you have got it.  if you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you will have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
"paid vindication"  that is what i call justice.
justice, yes.  paid, i do not know. they like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
but I will get my normal fee, right?
do not say "spec" like it is a dirty word. nobody ever paid shakespeare to write a play!  plato never got a book advance...
oh yeah!  i happen to know from reliable sources that nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
that is it.  back to obedience school.
okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
you are a goddess!
i did not even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
stop it.  when you talk like that, i get turned on and it frightens me.
hello.  I am looking for maggie carpenter.  there was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
are you a reporter?
what?
it is been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview maggie.
about her upcoming wedding and all.
no, about her getting that asshole from new york fired.
i am just such a reporter.  and you are?
peggy phleming.  not the ice skater.
and you are?
looking for maggie.
yep.  maggie -- someone to see you.
reporter?
yup!
i hope you have a different angle. it is pretty much all been covered.
originality is my speciality.
excellent.
hold on -- nobody interviews maggie in here unless they are getting haircut.
she is the boss.
sorry, no.  i just got one.
excuse me, sir.  i have an actual fact for you.
yes, mrs. pressman.
it is her fourth time to the altar, you know.  not seven like they said.
i know.  tell me something.  do you think she is going to make it all the way this time?
I am not sure.  mr. schullian runs the newsstand, he is our local bookie, you know, he is giving eight to one odds she won't.  he says she is so famous now, maybe vegas will give odds on her.  I am going to wait to hear what the pros say.
good fact.  well, you let me know.
oh, i will.
well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  you know, get all that city grit out of it.
you will answer my questions?
getting nervous?
nervous?  not at all!  no.  I have never been more certain in my life.  except -- i am having all kinds of weird dreams.
weird dreams?  you are going to tell me about them?
yes.
i think you would look good in red.
no, she is talking about your hair.
I am not here to make you feel bad.  I am here for vindication.  in my heart...
you have one?
did something happen to make you care about reality?
yes.  conviction.  conviction that I am onto the truth.  you are going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three.  you are going to run again.  and I am not leaving until you do.
you are going to be very disappointed.
we will see.
I would love to stay and chat, but I have got to get back to work.  i still have my job.
they made me put my hat back on.
oh, yeah.  scared the hell out of skipper.
gee, i hope they do not have a fight out there.  you do not think they will call it off...?
well, wedding cake freezes.  this we know.
you know, your daughter seems...
like her mother.
ah, beautiful.  i just can not see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
dad's fishing trip, grandma's knee operation, grandma's birthday...
got to tell you this about my daughter. my daughter makes real good time, even in a long dress and heels.  maggie may not be hale's longest running joke, but she certainly is the fastest.
so I have come to see it as a bonus, really, that we have been able to plan, and pay for, so many weddings.
not this one.  this one's on me.
that is fair.
despite what you think, i do not do it on purpose.  and i have no intention of doing it again.
ahh.
I am the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  you could say or you can quote me, I am a glass half full king of guy.
everest.  is that right?
twice...
really?
without oxygen...
how romantic.
we think so.
nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two sherpas and a yak.
yes, i am.  and who are you?
betty trout.  five dollars.
oh, betty.  i take it you are going to be making the wedding cake and they say you are throwing --
-- the luau for maggie.
grandma made me the cutest outfit.  i can not wait to show it to you.
a pre-wedding luau?
your two cinnamon rolls.
bye, betty.  thanks.
what is he up to now?
ike just came by to check out the team.
bob -- are you making friends with this man?
I am just bragging about how great you are.  I am the luckiest man alive.
see you at the wedding.
you bet ya, coach.
at the wedding?  you invite him?  bob, do not you realize he is writing another article about me?
sure i do.  but the bet defense is a good offense, right?  you are not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
you do not understand this guy.
let him come to the wedding.  you are not running, right?  say it. "i'm not..."
I am not running.
so if you are not running and ike graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  all we are doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
I have got news for you.  no amount of sugar and water is going to turn like graham into something you want to take on a picnic.
actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question.  the rest were not so bad.
what?  you talked to him!  did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
yes, yes, I am sure i only did you good, maggie.
what did he ask?
only respectful things.  what did we have in common back then... what kind of music did you like... did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...
and what did you say?
how could i be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as god intended?
good one!  thanks.
it happens to be how i feel.
god... of course.  I am sorry -- i mean, i'm...  brian -- I have got to go.  the man's a lunatic, but i know exactly where he is going next.
god bless you, maggie.
he wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
weird.  like after all those years you would remem--
I am really sorry that i hurt you, brian.
I am happy here, where I am supposed to be.  but if you ever become a catholic, may i ask you a favor, maggie?
of course.
could your confess to father patrick from now on?
of course.
give me that!
but the most interesting thing here is that i do not see the rose tattoo that I have heard about on your back.
look, look, man.  i think the man is heartbroken.
he is not!
okay, he is on base.  can we talk about my life now?  -- ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that i was never serious about gill, blah blah.  he is totally out to get me.
for what reason?  some personal satisfaction?
that is what he says, but if he thinks that i do not realize he is writing another article, then he is an idiot.
it is probably because you got him fired.
ya think?
not that he does not deserve to get fired... look!  cory's going for second!... sneaky!
there he is.  snoop doggy-dogg.
where?
over there.  ten o'clock.  he is talking to our little dennis.  dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
he looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  he is an attractive man.
have you listened to his morning show, "wake up with ballplayer"?
not yet.  i had a phlemless morning.  i hear he is a pretty good ballplayer.
this game is pretty important to him. he made all-stars in high school, you know.
that must have made you proud.
it is nice that they are still friends.
oh, sure.  that was a long time ago. see, she is not a man-hater at all. she is very supportive of men...
you have been here for three minutes. what did you do to her?
you can turn that finger around.
you misinterpret everything.  we have all been friends our whole lives.  but that is the types of relationship you would not understand.
obviously, I am not the only one who does not understand it.  the uss maggie leaves quite a wake... excuse me.
good morning to you, too.  you look good.
thank you.  do you think i flirt with cory?
yes.
i know.  i think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
on anything male that moves?  as opposed to anything male that does not move?
I am going to kill myself.
why?
because you think I am all like... "hey man, check me out".
no, i do not think you are like, "i'm charming and mysterious in a way that even i do not understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  very hard to compete with.  especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
but you have not lost your mystery! you are very mysterious!
no.  I am weird.  weird and mysterious are two different things.
but I am weird.
no.  you are quirky.  quirky and weird are two different things.
peggy, there is distinct possibility that i might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.  despite that, i love you and i can promise that i will no longer flirt with cory, and i beg your forgiveness.
I am not worried about you and cory or cory and me or even that you are irreversibly screwed up.  but, maggie, you have been like this since we were kids.  and i think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it is time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like bob, if he is the one.
i think you are right.  is there anything i can do to make it up to you?
something that brings warmth to my heart.  duckbill platypus.
it is only funny at camp birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. it is not anymore.
you are right.  it is not funny now. maybe we both grew up.
thanks.  will you fix my hair?
i take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
how do i do it?  I am not that beautiful.
you are welcome.  your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. you must be very proud.
I am not a boastful man.  what is your point?
my point is that one again, you are getting it all wrong.  that will not improve your reputation any, and it is not very flattering to me either.  so, I am going to give you a chance to write the truth.
really.
my magazine does not pay because for stories.  it is not what you call ethical.
oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  actually, i meant you.  you probably got severance or expenses or both.  I will take your check. no credit cards.
you have seen the post-its.  I have already got more juicy material than i need. why should i pay you dollar one?
because i think you are writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
too much.
seven-fifty.
five hundred.
six-fifty.
done.
it is a birthday present for my cousin. put your finger in.
cindy the manicurist.
i think so.
i like it.  this whole thing is pretty incredible.  i think you could probably sell this lamp idea in new york.
maybe someday.
you afraid to try?
no, I am not afraid.  just... maybe someday.
well, I am impressed.  absolutely incredible.  i did not expect pink and lacy, but this is not exactly a woman's room.
what an incredible chauvinistic observation.
always a mood killer.
still sweet.
it is a little "silence of the lambs" for me.  i can not believe you waited for the wedding to run.
he is an entomologist!  i thought it was very unique.
it was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  cal ripken even applauded.
highly suspect.
what do you mean?  it was incredibly romantic!
maybe it is just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it does not ring true.
I am a work in progress.
so?  is that what you said to her?
no.  i think i said something eloquent like, "so, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  what do you think?"
now that is romantic.  a proposal like that and you did not find eternal bliss? what went wrong?
i do not know.
you do not know.
no.
maybe you should ask her some time. ever thought of that?
even with everything that is happened I have still never been married and i still deserve a beautiful dress.
agreed.
you look... uh... you look fine.
fine.  the newspaper's upside down. that is better than fine.
bob will be very happy.
I will have the same.
of course.
what was that?  i can not order  my eggs without sarcasm?
right.
i lead maggie through a visualization exercise.  all the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift.
tell me.  when you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
you know, there is no...
well, I am off.  a reporter's work is never done.  mrs. pressman, thank you.
tootaloo.
ike... hi, grandma.
gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
oh, my god -- it is miles davis.  this is "king of blue"!  this is the original recording.  hard to find in good condition.  where did you find this?
it was in the attic.  it was jus sitting there gathering dust.
it is valuable.  hang onto it.
no.  you take it.
hmmm... figuring out what kind of music i like and then finding me a rare album. you are not trying to soften me up, are you?
no -- I am cleaning an attic.  i would not attempt the impossible.
I am not exactly having fun, either... steady.
good boy, port hole.
his name is skipper, dad... steady.
i changed it.  see you later, mr. travis.  that guy has a problem... maggie, you can run everyone's life but your own.
watch your leg, dad.  I am so tired of this.
why do not you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I will take you for a ride. then we will come back for him.  keep an eye on him.
your filter's clogged.  this takes unleaded.
can you fix it?
first i have to find some tools.  i need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
of what?
wrenches.  my dad's going to love that one.
kind of isolated.
yeah.  it is kind of nice.
no.  but i think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. attraction is very misleading.  and if it is mutual, it is well, terribly distracting.
yes it is.  and it does not mean anything.
yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... negative attention is attention. like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that is negative attention.
this is about her negative attention, not mine.  did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
no, I am paying for the dress.  do you think she is still going to run?
i do not know.
look -- I will be in there later today. I will come by and tell you all about it.
you are coming here?
yeah.
then come for dinner.
okay, we will order out.
order out like a philistine, when you got the galloping gourmet here?...
get this man a kamikaze.
splendid dissection of maggie carpenter, very professional job.
you could have told me you were fiance number three.
and end up in the papers?  I have been humiliated enough already to last a lifetime, thank you.  I am sorry she got you canned.
thanks.
she is a cacophony of contradictions.
well, I am writing another article on the cacophony.
ah, can not stay away from her, can you? like a moth to a flame.
guess you would know about that.  you are an entomologist, right?  how is business?
not bad.  i was traveling around studying the reproductive and migratory patterns of locusts when maggie met me.
neuter a locust, feed the world.
same as you said.  what did you call her?  a "man-eater", "a devouring death goddess."
i do not think that is why she ran.
why do you think she ran?
i do not know.  I am working on it.  i was on the wrong track.
and you defending her?
no.  i call it like i see it.  I am a journalist.  I am a truth teller.
unbelievable, she got to you.
oh, please!
overpriced nice apartment and chinese takeout.  that is new york living.
... just call me when you have it.  ike, how is the story coming?  is she a man-eater?
or a vegetarian?
or does she pick "ngb's" -- "nice guys, but..."  nice guys, but I am cheap. nice guys, but he lives with his mom... nice guys, but he just out of prison.
no... they are interesting guys.  each one of these guys has something going for him.  i mean, one's been up everest. another's become a priest.  one's a pretty good guitar player.  and this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
whoa, ike.  getting a complex, buddy?
fisher, let him talk.
but one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they did not see her.  and she never showed up so they could not see her. it is a very symbolic thing happening. she becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
is that what i did to you?  is that what happened?  did i just not see you?
no.  no, you didn't.
well -- I am sorry, I am really sorry, ellie.
I am sorry, too.  wow.  that only took us between years to say.
lighten up, wahine.
lighten up, what?
this party is for you and bob.  get your mind off the reporter.
i have not seen him in twenty-four hours. it just gives me the creeps a little bit. I would feel better if i knew where he was.
would it?
where did you disappear to?
missed me bad, huh?
i do not know, give me a minute.  are you all right with this?
excuse me?
are you all right with this?  you think this is funny?
yes.
i do not and i do not think you should...
I am the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
you humiliated me!
no, maggie, i defended you. humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  it is the theme of this party.
i had it under control.  now they feel sorry for me.
well, they should.  because they are about to watch you hang yourself again.
it is fun!  it is high.
or the sexual habits of locusts?
that was very interesting research george was doing!
what kind of dead head gets a temporary tattoo?
i already explained about that.
and where you ever really going to run the leper colony in molokai?
brian told you that?
or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
every one of those times i was being supportive.  something you will not understand.
supportive?  you were not being supportive.  you were being scared. just like now.  you are the most lost woman i have ever laid eyes on.
lost!
that is right.  you are so lost you do not even know how you like your eggs.
what!?
with the priest, you liked them scrambled.  with the dead head, fried. with the bug guy, poached.  now it is egg whites only, thank you very much.
that is called changing your mind.
no, that is called not having a mind of your own.  what are you doing, maggie? you really want to let that man drag you up annapuma on your honeymoon?  you do not want to climb annapuma.
yes i do!
no you don't.  you want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. you want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  you want a man to wake you up at dawn because he is burning to talk to you and he can not wait another minute to find out what you will say.  am i right?
yes.
let me take you back inside, okay?
tell me, why does maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  she is already done this.
bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
no.  no -- actually, let's make ike the pastor.
I would rather not.
come on, it will give you a great view. it is perfect.  hey.
he is going to be the pastor?
yep.  i want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
what happened at the luau?
... i do not even want to talk about the luau.  what is this?
it is for the bell.
bob's in a hurry.
do not be nervous, maggie.  let us visualize.  remember what bob said? "be the ball."
"sink the putt."
"make the shot."
"nothing but net."
"never say die."
at this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
hold it!  hold it!  i think we are taking this too fast.
I am sorry, bob.  she kissed me back.
i kissed him back.
about a minute...?
a little longer for me.
really?
what do you expect me to say to this?
how about -- "i hope you will be very happy together"?
okay.  so... what, uh... what just happened?  just now?  jus then?  in there?
i do not know.  i, uh -- i frankly do not even want to talk about it.
me, either.
i love you.  i love you.
i love you, too.
to who?  are you asking me?
me?
yes, you!
well, you do have the dress.
and the church.
and the wedding date.  there is the two of us.  so, you think... maybe... you have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
I am okay with that.
so am i.
so, we'll...
i love his eyes.  i just believe they are listening to you.
his hair... any color.
grandma!
see, this is a mature relationship. she is really found it.
he is not coming.  watch.  he is not coming.
no, no.  i saw eight geese flying in a "v".
you and your lucky geese.  you always see geese.
not eight...
and in a "v".
eight is good... "v" could be victory.
rub your ears.
yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. cory does that to me when i hyperventilate.
we do it to our dog.
it is hurting.
we will rub.
I will get the dress.
he is here!... he is here!
it is okay.  there is no microphone. you are no fun.
no, I am not.
of course we are.  of course.
then you will be my best man.
well, I am good, i do not know if I am best.
go talk to the pastor and he will tell you what to do.  and someone will tell me what to do.
you look awful.
thank you.
really?
i did not want to find out i was not for her in the fourth quarter.
got any last minute advice?
maintain eye contact.
i have no idea what I am doing.
your job is... the ring.  do you have the ring?!
i just found out I am best man!  I am lucky i have a suit... what is wrong?
you should thank lou and i for the wedding car -- a '63 buick.
thank you.
oh, come on.  you are practically family.
I am really rooting for this one.
thank you, dad.
let's go.
no sauntering down the aisle.  just make time.  let's just get there.
look, he is running after her.
look, he is in pretty good shape.
poor ike.
maggie!
where do you think she is going?
you okay?  I am closing.
I am just finishing up, too.
want to go to butch's for a drink or something?
no, I am just going to head home.
okay.
what are you talking about?
wedding.  wedding.  you just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
thank you.  you still think that he was....
quick.  very quick.
what?
just stop it.  do not say another word like that.
maggie, it is just a joke...
no.  it is my life.
a harmless joke.
no, it is humiliating and you have been doing it since i was a kid.  i do not like it.  stop.  you may not like having a daughter with problems.  but guess what?  i do not like having a father who is drunk all the time.  I will eat in my room.
I have been making friends with your cat.  is it okay that I am here?
i do not have much choice in the matter now, do i?  but i can not speak for italics.  traitor!
livid is good.  so what is it, maggie? you here on business?  i saw your lamps. they are terrific.
it is something I have always wanted to do.
you actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  so, what are you doing here?
i wanted to talk to you about why i run or ride away from things.
does it matter?
i think so... when i was walking down the aisle?  i was  walking toward somebody who did not have any idea who i really was.  and it was only half the other person's fault, because i had done everything to convince him that i was exactly what he wanted.  so it was good that i did not go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
yes, i did.
i didn't.  and you being the one at the end of the aisle did not just fix that.
used?
they are mine.  I am turning in my running shoes to you.
this is getting serious.
you were not.
i was, because if you said "yes" right away, i would not get to say this next part.  and I have been practicing it.  ready?
I am listening.
"i guarantee that we will have tough times.  i guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. but i also guarantee that if i do not ask you to be mine, I will regret it for the rest of my life. because i know in my heart -- you are the only one for me".
pretty good speech, maggie.
i borrowed it from this guy i know. so?
