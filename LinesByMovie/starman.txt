benny, god, take it easy...
i don't want to scare them away.
right in line with that burning tree.
i don't see anything.
it's there. the fog's thicker now, but it's there. what do you think started those fires?
benny, there's nothing there.
there is. they came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
flew?! oh, come on benny...
what did i tell you?
probably kids.
don't you think you should call a backup?
no, we can handle this.
mike, call for back-up.  benny, you all right?
i don't think so...
benny, this is me. i'm going to take a look.
this has always been my favorite time of day.
very beautiful country up here...
any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
not on the landscape. we're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
can you see under the faceplate?
no.
there's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
wait'll you see it.
we had a flight of f16's play tag with the spaceship over michigan for an hour. then it shot straight up and disappeared.
was there visual contact?
no, sir. radar.
it could have been anything.
after i called in, i had a chance to sit down with the three locals. they swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... it might be alive.
people have made mistakes in these situations before.
i've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, mr. shermin. this one's real. we have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. we've been visited. it's finally happened and the sooner washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be.
oh, jesus.
we better get it into the box. come on...
is it for real?
get fox.
it's real, george.
there's no mistake? you're absolutely sure?
i saw it with my own eyes. we've killed an extraterrestrial and...
is there any possibility that it's a hoax? could you be mistaken?
none. and there's another one in the area that's alive. i don't know if it's the only one. i don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
get the body out of there. load it on the air force chopper and get it to wright patterson. they'll take it from there... we didn't expect this, shermin.
neither did i.
we're going... damn!  we'll tell the press that there was an accident. chemical warfare spill. that cover cannot be violated in any way. understand me, shermin?
major bell here, sir. we have to tell these people that we're friendly. that this whole thing was a mistake. is anyone trying to contact the ship?
shermin, i want you and bell to start looking for the one on the ground.
we'll need a lot of help, george. you could hide an army up here.
i'm going to the white house right now. i'll try and get you everything you need.
wait, wait... what are my orders if we find this thing?
contain it and get back to me.
what do you mean by 'contain?'
aghh... i'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
i wouldn't worry about it... there might not be any little league tomorrow.
i'm telling you they're probably friendly.
then why did they try and sneak in the back door? tell me that. why didn't they contact us first and say...
this is crazy. what were we going to do if that had been the ship? we have two thirty calibre machine guns, three m16's and some handguns.
give it a rest, lyman.
that's because the ones that were hurt, died. they couldn't talk to you.
any reports about monsters, people in halloween masks, anything like that?
recognize this?
it's a copy of the plaque nasa sent into space on the pioneer probes.
houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
they must have picked it up in space.
then it's not an accident that they found us.
we don't think that's necessarily bad. at least it's a point of contact.
not necessarily bad! if they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
we'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
that's not going to happen, george, unless you get us the help you promised us.
we've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
don't let them do it this way, george. it's too important. we can't find this thing alone.
you have to. we're trying to contact the ship. if we do, i'll let you know immediately. good luck.
please...
don't... don't do this... please...
please.
why are you doing this to me? i'll give you whatever...
please...
which way do you want to go?
what?
what.
ah... no...
ah no.
steering wheel...

gear shift.
gear shift.
dashboard.

eh... police.

help me!!
you could have killed us both!!
he's kidnapping me!!!
jesus christ!! you crazy people...
call the police!!
hey buddy... let her go...
help me!!!
hey, she doesn't want to go with you. come on.
oh god, man... don't shoot me... my mistake... i'm sorry...
he doesn't understand... just walk away...
there's nothing... no reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... seems like a totally isolated incident.
it was only an accident that we discovered them.
i know, but...
you married, major?
twenty-eight years.
to the same woman?
yes.
i tried it once... fourteen years ago... 'i was a lousy husband and a worse father. the only thing i'm good at is this... at least until yesterday.
how would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
it was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
listen to this.  a woman was kidnapped in eau claire this morning. when a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
it was a man though... right?
the police think he was high on drugs...
nothing up there... the grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
it was the husband. the police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
i told you...
judy, that's stupid.
well, maybe these men won't think so. we were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. it made me so nervous i went into the kitchen for something to eat. i happened to look out the window and there was scott haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling jenny down the walk to the car.
you know that's impossible!
i know what i saw. i've seen him enough times.
scott haydn is dead. he died about three months ago. we went to the funeral.
what?
x...
george, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
when can we expect containment?
well, we're in pursuit of a green mustang...
it's in a green mustang?
yes. it's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere.
why did you let it get into a populated area?
it's taken on a disguise.
clarify that.
it's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
the extraterrestrial now looks like this.
oh shit!!!
money.
money.
mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... jennyhaydn... money?
we're going to have to stop for gas soon.
what?
smile.
smile... good?
yes.
what?!
minneapolis.
minneapolis... minneapolis...
what are you doing?
minneapolis... good.
you're full of tricks, aren't you?
no gas.
no gas.
this car runs on gas.
no gas... car dead.  we need gas. i don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
gas good?
yes. very good.
go.
it's closed... closed. we need one that's open.
closed?
you'll see.
what?
not what. who. what is for things.  what? what? what? what? for people you use who. who is he?  who is she?  who are you?  who am i?
who is he? who is she? who are you? who am i?  who are you?
i am jenny haydn.
jennyhaydn.
who are you?
i am...
that's a big help. where are you from?
from?
are you from up there? space?
space?
up there... i... eh... can't explain...  but that's the only place you could be from.
gas.
closed.
no gas.
i know.
who?
my... husband.
i am husband?
no. i don't know what you are, but you're not scott.
shit.
shit?
no, no... don't say that. bad word.
shit... shit... what shit?
stop!! enough!! jesus! you're worse than a parrot!!
who?
attendant. he'll give us gas. put the gun down. under the seat. under the seat...
no.
oh god! you're going to get us both killed. okay... in your pocket...
in your pocket, please...
you. mouth closed.
okay.
satisfied? now get out. out.
no.
money.
yes.
what?
candy.
what is...  ...coke?
a drink.
i...
you want to try it?
i want to try it.
this stuff could kill...  be my guest.
what's the matter?
shit!
horses.
horses.
what?
music.
you sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
i'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
i don't like it, george...
dammit shermin. earlier you were asking for help. what's changed?
it's messy... the thing's got a gun... we're just asking for somebody to get killed...
we don't know what else to do. we need results.
you'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... okay.
i'm gonna be here if you need anything.
they're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
save us all a lot of trouble.
jesus lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
bullshit!
you have no conception of this, do you?
you jerk! you look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. you know what's gonna come out of this... the end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. we could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. don't you see that? are you too stupid to see that?
good... it looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so i think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
did your people have any contingencies rehearsed?
that was a red light!! i told you you have to stop at a red light!!
it was yellow.
you didn't even see it.
i will see it next time.
you better.
why are you going here? what is here?
my...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
when do you have to be here?
i do not understand.
how will i do this one?...
sun...
yes.
sun... day. no sun... night. you understand?
yes. day... night.
how many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
three nights... two days.
that's not much time. i'll just slow you down. i have to sleep. i'm very tired. and i have to wash and eat. you don't...
i need you.
i won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. i promise. you'll keep...
no.
you'll keep the car. i'll take a bus...  am i going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
no.
then let me go. you don't need me.
no.
i feel like i'm going crazy here. you're scott. but he's dead. i don't know what's real anymore. i can't be here with you.
do you understand what i'm saying to you? you can keep the car.  that should be enough for gas from here to there. please let me go.
when we get here.
gate three. it's boarding now.
thank you.
have a nice trip.
the closest i was able to get you was lathrop wells...
is that a baby?
yes.
a baby is a new person?
eh... yes...
do you have a baby?
no... the closest...
why?
i'd love to have a baby. but i can't...
why?
i can't... forget the baby. okay? the closest i was able to get you was lathrop wells. you'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
but i must go here.
i know that. but the buses don't go there.
what is hitchhike?
that's easy. i'll explain that in a minute. this is your ticket. when you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. you will ride to omaha. when you get to omaha, ask the driver. 'salt lake city, please. i do not speak english.'
say it.
'salt lake city, please. i do not speak english.'
the driver will...
but i speak english.
will you please do it my way? you'll get into trouble if you don't. if anybody talks to you, tell them... i do not speak english.
i do not speak english.
right. in omaha the driver will put you on the bus for salt lake city and the new driver will take...  ...this part. when you get to salt lake city, ask the driver, 'las vegas, please'...
'las vegas, please. i do not speak english.' what is hitchhike?
you want this ticket?
yes.
then don't be smart.
'lathrop wells, please. i do not speak english.'
you keep this. now this is hitch- hike...  you stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? and you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. when you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...
your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
the car will stop?
not every car, but... a car will stop... maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen...
when do i get to lathrop wells?
tomorrow morning. start hitch-hiking right away and...
don't worry. they're not going to hurt you. come on.  only show this to the driver. nobody else. and don't lose it.
can i have the gun?
no.
don't be afraid. do what i told you and you'll be okay.
yes.
well... i'm going to go now.
go?
yes. i have a long ride ahead of me...  goodbye.
goodbye.
jennyhaydn.
yes?
please stay.
goodbye.
what?
it's a kiss...  goodbye...
what happened?
i was afraid.
is there a reward in this?
huh?... eh... no, there isn't
because i'm the one who called the police, you know.
yeah, thanks. we appreciate that.
hey, it's none of my business why you're chasing a retard... you want my opinion, it's the girl. she had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
you saw that?
hey... he didn't look like no big time criminal to me.
eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... but that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
i wouldn't think so.
that's what i thought. so remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
we will.  something's wrong here. she's helping him now.
i know. she bought him a ticket for lathrop wells and put him on the bus. he didn't stay on though and they drove off together.
doesn't make sense.
maybe he's turned her into one of them. they enter the crowd around the helicopter.
why did your ship land on this planet... on earth?
it was a mistake.
you thought we were a different planet?!
no. my ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
stars... when a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
we were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. my... eh... we kidnapped it. on it there was a map that said how to come to earth. this was very important. before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
you did? that's funny. so did we.
yes?
yes.
we told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. just to look from up there. we came and... the driver of my ship...
the captain...
the captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from earth to take home. the police came and shot at us. one of the people from my ship was killed.
oh, that's terrible. i'm sorry. was he a good friend?
i don't understand 'friend.'
a friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
he was a good friend... the captain took the ship away fast and i was not in the ship.
the police shouldn't have started shooting. but you can hardly blame them. you surprised them. they didn't know you were up there. when they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
i understand.
sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
what is hell?
it's bad.
he will.
what are you doing?
are you my friend?
yes.
i am your friend.
nobody knows.
why?
i don't know.
i like this music.
i've noticed... do you understand what they're saying?
not all... but it feels like a kiss.
do you have music up there?
yes.
i'd like to hear it. can you sing something?
i do not want to.
don't be afraid... i'd really like to hear it.
i am not a good singer.
that was beautiful.
you liked my singing?
yes. sing some more.
what can i do for you folks?
how much are your rooms?
thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two.
you have one with two beds?
sure.
i'll take that.
fill this out.  will this be cash or credit card?
credit card.
i'll have to run your card off now.
we're only going to be here a few hours...
it's still the full price.
put that back.
but i have never seen this before. i am not complete.
you shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. it's bad for you.
on the radio they say it's good.
hurry up.
the machine gave me two. should i put one back?
no. get in.
you can have one.
i'm not sleepy anymore. let's drive for a little while longer.
are you angry at me?
no. i'm just not tired. let's go.
no!!! no!!!
he's got a gun!!
tell him i'm not here.
i did.
we're growing very concerned back here. there's no use pretending otherwise. we're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' people are beginning to ask difficult questions.
i'll make this as simple as i can, george. they disappeared.
i don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
george, listen to what you're saying. this thing's changed itself into a man. disappearing may not be that big a deal.
so far you've let it cross the heart of america. for two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security. i don't see the humor in that.
maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what i got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... i don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
is that what's affecting your performance?
i'm not being unpatriotic, and i'm doing my damndest to catch them. bell's up on 80 and i'm down here on 70 past grand junction. they're heading west. if they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. all i'm asking is that you people think about it.
you just do your job, shermin. we'll make the policy.
where did you stop last?
what the hell do you think you're doing?
where did you stop last?
stay right there...
what was your last stop?
elmo's...
where's that?
about five miles back.
where are you going?
las vegas, please. i do not speak english.
hop in.
i don't understand.
parlez vous francais?... habla ingles?... sprechen zie deutsch?
good job, neither do i. what do you do for a living?
i don't understand.
i'm a cook. do you understand 'cook?'
no.
food. eat. i prepare food. i work as a cook. that's how i make money.
i understand.
what do you do?
i make maps.
hey, that sounds interesting. you like it?
eh... yes.
make any money?
no.
you don't get rich as a cook, either, believe me. i got a girl going to college this fall. the wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for it.
do you have children?
no.
they're damned expensive and a pain in the ass sometimes, but i wouldn't trade having them for anything.
what do you think of america?
it is beautiful.
this is marc shermin. where are you, mrs. haydn?
i don't know. someplace called elmo's. look, i just wanted to tell you that i'm all right and i'm on my way home.
you've been through quite an ordeal, mrs. haydn. why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? we'll fly you home.
no. you'll want to ask a lot of questions i don't want to answer right now. i already have a ride.
is the man who kidnapped you there now?
i told you. he let me go. i'm on my way home.
get a highway patrol unit over there.
mr... i'm sorry, what was your name again?
marc shermin.
mr. shermin, i'm hanging up now. if you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. i'm in the book.
do you know what you were kidnapped by?
mrs. haydn...
he doesn't want to hurt anybody. please leave him alone.
is he on his way to lathrop wells?
you sure this is your car?
my grandmother's rich.
slow down, slow down.
geez, mrs. haydn, we just got going.
i told you i'm looking for someone.
in the cars, too?!
i don't know where he is.
this is going to be a real drag. i thought you wanted to go fast.
they after you?
what? no, of course not.
would be kinda neat if they were. i think i could outrun them. maybe get my picture in the papers.
well, here we are... you go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
thank you.
and don't be shy about your english. you speak better than a lot of people i know.  take care of yourself.
you get that, lyman?
we're ready.
i'm telling you, you're going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
if he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to vegas?
fly.
the five-fifty. we already passed it. but it'll take him way out of his way.
pull over. i've got to get back there.
why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... what did you guys do?... i won't tell anybody.
it's easier not to tell if you don't know.
wait. could i have your autograph?
sure.
i have nothing to do. i'd like to help you.
don't worry. i'll be all right.
i told you goodbye. why are you here?
the police are waiting for you up ahead. there's a roadblock. you have to go back.
this car will take me to las vegas. i cannot go back.
the police know about lathrop wells. we have to go another way. come on.
if i don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
please understand. if you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. the police know about lathrop wells. we have to go another way. i'll get you to your ship. i promise.
i will go. but not you.
you shit! i'll decide if i go or not. not you. i don't know what you do on your planet, but i didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
i don't want you to be hurt.
come on.
where are you going?
i must meet my ship.
why can't we wait here for a ride?
i feel better if i move.
we're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
asshole!!
where did you learn that?
the cook.
we're not going to get a ride tonight.
i can't stay on this planet.
no one's traveling in this weather.
you promised you would get me to my ship.
i will. i will. we still have another day.
you promised.
what do you want from me? there are no cars on this road. i didn't ask for this stupid storm.
what are you saying?
you can stop. i will go on alone.
we're too far away to walk. don't you understand?
why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
i used the last one to jump off the cliff...
let's find a place out of the rain. i'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
i can't be late. i don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. i don't know if my words went to the ship. if i'm not there, the captain will think i'm dead and go.
we'll get a ride in the morning.
you are cold.
you're damn right i am.
i do not get cold.
what?
nothing.
good morning.
horses.
you don't forget anything, do you?
no.
hello... hello. how are you this morning?
do they talk?!
no, they don't talk... we talk to them.
i understand.
oh, you're pretty...
i gave you a baby last night.
they are beautiful.
yes, they are.
you have been very good to me, jennyhaydn.  you said you wanted a baby, so i gave you one.
but...
it will be human and it will look like this.  but when it comes it will know everything i know and everything you know. that is something from my planet that i want your baby to have.
i told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
you will have this baby. if you want it. if you don't, i can stop it now.
hello george.
shermin...
what's all this for?
we have a new directive. i'm taking over.
we don't have to do it that way. we can catch him this time.
washington thinks it's too late for that.
i've never been taken off an assignment in my life. give me twenty- four hours and i'll have him for you.
you're not hearing me.
you can change a directive, george. you've done it before. listen to me. he's going somewhere in death valley. lathrop wells was never anything but a bus stop. east is the nuclear site. there are no roads in there. she was teaching him to hitchhike. i'm telling you. we block the four roads into death valley and we got him.
we'll do that. but how are we going to hold him? he can change himself into a man. he can disappear.
that's the chance we have to take.
no, we don't.
then you're going to have to do it without me.
you're a career intelligence officer, shermin. you'll be in the air with us.
you're talking about taking a life. the most unique life form on this planet. i think we're better than that.
the cowboys were right. you can make money fast gambling.
you don't make money gambling. you lose it.
do you have a good map of death valley?
we should have. let me see.
may i have twenty-five cents, please?
what for?
i want to gamble.
here are two quarters. when you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
i understand.  thank you.
this is crazy. we don't have time for this.
i know how to gamble now.
you won ten dollars. big deal. if we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
i want to get money for you and the baby.
i don't need any money for the baby. i'll be fine.
inflation, tuition, college. children are damned expensive. i know.
the cook again?
yes.
if i ever run into that guy, i'm going to kick his ass.
it'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
this is very interesting. we are born knowing our history. we have other books. but not a book like this.
any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
i understand.
it'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how america came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
many of my people will not believe those things are possible. on my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. i will be asked a lot of questions.
what will you say about us?
i will say that we can be friends.
we can.
this is yours...
if you want to keep it, you can.
i'd like to...
would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
you want the baby to laugh at me.
yes.
how long will it take you to get home?
many, many days and nights...
i'm sure we could find a country and western station.
no, thank you.
there.
