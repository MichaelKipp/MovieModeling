benny, god, take it easy...
i do not want to scare them away.
right in line with that burning tree.
i do not see anything.
it is there. the fog's thicker now, but it is there. what do you think started those fires?
benny, there is nothing there.
there is. they came out of the belly of the ship and then went to the first terrace and flew down into the houses.
flew?! oh, come on benny...
what did i tell you?
probably kids.
do not you think you should call a backup?
no, we can handle this.
mike, call for back-up.  benny, you all right?
i do not think so...
benny, this is me. I am going to take a look.
this has always been my favorite time of day.
very beautiful country up here...
any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
not on the landscape. we are trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it is hard going.
can you see under the faceplate?
no.
there is a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
wait'll you see it.
we had a flight of f16's play tag with the spaceship over michigan for an hour. then it shot straight up and disappeared.
was there visual contact?
no, sir. radar.
it could have been anything.
after i called in, i had a chance to sit down with the three locals. they swear there is another one that did not make the ship... it might be alive.
people have made mistakes in these situations before.
I have been investigating sightings for seventeen years, mr. shermin. this one's real. we have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. we have been visited. it is finally happened and the sooner washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we are going to deal with these beings, the better off we are going to be.
oh, jesus.
we better get it into the box. come on...
is it for real?
get fox.
it is real, george.
there is no mistake? you are absolutely sure?
i saw it with my own eyes. we have killed an extraterrestrial and...
is there any possibility that it is a hoax? could you be mistaken?
none. and there is another one in the area that is alive. i do not know if it is the only one. i do not know if it was left here by accident or it is part of an inva...
get the body out of there. load it on the air force chopper and get it to wright patterson. they will take it from there... we did not expect this, shermin.
neither did i.
we are going... damn!  we will tell the press that there was an accident. chemical warfare spill. that cover cannot be violated in any way. understand me, shermin?
major bell here, sir. we have to tell these people that we are friendly. that this whole thing was a mistake. is anyone trying to contact the ship?
shermin, i want you and bell to start looking for the one on the ground.
we will need a lot of help, george. you could hide an army up here.
I am going to the white house right now. I will try and get you everything you need.
wait, wait... what are my orders if we find this thing?
contain it and get back to me.
what do you mean by 'contain?'
aghh... I am supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
i would not worry about it... there might not be any little league tomorrow.
I am telling you they are probably friendly.
then why did they try and sneak in the back door? tell me that. why did not they contact us first and say...
this is crazy. what were we going to do if that had been the ship? we have two thirty calibre machine guns, three m16's and some handguns.
give it a rest, lyman.
that is because the ones that were hurt, died. they could not talk to you.
any reports about monsters, people in halloween masks, anything like that?
recognize this?
it is a copy of the plaque nasa sent into space on the pioneer probes.
houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
they must have picked it up in space.
then it is not an accident that they found us.
we do not think that is necessarily bad. at least it is a point of contact.
not necessarily bad! if they knew we were here why did not they let us know they were coming?
we will get those answers when you find the one you are looking for.
that is not going to happen, george, unless you get us the help you promised us.
we have been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it is been decided not to expand the search at this time.
do not let them do it this way, george. it is too important. we can not find this thing alone.
you have to. we are trying to contact the ship. if we do, I will let you know immediately. good luck.
please...
don't... do not do this... please...
please.
why are you doing this to me? I will give you whatever...
please...
which way do you want to go?
what?
what.
ah... no...
ah no.
steering wheel...
what.
steering wheel.

gear shift.
gear shift.
dashboard.

eh... police.

help me!!
you could have killed us both!!
he is kidnapping me!!!
jesus christ!! you crazy people...
call the police!!
hey buddy... let her go...
help me!!!
hey, she does not want to go with you. come on.
oh god, man... do not shoot me... my mistake... I am sorry...
he does not understand... just walk away...
there is nothing... no reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... seems like a totally isolated incident.
it was only an accident that we discovered them.
i know, but...
you married, major?
twenty-eight years.
to the same woman?
yes.
i tried it once... fourteen years ago... 'i was a lousy husband and a worse father. the only thing I am good at is this... at least until yesterday.
how would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
it was kind of like clicking, maybe a language was not it?
listen to this.  a woman was kidnapped in eau claire this morning. when a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
it was a man though... right?
the police think he was high on drugs...
nothing up there... the grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
it was the husband. the police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
i told you...
judy, that is stupid.
well, maybe these men will not think so. we were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. it made me so nervous i went into the kitchen for something to eat. i happened to look out the window and there was scott haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling jenny down the walk to the car.
you know that is impossible!
i know what i saw. I have seen him enough times.
scott haydn is dead. he died about three months ago. we went to the funeral.
what?
x...
george, we have just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
when can we expect containment?
well, we are in pursuit of a green mustang...
it is in a green mustang?
yes. it is kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere.
why did you let it get into a populated area?
it is taken on a disguise.
clarify that.
it is made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
the extraterrestrial now looks like this.
oh shit!!!
money.
money.
mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... jennyhaydn... money?
we are going to have to stop for gas soon.
what?
smile.
smile... good?
yes.
what?!
minneapolis.
minneapolis... minneapolis...
what are you doing?
minneapolis... good.
you are full of tricks, are not you?
no gas.
no gas.
this car runs on gas.
no gas... car dead.  we need gas. i do not want to get shot for running out of gas.
gas good?
yes. very good.
go.
it is closed... closed. we need one that is open.
closed?
you will see.
what?
not what. who. what is for things.  what? what? what? what? for people you use who. who is he?  who is she?  who are you?  who am i?
who is he? who is she? who are you? who am i?  who are you?
i am jenny haydn.
jennyhaydn.
who are you?
i am...
that is a big help. where are you from?
from?
are you from up there? space?
space?
up there... i... eh... can not explain...  but that is the only place you could be from.
gas.
closed.
no gas.
i know.
who?
my... husband.
i am husband?
no. i do not know what you are, but you are not scott.
shit.
shit?
no, no... do not say that. bad word.
shit... shit... what shit?
stop!! enough!! jesus! you are worse than a parrot!!
who?
attendant. he will give us gas. put the gun down. under the seat. under the seat...
no.
oh god! you are going to get us both killed. okay... in your pocket...
in your pocket, please...
you. mouth closed.
okay.
satisfied? now get out. out.
no.
money.
yes.
what?
candy.
what is...  ...coke?
a drink.
i...
you want to try it?
i want to try it.
this stuff could kill...  be my guest.
what is the matter?
shit!
horses.
horses.
what?
music.
you sure you want this, because... that is putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
I am afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
i do not like it, george...
dammit shermin. earlier you were asking for help. what is changed?
it is messy... the thing's got a gun... we are just asking for somebody to get killed...
we do not know what else to do. we need results.
you will get results one way or the other, that is for sure... okay.
I am going to be here if you need anything.
they are going to let some local cop blow him away.
save us all a lot of trouble.
jesus lyman, you are an ignorant fool.
bullshit!
you have no conception of this, do you?
you jerk! you look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. you know what is going to come out of this... the end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. we could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. do not you see that? are you too stupid to see that?
good... it looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so i think we should try and figure out what we are going to do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow.
did your people have any contingencies rehearsed?
that was a red light!! i told you you have to stop at a red light!!
it was yellow.
you did not even see it.
i will see it next time.
you better.
why are you going here? what is here?
my...  ...car will take me...  ...up there... home.
when do you have to be here?
i do not understand.
how will i do this one?...
sun...
yes.
sun... day. no sun... night. you understand?
yes. day... night.
how many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
three nights... two days.
that is not much time. I will just slow you down. i have to sleep. I am very tired. and i have to wash and eat. you don't...
i need you.
i will not tell anybody if that is what you are worried about. i promise. you will keep...
no.
you will keep the car. I will take a bus...  am i going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
no.
then let me go. you do not need me.
no.
i feel like I am going crazy here. you are scott. but he is dead. i do not know what is real anymore. i can not be here with you.
do you understand what I am saying to you? you can keep the car.  that should be enough for gas from here to there. please let me go.
when we get here.
gate three. it is boarding now.
thank you.
have a nice trip.
the closest i was able to get you was lathrop wells...
is that a baby?
yes.
a baby is a new person?
eh... yes...
do you have a baby?
no... the closest...
why?
I would love to have a baby. but i can't...
why?
i can't... forget the baby. okay? the closest i was able to get you was lathrop wells. you will have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
but i must go here.
i know that. but the buses do not go there.
what is hitchhike?
that is easy. I will explain that in a minute. this is your ticket. when you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. you will ride to omaha. when you get to omaha, ask the driver. 'salt lake city, please. i do not speak english.'
say it.
'salt lake city, please. i do not speak english.'
the driver will...
but i speak english.
will you please do it my way? you will get into trouble if you don't. if anybody talks to you, tell them... i do not speak english.
i do not speak english.
right. in omaha the driver will put you on the bus for salt lake city and the new driver will take...  ...this part. when you get to salt lake city, ask the driver, 'las vegas, please'...
'las vegas, please. i do not speak english.' what is hitchhike?
you want this ticket?
yes.
then do not be smart.
'lathrop wells, please. i do not speak english.'
you keep this. now this is hitch- hike...  you stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? and you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. when you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...
your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
the car will stop?
not every car, but... a car will stop... maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen...
when do i get to lathrop wells?
tomorrow morning. start hitch-hiking right away and...
do not worry. they are not going to hurt you. come on.  only show this to the driver. nobody else. and do not lose it.
can i have the gun?
no.
do not be afraid. do what i told you and you will be okay.
yes.
well... I am going to go now.
go?
yes. i have a long ride ahead of me...  goodbye.
goodbye.
jennyhaydn.
yes?
please stay.
goodbye.
what?
it is a kiss...  goodbye...
what happened?
i was afraid.
is there a reward in this?
huh?... eh... no, there is not
because I am the one who called the police, you know.
yeah, thanks. we appreciate that.
hey, it is none of my business why you are chasing a retard... you want my opinion, it is the girl. she had to hold the guy's hand all the way to the car like he was a kid.
you saw that?
hey... he did not look like no big time criminal to me.
eh... the store tells you to call when there is trouble, so they will not get sued... but that should not matter if there is a reward, right?
i would not think so.
that is what i thought. so remember it was me because sometimes rewards come late, you know.
we will.  something is wrong here. she is helping him now.
i know. she bought him a ticket for lathrop wells and put him on the bus. he did not stay on though and they drove off together.
does not make sense.
maybe he is turned her into one of them. they enter the crowd around the helicopter.
why did your ship land on this planet... on earth?
it was a mistake.
you thought we were a different planet?!
no. my ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
stars... when a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
we were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. my... eh... we kidnapped it. on it there was a map that said how to come to earth. this was very important. before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
you did? that is funny. so did we.
yes?
yes.
we told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. just to look from up there. we came and... the driver of my ship...
the captain...
the captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from earth to take home. the police came and shot at us. one of the people from my ship was killed.
oh, that is terrible. I am sorry. was he a good friend?
i do not understand 'friend.'
a friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
he was a good friend... the captain took the ship away fast and i was not in the ship.
the police should not have started shooting. but you can hardly blame them. you surprised them. they did not know you were up there. when they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
i understand.
sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
what is hell?
it is bad.
he will.
what are you doing?
are you my friend?
yes.
i am your friend.
nobody knows.
why?
i do not know.
i like this music.
I have noticed... do you understand what they are saying?
not all... but it feels like a kiss.
do you have music up there?
yes.
I would like to hear it. can you sing something?
i do not want to.
do not be afraid... I would really like to hear it.
i am not a good singer.
that was beautiful.
you liked my singing?
yes. sing some more.
what can i do for you folks?
how much are your rooms?
thirty-seven fifty for one person, forty-nine fifty for two.
you have one with two beds?
sure.
I will take that.
fill this out.  will this be cash or credit card?
credit card.
I will have to run your card off now.
we are only going to be here a few hours...
it is still the full price.
put that back.
but i have never seen this before. i am not complete.
you should not drink so much of that stuff. it is bad for you.
on the radio they say it is good.
hurry up.
the machine gave me two. should i put one back?
no. get in.
you can have one.
I am not sleepy anymore. let's drive for a little while longer.
are you angry at me?
no. I am just not tired. let's go.
no!!! no!!!
he is got a gun!!
tell him I am not here.
i did.
we are growing very concerned back here. there is no use pretending otherwise. we are rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' people are beginning to ask difficult questions.
I will make this as simple as i can, george. they disappeared.
i do not care where you are from you just can not disappear into thin air.
george, listen to what you are saying. this thing's changed itself into a man. disappearing may not be that big a deal.
so far you have let it cross the heart of america. for two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security. i do not see the humor in that.
maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what i got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... i do not feel it is as big a threat as you think it is...
is that what is affecting your performance?
I am not being unpatriotic, and I am doing my damndest to catch them. bell's up on 80 and I am down here on 70 past grand junction. they are heading west. if they are not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. all I am asking is that you people think about it.
you just do your job, shermin. we will make the policy.
where did you stop last?
what the hell do you think you are doing?
where did you stop last?
stay right there...
what was your last stop?
elmo's...
where is that?
about five miles back.
where are you going?
las vegas, please. i do not speak english.
hop in.
i do not understand.
parlez vous francais?... habla ingles?... sprechen zie deutsch?
good job, neither do i. what do you do for a living?
i do not understand.
I am a cook. do you understand 'cook?'
no.
food. eat. i prepare food. i work as a cook. that is how i make money.
i understand.
what do you do?
i make maps.
hey, that sounds interesting. you like it?
eh... yes.
make any money?
no.
you do not get rich as a cook, either, believe me. i got a girl going to college this fall. the wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for it.
do you have children?
no.
they are damned expensive and a pain in the ass sometimes, but i would not trade having them for anything.
what do you think of america?
it is beautiful.
this is marc shermin. where are you, mrs. haydn?
i do not know. someplace called elmo's. look, i just wanted to tell you that I am all right and I am on my way home.
you have been through quite an ordeal, mrs. haydn. why do not you stay where you are and let us pick you up? we will fly you home.
no. you will want to ask a lot of questions i do not want to answer right now. i already have a ride.
is the man who kidnapped you there now?
i told you. he let me go. I am on my way home.
get a highway patrol unit over there.
mr... I am sorry, what was your name again?
marc shermin.
mr. shermin, I am hanging up now. if you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I am in the book.
do you know what you were kidnapped by?
mrs. haydn...
he does not want to hurt anybody. please leave him alone.
is he on his way to lathrop wells?
you sure this is your car?
my grandmother's rich.
slow down, slow down.
geez, mrs. haydn, we just got going.
i told you I am looking for someone.
in the cars, too?!
i do not know where he is.
this is going to be a real drag. i thought you wanted to go fast.
they after you?
what? no, of course not.
would be kinda neat if they were. i think i could outrun them. maybe get my picture in the papers.
well, here we are... you go down that ramp there, you are sure to get a ride.
thank you.
and do not be shy about your english. you speak better than a lot of people i know.  take care of yourself.
you get that, lyman?
we are ready.
I am telling you, you are going to find him at the roadblock, or right after, or not at all.
if he did not want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to vegas?
fly.
the five-fifty. we already passed it. but it will take him way out of his way.
pull over. I have got to get back there.
why would not he want to go through the roadblock?... what did you guys do?... i will not tell anybody.
it is easier not to tell if you do not know.
wait. could i have your autograph?
sure.
i have nothing to do. I would like to help you.
do not worry. I will be all right.
i told you goodbye. why are you here?
the police are waiting for you up ahead. there is a roadblock. you have to go back.
this car will take me to las vegas. i cannot go back.
the police know about lathrop wells. we have to go another way. come on.
if i do not meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
please understand. if you go this way, you will never get to your ship. the police know about lathrop wells. we have to go another way. I will get you to your ship. i promise.
i will go. but not you.
you shit! I will decide if i go or not. not you. i do not know what you do on your planet, but i did not think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
i do not want you to be hurt.
come on.
where are you going?
i must meet my ship.
why can not we wait here for a ride?
i feel better if i move.
we are hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
asshole!!
where did you learn that?
the cook.
we are not going to get a ride tonight.
i can not stay on this planet.
no one's traveling in this weather.
you promised you would get me to my ship.
i will. i will. we still have another day.
you promised.
what do you want from me? there are no cars on this road. i did not ask for this stupid storm.
what are you saying?
you can stop. i will go on alone.
we are too far away to walk. do not you understand?
why do not you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
i used the last one to jump off the cliff...
let's find a place out of the rain. I am sure we will get a ride in the morning.
i can not be late. i do not know if the radio balloons work above your planet. i do not know if my words went to the ship. if I am not there, the captain will think I am dead and go.
we will get a ride in the morning.
you are cold.
you are damn right i am.
i do not get cold.
what?
nothing.
good morning.
horses.
you do not forget anything, do you?
no.
hello... hello. how are you this morning?
do they talk?!
no, they do not talk... we talk to them.
i understand.
oh, you are pretty...
i gave you a baby last night.
they are beautiful.
yes, they are.
you have been very good to me, jennyhaydn.  you said you wanted a baby, so i gave you one.
but...
it will be human and it will look like this.  but when it comes it will know everything i know and everything you know. that is something from my planet that i want your baby to have.
i told you it is impossible for me to have a baby.
you will have this baby. if you want it. if you don't, i can stop it now.
hello george.
shermin...
what is all this for?
we have a new directive. I am taking over.
we do not have to do it that way. we can catch him this time.
washington thinks it is too late for that.
I have never been taken off an assignment in my life. give me twenty- four hours and I will have him for you.
you are not hearing me.
you can change a directive, george. you have done it before. listen to me. he is going somewhere in death valley. lathrop wells was never anything but a bus stop. east is the nuclear site. there are no roads in there. she was teaching him to hitchhike. I am telling you. we block the four roads into death valley and we got him.
we will do that. but how are we going to hold him? he can change himself into a man. he can disappear.
that is the chance we have to take.
no, we don't.
then you are going to have to do it without me.
you are a career intelligence officer, shermin. you will be in the air with us.
you are talking about taking a life. the most unique life form on this planet. i think we are better than that.
the cowboys were right. you can make money fast gambling.
you do not make money gambling. you lose it.
do you have a good map of death valley?
we should have. let me see.
may i have twenty-five cents, please?
what for?
i want to gamble.
here are two quarters. when you lose these, you are not going to get anymore.
i understand.  thank you.
this is crazy. we do not have time for this.
i know how to gamble now.
you won ten dollars. big deal. if we do not get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
i want to get money for you and the baby.
i do not need any money for the baby. I will be fine.
inflation, tuition, college. children are damned expensive. i know.
the cook again?
yes.
if i ever run into that guy, I am going to kick his ass.
it will tell you pretty much everything about us...
this is very interesting. we are born knowing our history. we have other books. but not a book like this.
any words you do not know you can find in the dictionary.
i understand.
it will give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how america came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
many of my people will not believe those things are possible. on my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. i will be asked a lot of questions.
what will you say about us?
i will say that we can be friends.
we can.
this is yours...
if you want to keep it, you can.
I would like to...
would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
you want the baby to laugh at me.
yes.
how long will it take you to get home?
many, many days and nights...
I am sure we could find a country and western station.
no, thank you.
there.
where?
the yellow one.
oh, wow... I will tell you what. when the baby is born, we will go out in my back yard and wave to you.
i will wave to you.
mrs. haydn...
this is george fox...
i want to speak to marc shermin.
you can speak to me, mrs. haydn. I am in charge of this operation now.
if i do not speak to mr. shermin, I am hanging up.
okay...
hello...
i must get to my ship, mr. shermin.
we can not let you do that.
i do not want to hurt anybody. i just want to go home.
all the roads into death valley are blocked. we would like to talk to you.
if i talk to you, i will miss my ship.
hold on a minute... let's take the chance, george.
no deal.
I am afraid we can not let you go.
where do you think you are going?
thank you, jennyhaydn. you are good. i must go alone now.
i said i would get you to your ship and that is where we are going to say goodbye.
