says here that the russians exploded n a-bomb and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.
uh-huh.
how d'ya like them apples?
...ed?
huh?
russians exploded an a-bomb.
yeah.
jesus...
now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. for the kids there's the butch, or the heinie...
how ya doin', ed?
ok. take your coat, ann?
...were you in the service, ed?
no, dave, i wasn't.
...that's quite a wife you got there.
mm.
she's a rare one.
how's business, dave?
couldn't be better. these're boom times in retailing. we're opening another store, big dave's annex, there on garson. this is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. matter of fact, i'm thinking of making doris the comptroller. how're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
all right, i guess.
...fine. fine. well, you might want to drop by the annex when we open, update your suit--'course, you're in the smock all day.
...say, where do you get those things anyway?
specialty store down in sacramento.
uh-huh.
...so you tie your own flies, ed. i mean, if you're really serious. you tie your own flies, you do a--i know it's matickless, i know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, ed, you see what i'm saying?
uh-huh.
the point is there's a certain art to the process. the point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
uh-huh.
sportsmanship! that's my point. june fly, ed? mosquito? which of these? well, what fish do you seek?
yeah.
sure, go to the store. go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn fish, ed...
ok, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
we're just closing, friend.
oh, happy days! i wish i was doing well enough to turn away business! more power to ya, brother! the public be damned!
hey, what's your problem, friend? this is a business establishment with posted hours--
...you sure, eddie?
yeah, yeah--go home.
a goose, friend. i was chasing a wild goose. ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?
uh--
well, it's the wildest goose there is. risk money. very speculative. except, ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? i thought i had a prospect here. well, i make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. thank you, mother! pop goes another bubble! it's only the biggest business opportunity since henry ford and i can't seem to interest a soul!
that right.
it's called dry cleaning. you heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. it's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. and here's the capper: no shrinkage.
huh.
that's right! dry cleaning--remember the name. it's going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away. all i need is $10,000 to open my first store, then i use its cash flow to finance another, and so on-- leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain. well, me and a partner. cleanliness, friend. there's money in it. there's a future. there's room to grow... say, that's looking pretty good. let's see it with the hairpiece on...
...my first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. but maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. what if i could get the money?
honey?
mm.
...ed crane. remember? today?
sorry, friend, i, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
i'm, uh, i'm--the barber.
jesus! the barber! i'll be a sonofagun. why didn't you say so? 'course--the barber.
...i didn't recognize you without the smock. did i--damn--did i leave something at the shop?
no. i might be interested in that, uh, business proposition--
you got the dough?!
i can get it, yeah.
come in, come in, siddown over there. coffee?
no. i--tell me--
sure.
what's involved, aside from putting up the money? what're you looking for the partner to do?
do? hell, nothing. well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but i'm looking for a silent partner. i've done the research, i've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. i'm just looking for venture capital, friend. disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--i want the dough; i don't take attendance.
and how do we share--
fifty-fifty, straight down the line. you and me. finance and expertise. so--you've got the dough then, do ya?
i'll have it in a week.
well, i'll be damned. the barber! and i thought this trip was a bust. well...
...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. here's to ya, uh...
ed.
...was that a pass?
maybe.
you're out of line, mister.
no problem!
way out of line.
right! strictly business.
yeah.
frank.
huh?
this hair.
yeah.
...you ever wonder about it?
whuddya mean?
i don't know... how it keeps on coming. it just keeps growing.
yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
no, i mean it's growing, it's part of us. and we cut it off. and throw it away.
come on, eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
...i'm gonna take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
what the--
i'm gonna mingle it with common house dirt.
what the hell are you talking about?
where you going?
me? us! the party at nirdlinger's--i told you last week, for the christmas push.
yeah, right.
come on, get ready. it's important.
nah, go ahead. i'm not big on parties.
oh, don't be a grump.
...huh?
haven't i seen you up in ladies' wear?
i don't work here. my wife does.
uh-huh. some beat, huh?
yeah.
check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
uh-huh.
...ed, i...
what is it, dave?
uh-huh.
hell, i, i'm not proud of it. but, uh, that's not the worst of it. i got a note. a blackmail note. you know, come across or everybody knows.
uh-huh.
well, you know what that would do to me.
i guess it would be pretty awkward.
awkward?! ann'd throw me out on my keister! hell, it's her family's store--*her* store. i serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, ed.
uh-huh.
i only work here! and the lady's husband would know... oh, jesus.
how much to they want, dave?
$10,000! i don't know what to do, ed. i don't know what i *can* do. even though i know who the sonofabitch is.
...you know... who *who* is?
the sonofabitch. the blackmailer. it's, uh, it's no one you know. it's a businessman from sacramento. a goddamn pansy, ed. he tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; i heard him out and then told him to go to hell. and the very next day, the very next day, ed, i get blackmailed for the same amount.
would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
well, i guess he don't care that it's obvious.
mm. how, uh... how did he know that--
he's staying at the hotel i've gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. must've seen us.
...oh, jesus.
...why don't you just pay him, dave?
that's my capitalization on the annex! *my* operation, ed! christ almighty. that's what i was just talking to doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from ann.
mm.
embezzling, ed. from my own goddamn wife!
...did you make that up?
oh, no. that was written by mr ludwig van beethoven.
that was quite something.
he wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
that was something. i'm ed crane.
i know who you are, mr crane.
...i'm rachel abundas. everyone calls me birdy.
sorry, i just didn't remember.
...you don't like the music out there?
it's ok, i guess. no, i don't really. i'm not big on music, ordinarily.
...what a knucklehead.
who?
dave.
how's that?
ahh...
...money problems. he's thinking about canceling the annex.
so?
*that means i don't run nirdlinger's!*
mm.
...you bring a check?
cash.
cash?!
...usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. but cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
sure.
i got the paperwork here. partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, i supply professional services, you supply the capital. i'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
yeah.
pretty straightforward, but i don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
it's ok.
yeah, screw 'em, huh? pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it, what's the point?
...just a second here, i'll give you a receipt on the, uh... whoa, nellie... oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, i, uh, i think i'm gonna call the place tolliver's, after me, you know, i didn't think you were much interested in, uh--
that'll be fine.
yeah, good. lemme just, uh...
...yeah, that's it. as per our discussion.
uh-huh.
well, there it is. writ large in legal escriture, next step is--
look, uh... creighton...
...you're not gonna screw me on this?
*screw* you--jesus! take it to a lawyer! no, i insist! this is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! i must say, i've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and i've never--
all right.
and i've never been asked--look, you want the dough back? you know who i am! you--
ok.
...what's so damn strange about that?
i didn't say a word.
'gratulations, gina. it's so goddamn wonderful.
congratulations, gina.
life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
honey...
it's just a goddamn bowl of cherries, i'm sure.
please, ed.
but it's...
please, ed.
your place?
i'm at nirdlinger's. let yourself in.
ok.
...dave?
come on in.
...it ruined me. this money. no annex. i'm all shot to hell.
so you paid the guy?
...what kind of man *are* you?
...huh?
what kind of man *are* you?
big dave--
i'd understand if you'd walked in here. socked me in the nose. whatever. i deserved it.
i, uh...
i'm not proud of what i did. but *you*.
...how you today, ed?
ok.
you don't got a headache?
...nah.
damn, i got a headache to beat the band.
...we goin'?
huh? no.
...look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched.
they sent us to tell ya.
huh?
they sent us to tell ya. we pulled the detail.
my *wife*?
yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
homicide.
well, embezzlement. and homicide. a guy named david brewster. he's, uh... he's the decedent.
i don't understand.
he's the dead guy.
...yeah, it's a tough break.
visiting ends at five. too late today. you can see her tomorrow.
sorry, pal. they sent us to tell ya.
'lo, ed.
hello, walter.
thanks. thanks for seeing me, at home.
oh, hell. drink?
no thanks.
sure you don't need one?
i'm fine.
ok. boy. jesus!
yeah. what do i, uh...
well, of course, i, uh, it's out of my league, criminal stuff. i do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... i'd be absolutely worthless, something like this. absolutely worthless.
'scuse me, just finished dinner. um. frankly, doris'd be better off with the county defender.
he a good man?
bert's ok, sure, he's a good man. i won't kid you though, ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... and i hear they're bringing a prosecutor up from sacramento. capital offense. taking it seriously... hmm...
so--
taking it seriously.
so, who should i--
hello, rachel.
i'm so sorry... i was sorry to hear.
yeah. thanks.
coffee, ed?
i'm fine. thanks.
no thanks, honey.
...so, uh, who should i--
well, there's lloyd garroway in san francisco. probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about lloyd garroway. conservative. jury might like that. might like that here.
...probity.
uh-huh. is he the best then, for, uh...
well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you freddy riedenschneider. out of sacramento. 'course, i don't know how you're fixed for money.
uh-huh. he's the, uh...
yeah, the best.
honey.
how are you?
i don't know what's going on. i--
what happened to you?
...i don't know what happened to big dave. i know some of it. irregularities in my books, they said. can i explain it.
you don't have to--
i helped him cook the books, ed. i did do that.
you don't have to tell them anything. we're getting you a lawyer.
i know all about that. but i don't know how much to tell them.
don't tell 'em anything. we're getting you freddy riedenschneider.
should i... should i tell you why?
you don't have to tell me anything.
...my books used to be perfect. anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
honey...
i knew we'd pay for it.
this is what family is for, ed! this is when ya come together!
yeah.
close ranks! goddamnit! those sons of bitches!
frank, uh, you know i'll try to contribute, but, uh--freddy riedenschneider--
i don't care what it costs! this is when ya come together!
that's very generous.
the hell with it, eddie!
they're just people like you and me, ed. remember that.
uh-huh.
just people. they gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. this is why the big lobby, ed. but they put their pants on one leg at a time. just like you and me.
uh-huh.
they too use the toilet, ed. in spite of appearances. and their money will be secured by the barbershop. a rock. a *rock*, the barbershop. i mean, how long has *this* place been here?
yes, sir.
could you come with me please?
sure. can ed come too?
mr...?
crane. ed crane.
you also have an interest in the securing property?
he's a barber.
ah.
second chair.
not an owner.
no, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
ah-hah. it would be best if he waited here.
...you're ed crane?
yeah--
barber, right? i'm freddy riedenschneider. hungry? they tell me the chow's ok here. i made some inquiries.
no thanks, i--
look, i don't wanna waste your time so i'll eat while we talk. ya mind? *you* don't mind. so while i'm in town i'll be staying at the hotel metropole, the turandot suite. yeah, it's goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's ok though, i poked around. i'm having 'em hold it for me on account of i'll be back and forth. in addition to my retainer, you're paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. we'll talk about appeals if, as and when. for right now, has she confessed?
no. of course not. she didn't do it.
good! that helps. not that she didn't do it, that she didn't confess. of course, there's ways to deal with a confession, but that's good!--one less thing to think about. now. interview. i'm seeing her tomorrow. you should be there. three o'clock. one more thing: you keep your mouth shut. i get the lay of the land, i tell *you* what to say. no talking out of school. what's out of school? everything's out of school. i do the talking; you keep your trap shut. i'm an attorney, you're a barber; you don't know anything. understood?
...ok.
good! any questions give me a ring-- turandot suite; if i'm out leave a message. you sure you don't want anything? no?
hello, ed.
ann. will you come in?
...i'm so sorry about your loss.
yes. thank you.
of course, you know, doris had nothing to do with it. nothing at all.
oh, i know. don't worry, ed. i came to tell you...
yes, ann?
and you should tell doris...
yes?
we went camping last summer. in eugene, oregon. *outside* of eugene, ed.
...yes?
at night, there were lights--we both saw them. we never told anyone, outside of our official report.
ann--
a spacecraft. i saw the creatures. they led big dave onto the craft. he never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. of course he told *me*. no one else.
ann--
the government knows. i cannot repeat it to you. but this thing goes deep, ed. this was not your wife. i goes deep, and involves the government. there is a great deal of fear. you know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. they try to limit it, and--
ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
sometimes knowledge is a curse, ed. after this happened, things changed. big dave... he never touched me again.
i knew about it. big dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
terrific. your husband backs you up. that's terrific.
...you've gotta give me something to work with. freddy riedenschneider is good, but he's not a magician. he can't just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. look. look at what the other side is gonna run at us. they got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's motive. they got a murder scene *you* had access to. that's opportunity. they got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--
it was big dave's.
--don't interrupt me--that's means. they got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
*i* was with her.
ok, we forget the blackmail. *you* killed him. how come?
he and doris... were having an affair.
ok, how did you know?
i... just knew. a husband knows.
will anyone else say they knew?
i don't know. i don't think so.
how did you get into the store?
i took doris's keys.
will anyone say they saw you there? on your way there? in there? on your was back?
...i don't think so.
will anyone corroborate and goddamn part of your story at all?
...i don't get it.
look, chum, this is a guy, from what i understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? island hopping, practically liberated the pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of jap guts between his teeth.
yeah.
and now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in san diego. you asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: mr hale-fellow-well-met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. they called, they demanded money...
...did big dave mention that it was something about his war service? i don't know, i wasn't there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; i'm not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. fat-assed sonofabitch!
so... who... who actually--
who? *who?!* i don't know who! but the point is that if mr prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he's spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might *know* who! but we can't *know* what really happened! because of fritz, or werner, or whatever the hell his name is! and because me prosecutor is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it's easier to victimize your wife! because it's easier *not* to look! because the more you look, the less you know! but the beauty of it is, we don't *gotta* know! we just gotta show that, goddamnit, *they* don't know. reasonable doubt. science. the atom. *you* explain it to me. go ahead. try.
he was deaf when he wrote this.
who?
beethoven. he created it, and yet he never actually heard it. i suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow.
hi, mr crane.
hello, birdy. i thought that was very good.
oh, in there? i messed up a little bit in the scherzo. i guess, if nobody noticed, it's ok. mr crane, this is tony, a friend of mine. tony, mr crane.
hello, tony.
...i'm crane.
my name is diedrickson. county medical examiner.
yeah?
rye.
just coffee.
you sure you don't want something stiffer?
...doesn't become a matter of public record unless there's foul play. however. i don't believe i'm *prohibited* from telling you this. i guess i'm not obliged to tell you, either. i don't exactly know.  but if *i* were the man, i'd want to be told.
told what?
i, uh... thanks.
...hell, i hope i've done the right thing.
my wife and i had not... performed the sex act in many years.
ed, how're you holding up?
i'm ok, walter, thanks.
i'm so damn sorry about your loss. terrible thing. just damn terrible.
yeah.
birdy's in the parlor--i'm on long distance here.
sure, walter. thanks.
hello, mr crane.
hello, birdy.
we haven't seen you since... i'm terribly sorry.
yeah.
we've certainly missed you.
birdy, i've been doing a lot of thinking. there are a lot of things that haven't worked out for me. life has dealt me some bum cards...
...or maybe i just haven't played 'em right, i don't know. but you're--
pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
sure... sure, it's his house.
that's what he keeps telling me.
anyway, uh... my point is you're young. a kid really, your whole life ahead of you. but it's not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. before it all washes away.
well, sure, i guess. pop says so too. i work pretty hard at school.
that's swell. however, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from mrs swan, they'll only take you so far. there's this guy in san francisco, i've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. his name is jacques carcanogues. i'm not sure i'm pronouncing it right. anyway, he's a frenchman.
boy.
you've got talent, anyone could see that. and he's the best. if he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. you're a cinch to be accepted, i could cover the cost of the lessons, like i said, it's pretty modest--
oh, mr crane--
i have to do it. i can't stand by and watch more things go down the drain. you're young, you don't understand.
geez, mr crane, i don't know. i hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
i know you haven't. look, just go meet him as a favor to me. i talked to this guy. hope i pronounced his name right. he sounded very busy, but he's not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when i told him how talented you are. he agreed to see you this saturday. he said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. his words.
geez, mr crane.
just see him, as a favor to me.
...you are ze fahzer?
no. uh... family friend.
i speak to you on ze phone, non? you have a special interest in music?
uh-huh.
ah yes, a music lover.
well, i don't pretend to be an expert.
ah.
...mm.
well? how'd she do?
ze girl?... she seems like a very nice girl. she *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. ztinks. very nice girl. however, ztinks.
i don't understand.
is not so hard to understand. her playing, very polite.
did she make mistakes?
mistake, no, it says e-flat, she plays e-flat. ping-ping. hit the right note, always. very proper.
i don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--i thought you taught the, uh, the--
ah, but that is just what i cannot teach. i cannot teach her to have a soul. look, monsieur, play the piano, is not about the fingers. *done* with the fingers, yes. but the music, she is inside. inside, monsieur...
...she can go up there.
well, look, i don't claim to be an expert--
then you listen to me, for i am expert. that girl, she give me a headache. she cannot play. nice girl. very clever hands. nice girl. someday, i think, maybe, she make a very good typist.
...i stank, didn't i?
he didn't say that.
but more or less.
look, i'm no expert, but--
it doesn't matter, mr crane.
i'm sure there's a dozen teachers better than this clown. more qualified. goddamn phony.
but it doesn't matter. really, i'm not interested in playing music professionally.
...i'm not certain i'll have a career at all, and if i do, i'll probably be a veterinarian.
...uh-huh.
i do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
ah... it's nothing.
i'm only sorry that i didn't play better for you. i know it would've made you happy. you know what you are?
huh.
you're an enthusiast.
huh. yeah. maybe...
...i guess i've been all wet.
but i do appreciate it, mr crane...
...i wanted to make you happy.
birdy--
it's ok...
...no, please.
please, mr crane, it's ok, please--
hello!
hello.
doesn't bother me.
well, have you ever considered tar macadam? people think it's just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...
...doris--
nah, don't say anything. i'm alright.
are you awake?... is he awake?
crane? we have to tell you, as soon as you're conscious--is he conscious?
his eyes are open.
uh... you're under arrest.
as soon as the doctor lets us, we gotta move you. does he understand that? we're supposed to tell him. are you conscious?
you'll go to the prison hospital.
under arrest for murder.
birdy... i didn't mean to--
what'd he say?
birdy...
what'd he say? does he understand?
he said ok. is that what he said?
not guilty, your honor...
i tried to tell him the whole story, but riedenschneider stopped me. he said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of big dave...
...i gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. he talked about how i'd lost my place in the universe...
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
...how i was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the d.a. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for doris...
...who among us is in a position to say...
...he told them to look at me--look at me close. that the closer they looked the less sense it would all make, that i wasn't the kind of guy to kill a guy, that i was the barber, for christ's sake...
...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
...well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. there was nothing left to mortgage; riedenschneider went home and the court appointed lloyd garroway...
