says here that the russians exploded n a-bomb and there is not a damn thing we can do about it.
uh-huh.
how d'ya like them apples?
...ed?
huh?
russians exploded an a-bomb.
yeah.
jesus...
now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda-jerk; there is not much to it once you have learned the basic moves. for the kids there is the butch, or the heinie...
how ya doin', ed?
ok. take your coat, ann?
...were you in the service, ed?
no, dave, i wasn't.
...that's quite a wife you got there.
mm.
she is a rare one.
how is business, dave?
could not be better. these are boom times in retailing. we are opening another store, big dave's annex, there on garson. this is strictly haberdashery--casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. matter of fact, I am thinking of making doris the comptroller. how're things at the, uh, the barbershop?
all right, i guess.
...fine. fine. well, you might want to drop by the annex when we open, update your suit--'course, you are in the smock all day.
...say, where do you get those things anyway?
specialty store down in sacramento.
uh-huh.
...so you tie your own flies, ed. i mean, if you are really serious. you tie your own flies, you do a--i know it is matickless, i know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, ed, you see what I am saying?
uh-huh.
the point is there is a certain art to the process. the point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.
uh-huh.
sportsmanship! that is my point. june fly, ed? mosquito? which of these? well, what fish do you seek?
yeah.
sure, go to the store. go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn fish, ed...
ok, boys, which of you gets the privilege?
we are just closing, friend.
oh, happy days! i wish i was doing well enough to turn away business! more power to ya, brother! the public be damned!
hey, what is your problem, friend? this is a business establishment with posted hours--
...you sure, eddie?
yeah, yeah--go home.
a goose, friend. i was chasing a wild goose. ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?
uh--
well, it is the wildest goose there is. risk money. very speculative. except, ed, in certain situations, it is not, see? i thought i had a prospect here. well, i make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's going to be tied up in expansion plans of his own. thank you, mother! pop goes another bubble! it is only the biggest business opportunity since henry ford and i can not seem to interest a soul!
that right.
it is called dry cleaning. you heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning'-- wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. it is all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. and here's the capper: no shrinkage.
huh.
that is right! dry cleaning--remember the name. it is going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are going to bear the fruit away. all i need is $10,000 to open my first store, then i use its cash flow to finance another, and so on-- leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain. well, me and a partner. cleanliness, friend. there is money in it. there is a future. there is room to grow... say, that is looking pretty good. let's see it with the hairpiece on...
...my first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. but maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. what if i could get the money?
honey?
mm.
...ed crane. remember? today?
sorry, friend, i, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.
i'm, uh, i'm--the barber.
jesus! the barber! I will be a sonofagun. why did not you say so? 'course--the barber.
...i did not recognize you without the smock. did i--damn--did i leave something at the shop?
no. i might be interested in that, uh, business proposition--
you got the dough?!
i can get it, yeah.
come in, come in, siddown over there. coffee?
no. i--tell me--
sure.
what is involved, aside from putting up the money? what are you looking for the partner to do?
do? hell, nothing. well, you will want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but I am looking for a silent partner. I have done the research, I have contacted the vendors, the deal is set. I am just looking for venture capital, friend. disappear if you want, check in whenever you like--i want the dough; i do not take attendance.
and how do we share--
fifty-fifty, straight down the line. you and me. finance and expertise. so--you've got the dough then, do ya?
I will have it in a week.
well, I will be damned. the barber! and i thought this trip was a bust. well...
...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. here's to ya, uh...
ed.
...was that a pass?
maybe.
you are out of line, mister.
no problem!
way out of line.
right! strictly business.
yeah.
frank.
huh?
this hair.
yeah.
...you ever wonder about it?
whuddya mean?
i do not know... how it keeps on coming. it just keeps growing.
yeah--lucky for us, huh, pal?
no, i mean it is growing, it is part of us. and we cut it off. and throw it away.
come on, eddie, you are going to scare the kid.
...i'm going to take his hair and throw it out in the dirt.
what the--
I am going to mingle it with common house dirt.
what the hell are you talking about?
where you going?
me? us! the party at nirdlinger's--i told you last week, for the christmas push.
yeah, right.
come on, get ready. it is important.
nah, go ahead. I am not big on parties.
oh, do not be a grump.
...huh?
have not i seen you up in ladies' wear?
i do not work here. my wife does.
uh-huh. some beat, huh?
yeah.
check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
uh-huh.
...ed, i...
what is it, dave?
uh-huh.
hell, i, I am not proud of it. but, uh, that is not the worst of it. i got a note. a blackmail note. you know, come across or everybody knows.
uh-huh.
well, you know what that would do to me.
i guess it would be pretty awkward.
awkward?! ann'd throw me out on my keister! hell, it is her family's store--*her* store. i serve at the indulgence of the goddamn ownership, ed.
uh-huh.
i only work here! and the lady's husband would know... oh, jesus.
how much to they want, dave?
$10,000! i do not know what to do, ed. i do not know what i *can* do. even though i know who the sonofabitch is.
...you know... who *who* is?
the sonofabitch. the blackmailer. it's, uh, it is no one you know. it is a businessman from sacramento. a goddamn pansy, ed. he tried to rope me into some crackpot scheme; i heard him out and then told him to go to hell. and the very next day, the very next day, ed, i get blackmailed for the same amount.
would he... it sounds pretty obvious.
well, i guess he do not care that it is obvious.
mm. how, uh... how did he know that--
he is staying at the hotel I have gone to with, uh, with the lady in question. must have seen us.
...oh, jesus.
...why do not you just pay him, dave?
that is my capitalization on the annex! *my* operation, ed! christ almighty. that is what i was just talking to doris about, a way of getting the money from the store that we could hide from ann.
mm.
embezzling, ed. from my own goddamn wife!
...did you make that up?
oh, no. that was written by mr ludwig van beethoven.
that was quite something.
he wrote some beautiful piano sonatas.
that was something. I am ed crane.
i know who you are, mr crane.
...i'm rachel abundas. everyone calls me birdy.
sorry, i just did not remember.
...you do not like the music out there?
it is ok, i guess. no, i do not really. I am not big on music, ordinarily.
...what a knucklehead.
who?
dave.
how is that?
ahh...
...money problems. he is thinking about canceling the annex.
so?
*that means i do not run nirdlinger's!*
mm.
...you bring a check?
cash.
cash?!
...usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. but cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
sure.
i got the paperwork here. partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, i supply professional services, you supply the capital. I will give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
yeah.
pretty straightforward, but i do not know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
it is ok.
yeah, screw 'em, huh? pay 'em to tangle it up and then you pay 'em to untangle it, what is the point?
...just a second here, I will give you a receipt on the, uh... whoa, nellie... oh, by the way, we did not talk about this, i, uh, i think I am going to call the place tolliver's, after me, you know, i did not think you were much interested in, uh--
that will be fine.
yeah, good. lemme just, uh...
...yeah, that is it. as per our discussion.
uh-huh.
well, there it is. writ large in legal escriture, next step is--
look, uh... creighton...
...you're not going to screw me on this?
*screw* you--jesus! take it to a lawyer! no, i insist! this is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! i must say, I have been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I have never--
all right.
and I have never been asked--look, you want the dough back? you know who i am! you--
ok.
...what's so damn strange about that?
i did not say a word.
'gratulations, gina. it is so goddamn wonderful.
congratulations, gina.
life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost will not believe it.
honey...
it is just a goddamn bowl of cherries, I am sure.
please, ed.
but it's...
please, ed.
your place?
I am at nirdlinger's. let yourself in.
ok.
...dave?
come on in.
...it ruined me. this money. no annex. I am all shot to hell.
so you paid the guy?
...what kind of man *are* you?
...huh?
what kind of man *are* you?
big dave--
I would understand if you would walked in here. socked me in the nose. whatever. i deserved it.
i, uh...
I am not proud of what i did. but *you*.
...how you today, ed?
ok.
you do not got a headache?
...nah.
damn, i got a headache to beat the band.
...we goin'?
huh? no.
...look, pal, it is a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched.
they sent us to tell ya.
huh?
they sent us to tell ya. we pulled the detail.
my *wife*?
yeah, uh, they brung her to the county jail, uh...
homicide.
well, embezzlement. and homicide. a guy named david brewster. he's, uh... he is the decedent.
i do not understand.
he is the dead guy.
...yeah, it is a tough break.
visiting ends at five. too late today. you can see her tomorrow.
sorry, pal. they sent us to tell ya.
'lo, ed.
hello, walter.
thanks. thanks for seeing me, at home.
oh, hell. drink?
no thanks.
sure you do not need one?
I am fine.
ok. boy. jesus!
yeah. what do i, uh...
well, of course, i, uh, it is out of my league, criminal stuff. i do, uh, probate, real estate, title search, uh... I would be absolutely worthless, something like this. absolutely worthless.
'scuse me, just finished dinner. um. frankly, doris'd be better off with the county defender.
he a good man?
bert's ok, sure, he is a good man. i will not kid you though, ed, nobody around here has any experience with this kind of, er... and i hear they are bringing a prosecutor up from sacramento. capital offense. taking it seriously... hmm...
so--
taking it seriously.
so, who should i--
hello, rachel.
I am so sorry... i was sorry to hear.
yeah. thanks.
coffee, ed?
I am fine. thanks.
no thanks, honey.
...so, uh, who should i--
well, there is lloyd garroway in san francisco. probity--you know, no one ever said anything iffy about lloyd garroway. conservative. jury might like that. might like that here.
...probity.
uh-huh. is he the best then, for, uh...
well, the best, the money-is-no-object best, for a criminal case, any lawyer would tell you freddy riedenschneider. out of sacramento. 'course, i do not know how you are fixed for money.
uh-huh. he is the, uh...
yeah, the best.
honey.
how are you?
i do not know what is going on. i--
what happened to you?
...i do not know what happened to big dave. i know some of it. irregularities in my books, they said. can i explain it.
you do not have to--
i helped him cook the books, ed. i did do that.
you do not have to tell them anything. we are getting you a lawyer.
i know all about that. but i do not know how much to tell them.
do not tell 'em anything. we are getting you freddy riedenschneider.
should i... should i tell you why?
you do not have to tell me anything.
...my books used to be perfect. anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
honey...
i knew we would pay for it.
this is what family is for, ed! this is when ya come together!
yeah.
close ranks! goddamnit! those sons of bitches!
frank, uh, you know I will try to contribute, but, uh--freddy riedenschneider--
i do not care what it costs! this is when ya come together!
that is very generous.
the hell with it, eddie!
they are just people like you and me, ed. remember that.
uh-huh.
just people. they gotta put up the big front so that people will trust them with their money. this is why the big lobby, ed. but they put their pants on one leg at a time. just like you and me.
uh-huh.
they too use the toilet, ed. in spite of appearances. and their money will be secured by the barbershop. a rock. a *rock*, the barbershop. i mean, how long has *this* place been here?
yes, sir.
could you come with me please?
sure. can ed come too?
mr...?
crane. ed crane.
you also have an interest in the securing property?
he is a barber.
ah.
second chair.
not an owner.
no, he is family, he is my brother-in- law.
ah-hah. it would be best if he waited here.
...you're ed crane?
yeah--
barber, right? I am freddy riedenschneider. hungry? they tell me the chow's ok here. i made some inquiries.
no thanks, i--
look, i do not wanna waste your time so I will eat while we talk. ya mind? *you* do not mind. so while I am in town I will be staying at the hotel metropole, the turandot suite. yeah, it is goofy, the suites're named after operas; room's ok though, i poked around. I am having 'em hold it for me on account of I will be back and forth. in addition to my retainer, you are paying hotel, living expenses, secretarial, private eye if we need to make inquiries, headshrinker should we go that way. we will talk about appeals if, as and when. for right now, has she confessed?
no. of course not. she did not do it.
good! that helps. not that she did not do it, that she did not confess. of course, there is ways to deal with a confession, but that is good!--one less thing to think about. now. interview. I am seeing her tomorrow. you should be there. three o'clock. one more thing: you keep your mouth shut. i get the lay of the land, i tell *you* what to say. no talking out of school. what is out of school? everything's out of school. i do the talking; you keep your trap shut. I am an attorney, you are a barber; you do not know anything. understood?
...ok.
good! any questions give me a ring-- turandot suite; if I am out leave a message. you sure you do not want anything? no?
hello, ed.
ann. will you come in?
...i'm so sorry about your loss.
yes. thank you.
of course, you know, doris had nothing to do with it. nothing at all.
oh, i know. do not worry, ed. i came to tell you...
yes, ann?
and you should tell doris...
yes?
we went camping last summer. in eugene, oregon. *outside* of eugene, ed.
...yes?
at night, there were lights--we both saw them. we never told anyone, outside of our official report.
ann--
a spacecraft. i saw the creatures. they led big dave onto the craft. he never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. of course he told *me*. no one else.
ann--
the government knows. i cannot repeat it to you. but this thing goes deep, ed. this was not your wife. i goes deep, and involves the government. there is a great deal of fear. you know how certain circles would find it--the knowledge--a threat. they try to limit it, and--
ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
sometimes knowledge is a curse, ed. after this happened, things changed. big dave... he never touched me again.
i knew about it. big dave told me about it, and the spot he was putting himself in by getting the money.
terrific. your husband backs you up. that is terrific.
...you've got to give me something to work with. freddy riedenschneider is good, but he is not a magician. he can not just wave his little wand in the air and make a plausible defense materialize. look. look at what the other side is going to run at us. they got the company books, prepared by you--*cooked* by you--that's motive. they got a murder scene *you* had access to. that is opportunity. they got that little trimmer thing he was stabbed in the throat with--a *dame's* weapon--
it was big dave's.
--don't interrupt me--that's means. they got a fine upstanding pillar of the business community as a victim, and then they got *you*, a disgruntled number-juggling underling who on the day in question was drunk as a skunk and whose alibi for the time in question is being passed out at home, alone.
*i* was with her.
ok, we forget the blackmail. *you* killed him. how come?
he and doris... were having an affair.
ok, how did you know?
i... just knew. a husband knows.
will anyone else say they knew?
i do not know. i do not think so.
how did you get into the store?
i took doris's keys.
will anyone say they saw you there? on your way there? in there? on your was back?
...i do not think so.
will anyone corroborate and goddamn part of your story at all?
...i do not get it.
look, chum, this is a guy, from what i understand, told everybody he was a war hero, right? island hopping, practically liberated the pacific all by himself with a knife in one hand and a gun in the other and twenty yards of jap guts between his teeth.
yeah.
and now it turns out this dope spent the war sitting on his ass in some boatyard in san diego. you asked for blackmail, let me give you blackmail: mr hale-fellow-well-met, about to open his own business here, has been lying to everybody in this town for the last four years, probably including half the people sitting on that jury. well, it finally caught up with him--these dopes, it always does; someone threatened to spill it. somebody knew his dirty little secret, just like your wife says. they called, they demanded money...
...did big dave mention that it was something about his war service? i do not know, i was not there, *you'll* have to tell *us*. maybe he specified, maybe he didn't; I am not putting words in your mouth; the point is that this liar, this cynical manipulator, this man who through his lies sneered and belittled the sacrifice and heroism of all our boys who *did* serve and bleed and puke and die on foreign shores, and who made a fool out of this entire town, turns to *you* to help him out of his jam. fat-assed sonofabitch!
so... who... who actually--
who? *who?!* i do not know who! but the point is that if mr prosecutor over there had devoted half the time he is spent persecuting *this* woman to even the most cursory investigation of this schmoe's past, then we might *know* who! but we can not *know* what really happened! because of fritz, or werner, or whatever the hell his name is! and because me prosecutor is *also* a lazy fat-assed sonofabitch who decided it is easier to victimize your wife! because it is easier *not* to look! because the more you look, the less you know! but the beauty of it is, we do not *gotta* know! we just got to show that, goddamnit, *they* do not know. reasonable doubt. science. the atom. *you* explain it to me. go ahead. try.
he was deaf when he wrote this.
who?
beethoven. he created it, and yet he never actually heard it. i suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow.
hi, mr crane.
hello, birdy. i thought that was very good.
oh, in there? i messed up a little bit in the scherzo. i guess, if nobody noticed, it is ok. mr crane, this is tony, a friend of mine. tony, mr crane.
hello, tony.
...i'm crane.
my name is diedrickson. county medical examiner.
yeah?
rye.
just coffee.
you sure you do not want something stiffer?
...doesn't become a matter of public record unless there is foul play. however. i do not believe I am *prohibited* from telling you this. i guess I am not obliged to tell you, either. i do not exactly know.  but if *i* were the man, I would want to be told.
told what?
i, uh... thanks.
...hell, i hope I have done the right thing.
my wife and i had not... performed the sex act in many years.
ed, how're you holding up?
I am ok, walter, thanks.
I am so damn sorry about your loss. terrible thing. just damn terrible.
yeah.
birdy's in the parlor--i'm on long distance here.
sure, walter. thanks.
hello, mr crane.
hello, birdy.
we have not seen you since... I am terribly sorry.
yeah.
we have certainly missed you.
birdy, I have been doing a lot of thinking. there are a lot of things that have not worked out for me. life has dealt me some bum cards...
...or maybe i just have not played 'em right, i do not know. but you're--
pop does not like people smoking in here.
sure... sure, it is his house.
that is what he keeps telling me.
anyway, uh... my point is you are young. a kid really, your whole life ahead of you. but it is not too soon to start thinking... to start making opportunities for yourself. before it all washes away.
well, sure, i guess. pop says so too. i work pretty hard at school.
that is swell. however, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from mrs swan, they will only take you so far. there is this guy in san francisco, I have made inquiries, everybody says he is the best. trained lots of people who have gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. his name is jacques carcanogues. I am not sure I am pronouncing it right. anyway, he is a frenchman.
boy.
you have got talent, anyone could see that. and he is the best. if he thinks a student has talent, he will take 'em on for next to nothing. you are a cinch to be accepted, i could cover the cost of the lessons, like i said, it is pretty modest--
oh, mr crane--
i have to do it. i can not stand by and watch more things go down the drain. you are young, you do not understand.
geez, mr crane, i do not know. i had not really thought about a career or stuff.
i know you haven't. look, just go meet him as a favor to me. i talked to this guy. hope i pronounced his name right. he sounded very busy, but he is not a bad egg; he loosened up a little when i told him how talented you are. he agreed to see you this saturday. he said maybe you were a diamond in the rough. his words.
geez, mr crane.
just see him, as a favor to me.
...you are ze fahzer?
no. uh... family friend.
i speak to you on ze phone, non? you have a special interest in music?
uh-huh.
ah yes, a music lover.
well, i do not pretend to be an expert.
ah.
...mm.
well? how did she do?
ze girl?... she seems like a very nice girl. she *plays*, monsieur, like a very nice girl. ztinks. very nice girl. however, ztinks.
i do not understand.
is not so hard to understand. her playing, very polite.
did she make mistakes?
mistake, no, it says e-flat, she plays e-flat. ping-ping. hit the right note, always. very proper.
i do not understand, no mistakes, she is just a kid--i thought you taught the, uh, the--
ah, but that is just what i cannot teach. i cannot teach her to have a soul. look, monsieur, play the piano, is not about the fingers. *done* with the fingers, yes. but the music, she is inside. inside, monsieur...
...she can go up there.
well, look, i do not claim to be an expert--
then you listen to me, for i am expert. that girl, she give me a headache. she cannot play. nice girl. very clever hands. nice girl. someday, i think, maybe, she make a very good typist.
...i stank, did not i?
he did not say that.
but more or less.
look, I am no expert, but--
it does not matter, mr crane.
I am sure there is a dozen teachers better than this clown. more qualified. goddamn phony.
but it does not matter. really, I am not interested in playing music professionally.
...i'm not certain I will have a career at all, and if i do, I will probably be a veterinarian.
...uh-huh.
i do appreciate the interest you have taken, though.
ah... it is nothing.
I am only sorry that i did not play better for you. i know it would have made you happy. you know what you are?
huh.
you are an enthusiast.
huh. yeah. maybe...
...i guess I have been all wet.
but i do appreciate it, mr crane...
...i wanted to make you happy.
birdy--
it is ok...
...no, please.
please, mr crane, it is ok, please--
hello!
hello.
does not bother me.
well, have you ever considered tar macadam? people think it is just for public works and commercial purposes, roads, parking lots, so forth...
...doris--
nah, do not say anything. I am alright.
are you awake?... is he awake?
crane? we have to tell you, as soon as you are conscious--is he conscious?
his eyes are open.
uh... you are under arrest.
as soon as the doctor lets us, we got to move you. does he understand that? we are supposed to tell him. are you conscious?
you will go to the prison hospital.
under arrest for murder.
birdy... i did not mean to--
what did he say?
birdy...
what did he say? does he understand?
he said ok. is that what he said?
not guilty, your honor...
i tried to tell him the whole story, but riedenschneider stopped me. he said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he did not see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of big dave...
...i got to hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. he talked about how I would lost my place in the universe...
...a puny player on the great world's stage...
...how i was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the d.a. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he had not had a chance to trot out for doris...
...who among us is in a position to say...
...he told them to look at me--look at me close. that the closer they looked the less sense it would all make, that i was not the kind of guy to kill a guy, that i was the barber, for christ's sake...
...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...
...well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. there was nothing left to mortgage; riedenschneider went home and the court appointed lloyd garroway...
