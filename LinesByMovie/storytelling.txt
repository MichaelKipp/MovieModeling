hey, you want to hear my short story now?
huh?
i can read it to you.
you mean, again?
well, i changed the ending a little.
oh. what happens now?
well, actually, it's the same, but longer. i think it's better. more...raw.
well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
but it won't make any sense if you hear it out of context.
i think you should leave it the way it was. it was good.
so you don't want to hear my new ending?
you'll read it in class tomorrow. surprise me.  anyway, i have to go. i promised melinda i'd help her with her oral.
you're tired of me. i can tell.
marcus, i'm tired. that's all.
you've lost interest...you hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.
i was never much of a sweater. you know that.
look, vi, i don't blame you. you feel you feel pity now. the pleasure isn't there any more. the kinkiness has gone...you've become kind.
what do you want?
don't be so upset. it's ok...
what the fuck are you talking about? what's ok?
you know he hated my story also.
your story was terrible!
marcus...you'll write something better next time!
patronizing fuck! if you had just been honest with me in the first place i wouldn't have read it. i knew it was shit. but - idiot! - i believed you!
that's not fair! i was honest! just because i wasn't sucking up like 	that bitch catherine.
well, i sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.
i admit it - i was scared! i was shocked, in fact , by what he said. and he's so...convincing. i'm sorry if i let you down, but really, i still say he's just one opinion. i don't even like his books that much. they're all so aggressively confrontational. i don't care if he's won the pulitzer prize.
hello, vi.
what are you doing here?
what are you doing here?
i'm sorry. i didn't mean, i just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
well, now you have.
yeah, um, then...are you alone?
uh huh.
can i join you?
you're not.
good.  'cause i...um...i really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
that's good.
and i also agreed with what you said today about marcus's story. it is a piece of shit.
you have beautiful skin.
thank you.  so catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
maybe. she's ok.
aren't you going out with catherine?  i'm sorry. it's none of my business. i didn't mean...
i'm not 'going out' with catherine.
oh.  do you think i have a potential as a writer?
no.
thank you for being honest.
it's over there.
thanks.
it's a really nice place you have. is the rent high?
take off your top.
oh, bu...uh...i can't say that.
say, ni...
ni...
...gger.
...gger.
say, 'nigger.'
nigger.
'fuck me hard!'
fuck me hard!
say, 'nigger, fuck me hard!'
nigger, fuck me hard!
again!
nigger, fuck me hard!!...
again!!
nigger, fuck me hard!!!...
hello?
hello, is this pam?
who is this?
toby oxman.
toby -? oh, hi! how are you?
oh, fine. how are you?
great!
great!
so what's going on?
that's what i was gonna ask you.
but...you called.
oh, yeah, well...um...i was just calling because, well, i was wondering if you still remembered me, which i guess you do...
yeah.
so. look at where we are: the year 2000! can you believe it? i mean, did you ever think we would actually make it?
um, well, yeah.  so are you still acting?
oh, no, not any more. no, um, i kind of came to terms with myself, i realized i had done what i had to do. and it was time to move on.
oh. so what did you do after you gave up on acting?
well, i went to law school, if you can believe that.
i believe it.
yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke - and a rip-off, so, uh...so i dropped out.
oh, that's too bad.
yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.
anything i might know about?
well, um, i kind of let things go on this novel i'd been really into - i mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. i mean, really, it's finished.
that's too bad.
i worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, i mean, that was like - i mean, i have some dignity.
that's good. so then what do you do now?
i'm a documentary filmmaker.
oh? anything i might have seen?
n-not yet. i'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. geez, remember when we were teenagers?
yeah. you didn't wanna take me to the prom.
oh, i don't remember that...
i do.
well, but it was so long ago. we were so different back then...
uh, well, anyway, so i'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. i wrote to derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. but everything's still kind of in development at this point.
hunh.
that's good.
yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. what about you? i'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.
yeah. but not any more.
oh. tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
yeah...so you're um...you're married?
yeah.
huh. kids?
yeah.
how many?
three.
great. how old are they?
eight, six, and four.
wow, that really is great. in a few years, who knows, maybe they'll want to be in my documentary!
listen, toby, i can't really talk right now. do you mind if i call you back?
yeah, sure.
ok. bye.
maybe she has caller id.
no, not really.
any books you like to read for fun?
no.
none at all? how about those 'underground' comics?
i hate reading.
all right, scooby, let's not beat around the bush. with your attitude, you're not going to get in anywhere.
ok.
'ok.' so you just don't care.  let me ask you, not as your guidance counselor, but...as a friend: what do you want to do with your life? i mean, what kind of long-term goals can you possibly have?
i dunno...
c'mon. talk to me. tell me what you're thinking.
well, i mean...i wanna be on tv. maybe have a talk show or something. like conan. or early letterman.
ah-hah. and how is it you hope to achieve this goal?
i dunno. see if i have any connections.
i don't know what's wrong with that kid.
maybe he's gay.
don't ever say that.
what if he is?
he isn't.
marty, ignore him.
he's vegetarian, doesn't do sports...
i just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
don't even joke about that!
i'm serious! what happens if he blows up the school?
fuck!
i'm going in there.
was anyone in my room today?
is everything ok?
my cd case like totally collapsed. i'm gonna have to recatalogue all weekend.  hey. can you pass the salad over.
steak's really good tonight. scooby  good.
got a lot of homework?
i dunno.
whaddya mean you don't know? you either got a lot or you don't. what's not to know?
marty...
you started filling out your college applications yet?
what are you going to do?
i dunno.
what do you know?
dad, i'm trying to figure things out right now, ok? it's like, really hard, and i'm just listening to some old elton john and...
out! leave the table!
what?
you heard me: leave the table!
man, i am out of here! this family is so fucked!
mom, it's not fair if brady can say the f-word and i can't.
yeah, well, mikey, listen up. cause here's a lesson: life's not fair.
consuelo?
yes, mikey?
do you have any brothers or sisters?
yes.
really? how many?
four brothers and five sisters.
wow.  why did your parents have so many children? i mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
it was god's will.
but do you really believe in god? and heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
no.
so? how was school today?
the same.
the same. same as what?
just the same.
we're studying the holocaust in social studies.
oh, yeah?
we did the same thing last year also.
how was the class?
well, i'm supposed to watch schindler's list for homework. the movie's like almost four hours. and then i'm supposed to write a report on survivors.  you know any survivors, dad?
hmmm...do i know any...personally...?
well, technically your zeda is a survivor.
he was in a concentration camp?
well, no. but he had to escape the nazis.
but i thought he came over to america before the war.
well, he did. with his family. but his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. and if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. so in my book he's a survivor.
even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
but that could've happened to him. or to me, if i'd been alive. or you.
well...yes. if it hadn't been for hitler, he wouldn't have had to leave europe. we would have been...european.
but then, in a sense, since you would never have met dad if your family had stayed in europe...if it weren't for hitler, none of us would have been born.
get the hell outta here!
man, it's just, like, conversation.
you a pervert?
no...actually, i'm a documentary filmmaker?
oh. you mean, like, blair witch project?
well, no. i'm doing one on high school students, in fact.
what for?
well...it's kind of a sociological study in the aftermath of columbine.
is this to like get into sundance?
yeah, well, it's possible they would be interested in it.
doubt it.
actually, there is some interest from the sundance channel.
whoopee.
hbo and mtv have also shown some interest.
which is it? you gotta keep your focus straight.
you're absolutely right. the focus is on the college admissions process today.
and you want scooby to be the focus of all this?
scooby and a few other students of different socioeconomic backgrounds.
oh, well, i don't have them yet, but
reconceive.
'cause scooby does have a quality that i've been looking for, a quality that is emblematic of american today. it's part disillusionment, part hope...
twinkeys!
boys, take napkins...napkins...
not to be crass, but what do we get out of this?
don't worry, he doesn't mean money.
oh, i know, i know that. well, sharing your story, your ups and downs, and so forth, can i hope, be an illuminating experience.
yeah...how do we know we won't be exploited?
so whaddya think?
well, i'm not really sure what you're trying to say. it's funny, i suppose. but it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
i'm not making fun. i'm showing it as it really is.
you're showing how superior you are to your subject. toby no, but i like my subject. i like these people.
no, you don't.
yes, i do. i love them!
the camerawork's nice.
thanks. i'll tell mike.  well, it's still just a beginning. i know i can...dig deeper.
hi, scooby! how was school today?
fine.
ready for tomorrow?
what's tomorrow?
the sats, knucklehead. scooby i'm not taking them.
mom?
yes, mikey?
i was looking through scooby's sats practice books this afternoon and i took one of the practice tests. guess what score i got?
what?
550 verbal, 520 math. and i'm only in fifth grade!
scooby?
yeah?
we have to talk.
whaddya wanna talk about?
don't screw around with me. you know what i'm talking about.  you're taking those sats. you're taking those sats or your cd collection is history. you're taking those sats and you're going to college. you're taking those sats if i have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.
ok.
tired of this shit...
pretty cool, stanley.
thanks.
how'd you get it?
it's my dad's he hides it under some old tv guides in his closet.
gee, your dad's smart.
i know.
is it loaded?
no, i don't think so...
scooby, don't! be careful!
i'm not an idiot, man. i watch tv.
i know. i'm sorry. i'm just...a little nervous, i don't know why.
you should be.
scooby?
yeah?
you know...i like you.
yeah. i know.
i mean...
you want some?
no, thanks.
hey, scooby! how's it going?
conan o'brien? whoa! what are you doing here?
i'm looking for a last-minute guest for my show. any suggestions?
i'll be your guest!
really? well, all right! let's take a look at the television and see how we look.
welcome to the show, scooby.
thank you.
nice to have you here.
great to be here.
and thank you for dressing up for us. this is very classy. tell us. what kind of professional plans do you have? what's in your future?
well, i was thinking...i might work for you.
ahh...tell me. what do you want to do for me? what's your idea?
be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a tv talk- show host.
tv talk-show host, ok. you were at sidekick eight seconds ago, then tv talk-show host. you'll be a latin dictator in a bout a minute.
hey.
hey. what's up?
there's something i need to talk about with you.
what?
there are some rumors...
like what?
you know...stanley...
oh.
and like, don't take this the wrong way...i mean, i'm cool...but...you know...i've got a good reputation at school and, well...i really don't want it ruined.
no prob. i'm cool.
thanks, scoob.
when i'm in high school i'm not going to play any football. i'm just going to concentrate on class rank.  what did you do in high school?
i did not go to high school.
weren't there high schools in el salvador?
we had to work. my family was poor.
must've been hard being poor.
i'm still poor.
hmmm.  but, consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
no, mikey.
but like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
i'm always working.
but when you're not. like now. what do you like to do?
this is work.
but it's not like real work. this is just babysitting.
this is definitely better.
you think so? you don't think that this might not be a little dry?
this is entertainment you're making, toby. this story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
yes, i knowbut still, it should be somewhat entertaining.
i mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
no, no, no. no exploitation. this is seriousbut don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?
you've got a family tragedy on your hands. will you tell me what's funny about that? about a kid in a coma?
nothing, i guess
i mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
ok, you're right, you're right  you know, we need to screen what we've gotinvite some regular people, just some random off-the- street typesand see what real people think of this.
i dunno, toby. we really have a long way to go. you still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening
ok, then we can invite serious intellectual types.
we're not ready.
hip alternative types who will understand the process better
we're not ready!
well, i need to see this with an audience!
what's an audience going to tell you?
i don't know. maybe they'll like it.
consuelo. are you crying?
no.
yes, you are. i can tell. what's the matter?
mi jesusmi jesus
speak english.
mi jesus esta muerto!
consuelo, i'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak english i can't understand you.
my jesus
who is jesus?
my baby.
you have a bay?
my grandchild-baby.
gee, i didn't even know you had any children. but why are you so upset about jesus?
he's dead.
oh. how did it happen?
he was executed. he was on death row and then he was executed.
how did they execute him?
poison gas.
maybe it's for the besti mean, if he was guilty of doing  something wrongpeople who are bad should be killed. don't you think so?
jesus was not bad.
maybe he was and you just didn't know it.
he wasn't.
but still, you can't be sure.
i am sure.
but really, you never know.
i know!
why was he on death row?
for rape and murder.
consuelo, what is rape exactly?
it is when you love someone, and they don't love you. and then you do something about it.
sometimes i feel like my parents don't love me.
well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
dad?do you think that brady will ever get better?
one in a million recover.
maybe he's that one in a million!
mikey, there's optimism, and then there's stupidity. it's a very fine line.
i don't think there's any hope, either. i was just trying to make you feel better.
thanks.
you're welcome.  dad?would you let me try hypnotizing you now?
yeah. sure go ahead. hypnotize me.
ok. stay there. i'll be right back.
hey, mikey. you wanna get some ice cream?
ok!
so like, yeahi caved in. i mean, i had to. my parents, they're like still really depressed about brady. so i wrote the bullshit essay. filled out the applications, did the interviewsy'know, i figure i can always drop out.
so where'd you get in?
prnceton.
but what did you get on your sats?
200 verbal/710 math. kinda weird, i know. but i think they thought it was, like, good-weird.
we used pull.
you know, you have to. sometimes you just have to, toby.
but what kind of pull did you have?
i have a cousin. very big giver to the alumni fund.
it's all about who you know.
look, we're not suckers. everyone else is out there doing the same thing.
he's right.
hey, um, toby? i was wonderingis the documentary almost finished?
uh, yeah, we're getting there.
can i see what you have so far?
sureumyeah, as soon as i have a screening i'll let you know.
thanks man.
hey, mikey!
hi, dad!
come here, give me a hug!
gee, you're home early!
yeah, uh, listen. why don't you go upstairs and keep your mom and brady company for a bit? i need to speak alone with consuelo for a moment.
sure, dad.
i think scooby's like a lot of kids. he just hit aa speed bump. now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and i think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. and everybody else is gonna be happy.
...but mr livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
what is most important to you?
i dunno. i'd like to be good at something. it doesn't have to be tv. i mean, it could be movies...anything. i'd be willing to direct.
uh, scooby, now i understand how you want to be a tv talk-show host and all, like conan o'brien, but did you know even he went to college?
he did?
yeah. he went to harward.
oh.
sure!...
of course, honey. come in bed with us. come on.
oh, my god, scooby! i'm so sorry...i'm so, so sorry...
don't be. your movie's a hit.
