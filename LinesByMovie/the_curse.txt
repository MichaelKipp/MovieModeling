i have cramps. i can not believe i let you talk me into this.
come on, we have been double dating since the fourth grade.
yeah even then look what happened: michael mortenson kissed you and billy sullivan threw a worm at me.
well that is not going to happen tonight. george said carlton's a nice guy.
translation: a total geek.
anything's better than mark.
my shrink says he is not so bad.
your shrink always gives you bad advice. he only hears what you choose to tell him. mark's an asshole, he cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he is never had a regular job.
he is a very talented musician.
every woman at some point has to date a musician. i wish you would get rid of mark for good. every time you break up you see him more than when you were going out.
i guess i have a weakness for him. it is those big brown bambi eyes.
so do not look in his eyes.
i wonder what it is like being you. being noticed all the time.
people notice you frida.
so i asked the bartender what "coyote ugly" meant. it is like the "bagger" system. you know, a two- bagger -- someone so ugly that you need two bags -- one bag to put on their head and another one in case it blows off. or a three-bagger...
two bags for them, and one bag for your head in case her two fall off.
he has not said one word to me.
maybe he is just shy.
my date always pays more attention to you than to me.
frida, i do not mean this as a criticism, but you might not want to talk about pms around men.
sorry. it is just so bad lately. you are so lucky you never get pms.
i get a little bloated sometimes.
I would kill for just a little bloated.
it all starts with them going to the bathroom together.
that many women in one place -- nothing good can come from that.
sorry about frida. she is been friends with jen forever.
what is with her? if they are not bleeding they are pmsing. if they are not pmsing, they are warning you about the impending doom. if you are lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. then you got to date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
I am lucky jen's not like that.
i do not believe in pms. women made it up just so they can be bitchy.
my brother has an answer to pms. a-s-s: abundant sperm syndrome. a man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman is not givin' it to 'em, he is got to get it elsewhere.
yeah and when your woman says you are an ass, say yes, i have abundant sperm syndrome.
how about i give you a make-over? you will feel better about yourself. you are actually pretty, you are just not bringing it out.
you are just saying that.
do you really need these?
only to see.
can not you get contacts?
no, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
try to get through dinner without them. you have beautiful eyes.
he was saying that when women are close friends they get their periods at the same time.
yeah and when we are mad at each other we are out of sync. it only works if you are on good terms.
or if there is a full moon.
or if your boyfriend's an asshole.
the nielson's?
on your desk.
script coverage?
on your desk.
coffee and...
your desk.
that I am a doormat of course. the shrink makes more notes.
oh, i see... interesting theory.
okay, just one more stop and you will be all set. victoria's secret.
what do i need overpriced fancy underwear for? should not a guy have already decided that he likes me before he sees me in lingerie?
it is not about him seeing you in it. it is how you feel. you will feel sexy in lingerie and it will show. it is an inner thing.
i do not know.
there is a sale. it is such a nice place -- classical music, relaxing atmosphere. you deserve to pamper yourself. come on, it can not hurt.
where are all the mediums?
frida, grab that red one.
can you believe she fuckin' bit me?
and she got the medium.
even on sale that stuff's a fortune. i worked all week to pay for a bra.
i think she broke the skin.
what a bitch. you should see a doctor. that can be dangerous. george bit me once and i had to go to the emergency room.
george bit you?
i kind of asked him to. we were, you know... he got a little carried away...
a bite... where did you get bitten?
at victoria's secret.
there was a sale.
i mean where on your body?
oh, on my wrist.
a dog at victoria's secret?
no, it was another woman.
how is the rest of your health?
good. except for pms.
pms. what symptoms are you experiencing?
it is hard to describe. i get really bloated and irritable and emotional and depressed and...
that is just part of being a woman. diet and exercise should help. avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine, alcohol...
what else is there?
and keep a journal of your symptoms to make sure it is related to your period and not just in your head.
it is not just in my head.
i know.
so you are grant's secretary?
i do development for tv movies.
oh, a d-girl. you know... i have a really great idea for a screenplay.
you are kidding, really?
no, I am serious. how about we have dinner and i tell you about it?
nah, i do not wanna break up with wanda, i just wanna see carmen too.
man, you are livin' dangerously. let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they will sleep with you?
you kiddin'? they try to get me drunk.
you are some catch lloyd.
hey, you hear about the chick that came in today? said some chick bit her at victoria's secret. bitches are outta control these days.
what, you got a date or somethin'?
since when do you care?
you look different. i mean you look good.
you never say that.
you do though. you look really... is that a wonderbra?
no.
look what you did!
oh my god, I am sorry!
shit. and you are eating my burger? you do not eat meat.
i can not help it, it smells so good.
ouch that stings! damn, what am i going to do with my back like this?
worried about what all your girlfriends might think?
frida, you know you are it for me.
yeah right... you better go.
hey wait, i paid three bucks for that burger. you owe me...
you have not even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
I am working on it...
why did gregory ask me out? i mean he is cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
maybe he likes you, ever think of that? it is good for you to go out -- get your mind off mark.
you are so lucky you have george and do not need to go on dates anymore.
what i really hated about dating was the lines guys used to get into my apartment. "can i use your phone?" "how about a nightcap?" "i want to meet your cat." and my all-time favorite, the old standby, "i have to use your bathroom."
maybe they have to pee.
are you kidding? he might as well say, "can i date rape you?"
i never thought of it like that. i never know what to do on dates. do guys still pay?
they better. of course, trouble is, you never know what they will expect for it. you got to know what to order, and what you are willing to do. like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he is going to feel like you owe him something.
where?
where? where do you think a mustache would be. look!
i do not see anything. maybe just a little.
holy shit, I am a freak.
you are not frida, we all have a little hair there. i did not even notice till you showed me. we can bleach that, it is no big deal.
hey, did you get contacts?
oh, my glasses! maybe my eyes got stronger from not wearing them.
you hungry?
starving.
man I am starving too, i think I will go for the surf and turf.
I am not really hungry after all.
you said you are starving. come on, i can not stand a woman who will not eat.
so there i was, hanging from the edge of a bridge, when my mom said, "son, you got into harvard!" it took three of them to pull me back! frida keeps eating.
well, whattdaya think?
that is great. highly original.
I would really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
hey, how about a little nightcap?
I am really tired.
come on, did not all that steak make you thirsty?
no. really, i'm... i do not feel well. I have got terrible pms.
they say sex is great for cramps.
well i have it worse than cramps. goodnight gregory.
what?
i really gotta pee.
you should have gone at the restaurant.
i did not have to pee then.
my apartment's just such a mess.
that is okay. i just have to use the bathroom and then I will leave.
oh come on. knock it off.
knock what off?
you do not have to pee.
yes i do have to pee!
you are just saying that to get into my apartment and then you are hoping that will turn into something else.
i would not mind doin' something else, but i do really have to pee.
uh huh. so pee.
so pee? here?
yeah. whip it out. you want me to see it -- that is what this is all about, right?
it is about gregory jameson. he is dead.
oh my god, what happened?
he was found a few blocks away.
torn apart. limb from limb. a bloody gruesome mess.
jesus christ she got her period. relax guys. it happens.
yeah, sorry. uh... gregory's roommate told us you were out with him last night.
yes... i... we had dinner.
did he come home with you? did you go to his apartment?
no, it was our first date.
looks like it was your only date. unless you go to his funeral.
when is the last time you saw him?
we... he walked me home and... we said goodnight. um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.
a kiss? did you have sex with him?
no, i said it was our first date.
how the hell is that your business?
we are just trying to figure out what happened.
i wish i could help but last i saw gregory was outside my front door.
okay, if you think of anything else, please give us a call.
you want her sheets?
we can just take this pillowcase.
we can get a warrant if you like.
no, take it.
he is dead? am i bad luck or what?
there you go, blaming yourself for everything again.
and he was ripped limb from limb?
I am sure they were exaggerating.
why would they exaggerate?
to sound like big macho cops. he was probably just found with a knife in his back.
so did you do it?
did i kill him? of course not!
no, did you fuck him?
no. i do not think so.
you do not think so? you either did or your didn't.
i do not remember. we kissed at my door and next thing i knew i woke up with my period. alone.
did you get smashed or what? you have to eat if you are drinking. and not just those little salads.
i ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak and a half with gregory.
i guess you are off that vegetarian kick you have been on for ten years.
i could not stop eating steak. i felt out of control -- like i was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. i could not get enough. and then gregory walked me home... and he peed in front of me.
what? why the hell did he do that?
he was trying to get into my apartment and... i know this sounds gross but i was so turned on. i grabbed him and kissed him!
and then?
i think i went in and fell asleep. i guess gregory walked home and got killed! i blacked out.
at least your pms is over.
and my bra finally fits again.
i thought you were going to stop wearing your glasses.
my vision got worse again.
are those mark's?
no, mark wears boxers. they must have been in the dryer already.
uh huh... good thing those cops did not see that.
he was cute, huh? of course whenever i meet a guy, I am wearing no make-up.
rule one: always wear make-up.
i wonder if he is married.
he was not wearing a ring. but you do not want to date a cop frida. they are so blue collar.
i did not trust her. all that blood on the sheets. she may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep's clothing. something is weird.
that dude was torn limb from limb. no way a woman like that could have done it. you never seen blood on a chick's sheets from her period?
hell no, I am not into that shit. the sight of blood makes me sick.
oh, so you decide to be a cop? seriously? you do not have sex with a woman cause she is on the rag?
no man. blood is not a turn on. you sure let that frida off the hook. you were not even going to take the sheets. if i did not know better, I would think you liked her.
i can tell she is not a killer. you just do not like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.
nah, man, I am just saying, you should never date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive.
gross, so this is mark's flesh? when did you see him?
um, he stopped by yesterday before you came over.
why did not you tell me? you said you had not seen him for a month.
I am sorry. i did not want you to think i was still a doormat.
frida, I am your friend. I am not judging you... you did not sleep with the creep did you?
how about a "man in jeopardy" story?
did you change your hair?
a little.
frida's sheets checked out fine. it was just her own blood. from her... you know.
i told you she was innocent.
hey, there was a lot of blood.
she was never a suspect lloyd. some animal must have done this.
i checked all the zoos. no missing animals. you think a pitbull?
maybe. what about all those hairs they found on his body?
waiting for dna tests. he was hairier than madonna in penthouse.
madonna's in penthouse?
back in the '80's. you did not see the pictures? they were from before she got famous. she was hairy as hell. her pits, her bush.
hairy women are kind of sexy. women in their natural state.
what?
and you think I am sick?
i can not read any more crap. these women are all victims.
yes, that is what we are looking for.
i think we should do something with strong female characters...
I will make a note of that. put the coverage on my desk.
that bite healed up quickly. it is been about three weeks?
nearly four.
how have you been feeling?
okay, but I am worried about the next pms bout. it is gotten worse. I am not myself during it. i get bloated, irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get sharper and i have more facial and body hair.
sounds all stress related. your teeth may feel sharper if you are grinding them at night. you do not seem hairy to me. is that all?
i get crazy dreams and i black out.
diet and exercise, that is all there is. I am not a big proponent of the pms craze, but there is a book my wife mentioned called "the pms diet," which may be helpful.
does she have pms?
now it is menopause. she is always hot. i got to wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. it is always something.
you busted me.
are you following me?
no... no... this is embarrassing. i was returning your pillowcase... and i saw you cross the street... and i sort of started following you. i just find you really intriguing. i do not know why.
intriguing?
i gotta get going. peter gets the pillowcase out of his bag.
at least let me give you this back. i washed it.
where did you get the bike?
I am kinda borrowing it. who is this, mr. date-guy?
being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
that is my ex. he is an asshole. in case you could not tell. i think he is been following me.
there is a lot of that going around.
you wanna get some coffee?
I am trying to stay away from caffeine.
some decaf then? that was stupid. obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
no. really. i do not drink coffee anymore. i used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
okay well. maybe some other time. they continue walking together.
so what book did you buy?
oh, it is nothing.
no really, i love knowing what people read.
it is stupid.
i can forgive you a bestseller.
my mom used to get pms too.
used to? did it stop finally?
no, she died when i was twelve.
I am sorry.
I have had time to get over it. she was killed by wolves they think.
oh my god, by wolves?
we lived in northern minnesota. she went for a walk one night and they never found her body -- just her torn apart clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. then the town rounded up bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.
I am so sorry peter. gee, that sure puts my problems in perspective.
the weird thing is I have had an odd, morbid fascination with wolves ever since.
I have read scripts about detectives, but never met one. must be wild.
sometimes it is frustrating. like this gregory jameson case. we do not even know what killed him. I am putting together little details to see if we are missing something.
like what?
you know how moms always tell you to wear clean underwear in case you are in an accident? well this guy was not wearing any underwear.
a lot of people do not wear underwear.
yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need briefs to keep things in line.
how about you? briefs or boxers?
briefs.
cool. i do not get guys who wear boxers. my ex wore boxers. i never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
me neither. that is why i wear briefs... so why did you and... mark break up?
he is bad news. he cheated on me, he insults me. now suddenly he gets jealous if i have a date.
i really gotta get going.
thanks for the walk. maybe we could... get a bite sometime?
yeah. maybe.
goodnight.
goodnight.
i do not think I have ever actually liked anyone I have dated before. peter even likes me without makeup.
hmmm. sounds suspicious.
i do not know much about him. how do you know if a guy is decent?
give him the tampon test.
what the hell is the tampon test?
you are at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "i'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" if he says no, he is too embarrassed, then you know he is a wus. if he says he is got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. but if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he is a decent guy. then, while he is out...
what are those?
silver bullets. a collectors item. these are very valuable. they were melted down from a crucifix.
what are they for?
oh just my wolf paraphernalia. some people collect beanie babies... i collect silver bullets.
I am a cop -- i notice everything. that drawer's ajar, that picture's been moved about an inch, the closet was not closed when i left...
okay, you busted me.
what is wrong?
oh, nothing's wrong. just... well do not you have your period?
my period? no.
i mean we can still... whatever... maybe i should get a towel?
no. no, I am fine. maybe i should go. i mean... i do not want our first time to be like this.
frida, wait. do not go. we can just sleep. i just want to wake up with you.
I am freaking out. I am like an animal and totally out of control. my arms keep getting really hairy.
you have to stop being so self- critical frida.
i looked like an italian man!
how did it go with the cop?
we almost slept together... and... then the hair started and i booked.
frida, this hair thing is all in your head. you are using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.
it is just as well. I am afraid of getting hurt again. mark seemed great at first too. i do not want to get too attached to peter and then find out he is a creep.
hey, carlton's in town -- come out with the three of us.
no he didn't. come on, i do not want to be alone with those two. all they talk about is basketball and it bores the hell out of me.
okay. i guess so.
great. george is meeting carlton first for drinks. we can meet and go together. it will be a blast.
come on, I have been working with frida. carlton will not even recognize her now. she is really coming out of her shell.
she is just so... pathetic.
she is just insecure. once you get to know her she is fabulous.
she will talk about pms and stare at her salad.
i started out on that eye-of-newt diet the doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.
well whatever it was, seems to have worked cause you look great.
you are just saying that.
what did he say?
i think he called you beautiful.
oh my god. I have never had that before. I have had guys say they want me to suck their dicks and gross stuff but no one's ever said "hey there beautiful."
guess you like those coyote ugly steaks now, huh?
sorry, do not mean to be wolfing down. I am just starving.
do not apologize. it is great to see a woman really enjoying her food. i hate it when i buy a woman dinner and she will not even touch it.
no one I have run into knows what "coyote ugly" means.
maybe that bartender made it up. i mean i think coyotes are rather beautiful. maybe "coyote ugly" is really a compliment. like someone who is conventionally "ugly" but is really beautiful.
yeah that is like a three bagger. today a bag is also a condom, so now a three bagger can be a chick that is really hot. so hot you got to put several condoms on to dull the senses.
charming carlton.
it is so hot in here.
bag means condom now? i can not keep up with the word "bag." it used to be "no, that is not my bag" -- meaning not my thing. but now "my bag" means "my fault."
i still thought it was a purse.
waiter! she needs more water.
can we get some service here?
you might want to tape your nipples down next time. it is really distracting.
i can not help it. my bra would not even fit. I have been going to victoria's secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I am busting out. it is this pms.
geez, i wish I would get it like that.
no you don't, believe me.
oh my god, look. my arms are so hairy!
no they are not.
yes they are! look how much more hair i have than you!
it is just cause mine is finer. a little bleach'll fix that.
i look like fuckin' chewbacca.
no way is that the same chick. the other one was a dog.
jennifer gave her a make-over.
looks like a helluva lot more than a make-over. was there surgery involved?
sorry i did not recognize you earlier. you look so different.
I have changed a lot lately.
you should not smoke. it will kill you.
yeah yeah i know. smoking kills. I will quit someday. does not it seem like all the cool people smoke?
no.
james dean, humphrey bogart...
yul brynner. they are all dead.
yeah but they looked cool...
what?
your lips look delicious.
wow your body's really hot.
I have been working out.
i mean body temperature. do you have a fever?
never felt better.
i wonder how frida and carlton are getting along?
carlton insisted on leaving with her. maybe he got lucky.
so now being with frida is lucky? i thought you said she was a flake.
it is for you. frida.
tell her I am eating.
frida, this is a bad time. we are having sex and george actually answered the phone.
there is a man's arm in my bed.
jennifer. a severed arm. it is bloody and... I am not sure but it may be carlton's.
you fucked carlton? see i told you he liked you.
no! not fucked him, i think i killed him.
please come over. I am begging you. what should i do with the arm? should i call the cops or... peter?
frida, you are not making sense. i can not come over right now.
jennifer?
no it is mom.
mom!
we are worried about you. "60 minutes" was on same-sex couples.
what does that have to do with me?
you have not mentioned dating anyone since mark and, well you are not a lesbian are you?
no, I am not a lesbian. geez mom.
it is okay if you are, we just want to know. i do not want to be expecting grandchildren if...
oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. you following me again?
no. i was doing my laundry.
I am sorry -- I am on edge today.
was there anything in that washer?
no. nope, nothing in it.
you sure? it is my favorite shirt, mind if i check?
no! i... i checked when i put my stuff in. i always look through the washer first.
everything okay?
a man killed in central park.
so where is this infamous arm now?
i put it down the garbage disposal.
and what makes you think you killed a man?
because of pms, i get hairy, my nails turn into claws, i eat raw meat, i roam the city hunting for flesh. I have become a werewolf!
you are a pms werewolf. of course. frida, are you on drugs?
no, last night i think i chased carlton around as a wolf and killed him. i woke up with a taste of blood in my mouth and a severed arm in my bed. and my throat hurts.
you are delusional. maybe you had a bad dream and bit your lip -- so you tasted blood. and the severed arm... well i do not see it and... maybe this is all in your head.
it took me an hour to clean it up. that was not in my head!
maybe the blood was from your period like before.
i have not gotten it yet.
frida, listen to yourself. if i said i was a werewolf, would you believe me?
i do not know. you have to take sammy. he is afraid of me.
i think I am a werewolf.
let's explore this. what makes you feel you are a werewolf?
i ate a guy last night.
and how did you feel when you ate this guy?
i do not know. i do not remember doing it.
dreams about killing usually signify feelings of guilt. you had sex last night and you feel guilty.
we did not have sex.
you say you killed a man and do not remember it. could not you have had sex and not remember it? it is sexual. why did you choose "eating him" as the method of killing?
cause I am a fucking werewolf!!
you use the word "fucking." you are sexualizing things. stop berating yourself. it is okay to have sex.
I am supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I am allergic to cause your friend's got pms?
it is so bad she becomes a werewolf.
you have some weird friends. what does her thinking she is a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?
do not be stupid george. obviously if she is a werewolf, she can not be around a cat. she might eat it and besides, cats are afraid of wolves.
oh great. what the fuck am i supposed to do?
take some allergy medicine.
you can not believe this bullshit.
she is my best friend. i got to be there for her -- no matter how crazy it sounds. I have been in some bad relationships and she is been there for me. she is lonely. if pretending she is a werewolf helps, then more power to her.
he was found nearly ripped to shreds in central park.
and he was missing an arm.
i still do not get when you gave her back the pillowcase.
we only live a few blocks apart.
this is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
okay lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
she is got a hidden pitbull. maybe she hired someone to kill them.
she is not a suspect. what is her motive? there is nothing, nothing connecting her to either crime except that she dated both guys.
sounds like you got a conflict of interest.
you take the cake lloyd. come on, she is not here. let's check out her psycho ex.
hello?
frida? i was worried to death about you. I have called you for two days. where have you been?
I have been here. what day is it?
tuesday. are you okay?
shit, i guess i missed work.
frida, carlton's dead.
oh no.
and he was missing an arm.
oh my god jennifer. i should go to confession.
relax. carlton was torn apart. no way could you have done that. maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it out... or...
frida? i hear you talking. i know you are in there. let me in.
it is mark.
get rid of him!
okay, i gotta go.
I am stopping by later. I am worried about you. bye.
it is a matter of life and death.
this really is not a good time.
come on frida, I am not kidding. I am totally fucked. let me in.
i did something stupid. i had a courier job -- picking up a package from the airport. it turned out to be money -- so i kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.
so pay them back and apologize.
these guys are not the kind that will take an apology. they are the kind that will break my thumbs.
you think that story's going to make me loan you money?
it is the truth. if you would just loaned me the money last time this never would have happened.
somehow this winds up being my fault? you always blame me.
come on, I am your biggest supporter.
my bra is my biggest supporter.
i just need a place to lay low for a few days. come on, i know you hate me but you can not wanna see me at the bottom of the east river?
mark.
yeah?
wow.
take your shower.
holy shit, i do not know.
did you get rid of mark?
i do not know... I am spaced out... he was taking a shower... he must be still in there.
he is been here all night?
yeah, i guess. mark?
what happened to his tooth?
i should call the police. oh no peter. peter is the police!
do not call the police.
why not? there is been a murder.
first of all, you are my alibi. i told george i was with you last night.
what? why did you do that?
there is kind of this guy I am seeing.
you are cheating on george? jennifer, how could you?
how could i? I am helping you clean up mark's remains and you ask how could i cheat on george?
you are right. it is just, i can not cover up a murder so george will not know you are cheating.
you say murder, but you have no idea what happened. you do not remember doing it, so it is out of your control.
i think i turned into a werewolf and killed him.
why the fuck would you do that?
i could smell another woman on him.
if you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I am glad he is dead.
that is a terrible thing to say. frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
okay, let's say that this is pms- related. you think those male cops are going to understand that? you will either be locked up for murder or locked up in the looney bin. we have to keep this hidden until we figure it out ourselves.
nah, east village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
the park dude was missing an arm.
poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. and his eyes were open. that always bugs me out. do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
deal. and if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
yeah okay. i still say frida's involved. she is the last one to see two dudes alive...
she was not the last one to see them alive. whoever killed them was.
at least i finally saw the reason you could not get over mark.
you should have seen it erect.
you expecting someone?
no.
ignore it.
fuck it is the cops. peter saw me, now i have to let him in.
tell them you will meet them outside.
uh.... hi!
frida, can we come in? we need to talk to you. it is important.
uh... the buzzer's broken. I will be down in a second.
what the fuck are we going to do?
hide him.
i was thinking about becoming a cop myself. do you take a test or something or just sign up?
why would you want to be a cop?
i do not know, i guess the outfits are cool. and i want a big gun.
you heard about carlton fraser?
yes, jennifer told me. what does that have to do with me?
you had a date with carlton?
it was not a date. jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
seems you were the last to see carlton alive. and the last to see gregory alive.
what makes you think i was the last one?
he means the last that we know of.
this one walk you home too?
no. we left the restaurant, and... and i felt sick... so... so i took a cab home. alone.
you got a dog?
no, i have a cat.
how big?
see he was cheating from the get go.
he is been running money for the mafia.
no he is not. he is a courier. he picks up packages from the airport.
packages of money.
seems he is stolen money from them. he is desperate and our only lead.
one of our only leads... you had dates with both men right before they were killed.
no, no... but mark -- a jealous boyfriend gone mad. maybe he kills men you date.
mark would not hurt a fly.
but you said the bodies were ripped to pieces?
still have not figured out how he or anyone else pulled that off. never seen anything like it.
no, why?
he was ripped to shreds also. in his apartment.
peter knows something.
well if he does, he did not give you away. he must really like you.
spencer's the key here. frida is in no way associated with him. and her blood has not matched with any of the killings.
it is a bit farfetched that mark would rip guys to shreds just outta jealousy. this makes no sense.
it is like some fucking monster dropped out of the sky and killed these dudes.
like a vampire or some shit?
i think i just got my period.
does that mean this whole thing is over?
probably for three weeks or so anyway. I am not sure -- i do not get how it works.
let's do some research. I will check the libraries. you surf the web.
you are such a good friend.
so are you. look, go about your life. act like nothing's wrong. we will get to the bottom of this.
mr. grant. did you read that script i was talking about?
uh... yes. not for us. no woman in jeopardy. find me dr. quinn medicine woman. find me a true story about a crazed killer stalking beautiful women.
no.
no?
no. i quit. take your lame ass ideas, your fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove them.
very well then. is that all?
frida. i was looking for you. you changing jobs?
yeah sort of. where is lloyd?
i need to talk to you. about us. frida... i... can i carry your box?
no, i got it. it is okay.
what happened?
what happened?
i thought we were starting something... and then... i know it is unorthodox, i mean with you being involved in the case and all.
i just do not know if i should be dating anyone right now.
yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.
except mark of course.
what is that supposed to mean?
did i tell you i have the worst sense of humor and i make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
no, but thanks for the warning.
speaking of mark -- we have tried to track him down and there is no sight of him. vanished into thin air. i got a hunch he fled the country.
interesting possibility.
symptoms include loss of emotional control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells...
peter keeps asking me out.
maybe you should go out with him. if you keep avoiding him he will get suspicious. besides, what better way to not get busted than to date the cop who is investigating you.
the thing is, i really like him. i finally meet a guy i really like and I am a fuckin' werewolf.
we do not know you are a werewolf. it might never happen again. you have to get on with your life.
that is it? hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. she made us call her a different name. she would say, "you're talking to betty now" and we would leave the house for a few days.
this is a lot worse than "betty."
you can not mean that. I am sure your bark is worse than your bite.
no, my bite's a lot worse.
is it that funny?
no, it is just... no one's ever said that. and i thought if someone did ever say it, I would have to say it first and then they would sort of say "i love you too" cause they felt they had to after I would said it.
is that how you feel?
like i had to say it? no, i wanted to say it.
you did not say it.
i love you too.
what is with the squirt guns?
they are for my cat. i use them to train him not to rip up paper.
you know, I have never seen your cat.
i loaned him to jennifer. george moved out and she was lonely...
you think mafia hit?
hard to tell. looks like he is been cleaned up and he is decomposing as we speak. this case gets weirder by the minute.
it has to be frida. this makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
okay lloyd. first, no way does frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? third, she is the one in danger. she is a woman in jeopardy and you are layin' a murder rap on her. fourth, i look in her eyes and know she is no killer.
and fifth, you are dating her.
what are you talking about?
i know. i followed you. to the zoo, to her house, to your house...
what the fuck are you following me for? I am not a suspect here.
which brings up an interesting point. i was not following you. i was following the suspect. and you just happened to be there...
"paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental problem..." nothing about turning into a werewolf.
check out what i found.
this is from a scientist in france, madame sconce. "the original werewolves were females. they became werewolves on the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman's cycle. my suspicion is that the only cure is true love."
great so all i have to do is fall in love? like i have not tried that for the past 24 years.
"the female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." see i knew you never loved mark.
who is this madame sconce? let's find her and talk to her.
she died at age 34 in the 1800's. they thought she was crazy. she was banished from her town. seems her husband shot her.
guess she never found true love.
the weird thing is... he shot her with a silver bullet.
so... she was a werewolf. do you think we can believe all this?
what choice do we have?
so what do i do?
fall in love.
i think i already have.
your breasts feel larger.
they do? oh no...
no, it is a good thing. i like it. everything about you is great. i like how you do not shave your legs. women are so much sexier when they are natural.
i did shave... do i seem hairy? peter laughs.
no. but i do not mind hairy. are you okay?
I am cleaning my stove.
you scared the shit out of me. i thought you were killing yourself.
i tried to kill myself -- earlier. it does not work. i think i need silver bullets. so i got depressed and when I am depressed i clean.
you will get through this. you were fine for over three weeks.
I am just afraid I will hurt peter. i think i love him.
remember what madame sconce said. if you love him he will be fine.
but how do i know if i really love peter? and if he really loves me?
i guess you will find out.
no. i can not take that chance. I would rather kill myself.
no. i will not let you do that.
the werewolf always dies at the end. did not you see "american werewolf in london?"
i think george knows.
about mark? carlton?
about benito.
did i kill a guy named benito?
no, he is the guy I am having an affair with.
i thought you and george were getting married.
we were -- i was just so tempted... it was sort of a test. i think after sleeping with benito i know i want to be with george. but now george knows about benito and he does not want to be with me!
i wish i only had your problems.
sorry -- i should not go on about myself at a time like this. are you sure you are going to be okay?
yes, just check on me once a day for the next three days. then the pms should be over.
hello?
frida? you okay? look, i think i know what happened to mark. i want to help. I am coming over.
no! do not come over. peter... i... i do not want to see you anymore. ever.
what? is there someone else?
yes, sort of. i mean no, not really.
yes or no? frida, can not you just be honest with me?
you at least owe me the truth.
you want the truth? remember i tried to tell you something the other day?
yes, your pms. frida i can deal with that.
no you can't. it... it gets so bad that i become a werewolf.
if you do not like me, just say so. you do not have to make up some bullshit like you are a werewolf.
i knew you would not believe me! just go away. go very far away!
my girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
what makes her think that?
she says she is on the rag every time i get called in to investigate a murder.
so... they are on some cycle. the murders... gregory... then 28 days later... carlton.
and that was 28 days ago today.
did we get those dna tests back?
just this morning. animal hairs were found all over the victims.
what kind of animal?
can not figure out the species. similar to a wolf. they are jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. am not that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
go away. i might hurt you.
I am not afraid. frida! i love you.
peter i love you too but...
i do not think you will hurt me.
how do you know?
i do not think you would. no matter what form you take.
i can not take that chance... i could not live with myself if i did anything to you.
i have the silver bullets in case i need to protect myself. does that make you feel better?
be careful!
can not you bite me and then I will be like you?
no. it does not work that way. men can not get pms. unfortunately.
I am staying here with you tonight. there is no getting rid of me.
i knew you would not kill me.
maybe we should have children. i do not think I would kill the father of my child.
we can work this out. other couples have worse problems.
worse than this?
sure. cheating, lying. what is a little werewolf a few days a month? we can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
what about... those guys... i might have...
no way can anything be proved. all they have are some wolf hairs. no one believes in werewolves.
I am so sorry... i... i could not help it. you know i did not mean to... to do any of that.
i know. the important thing is that it stop.
I am going to take a shower.
okay.
hello?
frida? you okay?
never been better. peter spent the night. i must really love him. he is still alive.
oh thank god. maybe this whole thing is really over.
god i hope so. hey can i call you later? peter's still here. he is in the shower.
sure. see ya.
here's a towel.
thanks.
