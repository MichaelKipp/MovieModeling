you look a like you could use a friend.  you know, i'll never forget my first day at camp. boy, i was so nervous that i...
hey--whaddya say, we need another muskrat to join our sunshine circle. scurry up!  isn't fun great!
college was entertaining, wichita, but after 40 days and 40 nights of this, i really think we're going to get to know each...
ooh look, time to confiscate my first water balloon...
go stand by the flagpole.
sorry about all that...i'm your cit-- jasper.

well, the first week of camp has swhooshed on by and i thought this a perfect time to finally pow-wow. i think we should discuss--
we need more ritalin. can't we just grind it into the munchkins' food?
who wants to go tell the anti-christ to take a "time-out?"
talia, just because you happen to be jewish, doesn't mean you can make fun of someone desecrating the lord's body...
yes, it does.
okay, okay, just don't everyone talk at once...first of all, little jason has a learning disability...
yeah, his lack of intelligence. sorry, wendy, but as learning disabilities go, stupidity is often overlooked.
next to "boring," "sucks" is the most painfully overused word in the current english language. i thought if i could reverse the meaning of "sucks" so it means something positive, i don't know...it would be vaguely revolutionary. it's kind of my social experiment for the summer.

that's not what i was worried about.

you and wichita go to school together, right?  have you two ever...
that would be a no.
that wants to be a yes.
i don't know what i'm doing. i know he only likes me as a friend. he's just so...everything--i know he only likes me as a--but it came up that he used to be a camp counselor and i used to be a camp counselor...

...and it hurts too much to keep these feelings inside me any longer...
talia, you know how important our friendship is to me and i would never do anything to...
"...how important our friendship..." not that old--oh god, what have i done?
talia, you're a wonderful person...
stop, stop, what was i thinking...out in the wilderness.  under the stars. i've ruined every--

they wouldn't be a bit surprised..

i don't know about you dickweeds, but i gotta go take a nice, long juicy dump.
you are to be executed at dawn anyway.  might as well commit the crime. go to her, wichita...
you're all making me blush...
wendy, don't be afraid to get a little stupid and contagious. the kids don't understand that this is our summer, too. we shouldn't have to put our lives on hold to be their butlers.
i just don't know about this whole actual sexuality thing--how do you go from being friends with a guy to wanting to put the thing he uses to go to the bathroom with in your mouth?
eavesdropping, eh?  hear anything good?
man, it's not like i don't know about women. i had this babysitter...
hey.
hey--that coffee?  you're a goddess. gimme, gimme...so what you gals talk about?
oh you know, bosnia, the importance of the right to vote...
yeah, we talked about sex, too. oberon must be sweating in his sleep.
we had fun. i even got along with talia-- for about three minutes. i don't know why she hates me so much...
yes you do.
yeah. i guess i do.
talia's a rock. she'll be fine...
ann taylor would have paid a lot more, but i wouldn't trade this experience for the world. sometimes the first time you understand anything is when you have to explain it to someone younger-- you think i'm a big dork don't you?
i think your passion is terrific.
i think your condescension is even better.
we have more in common than you think, wendy dear. i loved summer camp when i was young and i love it now. it's important. between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic cable, and the goddamn internet, it's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul. out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who i once was...i get recharged. now who's the dork?
gosh, this is really a great conversation--i can't believe i said that out loud.
you know, this reminds me of the time we were talking about something and then just started kissing...
do you really not believe in god?
it's okay, there's a lot of things i don't believe in...
what else don't you believe in?
talking while kissing.
so this is it, anybody you don't agree about everything with can't be your friend...
iunno.
"iunno." i'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. i'm sorry for sounding hostile, but i'm not sorry for...
don't be. don't be sorry for your thoughts. they make me...react. i don't know...all i know is that i can't go through another summer where i <u>almost</u> did something.
what are you doing?
nothing.
you know you just do this for shock value. it's not shocking.
when did pretending to be bored become a sign of superiority?  are you mad at me for giving the cabin new haircuts or are you just still miserably pining for wichita's lightning rod?
geez, what time is it?  i have to go feed big chief oberon...you're right, i miss him. wichita, that is.  i really want to be with him, but i can't bring myself to--are you a lesbian or are you...
i didn't realize i had to declare a major.
why do you even like me?
you remind me of me when i was...i guess i was never like you. so cute. so questioning.
i'm not a nai-ive little...
uh-huh.
no, they're not from wendy.
your secret admirer?
not so secret anymore. don't look all at once...behind the pine...dorothy from cabin seven.
i guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. like you.
hey, i thought i wasn't your type.
wichita--you're everybody's type. but seriously, don't worry about it. i get my occasional crushes.

it's funny, when i first met you i thought you were such a weirdo...i still think you're a nut, but you're my nut.
yeah...are we going to do it or what? i still haven't packed.
why are you being so grouchy--this is an important night for us...
adam. dollface. we had a physical relationship that served a purpose and now...
but, but that was before we started sharing stuff. before i told you how i cried when peepers died. i never told anyone that before.
and this peepers was your...dog?  if it makes you feel better, i probably wasn't paying attention.
that doesn't make me feel better! why are you being like this?
don't raise your voice at--i gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
stop it, stop it, you satanic whore!
you think you're so...but you're just...
that's it, adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...ooh, that's it.

nobody really changes at summer camp. they merely find out who they are and become it more than ever.  you can't be helped, wichita. i'm not sure you can be punished, either. but let's find out...
how do you mean?                                            ]

i'm sorry. it just...it seems silly. like kissing a girl.
clever observation. go back to wichita.  oh that's right, you can't.
...sorry...
this is not the way it was supposed to-- i was going to start writing a children's book using input from all-- i don't even like smoking!
one day they'll find a cure for aids. they'll never find one for sex. it's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.
yeah. and?
it's just funny...who needs a serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw when we have ourselves.
there you are!  man, i don't know how to thank...
eric...you can't be like me. you have to be better. i'm not the guy you think i am...
of course you are. you don't know what i was like before i met you. you're like the best counselor ever.
i'm gay. like you didn't know.
andrew. you're not gay; you're ten. you shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
you mean you didn't have any gay thoughts when you were my age...
well, uh...promise me you won't do anything until you're 18.
did you wait until you were 18?
i'll bet you're glad i waited until the last day to have this conversation.
you have no idea. now run away.
summer would have been a lot less without you. you're a true friend, donald.
was there a night that i got really drunk and declared that i never loved anyone as much as i loved you?
no.
that's good. i wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
