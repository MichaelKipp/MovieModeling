I would come to the realization that everything I would based my life on was false. and that my life had no meaning.
he gets this way when he hits over eighty-five.
it seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. i was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. everything was futile and nothing had value.
that is a tragedy. can i finish my story please? i began my search for meaning. i was a catholic, jew, scientologist, sufi, buddhist. i went to a psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. and they all pretty much say the same stuff.
a jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? you are insane.
basically the same thing. in a very evolved, esoteric way.
insane.
to make a long story short...
jesus...
overflowing with love.
oh i see. you got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
you open 'em up and there is the sayings, stories, little bites of insight. it is the p.p.p. six day week.
so you eat-- read it everyday?
yes.
and these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
correct.  that is for you. keep it.
how was your day, today, sir?
effective. but to tell you the truth, I have lost my passion for work.
do you like the people you work with?
i work alone.
that is it then. that is it. I have always been alone. that is why I am a good driver. i can handle it. see, i can think on my feet. i survive, I am a thinker. and i can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it do not bother me. some people can not do it! some people are ranting and raving, "tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, i can't-- i want a go!" where you going to go? you are going to wind up back in your garage at seven of the clock at night. you am not going nowhere. you leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. what is the big deal, right?
you understand the psychology of the job.
i do. some guys can not adjust to it; they can not handle it.
you look like you are far away. far away and thinking about other things. I am right about that, are not i?
no.
well, let's just say that sometimes I am right. sometimes you are.
sometimes i am. sometimes. it is only natural.
it is only natural....
i been looking at you, and I have decided that i want to share something with you.
okay.
because your problem is you are bored. and you have a very big mind.  i am part of what i call a brain syndicate.
i am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. we can think with each other, think for each other. i can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. running someone else's brain.
up on the right.
and when you think of it, it is not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world, is it?
...tell them that is not my problem. i was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. see you tomorrow, marcella.
wait. i have mr. grocer for you.
patch him through....
what do you want?
I am setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
like a union?
like a club. work less, make more.
thank you, no.
we could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I am willing to let you in on the ground floor.
and you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....
it is a free-market evolution. you will wake up to it... c'mon kid. we used to run together when you were a rookie. i do not want to run against you. this thing's real. everybody's in.
not me. so do not paw at me with your dirty little guild.
I am going to get you, kid.
throw that away.
this?
do not tease me. you know what i do for a living.
it is from one of those p.o. boxes. how was the trip?
tedious. i now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
all of it?
and not show it to me. ever again.
that is going to cost.
I will pay.
they are not happy, sir.
I am not happy.
they say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
he didn't.
they blame you for the compromise.
and they want me to make up for it.
in detroit. this weekend.
tell them that is impossible. i need my normal lead time.
they were very upset.
would you describe their position as inflexible?
intractable, sir. you leave tonight.
and sir, i also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
there is nothing to be done about it.
i liquidated the last account in zurich, and split it into two new ones in estonia.
good. what else? anything interesting?
mmm, not really. but you are going to love this one.
enough?
never enough.
but it is a greenpeace boat. it would be so easy.
i have scruples. next.
paperwork on the detroit thing. it is a full dossier. very comprehensive.
do not forget your identity.
see you next week.
why do not you want to go to your high school reunion?
it is in michigan. honestly, what do i have in common with those people? or with anyone?
you went to school with these people.
come on.
we have spent a lot of time discussing those years. remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
should not you be taking notes?
tell me about your vision of the reunion.
how do you know?
i just know.
say more.
they will have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. and they can talk about what they do. what am i going to say?  "i killed the president of paraguay with a fork."
you need not be so frank with me about your work.
why not. i trust you. you could not turn me in because of doctor-patient privilege... and i do not want to be "withholding"... and i know where you live.
you know where i live?
we are both professionals, oatman.
i think what you fear martin is domesticity. it is the greatest fear that men have who belong to western culture. it is centuries old. like king phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "well, would not it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the saracens."  so he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
so you are saying that ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? he just wanted to fuck around?
yes.
mmm.
and how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
uneasy. dispassionate. bored. it is just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I am starting to think I have been in the business too long. last week i did a guy younger than me.
anyway, that never use to happen. i was always the prodigy. now I am just one of the guys.
maybe some of the discomfort you are feeling is... guilt. remorse. over the innocent people you have killed.
if i show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. i do not care about that stuff, anyway.
what stuff?
morality.
go to your reunion, martin. see those people and discover what they mean to you. try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
if i get antsy I will kill a few small animals.
you always say that. you always say that. I am telling you, you never met the man.
seventeen months ago i was posting a walk in lisbon, and he was there. he never saw me. but i saw him, though.
lisbon?
in portugal, yes.
here's the news: he has not been in portugal since '90. i know that from the file. why do not you read the file, man?
in fact, i think i talked with him, in bonn.
i bought a new rug.
that is wonderful, mom.
what is a revival tent?
it is a place where religious people--
marlin perkins and jim!
jim?
his assistant. he acted like marlin's son, only he wasn't. at least they never said he was... i bet they were lovers, faggots. yes, gay lovers. wild kingdom my ass!
it is good to see you. I am sure you are curious about what I have been doing.
i spoke to your father the other day.
i imagine that would be rather difficult.
nature made him then broke the mold.
they told me you are taking lithium, mom.
yes, they give me headaches. i have a headache.
you have a headache?
i have a headache. you have a headache?
no, i do not have one.
you do not have a headache. i have a headache.
we had a good laugh, did not we?
yeah. i guess we did.
why do not you return this car and borrow mine? have debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
i think I will go see debi today.
of course you will.
i can not think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given i left and never said goodbye to her.
take care of her. she is a keeper.
yeah...
and a leader. did not she meet castro on foreign exchange?
i have always thought about her and missed her.
i just play my own collection.
it is nice to see you again.
how long has it been?
since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
ten years, i think. what i miss?
well, let me see... they tore down the george orwell monument and put up a bust of george michael. main street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. i was married and divorced. and grosse pointe is now officially the new sister city to lower hutt, new zealand. we have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
here is now there. there is here.
tell me about yourself.
I am in california most of the time. traveling a lot on business. that is about it, really.
that is it?
not much else.
what is your business?
I am a professional killer.
professional killer. do you get dental with that?
well, i got to go. but I will come back.
okay.
well?
i do not think so.
well, remember when frysal's men paid off the deejay in cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
--nooo--
--yes. and the munich olympics in '72. a local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened.
that is strictly bader-meinhof stuff.
it was the plo.
whatever.
all right mystery man. i want some answers. let's recap. spring of '84. two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. the girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. the boy never shows up, until now. so, what is the question?
where have i been?
more like what happened? what happened, mr. blank?
i do not know exactly. i could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... i thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
--torn down in the name of convenience--
--and i guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... i suppose the most important thing, really. i do not know. anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. it is my shrink, really.
ohhh. you are in therapy too, marty?
you see someone?
uh, no. so you are back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me. the question now is, do i allow you... access... to my being?
marty! it is me. paul.
paul?
you are leaving me hanging here...
so what happened to you?
same thing that happened to you-- i stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. got in. got on the team. i joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why do not you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, paul.
fair enough.
god it is great to see you.
you too.
so when are you authorized to use deadly force?
well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. but our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? this badge does not mean that i am a peace officer.
so it is not a meaningful symbol, or anything. that badge is just the badge of your company. if i look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... to shoot me.
to shoot you. correct.
how did you get this job?
well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course...
wow.
debi's house.
kind of crept up on you, did not it?
no. you drove us here.
yeah, but it is still kind of eerie, is not it?
no.
ten years. what happened!?
i freaked out, joined the army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I am a professional killer.
thank you.
he sells bmw's?
he sold me this bad boy.
how could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
he gave me a great deal.
mein dealer.
bob...
what?
it is me. martin blank.
really...? so what?
okay. see you later.
are you going to the reunion?
no. I am not going. is that why you are here?
that is part of it.
well, you will have a ball. you seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. the car, the suit, the watch. the look. that just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
it is always the little things.
yep.
okay. let's catch up. you go first.
well, there is not much to tell.
I am sure you have done worthwhile things in the last ten years. you have had experiences.
bad experiences.
you met people.
bad people.
watched television?
bad television.
jesus. marty. you are pathetic. it sounds like you need a shockabuku.
what is that?
it is a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
that would be good.
i figured i could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
yes.
unbelievable.
seven it is.
I will think about it.
this is not good.
I will do it tomorrow.
what is it look like?
it is fine.
you have not looked at the dossier.
I have looked at it.
you have.
yes. it is the same as usual. nothing remarkable about it at all.
i have to call the client and give them a reason why you are late.
tell them my house exploded.
I will call them and tell them you are taking your time. being a professional.
okay, call them. fine. oh-- and if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that is be great.
will do.
are you there?
yes.
pick me up at my father's house at around seven. and do not be late this time.
hello...?
this night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
you are fucking psycho.
do not rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
i wish he would do his job already so we could do our job.
we can not do our job unless he does his job.
why do not we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
do his job? I am not a cold-blooded killer.
wait a minute--
-look. you want to kill a good guy, but not be a bad guy, you wait until a bad guy kills the good guy, and then you come in and kill the bad guy, and then you are the good guy.
so if we do his job, we are the bad guys. if we do our job, we are the good guys.
yup.
i want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. english muffin for the bread. and a coffee.
whole-grain pancakes. and an egg- white omelette.
come on, live a little. I am sorry about the incident yesterday.
no harm no foul.
a little misunderstanding among my associates.
i told them to kill you and they didn't.
hard to get good help these days.
but since we are both here, i think it is time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
i did not get into this business to have "associates." and i do not want to join your goddamned union. "loner-- " "loner gunman." get it? "on my own." that is the whole point. why do not you become a cop, or something. you can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!
no deal.
fine. but we are not going to let you do your job. because we are going to do it. and then, after we do your job, we are going to do another little job...
is that right?
yeah-- after i shoot you through the fucking forehead I am going to fuck you in the bullethole.
nice talk, sugarmouth.
flowers. that is funny.
as long as i get the laugh.
here. let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
you look beautiful.
okay... hold on...
...let me get my coat.
I will just help myself to a cocktail.
good evening, mr. newberry.
good evening, mr. blank.
how are you? how is business?
martin, i do not know where you have been since you abandoned my daughter ten years ago, and i do not care. it was good that you left, and I am glad you did. so what do you want to talk about? you have grown up a bit. maybe i had you figured wrong.
how is that?
i visualized you, in a haze, as one of the slackster, flannel-wearing, coffeehouse-misanthropes I have been seeing in newsweek.
i took the other road. I am more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. i love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. and you?
oh, you know me, martin. I am the same old sell-out baby-boomer, exploiting the oppressed i got shot for at kent state. but why do not we have a drink and forget the whole thing?
why not?
so what are you doing with your life now, son?
I am a professional killer.
that is good.
do you want to get a drink first?
i think they will probably have booze there.
right.
what else? say more.
saw my mom... I am with debi, and I am on my way to the reunion.
okay. repeat this after me.
out loud?
...i am at home with the me. i am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
this is me breating.
he is falling for her. look at him.
he using her.
you are wrong. look at his face.
one cannot love and kill.
i love. i kill.
shoulda brought my gun.
what?
welcome back! I am arlene oslott- joseph.
I am martin blank.
marty, you have not changed a bit!
do not say that.
we had pictures put on, that way everybody knows who everybody was!
wonderful.
so, what are you doing now?
whatever i can get away with.
hey, ken. how have you been?
hello martin. how have you been?
not bad. you?
hello, bob.
hey, bob.
I am an attorney. I am with moss, brice & fromeyer.
that sounds pretty interesting...
sometimes. I am in divorce, mainly. some property. some personal injury.
those all seem kind of related...
well... i have to take this over to debi.
here. take my card. wait a minute... here's a special one. for top-shelf clients.
bob. bob destephano.
what?
I am dan. dan koretzky.
computer guy.
yeah... hey, i saw you at your dad's dealership the other day.
i sell bmw's. what do you do?
not much, actually. my software company just went public so I am just... hanging out, really.
remember high school?
sure. listen. why do not you join us up in the grandstands?
--yes. actually we just bought that little frank lloyd wright on pine avenue... debi's a social worker and i mow down insurance claims at aetna--
we have not seen each other since high school.
but wait. i still do not understand what you do.
i work at kentucky fried chicken.
you do not.
yes i do.
you don't...
in the corporate offices.
oh... really?
yeah...
what do you do?
i sell biscuits to the southland.
you do not.
it is what i do.
you are so funny...
i sell biscuits and gravy all over the southland--
--stop it--
you know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? i move all of those--
--no.
sometimes we sell them to mcdonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.
which would you rather...?
okay... would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former president george herbert walker bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
soft. I will take the junkie otter, clearly! I would let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... okay. would you rather make love to the candied corpse of phyllis diller--
--she's not dead---
it is just a game...! alright. candied diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
wow. i have to give this some thought.
no time.
okay, then. clearly candied diller.
even though i left, you never left me. not just memory but a substance in my blood.
like heroin?
too junky-kitschy. deeper, deeper.
like love?
could be. the physical substance of love.
looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
if he does our job, he is our job.
i get it.
so. you and debi. gonna hit that shit again?
fine, bob. how are you?
never better.
really?
ahhh... it is all fucked up. nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. one day you are twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it...
you could have been a contender, huh?
what am i gonna do?
what do you want to do?
i want to be an actor.
then express yourself, bob.
have you seen debi newberry?
nope.
the more things change, the more they goddamned well stay the same.
i guess.
what the hell happened to you?
i was catching up with bob destephano.
as long as you had a good time.
it did not work out.
that is too bad.
i have to get my head back into my work.
work's good for the soul.
when you see debi, tell her I am sorry.
see you in ten years.
he was trying to kill you, right!
yes.
not the other way around...?
no.
is it something you have done?
it is something i do...
...about five years now.
get the fuck outta here.
seriously, when i left, i joined the army and took the service exam. they found my psych results fit a certain profile. a certain "moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... i was loaned out to a cia- sponsored program. it is called "mechanical operations." we sort of found each other...
you are a government spook?
i was, but no... yes... i was before, but now I am not. it is irrelevant, really. the idea of governments, nations, it is mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. but I will tell you something, until about five months ago, i really enjoyed my work.
jesus christ!
then i started losing my taste for it. which usually means your time is up. but then i realized it was something entirely different... i started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
okay. great, martin, that is just great. meaning to life... mmm....
like, that there is a point? an organic connection between all living things.
let me help you along, martin. you are a sociopath!
a sociopath kills for no reason. i kill for money.
you never could have kept this from me.
i was leaving.
that is probably a good idea.
will you come with me?
I am staying here.
what if i come back?
I will hide.
you do not get to have me. you are a monster, I am a human being. we are not going to mate.
you do not understand...
that is because i speak human, and you speak monster.
it is okay. it is martin the door begins to open revealing debi and newberry.
i know what i do is not moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you would see a man worth loving.
do not listen to him, he is a professional.
did you see blank in there?
no...
good. for a second there i thought we were in trouble.
...how about i sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
okay.
there you go. i left it blank.
excellent. here they come.
you kill people.
i have no illusions about the future. what is, is. we make choices. and we become the sum total of our choices. i can live with that.
other people can't.
