jesus. we have been at this for six months.
i know.
and you have not made an ounce of progress.
i know.
but you said you have the worst reputation.
i do.
do not you want to change that?
let me tell you something, doctor. chicks love a guy with a bad rap. they say they don't, but they do not mean it. they all think that they are the ones that are going to "save me." the trick is to let them think it is true.
i think that is all the time we have for today.
same time next week?
no. this is going to be our last session.
why? i like spending time with you. you know, you are quite attractive for a woman your age. you have killer legs. killer.
this is not a joke. your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I am trying to help you.
do not be insecure, doc. you are a big help.
you think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. it does not work, sebastian.
it works a little.
no it doesn't. i see right through you.
you do?
i hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. it is going to get you into trouble.
well, you do not have to get nasty about it.
my daughter, rachel.
yummy.
do not even think about it. rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending princeton this fall. she is way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
really? care to make a wager on that?
good luck, sebastian.
what, nervous I am going to win?
would you please leave.
hi, mom.
honey, is something wrong?
he told me he loved me and i believed him.
who told you?
you do not know him. I am so stupid.
alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
would you cut the psycho babble bullshit, mom. there is pictures of me on the internet.
nudie pictures, what do you think?
jesus christ, how can you be so stupid?
i do not know. he was just so charming. all he did was talk about how i had killer legs and how we wanted to photograph them. things just got out of hand from there.  mom? are you there? mom?  mother!!!!
i can not tell you how happy we are that cecile is going to be attending oakwood with you this fall. you have always been an inspiration to beau and i on raising her. we just hope she can rise to the high standards which you have set for her.
I will do my best.
what was that?
i was thanking her. vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
you are too kind.
how do you do it? i mean with all peer pressuring that goes on in high school. where do you get your strength?
i know this sounds corny, but whenever i feel temptations of peer pressure, i...  turn to god and he helps me through the problem. call me an anachronism, but it works.
that is beautiful.
what are the boys like?
cecile, is that the best you can do?  you must forgive her, kathryn. she is never been in a co-educational atmosphere before.
do not worry, it is totally understandable. most of the boys that matriculate at oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
like your step-brother sebastian. i can not believe they did not expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
my father just took me on a trip to australia.
how are things down under? blossoming i hope.
cecile's attending oakwood in the fall.
outstanding.
what year are you in?
I am what you would call a fifth year senior.
but i thought high school is only four years.
it is, unless you are a fuck up, like myself.
I will call you later and we will get together and plan your curriculum.
thanks.  nice meeting you.
do you care to tell me what mrs. white-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
I am just taking the poor girl under my wing.
lovely. how is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying bali? zipping through my inheritance per usual?
hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
oh, poor baby. well you can relax. i have a mission for you.
what?
sorry.
in any event, my feelings were hurt when i learned that he had fallen for someone else. someone chaste... pure... innocent.
you do not mean?
i do not find this very funny,
so that is what this is all about.  we will get together and plan your curriculum.
keep your friends close and your enemies closer. when i get through with her, she will be the premier blow job queen of the tri-state area and poor little court's heart will be shattered.
why go through cecile? why not just attack court?
because if there is an attack made on court it could be traced back to me. i can not allow that to happen. everybody loves me and i intend to keep it that way.
i see your point... though why should i care?
i need you to seduce our young cecile. introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
sounds intriguing.
she is quite cute you know. young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie.
why not?
oh come on, kathryn. it is too easy. "but i thought high school was only four years." i mean, please. she knows nothing. she is seen nothing. i could have her under the table at au bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. i have a reputation to uphold.
oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
that was just simple revenge. what i have planned requires sheer genius.
I am not interested in the latest dating tips from jonathan taylor thomas.
shut up and turn to page 64.
jesus christ, is she for real?
oh yes. I have read it over and over again. this baby's the real deal. daddy's little angel. a paradigm of chastity and virtue.
b.f.d. what do you plan to do? fly to kansas and woo little dorothy.
it just so happens we are not in kansas anymore. our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at oakwood. she is staying with my aunt up in connecticut while daddy sells his house. can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? it will be my greatest victory.
you do not stand a chance. even this is out of your league.
care to make a wager on that?
I will think about it...
oh well, duty calls. time to add another chapter to my work of art.
oh gee, your journal. could you be more queer?
could you be more desperate to read it?
what are the terms?
if you lose, then that hot little porsche of yours is mine.
and if i win?
I will give you something you have been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
be more specific.
in english.  I will fuck your brains out.
what makes you think I would go for that bet? that is a seventy thousand dollar car.
because I am the only person you can not control and it kills you.
you can put it anywhere.
even there?
it would feel so yummy.
it is a beautiful home you have here mrs. rosemond.
thank you, annette. chance hill has been with my family for over sixty years. does your family do much riding?
my mother and i used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
I am sorry about that.
my grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so i would come over and ride all the time.
I am familiar with a lot of breeders in the mid-west. what is his name?
ben schwarz.
schwarz. jewish?
german.
does not ring a bell.
so what year are you going into?
junior.
got a boyfriend back home?
no.
why not?
i do not know. relationships seem too distracting. I would rather concentrate on my studies.
you a lesbo?
no.
are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
i was just being honest. you happen to have a nice ass. sorry.
i read your teen beat manifesto.
you did?
i must say i found it rather appalling.
that is a first. most people praised me for it.
most people are morons. i mean who are you to knock what you have never experienced?
i was not knocking anything. it is just my belief that people should not actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
oh really?
take yourself. you have slept with several women. are you happier because of it?
how do you know I have been with several women?
a friend wrote me.
well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
I am sorry. i did not mean to upset you... but you still did not answer the question.
who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
it is not really important.
fine, forget it. it is obvious that we are not going to be friends.
why are you being so dramatic?
look, I have got a lot of problems and I am trying to deal with them and the last thing i need is people spreading shit about me.
alright, i said i was sorry.  can we start over again? i think we have gotten off on the wrong foot.
oh, i suck. i suck.
relax. it is okay. take a deep breath.
pleased to meet you.
likewise I am sure.
ronald is one of the few high school students attending juliard. he is composing his first opera.
it is based on the life of doctor martin luther king.
doctor king is my favorite.
unbelievable. some fag, no offense -
- none taken -
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
any ideas who it could be?
blaine, if i knew who it was that person would not be alive right now.
where did you say she is from?
kansas. who the hell do i know in kansas?
greg mcconnell.
the football stud?
he is from kansas city. i would not be surprised if he was your rat.
it would make sense. mcconnell hates me. i fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
i do not think that bothered him.
what do you mean?
let's just say greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
are you shitting me?
i shit you not. mcconnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. we would go at it for a while, then as soon as he would cum, he starts freaking out. you know -  "what are you doing, man? I am not a fag. I will kick your ass if you say anything."  it is like, for christsakes greg, you are gay, deal with it. the only reason why i let him continue with his charade is because he is got a mouth like a hoover.
too bad he is in kansas this summer.
not anymore. football team started practice last week. he is already called me to hook up.
really. you think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
hmmm. i do believe bravo is showing spartacus on television tonight.
outstanding.
do not think it is not going to cost you.
no problem. just make sure your front door is unlocked. shall we say the "stroke of midnight" no pun intended?
so, rumor has it that you went on a date with court reynolds. i hear he is very nice.
he is alright.  he kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over fourth of july.
really? bulimic headcase.
what a loser she must be.  anyhow, court's invited me to the hamptons for labor day weekend.
that is great.
you think so? i do not know. i guess I am just scared.
what are you scared of?
ah duh. boys. I have never even gone to first base with a guy. what do i do?
have not you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
eww. no. that is gross.
it is not gross. how else do you think girls learn? here turn around and face me.
are you for real?
do you want to learn or not?
i guess. it still sounds gross.
see that was not so bad.
it was nothing.
let's try it again, only this time I am going to stick my tongue in your mouth. when i do that i want you to massage my tongue with yours. that is what first base is.
okay.
eyes closed.
that was cool.
maybe you should try it on your friend ronald sometime.
what are you saying?
oh come on cecile. he is crazy about you.
is it that obvious?
that is so romantic. have you responded?
no.
well do you like him?
i do not know.
cecile, we just made out in the middle of central park. you can trust me.
i do like him. i can not stop thinking about him.
listen to me. your mother must never know. never.
okay.
did you hide the letters?
yes. they are in this antique doll house in my room.
i want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
why?
cecile if there is one thing I am great at it is love letters. with my help, he will be eating out of the palm of your hand. perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
you would do that for me?
of course i would. we are friends, right?
best friends.
excuse me. excuse me!
you talking to me?
look, i know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I am trying to read.
what'cha reading?
the fountainhead.
great book.
you have read the fountainhead?
several times. I am not as dumb as i act, you know. when howard roark makes love to dominique francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
romantic? he rapes her.
that is a matter of opinion.
you need help.
why do not you come join me for a swim and we will discuss it.
at this hour? i do not think so.
oh come on. quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
please.
give me a minute. I will be right down.
thank you.
fuck her yet?
I am working on it.
loser.
blow me.
call me later.
okay.
you know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
what? another letter from your friend?
this is my favorite part.  even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. he has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
you know you could at least have the decency of telling me who is badmouthing me so i might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. how do you know it is not some girl who is pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
i sincerely doubt it.
give me the fucking letter.
the last thing i need is you going into my room searching for this while I am away.
is that the last thing you need? my your clever.
how is the water?
refreshing.
about what?
about what you said today in the stable. I am not a happy person.
i never said that.
you implied it.
look, i did not mean to give you a hard time.
no, it is okay. i mean i look at you with all your morals and values and well, you seem to be happy in your choices. i envy you. no bullshit.
thank you.
seriously, you are amazing. you have everything going for you.  you are smart, you are beautiful, you are determined. you are everything i want in a girlfriend.
shut up.
i was not kidding. I would like to take you out.
look, I am flattered but, seriously it could never work.
why not?
because you act like a pig.
do you deny that there is an attraction between us?
i don't... i do not want to answer that... look we are friends.
you do not find me cute? come on, look at these muscles.
I am sorry, but you are not my type.
fine. friends it is. i can live with that.
you are naked.
it is my house.
that is repulsive.
what is the big deal? we are friends. have not you ever seen your friends naked before?
oh baby... oh baby...
baby?  right on time.
hey blaine, did i leave my... holy shit.
jesus!
greg, is that you under the covers?
get out of here.
whoa!
i told you to lock the door.
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
please do not tell anyone. this could ruin my career.
your career? what about your family? can you imagine the humiliation your father's going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge- packer.
annette harrison? i do not know what you are talking about.
come on greg. you are the only one who knows her. the truth will save you.
i swear on my life, i never said a word to her about you.
i think he is telling the truth valmont. greg could not write a grocery list let alone a letter.
alright, i believe you. stop crying. your secret's safe with me.
need a lift?
no thank you.
how are you today?
give it up.
oh right, last night. i guess i owe you an apology.
I am not going to speak to you till you realize that you can not intimidate me.
i said i was sorry.
it was fine.
i wish i could say the same for myself. i was up thinking about you all night.
i thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
yes, well unfortunately i can not just switch the "on" button to "off." the sad fact of the matter is that you have unintentionally rubbed off on me.
and that is a bad thing?
I am trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
I am sorry, but I am not here to be your savior.
well try this one on for size. i think I am falling in love with you.
you do not even know me.
do not you believe in love at first sight?
yes, but only when it is mutual. and this is far from mutual.
ouch. do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
i can't. I am seeing a friend.
who?
that is none of your business.
how about tonight?
I am busy.
doing what?
that is also none of your business.
tell me what to do, annette. how can i win your heart. I will do anything. i can not get you out of my mind.
you truly want to do something to make me happy?
yes.
and you promise to abide by it?
without question.
alright.  i want you to leave and go back to new york.
what?
if that is a problem, then I will make arrangements to stay with some friends.
I will leave this afternoon. happy?
it is not about being happy. you and i can not -
he told you he is failing in love with you? I have never known him to say those words before.
really? i thought he said it all the time.
that is not his style. one thing i can say about valmont. he always speaks the truth.
nothing.
is there a mutual feeling between you two?
no. i mean. i do not know.  what else do you know about him?
not a whole lot. we take some classes together. he is got a bad rep, but it is mostly bullshit.
what do you mean?
well, a lot of people are jealous cause he is loaded.
i do not know. I have been hearing some awful things about him.
from who?
i can not tell you. I am sworn to secrecy.
annette, how long have we known each other?
forever.
now it is my job to look out for you. you are like a kid sister to me. do i look like some kind of gossip queen?
you promise not to say anything?
on my mother's life.
okay...
positive.
did you do everything i asked you to?
yes.
you told her i never said i love you before?
yes!
you told her that people are jealous cause I am loaded?
yes!
and you think she bought it?
I am pretty sure she did.
pretty sure or sure sure?
she bought it.
I will be in touch.
you would not believe what--
shhh.
well, i guess it is getting late. please thank kathryn for the use of her steinway.
I will see you tomorrow.
absolutely.
what is wrong with you?
you ready for this? I have recently discovered that our good friend mrs. caldwell is the one who sent the letter to annette urging her to stay away from me.
interesting.
i now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. any luck corrupting her daughter?
no.
call cecile up and get her to come over. I will bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
the plot thickens. it appears that cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
ooo, I am sure mrs. caldwell will love that.
not to mention court reynolds. unfortunately, ronald's moving with the speed of a special olympic bobsledder.
what is your plan of attack?
i rat cecile out to mommy. mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. boo hoo.
but who will they turn to for help?
I am at your service.
thank you. mmmm, that feels good.
oh sis. you are so tense.
i hate when things do not go my way. it makes me so horny.
i hate it too.
moving along quite well.
have you succeeded in your task?
any day now.
well, let me know when you do. until then.
no, not at all.
well, i was just calling to see how you are doing.
i'm... I am alright.
how was your date?
it was not a date. he is just a friend.
well, i was just calling to tell you i was thinking about you and i miss you. I will let you go.
wait, do not hang up.
okay?
what are you doing?
reading.
what are you reading?
of human bondage.
somerset maugham.
yeah, it is pretty relevant considering my situation.
you are not going to start that again.
sure. have a good night.
i will.
i got your message and came as quick as i could.
i hope i did not keep you from something.
not at all. what is wrong?
it is cecile.
what about her?
well... you promise you will not say anything to her. we have developed a friendship and...
kathryn, you have my word. it is not drugs is it?
it is worse. i think there is something going on between cecile and her music teacher.
ronald? that is crazy.
i know. she is so young and he is so -
black.
i can not thank you enough.
you will be discreet about this?
absolutely.
let me get that for you.
oh please. i can not have you do that.
it is the least i can do.
who the hell do you think you are?!
excuse me.
I am paying you to give cello lessons. not to pervert my child.
mrs. caldwell i think you are misunderstanding something.
is that so?
where did you find those?
margarita found them while cleaning your room.
those are my letters!
do not you raise your voice at me. go to your room, now.
got me off the streets? i live on 59th and park.
whatever. you are never to set foot in this house again and you are never and i mean never to see my daughter again. is that understood?!
first of all, maam, i never touched your daughter and second, i would like to think that in these times someone of your status could look beyond racial lines.
oh do not give me any of that racist crap. my husband and i gave money to colin powell.
i guess that puts me in my place. thank you for the hospitality mrs. caldwell. it was a true awakening.
wow. i never knew she had these kind of feelings.
you are a lucky guy.
she really loves me.
what do you do? tell her you love her.
but i can not even see her. she does not have her own phone, i do not even know her e-mail address.
ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. be romantic. write her another letter.
how will i get to her?
who are you calling?
cecile.
before we go through with this, i just want you to be aware of the damage we are going to cause.
I am aware.
are you really? i mean, we have done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... i mean, we are destroying an innocent girl. you do realize that.
what is that? oh my god, it is your conscience.
you amaze me.
eat me, sebastian. it is alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I am a girl it is wrong. well let me tell you something, i did not ask to be a girl. do you think i relish the fact that i have to act like mary sunshine twenty four seven, so i can be considered a "laaaady." do you think i take great delight when i hear - "kathryn is so wonderful." "kathryn is a model child." "kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I am the marsha fucking brady of the upper east side and sometimes i want to kill myself for it. no, i do not enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. so there is your psychoanalysis doctor freud. now are you in or are you out?
excellent.
you think he will like it?
he will love it.
what are you doing?
just taking your photo.
i look terrible.
mmmm, you are right. those clothes do not do you justice. why do not you take them off.
I am sorry that was out of line.
i want to go home.
i was just kidding.
i want to go home.
okay, okay. I will just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
my mom? do not call my mom.
why not? ... oh wow, she does not know you are here. in fact, you are grounded. jesus, you could get in a shitload of trouble for this. i think i should call her anyway.
please please please. I will do anything. just do not call my mom.
cecile, all i want to do is give you a kiss.
and then i can go home?
of course. I am not a monster.
just a kiss, right?
i swear.
what are you doing?
you promised to let me kiss you.
but -
i do not want to kiss you here. i want to kiss you there.
I am in the bath, mom.
well hurry up. i want to be at mrs. rosemond's before lunch.
okay.
alone again.  what are you up to today?
I am doing some volunteer work.
need any company?
you? volunteer? i do not think so.
i do not know? maybe I would like it. I am trying to change here. you could be supportive.
okay.
babe, you are looking at the next mother teresa.
did i ever tell you the time when my late husband sent me -
yes, you already did.
i did?
right after we played backgammon.
we played backgammon?
uh huh. you beat me three times.
i did?
yep. then i fucked your daughter.
excuse me?
i said, do you want some water?
oh... no thank you...
it is weird. i actually feel good about myself. can we do this again next week?
oh please.
what?
"i actually feel good about myself?"
i do.
you must take me for a real idiot.
i don't.
you are going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
i did. we played three games of backgammon and...
that is okay. it does not make you a bad person.
yes it does.
no, it doesn't. I am happy you are being honest with me.
i can not win with you.
it is not about winning. you know what your problem is? you take yourself way too seriously.
i do not.
lighten up.
i am lighten. can we drop this?
fine.
oh dear, are you actually laughing?
no.
no?
who is it?
it is kathryn.
calm down. tell me what is wrong.
something awful happened last night.
what do you mean?!
i... i do not think you want to know.
cecile, you have to tell me.
it involves your brother. he... took advantage of me.
does your mother know?
if she knew, she would kill me. it happened at your house last night.
why did not you do something?
i do not know.
so, let me get this straight. you came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
well... not exactly.
he made you give him a blow job.
no.
well what then?
if that is what you call it.
cecile, i think you are going to have a hard time crying rape if that is all he did.
what do i do then?
well did you like it?
well... i do not know - it was weird. at first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. then, i started getting really hot and then i started shaking and then like, i do not t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one.
cecile, you had an orgasm.
i did?
I am so proud of you. you are becoming a woman.
i am?
now listen. now that you are on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. think of sebastian as a tutor. let him instruct you.
i do not love him. i love ronald.
so? do not you want to make ronald a happy pappy? practice makes perfect, cecile. my advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
but that would make me a slut.  would not it?
cecile, everybody does it. it is just that nobody talks about it.
it is like a secret society.
that is one way of looking at it.
cool.
i just had a nice chat with cecile. i do not think she will be giving you anymore problems.
yippy.
who are you spying on?
take a look for yourself.
that her?
yeah.
jesus, she reeks of laura ashley.  oh, she is crying. wittle baby's upset by the big bad book.
shut up.
what is your problem?
nothing.
she is really getting to you, is not she?
if you must know, yes. i do not know what to do. i can not stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I am completely infatuated with her.  she made me laugh.
and that is why you are losing your bet?
I am not losing the bet. it is just taking longer than i expected.
do you mind if i take my new porsche for a ride?
kathryn, the only thing you are going to be riding is me. now if you will excuse me, i have some work to do.
am i bothering you?
not at all. have a seat.
my friend monsieur philipe is a friend of florentino.
who is monsieur philipe?
you do not know monsieur philipe?
bonjour monsieur philipe.
you are very pretty. i would like to kiss you.
you know what? i do not take it back.
why are you doing this?
because I am in love with you.
i thought you said we were going to be friends.
i can not handle it. i can not keep my feelings bottled up like you. can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... tell me!
i have feelings for you.
then what is wrong? i love you annette. it is not like you have a husband, unless your married to jesus.
that is not fair.
why can not we be together?
you really want to know?
yes.
it is because i do not trust myself with you.  i took a vow and because of you I am tempted to break it. do not destroy that for me. please.
want to join me?
some other time, cecile.
am i suppose to be this sore?
for the first time, yes. it will pass.
i like it better when I am on top.
cecile. this is what i like to call quiet time. this is time when we reflect on what we have done.
I am sorry.
you think?
is it me?
no, you were fine.
where are you going?
I am taking a shower.
need any company?
no.
want a blow job?
good night cecile.
prude.
i just came to say goodbye.
where are you going?
back to the city. i may take off to europe for the rest of the summer. i just can not handle it around here.
i think that is for the best.
good for you.
sebastian, please. i do not want us to end on bad terms.
well, I am afraid you do not have a choice in the matter. you make me sick. you are a hypocrite and i do not associate with hypocrites.
how am i a hypocrite?
oh please annette. you spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. well here it is. right in front of you, but you are going to turn your back on it. I am sorry that we are not at the age where we can get married. if we were, I would propose, but that is not going to happen. so i guess we are just fucked. I will move on, but you... you are going to have to live with yourself knowing you have turned your back on love. and that makes you a hypocrite.
please do not go.
get off me.
morning!
morning.
so? how did it go last night?
with who?
well i know how it went with cecile. she will not shut up about it. how did it go with mrs. jesus?
if your asking if i nailed her the answer is no.
she shot you down.
exactly the opposite.
so what went wrong?
i do not know. she was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but i-- i don't, i was... i just did not feel right about it.
you are telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. god are you a chump.
a momentary lapse of judgment, soon to be rectified.
if you are heading towards her room, you will not find her.
where is she?
you do not know?  she left thirty minutes ago.
where did she go?
she would not say. she apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends.  you blew it, sebastian. that girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again.
is she with you?
who is this?
sebastian, you faggot. is she with you?
no.
where is she?!
i do not know. why do not you leave her alone.
mcconnell, I am going to out your ass in two seconds if you do not tell me where she is.
i told you i do not know.
one.
alright. she is staying with some friends of her parents. the o'sheas. she caught the train twenty minutes ago into grand central.
grand central. you better not be fucking with me cause it is your ass on the line.
hi.
hi.
I am fine. i have to get going to my friends' house.  was it --
it was perfect.
bad time?
kind of.
well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you would not have invited me in.
you didn't?
oh yes.
tell me all the details.
it was... fantastic.
oh come on. for her first time?
i know. that is the amazing part of it. i mean, it was not like cirque du soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I am going to sound like a hallmark card.
no, tell me.
it was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
wow. so you made love. ooo, i hear the birds chirping.
mock, mock, mock.
some other time.
excuse me?
I am not in the mood.
and that is why you are leaving?
it clearly is why.
i want to fuck.
and i don't.
oh my god. you are completely p-whipped.
no, I am not.
p-whipped, p-whipped.
what is wrong with you? why are you acting this way?
I am sorry. it is just upsetting. you are in love with her. you do not love me anymore.
oh come on, kathryn, it was just a contest.
at first it was, but now it is become something bigger.
kathryn, you know i love you. I have always loved you.
not anymore you don't. it is obvious.
i can not believe you are reacting this way. you are just saying this because you lost the bet.
is that what you think?
that is not fair. you are taking all the fun out of it.
then do me a favor and get rid of her. if not for me, then do it for you. look at yourself. you are a joke. she is turned you into jelly. what do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. people used to respect you. they feared you and now you are going to throw that all away.
why so nervous?
I have never done this before.
how have you dumped girls in the past?
screening calls. any suggestions?
i knew this guy last summer in the hamptons. he and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. but she had this huge weight problem. his friends taunted him mercilessly about it. you know, "how do you breathe when she sits on your face?" "it's embarrassing for you to be seen with her." finally he could not take it anymore and decided to dump her. she flipped and he went on the defensive. i distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. "i'm completely fucked up." "i'm completely fucked up." "i'm completely fucked up."  poor fatty never had a chance.
hi. is annette at home?
you must be sebastian. I have heard such nice things about you.
hi.
hi.
would you like a tour?
sure.
this is not working out for me anymore.
yeah, me neither.
it is not you, it is me. I am completely fucked up.
what are you saying?
why are not you understanding?
i love you.
i know. i wish i felt the same. unfortunately, i feel nothing. i think it was just the conquest. sorry, I am completely fucked up.
why are you trying to hurt me?
I am just being honest. i just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
you do not know how to love.
you do not even know me. the fact of the matter is there is some one i love. she is smarter, prettier... you do not even compare to her. the only reason i am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
but you knew this was important to me.
what, your virginity? well that is over now.
a little melodramatic, do not you think.
i have a flair for drama.
mind if i ask what you are doing in my room?
you wanted an answer to your question.
annette?
devastated beyond repair. i doubt she will ever trust a man again.
well done.
i thought we should celebrate.
I would love to, but unfortunately I am expecting some company.
ronald?
not that it is any of your business but yes.
well done.
thank you. now, where were we?
to my triumph, of course.
not my choice of toast, but it is your call. to your triumph over annette.
silly rabbit. my triumph is not over her. it is over you.
come again?
you were very much in love with her and you are still in love with her. but it amused me to make you ashamed of it. you gave up on the first person you ever loved because i called you names. do not get me wrong, I am flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, i never loved you, sebastian. you are just a toy. a little toy i play with. and now you have completely blown it with her. i think that is the saddest thing I have ever heard.  cheers.
in any event, you still owe me my reward.
I am sorry, but unfortunately i do not fuck losers.
get off me!
will you calm down?
fine! get off me!
I am very sorry about that. i apologize.
i accept. now get out.
get out? we had an arrangement.
did not you hear what i said?
i do not care what you said, we had an agreement. you have slept with half of the borough so do not tell me you are being choosy.
get out!
I am giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
and if i don't?
then i will consider it a declaration of war. one. two... three.
i think you have your answer.
war it is.
it is desperate that i talk to her.
I have already told you, she is not home.
well please leave a message that i called.
I will do that.
what do you want?
i need to talk to annette.
she is not here.
do you know where she is?
she is out.
do you know when she will be back?
later. listen, we are entertaining some guests so -
annette! annette!
young man, i already told you she is not here.
fine. could you please see that she gets this.
I will do that.
it is really important.
i understand. good night.
hello.
ronald?
yeah?
it is kathryn.
hi kathryn. is everything okay?
no.
what is wrong?
it is sebastian. he is out of his mind.
what do you mean?
i think he is high on drugs. he hit me, then took off. I am afraid to be alone. please come over.
I will be right there.
and when i confronted him about his affair with cecile he told me it was none of my business. then when i said "well what about ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
and this happened before you and i hooked up?
it is been going on for a while.  then he called me a disgrace to our family and that is when he hit me.
racist piece of shit.
I would be careful if i were you. god knows what he is up to.
he does not scare me. I will kick his ass in.
will you stay here for the night? you can leave in the morning. that is when my parents get back and --
do not worry about it. I will stay.
what time is it?
eight o'clock. you got to go.
did she show up?
nope.
do you mind if i check upstairs?
i can not have you do that, nor can i have you hanging around the lobby all day.
i understand. thanks for letting me crash here.
do not worry about it.
hey ronald.
it seems that you and i have some talking to do.
can we do it later. I have had a really bad night and -
where the hell do you come off hitting women?
what are you talking about?
kathryn. did you hit her?
kathryn? oh christ, she got to you too?
did you hit her?
ronald, you do not know what you are talking about.
do not know what I am talking about? i know that you fucked cecile.
ronald, I am sorry.
you bastard!
I am kathryn.
annette harrison.
have we met?
i do not think so.
did you know sebastian well?
you might say that.
now i remember. annette harrison. your father's the new headmaster at oakwood.
that is right.
I am sure you are going to love it there.
are you okay?
I will be fine.
well, I will leave you alone now. i just came in here to get something of mine.
thank you.
look, i know this sounds corny, but whenever i feel like i can not go on i...  turn to jesus and he helps me through the problem. call me an anachronism, but -
oh cut the shit, kathryn.
excuse me?
you heard me.
who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. my brother is dead, have some respect.
kathryn, i know all about you and sebastian.
sebastian was a pathological liar. i would not believe a word he -
i have his journal.
you what?
his journal. he sent it to me the day before he died. everything about you is in it. the blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. let's see, then there is your coke problem... you still keep it in your crucifix, do not you? it is all in there.
you did not show it to anybody?
actually, i was planning on running down to kinkos. do you think you could give me ride?
you can not do this to me. it could ruin me.
i know.
