excuse me, do you know if we have passed nostrand avenue yet?  excuse me.  look, I am asking a simple question. have we hit nostrand avenue? i fell asleep.
i no from around here.
yeah, you and everyone else.
jake, is that you?
what the hell did you do, move all the furniture?
why did not you turn on the light?
i did not want to wake you.
gee, thanks a lot.
where is the lamp?
where are you?
if i knew i would not have to ask. what did you do? i was happy the way it was.
i moved the couch. that is all.
where to?
that help?
thanks.
what do you think?
what do you mean?
the room!
oh god, jezzie, ask me tomorrow.
it is tomorrow. four a.m. how come you are so late?
roberts did not show up. what could i say? besides, it is double time.
what happened to you?
do not ask.
you up?
no. have you seen my glasses?
where did you leave 'em?
i do not know.
did you look around the headboard?
jezzie, i can not see.
maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
thanks.  what is that?
your kid dropped it off.
who? jed?
no. the little one.
eli. why can not you remember their names?
they are weird names.
they are biblical. they were prophets.
well, personally, i never went for church names.
and where do you think jezebel comes from?
i do not let anybody call me that.
you are a real heathen, you know that, jezzie? jesus, how did i ever get involved with such a ninny?
you sold your soul, remember? that is what you told me.
yeah, but for what?
a good lay.
and look what i got.
the best.
i must have been out of my head.
jake, you are never out of your head!
what is in here?
pictures. your wife was going to toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
look at these, will ya? i do not believe it. jesus, these are fantastic. look, here's my dad ... and here's my brother, when we were down in florida.
lemme see.
here. look. this is me and sarah when i was still at city college.
that is sarah?  i can see what you mean.
what?
why you left.
what do you mean you can see?
look at her face. a real bitch.
she looked good then.
not to me.
well, you did not marry her.
is that the one who died?
gabe.
wait. don't.
i do not like things that make you cry.
i just want to look ...
ready?
just gettin' rid of the garbage.
how 'bout over there?  no wait. do me a favor. bring 'em to the back room.
they are awfully heavy.
i know. that is why I am asking.
where is wong?
that is what I would like to know. if you see him on the street somewhere, tell him he is fired.
how was palm springs?
hot. where do i sign?
you got a nice tan, though.
tan? what tan? it faded on the airplane. I would try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  two hundred dollars a night, for what?
no. I will take the other one.  right. well it is good to have you back. see you tomorrow, probably.
if you are lucky.
jake!
how is it going?
I am going home.
what is wrong?
i do not know. one of these days, I am going to see louis. my back's killing me.
now? what about the boss? he is not going to like it.
well, I will miss riding home with you. i was looking forward to it.
I will be glad to avoid the crush.
i enjoy crushing into you.
come on, jake. that did not hurt.
how do you know?
i know you. how come you are so tense today?
what can i tell you?
i saw sarah the other day.
her knee acting up?
a bit.
what did she have to say?
turn on your right side.  how about the other "right?"  i do not understand you philosphers. you have got the whole world figured out but you can not remember the difference between right and left.
i was absent the day they taught that in school. what did she say?
who?
sarah.
not much. she is like you that way. two clams. no wonder your marriage did not last. put your hand under your head. take a breath and then let it out.
ah, good. now turn to your left.
she talk about the boys?
she says she can not get them new coats because you have not sent the alimony for three months.
she told you that?  did she tell you about the $2,000 I am still paying for the orthodontist? I will bet she did not mention that.
she said you were a son of a bitch and she regrets the day she set eyes on you.
i thought you said she did not say much.
she didn't. that is about all she said. put your hand up. good. i think she still loves you. take a breath and let it out.
loves me!? she has not said a kind word about me in years!
right. she does not stop talking about you. you are always on her mind. that is love, jake.
she hates me, louis.
you should go back to her.
what? she threw me out, remember. she wanted some professor to carry her far away from brooklyn. only we did not make it. she can not forgive me that she still lives in the same house she grew up in.
her problem is that you spent eight years getting a phd and then went to work for the post office.
what can i tell you, louis? after nam i did not want to think anymore. i decided my brain was too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
if it was any other brain but yours, i might agree. relax, this is going to be strong.
i can not relax.
wiggle your toes.
god almighty. what did you do to me?
i had to get in there. a deep adjustment. rest a moment and let it set a bit.
i had this weird flash just then.
what?
i do not know. I have been having them recently.  you know, you look like an angel, louis, an overgrown cherub. anyone ever tell you that?
yeah. you. every time i see you. no more errol flynn, okay? your back will not take it. you tell your girl friend to calm down if she knows what is good for you.
louis, you are a life saver.
i know.
maybe it is all the pressure, jake. the money. things like that. or your wife.
why do you bring her up?
'cause she is always on your mind.
when was the last time i said a word?
it has nothin' to do with talkin'.
it is still there, jake.  even if you never say a word about it. you can not spend two years in vietnam ...
what does that have to do with anything? does it explain the barricaded subway stations? does it explain those godforsaken creatures?
new york is filled with creatures. everywhere. and lots of stations are closed.
they are like demons, jez.
demons, jake? come on. they are winos and bag ladies. low life. that is all they are. the streets are crawling with 'em. do not make em into somethin' they are not.  it is the pressure, honey. that is all it is.
those guys tried to kill me tonight. they were aiming right at me.
kids on a joy ride. happens all the time.
they were not human!
come on. what were they, jake?
I would like to speak to dr. carlson, please.
carlson? is he new here?
new? he is been here for years.
not according to my charts. do you have an appointment?
look, i need to see him. i know where his room is. just give me a pass. i will not be long. ten minutes.
our doctors are seen by appointment only.
damn it. i was in the veteran's out- patient program. he knows me.
what is your name?
jacob singer.
I am sorry but there is no record of a jacob singer in our files.
whataya mean, no record?
you want me to spell it out? there is nothing here.
that is ridiculous. I have been coming here for years. listen to me. I am going out of my fucking mind here. i need to see him.
if this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. there is about an hour's wait. I will be glad to take your name. why do not you just fill out this form?
goddamn it! i do not want a social worker. carlson knows me.
can i help you?
I am looking for dr. carlson. is not this his office?
I am so sorry. obviously you have not ... dr. carlson died.
died?
a car accident.
jesus, jesus! ... when?
last month, before thanksgiving.
how did it happen?
no one knows. they say it blew up.
blew up? what do you mean it blew up?
do you want me to get someone?
no. no. it is okay. I am okay.
go on jake. she reads 'em like a book.
no, thanks.
it is fun.
you have an unusual hand.
i could have told you that.
you see this line here? it is your life line. here's where you were born. and this is where you got married. you are a married man, huh? oh oh. nope. divorce. see this split.
you know, you got a strange line here.
it is short, huh?
short? it is ended.
oh, terrific.
it is not funny. according to this ... you are already dead.
just my luck.
he is burning up.
total delirium.
that is some gash. his guts keep spilling out.
push 'em back.
help me!
you okay?
i wanna leave. get me out of here.
oh, come on. it is early.
where are we?
we are at della's.
where?
what do you mean? where do you think?
where is della? bring her here?
why? what for?
show me della!
hey, I am here.
hiya jake. that was some dance.
della?
you want to see me? well, here i am.
i see.
what do you want?
just to see you. that is all.
well, how do i look?
like della.
can not you stop it?
if i could stop it, I would stop it.
what is it say? a hundred and two?
i do not believe this. I am calling the doctor.
what does it say?
it is gone to the top.
how high is that?
the numbers stop at 107.
what the hell are you doin'?
get your clothes off.
what are you talking about? I am freezing.
get your clothes off!
what did the doctor say?
that you would die on the way to the hospital. now get into that tub.
he is coming right over.
coming here?
goddamn it. get in here. i can not stand around waiting.
you are out of your mind. I am not getting in there. I would rather die.
that is your decision.
look at me. I am ice cold.
you are red hot, damn it. get in there. I have got to get more ice.
i can not do it.
what kind of man are you?
do not gimme that.
lie down!
jezzie! my feet are throbbing!
sam, tony, come in here.
hey, I am not dressed.
help me! help me!
here. I will do it.
i have some ice from the machine.
bring it in.
is he all right?
he does not like it.
i do not blame him. what should i do with the ice?
pour it in.
on top of him?
he is melting it as fast as we dump it in.
okay. my husband's got two more bags. he is coming. they are heavy.
what was that?
it is freezing.
I am not cold.
of course not. you have all the blankets. it must be ten degrees in here. I am telling you, sarah, if you want to sleep with fresh air, you sleep on the fire escape. from now on that window is closed.
it is not healthy with it closed.
this is healthy? I will probably die of pneumonia tomorrow and this is healthy.
what a dream i was having. i was living with another woman ... you know who it was?
i do not want to know.
jezebel, from the post office. you remember, you met her that time at the christmas party. i was living with her. god, it was a nightmare. there were all these demons and i was on fire. only i was burning from ice.
guilty thoughts. see what happens when you cheat on me, even in your mind?
she was good in bed, though.
go to sleep.
she had these real beefy thighs. delicious.
i thought you said it was a nightmare?
daddy, what was that noise?
gabe?  what are you doing ... ?
there was a bang.
it was the window.
it is cold.
tell your mother.
mom, it is ...
wait ... daddy.
now what?
do not go.
do not go?  I am not going anywhere. I am right here, gabe.  come on, go back to sleep. you can still get a couple of hours.
jake.  you are going to be all right, jake. you are going to be fine.
am i home?
you are here. home. the doctor said you are lucky your brains did not boil.  what a night, jake. it was crazy. you kept sayin' "sarah, close the window," over and over. and talkin' to your kids. even the dead one. weird. you know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. amazing, huh?
are we in brooklyn?
you are right here, jake. you just rest.  the doctor said you had a virus. that is what they say when they do not know what it is. you can not do anything for a week. he says you got to recuperate.  now you just lie here. mrs. sandelman made you some chicken soup. it will warm you up.
you know, you really ought to get out today. you can not just sit around like this all the time. it is not healthy. it is not good for your mind. go take a walk, or somethin'. go to a movie. christ, who is going to know? you think i care? i do not give a shit. go. enjoy yourself. one of us should be having a good time.  hello! anybody home?  anybody in there?
what?
look, I am horny. keep it in mind.  love me a little?
you are the most unbelievable woman i have ever met. one second you are a screaming banshee and the next you are florence nightingale. who are you? that is what i want to know. will the real jezzie pipkin please stand up.
hello.
jacob singer?
speaking.
paul gruneger!
paul gruneger! well I will be goddamned!
paul! you son-of-a-bitch, how the hell are you? i have not seen you in what, five, six, years?
a long time.
jesus christ. how've you been? what is happening in your life?
nothin' much.
me neither. nothing too exciting. so tell me, to what do i owe the honor?
i need to see you, jake.
shit, paul. I would love to see you. but I am kind of laid up here. I have been sick.
i need to see you.
jesus, man, you look terrific. you must have put on twenty pounds.
i work in a bakery.
you are lucky. how many vets you know are even employed?
count 'em on one hand.
it is almost like a conspiracy, huh?
no joke. fuckin' army! that goddamn war. I am still fightin' it.
it is not worth it. you will never win.
you tellin' me? how many times can you die, huh?
still married, jake?
nope.
you and everybody else. god i hate this area. makes me nervous.
why the hell we drivin' here?
i just need to talk.
you can not talk in brownsville?
I am not sure where i can talk anymore.
what is wrong?
let's get a couple drinks, okay?  hey, take a look behind us. do you think that car is followin' us?
that black car?
pull the mirror down on the sun visor.  just watch 'em.
what is goin' on paul?
i do not know.
you in trouble?
yeah.
that is as straight as i can put it. and do not tell me that I am crazy 'cause i know I am not. I am goin' to hell. they are comin' after me.
who is?
they have been followin' me. they are comin' outta the walls. i do not trust anyone. I am not even sure i trust you. but i got to talk to someone. I am going to fly outta my fuckin' mind.
sorry. sometimes i think I am just going to jump outta my skin. they are just drivin' me wild.
who, paul? what exactly ... ?
i do not know who they are, or what they are. but they are going to get me and I am scared, jake. I am so scared i can not do anything. i can not go to my sisters. i can not even go home.
why not?
they are waitin' for me, that is why.
it is okay, paul. it is okay.
i do not know what to do.
do not do anything.  paul, i know what you are talking about.
what do you mean?
I have seen them too ... the demons!
you have seen them?
everywhere, like a plague.
god almighty. i thought i was the only one.
me, too. i had no idea. it is like i was coming apart at the seams.
oh god. i know. i know.
what is it paul? what is happening to me?
they keep telling me I am already dead, that they are going to tear me apart, piece by piece, and throw me into the fire.  i carry these everywhere but they do not help. nothing helps. everyone thinks I am crazy. my mother filed a report with the army.
the army?
she said i have not been the same since then. since that night. there is still this big hole in my brain. it is so dark in there, jake. and these creatures. it is like they are crawling out of my brain. what happened that night? why will not they tell us?
i do not know. i do not know.
they are monsters, jake. we are both seein' 'em. there is got to be a connection. something.
I am afraid to go by myself anymore. i keep thinkin' one of 'em's going to come up behind me. somethin's wrong when a guy can not even take a leak by himself. I have seen 'em take people right off the street. i used to go home a different way every night. now i can not even go home.
you come home with me.
what about your girlfriend? you do not think she will mind?
are you kidding? we have put up more of her cousins. you would not believe how they breed down there.
bullshit. someone is covering somethin'. that was no accident.
why do you say that?
cars do not explode that way. any simpleton knows that.
but the paper ...
that was set. I am tellin' you.
by who? why? paul did not have an enemy in the world.
how do you know?
hey, you are talkin' about paul. who would want to hurt him?
what did he talk about when you guys went out? did he say anything?
he was upset. he thought people were following him.
what do you mean, demons?
he told me he was going to hell.
what did he say that for? what made him say that? strange, huh? strange.
what else did he say, jake?
he was scared. he saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. they were tryin' to get him, he said.
how long had that been going on?
a couple of weeks, i think.
he say what they looked like?
no. not really ...
excuse me a minute. I will be right back.
something weird is going on here. what is it about us? even in nam it was always weird. are we all crazy or something?
yeah, ever since that ...
grass never did that to me.
you know, I have been to three shrinks and a hypnotist. nothing penetrates that night. nothing.
it is not worth goin' over again and again. whatever happened, happened. it is over.
... I have seen them, too.
shit!
dr. carlson's dead?
an explosion, just like paul's.
you think they are connected?
i think something is fucking connect- ed. i mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. doug too, right? we have got six guys here going fucking crazy.
not me, buddy.
okay, not you rod. but the rest of us are flipping out for some goddamn reason. they are tryin' to kill us. fuck it man, we need to find out what is going on.
come on, professor. the army's not going to give you any answers. you will be buttin' your head against a stone wall.
maybe that is the only way to get through. besides, six heads'll be better than one.
not my head, buddy. not me. I am gettin' a headache just listenin' to you.
we should get ourselves a lawyer.
i say you should get a shrink.
too late. I have tried. i think you are right, jake. I am game.
me, too.
I am sorry, mr. singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? it would break your heart.
this is not injustice, mr. geary. the army did something to us and we have got to find out what.
the army. the army. what is it with you guys? we are not talking about a trip to the library here. this is the united states government for god's sake. this is red tape coming out of your ass. you know what i mean?
exactly. and we need someone to cut through it. we hear you are the man.
oh yeah? what am i - perry mason here?
doctor.  ph.d.
ah! i thought you were a mailman.
i am.
then why are not you teaching? why are not you in a university?
I am too messed up to teach.
ah! well then, they are going to have to pay for that, are not they?
so tell me ... am i still an angel?
with wings. you transport me, you know that? you carry me away.
we are all angels, you know ...  ... and devils. it is just what you choose to see.
i love you, jez.
i know.
underneath all the bullshit, just love.
remember that.
you know what? i feel ... exorcised ... like the demons are gone.
how come? the army?
in a way. at least now i have some idea of what was happening. if we can only get them to admit ... to explain what they did ... i do not know. maybe it would clear things up in my head. I will tell you something, jez, honestly ... i thought they were real.
i put a frozen dinner in the oven, a manhandler. it will be ready at a quarter of. i threw a little salad together. it is in the fridge. i also bought some apple juice, red cheek. do not drink it all. oh, and jake, your lawyer called.
he did? when?
while you were in the shower.
why did not you call me?
he did not give me a chance.  look, honey, do not get upset, but he is not taking your case.
what? what do you mean?
he said you did not have one.
what is he talking about?
i do not know. that is all he said. he was not very friendly. oh, yeah. he said your buddies backed down. they chickened out, he said.
i do not believe this.
baby, I am sorry. i feel terrible. I would stay and talk but I am so late. look, do not be upset. we will talk when i get home. see you around midnight.  bye. and do not brood. watch t.v. or something.
hello.
frank. it is jake. jacob singer.
listen, i just got a strange call from geary. he said the guys backed down. what is he talking about?
that is right. we did.
what does that mean, frank? i do not get it. why?
it is hard to explain.
well, try, huh.
i do not know if i can. it is just that war is war. things happen.
things happen? what the fuck are you talking about? they did something to us, frank. we have to expose this.
there is nothing to expose.
jesus christ! who is been talking to you?  what is going on? how can you just turn away?  what about the others?
they are not interested, jake.
shit! you know it is not half the case if i go it alone. we are all suffering the same symptoms, frank. the army is to blame. they have done something to us. how can you not want to know?
maybe it is not the army, jake.
what do you mean?
maybe there is a larger truth.
what are you talking about?
maybe the demons are real.
goddamn it. what kind of bullshit is that?
listen, jake. i gotta go.
what the hell? what kind of mumbo jumbo ... ?
I am hanging up.
hey, wait!
do not bother to call again, okay?
who is been talking to you? the army? have they been talking to you, huh?
nobody's been talking to nobody. you do not have a case, you hear me? it is pure and simple. now leave me alone. okay?
listen, will you listen? they are trying to get me. they are comin' out of the walls. the army's done something to me. i need you.
you need ... a doctor.
a doctor? and what is he going to do, tell me I am crazy? they have fucked with my head. I have got to prove it. you have got to do something.
you mind? I am eating, huh?
something is going on here. you are not telling me something. what the hell's gotten into you?
I will tell you what is gotten into me. i do not know you from adam, right? you come to my office with this bizarro story and demand i look into it. okay. i said I would check it out and i did. now i do not know what kind of fool you take me for, but you have used and abused me, and i do not like it.
used you?
i talked to the army's bureau of records. you have never even been to viet nam.
what the hell is that supposed to mean?
it means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in thailand.
war games? thailand? that is not true! how can you believe that? can not you see what they are doing? it is all a lie. we were in da nang, for god's sake. you have got to believe me.
i do not have to do any such thing. I am eating my lunch, okay?
my back. i can not move. i need my chiropractor.
your back? did you fall?
they stole it.
who did?
i do not know. santa claus. i had my son's picture in it. gabe's picture. it is the only one i had.
we better get an orthopedic man in here. is dr. davis on call?
I will page him.
call my chiropractor.
we are doing everything we can.
louis schwartz. nostrand avenue.
I am going to have to move you a bit, just to check for injuries. this may hurt a little.
no. do not move me.
i do not have to ask if you can feel that.
goddamn it. i want louis.
get me out of here.
where do you want to go?
take me home.
home?  this is your home. you are dead.
dead? no. i just hurt my back. I am not dead.
what are you then?
I am alive.
then what are you doing here?
i do not know. i do not know.  this is not happening.
what is not happening?
let me out of here!
there is no out of here. you have been killed. do not you remember?
remember?
no! that was years ago! I have lived years since then.
it is all been a dream.
no! the army did this to me! they have done something to my brain.  jezzie! i want my boys! sarah! I am not dead! i want my family!
I am not dead. i am not dead.
no. of course you are not. you have just hurt your back. that is all. you are going to be fine. it will just take some time.
dream on!
no! oh god.
jacob, what can i do?
save me!
well, do not we look better this morning? that was a hard night, was not it?
where am i?
lennox hospital.
I am awake?
you look awake to me. here.  drink some of this.
where is sarah? where did she go?  she was here ...
no. no. you have not had any visitors.
that is a lie. my family was here.
I am sorry.
last night! they were as real as you are!
this is not a dream! this is my life.
of course it is. what else could it be?
half an hour from now and you will be walking out of here all by yourself. mark my words.  well, you have done it to yourself this time, have not you?
am i dead, louis?  am i dead?
from a slipped disc? that would be a first.
i was in hell. I have been there. it is horrible. i do not want to die, louis.
well, I will see what i can do about it.
I have seen it. it is all pain.
you ever read meister eckart?  how did you ever get your doctorate without reading eckart?  good. okay, let's turn over gently. right side.
perfect. we got it.  okay. let's just give it a little try. see if you can stand.
what? by myself?
you can do it. come on. easy. just give it a try.
what are you doing?
there is something I have got to take care of, louis.
what are you talking about? you can barely stand.
I am walking, are not i?
jake, you need to rest.
not tonight, louis. no more rest.
throw that torch away, young man. give yourself up. you are under arrest.
for what? for seeking the truth?
please come quietly.
you come near me and I will blow us all up.
we are not going to hurt you.
clear the area. this is an order!
what is wrong with you?
it is just me.
jezzie?
who else were you expecting?
let go!
where were you, jake? where have you been? why have not you called?
stay away from me, jez.
i want to know. you tell me!
you wanna know? turn on the t.v. watch the fucking news!
why are you doing this to me? you can not just go away like that.
i can do anything i want.
don't!
it might be for me.
I am not here. you have not seen me.
hello ... no. he is not here. i have not seen him all night ... i do not know when ... what? tell him what?  vietnam? ... what experiments?
who was that?
a chemist. part of a chemical warfare unit out of saigon. he said he knows me and that I will know him when i see him.
how?
i have no idea.  i was right. there were experiments. i knew it. i knew it. my god.
how do you know he is telling the truth?
surprised, huh? i told you you would know me. I have been tracking you for a long time. i just wish I would spoken to you before tonight.
i do not get it. who are you? why have you been following me?
observation, mainly. clinical study. you were one of the survivors.
so first I am arrested, right? best lsd i ever made, right down the drain. i figure this is it, twenty years in the joint, if I am lucky. that was '68.
long time ago.
next thing i know I am on rikers island. ever been there?  suddenly they take me from my cell to the visitors room with those bank teller windows, you know. four army colonels, medals up their asses, are standing on the other side. they tell me if I will come to vietnam for two years, no action, mind you, just work in a lab, they will drop all the charges and wipe the record clean. well, I would only been in jail for thirteen hours and i already knew that nam could not be any worse.
shows how much you knew.
no shit. they had me by the balls. next thing i know I am in saigon ... in a secret lab synthesizing mind- altering drugs. not the street stuff mind you. they had us isolating special properties. the dark side, you know? they wanted a drug that increased aggressive tendencies.
yeah, sure. we were losing the war.
right. they were worried. they figured you guys were too soft. they wanted something to stir you up, tap into your anger, you know? and we did it. the most powerful thing i ever saw. even a bad trip, and i had my share, never compared to the fury of the ladder.
the ladder?
that is what they called it. a fast trip right down the ladder.  right to the primal fear, the base anger. I am tellin' you, it was powerful stuff. but i do not need to tell you. you know.
anyway, this big offensive was coming up. everyone knew it; time magazine, huntley-brinkley. and the brass was scared 'cause they knew we could not win. morale was down. it was gettin' ugly in the states. hell, you remember.
like it was yesterday.
a couple days later they decided to use the ladder, on one test battalion. yours. just in an infintessimal dose in the food supply, to prove its effectiveness in the field. they were sure your unit would have the highest kill ratio in the whole goddamn offensive. and you did, too. but not the way they tnought.
none of us can remember that night. i get flashes of it but they do not make sense. we saw shrinks for years. but nothing they did could ever touch it. what happened? was there ever an offensive?
a couple of days later. it was fierce. you guys never saw it.
but there was an attack. i can still see them coming. there was a fight, was not there?
yeah. but not with the cong.
who then?
i always suspected the effects might come back. that is why i had to follow you. i had a hell of a time getting hold of your records.
if you knew, why did not you say anything?
the truth can kill, my friend. five hundred men died out there. this is not a story they would ever want out. when paul's car blew up i realized the scope of the thing. i knew they meant business.
so why tell me now?
because i can get rid of the demons. i can block the ladder. i have an antidote. we can kill them off, chemically speaking. they will all disappear. it is chemistry, my friend. i know. i created it. come with me. i can help.
you come here often?
sometimes. when it is convenient.
how do i know this is not just some kind of, you know, seduction or something?
hey, I am not the problem. you have got bigger problems than me.
i came up with the formula back in nam but i never got a chance to use it.
never?
I would hoped I would never have to. just open your mouth and stick out your tongue.
what is it?
do not worry. take it. it will free your head. come on.
i do not know.
"yea though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i shall fear no evil," but no one ever said i would not be shittin' in my pants every step of the way, huh?  stick out your tongue.  that'a boy. now why do not you just lie down and relax.
one drop?
it is strong stuff.
i think I am falling asleep.
pleasant dreams.
i can not move.
just relax.
what is happening? help me.
and no more demons. i told you they would be gone.
i do not believe this. it is a miracle, michael. a miracle.
better living through chemistry, that is my motto.
it was paradise, michael. you showed it to me. you were there.
well that is good to know.
mike, it was real. it was glorious.
glorious. I am not surprised. i fed you enough of that stuff to send a horse to heaven. I am just glad you came back.
i would have stayed there if i could.
I am sure. you have got nothing but troubles waitin' for you here.
here. I have got every credit card ever printed. take this. stay here till you can arrange to get away. it is on me.
no. i couldn't.
what? you want the plaza? do not be foolish. here. take this, too.  this is my place on prince street. it is got my phone, everything. call if you need me ... but you won't. everything's going to work out. you just get outta town as fast as you can. the new york police can be effective when they want to be.
i do not know what to say.
save the words ... just send back my credit card.
what are you doing here? are you all right? how do you expect to pay for this?  everyone's looking for you, jake. i dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. i do not know what you are going to do.
I am going to make love to you. that is what I am going to do.
are you out of your mind?
yep. finally. i love you, jez.
god, i can not keep up with all your changes.
me neither.
what is gotten into you?
it is amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. it is hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
i tell you, it was so wonderful. i felt like a little boy. i saw paradise, jezzie.
it is so hard to believe.
this is one of my dreams, jake. ever since i was a little girl. i never thought it would happen.
stick with me, kid.
i want to go with you, jake. wherever you go.
it is not practical, jez. it will be hard enough alone.
i can waitress. I am good.
no. things are too hot. later. I will send for you.
bullshit!
i promise.
please.
no. I am a marked man, jez. I am the only one left. i do not want to expose you to that. it is not right for you or me. be reasonable.
reasonable? reasonable? jake ... you are gettin' me angry.
i love you when you are angry.
oh yeah?  try leavin' without me.
dream on!
what?!
dr. singer. it is been a long time.
hello, sam.
are you all right?
I am okay.
do you want some help? i can call upstairs.
no, don't. but thanks.
what are you ... ? where is sarah? where are the boys?
sit down, jake.
where are they?
sit down.
no! what is going on? where is my family?
it is over, jake. it is all over.
where have they gone?
wake up. stop playing with yourself. it is finished.
what is going on?
your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, dr. singer.
what is wrong, jake?  forget to take your antidote?
who are you? what are you doing to me?
you have quite a mind, jake. i loved your friends. that chemist - the ladder. what an imagination you have!
who are you?
how many times have you asked me that? how many times?
tell me, damn you!
you know who i am.
are you in the service?
the postal service. I am a mailman.
ah. neither snow nor sleet, nor dark of night ... i always admired that.
it is good to see you.
likewise.
and how is your wife? sarah, no?
i have not seen her in months.
ah!
I am with another woman now. we are both with the post office, midtown, 34th street branch.
hmm. i do not suppose there are too many philosophers in the post office?
oh, you would be surprised. they just do not have their doctorates, that is all.
last i heard you were offered a posi- tion in the west somewhere. tuscon was it?
oh, that goes way back. they had a hiring freeze, one of those last min- ute things. bad timing for me though. middle of the war. the draft.  I will tell you prof, after viet nam ... i did not want to think anymore. i decided my brain was just too small an organ to comprehend this chaos.
jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, i might agree.  tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she is living with?
i doubt it is my mind that interests her. i tell you prof, she is a fiery lady.
well, try not to get burned. you have a great mind, jacob. do not let anyone tempt you away from it.
I have got a problem, prof. more augus- tine than kierkegaard, if you know what i mean.  i need to know about ... demons.
demons, jacob? why demons? are you writing ... ?
no.  i see them.
see them?  what do you mean? physically?
yes.
i know very little about demons, ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. i know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... dante, milton ... but jacob,  this is the 20th century. we do not see demons now.
i see them, prof. everywhere. they are invading my life.
christ, i know how it sounds.
have you considered a doctor? a psy- chiatrist?
yes.  i do not want them. I am not looking for analysis or drugs. it is too easy to dismiss as some kind of psychosis.  it is more than that. i can feel it. i need you prof. you are the only one i can talk to.
i do not know what to say.
i need your insight, your intuition.
demons? i do not know what to tell you. it sounds like a spiritual mat- ter to me. the problem, jacob, is that you have no context for it. you are a renegade existentialist suf- fering demons a hundred years after freud. how the hell am i supposed to make it fit?
I am afraid, prof. nothing makes sense.  please help me.
jacob, i do not believe in demons, not in the empirical sense. i do not be- lieve in devils fighting for our souls. i do not believe in enternal damnation. i do not believe in other- worldly creatures tormenting us. we do not need them. we do a good enough job on ourselves.
but i see them.
look. i do not pretend to know what is going on inside your head. for all i know it is pathological and they should be pumping valium into your veins by the quart. but if you are not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, i admire you for that: then you will have to do bat- tle on your own. what can i say? it is a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. but to be pursued by ... demons no less ... there are no guides, jacob.  you wanna know what I would do if i sud- denly started seeing demons? I would hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I am no saint.
hell, you think i am?
i'venever understood you, you know that? you were by far the best pupil I have ever had, bar none. intellectu- ally, you were the most original, the most imaginative. who knows, maybe you have been "elected" to see demons. maybe you are in touch with ... some- thing. nothing would surprise me about you jacob. nothing.
he is burning up.
total delirium.
he will never make it.
that is some gash. his guts keep spilling out.
push 'em back.
help me!
so tell me ... am i still an angel?
with wings.  you transport me, you know that? you carry me away.
it is going to be all right, jake. it is going to be all right. do not be afraid. I have got you now.
hold me, jezzie. hold me.
why will not you answer me?
cause you know goddamn well who i am.
i do not know you.
you have lived with me for two years.
that does not mean shit. where do you come from, huh? and i do not mean indiana.
what do you want me to say? my mother's tummy?
you know goddamn well what i mean.
you are out of your fucking mind. I am not going to stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
well leave then. go to hell.
you son-of-a-bitch. who do you think you are? i do not deserve this. who takes care of you day and night? who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? well, I have had it. you flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I am done holding your hand. i do not want anything to do with you, you hear? nothing!
what did you do that for? it is an in- teresting story. all these people are still disappearing. right off the street.  hey, what is wrong? are you all right?
I am okay. i just do not want to lis- ten.
you look upset.
I am not upset.
jake, what is it?
I am tired.
you look terrible. what happened?  jake ... is it the antidote?
goddamn it. why do you say that?
look at yourself. you look like you have seen a ghost.
shit! can not i just have a bad day?
you can have anything you want.
then do not bug me.
I am not bugging you. come and lie down. I will give you a massage.  where did you go today?
mid-town mostly.
oh yeah? what was happenin' there?
i picked up my ticket.  I am leaving in the morning, jez.
oh?  where you going?
west.
where is west? new jersey?
do not be funny.
i always liked the west, west of il- linois anyway. but you gotta give me time to pack.
stop it, jez. do not do that.
do what? i have not done a thing.
do not play games with me. there is nothing more to say.
where is sarah? where are the boys?
sit down, jake.
where are they?
sit down!
no! what is going on? where is my family?
it is over, jake. it is all over.
where have they gone?
wake up! stop playing with yourself. it is finished.
this is not happening.
your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, dr. singer.
oh god!
what is wrong, jake?  forget to take your antidote?
goddamn you!
i loved your chemist, jake. the height of fantasy. and your vision of paradise.  a most romantic creation. you are quite a dreamer, jake. only it is time to wake up.
who are you?
how many times have you asked me that? how many times?
tell me, damn you!
you know who i am.
daddy!
oh god!
you are hurting me!
stop!!!!
daddy. let go.
what do you want from me?
let go!
