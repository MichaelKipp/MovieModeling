you know, we did not call any tv repair.
well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?
you think you could do this like soon? it is almost six thirty.
what is the rush?
gosh, i loved that show. watched it for years.
that is not the reason. I have got a date at six thirty.
hey--who did muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles?
... her father.
right. and how did she dress him?
... like prince charming.
nice ... nice ...
um--hello? I have got like a social emergency here.
remember the one where bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
yeah ...
what department store did they go to?
mcintire's.
mcginty's.
no. mcintire's. remember:  "for the very best in men's attire, head right down to mcintire's."
that is right.
say--why do not you take this remote instead. it is got a little more "ooomph" in it.
ooomph?
sure. big beautiful set like this--you want something that will put you right in the show.
how much does it cost?
oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. it is free.
free?
oh sure. big fan like yourself. it is the least i could do.
lemme see that.
no way.
do you mind. this is like the most important moment of my whole life.
forget it jen, I have waited a year for this.
god, david. just give it to me!
get lost!
you get lost!
oh my god.
what happened?
I am not sure.
what did you do?
i do not know.
uchh! look at me?! I am like so ... pasty!
told you it was your lucky day. bet you thought i was just a fan or something.
what happened?
a miracle.
... see, every time i thought I would found someone they would turn out to disappoint me. they would know the early episodes, but they would not know the later ones ... they would know all about muffin but they would not know about bud ...
what the hell's going on!
shh! can not talk like that now. you are in ...  you know ...
bud. mary sue ... breakfast is on the table.
we are in pleasantville?
dream come true, hunh?
this is not funny! i happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
well, you do not have to worry about that anymore.
noooooo!
you--you gotta get us out of here.
why would i do that?
because we do not belong!
oh sure you do ... "mcintire's department store" ... "their father dressed as prince charming." that was gorgeous bud.
my name's david.
oh god ...
you know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
look--we appreciate it. we really do. we just--we want to go home now.
but you do not know how long I have been looking for someone like you.
do not get upset.
weil would not you! you look for someone for years ... you pour your heart into it ... this is a privilege you know.  i do not think i better talk about this right now.
where are you going ...
i do not think we should discuss this until I am a little bit more composed.
wait a minute!!
maybe in a day or so when I am not so emotional ...
come back!!!
oh god.
what is going to happen?
i do not know ... it is not possible ...  is it possible?
bu-ud ... mary sue ... your breakfast is getting cold.
it can not be possible.
i just love you in that sweater mary-sue. it is so flattering.
thanks.
i do not believe this.
neither do i.
i put blueberries in them just the way you like.
actually--i'm not real ... hungry.
oh nonsense young lady. you are going to start your day with a nice big breakfast.
I am going to hurl, david. i swear to god.
just take deep breaths.
all that animal fat. i feel it in my pores or something.
i still do not see why we are doing this.
we are supposed to be in school.
we are supposed to be at home david! we are supposed to be in color!  oh god ...
hello bud.
hello mr. simpson.
hear your dad got a new car.
oh yeah. a buick. it is swell.
you know him?
owns the hardware store.
okay, now you listen to me! i do not know what is going on but you would better fix it! i had a date with mark davis and i even bought new underwear!
we just got to play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. then I will talk to him and ...
play along?
well, yeah. I am ... bud parker and you are ... um--mary sue.
no! I am not going to do it! if i do not dress like this for mom I am sure as hell not going to do it for you!
we do not have a choice jen. we are stuck until he comes back.
why can not we just explain it?
to who?
what is all the commotion? where is the cat?
um ... it is ...
who is that?
biff martin. captain of the basketball team.
does he--you know--like "me"?
as a matter of fact he does.
hunh.
those are my friends.
peggy jane, lisa anne and betty jean.
can we do any better?
i do not think so.
oh god! are we in that episode?
what?
i do not believe it.
what is the matter?
you want to ask her out tonight, right? and then you want to give her your school pin ...
yeah ... how did you know?
lucky guess.  look, biff ... i do not think it is a real good time for that right now ...
what i mean is ... mary sue's been a little "different" lately ...
she will not go out with me?
i did not say that. it is just that right now ...
i do not know what I would do if she would not go out with me ...
no way.
one date, jen--that's all I am asking. if you do not go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
it is too weird david. this place is giving me the creeps. did you know all the books are blank?
what?
i looked in the library. they got covers with nothing inside them.
what were you doing in a library?
i got lost.  oh here ... look at this!
jennifer!
just watch. you know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'cause nothing burns around here, that is why! they do not need any firemen ...
jen, listen ...
i like--really need a cigarette, too.
I will get us out of here. i really will. but if we do not play along we could alter their whole existence. we may never get home.
i could like kill a guy with these things.
it is in your closet.
I have worn some kinky stuff before ...
he will not notice anyway.
what do you mean?
they do not notice that kind of thing.
so what is the point?
jen please ...
he-llo? I have got like three pounds of underwire here ...
just go with the program--hunh? I am late for work.
bud?
sorry ... i had to help my folks and then i could not find my hat ...
oh.
what is wrong?
well--i always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then i make the french fries ...
yeah ...
but you did not come so i kept on wiping.
you know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if i have not put out the napkins yet.
I am so glad you are here.
i understand.
there are not any cheeseburgers.
what?
well, usually i put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
listen to me!
do you have the lettuce?
... yeah.
have you cooked the burgers?
yes.
well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.
i sure am glad you said you would come out with me tonight mary sue.
well "gee whizz" biff. i sure am glad you asked me.
i do not know if i ever said this to you before, but, well ... i think you are just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
really biff? the keenest?
oh yeah.
gosh. i hardly know what to say.
... and you always seemed so smart and everything. like that report you did on "our town hall." gosh. i did not know what I would talk to you about.
well, sometimes talking's over-rated. do not you think?
hunh?  oh, right ...
so i know i have not been steady with anybody, but i just do not want to rush it. you do not want to make a mistake with something that important.
oh, gosh no.
i mean, there is kids that are even holding hands already but i figure there is plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. do not you?
oh you bet.  will you excuse me for a sec?
couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  if you need anything, I will be right over there.
gee whiz "bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
anyhow ... i really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
you want to get out of here?
what?
you wanna get out of here? you wanna leave?
but where would we go?
... lover's lane.
lover's lane!
sure is pretty.
oh yeah ... gorgeous.
to be honest mary sue. i did not think you would want to come here until we would been pinned for a little while.
oh, biff. you can "pin" me any time you want to.
why no. she is still on her date with biff ... is something the matter?
no, i ... i was just ... worried about her.
bud, your sister's a little older now and she is naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... in fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  that is if she can learn to bake.
oh, george ...
but your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
... why?
i think ... i might be ill ...
it is s'posed to happen, biff.
it is?
trust me ...
oh no ... I am fine.
how 'bout some marshmallow rice squares?
I am fine.
oh hi!
hi there. you took off so quick. i was not sure if you were okay.
oh, yeah. sorry. I am fine. i just ... had to get home early.
bud ...
yeah ...
you know how when we close up, i close the register, then you lower the shades, then i turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
yeah ...
well you were not around this time so i did the whole thing myself.
oh, hello betty.
hello bill.
what did you do to him?
nothing.
you can not do this, jennifer. i warned you.
so what is the big deal. oh. okay. they are like not good at basketball anymore. like--omigod, what a tragedy.
you do not understand. you are messing with their universe.
well maybe it needs to be messed with. did that ever like--occur to you?  you know, they do not want to be like this, it is just that nobody ever helped them before.
you have no right to do this.
well if i do not who will?
they are happy like this.
david, nobody's happy in a poodle skirt and a sweater set.  you like all this do not you?
i mean, you do not think it is just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  oh god! i am just so personally horrified right now ...
i just do not think we have the right to ...
david, let me tell you something. these people do not want to be geeks. they want to be "attractive." they have got a lot of potential, they just do not know any better.
they do not have that kind of potential.
um--hello? you want to like take a look?
what will it be?
gee whizz, bud. guess I will just have the usual. cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
me too. sounds swell.
really? it seems so fattening.
two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
there are not any cheeseburgers.
look. i thought we talked about this, i thought we said ...
oh--what's the point, bud?
well ... I am not sure i see the point anymore.
what are you talking about! you make hamburgers! that is the point!
no i know ... i know i do ...  but it is always the same, you know? grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... it never changes. it never gets any better or worse ...
just listen to me ...
... like the other night, when i closed up by myself. that was different ...
forget about that!
oh ... okay.  ... but i really liked it.
look, you can not always like what you do. sometimes you just do it because it is your job. and even if you do not like it, you just got to do it anyway.
why?
so they can have their hamburgers!
you know what i really like?
... what is that?
christmastime.
wow ... that is pretty good ...
thanks.  but this morning i was thinking about it and i realized that i looked forward to it all year. and then i thought "gee. that seems awfully silly. that seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, do not you think?"
well do not you?
i think you should try not to think about this anymore.
really?
yeah.
oh. okay. I will try that then.
mary sue?
yeah?
can i ask you a question?
sure.
what goes on up at lover's lane?
what do you mean?
well, you hear all these things lately. you know--kids spending so much time up there ...  is it holding hands? that kind of thing?
yeah ...  that--and ...
what?
it does not matter.
no. i want to know.
... sex.
ah.
you sure you want to know this?
yes.
okay.
yes ...  it is just that ...
what?
well ...  ... your father would never do anything like that.
that was sure swell ...
oh. thanks, margaret.
i baked you my oatmeal cookies.
oh, no ... you baked those for whitey.
no. i baked them for you.
no. you baked them for whitey.
no. i baked them for you.
i had nothing to do with that fire.
it is okay.
not directly anyhow ...
it is fine.
um ... they like wanna ask you a question ... i did not know how to handle it. so ...
sure.
how did you know about the fire?
what?
how did you know how to put it out and all?
and where is that?
um ... outside of pleasantville.
what is outside of pleasantville?
look it does not matter. it is not important.
what is it?
keeps going ...
well--it all just keeps going. roads ... rivers ...
"it was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."
i thought the books were blank?
okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. they asked me what it was about and i like did not remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, but i told them what i did remember, and the next thing i knew the pages had filled in.
the pages filled in?
but like only up to the part about the raft, because i did not read any farther.
want some bridge mix?
oh, no thanks ...
betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
I am fine--but thank you.
I am sure you have noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  you know what i mean by "changes"?
"changes."
"changes."  and it is not just the fire or big stuff like that. it is little things.  did you hear about bill miller?
no. what?
wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
one of those ... big beds?
oh my gosh. what is he going to to do?
i really do not know.  ben miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
... how?
no. they do. and it is not just 'cause you are a great bowler ... they respect you ...
thank you very much.
and it is important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what is right. if you love a place, you can not sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
no. of course not.
and that is why i want you to be on the pleasantville chamber of commerce.
oh my gosh. i hardly know what to say.
why do not you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
oh sure ... you bet.  betty ...
it is okay. it is alright.
i can not go out there. how can i go out there?
have you got any make up?
in my handbag.
does it look okay?
looks just like it did.
and they will not be able to tell?
no ... they will not be able to tell.
wait.
what?
thank you.
sure.
oh, hi.
hi.
are not you a little early?
i brought you something ... from the library.
it is an art book.
oh my gosh, bud ...
open it.
what is wrong?
I will never be able to do that.
oh, well--you're just starting out. i mean, you can not do it ...
no, that is not it.
hi.
oh ... hi.
look, i probably should not be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all ...
sure ... where would we go?
... lover's lane?
hello there.
... hi.
well c'mere, young fella.
so even though i can not make any promises, well--i figured if you asked me real nice--i might just be willing to talk about it again.
i can't.
what?
talk about it. right now, i mean. i got to ... um ...
bud--i thought you wanted to come home.
oh ... i do. yeah. it is just that i told my "dad" I would clean out the rain gutters and mr. johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
I will be honest with you bud. I am getting sorta concerned about what I am seeing in some of these re-runs ...
re-runs?
like when margaret henderson makes her cookies for whitey.  ... those are not your cookies bud.
oh, i know they are not. but i mean-- they are just "cookies" after all ...
excuse me?
well they are not just cookies. i mean, they are great cookies ... look, I would love to get into this whole thing but I am really running late. why do not we hook up tomorrow?
bud.
terrific. I will talk to you then.
what is wrong?
nothing.
nothing?
you are reading?
yeah. can not believe you started such a dorky fad.
d.h. lawrence. you ever heard of him?
... yeah.
seemed kinda sexy. look. i read 35 pages.
that is great.
so what is it?
well ... i just ...  can i ask you a question?
sure.
remember when you told me that lisa rosenberg liked me?
yeah ...
well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
no. she really liked you.
you were not playing a joke? she woulda gone out with me?
gone out with you. she woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
wow.
can i ask you a question?
yes.
how come I am still in black and white?
what?
well I have had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I am still like this. they have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they are in technicolor.
oh, i do not know. maybe ...  ... it is not just the sex ...
what?
um ... you gotta turn off main street.
oh ... right.
oh, hi ...
I am sorry ...
no, no ... come on in.
i just thought ... it is beautiful.
thanks.
having kind of a tough time.
i think it looks nice.
well ...  here's what it is s'posed to look like.
where did you get this?
bud brought it to me.
bud?
here's my favorite.
is not it great how she is resting like that?
she is crying.
what?
she is crying.
no she is not.
yes she is.
wait ...
I have got to go ...
it is alright.
it is alright. let me see.
no ...
mary sue--c'mon ...
what are you doing?
it is six-thirty ...
so.
we were gonna ... you know ...
oh.  i can't.
why not?
I am busy.
with what?
mmmmgh.
do they have those ... where you come from?
yeah ... i guess.  i do not know.
you do not know?
so what is it like?
what?
out there.
how?
well it is louder ... and scarier i guess ... and ... and a lot more dangerous ...
sounds fantastic. you know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes.
do they have an ocean? I have heard about the ocean.
yeah.
what is that like?
well it is big. and it is blue ...  ... it is really really blue.
mmmm.  boy. it is hot up here.
you want some berries?
hunh?
i picked them myself. they grow wild up here.  mmm. so sweet.
they just grow like that?
oh yeah. there is a lot of stuff. currants and strawberries ... here. I will show you.
what is that?
i do not know.
what is going on?
rain.
real rain?
yeah ... you do not have rain either?
what do we do?
we will just put up the top.
are you alright?  what is it?
rain.
real rain?
what happened?
well, i ... i came home like i always do, and i came in the front door. and i took off my coat. and i put down my briefcase and i said "honey. I am home."
you can not go out there.
but i really should get home.
but you can not go out there.
sounds nice ... once you get used to it.
yeah. it does.
like a drum.
yeah.  or like sprinklers in the summer ...
i told you where i was.
all night?
i got caught in the storm. you were gone all night too.
i was in a bowling-alley.
look. let's just forget about it. let's just go to the meeting and ...
i told you, george. I am not going.
sure you are.
no I am not.
look at me george. that meeting's not for me. look at my face.
it is fine. you will put on some make up and ...
i do not want to put on some make up ...
it goes away ... it will go away.
i do not want it to go away.
okay--now you listen to me ...  you are going to come to this meeting and you are going to put on this make up, and you are going to come home at six of the clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
no I am not sweetie.
i made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  I am going to go now.
where are you gonna go?
I am going to go now.
it is beautiful. where did you get it?
it was a prop for the school play ...
can i open it?
sure ...
i want a word with you ...
oh--well ...
now!
what do you mean?
what do i mean!  you think this is a toy? you think it is your own little goddamn coloring book ...
look--it just sort of "happened" ...
a deluge does not just "happen." bolts of lightning do not just "happen" ...  you burned down an elm tree for christ's sake ...
i had nothing to do with that.
oh. I am sorry--refresh my memory. what episode does the orgy happen in, again?
look ...
it was a gift bud. it was so special. you liked these things as much as i did, remember: warm smells in the family kitchen? a smile from a stranger? you know how rare that is?
... only if they mean it.
okay. now you are really starting to piss me off!
i did not do anything wrong.
oh no? let me show you something!
where is the remote control i gave you?
why?
because you are coming home. I am going to put this place back the way it was.
no you are not.
excuse me?
I am sorry ... i can not let you do that.
just gimme the goddamn remote!
ow!
I am going to leave now.
you are not going anywhere. you are going to get that remote and you are going to come home and we are going to make everybody happy again!!!
where are they?
I am not sure.
don't! just let go.
it is better, mary sue.
i said, no!  ... I have read like one book in my whole life and I will be damned if i let you throw it on that fire ...
it is okay. we will get you a new one.
i do not know what I would do if i could not paint anymore bud. i just do not know what I would do ...
did you do this?
yes i did.
do you know that it is illegal?
yes i do.
bud--why did you do this?
because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
you are not allowed to do this! i could arrest you for this.
still does not make it right.
dan! arrest them!
um ... i do not know how to do that, bob.
what do you mean!?
well, i never had to do it before.
you put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
oh. guess i could do that, then.
hope you are proud of yourself.
i am actually ... glad to see you have finally shown your true colors.
okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. where is that remote control?
why?
because you are coming home.
why do not you just take me back without it?
oh. you are a smart little bastard are not you?  it is kind of like a restricted ticket. you got to leave the same way you came.
so ... i guess as long as I am here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. we could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
just gimme the damn remote!
I am sorry. i can not do that.
i do not know what went wrong. you answered every question. you knew every detail. the senior prom ... mcintire's department store. we had all the same warm memories: sock hops. the church social ...
they were not my memories.  i borrowed them. it is no good when you borrow them.
how long do you think you have been here?
i do not know ... three, four weeks.
much less than that.  an hour and a half.
now buddy, you are going on trial tomorrow. and if they find you guilty, you are going to be stuck here forever. well, not forever--lemme think ...  five year sentence ... carry the three ... that comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that is rounding down.
I am going on trial tomorrow?
this is tv pal. they do not fool around.
there is worse places.
oh sure. for the first hundred years. then it starts to get a little monotonous.  sleep well.
bud parker and william johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the pleasantville code of conduct and laws of common decency. do you admit that on the night of may 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following forbidden colors to the pleasantville town hall:  red, pink, vermillion, puce, chartreuse, umber, blue, aqua, ox blood, green, peach, crimson, yellow, olive and magenta.
um ... yes i do. where is our lawyer?
we prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible. i do not think a lawyer will be necessary.
do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
well--it was dark out ...
good. do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
it was accessible to everyone.
very well. let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.
i think I have got something to say.
very well ...
it is like the basketball team.
the basketball team?
sure. everybody's upset because they are not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.
see, i know you want it to stay "pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like silly ... or sexy ... or dangerous ... or wild ... or brief ...  and every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  look at those faces back there. they are no different than you are. they just happened to see something inside themselves that you do not want to ...
okay--that's enough!
i thought i was allowed to defend myself.
you are not allowed to lie.
I am not lying ... here I will show you.
mr. simpson ...
yes.
what color is that hedge of yours?
green.
no, not that hedge. the other one.
the other one?
the one in your mind. the one that you see on a bright cold morning. the one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
maybe you can not even describe it. maybe you only know it when it is gone. maybe it is like there is a whole piece of you that is missing too.  you might even call it "love."
okay, that is it!!!
now do not you think she looks just as pretty in color? do not you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
you are out of order!
why am i out of order?
because i will not allow you to turn this courtroom into a circus!
well i do not think it is a circus. and i do not think they do either.
this behavior will stop at once.
but see that is just the point. it can not stop at once. because it is in you. and you can not stop something that is in you.
it is not in me.
oh sure it is.
no it isn't.
c'mon. everyone's turning colors. kids are making out in the street. no one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
that is not going to happen!
but it could happen.
no it couldn't!
are you sure?
i told you. I am like positive.
this thing works. we could go home right now.
I am not ready yet. i got to do this for a little while.
besides. you think there is like a chance I am going to get into college back there?
honestly ... no.
you got the admissions letter.
right here.
and you are sure about this?
I have done the slut thing, david. it is really kinda old.
you are going to forget about me.
no i won't. i swear.
i like calling you david.
i like it too.
well how do you know it will not go back to the way it was?
you are going to keep painting are not you?
it is beautiful.
just a little--you know.
i made you these for the trip. they are marshmallow rice squares.
thanks. i thought you were not going to ...
i had to say goodbye.
there is a meatloaf sandwich in there too. do not go skipping dinner just 'cause you are not here anymore.
i won't.
and ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
... it is a pretty short trip.
I am so proud of you, bud.
thanks ... i love you.
i love you too.
