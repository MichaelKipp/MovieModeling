yeah. tv busted?
yeah ...
well here i am.
holy cow. look at that. had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
yeah ... sort of ...
we'll get you fixed up in no time.
i know how i'd feel if mine went out. almost like losing a friend.
you know, we didn't call any tv repair.
well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?
you think you could do this like soon? it's almost six thirty.
what's the rush?
gosh, i loved that show. watched it for years.
that's not the reason. i've got a date at six thirty.
hey--who did muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles?
... her father.
right. and how did she dress him?
... like prince charming.
nice ... nice ...
um--hello? i've got like a social emergency here.
remember the one where bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
yeah ...
what department store did they go to?
mcintire's.
mcginty's.
no. mcintire's. remember:  "for the very best in men's attire, head right down to mcintire's."
that's right.
say--why don't you take this remote instead. it's got a little more "ooomph" in it.
ooomph?
sure. big beautiful set like this--you want something that'll put you right in the show.
how much does it cost?
oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. it's free.
free?
oh sure. big fan like yourself. it's the least i could do.
lemme see that.
no way.
do you mind. this is like the most important moment of my whole life.
forget it jen, i've waited a year for this.
god, david. just give it to me!
get lost!
you get lost!
oh my god.
what happened?
i'm not sure.
what did you do?
i don't know.
uchh! look at me?! i'm like so ... pasty!
told you it was your lucky day. bet you thought i was just a fan or something.
what happened?
a miracle.
... see, every time i thought i'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. they'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... they'd know all about muffin but they wouldn't know about bud ...
what the hell's going on!
shh! can't talk like that now. you're in ...  you know ...
bud. mary sue ... breakfast is on the table.
we're in pleasantville?
dream come true, hunh?
this isn't funny! i happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
well, you don't have to worry about that anymore.
noooooo!
you--you gotta get us out of here.
why would i do that?
because we don't belong!
oh sure you do ... "mcintire's department store" ... "their father dressed as prince charming." that was gorgeous bud.
my name's david.
oh god ...
you know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
look--we appreciate it. we really do. we just--we want to go home now.
but you don't know how long i've been looking for someone like you.
don't get upset.
weil wouldn't you! you look for someone for years ... you pour your heart into it ... this is a privilege you know.  i don't think i better talk about this right now.
where are you going ...
i don't think we should discuss this until i'm a little bit more composed.
wait a minute!!
maybe in a day or so when i'm not so emotional ...
come back!!!
oh god.
what's going to happen?
i don't know ... it's not possible ...  is it possible?
bu-ud ... mary sue ... your breakfast is getting cold.
it can't be possible.
i just love you in that sweater mary-sue. it's so flattering.
thanks.
i don't believe this.
neither do i.
i put blueberries in them just the way you like.
actually--i'm not real ... hungry.
oh nonsense young lady. you're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast.
i'm gonna hurl, david. i swear to god.
just take deep breaths.
all that animal fat. i feel it in my pores or something.
i still don't see why we're doing this.
we're supposed to be in school.
we're supposed to be at home david! we're supposed to be in color!  oh god ...
hello bud.
hello mr. simpson.
hear your dad got a new car.
oh yeah. a buick. it's swell.
you know him?
owns the hardware store.
okay, now you listen to me! i don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! i had a date with mark davis and i even bought new underwear!
we just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. then i'll talk to him and ...
play along?
well, yeah. i'm ... bud parker and you're ... um--mary sue.
no! i'm not gonna do it! if i don't dress like this for mom i'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
we don't have a choice jen. we're stuck until he comes back.
why can't we just explain it?
to who?
what's all the commotion? where's the cat?
um ... it's ...
who's that?
biff martin. captain of the basketball team.
does he--you know--like "me"?
as a matter of fact he does.
hunh.
those are my friends.
peggy jane, lisa anne and betty jean.
can we do any better?
i don't think so.
oh god! are we in that episode?
what?
i don't believe it.
what's the matter?
you want to ask her out tonight, right? and then you want to give her your school pin ...
yeah ... how'd you know?
lucky guess.  look, biff ... i don't think it's a real good time for that right now ...
what i mean is ... mary sue's been a little "different" lately ...
she won't go out with me?
i didn't say that. it's just that right now ...
i don't know what i'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
no way.
one date, jen--that's all i'm asking. if you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
it's too weird david. this place is giving me the creeps. did you know all the books are blank?
what?
i looked in the library. they got covers with nothing inside them.
what were you doing in a library?
i got lost.  oh here ... look at this!
jennifer!
just watch. you know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'cause nothing burns around here, that's why! they don't need any firemen ...
jen, listen ...
i like--really need a cigarette, too.
i'll get us out of here. i really will. but if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. we may never get home.
i could like kill a guy with these things.
it's in your closet.
i've worn some kinky stuff before ...
he won't notice anyway.
what do you mean?
they don't notice that kind of thing.
so what's the point?
jen please ...
he-llo? i've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
just go with the program--hunh? i'm late for work.
bud?
sorry ... i had to help my folks and then i couldn't find my hat ...
oh.
what's wrong?
well--i always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then i make the french fries ...
yeah ...
but you didn't come so i kept on wiping.
you know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if i haven't put out the napkins yet.
i'm so glad you're here.
i understand.
there aren't any cheeseburgers.
what?
well, usually i put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
listen to me!
do you have the lettuce?
... yeah.
have you cooked the burgers?
yes.
well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.
i sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight mary sue.
well "gee whizz" biff. i sure am glad you asked me.
i don't know if i ever said this to you before, but, well ... i think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
really biff? the keenest?
oh yeah.
gosh. i hardly know what to say.
... and you always seemed so smart and everything. like that report you did on "our town hall." gosh. i didn't know what i'd talk to you about.
well, sometimes talking's over-rated. don't you think?
hunh?  oh, right ...
so i know i haven't been steady with anybody, but i just don't want to rush it. you don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
oh, gosh no.
i mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but i figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. don't you?
oh you bet.  will you excuse me for a sec?
couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  if you need anything, i'll be right over there.
gee whiz "bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
anyhow ... i really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
you want to get out of here?
what?
you wanna get out of here? you wanna leave?
but where would we go?
... lover's lane.
lover's lane!
sure is pretty.
oh yeah ... gorgeous.
to be honest mary sue. i didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
oh, biff. you can "pin" me any time you want to.
why no. she's still on her date with biff ... is something the matter?
no, i ... i was just ... worried about her.
bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... in fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  that's if she can learn to bake.
oh, george ...
but your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
... why?
i think ... i might be ill ...
it's s'posed to happen, biff.
it is?
trust me ...
oh no ... i'm fine.
how 'bout some marshmallow rice squares?
i'm fine.
oh hi!
hi there. you took off so quick. i wasn't sure if you were okay.
oh, yeah. sorry. i'm fine. i just ... had to get home early.
bud ...
yeah ...
you know how when we close up, i close the register, then you lower the shades, then i turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
yeah ...
well you weren't around this time so i did the whole thing myself.
oh, hello betty.
hello bill.
what did you do to him?
nothing.
you can't do this, jennifer. i warned you.
so what's the big deal. oh. okay. they're like not good at basketball anymore. like--omigod, what a tragedy.
you don't understand. you're messing with their universe.
well maybe it needs to be messed with. did that ever like--occur to you?  you know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
you have no right to do this.
well if i don't who will?
they're happy like this.
david, nobody's happy in a poodle skirt and a sweater set.  you like all this don't you?
i mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  oh god! i am just so personally horrified right now ...
i just don't think we have the right to ...
david, let me tell you something. these people don't want to be geeks. they want to be "attractive." they've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
they don't have that kind of potential.
um--hello? you want to like take a look?
what'll it be?
gee whizz, bud. guess i'll just have the usual. cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
me too. sounds swell.
really? it seems so fattening.
two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
there aren't any cheeseburgers.
look. i thought we talked about this, i thought we said ...
oh--what's the point, bud?
well ... i'm not sure i see the point anymore.
what are you talking about! you make hamburgers! that is the point!
no i know ... i know i do ...  but it's always the same, you know? grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... it never changes. it never gets any better or worse ...
just listen to me ...
... like the other night, when i closed up by myself. that was different ...
forget about that!
oh ... okay.  ... but i really liked it.
look, you can't always like what you do. sometimes you just do it because it's your job. and even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
why?
so they can have their hamburgers!
you know what i really like?
... what's that?
christmastime.
wow ... that's pretty good ...
thanks.  but this morning i was thinking about it and i realized that i looked forward to it all year. and then i thought "gee. that seems awfully silly. that seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
well don't you?
i think you should try not to think about this anymore.
really?
yeah.
oh. okay. i'll try that then.
mary sue?
yeah?
can i ask you a question?
sure.
what goes on up at lover's lane?
what do you mean?
well, you hear all these things lately. you know--kids spending so much time up there ...  is it holding hands? that kind of thing?
yeah ...  that--and ...
what?
it doesn't matter.
no. i want to know.
... sex.
ah.
you sure you want to know this?
yes.
okay.
yes ...  it's just that ...
what?
well ...  ... your father would never do anything like that.
that was sure swell ...
oh. thanks, margaret.
i baked you my oatmeal cookies.
oh, no ... you baked those for whitey.
no. i baked them for you.
no. you baked them for whitey.
no. i baked them for you.
i had nothing to do with that fire.
it's okay.
not directly anyhow ...
it's fine.
um ... they like wanna ask you a question ... i didn't know how to handle it. so ...
sure.
how'd you know about the fire?
what?
how'd you know how to put it out and all?
and where's that?
um ... outside of pleasantville.
what's outside of pleasantville?
look it doesn't matter. it's not important.
what is it?
keeps going ...
well--it all just keeps going. roads ... rivers ...
"it was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."
i thought the books were blank?
okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. they asked me what it was about and i like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, but i told them what i did remember, and the next thing i knew the pages had filled in.
the pages filled in?
but like only up to the part about the raft, because i didn't read any farther.
want some bridge mix?
oh, no thanks ...
betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
i'm fine--but thank you.
i'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  you know what i mean by "changes"?
"changes."
"changes."  and it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. it's little things.  did you hear about bill miller?
no. what?
wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
one of those ... big beds?
oh my gosh. what's he gonna to do?
i really don't know.  ben miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
... how?
no. they do. and it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... they respect you ...
thank you very much.
and it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. if you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
no. of course not.
and that's why i want you to be on the pleasantville chamber of commerce.
oh my gosh. i hardly know what to say.
why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
oh sure ... you bet.  betty ...
it's okay. it's alright.
i can't go out there. how can i go out there?
have you got any make up?
in my handbag.
does it look okay?
looks just like it did.
and they won't be able to tell?
no ... they won't be able to tell.
wait.
what?
thank you.
sure.
oh, hi.
hi.
aren't you a little early?
i brought you something ... from the library.
it's an art book.
oh my gosh, bud ...
open it.
what's wrong?
i'll never be able to do that.
oh, well--you're just starting out. i mean, you can't do it ...
no, that's not it.
hi.
oh ... hi.
look, i probably shouldn't be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all ...
sure ... where would we go?
... lover's lane?
hello there.
... hi.
well c'mere, young fella.
so even though i can't make any promises, well--i figured if you asked me real nice--i might just be willing to talk about it again.
i can't.
what?
talk about it. right now, i mean. i got to ... um ...
bud--i thought you wanted to come home.
oh ... i do. yeah. it's just that i told my "dad" i'd clean out the rain gutters and mr. johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
i'll be honest with you bud. i'm getting sorta concerned about what i'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
re-runs?
like when margaret henderson makes her cookies for whitey.  ... those aren't your cookies bud.
oh, i know they're not. but i mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
excuse me?
well they're not just cookies. i mean, they're great cookies ... look, i'd love to get into this whole thing but i'm really running late. why don't we hook up tomorrow?
bud.
terrific. i'll talk to you then.
what's wrong?
nothing.
nothing?
you're reading?
yeah. can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
d.h. lawrence. you ever heard of him?
... yeah.
seemed kinda sexy. look. i read 35 pages.
that's great.
so what is it?
well ... i just ...  can i ask you a question?
sure.
remember when you told me that lisa rosenberg liked me?
yeah ...
well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
no. she really liked you.
you weren't playing a joke? she woulda gone out with me?
gone out with you. she woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
wow.
can i ask you a question?
yes.
how come i'm still in black and white?
what?
well i've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and i'm still like this. they have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
oh, i don't know. maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
what?
um ... you gotta turn off main street.
oh ... right.
oh, hi ...
i'm sorry ...
no, no ... come on in.
i just thought ... it's beautiful.
thanks.
having kind of a tough time.
i think it looks nice.
well ...  here's what it's s'posed to look like.
where'd you get this?
bud brought it to me.
bud?
here's my favorite.
isn't it great how she's resting like that?
she's crying.
what?
she's crying.
no she's not.
yes she is.
wait ...
i've got to go ...
it's alright.
it's alright. let me see.
no ...
mary sue--c'mon ...
what are you doing?
it's six-thirty ...
so.
we were gonna ... you know ...
oh.  i can't.
why not?
i'm busy.
with what?
mmmmgh.
do they have those ... where you come from?
yeah ... i guess.  i don't know.
you don't know?
so what's it like?
what?
out there.
how?
well it's louder ... and scarier i guess ... and ... and a lot more dangerous ...
sounds fantastic. you know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes.
do they have an ocean? i've heard about the ocean.
yeah.
what's that like?
well it's big. and it's blue ...  ... it's really really blue.
mmmm.  boy. it's hot up here.
you want some berries?
hunh?
i picked them myself. they grow wild up here.  mmm. so sweet.
they just grow like that?
oh yeah. there's a lot of stuff. currants and strawberries ... here. i'll show you.
what is that?
i don't know.
what's going on?
rain.
real rain?
yeah ... you don't have rain either?
what do we do?
we'll just put up the top.
are you alright?  what is it?
rain.
real rain?
what happened?
well, i ... i came home like i always do, and i came in the front door. and i took off my coat. and i put down my briefcase and i said "honey. i'm home."
you can't go out there.
but i really should get home.
but you can't go out there.
sounds nice ... once you get used to it.
yeah. it does.
like a drum.
yeah.  or like sprinklers in the summer ...
i told you where i was.
all night?
i got caught in the storm. you were gone all night too.
i was in a bowling-alley.
look. let's just forget about it. let's just go to the meeting and ...
i told you, george. i'm not going.
sure you are.
no i'm not.
look at me george. that meeting's not for me. look at my face.
it's fine. you'll put on some make up and ...
i don't want to put on some make up ...
it goes away ... it'll go away.
i don't want it to go away.
okay--now you listen to me ...  you're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
no i'm not sweetie.
i made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  i'm gonna go now.
where are you gonna go?
i'm gonna go now.
it's beautiful. where'd you get it?
it was a prop for the school play ...
can i open it?
sure ...
i want a word with you ...
oh--well ...
now!
what do you mean?
what do i mean!  you think this is a toy? you think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
look--it just sort of "happened" ...
a deluge doesn't just "happen." bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  you burned down an elm tree for christ's sake ...
i had nothing to do with that.
oh. i'm sorry--refresh my memory. what episode does the orgy happen in, again?
look ...
it was a gift bud. it was so special. you liked these things as much as i did, remember: warm smells in the family kitchen? a smile from a stranger? you know how rare that is?
... only if they mean it.
okay. now you're really starting to piss me off!
i didn't do anything wrong.
oh no? let me show you something!
where's the remote control i gave you?
why?
because you're coming home. i'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
no you're not.
excuse me?
i'm sorry ... i can't let you do that.
just gimme the goddamn remote!
ow!
i'm going to leave now.
you're not going anywhere. you're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody happy again!!!
where are they?
i'm not sure.
don't! just let go.
it's better, mary sue.
i said, no!  ... i've read like one book in my whole life and i'll be damned if i let you throw it on that fire ...
it's okay. we'll get you a new one.
i don't know what i'd do if i couldn't paint anymore bud. i just don't know what i'd do ...
did you do this?
yes i did.
do you know that it's illegal?
yes i do.
bud--why did you do this?
because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
you're not allowed to do this! i could arrest you for this.
still doesn't make it right.
dan! arrest them!
um ... i don't know how to do that, bob.
what do you mean!?
well, i never had to do it before.
you put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
oh. guess i could do that, then.
hope you're proud of yourself.
i am actually ... glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. where's that remote control?
why?
because you're coming home.
why don't you just take me back without it?
oh. you're a smart little bastard aren't you?  it's kind of like a restricted ticket. you gotta leave the same way you came.
so ... i guess as long as i'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. we could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
just gimme the damn remote!
i'm sorry. i can't do that.
i don't know what went wrong. you answered every question. you knew every detail. the senior prom ... mcintire's department store. we had all the same warm memories: sock hops. the church social ...
they weren't my memories.  i borrowed them. it's no good when you borrow them.
how long do you think you've been here?
i don't know ... three, four weeks.
much less than that.  an hour and a half.
now buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. and if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. well, not forever--lemme think ...  five year sentence ... carry the three ... that comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.
i'm going on trial tomorrow?
this is tv pal. they don't fool around.
there's worse places.
oh sure. for the first hundred years. then it starts to get a little monotonous.  sleep well.
bud parker and william johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the pleasantville code of conduct and laws of common decency. do you admit that on the night of may 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following forbidden colors to the pleasantville town hall:  red, pink, vermillion, puce, chartreuse, umber, blue, aqua, ox blood, green, peach, crimson, yellow, olive and magenta.
um ... yes i do. where's our lawyer?
we prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible. i don't think a lawyer will be necessary.
do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
well--it was dark out ...
good. do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
it was accessible to everyone.
very well. let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.
i think i've got something to say.
very well ...
it's like the basketball team.
the basketball team?
sure. everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.
see, i know you want it to stay "pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like silly ... or sexy ... or dangerous ... or wild ... or brief ...  and every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  look at those faces back there. they're no different than you are. they just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
okay--that's enough!
i thought i was allowed to defend myself.
you're not allowed to lie.
i'm not lying ... here i'll show you.
mr. simpson ...
yes.
what color is that hedge of yours?
green.
no, not that hedge. the other one.
the other one?
the one in your mind. the one that you see on a bright cold morning. the one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
maybe you can't even describe it. maybe you only know it when it's gone. maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  you might even call it "love."
okay, that's it!!!
now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
you're out of order!
why am i out of order?
because i will not allow you to turn this courtroom into a circus!
well i don't think it's a circus. and i don't think they do either.
this behavior will stop at once.
but see that's just the point. it can't stop at once. because it's in you. and you can't stop something that's in you.
it's not in me.
oh sure it is.
no it isn't.
c'mon. everyone's turning colors. kids are making out in the street. no one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
that's not going to happen!
but it could happen.
no it couldn't!
are you sure?
i told you. i'm like positive.
this thing works. we could go home right now.
i'm not ready yet. i gotta do this for a little while.
besides. you think there's like a chance i'm gonna get into college back there?
honestly ... no.
you got the admissions letter.
right here.
and you're sure about this?
i've done the slut thing, david. it's really kinda old.
you're gonna forget about me.
no i won't. i swear.
i like calling you david.
i like it too.
well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
you're gonna keep painting aren't you?
it's beautiful.
just a little--you know.
i made you these for the trip. they're marshmallow rice squares.
thanks. i thought you weren't gonna ...
i had to say goodbye.
there's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
i won't.
and ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
... it's a pretty short trip.
i'm so proud of you, bud.
thanks ... i love you.
i love you too.
how was your day?
oh, swell. you know, mr. connel said that if things keep going the way they are, i might be seeing that promotion sooner than i thought.
oh darling that's wonderful!  i always knew you could do it.
okay, whose window did bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
easy. mr. jenkins. what job did mr. jenkins have?
salesman. what did bud and mary sue name the cat they found in the gutter?
scout?
marmalade.
you're unbelievable. you'll win this thing for sure. when is it on?
marathon starts at 6:30. contest's tomorrow at noon.
a thousand dollars ... and it's on all night?
of course it is howard. that's why they call it a marathon.
hey.
hey.
saw you at the mall yesterday.
yeah ... saw you too.
so you watching pearl jam on mtv tonight?
yeah.
so uh ... maybe we could uh ...
cool.
cool.
what are you doing?
what are you doing?
david, cut it out. mark davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
well great. the pleasantville marathon starts at six thirty.
pleasantville marathon?
yeah. every episode ever.
omigod, i don't be-lieeeeve this! he's gonna like beeeee here!
weil great. you can watch tv upstairs.
upstairs! up-staiiirs! there isn't any stereo!
oh my god ...  oh my god ...
david, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
no you can't, jen! it's a new tv. it doesn't work without a remote.
tv repair.
tv repair?
yeah. tv busted?
yeah ...
well here i am.
holy cow. look at that. had a little disaster didn't ya fella.
yeah ... sort of ...
we'll get you fixed up in no time.
i know how i'd feel if mine went out. almost like losing a friend.
you know, we didn't call any tv repair.
well that makes it a lucky day for both of us, hunh?
you think you could do this like soon? it's almost six thirty.
what's the rush?
gosh, i loved that show. watched it for years.
that's not the reason. i've got a date at six thirty.
hey--who did muff in take to the masquerade ball when her date came down with the measles?
... her father.
right. and how did she dress him?
... like prince charming.
nice ... nice ...
um--hello? i've got like a social emergency here.
remember the one where bud lost his cousin when he was s'posed to be watching him?
yeah ...
what department store did they go to?
mcintire's.
mcginty's.
no. mcintire's. remember:  "for the very best in men's attire, head right down to mcintire's."
that's right.
say--why don't you take this remote instead. it's got a little more "ooomph" in it.
ooomph?
sure. big beautiful set like this--you want something that'll put you right in the show.
how much does it cost?
oh--couldn't charge you for something like that. it's free.
free?
oh sure. big fan like yourself. it's the least i could do.
lemme see that.
no way.
do you mind. this is like the most important moment of my whole life.
forget it jen, i've waited a year for this.
god, david. just give it to me!
get lost!
you get lost!
oh my god.
what happened?
i'm not sure.
what did you do?
i don't know.
uchh! look at me?! i'm like so ... pasty!
told you it was your lucky day. bet you thought i was just a fan or something.
what happened?
a miracle.
... see, every time i thought i'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. they'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... they'd know all about muffin but they wouldn't know about bud ...
what the hell's going on!
shh! can't talk like that now. you're in ...  you know ...
bud. mary sue ... breakfast is on the table.
we're in pleasantville?
dream come true, hunh?
this isn't funny! i happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
well, you don't have to worry about that anymore.
noooooo!
you--you gotta get us out of here.
why would i do that?
because we don't belong!
oh sure you do ... "mcintire's department store" ... "their father dressed as prince charming." that was gorgeous bud.
my name's david.
oh god ...
you know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
look--we appreciate it. we really do. we just--we want to go home now.
but you don't know how long i've been looking for someone like you.
don't get upset.
weil wouldn't you! you look for someone for years ... you pour your heart into it ... this is a privilege you know.  i don't think i better talk about this right now.
where are you going ...
i don't think we should discuss this until i'm a little bit more composed.
wait a minute!!
maybe in a day or so when i'm not so emotional ...
come back!!!
oh god.
what's going to happen?
i don't know ... it's not possible ...  is it possible?
bu-ud ... mary sue ... your breakfast is getting cold.
it can't be possible.
i just love you in that sweater mary-sue. it's so flattering.
thanks.
i don't believe this.
neither do i.
i put blueberries in them just the way you like.
actually--i'm not real ... hungry.
oh nonsense young lady. you're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast.
i'm gonna hurl, david. i swear to god.
just take deep breaths.
all that animal fat. i feel it in my pores or something.
i still don't see why we're doing this.
we're supposed to be in school.
we're supposed to be at home david! we're supposed to be in color!  oh god ...
hello bud.
hello mr. simpson.
hear your dad got a new car.
oh yeah. a buick. it's swell.
you know him?
owns the hardware store.
okay, now you listen to me! i don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! i had a date with mark davis and i even bought new underwear!
we just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. then i'll talk to him and ...
play along?
well, yeah. i'm ... bud parker and you're ... um--mary sue.
no! i'm not gonna do it! if i don't dress like this for mom i'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
we don't have a choice jen. we're stuck until he comes back.
why can't we just explain it?
to who?
what's all the commotion? where's the cat?
um ... it's ...
who's that?
biff martin. captain of the basketball team.
does he--you know--like "me"?
as a matter of fact he does.
hunh.
those are my friends.
peggy jane, lisa anne and betty jean.
can we do any better?
i don't think so.
oh god! are we in that episode?
what?
i don't believe it.
what's the matter?
you want to ask her out tonight, right? and then you want to give her your school pin ...
yeah ... how'd you know?
lucky guess.  look, biff ... i don't think it's a real good time for that right now ...
what i mean is ... mary sue's been a little "different" lately ...
she won't go out with me?
i didn't say that. it's just that right now ...
i don't know what i'd do if she wouldn't go out with me ...
no way.
one date, jen--that's all i'm asking. if you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
it's too weird david. this place is giving me the creeps. did you know all the books are blank?
what?
i looked in the library. they got covers with nothing inside them.
what were you doing in a library?
i got lost.  oh here ... look at this!
jennifer!
just watch. you know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'cause nothing burns around here, that's why! they don't need any firemen ...
jen, listen ...
i like--really need a cigarette, too.
i'll get us out of here. i really will. but if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. we may never get home.
i could like kill a guy with these things.
it's in your closet.
i've worn some kinky stuff before ...
he won't notice anyway.
what do you mean?
they don't notice that kind of thing.
so what's the point?
jen please ...
he-llo? i've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
just go with the program--hunh? i'm late for work.
bud?
sorry ... i had to help my folks and then i couldn't find my hat ...
oh.
what's wrong?
well--i always wipe down the counter and then you set out the napkins and glasses and then i make the french fries ...
yeah ...
but you didn't come so i kept on wiping.
you know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if i haven't put out the napkins yet.
i'm so glad you're here.
i understand.
there aren't any cheeseburgers.
what?
well, usually i put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
listen to me!
do you have the lettuce?
... yeah.
have you cooked the burgers?
yes.
well you can just put on the lettuce, finish the burger and pretend it was me doing it all along.
i sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight mary sue.
well "gee whizz" biff. i sure am glad you asked me.
i don't know if i ever said this to you before, but, well ... i think you're just about the keenest girl in the whole school ...
really biff? the keenest?
oh yeah.
gosh. i hardly know what to say.
... and you always seemed so smart and everything. like that report you did on "our town hall." gosh. i didn't know what i'd talk to you about.
well, sometimes talking's over-rated. don't you think?
hunh?  oh, right ...
so i know i haven't been steady with anybody, but i just don't want to rush it. you don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
oh, gosh no.
i mean, there's kids that are even holding hands already but i figure there's plenty of time for that kind of thing later on. don't you?
oh you bet.  will you excuse me for a sec?
couple of cheeseburgers and two cherry cokes.  if you need anything, i'll be right over there.
gee whiz "bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
anyhow ... i really wanted to come over and sit next to you in civics but ...
you want to get out of here?
what?
you wanna get out of here? you wanna leave?
but where would we go?
... lover's lane.
lover's lane!
sure is pretty.
oh yeah ... gorgeous.
to be honest mary sue. i didn't think you'd want to come here until we'd been pinned for a little while.
oh, biff. you can "pin" me any time you want to.
why no. she's still on her date with biff ... is something the matter?
no, i ... i was just ... worried about her.
bud, your sister's a little older now and she's naturally going to start going out with boys.  ... in fact pretty soon--she's even going to get married and make someone a good little home-maker like your mother here.  that's if she can learn to bake.
oh, george ...
but your sister is a fine young woman and she would never do anything for us to be concerned about.
... why?
i think ... i might be ill ...
it's s'posed to happen, biff.
it is?
trust me ...
oh no ... i'm fine.
how 'bout some marshmallow rice squares?
i'm fine.
oh hi!
hi there. you took off so quick. i wasn't sure if you were okay.
oh, yeah. sorry. i'm fine. i just ... had to get home early.
bud ...
yeah ...
you know how when we close up, i close the register, then you lower the shades, then i turn out the lights, then we both lock the doors.
yeah ...
well you weren't around this time so i did the whole thing myself.
oh, hello betty.
hello bill.
what did you do to him?
nothing.
you can't do this, jennifer. i warned you.
so what's the big deal. oh. okay. they're like not good at basketball anymore. like--omigod, what a tragedy.
you don't understand. you're messing with their universe.
well maybe it needs to be messed with. did that ever like--occur to you?  you know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
you have no right to do this.
well if i don't who will?
they're happy like this.
david, nobody's happy in a poodle skirt and a sweater set.  you like all this don't you?
i mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it.  oh god! i am just so personally horrified right now ...
i just don't think we have the right to ...
david, let me tell you something. these people don't want to be geeks. they want to be "attractive." they've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
they don't have that kind of potential.
um--hello? you want to like take a look?
what'll it be?
gee whizz, bud. guess i'll just have the usual. cheeseburger and a cherry coke.
me too. sounds swell.
really? it seems so fattening.
two cheeseburgers, two cherry cokes.
there aren't any cheeseburgers.
look. i thought we talked about this, i thought we said ...
oh--what's the point, bud?
well ... i'm not sure i see the point anymore.
what are you talking about! you make hamburgers! that is the point!
no i know ... i know i do ...  but it's always the same, you know? grill the bun, flip the meat, melt the cheese ... it never changes. it never gets any better or worse ...
just listen to me ...
... like the other night, when i closed up by myself. that was different ...
forget about that!
oh ... okay.  ... but i really liked it.
look, you can't always like what you do. sometimes you just do it because it's your job. and even if you don't like it, you just gotta do it anyway.
why?
so they can have their hamburgers!
you know what i really like?
... what's that?
christmastime.
wow ... that's pretty good ...
thanks.  but this morning i was thinking about it and i realized that i looked forward to it all year. and then i thought "gee. that seems awfully silly. that seems like an awfully long time to be waiting for just one moment, don't you think?"
well don't you?
i think you should try not to think about this anymore.
really?
yeah.
oh. okay. i'll try that then.
mary sue?
yeah?
can i ask you a question?
sure.
what goes on up at lover's lane?
what do you mean?
well, you hear all these things lately. you know--kids spending so much time up there ...  is it holding hands? that kind of thing?
yeah ...  that--and ...
what?
it doesn't matter.
no. i want to know.
... sex.
ah.
you sure you want to know this?
yes.
okay.
yes ...  it's just that ...
what?
well ...  ... your father would never do anything like that.
that was sure swell ...
oh. thanks, margaret.
i baked you my oatmeal cookies.
oh, no ... you baked those for whitey.
no. i baked them for you.
no. you baked them for whitey.
no. i baked them for you.
i had nothing to do with that fire.
it's okay.
not directly anyhow ...
it's fine.
um ... they like wanna ask you a question ... i didn't know how to handle it. so ...
sure.
how'd you know about the fire?
what?
how'd you know how to put it out and all?
and where's that?
um ... outside of pleasantville.
what's outside of pleasantville?
look it doesn't matter. it's not important.
what is it?
keeps going ...
well--it all just keeps going. roads ... rivers ...
"it was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."
i thought the books were blank?
okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. they asked me what it was about and i like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, but i told them what i did remember, and the next thing i knew the pages had filled in.
the pages filled in?
but like only up to the part about the raft, because i didn't read any farther.
want some bridge mix?
oh, no thanks ...
betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
i'm fine--but thank you.
i'm sure you've noticed the same things we all have--certain "changes" going on in the town.  you know what i mean by "changes"?
"changes."
"changes."  and it's not just the fire or big stuff like that. it's little things.  did you hear about bill miller?
no. what?
wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
one of those ... big beds?
oh my gosh. what's he gonna to do?
i really don't know.  ben miller's son just quit his job as a boxboy at the market.
... how?
no. they do. and it isn't just 'cause you're a great bowler ... they respect you ...
thank you very much.
and it's important for them to see someone they respect, stand up for what's right. if you love a place, you can't sit around and watch this kind of thing happen to it.
no. of course not.
and that's why i want you to be on the pleasantville chamber of commerce.
oh my gosh. i hardly know what to say.
why don't you start by saying "yes," and then getting me one of those swell pineapple kabobs.
oh sure ... you bet.  betty ...
it's okay. it's alright.
i can't go out there. how can i go out there?
have you got any make up?
in my handbag.
does it look okay?
looks just like it did.
and they won't be able to tell?
no ... they won't be able to tell.
wait.
what?
thank you.
sure.
oh, hi.
hi.
aren't you a little early?
i brought you something ... from the library.
it's an art book.
oh my gosh, bud ...
open it.
what's wrong?
i'll never be able to do that.
oh, well--you're just starting out. i mean, you can't do it ...
no, that's not it.
hi.
oh ... hi.
look, i probably shouldn't be asking you this--not knowing you that well and all ...
sure ... where would we go?
... lover's lane?
hello there.
... hi.
well c'mere, young fella.
so even though i can't make any promises, well--i figured if you asked me real nice--i might just be willing to talk about it again.
i can't.
what?
talk about it. right now, i mean. i got to ... um ...
bud--i thought you wanted to come home.
oh ... i do. yeah. it's just that i told my "dad" i'd clean out the rain gutters and mr. johnson wanted me to ... to change the tape in the register ...
i'll be honest with you bud. i'm getting sorta concerned about what i'm seeing in some of these re-runs ...
re-runs?
like when margaret henderson makes her cookies for whitey.  ... those aren't your cookies bud.
oh, i know they're not. but i mean-- they're just "cookies" after all ...
excuse me?
well they're not just cookies. i mean, they're great cookies ... look, i'd love to get into this whole thing but i'm really running late. why don't we hook up tomorrow?
bud.
terrific. i'll talk to you then.
what's wrong?
nothing.
nothing?
you're reading?
yeah. can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
d.h. lawrence. you ever heard of him?
... yeah.
seemed kinda sexy. look. i read 35 pages.
that's great.
so what is it?
well ... i just ...  can i ask you a question?
sure.
remember when you told me that lisa rosenberg liked me?
yeah ...
well--did she really like me or were you just making that up.
no. she really liked you.
you weren't playing a joke? she woulda gone out with me?
gone out with you. she woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
wow.
can i ask you a question?
yes.
how come i'm still in black and white?
what?
well i've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and i'm still like this. they have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
oh, i don't know. maybe ...  ... it's not just the sex ...
what?
um ... you gotta turn off main street.
oh ... right.
oh, hi ...
i'm sorry ...
no, no ... come on in.
i just thought ... it's beautiful.
thanks.
having kind of a tough time.
i think it looks nice.
well ...  here's what it's s'posed to look like.
where'd you get this?
bud brought it to me.
bud?
here's my favorite.
isn't it great how she's resting like that?
she's crying.
what?
she's crying.
no she's not.
yes she is.
wait ...
i've got to go ...
it's alright.
it's alright. let me see.
no ...
mary sue--c'mon ...
what are you doing?
it's six-thirty ...
so.
we were gonna ... you know ...
oh.  i can't.
why not?
i'm busy.
with what?
mmmmgh.
do they have those ... where you come from?
yeah ... i guess.  i don't know.
you don't know?
so what's it like?
what?
out there.
how?
well it's louder ... and scarier i guess ... and ... and a lot more dangerous ...
sounds fantastic. you know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes.
do they have an ocean? i've heard about the ocean.
yeah.
what's that like?
well it's big. and it's blue ...  ... it's really really blue.
mmmm.  boy. it's hot up here.
you want some berries?
hunh?
i picked them myself. they grow wild up here.  mmm. so sweet.
they just grow like that?
oh yeah. there's a lot of stuff. currants and strawberries ... here. i'll show you.
what is that?
i don't know.
what's going on?
rain.
real rain?
yeah ... you don't have rain either?
what do we do?
we'll just put up the top.
are you alright?  what is it?
rain.
real rain?
what happened?
well, i ... i came home like i always do, and i came in the front door. and i took off my coat. and i put down my briefcase and i said "honey. i'm home."
you can't go out there.
but i really should get home.
but you can't go out there.
sounds nice ... once you get used to it.
yeah. it does.
like a drum.
yeah.  or like sprinklers in the summer ...
i told you where i was.
all night?
i got caught in the storm. you were gone all night too.
i was in a bowling-alley.
look. let's just forget about it. let's just go to the meeting and ...
i told you, george. i'm not going.
sure you are.
no i'm not.
look at me george. that meeting's not for me. look at my face.
it's fine. you'll put on some make up and ...
i don't want to put on some make up ...
it goes away ... it'll go away.
i don't want it to go away.
okay--now you listen to me ...  you're gonna come to this meeting and you're gonna put on this make up, and you're gonna come home at six o'clock every night and have dinner ready on this table.
no i'm not sweetie.
i made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ...  i'm gonna go now.
where are you gonna go?
i'm gonna go now.
it's beautiful. where'd you get it?
it was a prop for the school play ...
can i open it?
sure ...
i want a word with you ...
oh--well ...
now!
what do you mean?
what do i mean!  you think this is a toy? you think it's your own little goddamn coloring book ...
look--it just sort of "happened" ...
a deluge doesn't just "happen." bolts of lightning don't just "happen" ...  you burned down an elm tree for christ's sake ...
i had nothing to do with that.
oh. i'm sorry--refresh my memory. what episode does the orgy happen in, again?
look ...
it was a gift bud. it was so special. you liked these things as much as i did, remember: warm smells in the family kitchen? a smile from a stranger? you know how rare that is?
... only if they mean it.
okay. now you're really starting to piss me off!
i didn't do anything wrong.
oh no? let me show you something!
where's the remote control i gave you?
why?
because you're coming home. i'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
no you're not.
excuse me?
i'm sorry ... i can't let you do that.
just gimme the goddamn remote!
ow!
i'm going to leave now.
you're not going anywhere. you're gonna get that remote and you're gonna come home and we're gonna make everybody happy again!!!
where are they?
i'm not sure.
don't! just let go.
it's better, mary sue.
i said, no!  ... i've read like one book in my whole life and i'll be damned if i let you throw it on that fire ...
it's okay. we'll get you a new one.
i don't know what i'd do if i couldn't paint anymore bud. i just don't know what i'd do ...
did you do this?
yes i did.
do you know that it's illegal?
yes i do.
bud--why did you do this?
because anybody should be able to paint in whatever color they want.
you're not allowed to do this! i could arrest you for this.
still doesn't make it right.
dan! arrest them!
um ... i don't know how to do that, bob.
what do you mean!?
well, i never had to do it before.
you put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
oh. guess i could do that, then.
hope you're proud of yourself.
i am actually ... glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.
okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. where's that remote control?
why?
because you're coming home.
why don't you just take me back without it?
oh. you're a smart little bastard aren't you?  it's kind of like a restricted ticket. you gotta leave the same way you came.
so ... i guess as long as i'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. we could have pink lawns and blue trees ...
just gimme the damn remote!
i'm sorry. i can't do that.
i don't know what went wrong. you answered every question. you knew every detail. the senior prom ... mcintire's department store. we had all the same warm memories: sock hops. the church social ...
they weren't my memories.  i borrowed them. it's no good when you borrow them.
how long do you think you've been here?
i don't know ... three, four weeks.
much less than that.  an hour and a half.
now buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. and if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. well, not forever--lemme think ...  five year sentence ... carry the three ... that comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.
i'm going on trial tomorrow?
this is tv pal. they don't fool around.
there's worse places.
oh sure. for the first hundred years. then it starts to get a little monotonous.  sleep well.
bud parker and william johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the pleasantville code of conduct and laws of common decency. do you admit that on the night of may 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following forbidden colors to the pleasantville town hall:  red, pink, vermillion, puce, chartreuse, umber, blue, aqua, ox blood, green, peach, crimson, yellow, olive and magenta.
um ... yes i do. where's our lawyer?
we prefer to keep these proceedings as "pleasant" as possible. i don't think a lawyer will be necessary.
do you further admit that this was done surreptitiously and under the cover of darkness?
well--it was dark out ...
good. do you further admit that this unnatural depiction occurred in full public view where it was accessible to, and in plain sight of, minor children?
it was accessible to everyone.
very well. let the record show that the defendants have answered in the affirmative to all the charges.
i think i've got something to say.
very well ...
it's like the basketball team.
the basketball team?
sure. everybody's upset because they're not winning anymore--but just think how it would feel if all of a sudden they do win.
see, i know you want it to stay "pleasant" but there are so many things that are so much better: like silly ... or sexy ... or dangerous ... or wild ... or brief ...  and every one of those things is in you all the time if you just have the guts to look for them.  look at those faces back there. they're no different than you are. they just happened to see something inside themselves that you don't want to ...
okay--that's enough!
i thought i was allowed to defend myself.
you're not allowed to lie.
i'm not lying ... here i'll show you.
mr. simpson ...
yes.
what color is that hedge of yours?
green.
no, not that hedge. the other one.
the other one?
the one in your mind. the one that you see on a bright cold morning. the one that you see when you walk in front of your house and you just stand there and stare.
maybe you can't even describe it. maybe you only know it when it's gone. maybe it's like there's a whole piece of you that's missing too.  you might even call it "love."
okay, that's it!!!
now don't you think she looks just as pretty in color? don't you think she looks just as pretty as she did the day you met her?
you're out of order!
why am i out of order?
because i will not allow you to turn this courtroom into a circus!
well i don't think it's a circus. and i don't think they do either.
this behavior will stop at once.
but see that's just the point. it can't stop at once. because it's in you. and you can't stop something that's in you.
it's not in me.
oh sure it is.
no it isn't.
c'mon. everyone's turning colors. kids are making out in the street. no one's getting their dinner-- hell, you could have a flood any minute ... pretty soon you could have the women going off to work while the men stayed home and cooked ...
that's not going to happen!
but it could happen.
no it couldn't!
are you sure?
i told you. i'm like positive.
this thing works. we could go home right now.
i'm not ready yet. i gotta do this for a little while.
besides. you think there's like a chance i'm gonna get into college back there?
honestly ... no.
you got the admissions letter.
right here.
and you're sure about this?
i've done the slut thing, david. it's really kinda old.
you're gonna forget about me.
no i won't. i swear.
i like calling you david.
i like it too.
well how do you know it won't go back to the way it was?
you're gonna keep painting aren't you?
it's beautiful.
just a little--you know.
i made you these for the trip. they're marshmallow rice squares.
thanks. i thought you weren't gonna ...
i had to say goodbye.
there's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
i won't.
and ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
... it's a pretty short trip.
i'm so proud of you, bud.
thanks ... i love you.
i love you too.
