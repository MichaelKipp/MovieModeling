i warned you about playing that shit when I am in the car.
that was my cd.  do not you ever touch a chinese man's cd.
did you see the way those girls drove off?  i did you a favor.
those girls drove off because of you.
all i did was invite them for a drink.
you invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat.
i said that?  which word was "goat?"
you owe me a copy of the beach boys greatest hits, volume two.
do not be giving me attitude, lee.  I have been here three days and we have not done shit.  we have not been to a club, have not even talked to a girl.  I am on vacation, and i want some mu-shu.
mu-shu?  you are hungry?
not mu-shu.  mu-shu.  i want to see some women.  now stop playing dumb and show me the shu!
lee, there was a bombing at the american embassy.  two american translators were killed.
any leads?
we think it is ricky tan.  if you do not want to take the case, I will understand.
it is my responsibility.
of course not.  my superindendent invited us to a club tonight.  big party.
do not be messing with me, lee.  i will kick your ass.  I will hit you so hard you will end up in the ming dynasty.
carter, would i lie to you?
that is what I am talking about.  a real hong kong night club.  you want an altoid?
no.
you better take one.  your breath has been a little funky all day.  let me look at you.
just relax and do not worry about a thing.  I will hook you up in there.  you got condoms?
no.
take this.  it is a magnum.  you can fold it in half.
I will meet you at the bar in ten minutes. they do not like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
blend in?  I am two feet taller than everyone here.  where you going?
bathroom.
carter, get off that stage!
are you kidding, they love me.  I am a star, lee.  a god to these people!
this is a gangster bar, we are here undercover.
i knew you were lying.
I am sorry.
damn it, why are you ruining my night? I am just starting to have fun.  well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing.
no, we are here for information, to find out where a man named ricky tan is.  we must tread softly and keep our ears open.
tread softly?  who taught you how to roost a bar?
carter, you do not understand.  these men are fu-cang-long triads.  part of the most deadly gang in china.
man, are you crazy?  you think that scares me?  I am from  l.a.  we invented gangs.  we were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  we get royalties from other gangs.  now gimme your badge and gun and I will show you how it is done.
no.  you are a civilian.  in china, i am michael jackson, and you are toto.
you mean tito.  we had  toto for dinner last night.
what did i say?
you just said you are their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
shit.  c'mon, get up here and help me out.
all i wanted was a little mu-shu.
try to land on your feet.
you lied to me.
I am sorry.
you are sorry.  i got somebody is old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so do not tell me you are sorry.  just take me home.
no time.  there was an explosion at the american embassy today -- two american translators were killed.
I am telling you right now, I am tired of this shit.  there is two billion chinese - let one of them be your partner.
this will not take long.
did not i teach you to always arch your back?
yes, master.
i need your help, master.  I am seeking a man who used to train with you.  he is become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
animals kill only from hunger or fear. the man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
he was the best i ever trained, you know.
ricky tan?
no.  your father.  your father and ricky tan were my favorite students... and for such awful things to happen as they did --
a seeding spends its entire life reaching towards heaven.
i know, master, but...
the answers you seek can be found in heaven on earth.
heaven on earth?  master, i do not understand.  a temple, where heaven is on earth?  a mountain, where earth reaches for the --
it is a massage parlor downtown.  "heaven on earth."  you will find your answers there.
and that is how you use the lapd choke hold.  now start practicing and do not make me come back here!
carter...you ready to have some fun!?
just follow my lead and act like a tourist.
i am a tourist.
hello.
how you doin'?
my friend is on vacation, from america. i want to show him a good time.
oh, you american?
that is right.
you bring american money?
never leave home without it.  lee, this one's on me.  you save your money.
you get massage from chinese girl before?
no.  it is my first time.
you pick any girl for you and your friend.
any girl?  okay.  let's start with that one.
oh yes, she is very nice.
she is nice.  but i am very tense.  I am going to need a lot of massages.  I will take that one, too.  how you doin', baby? and...that one in pink.  she can do my feet.
what are you doing?
she said i could pick any girl i want.
well, hurry up.
hey!  you do not break in front of a black man in a buffet line.
what is wrong?
over there -- that is ricky tan.
that is ricky tan?  he is four feet tall. I will go over with you right now, shake him down.
this is a very dangerous man.
I am a dangerous man.  you are not going to ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat.
I am calling for back up!
I am busy at the moment.
i said get on your feet!
i know you, detective carter, right? you are lee's american friend.  enjoying your visit?
I am lee's new muscle, his right arm -- and do not let the robe fool you.  this is the only color they had left.  now get up!
lee, I have missed you, brother.  i heard about the two americans, I am so sorry, you must be under great pressure.
you must come with me for questioning.
let's go.  I have got girls and chicken and hot oil waiting for me.
i do not think so...
I would like to pay you for that laptop.
it is no problem.  but i must excuse myself, inspector.
that is chief inspector, he got promoted.
goddamn you got a small ass.
do not look at my ass!
chin, you have been ordered by the ministry of public security to assist the fbi and secret service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  if you have information, it belongs to us.
this is still hong kong.
two americans have been killed on united states government property -- this is our investigation.
chief inspector lee will brief your people...
no.  he will report to me.  do we understand each other?
who the hell is that?
that is...chief inspector lee.  the detective in charge of our investigation.
put a diaper on him, chin.  i want to talk to the great inspector lee.
where are you going?
back to heaven on earth.  i need my damn passport back.  I am going home.
fine.  go home.  who needs you.
why you mad at me?  you needed back-up, so i backed you up.  i was about to take out ricky tan and those bodyguards.
stop!  I am sick of your bullshit!
my bullshit?  I am not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I am not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords!
it is my job!
you are pathetic, man.  when is the last time you had some fun?  when is the last time you took a night off, had a date?
i have plenty of dates.
really?  when is the last time you had some mu-shu  let's hear it, lee, when was it?  year of the rat?
you would never understand my life. you are not chinese.
and you am not black!
lee, this is special agent sterling from the united states secret service.
the secret service?  why?
is it true, carter?  are you in hong kong right now?
hong kong?  I am not in hong kong.  I am in hollywood -- right at sunset and vine, two minutes from the station.  how about i pick you up right now and take you to dinner?
it is nine-thirty in the morning.
did i say dinner?  i meant diner. biscuits and gravy, you love that shit.
do you know what happened yesterday, carter?  i was officially nominated for the commissioner's post for the lapd. there was a dinner last night, two hundred lapd officers were there.
two hundred cops?  was mario sanchez there?  he owes me money.
I have waited my whole life for this job, but i do not have a shot in hell of getting it.  do you know why?
is it because of the hookers, sir?  you tell them there is no crime in being lonely.
no, carter.  the reason I am screwed is because the entire department is about to find out the stolen credit cards we impounded were used to buy two first class upgrades to hong kong.  and what the hell is heaven on earth?
sir, I am working on a big case over here -- and by the time i get back they are going to make you governor.  captain, you there?  hello?  shit!
all he wanted was some mu-shu.
are you okay, lee?
lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  ricky tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  victoria harbor.  if you do not want to...
did you tell sterling?
let him find out on his own.  i want the hong kong police handling this.
thank you.
invitation, please.
I am with the band.  I am the lead singer.
the band has been playing over an hour.
i got held up at a wedding in tai koo. ricky here yet, i need to get his requests.
wait.
last party all he wanted was sting -- not one person danced.  tonight I am doing superfreak, i do not care what he says.  where is he?
mr. tan is not to be disturbed by the help.
how you doing, baby?  my name is prince mubutu from nigeria.
isabella molina, from san juan.  that seat is taken.
san juan!  you must know my good friend pedro martinez hernandez hector elizondo.
i do not think so.
I am sorry, you looked like you traveled in the best circles.  but hey, i understand.  make yourself at home, isabella.  champagne, caviar, whatever you want.  my ship is your ship.
this is your ship?
that is right.  I am the owner, the captain -- you can call me el capitan.
el capitan?
i do not want to play games with you, isabella.  i like you.  i can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes.
well, I am very tempted.  it is such a beautiful yacht.  what is it called?
called?  what is my ship called?  well...it's called the s.s. minnow johnson.
the s.s. minow johnson.  funny, the name on the back was "red dragon."
red dragon?  you sure about that?
I am sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  and it is his party.
your friend's ship?  oh, man.  i must have walked onto the wrong yacht.  i knew there was a reason my keys did not work.
wait a second.  you are steven reign? you are big time.  you own all them big hotels.  what are you doing in hong kong?
I am just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights.
carter?
who died?
you.
detective yu?  never met him.
not yu.  you!
who?
do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?
nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth.
could you have your partner wait for us outside?
i am not his partner, I am a tourist.  i got proof.  see, i got a mini-bar key.
what, leave you alone so he can cap you?
I am okay, you go.
why the hell should you believe him?  he had us beat up.  naked.  that is nasty shit.
remember i told you my father was a policeman?  ricky tan was his partner for ten years.
what the hell is going on here?
despite what people suspect...what you suspect --
don't.
... if your father were alive, i would be turning to him now.  i did not blow up the american embassy, but i believe some of my people did.  my enemies are trying to frame me.  there is a war going on within the triads -- and i am going to lose.  my name has been written into the book of death.
the police can protect you.
nobody can protect me.  I will make a deal with you, lee.  but only iff you will get me out of hong kong.
tell me why they killed the customs agents.
there is a ship, in the hong kong harbor...
quite a night, inspector.  ricky tan was our only bait, and now he is gone.  you finally got your revenge - at the expense of a u.s. government investigation.
what "revenge" is he talking about?
i do not know if the fu-cang-long paid you to get rid of tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you are off this case.  i do not ever want to see you again, you got that?
hey, you, secret service man, what are you --
stay out of it, carter.  you are going back to l.a.
fine with me.
escort detective carter to the airport --
I will take him.
what are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
I will bitch slap you into bangkok.
give me your best shot, you flat assed mama's boy.
do not be talking about my mama.  or my ass!
i heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
no.  she is a school teacher.
you are not very good at this, are you?
good at what?
forget it.
five years ago, my father was chief inspector working a big international smuggling case.
ask me if i give a shit.
he found out his partner, tan, had been working for the triads all along.  before my father could prove it, he was killed in the line of duty.
how the hell did tan get away with it?
all the evidence against him disappeared, the smuggling case was unsolved.  tan resigned and went over to the triads openly.
this is about your daddy's death?  hell, lee, you know my father died on the job. you could have told me...  this is about more than all that, is not it?  this is about your daddy's last case, right?
no, no, that would be crazy --
you thought the "customs agents get blown up" and "smuggling" and "ricky tan" and you put it all together and came up with a five year old case. that is why you did not tell me what we were doing...
i thought you would think it was crazy.
it is crazy!
i know.  i know.  i am sorry.
so are you getting on the plane or not?!
what?
come on, we still got time to order the kosher meal.  always get the kosher meal, they bring it first.
i cannot go to la...
it sounds impossible --
you said --
-- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I would go to hell to do it.
you want to figure out why they killed your daddy, get on the plane.
why la?
i guess you are going to have to trust me on this one.
i should go back.  ricky tan mentioned a boat in hong kong harbor...
lee, let me introduce you to the carter theory of criminal investigation: follow the rich white man.
follow the rich white man?
almost, but you have got to say "rich white man" all run together like it is one word.
follow the richwhiteman...
not bad.  now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. every single one.  now in our case, we know the rich white man is steven reign.
who?
big hotel billionaire.  he was on ricky tan's boat ordering hu li around just before ricky got smoked.
how do you know he is our man?
because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  see most white people, when there is shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "aaaahhh!!! aaaahh!!!!
you sound like that all the time.
black people keep their cool when the shit goes down.
maybe.  but not like asians.  we never panic.
yeah, what about when godzilla was coming?  you people were screaming your asses off.
just tell me where i can find this steven reign.
the same place you find all richwhitemen.  gefilte fish.  lox and bagel.  i love this stuff.  here, try it with a smear.
yeah, that is definitely the woman from ricky tan's boat, and she is staying in his suite at his hotel, i told you this would work out.  they still just talking?
he just left.  kissed her on the cheek.
he will be back soon.
how do you know?
look at her.  now, wake me in an hour, I will take over.
carter, there is something i have to tell you.  you were right about what you said in hong kong.  all i do is work.  never take a day off.  it is all i have right now.
hey, i did not mean to call you pathetic.
the truth is, i have not had any mu-shu in six months.
you pull a muscle or something?
my fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
I am sorry, lee.  why did she leave you?
it is a long story.
let me guess, she could not handle the cop thing -- never knowing if you were dead or alive.  I have seen it a million times.
no.  it was my singing.
excuse me?
she hated my voice.  said it drove her crazy.  i sang to her all the time - in bed - in the shower - i thought she liked it.  she finally told me it was driving her crazy.
she is just standing around -- not doing much.
just do not fall asleep.  sooner or later something is going to happen.
I will try to stay awake.  it is so boring.
slow down, baby.
what did you say?
nothing.  i said nothing.
is it hot in here?
hot?  I am freezing my ass off.
I am going to go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  you want some ice?
what is going on?
she is getting undressed.
gimme the binoculars.
no.  it is not right.
gimme the binoculars or i will shoot you.
what is she doing?
oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
i do not want to hear this.
skirt just came off.  she is in black bra and panties -- victoria secret spring catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there is a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like snoopy.
snoopy?  i love snoopy.
she just took her hair down.  now she is going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she is using both hands.  you better get that ice.
wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
what?
she is reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  oh, god...please do not let it be a dick.
what is it?
no, i do not believe this shit -- it is a microphone.  lee, she is wired...
i do not understand?
she is walking back towards the door.
pick it up!
it is your turn!
i do not need a turn!
wait!  there is people down there!
there is people up here!
get it out of here!
take it!
i would not do that!!!
it is a bomb.
you see, no bomb.  now stay away before i throw you both in jail for obstruction.
throw us in jail?  I am about to bust you right now.
I am an undercover agent for the united states secret service.
how do we know you are not lying?  let me see your badge.
let me see it again?
we can help you.  I am a detective in hong kong.
i know who you are, inspector lee.
then you know I am not walking away from this case.
yeah, that is right.
we need to get out of sight.  come down to my suite.
look, I have been working this case for months now...
so what is your story?
they think I am a crooked customs agent.
is this a payoff?
no.  it is a sample.  you guys ever heard of the superbill?
it is a myth.  some kind of counterfeit.
it is much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can not tell the difference.  the paper is crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on u.s. intaglio presses.
how're they getting into the u.s. mint to use the presses?
in 1959, the united states was very friendly with the shah of iran.  we wanted his oil, so for the shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a u.s. treasury intaglio press.  the only one to ever leave the country. five years ago ricky tan bought that press on the black market.
it was not hard to spot the fakes until this past year.  then tan got hold of one of a kind swiss made hundred dollar plates -- and started making superbills.
and hu li killed him for the plates.
yes.  they have printed and shipped one hundred million dollars, and there is only one way to spot a fake.
they use an optical transfer ink from india that burns red -- the real ink burns black.
what the hell are they going to do with a hundred million dollars in funny money?
the real question is, where are the plates?  if we can find the plates, we can stop the whole operation.
secret service agent carter.  this is my calling, lee. give me six months and I will be in washington protecting a white guy.
we both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
they do not know that.  what are they going to do, try and shoot the president during the interview?  I will bet isabella can pull some strings.  you saw the way she was staring at me.
she never even looked at you.
you are just jealous 'cos the girl picked me.  I am tall, dark and handsome, you are third world ugly.
i am not third world ugly.  women like me, they think I am cute.  like snoopy.
snoopy is about six inches taller than you.  I am sorry, lee, you never had a chance.
hear you got your ass kicked in hong kong, james.
what??  where did you hear that?
i got my sources.
and i got mine, meaning you.  nice how that works out.  I am serious this time, I am closing this place down.
james, you see my kids back there?  you know how much I am paying for private school?  how can you come in here with this attitude, you being little chang's godfather?
little chang is going to have to go visit his daddy in jail if you do not cooperate.
jail!?  james, you better back off. badge or no badge, I will kick your ass.
I would like to see you try.
master ching taught me.
the praying mantis school, in bejing?
no.  freddy ching's, in crenshaw.
what are you doing hanging out with baby duck?
baby duck?
that is what we all used to call him when he was a kid -- cause he was always quacking.  never shut up.
look, i need some info and i do not have time to play around.
is this about the funny money?
how did you know?
you have been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  how come you always save me for last, james? when are you going to learn.  shit do not happen i do not know about.
so tell me what you know.
i know teddy wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, did not you?
yeah.  we already been there.  this is big, kenny.  benjamins.  secret service calls 'em superbills.  banks can not even tell the difference.
what?
one of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  i was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  i knew something was wrong.  cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. but i tested the bills, infrared.  the whole thing.  and they checked out. 100%.
do you still have the bills?
i still have my lunch money from third grade.
i knew it.  the guy's name is zing.  he works at the kitchen at reign plaza.
all right, kenny.  thanks.  you are off the hook.  for now.
are you okay?
what is the first thing i told you -- never trust nobody.  how could you fall for that shit?  i knew she was dirty.
she saved our lives.
for how long?  face it, lee, she is playing both sides.
look, man I am sorry.  i know you got a thing for her.
shhh, my head hurts.
I am about to be killed and you "shhh" me!  this was not my case, lee.  ricky tan did not kill my father, the fu-cang long are not in south central.  i did not have to help you.
why did you help me?
it does not matter.
I am not used to having a partner.
we are not partners.  between your daddy, my daddy, and the beating i just took, as far as i can tell all partners get you is dead.
well we are not friends.
you got that right.  and we am not brothers.  maybe we should just end this right here.
fine with me.
i will not talk to you, you do not talk to me.  we will die in peace.
see you in the next world.
i do not believe in reincarnation.  so i will not see you in the next world.
fine.
i believe in heaven.  you people believe in heaven?
yes.  we have heaven.
is it the same heaven, or is it a chinese heaven?
what is a chinese heaven?
i thought it might be like those five foot and under basketball leagues.  they do not let everybody in.
i think we should stop talking.
fine by me.
you thinking about that girl that dumped you?
no.
if she was the right girl, you would be thinking about her.
mind your own business.
how was the sex?
there was no sex.  she was very traditional.  we were waiting until we were married.
you are kidding.  no sex?  nothing?  no mu-shu?
no mu-shu.
what about a little king pao chicken?
no kung pao chicken.  never.
steamed dumplings?
once in a while, steamed dumplings.  but only when she was drunk.
that is rough, man.  if i do not get steamed dumplings once a week, i go crazy.
tell me the truth, carter.  do you think i have a good voice?
are you serious?
forget it.  it does not matter.
as long as you are asking...i think you have a pretty good voice.
i knew it.  what does she know.  you want me to sing something?
that depends.  how do the fu-cang-long usually kill their victims?
they will probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head.
go ahead.  sing your ass off.
very nice.
it is focus.  every opponent has a weak spot.  you ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike.
I will remember that next time I am fighting a box.
hello, benjamin.
who is benjamin?
benjamin franklin, he discovered electricity.
a chinese man discovered electricity.
no chinese man discovered electricity.
yes he did.  he also invented the bicycle.
now that i believe.
we are slowing down.  this must be it.
end of the line.
you have been a good friend, james carter.
oh no you don't.  do not you be getting corny on me, lee.  I will kick your ass from here to compton.
you could never kick my ass.  you mama's boy.
do not you talk about my mama.  that is more like it.
vegas...
lee.  i just got an idea how someone could launder a hundred million dollars in cash.
red dragon.
that was the name of ricky tan's boat.
let's go.
wait a second.  we can not go in like this.  look at this place, we got to look fly.  we got to mac out.
what is mac out?
follow me my asian brother.
couple?  no, you got it wrong, there is no couple here.  just two single police officers working a very dangerous case.
yes.  we have lots of big men chasing us.
that looks exactly like my uncle darrell.
buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune.
buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. the man has the biggest tits in asia.
carter...here comes the rich white man.
wait here.  I will handle this.
put your arms around me.
excuse me?
what is going on?
i need your help.
last time you needed my help i ended up in the back of a truck.
I am undercover.  i had no choice.  you have to trust me.
you move well.
just trying to make it look real.
look over there.  that is the eye in the sky room.
behind me is the soft count room.  we are pretty sure the plates are back there.
why do not you go get them?
if I am wrong then my cover is blown.
stevie, how is it going my man?  somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot.
detective carter, you always seem to show up where you do not belong.
lemme ask you something, steven.  and i want the truth.  is there any way i can date your daughter?  just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz...
vegas has been my town for 30 years.  i crawled out from under the first rock. do you really think you can intimidate me here?
you are right, you are a smart guy.  most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  but this is an even swap.  pure genius.
you play games with me, detective, and you will lose every time.  do not forget. the odds are always in favor of the house.
the secret service almost busted reign at his casino in macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
how do i know i can trust you?
dip me!
I am asking for real now -- will you help the secret service?
no.  but I will help you.
lee, what the hell are you doing?
dancing?
dancing?  I am out here trying to strong arm steven reign, putting my life on the line, and you are up here dancing with some bimbo.  did she have a friend?
it was isabella.  she says the plates are in the soft count room.
isabella?  are you crazy, man?  she almost got us killed.  she is setting you up again!
no.  I am going to find out.
wait a second.  there is guards all over the place.  you will need a distraction.
I will go to the craps table, make a big scene.  when security comes over, you make your move.
try to keep them busy for five minutes.
I will give it my best shot.
what the hell is that?
those are five hundred dollar chips.
did you give me five-hundred dollar chips because I am black?
no, i just assumed...
you assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  are you a racist?
no, sir.
everyone else at the table has thousand dollar chips, but the black man gets the nickel, is that it?  did my people survive two-hundred years of slavery so you could send us back to the cotton fields with five-hundred dollar chips? do i look like chicken george to you?

ricky tan is alive.
what?!?!
we have to get to the penthouse.
you go after ricky.  i got this.
carter...
just go!
are you okay?
I am fine.
i did not know which side you were on.
now you know.
you are just like your father, lee.  all these years hiding behind his badge.  i wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  when you think about it, i did not really kill him.  i just put him out of his misery.
put the plates down.  it is over.
i do not think it is over.  there are casinos all over this country.  let me make you a rich man, lee.  do not make the same mistake he did.
if you reach for that gun, I am going to kill you.
do not you remember?  I am already dead.
would you like me to tell you how your father died?
lee, you okay?
lee, wait a second.  it is not worth it, man.  he is making you do this.
it is worth it to me.
do you have it in you, lee?  or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?
c'mon, lee.  he is going to jail.  you won, now just put the gun down.
we made it, man.
no problem.
i saw that.  she kissed you, did not she? you played it cool, though.  walking away, never looking back.
she is going home to new york.  i need some ice.
that your gate down there?
yes.
I am this way.  i guess this is goodbye.
i guess so.  thank you, carter.
you take care of yourself, lee.
your father's badge?  no way, man.  i can not take this.
it is okay.  i can finally let it go.
what is this?
about fifty grand.  i won it at the tables.
no, carter.  i can not take this.
it is okay, i got lots more.
they owe us, man.  that is the least they can do.
this money is evidence.
come on, lee.  stop being a cop for five minutes and live it up.  there must be something you want.
i always wanted to go to madison square garden.  see the knicks play.
new york city?
first class.
the plaza hotel?
a little mu-shu.
some kung-pao?
i could use a little vacation.
amen to that, brother.
