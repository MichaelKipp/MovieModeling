and what if i do not want to give up on her?
you do not call.
but you said i should not call if i wanted to give up on her.
right.
so i do not call either way.
right.
so what is the difference?
the only difference between giving up and not giving up is if you take her back when she wants to come back. see, you can not do anything to make her want to come back. you can only do things to make her not want to come back.
so the only difference is if i forget about her or pretend to forget about her.
right.
well that sucks.
it sucks.
so it is almost a retroactive decision. so i could, like, let's say, forget about her and when she comes back make like i just pretended to forget about her.
right... or more likely the opposite.
right... wait, what do you mean?
i mean first you will pretend not to care, not call -- whatever, and then, eventually, you really will not care.
unless she comes back first.
ah, see, that is the thing. somehow they do not come back until you really do not care anymore.
there is the rub.
there is the rub.
thanks, man. sorry we always talk about the same thing all the time...
hey man, do not sweat it.
...it's just that you have been there. your advice really helps.
no problem.
rob, i just want you to know, you are the only one i can talk to about her.
thanks. thanks, man.
michael, this is grandma. i want to know if you got the part on that television program. i told the whole family and they are very excited to know if...  skipping message. end of final message.
shit.
you have to put things in perspective.
i know, i know.
you have been through worse.
you are right. i know.
ever since I have known you.
i do not know about that.
moving here from new york was much more of an adjustment than this.
it did not feel that way.
that is because it was a challenge. you has control over you are situation. it was hard, but you rose to it.
okay. I will think about that. bye.
you really should. life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
enough. I have got to use the phone.
are you calling her?
no. stop, come on.
hello?
s'up trent?
lemme get off the other line, baby.
you should call your grandmother.
shuddup.
that was sue. we got two parties tonight. one's for a modeling agency.
i do not know...
listen to me, baby, there are going to be beautiful babies there.
trent, i do not feel like going out tonight. i got shit to do tomorrow...
listen to you. i got an audition for a pilot at nine and I am going. you got to get out with some beautiful babies. you can not sit home thinking about her.
i do not know...
i do not know, i do not know -- listen to you. we are going to have fun tonight. we got to get you out of that stuffy apartment.
we are going to spend half the night driving around the hills looking for this party and then leaving cause it sucks, then we are going to look for this other party you heard about. but, trent, all the parties and bars, they all suck. i spend half the night trying to talk to some girl who is eyes are darting around to see if there is someone else she should be talking to. and it is like I am supposed to be all happy cause she is wearing a backpack. half of them are nasty skanks who would not be shit if they were not surrounded by a bunch of drunken horny assholes. I am not going to be one of those assholes. it is fucking depressing. some skank who is not half the woman my girlfriend is is going to front me? it makes me want to puke.
you got it bad, baby. you need vegas.
what are you talking about? vegas?
vegas.
what vegas?
we are going to vegas.
when?
tonight, baby.
you are crazy.
I will pick you up in a half an hour.
I am not going to vegas.
shut up -- yes you are. now listen to tee. we will stop at a cash machine on the way.
i can not lose more than a hundred.
just bring your card. half an hour.
wait.
what?
what are you wearing? i mean, we should wear suits.
oh... now mikey wants to be a high roller.
no, seriously, if you are dressed nice and you act like you gamble a lot, they give you free shit.
okay bugsy. twenty minutes.
wear a suit, I am telling you it works.
be downstairs. you are beautiful.
i took out three hundred, but I am only going to bet with one. i figure if we buy a lot of chips, the pit boss will see and they will comp us all sorts of shit, then we trade back the chips at the end of the night. you got to be cool though.
I am cool, baby. they are going to give daddy a room, some breakfast, maybe bennett's singing.
I am serious. this is how you do it. I am telling you.
i know. daddy's going to get the rainman suite. vegas, baby. we are going to vegas!
vegas! you think we will get there by midnight?
baby, we are going to be up by five hundy by midnight. vegas, baby!
vegas!
vegas, baby!
vegas!
vegas.
vegas.
wake up, baby.
whu?
look at it, baby. vegas, baby!
pirates of the fucking caribbean.
this is the hot new place, besides, you love pirates. tell me mikey does not love pirates.
this is fuckin' post-pubescent disneyland.
you gotta love the pirates, baby. the pirates are money.
this place is dead. i thought this was the city that never sleeps.
that is new york, baby. you should know that. look at the waitresses. I am going to get me a peg-leg baby.
they are all skanks.
baby, there are beautiful babies here.
tee, the beautiful babies do not work wednesdays midnight to six. this is the skank shift.
what are you talking about? look at all the honeys.
cut that shit out.
she smiled baby.
that is not cool.
did she, or did she not smile?
it does not matter...
I am telling you, they love that shit.
you are going to screw up our plan.
we are going to get laid, baby.
first let's see what happens if we play it cool.
what? you think she is going to tell her pit-boss on us?
do not make fun, i think we can get some free shit if we do not fuck around.
who is fucking around? I am not making fun. let's do it, baby.
the trick is to look like you do not need it, then they give you shit for free.
well, you look money, baby. we both look money.
that is where we make our scene.
you think they are watching?
oh, they are watching all right. they are watching.
on the table.
sorry?
you have to lay it on the table.
uh, i do not want to bet it all.
you are not allowed to hand me money, sir. you will have to lay it on the table if you want me to change it.
oh... right.
huh?
you want this in black chips.
sure, that will be fine.
do you have anything smaller?
yes, but I am afraid this table has a hundred-dollar-minimum bet. perhaps you would be more comfortable at one of our lower stakes tables.
double down.
what?!?
double down, baby. you gotta double down on an eleven.
i know, but...
you gotta do it.
...but that is two hundred dollars. this is blood money...
if we do not look like we know what we are doing, then we may as well...
I am telling you, baby, you always double down on an eleven.
yeah? well obviously not always!
always, baby.
I am just saying, not in this particular case.
always.
but i lost! how can you say always?!?
...well, you know, not counting the first table.
thanks for clarifying that.
hey, man, I am down too, you know.
yea, how much?
i do not know, what? thirty, forty maybe.
do not give me that shit. you know exactly how much you lost. what did you drop?
twenty... but i was down at least fifty. I am sorry, i got hot at the crap table.
you won. there is nothing to be sorry about. you are a winner. I am the fuckin loser. i should be sorry.
baby, do not talk like that, baby.
let's just leave.
baby, you are money. you are the big winner.
let's go.
who is the big winner?
mikey's the big winner.
what an asshole.
okay, tee's the asshole, but mikey's the big winner.
there you two are. i walked around for an hour with that stupid martini on my tray.
sorry. we got knocked out pretty quickly.
a couple of high rollers like you?
could you believe it?
wait here, I will get you that martini.
nah, i did not really want it anyway. i just wanted to order it.
can i get you something else? i mean, you should not leave without getting something for free.
no thanks. why ruin a perfect night.
what an asshole.
that was money. tell me that was not money.
that was so demeaning...
she smiled, baby.
i can not believe what an asshole you are.
did she, or did she not smile.
she was smiling at what an asshole you are.
she was smiling at how money i am, baby.
let's go. I am not paying for a room, and if we do not leave now we will never make it.
leave? the honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
what are you, nuts? you think she is coming back?
i know she is coming back.
i do not think so.
baby, did you hear her? "you should not leave without getting something for free." she wants to party, baby.
you think so?
you got to give tee one thing. he is good with the ladies.
I am too tired for this. let's just go.
baby, this is what we came for. we met a beautiful baby and she likes you.
she likes you.
whatever. we will see. daddy's going to get her to bring a friend. we will both get one. i do not care if I am with her or one of her beautiful baby friends.
i do not know...
you got to get that girl out of your head. it is time to move on. you are a stylish, successful, good looking cat. the ladies want to love you, you just got to let them.
that is bullshit.
it is not. you are money. any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
it is just that I have been out of the game so long. trent, i was with her for six years. that is before aids. I am scared. i do not know how to talk to them, i do not know...
you can not think like that, baby. it is hard, i know. I have been there. not for six years, but i know. you just got to get back out there.
it is just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who does not know what i like... and you got to wear a jimmy...
...gotta...
...and then I am struggling to impress some chick who is not half as classy as my girlfriend, who I am not even really attracted to...
oh fuck that. you do not have to try and impress anyone. you think i give a shit? you think i sweat that skanky whore waitress...
...one fifty-nine, two minutes.
two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
beautiful. what time are you off...  ...christy?
six.
that was so fuckin' money. it was like that "jedi mind" shit.
that is what I am telling you, baby. the babies love that stuff. they do not want all that sensitive shit. you start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. they know what you want. what do you think? you think they don't?
i know. i know.
they know what you want, believe me. pretending is just a waste of time. you are going to take them there eventually anyway. do not apologize for it.
I am just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...
respect, my ass. they respect honesty. you see how they dress when they go out? they want to be noticed. you are just showing them it is working. you got to get off this respect kick, baby. there am not nothing wrong with letting them now that you are money and that you want to party.
are you ready to order?
coffee...  two coffees. it says "breakfast any time", right?
that is right.
I will have "pancakes in the age of enlightenment".
and you?
I will have the blackbeard over easy.
I will be back with the coffee.
nice, baby.
i should have said renaissance, right? it went over her head.
baby, you did fine.
"age of enlightenment". shit. like some waitress in a las vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure french philosophical reference. how demeaning. i may as well have just said "let me jump your ignorant bones."...
...baby...
...it's just, i thought "renaissance" was too excaliber, it is the wrong casino. she would have gotten it, though...
you did fine. do not sweat her. we are meeting our honeys soon. you know christy's friend is going to be money.
i hope so.  we gotta go soon.
baby, relax. it is just down the hall. she is got to change... we will be fine.
we did not do so bad after all.
baby, we are money.
excuse me. we are in a bit of a hurry.
hang on, voltaire.
hi, boys, we almost gave up on you.
oh, are we late? there are no clocks in this town.
well, no harm done. this is lisa. I am sorry, i never got your names...
I am mike...  and this is my friend "doubledown trent".
stop.  ladies, do not you double down on an eleven?
always...
no matter what... like splitting aces.
whatever.
hello, lisa. I am trent. what a lovely makeup job.
lisa works at the mgm grand...
I am a "dorothy".
oh... a dorothy.
well... we are not in kansas anymore.
what do you guys do?
I am a comedian.
do you ever perform out here? I would love to see you.
no...
you should. a lot of comics play vegas.
well, I am afraid it is not that easy...
why not?
there are different circuits... it is hard to explain... you would not understand...
who is your booking agent?
oh? you know about booking agents... i don't, uh, actually have a west coast agent as of yet...
well, who represents you back east?
actually, it is funny you... I am actually, uh, between...
what do you do, trent?
no... no... the worst was when i went in for this after-school special and I am sitting in the waiting room with all these little kids. i see they are all signed in for the same role as me...
they were auditioning for the same role as you?
wait... wait... listen... so, i check the time and place. I am where I am supposed to be. i call my agent... she says they asked for me specifically...
what was the part?
oh... "i love you... i can not believe you are doing this... drugs are bad..." whatever. after-school bullshit. the role is brother.
"big brother", "little brother"?
wait... wait... just "brother". so i go in. "hello... hi... we loved your guest spot on baywatch... blah blah blah..." whatever. so, i start to read, and, mikey, i was money. i prepared for a week. it is a starring role. I am crying... the casting director, she starts crying...
no!
yes!
oh my god.
did you get it?
wait...  she is crying. i finish. i hold up my finger like "wait a second". they sit in silence for, like, at least five minutes. i look up and they all start clapping, and now they are all crying. even the camera guy.
no! not the camera guy!
I am telling you!
...so give me the fuckin part...
right?... that i nailed it... whatever. then he says it is just that I am a little old. I am like "how old is the brother?". he is like, he says this with a straight face, i swear to god, he says "eleven."
so, what did you say to him? "double down."?
it is like, you looked at my tape. you saw my picture. why did you call me in? you knew i was twenty-four.
what an asshole.
let me just check on my boy.
do not worry. he is in good hands.
I am sure she will call. six years is a long time. you do not just break it off cleanly after six years.
i know, but she did. she is with someone else now...
already? you poor thing. it will not last.
why not?
it is a rebound.
we were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
yeah, but how long was the relationship she was rebounding from?
six years.
can i check my messages? i have a calling card.
sure, i guess. the phone's in the back.
sorry, it is just that...
i understand.
no, man. i need to use the phone.
what?
i gotta use the phone.
baby, you will check them tomorrow.
please, tee. i have to use the phone. sorry, man.
hold on.
the poor thing. six years?
...and she is with someone else.
the poor thing. I will make some coffee.
he is so sweet. he really said that?
i believe it too. he really just wants her to be happy.
he is so sweet.
she asked me what i was thinking about? what should i have done? lie?
you did not have to get into it, baby.
sorry about interrupting...
do not worry about me, baby. i just wanted you to have a good time.
christy was nice...
i did not even like her, to be honest.
she was hot.
she really did not do it for me, baby. how did you like dorothy?
i do not know. the whole judy garland thing kind of turned me on. does that makes me some kind of fag?
no, baby. you are money.
she did not like me, anyway.
she thought you were money.
i do not think so.
i heard them talking. they both thought you were money.
yeah, a good friend.
baby, you take yourself out of the game. you start talking about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it is going to be on the friend tip.
i just do not think she liked me in that way.
baby, you are so money you do not even know it.
tee, girls do not go for me the way they go for you.
michelle went for you, right.
that was different.
how?
i was younger... it was college. you did not go to college, you do not know what it is like. you screw chicks you have no business being with. they are young, they do not know any better.
that is just plain silly. your self- esteem is just low because she is with someone else. but thinking about it and talking about it all the time is bad. it is no good, man. you got to get out there. the ladies want to love you, baby.
i just need some time...
why? so you can beat yourself up? sitting around in that stuffy apartment. it is just plain bad for you, man. it is depressing. you have come so far. remember the first week? after she told you? you could not even eat.
do not remind me.
you just sat around drinking orange juice. now look at you. look how far you have come in just a few months. you got that part in that movie...
...a day...
...whatever. it is work. you are doing what you love. what is she doing?
selling scrap metal.
see? and what does this guy she is with do?
he drives a carriage.
what?!?
i hear he drives a carriage around central park or something.
please. and you are sweating him? you are "all that" and you are sweating some lawn jockey?
i hear she is getting real fat.
baby, she is the one who should be thinking about you. sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. trust me, mikey, you are better off.
i do not think I am going to take it.
it is a gig.
i mean, i need the money.
you are an actor. find the zen in the role.
it is definitely a step back for me.
look, there is not much of a call for shakespeare in this town.
there is just something about being "goofy". any other disney character would be fine. there is just this stigma associated with the character.
what do you want? you are tall.
do you realize how hard it is going to be to tell my parents? i still have not told them i did not get the pilot.
you tested over a month ago. I am sure they figured it out by now.
it is like "hi, mom. I am not going to be starring in that sitcom and, oh by the way, I am goofy. send more money."
have not you noticed i did not mention michelle once today?
i did not want to say anything.
why?
i do not know. it is like not talking to a pitcher in the midst of a no hitter.
what? like, you did not want to jinx it?
kinda.
i do not talk about her that much.
oh no?
i did not mention her once today.
well, until now. tend the pin.
the only reason i mentioned her at all is to say that I am not going to talk about her anymore. i thought you would appreciate that.
i do. good for you, man.
I have decided to get out there.  go ahead. play it out.
you want to hit the town tonight?
i shouldn't, mike, it is a weeknight.
what do you have? a pluto call back?
sure. kick me when I am down.
how many strokes?
i do not know. eight or nine.
I will give you an eight.
what did you get?
an eight.
looks like we are in a dead heat after one hole. this is turning into quite a rivalry.
bitch... you little bitch!
chelios to roenick...!
you little bitch!
hey sue. gretsky's on his ass again.
because he is a bitch.
that is so bullshit. this is so bullshit.
you should play another team. the kings are bitches in this game.
hey, man. i took the kings to the cup.
...against the computer.
they are a finesse team...
they are a bitch team... score! roenick!
fuck!!! that is so bullshit!
i wish the game still had fights so i could bitch-slap wayne.
this version does not have fighting?
no. does not that suck?
what? that was the best part of the old game.
i do not know. i guess kids were hitting each other or something.
you could make their heads bleed, though.
yeah... if you hit them hard their heads bleed all over the ice and their legs convulse.
no.
yeah.
it is kinda money, actually.
make someone bleed.
no, man, we are in the play-offs.
pause it.
give me the money. I will get it.
is he cute? ask him if he wants to stay for a cocktail!
...is he brown?
you guys are such assholes.
aww... he got away?
what time's this party tonight?
it starts at eight...
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
so, what? eleven?
who? rob?
yeah. you met him once.
yeah. he is a "rounder".
what is he do?
he is trying to be an actor.
what a surprise...
...how novel.
so, if the party starts at eight, why are we first going to a bar at ten?
to get a drink before we meet the guys for a bite at eleven.
oh.  where is this place?
it is one of these. for some reason, cool bars in l.a. have to be very hard to find and have no signs out front.
that does not sound too good for business.
it is kinda like a speakeasy kind of thing. it is kinda cool. it is like you are in on some kind of secret. you tell a chick you have been some place, it is like bragging that you know how to find it. the only way you could know where a place is is if someone who knows brought you there. you have to have someone come before. there is a direct line connecting you back to the original, unequivocally cool, club patrons. it is kinda like judaism...
sounds more like aids...
...that's probably a more appropriate analogy.
kinda money, huh?
classy.
I will get a dewars rocks...
bud.
...a dewars on the rocks and a bud, please.
i can not get over how cute the girls in this city are.
i know. it is like the opposite of inbreeding. the hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
darwinism at its best.
I have been around here six months and i still can not get over it.
it is like, every day i see a beautiful woman. I am not used to that. I am used to seeing a beautiful woman, i do not know, once a week. i can not handle it.
wait till summer. i swear, you can not leave the house. it hurts. it physically hurts.
i can not wait till i actually get to touch one of them.
ah, there is the rub...
there is the rub.
charles! what is up, man?
oh. you know.
did you, um, did you get that pilot?
no, man. i know you did not get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. it was not that funny anyway...
...piece of shit. listen, charles, this is my friend rob from back east.
hi.
my pleasure.
charles and me went to network on this pilot together.
i just tested for one...
...yeah, a month ago.
oh, I am sorry. how did your folks take it?
i have not heard an official "no" yet.
you have not told then, huh?
no.
i still have not told my folks i did not get "deepspace 9". you would think they'd'a figured it out by now, but mom keeps asking...
...and boy does it hurt when they ask.
i do not even tell them about anything I am close on anymore...
...not until you book it...
...and even then...
...you might get cut out.
I am considering taking a job as a "goofy".
hey, man. at least it is disney.
you want to come with us to a party at the chateau marmont? they got a bungalow and lots of beautiful babies.
why not? this place is dead anyway.
...the copa, in new york...
...through the kitchen...
...i heard it took four days to light for that shot...
...four days..?
...maybe. i mean you gotta hide all the lights...
...it looked money.
...how can you compare them? tarantino totally bites everything from scorsese...
...he's derivative...
...what's the big deal? everyone steals from everyone.
well, let's hit that party.
who threw this party, anyway?
damned if i know...
what is that guy's name? sue?
sue. his dad was big johnny cash fan.
oh, like that song...
..."a boy named sue". i think that is why he is such a bad cat.
him?
he is a mean dude. I have seen him smash a guy's face into the curb. he knocked out his teeth... blood... he was just like boom, boom, boom... fuckin nasty shit, man. he is a nice guy though.
oh, it is on, baby...
...it's on.
there are so many beautiful women here.
it is unbelievable.
i got to at least try once.
you are a better man than i am, charlie brown.
no, i just promised myself I would give it a try. i got to get out there sooner or later.
go for it, man.
I am going in. will you be my wing- man?
I will be your winger.
how are you ladies doing this evening?
what do you drive?
I am sorry?
what kind of car do you drive?
oh... a cavalier.
is she looking at me, baby?
no.
now?
no.
is she looking now?
no! she is not looking at you. she has not looked at you once. will you stop asking if... wait, she just looked.
see, baby?
how you guys doing?
it is on.
which one?
minnie pearl.
what are you doing?
what?
you looked right at her, baby.
she did not notice.
yes she did.
damn. now i gotta go in early.
I am sorry.
do not sweat it, baby. this one's a lay-up.
how is it going for you two?
not well.
rejected?
was i money?
i do not know. it was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
why, baby? what did i do wrong?
you asked her for her number, and then you tore it up.
she did not see.
that does not matter.
that was pretty cold, dude.
what was cold about it?
big butt... you know, can not fly coach.
i can not believe you.
they are out of glenlivet.
what else is going on?
i know what you are saying, man. i do not know what to tell you...
...i mean, does it have to be "goofy"? i was playing hamlet off-broadway two months ago, for crying out loud...
it is on.
you think?
baby, i know it is. it is a black diamond trail...
...double diamond...
...but it is worth the risk. true or false: it is worth the risk.
true.
you like laughing at the misery of others?
I am sorry, i could not help it. let me make it up to you.
thanks.
I have seen you somewhere... where have i seen you?
you ever go to the kelbo's? on pico?
...maybe...
...monday nights? i host an open mike...
you are a comedian?
yeah.
what is that like?
well, you know, it is tough. a lot of traveling. a lot of hotels... but, you know, it is a dream... and the money's really good. i think i might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in vegas...
i know! starbucks! i served you an espresso at starbucks.
are you sure? maybe...
yes! remember? you asked me for an application? i introduced you to the manager?
oh, yeah... boy, that must have been a while ago.
I would say about two weeks.
probably a little longer than that, but, whatever.
you better pay the man.
well, thank you...?
nikki.
thank you, nikki.
we got the digits, baby.
what a surprise.
what is wrong? i saw you talking to that beautiful blonde baby.
she was cute.
she did not like me... i made a fool of myself...
baby, do not talk that way, baby...
you are so money, and you do not even know it...
that is what i keep trying to tell him.  you are so money, you do not even know...
please, do not mess with me right now...
we are not messing with you...
...we're not...
you are like this big bear with claws and fangs...
...and big fuckin' teeth...
...and teeth... and she is like this little bunny cowering in the corner...
...shivering...
...and you are just looking at your claws like "how do i kill this bunny?"...
...you're just poking at it...
...yeah. you are just gently batting it around... and the rabbit's all scared...
...and you got big claws and fangs...
...and fangs... and you are like "i do not know what to do. how do i kill this bunny?"...
...you're like a big bear.
you are not just, like, fucking with me?
no, baby!
...honestly...
...you're money...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
now go over there and get those digits.
you are money.
now when you talk to her, i do not want you to be the guy in the pg-13 movie that everyone's pulling for. i want you to be the guy in the rated r movie who you are not sure if you like.
how long do i wait to call?
a day.
tomorrow?
no...
...tomorrow, then a day.
...yeah.
so, two days?
yeah. i guess you could call it that.
definitely. two days. that is the industry standard...
...i used to wait two days. now everyone waits two days. three days is kinda money now, do not you think?
...yeah. but two's enough not to look anxious...
yeah, but three days is kinda the money...
why do not i just wait three weeks and tell her i was cleaning out my wallet and found her number...
...then ask where you met her...
yeah, I will tell her i do not remember and then I will ask what she looks like.  then I will ask if we fucked. how is that, tee? is that "the money"?
laugh all you want, but if you call to soon you can scare off a nice baby who is ready to party.
do not listen to him. you call whenever it feels right to you.
what the fuck..?
what an asshole. did not you see "boys in the hood"? now one of us is going to get shot.
he is a bitch. he am not going to do nothing.
you asshole.
you dick.
what did you want me to do? back down? he called me a bitch. we kept our rep.
you asshole. why are you carrying a gun? what? in case someone steps to you, snoop dogg?
hey, man, you are not from here. you do not know how it is. i grew up in l.a...
...anaheim...
...whatever. things are different here. it is not like new york, mikey.
yeah. here it is easier to avoid trouble. it is not like you like in compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. nobody's mugging you on no subway. in new york the trouble finds you. out here you got to go look for it...
...people get carjacked...
...oh, who would jack your fuckin k- car? he is right, sue. you do not need no gat.
listen. just because i was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
...oh yeah, like "cypress hill" was gonna do anything...
you live in such a fantasy world...
what about you, mikey? at least i got balls. you are always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
...it was six months, and she did not dump...
...whatever. you are like a whining little woman. big deal. you got a fuckin' number. whoopee! you will fuck it up...
...sue...
have you gotten laid once since you moved here? did you fuck once?
...shut up, sue...
i know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. you are like a little whiney bitch...
sue!
do not do it, mike.
shut up.
hi. this is nikki. leave a message.
hi, nikki. this is mike. i met you tonight at the dresden. i, uh, just called to say i, uh, I am really glad we met and you should give me a call. so call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. my number is 213- 555-4679...
hi. this is nikki. leave a message.
hi, nikki. this is mike, again. i just called because it sounded like your machine might have cut me off before i gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when i left the dresden, so i knew I would get your machine. anyway, my number is...
hi. this is nikki. leave a message.
213-555-4679. that is all. i just wanted to leave my number. i do not want you to think I am weird, or desperate or something...  ...i mean, you know, we should just hang out. that is it. no expectations. just, you know, hang out. bye.
hi. this is nikki. leaves a message.
i just got out of a six-year relationship. okay? that should help to explain why I am acting so weird. it is not you. it is me. i just wanted to say that. sorry.  this is mike.
hi. this is nikki. leave a message.
hi, nikki. this is mike again. could you just call me when you get in? I will be up for awhile, and I would just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all...
hi. this is nikki. leave a message.
hi, nikki. mike. i do not think this is working out. i think you are great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. it is not you, really. it is me. it is only been six months...
mike?
nikki! great! did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
do not call me ever again.
wow, i guess you were home...
thanks, man.
no problem, buddy. you eat anything today?
you have not been drinking, have you?
no. just o.j.
sorry about what happened at the dresden. i had no idea...
do not sweat it. now i got an l.a. gun story. you should hear the way i tell to the guys back home. he had an uzi. mike half-smiles.
you want to talk about it?
what is the point?
it is been two days. you should call that girl nikki...
uuuuugh!
oh boy.
I am such an asshole.
she was not your type anyway.
i think I am going to move back east.
well, that is dumb.
what is dumb about it?
well, you are doing so well...
how am i doing well? i host an open mike and i played a fuckin' bus driver in a movie. big fuckin' deal. I am with an agency that specializes in fuckin magicians. how good am i doing?
at least you did not get turned down for goofy...
they turned you down?
they went for someone with more theme park experience. i woulda killed for that job.
see, it is all how you look at it. if your life sucks, then mine is god awful. i mean, i moved out here partially because i saw how well you were doing. you got in the union, you got an agent. i thought if you could make it, maybe i could too...
i did not make it...
that is your problem, man. you can not see what you have got, only what you have lost. those guys are right. you are "money".
then why will not she call...?
because you left, man. she is got her own world to deal with in new york. she was a sweet girl but fuck her. you got to move on. you got to let go of the past. the future is so beautiful. every day is so sunny out here. it is like manifest destiny man. i mean, we made it. what is past is prologue. that which does not kill us makes us stronger. all that shit. you will get over it.
how did you get over it? i mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
sometimes is still hurts. you know how it is, man. i mean, each day you think about it less and less. and then one day you wake up and you do not think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. it is kinda weird. you miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. and the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
you miss the pain?
...for the same reason you miss her. you lived with it so long.
wow.  you wanna grab a bite?
sure.
by the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
you always know the right thing to say.
I am so sorry, man. you were so right. i got rid of the gun
what are they doing here?
we ran into them that night at roscoe's. tee cleared it up, i apologized, bought them some chicken and waffles. they fuckin love tee. that boy can talk.
but most important, man, I am sorry about what i said. i was drunk... my adrenaline was going...
do not sweat it, man. i needed a kick in the ass. we are better friends for it.
thanks, man.  I have been hating myself for the last two days.
believe me, i know what that is like.  yo, double down! what time are we leaving?
hi.
hi.
I am mike.
hi, mike. I am lorraine.
like the quiche?
yes. like the quiche.
i like quiche.
i thought real men do not like quiche.
my reputation seems to have preceded me.
why? you are not a real man?
not lately.
it is on...
...it's on.
...so i thought, what the hell, they make movies in l.a., not in michigan, so i moved here.
just like that?
well, it was not the simple, but yeah.
how was it hard?
well, i left someone very special behind.
tell me about it...
you too?
yeah.
i thought i was going to die.
it is been six months and I am just starting to get over it.
oh, god. that is two more than me. tell me it gets better.
it does.
how?
well, it still sucks, but you start to see that there are advantages to being single.
like what?
what what? what advantages?
you said there are advantages to being single. i want to know what the advantages are.
well... you can talk to a beautiful woman at a bar without worrying if anyone's watching you.
it is on.
...it's definitely on.
what else?
what else...? let's see... you have complete freedom.
to do what?
i do not know... to grow, to go out. whatever you want.
anything?
anything.
like if i meet a handsome young man and i wanted to ask him to dance? i can do that?
uh, if the guy wants to.
you do not think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
yes. i mean, no. i mean, maybe he would find her, i mean you attractive. maybe he does not like to dance. maybe all he likes to do is just stand around and drink and smoke and look cool with his buddies who do not dance either...
maybe it does not matter if he is a good dancer cause it is a slow song, if that is what he is afraid of.
no... maybe that is not the case. maybe she should not be such a smug little shit because she would be surprised at what a good dancer he really is, but it is been a long time and he does not know if he is ready to...
mike...
it is on.
...it is so on.
well... this is it.
listen. i had a great time.
me too.
i would love to see you again sometime.
I will be around.
that is not good enough. i want to make plans to see you.
let me get a pen out of my car.  do you have something to write on?
you are a comedian?
yeah. and an actor.
I will have to come see you sometime.
if and when i get a real gig I will call you.
it is not going to well?
when i lived in new york they made it sound like they were giving out sit-coms to stand-ups at the airport. i got off the plane in l.a. six months ago and all i got to show for it is a tan.
did not you tell me to be patient with my career?
...yeah, but entertainment law is not something you just jump into...
neither is acting. not if you are serious about it.  can i have one of these?
why, you like the duck with the cigar?
yeah. nice touch. it is the logo from "you bet your life", right?
good eye. not one club owner got it. they all ask me why i got donald duck on my card.
hey, at least it is not goofy.
well, i should be getting...
...it's really getting late.
...home. it is getting late. yeah.
can i give you a ride to your car...?
...nah. I am right across the street...
...which one...?
...the red piece of shit over there...
...well, it suits you...
...get the hell outta here already...
you were off your ass back there! where the hell did you learn to do all that twirly whirly shit?
i took a ballroom class with michelle. i never danced with anyone but her, til tonight. that lorraine chick is good.
you were good. did you see how she was vibing you?
sorry man.
yeah. you probably coulda hit that tonight if you did not have to drive us home.
...definitely...
it is not like that...
do not give me that! she liked you, man.
i know she liked me. i mean, it is not like i wanted to do anything with her tonight.
good for you, man. he is being smart.
she is really special, guys.
the bear's got his claws back.
be smart about it.
I am telling you. wait three days...
you do not have to wait three days...
...okay, two...
...just be smart about it.
guys... guys... i got it under control.
oh. he is got it under control...
...well, then, i guess we do not have to worry about him anymore.
our little baby's growing up...
how is it going? it is been a while...
...six months.
how are you doing?
fine... i guess. you?
good.  i think about things.
yeah?
yeah.
what kind of things?
you know, us.
i thought you met someone else.
it does not matter. i think about you every day.
really?
i miss you, mike.
why did not you call?
i couldn't. do you know how hard it is been not to call you? i pick up the phone every night. whenever that commercial comes on...
...the michelin commercial...
...yeah, with the baby in the tire. one time i started to cry right in front of pierre...
pierre... that is his name? pierre? is he french?
no, he is not... listen i do not want to talk about him. that is a whole other headache. i called because i heard you might be moving back to queens...
hello?
hi, mike?
lorraine?
are you on the other line?
yeah, hold on.
i can call back...
no, no. hold on.
hi.
i heard you might be moving back...
yeah, uh, i do not think that is going to be happening any time soon... listen, can i call you right back? i got to take this call...
I am not home and going out of town tomorrow for a week. can not you talk for five more minutes?
i really want to catch up with you, but I have got to take this call. they are holding. I will talk with you when you get back in town. bye.
goodbye. i lov...
hi. sorry about that.
you did not have to get off the other line. i would have called you back.
that is okay. i wanted to talk to you.
do you realize that I have been waiting for that call for six months and i cut her off?
you are money, baby.
hi, lorraine. thanks for holding on.
listen, mike. you really did not have to get off the line. i just wanted to ask you one thing. i know i should not have called, i mean, my friends said i should wait two days... oh god, i probably sound like such a schoolgirl... it is just that it is tonight only... i mean, it is sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "the room". do you know where that is? it is impossible to find if you have never been there. i do not understand why none of the clubs in hollywood have signs. anyway, I am so bad at this, if you are not busy i thought you might...
