can you get me on a flight thursday night?
we are looking into it bob, but they really want you to stay to do that talk show friday, apparently it is a really big deal, he is the johnny carson of japan.
yeah, they told me.
these people are paying you a lot, do you think you could consider it?
just get me out of here as soon as you can.
ok, you are scheduled to leave saturday, but we will hold a seat thursday in case, but first class is full, you are waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on lufthansa...
oh, great. I will talk to you later, bye.
what are you doing here?
my wife needs space, i do not know my kids ' birthdays.  everyone wants tiger woods, but they could get me, so I am here doing a whiskey commercial.
what about you? why are you here?
my husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and i just came along...i'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
how long have you been married?
two years.
try twenty-five.
you are probably just having a mid- life crisis. did you buy a porche?
I am thinking about it.
25 years... that is a long time... are you still in love with your wife?
yes... i do not know, i do not know her anymore. i do not know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. i was... actually i was in love with her sister first, when i was twenty-one. and one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to paris, so i said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to paris with francois,   and she is still married to him. and i moved in with lydia... but i always really liked lydia.
oh.
what do you do?
I am not sure, yet... i graduated last spring.
what did you study?
philosophy.
oh, what do you do with that?
i do not know, but i can think about it, a lot.
it takes a while to figure it out. I am sure you will, though.
thanks. I am sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
thanks.
john! what are you doing here?
I am just here shooting this band, what about you?
promoting that action movie i did...
...doing like twenty million interviews a day... it is soo good to see you. how long are you here for?
we are here for the week. I am shooting in osaka for a few days.
it is amazing  there!
have you met charlotte? my wife.
no!  hi! so great to meet you!
uh..thanks.
sorry if i have the worst b.o., I have been sweating in this little room with t.v. lights for hours...
oh no...
...well, i have the worst  headache, i have to go find some aspirin. but, call me, let's have a drink, I am under evelyn waugh.
evelyn waugh?
what?
evelyn waugh was a man.
its just a pseudonym, it does not matter.
why do you have to defend her?
I am not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
no, i thought it was funny. forget it.
how did it go today?
good...i'm tired.
i gotta go meet kelly for a drink downstairs. she wants to talk about some photo thing.
ok. maybe I will walk down with you.
you wanna come?
sure.
ok.
hi again, how is it going?
who do i have to fuck to get off this planet?
no, what are you talking about.
i went to a temple today and i did not feel anything.
that is ok.
i do not know what to do.
that is ok, you will figure it out.
you smell weird.
what?
like popcorn?
i got some hair stuff.
hair stuff?
i gotta go to work.
see you later.
bye.
lauren?
charlotte?! how is tokyo?
it is cool... but,i do not know... i went to a shrine today and all these little monk's were chanting... and, i did not feel anything... i even tried ikebana, ...   and john's using hair products... i do not know who i.
oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?
sure.
oh, it is nothing... i better go, I will talk to you later.
ok, have fun there, you are so lucky you do not have any kids yet and you can go off to japan... call me when you get back.
ok, bye.
yeah.
yeah, i think you are probably right... because when you try to...
do you think it is done?
i do not know.
will you please stop smoking?
but i like to... and i do not smoke that much.
its bad for you.
ok, i will... later.
a soul's search: finding your true character and calling? is this yours?
oh... that is nothing, someone gave it to me.
you do not have to be embarrassed.
I am not. it is just corny, but I am not into it.
it is ok if you are.
oh, the record company sent these...
mmm, i love cristal, let's have some.
i got to go... and i do not really like champagne.
are you sure you want to stay?
are you sure you have to go?
yeah, i know you have to work the whole time, I will probably have more fun here. I will call charlie and those guys.
ok, definitely call them, I will be back friday. i love you.
i miss you.
it will just be a few days.
oh, hi.
hi. did you have a nice swim?
yeah. did you get some sleep?
no, how about you?
not really. how long are you here for?
I am here for the week.
oh, good. do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
ok.
see you later.
you really are having a mid-life crisis.
i know, it is stupid.
a soul's search: finding your true calling - are you reading this?
no.
charlie, this is bob. bob  charlie brown.
hi, charlie.
what do you feel like singing, bob?
no way.
i could cut the ones that are left for you.
ok.
i do not want to go home.
i know. i do not either.
lydia?
hello, darling.
lydia, i went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
oh, yeah? i wish i had seen it.
he was this fashion guy, and there were all these japanese fashion people- it is a whole other world, and i was talking to these japanese surfers... he was playing all this great music- i have to find out what it was...
that sounds great  can you hold on...  what zoe?
yeah, its really different here.
well, that is good, i have to get the kids off for school.  can i call you in a little while?
it is four in the morning... I am going to go to sleep.
ok, well... i love you.
i love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
good-night.
hello?
it is charlotte.
charlotte, who?
thanks for getting me back in one piece.
of course.
do you want to have some breakfast?
yeah, I am going to take a shower and I will meet you downstairs.
ok, see you downstairs.
hey look, it is sausalito.
i see them every morning.
hans was very attentive to you.
i think he kind of liked me...is that so hard to imagine?
no, its easy.
how did a japanese guy get a name like hans?
i do not know.
do you remember when we met at the bar? ...you were wearing a tuxedo.
but the first time i saw you was in the elevator.
really?
yeah, you do not remember?
did i scowl at you?
no, you smiled.
i do not remember.
i know, i kind of blend in here.
why do they switch the r's and l's here?
i do not know. my fax said "have a good fright".
let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
ok, whatever you want.
did you see hiromix last night dancing with bambi?
no, i was looking at you.
oh.  well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird english guy who kept talking about hanging out with the sex pistols on kings road...
i got a fax today from your friend hiromix.
oh, for her show?
no, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
oh.
you are possessive.
i know.
I am stuck. does it get easier.
no, yes, it does...
yeah? but look at you.
thanks. it does, the more you know who you are... you do not care about things the same way...
i just do not know what I am supposed to be. i thought maybe i wanted to be a writer... but i hate what i write, and i tried taking pictures, but john's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
you will figure it out. I am not worried about you. keep writing.
but, I am mean.
that is ok.
and marriage, does that get easier?
it is hard. we started going to a marriage counselor.
did that help? did you learn anything?
we established that we have no communication.
oh.
we used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she is tired of it all. she never wants to leave the kids, she does not need me, and they do not need me, i feel like I am in the way. it gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
that is too scary.
when they are born its like vietnam. it is terrifying.
no one ever tells you that...
but, it is great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
that is nice. my parents were always traveling, they were not around so much.
where did you grow up?
in d.c., my dad was the ambassador to france in the eighties, so we went to school in paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in d.c., and they were never around... and then i moved to los angeles when john and i got married... it is so different there.
i know.
john thinks I am so snotty.
you are.
i know, but that is what you like about me.
why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
because that would be too easy.
hello?
mr. harris, we have fax for you!
ok.
do you want i send it to your room?
great.
thank you, mr. harris.
you made it.
they really have to work on that street name thing.
it is for my daughter.
how old is she?
four.
oh, she will love it.
nice one.
fuck off.
what happened to your toe?
i do not know, i think maybe i broke it? i knocked into something the other day...
it is bad is not it?
we should get you to the doctor.
you think so?
yeah, look at that thing.
how do you say "hospital" in japanese?
excuse me?
hospital?
one moment, please.
hello?
bob, it is me.
oh, hi, elaine.
so, we got you on an earlier flight, but i really think you should think about staying for that talk show.
ok.
you will do it?
yeah, I will stay.
hello?
bob?
hi, lydia.
is this a bad time?
uh, no.
it is really hard to reach you... did you get the carpet samples? i like the burgundy.
ok, whatever you think... I am lost.
it is just carpet.
that is not what I am talking about.
what are you talking about?
i do not know.
is there anything i can do?
i do not know... i want to be more healthy. i want to eat better.
what?
you know, eat healthier.
alright?
not all that pasta.
fine.
like japanese food.
why do not you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
oh, come on.
i have to go, adam's tormenting zoe, I will talk to you later. are you going to be ok?
yeah, I will be fine. bye.
where is your husband?
working.
do you ever see him?
yeah.
do you know where we are?
no.
I am going to daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
yes, but no, i can not right now.
oh, i guess you are busy, huh.
i do not want to be.
hello?
hello, bob, it is me.
hello?
it is lydia, your wife.
i could not hear you. how are you?
fine. is it going ok?
it is ok.
do you want to-
what?
do you want to talk to  zoe?
yeah.
zoe, come say hello to your father...
i guess she is busy.
that is ok.
when are you coming home?
tomorrow.
her ballet recital is saturday, do not forget.
ok.
ok, well, travel safely. see you soon.
bye.
you can not get sushi anywhere in japan after 2 o'clock. did you know that?
no, we will find something around here.
well, i guess she is more around your age...  you guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
you are a brat, was not there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
what do you want to drink?
a coke.
so, where did you go today.
around.
I am sorry.
that lunch was the worst, huh.
when are you leaving?
tomorrow.
I am going to miss you.
that is what you said the other night.
well, i mean it more now.
i do not want to go back tomorrow.
i know. but, it does not last, you have to go back sometime.
why can not it last?
i do not know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can not stay here forever, unless maybe we started a jazz band.
hello? yes?
hello, can i have room 5601.
one moment.
charlotte?
hi, bob.
I am just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
uh, yeah... I will bring it down.
that would be great.
just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
yes, no.
you are leaving right now?
yes.
well... have a good flight.
thanks.
ok, bye.
why are you crying?
I will miss you.
