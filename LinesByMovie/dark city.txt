good evening, sir.
yes.  this way.
why are you wearing that thing on your face?
germs, sir.  these places are full of them.
i see.  one thingís for sure, heís ambitious. youíll be a busy man from now on.
what about thompson, sir?  wasnít this his case?
thompson suffered a kind of severe delusion or some damn thing.  anyway he isnít with us any longer.  the case is yours.  go through his files. take what you need.  by the way, howís your mother?
sheís getting better, thanks.  she...
dammit!
sorry, sir.
donít ever sneak up on me like that! who are you?
patricia crenshaw.
iím your new assistant.
i didnít requisition a secretary.
the chief-inspector thought you might need a hand.
iíve taken the liberty and had inspector thompsonís office searched, as i believe you instructed.  all clear now, sir.  they found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... poor man.
good.
you wonít regret this, sir.
fine.
you typed this report?
yes, sir.  anything wrong?
wrong?  look at this!
it seems fine.
<u>fine</u>?  look here!
how can i submit this?
iím sorry...
do you wash your hands before you type things?
why, yes.
well be more careful, please.
why do you want to speak to him?
a hunch.  he might be able to...
itís extremely important to my investigation...
iíll be the judge of that.  anything else?
actually, i was wondering, sir, if you could let me have a few uniforms, to follow up for me...
lost something?
what makes you think that!  if you would learn to concentrate on facts, not get so side-tracked  -  you might get things done faster, bumstead...
i need something to keep me awake.
looks like you need a haircut to me.
thanks.  just some pills.
only two bucks.  shave as well...
sell maps?
what of?
the city.  i need to get to the ocean.
nope.  no maps.  ocean, huh?  on vacation?
mnunn.  cold lately.  that night, couple weeks ago.  that was <u>real</u> cold.  remember that?
not really...
yeah, iím like that.  senility says the wife.  but she sure canít complain.  heh.  the erector set still works good.  and this ainít no fucking rug! gíhead.  feel it!  all mine!
no.  i, ah...
you seem restless.
someoneís after me.
then we must call the police.
no.  i mean...  that isnít necessary.
i see.  then who is after you?  what sins have you committed?
just let me sit here for a moment? iíll go soon, and stop bothering you.
donít kill me!
shut up!
please...
how long have you been here?
maybe ten minutes...  thatís strange.
spinning backwards?
you remember nothing?  who you are? what you've done?
you know something about me?
ah, that would be cheating, wouldn't it?  is there nothing <u>you</u> remember?  not even a detail?   you must try.
you think i haven't been trying!  it's like there was never anything there.  just water.
water?
waves...  a beach.  a woman whispering.  that's all.  i need to stay awake.  do you have any pills?
what does she say?  the woman.
asks my name.  over and over.  just like a broken record.  only thing is, i can't answer.  i've no idea what my name <u>is</u>.
your name is john white.
that's what people keep telling me.
bad dreams?
yes.
tell me about them...
if you like.
you're supposed to be my doctor, right?
that's right.  i <u>am</u> your doctor.
known me for long?
well...
i cannot say...  you don't know the answer to that?
i told you, i can't remember a thing!
did she drown?  the woman you told me about?
not exactly.  she was found in a canal, disembowelled.  throat cut. blood drained.  the body wrapped in a bed-sheet.
horrible...
you remember nothing, eh?  let me show you something.
we are little more than a sum of memories.  from them we reference who we are, where we're going.  without a past we are nothing.  this is why you are so interesting.
i'm nothing then.
anything <u>but</u>, my friend.
can i get my life back?
maybe.
i'm sorry.  about before.
i don't blame you for getting angry. you are in a frustrating situation. you must be patient though.  trust me completely.  i'm here to help.
what are you doing?
i have to go...
you can't go yet.  we've got so much to talk about...
police.  nobody move.
he tried to kill me!
shut up!  everybody stay calm...
where are we going?
shut-up.
what's he doing here?
says he is the man's doctor...  you know...
i <u>know</u> it's his doctor...  i need the file on..  daniel paul schreber m.d.
you're a liar!
no, it's the truth.
so you're telling me the truth <u>this</u> time?  is that it!
if you would only take this, inject it in your brain, everything would be much clearer.
not that again...
everyone get's one  -  very much like this...  but this one's special.  it will help you understand, everything...
you've been working too hard.
please!  don't be foolish!  time is short.  let me show you something. look at this syringe.
why?
don't ask stupid questions.  look at it.
it's a trick.
no it isn't.  <u>you</u> are doing it!  now raise it over the glass and...
doctor!  what brings you here?
just visiting my patient.
really?  and how is his state of mind?
he's seriously disturbed...
you seem a little edgy.  everything okay?
yes, of course.  everything's fine...
to tell you the truth, i'm glad we've run into each other like this.  maybe you can help me tidy some loose ends.
loose ends?
yes.  that's right.  he's ill  -  he needs expert help.
i see...
yes, sir.  i'm sorry...  but i don't understand how it was possible.  the only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
how could you have been so stupid?
bumstead, you're starting to annoy me.  this case is very important to me.  just a little warning:  i've got my eye on you inspector, remember that.
yes, sir.
i thought it would make more sense. i'm getting the pieces, but when i put it together it feels like... like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
it's the truth...  i need you.  i know you're innocent.
how do you know i'm innocent?
of course you are.  you couldn't do those terrible things.  come home with me  -  maybe things will make sense then...
i can't do that.  it's dangerous. what about my parents?  do you know where i can find them?
they're dead, john.
how do i get there?  tell me.
that's easy.  you...
can't let you in...  sorry.
i'm on the serial killer case, need to talk.
not that.  anything else.
they've taken my mind, my memories...
what?  who has?
is that your idea of a joke?  i don't remember...  take my advice, bumstead.  get off this case.  now.
what is going on?
jesus!  we have to get you to a doctor...
no...  no doctor...
but...  how long has this been happening?
a few days...  a few weeks  -  dunno, i can't remember.  worse thing is, i never know if it will change back again...  now, please leave me alone.
all the same entry wounds.  it's definitely him.  she lives...  lived here.  a prostitute.
the other one?
his wife.
jesus.  small world.  where's the photographer?
no one available.
they don't speak english...
how will we interrogate them?
well, sir...  i don't know exactly.
who is it?
won't say.  says he must talk to you.
put it through...
i need everything on the jonathan white case.
yes, sir.  <u>everything</u>?
all the important stuff.  wrap it up for me.
why give yourself up?
i  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  i thought maybe you know something...  i'm scared.
that was a pretty good escape act at the station.  how did you do that?
i woke up in a subway.  i don't know how i got there.
people...  after me.
who?
i don't know who they are.
why are they after you?
don't know that either.
don't know much, do you?
they didn't have faces.
what?
that's right.  just seamless flesh across the front of their heads.  no mistake.  i just hadn't remembered it that way.  up until then they had been normal little girls in my memory.  that's not all.  once i started examining them, all sorts of things about my life, had... inconsistencies.  it was like a game. i would think about a person or a place, or an event.  then i would turn the lights off.  sit down in a comfortable chair...  and study each detail of this subject.
go on.
well.  the only thing i've been certain of, all this time, is that i need to get to the ocean.  the point is no one seems to know how to get there.
why, that's ridiculous.  you just...
i met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  tall fellow.  no hair.  rather pale skin...
i don't know what you're talking about.
that's surprising.  he was leaving your office at the time...
you are mistaken.
what are you hiding?
nothing.  i don't know anything!
please, they'll kill me...
i think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
in there.
just like that?
what is this place?
you wouldn't believe me if i told you, inspector.  have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
where do you think this goes?
it sure isn't the fun-fair.
was that for real down there?
i'm afraid so.
what now?
this ocean business...  i know where i can find a map.  i need to go back to the station.  where will you be?
look!  this is a good one!
what is that door?
which one?
there.  behind the cabinet.  where does it go?
such a joker!  like your father.
no.  have a look.
you see it?
yes.
where does it lead?
it must be a closet or something.
what happened to you?
i'm...  being...  punished.
what is it?
we are...  living in their dreams...
a fanciful idea, mister white.
everyone has a job  -  a function.  each one teaches you more about your invention.  i'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.
a book of delusions.  anything else?
but i...
i see.  the verdict, yes...
wait, this isn't fair...
i didn't realise...
shut up, freak!  monster!  you are insignificant.
