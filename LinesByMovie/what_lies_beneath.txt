I am just saying, you are going to be fine.

genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.

if you have to work...
no, no.  I am just about...  there.
how are you?
fine.
it is okay if you are not.
i am, really.
it is just she is been the focus for a while.
not the focus.
you know what i mean.
to tell you the truth...i'm excited.
you are...
to get my life back.  to have some time for myself.  some time for us.
you did a great job.  she is a good kid.
we did.
it is just us now.
i know.
tired?
nope.

I am finished at three.  no.  squash with stan.

I will be there.

it is mrs...it's claire...spencer.  from next door.  is everything--
you are the flower lady.
um...yes.
I have seen you.  from the window.
is everything alright?
hello?
I am not...
he is so...it's too much...and i can't...i can not breath...
who?  your husband?
and I am afraid.  oh god, I am so afraid of...
what?  what are you afraid of?
i can't, no, no, i can't...
tell me.  please.
that I will just...that one day I will just...disappear.
tell me.  i can help you.
how?  how can you help me?  with your flowers and your perfect life...
that is not...it's not like that.
I have never even met you.
i know.  and I am sorry.  I have been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
this fence...it's so...
I am sorry.  it is for the flowers.  why do not you...
oh god.  he is back.  I am sorry.  please forget that i...i do not know what I am saying.  please...
wait!  do not go...
of what?
of him i think.
did she say that?
more or less.
honey, they are young.  they are probably newlyweds.
I am telling you.  there was something in her voice...
remember how we were?
not like this.  we were never like this.  i want to go over there.  after dinner, we can--
why?
to make sure she is all right.
claire, honey, we are not going to march next door and accuse our new neighbor of--
that is not what I am sug--
...when tonight they will probably be keeping us awake.
but what if something happens?
claire...
I would never be able to live with mysel--
nothing's going to happen.  besides, i have to work tonight.  the conference is in less than two weeks. I have got to stay focused on that for just a little longer.  this is...
i know.
it is what I have been working for.
i just wish you could have heard her.
look, I will call harvey tomes in the psych department, see what i can find out.
promise?
norman, you have to look at this!
mmnph.
hurry...
nothing.  there was...i thought i saw something.
is it gone?
how you holding up?
good.  I am good.
you are?
why does everyone find that so surprising?
cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I would be tripping...
okay, I am a little tender.
well good.  so you are human.
and so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
wow.  got here just in time.  i brought you this.
what is it?
kambucha mushroom tea...
jody--
it soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness.  sela suggested i bring--
you are discussing me with your psychic?
she is not a psychic.  just a very enlightened spirit.
thanks, but I am fine.
so you will have some later.  notice anything...different?
oh my god.  you bought it.
yep.
it is niiice.
beautiful thing, alimony.  lose a husband, get a car.  think it will help me pick up dudes?
absolutely.
listen, I have got to run.  i just thought I would stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say thursday morning?
you got it.
hi.
I am stuck here for another couple of hours.
oh.
unless you need me to come home...
no, no.  it is fine.
claire?
huh?  absolutely.  take your time.
what are you doing here?
there were some noises.  i did not want to disturb you.
what do you mean?  some noises where?
in the house.  i was scared.
did you call the police?
no.  can you drive me home?  I will bring you back in the morning.
of course.
it was there.  this angry music all by itself.  and i heard whispering.
what kind of whispering?
i do not know.  just...whispering.
I have got the conference next week.  i want you to feel safe.
i do, i do.  I am sure I am just...how was your day?
think i may have cracked it.
really?
i think so.  maybe.
you are so brilliant.
yep.
madame curie, jonas salk, norman spencer...
you know what that does to me.
ohmigod.  you will never believe...i saw schumway...
you are kidding.
he is here giving some arcane spiel for the physics department, so bob shine introduces us...
wow.
and he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "doctor spencer, i am a great admirer of your work..."
well, that is nice.
"...especially spencer's theorem..."
oh, no...
"...of perpetual distances."  everybody's checking their shoelaces. pins drop.  "i'm afraid you have mistaken me,"  i say...
that's...
"...for my father."
I am so sorry.
did not know he was dead, every stinking paper on the globe.
that is just mean.  oh.  jody wanted to know if i could get her some.
did you tell her?
what?  no.  no.
you didn't?
norman, you are so funny about that.  no, i didn't.
sorry.  you understand.
did you call about the feurs?
oh, right.  yes.  harvey says the guy's a sweetheart.  would not hurt a fly.
huh.
yes?
um...
I am running late here.  i just came back for my briefcase.
right.  well, i wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood.  I am claire spencer.  from next door.
this really is not a good time.
well maybe your wife...
she is not here.
when...when will she be back?
i do not know.
oh-kay...
i have to go.
you think he killed her?
i do not know.  when you say it, it sounds crazy.  but what else could it all be?
know what i think?
what?
seance.
jody, no...
telling you...
...no...no...no...
just bought this beautiful antique ouija.
please.  that is all i need.
someone is there.
what?
in the window.  norman's at work.
i don't...
wow.  I am losing it.
no, you are not.  but a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
get down!  he will see.
what is going on, claire?
shhhh.
he killed her.
what?
he did.  she is in the picture.  i went over to look and she is gone.  the table was set for one.
and that means he murdered his wife? this is getting ridic--
no, no, no, no.  the soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay.  it is not from here, believe me, i...  all right, look at this.
our house.
no.  look!  in the window.
it is a flare.
a flare?
from the sun.  it is a reflection on the glass.
it is her!  I am telling you.  she whispered and turned on the music.  she is trying to contact me!
it is a ghost.
where is she then?
she could be out.  she could be sick in bed for all we know.
okay.  okay.  I will bet there's...look at this.
see?
what am i looking at?
i did not do that.
who did?  mrs. feur?
maybe.  point is...not me.
right.  and why is she here?  if he killed her, why does not she haunt him?
she was lonely, i talked to her.  norman, i know how it looks, but--
claire, listen to me.  i know you are under some strain.  but there is no such thing as ghosts.  they do not exist.  our neighbor did not kill his wife, and i...wait, why are not you dressed?
dressed?
dinner.  with stan and his new girl.
when?
what do you mean?  claire, we talked about it.  you did not want japanese, i said, our first date since...
oh.
...since caitlin.  you do not remember this?
tonight?
yes, tonight.  we are going to be--
when you do this, i swear...
...don't get all...
...like it never even happened...
okay, okay, I am sure that i just...
what are you doing?
restaurant.  let them know we are running late.
five minutes?
you are not at the center.
i know I am not at the center of the bridge.
we are going to be fine.
there we go.
well, that is a relief.
wow.
this is...
we know each other.
he looked like one of the monkees.
anyway, claire slept with him...
i did not sleep with him.
...just so she could cut them off.
he was so pissed.
i came in from my room...
we were suite mates.
and there is this brilliant conductor in purple briefs with no bangs cursing his ass off in finnish.
oh god...
you should have heard her play.
stop.
we both auditioned for the philharmonic. one cello position open.
do we have to?
and i kicked ass.  my best stuff.  then i stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and i cried.
she is making this up.
I am not.  could not pick up my cello for weeks.
she got it.  turned it down.
i met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
i do not need a shrink.
harvey says he is amazing.
norman...
what can it hurt to talk to someone?
claire, she is been a huge part of your life for seventeen years.  if you were not thrown off balance by this, then something would be wrong.
i never said i was not upset.  of course I am upset.  i miss her terribly.  but i know what i saw and what i heard...and it was not some "symptom" of something...
i never said...
...and i do not think I am some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
are you lonely?
no!  and i do not need a psychiatrist!
who is idea was it?
mine.  his.  we both...thought...
i did not want to come.
then why did you?
because he was worried about me.
your husband?
yes.  I am sure he is hoping you will pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
do you really think so?
no.
why is he worried?
because, i do not know, because sometimes...sometimes i forget things...and ever since caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...i fainted and...  why is this so hard?
fireball?
you are joking.
these are good.
mm-hmm.
she finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. angry rock and roll.
how do you know it is a she?
i saw her in the water.  beside me.  she was filling the bathtub.
what does she look like?
pretty.  she is a blond.
do you have any idea who she is?
um...i'd rather not say...just yet.
fine.
what do you think i should do?
what?
try to communicate with her somehow.
you think that will help?
can not hurt.  and i think it is important you find out what she wants.
are you humoring me?
nope.
how?
i do not know.  my aunt used to use my uncle's old pajamas and a candle.
sit down here.
are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
place your fingers on the planchette.
the planchette?
this.
we wish to commune with the spirit of mrs. feur.  what is her first name?
i do not know.
nothing's happening.
shhh.
oh...
m-e...
mef?  what is mef?
it is initials.  f is feur.  it is her.
i have to go.
jody, wait.
what are you doing out here?
he killed her.  I am not crazy.  he killed her and--
this is the feur thing?
yes.  and he is going to get away with it.
how do you know this?
we had a seance.
who did?
jody and i.  and she was there, norman, she was.  it scared jody so bad she had to leave.
how did you--
jody brought a ouija board and we summoned her.
what?
maybe you resent how busy I have been.
what are you...?  no.
you know what I have got at stake with this paper.  you know that.  i can not help but think that you are doing this now to hurt me, or to sabotage me somehow.
sabotage?
ever since the accident I have been worried that you would been unhappy, or...
the accident...?
but then you have been so much better...
norman, this is not about you.  this is something that is happening to me.  it is not to get even...and it is not some warped bid for attention.  some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
sweetheart--
no!  not sweetheart, no.  i believe in what is happening.  i do not want to, but i do.  i guess i was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
keep your voice down.
i will not.
maybe you are right.  maybe I am losing my mind...
claire, please...
who?
give me that shit.  your wife.
i did not kill my wife.
I am sorry...
then where is she?
what is happening to me?
well, that is what we are here for.
whether you imagined it or not, you actually saw and heard things that frightened you...that gave you reason for concern.
yes, but...
your friend saw them.
is not there something called group hysteria?
you think you influenced her?
maybe.  i do not know.  i just know that when all this was happening, i felt, some part of me felt...alive.  like somebody needed me.  and the more i reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
you are saying you willed these events to happen?
i do not know, I am very confused right now.
she said, "you know."  that i know.
do you?
no.
what do you think?  guess.
i felt...pain.  that she would been hurt by someone.  this is great.  I am trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
have you been hurt?
me?  no.  well, in the accident i was injured, but...
you were in an accident?
last year.  i drove my car up a tree. nothing serious, this...  ...a minor concussion.  but the car looked bad.  it could have been bad.  i think it scared the hell out of norman.
what?
that he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that i'm...that's something is wrong...with me.
that can not feel good.
no, it doesn't...okay, look, i see what you are doing here, and that's, I am sorry, but that is not it.  my marriage is fine. I have had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where i saw some things that were not there.  let's deal with that.  I am willing to deal with that.  i just do not want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
i wanted to apologize.
you do?
for scaring you like i did.  when i thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
and then you were not there.
right.  I am sorry.
would you like some iced tea?
very much.
your house is so beautiful.
thank you.
and these roses.  they are much prettier up close.
no.
of what?  what were you so afraid of?
you are going to think I am crazy or something.
love.
what?
have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you could not breathe?  that the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
um...sure.
i could not catch my breath.  that is not a metaphor, that's...and i panicked.  i never dreamed anyone would hear me back there...  i tried to leave him.  went to my mother's in boston.  he brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
you must think I am pathetic.
no.  no, i don't.
I am sorry that i frightened you like that.  but i was so touched by your concern.  I have been lonely here.  perhaps we could be friends.
...i'm pulling up, yuri.  I will see you for dinner.  sure you will not stay?
no, it is fine.  I am fine.
really big bed.
do i have everything?
yep.
call ya later.
what?
are you glad?  I am glad.
you know i am.
good.  you sat in front...i saw you there...
you were lost in the music...eyes closed...your chest heaving...
i felt you...looking through me...
we walked all night...
you told me that i was...
that was very good.
mom, I am sorry.  i wanted to tell you. but it never felt right.
why?
besides, dad would have freaked.
no, he wouldn't.
i think playing in a band called "bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
that is not true.
yes it is.  can we please not do that? please?  cause it is.
he loves you very much.  he just--
i know he does.
are you mad at me?
listen to me.  the one thing in life that i definitely do not regret...is the choice. i made to be your mother.
i miss you.
so much.
it got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
what do you mean?
i started seeing things.
a ghost?
did you?
no.  but once i heard...
what?
someone crying.  a girl.  i thought i was crazy.
then we both are.
of course.  you must be so proud.
i am.
everyone's very anxious to shake hands with our newest academic celebrity.
are you okay?
i think so
I am sorry for leaving, but i mean, jesus, claire...
it is alright.
i mess around with this stuff, but i never thought anything would happen.
does norman know?
jody, she is alive.
what?
mrs. feur.  she is alive.  i met her. she is really sweet.
then what was it?
nothing.  it was not anything.  I have been on edge lately.  maybe since the accident. and I would prefer, i really would, to just--
something was there.  you saw it.
did i?
yes.  now i talked to sela and there is a guy, this pakistani guy down in hartford...
hartford?
and he is the real thing.  specializes in cases like this, like yours.
no.  jody, listen to me.  you have to listen to me.  this is not something that i can do right now.  whatever it was, it is gone.  i need it to be gone now.
but claire--
please.
okay.  okay.
I have got to find a bathroom.  I will call you.
how're you holding up?
just fine.  it is a lovely party.
norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.
almost.
wonderful.  it is good to see you two doing so well.
I am sorry?
i know how hard it can be sometimes.
uh-huh.  what can be?
well, i do not think I have seen you since the reception at dean ackerman's last year.
for the dupont chair.  i swear.  I am becoming the nosy old lady i used to run from at amherst.
no.  I am just not sure what you mean.
there was just...some tension.  you were upset.  i remember being concerned.
at the party.
toward the end.  you remember?
ohhh yes.  no, no.  just a little, you know...we're fine.
well, I am glad.  pardon my intrusiveness, but we do have to stick together you know.
who is that?
the wives.
you do not remember?
when she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
you dropped a glass.
i...
a cheap wine glass from the caterers.  you started crying.  i tried to comfort you...
in the living room...
you shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  i took you home.
but why?  i can not understand how i could just completely--
it was maybe a week after the accident. we were moving.  it was a hard time.
but i do not remember.
sweetheart, it was over a year ago.
what is wrong with me?
i may have seen her on campus.
not personally.
no.  I am afraid to ask what this is about.
it is her.  this is the woman who I have seen.
the...
yes.  the ghost.
i thought it was mrs. feur, but it is not...
stop...
...i'm positive this time...
...please stop...
it is madison fra--
stop it!
mrs. frank?
yeah.
I would like to talk to you about madison.
you know where she is?
no, i don't.
please leave me alone.
what is your name?
claire.
she never mentioned you.
just plain old coffee.  none of that mocha nonsense.
it is fine.
you look a little old for a student.
I am not.  we...we met at a party.
sounds about right.  never understood how a girl that wild got all a's.  sure did not get it from me.  they wanted to put her in a special school for the gifted when she was young.  maddie would not hear about it.
she never mentioned her father.
well she wouldn't.  he left when she was twelve.  never spoke about him after that.
why are you here?
i do not know.
it is like that.  does not seem real.  no note.  nothing.  cops say she will be back.  i just wanna know what happened.
full scholarships.  princeton too.  she wanted to stay close.
you must have been very proud.
they are calling me in to work.
i should be going anyway.
y'hear anything you will let me know?
of course.
what was her major?
biology.  she wanted to be a doctor.
i take it your not mad at me.
would not go that far.
ow!
what is the matter?
it is too rough.
since when?
i do not like this, this...
why do not you shut up and fuck me, professor.
i think she is starting to suspect something.
who?
your wife...
stop it!
"you know..."
what?
i was there.
claire--
i came to work in the garden and i saw you with her...in my house.
oh god...
i snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened.  and when i woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't.  until now.
it was last year.  we were having troubles.
so you fucked a student?!
that is not what I am sayi--
do not touch me.  just get away from me. go!
claire, please don't...
what did you think i would do?  jesus christ!  i gave up my life and my music...
i never asked you to quit!
...oh bullshit.  you had to topple perfect daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
that is not true!  you wanted to quit!  and then when you did, you hated me for it... so you gave it all to her.
who?
to caitlin!!
leave her out of this!
and then out of nowhere, some bright young woman found me attractive...
stop...
...would do anything just to be around me.  and i slipped.  god help me, i slipped.
I am not going to listen to this.
i tried to break it off!
you should have tried harder.
claire...
get out of my way.
she was damaged and unstable.  the more i tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  finally, she showed up at the new house...
how did she know where it was?
she did it.
we do not know that for sure.
of course she did, norman.  what else could it be?
oh god...you knew.
i was down in adamant...
adamant?
artsy little village down seven.  there is a guy there who sells my work.  i had just dropped off some paintings and as i got in my car...i saw norman sitting at this little cafe.
i started to walk over...but he was not alone.  a blond.  i only caught a glimpse. she was young.  i should have said something right away. but i didn't.
why?
partly because i did not want to hurt you...but partly...partly because i was relieved.
relieved?
i had just been left by richard.  i was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life was not as perfect as it seemed.
by the time i finally got up the nerve to tell you, stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
too late?  jody, it was an accident.
alone?  on a two lane road?  with a ton of valium in your system?
i got there first.  stan covered up the pills and i had it out with norman.  he seemed desperate not to lose you.  he promised to handle it.  and we all let it drop away.
all of us.
I am a terrible friend.
no.
how could i expect you to tell me something that i would not even tell myself?
what are you going to do?
i do not know.
if she was dangerous before--
she could have hurt me if she wanted to.
you do not know that.  if it is your belief that gives her form, then you have got to shut her out.  somehow you have to break the connection.
no.  she wanted me to know the truth.  now that i do...i think she is at peace.
jody, she tried to kill him.
i know.
i can not believe this is happening.
we need help.  please let me call the medium.
that could take days.  i need to do something now.  do not you see?  she wants us dead.
alight, alright.  stay calm.  you opened this door.  there is got to be a way that you can close it.
like what?
i have an idea.  but, i mean, I am just making this up...
what is it?
we have to get out of here.
it is alright.
can not you see, she is trying to kill us.
she is gone.
what?
she can not be here without me.
how can you be sure?
i do not know, but i am.  she was there and then she was gone.  i felt it.
claire...
the leaves...
incredible.  we should take a drive before they are gone.  spend the night at some cozy little bed and breakfast.
look for antiques...
yep.  there is some great places nearby.
adamant.
what?
little village down seven.  supposed to be charming.
huh.
do you know it?
do not think so.
maybe we can stop there for lunch.
but he acted like he would never heard of it.
did he say that?
jody he was lying.
what if he was?  do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you are trying to make a new start?
i guess not.
he is trying to put it behind him, claire. you should too.
you have got a beautiful life.  and even with this, it is always been clear that he loves you.  I have come to think that is all that really matters.
i do not know...
trust me, claire.  you hear something... change the subject.  you find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake.  you know what happened.  the rest is only details.  and no one's ever glad they got a hold of those.  if you want to put this back together...just let it go.
what is that for?
nothing.
I am cooking you dinner.
you do not have to do that.
i know.
fine.  I will do the shopping.
she is out there is not she?  she is in the lake.
okay.  don't...you do not understand what this is.
do not i, norman?  you kept the fucking necklace.  of a woman you killed!
i did not!  i did not kill anyone.  jesus. claire, listen to me.  i walked in and she was lying there dead.  i swear to you.  on my life!  she took pills and she killed herself in our house to destroy me!  to destroy us!  if i had not stopped by here before school, the painters would have--
i do not believe you.
it is true.  that's...you have to believe me!  oh god, I am telling you the truth!  i did what i had to, claire.  she was gone.  there was nothing i could do for her.  i did...i put her in the lake.  i rolled the car in...and i watched it sink.  and I have lived with that image ever since.  i could not just stand there while everything-- my career, us, everything, just washed away.  do not you see, claire?  she is doing this!  this is exactly what she wants you to think!
mmmuh...
shhhh.
mauduh...
what?
madison!
