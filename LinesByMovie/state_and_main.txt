...not at all...
...we need the shooting permit for main street...
whatever you need.  the city council, of course, has to pass on your...
...the city council...

do not let me dis...i'll just...
no, no...please.
this is joe white.
how can i thank you?  how can i repay you for this part?  it is a...what a, thank you for this part.  the first scene at the old mill...
what, what is there to think about?  the scene's perfect...i, i get to say...
yes, but, joe, joe's been, well, he is just been having a few, uh, "thoughts," about...
how many times in your life do you get a speech like that?
yeah.
this scene is why I am doing the movie. "look at the mill, frank -- look at the way it goes around...half of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
yes, yes, but...
"...but still it rises up...it rises up, frank, high as it can go."
yeah.  joe?  would you, uh, tell claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you have been...
so young, so unlined, so full of promise.  so innocent.
i beg your pardon?
i quit.
you quit.
i quit the movie.
why did you quit?
actually, I am not sure if i quit.  i think that i got fired.  I am such a liar. i never could tell the truth.
do not be so hard on yourself.
i just got kicked off my first movie.
well.  everybody has reversals.  if you were never down how would you know when you were up?
that is good.  that is really good.  you have a gift for words.
it is in your play.
you like my play.
yes.
why?
it is about life.
could you tell me when is the next train?
n'about ten minutes.  what was your movie about?
no, of course, you do not want to talk about it.
it is about a man who gets a second chance.
evening, annie.
evening, cal.  would you tell me about it?
i...
no, of course, you want to get out of town.
it's...
ever wonder why the dalmation's the symbol of the firehouse?
first organized fire department was on the border of dalmatia and sardinia in the year 642.
but why the dalmation?
it was either that, or a sardine.
you get what you pay for.
that is true.  you grow up here?
central high, 'n' matinees, the bijou theatre.
...that...that he prayed for a second chance.  but...do you see?
yes.
that, he says, there are no second chances...that he is been presented what he prayed for...and: he is ruined it.
yes...
but, but but but...
no, no, i see...
that: in an act of...
yes...
of mercy...off...
i understand...
...that...he sees that...
as the old mill goes around...
of course, of course that is what I am saying.  as the old mill goes around, he sees...
of course.
...that it has been vouchsafed to him.
that is that is that is that is beautiful...
and you are the only one who will ever hear that speech.  just you.
well.  it was a pleasure meeting you.
and likewise.
goodbye.
goodbye.
so that the old mill, the old mill represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
no, no.  of course, that is exactly what it represents...
that whole...
the, the, the, the sanctity of everyday things...
everyday things...yes.
for example, he is just come back from a fire and he...um...  that is a fine house.  you look at that, and you know, there is nice people that live there.
i live there.
really.  with the porch swing and everything...
surest thing you know.
i do not mean to impose, but...do you think we might...
that is what the swing is there for...
...that's what the swing is there for...thats its purpose, isn't it...
...i always thought so...
...such a pleasant sound.
mmm.
cause, cause, it's...it's the simple things, that...
yes...
...that.

then, you write that.  and then this is our second chance.  that is why we are here...
i want to make a good film.
i know you do.
and maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, i...
hey, it is with the gods.  we do not have the money, we have to write it out.  the best or not.  and that is a lesson.  you get your typewriter yet...?

you would know better'n me.
how can you say that?
it is in your script...it's about getting a second chance.  innit?  "you can go back..."
i can?
you bet your life.  "the mill wheel goes around...some times it is even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."
but how do i...how do i do a film called "the old mill," when i do not have an old mill?
well, first, you got to change the title...
we need a new name for the movie. where is the writer?
wally, i got to takes out that window from the dog.  i can not shoot through...

yes.

i...i...

...i can not do it, wally...
listen to me:  elanora duse was playing hamlet in london in 1905, and royalty could not get a ticket.  she said, "i'm not doing the seven shows a week i signed for."  she said, "i cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  i am an artist. I will do four shows a week."  the greatest actress of her time.  you know what her producer said?
what?
nothing.  he held her and he wept. because he...
...i...
because he understood.  that was her life's blood on the stage.
...i know...i know...
...and, and, and did she...?  and she did the seven shows...
no, she did not claire.  but i think you should do the scene.
wally...

how...?
wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see?  and you get a second chance!
no, i don't...
he does not go back to the mill, he gets a second chance to go back to the firehouse...
this is, look:  go you huskies.  ...what i see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, fire and water.  the firehouse, and the old mill...do you know, you could...

...we had a script conference...
i told her thank you very much, but it was inconvenient because...uh... because...
you can do it.
because I would met someone else.
oh okay.
you believe that?
i do if you do.
but it is absurd.
so is our electoral process.  but we still vote.
do you truly believe the electoral process is absurd?
i used to go out with a politician.
you used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
sure did.
why?
time for a change.  keep your margins straight.
yes.
go you huskies!
where the hell have you been...?  it's...
sherry, this...
I have got two days to get this house...
dear, this is mr. rossen, he is the producer...
i am so glad to meet you.  we are so glad to have you here, and welcome you to our...i, you know, they had c...i'm, yearly i redecorate our, to restore it to the, 1835...
what is that...?
...the house, the 1835.  the original kitchen, of course, burned in 1960, as part of a spate of fires...
it is lovely.
a spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the waterford huskies...
my oh my.
i'm...tuesday evening we are having an informal dinner, i did not know you would be 'on set,' but if you would like to join your...
i have to talk to you.
doug, this is mr...
...he's the producer of the movie.
i want you to hear this, pal...  forget the overages, forget ten thousand dollars for three days to two weeks.  you know what it would cost for them to build this set?  two million dollars!  now:
doug...
now:  the waterford merchant's association, of who i am council...
"assembly of death" did 95 million dollars the first weekend.
yeaup, but those grosses are inflated.
you think so?
waal, what was the per-screen average...?
good morning to you...whatsa matter?
i can not get it to come out right.
what is the scene...
it used to be the old mill.
what have you got?
they meet on main street.  her horse has just died.  he is coming from the fire.
what about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling you how to wr...
please...
how about, he sees her on the street, he wipes the soot from his eyes.  he goes up to her.  "what happened to the horse?" she looks at him.  she takes his hand...
ah.  ah.  ah...
i hurt you?
...he stuck a fishhook in it.
she realizes -- it was not the fire which hurt him...that the true hurt was her. was her...
...yes.
...her unbridled sexuality.  that he...
...yes.
has been wounded by her heat...by her infidelities...
because it is about purity...
that's...that's exactly what it is about. take...
that is right...
...take any two people...
...the finest people you could ever hope to work with...  you have the new old mill pages?
i can not find the writer.
...totally false...totally false.  he is the, i would say the most responsible human being i have ever...
i have to talk to you.  my wife...
not now.
my wife is going to have a baby, and...
oh, that is great.  let's bring more people into this overcrowded world.
not now, I am talking to the press. claire!
what?  i have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
i, uh...  I have always thought so...  well, you just get an idea, and try to find the best way to express it in pictorial form.  I have written a letter to the studio and to sag protesting...  bill: get a copy of that letter...!  i just wanted to tell you that i am past chagrined, I am mortified at the way you were spoken to...
i...
an artist of your caliber...
I am only trying to...
i know what you are, i am so sorry that you...when i read that script i said there is only one person to play that part.
the minute i read that script i said...
i know...
...she works with animals, she...
...yes...
...she has a home...
...i know, I am so...because i said: yes, a woman who...the...the community respects her.  please do not go.  please do not go.  what can i do but beseech you...?  trauma, toil...when are we free of them...?  when...?
he treated me as if i were a child...
claire:  as an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  stay with me.  i need you.  we start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to us.  stay.  stay.  tonight...when...  when they have gone.  let's talk.  let's really talk.  we could, we will have dinner, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we will get spaghetti, and we'll...
I am sorry walt -- it is gone beyond that.
well, I have enjoyed it, too.  any... any...any time...  what does the woman want from life...?
she wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
pay her off.
we do not have the money.
find it.
if you do the product placement...
it is a computer comany...it's a computer company, bazoomer-com?
"bazoomer dot com."
i can not put a computer in a movie shot in 1895...you wanna tell me how I am gonna' do that?
actually, the art department had some ideas on...
no no no no no, pay her off.  did you hear me?
gimme howie gold.  howie?  thizz...i neee...i need eight hundred grand.  i...i do not care where it comes from...  it comes out of our end.  i...i need...just get me the money. i...just get me the goddamn money...look:
she does not show her tits!!!  she does not show her tits.  the breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
the breasts symbolize motherhood...
the movie's about purity.  so we do not show her breasts.  we show them to him, her back to the camera.
...she keeps her back to the camera...?
it will hurt the box office.
they know what her tits look like.
know?  they could draw them from memory. you are fantastic.  what a find you are. get outta here.  we need the dead horse scene.
I am going to nail it.
i know you are.  go you huskies.
we got the permit.

he just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
he is got a gift for fiction.
we got to do something nice for him.
you see where tom miller's playin' the old farmer?
he is been playin' old farmer nigh on sixty years.
i read for that part.  did pretty good too.

but i could not r'member all the words. ast them would they gimme a second chance.

mr. barrenger.
I am very sorry to...

i have to ask you these...um.  you have a valid drivers license...?
of course he...
could i see it please...?
well, now, mr. barrenger, I am very sorry, in fact, I am as sorry as i could be, but...
I am an attorney, if there is anything you have to say to...
...i have to give you this ticket for damage to city property.  I am really sorry, sir, it is a formality, i hope you will excuse...
you have to what?
it is a formality.  any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  they'll, uh, these things happen, i hope you are alright, and that you are feeling...
well, officer, do not worry ab...
if there is anything i...

i did not say anything special, i was just talking out loud.
...how else can you talk?
no, that is true.
no.  you, i told them, you can not betray with the picture what you are saying with the words.  and, i do not know, the movies, i do not know.  they should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?

I am so comfortable with that, walt, i can not tell you...
well, joe said it, and he is right.
and i have mr. barrenger's tuna b...
thank you.
i, well, you know, i tried to take him, in his room.
i think he is moved...

big day last night.
hope to tell you.  did not i pick the fragments of glass out of bob barrenger's actual head myself.
cluster of events.  do not see something, ten years, allasudden.  three times inna night.
that is what they call an events cluster. some guy, nobby orders a manhattan, fifteen, twenty years, allasudden, three times inna night.

who got their heads cut?
uh.  bob barrenger, fella, cameraman...
you said three...?
did i?  i think you are mistaken.
arrest him.
what is the...?
arrest him.
conspiracy in statutory rape?  okay.  of whom?
this young woman.
nobody touched me, i was at home.
who is it raped you?
nobody.
well, what is the beef?
she was in the car with bob barrenger last night.  and she was injured coming home from a love tryst, so...
you were in the car with bob?
no.
then what is the...?
it is a mistake.  it is all over.  I am sorry that we have inconvenienced you.
i was not in the car.
we know that you weren't.
...upset and impressionable...  get me the mayor...
...i was just talking to that girl in the other room.
...overcome by the events around her, the presence of a high-powered...
i never touched her.  my mother's gr...
and a fantasy object...
wally...?
look, carla.  this is a hard time for you.  many young people go to hollywood. i did...and we all dream of it, and here, here hollywood has come to you...
her...
i swear that that woman in my room...
mmm.
that we could use you in and i think that is quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
here it is: statutory r...blah, blah, blah, blah..."statutory"..."unsupported testimony by the..."  hold on, bobby...  you have got nothing, and you know it.  by god, you know it.  harassment.  you need a...even if this was true, you need a witness.  you need someone puts her in the car, and you have got nothing.  now we all have...yes, give her that part in the film.  yes, we would love to have you...now: we all have more important things to do, is not that right...?
yes?  hello, mr. mayor.  nothing, just an, an unfortunate...  it is the mayor, he is saying...
is he cool or angry?
well, these things happen.  purpose of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of cigarettes mr. barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary requirements...
so we just got lucky.
marty, it is howie gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
and i need a drink.
if your memory was as long as your dick, you would be in good shape.  how long since you almost went to jail for this shit?
how could she turn on me like that?  i thought she liked me.
can we try to keep our pants buttoned and get out of this town in one piece?
I am ready!
stay ready.  stay by yourself in your room.
what will i do for fun?
whyn't you learn your lines?
i know my lines...

i just do not know what order they come in...
hey, you have got to eat a peck of dirt...
my wife just went into labor...
half a buck I would close it down...it's per...you know, it is perfidy, you got your barrenger, molesting little girls...
he should be put in jail.
half a buck I would put him in jail...
you should.
i had a witness i would.
a witness to what...?
you know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
you mean with white...?

you mean you need a witness in addition to white...?
who is white...?
the writer.
he saw the accident...?

he saw the girl in the car...
you bet he did.

i signed the permit.  i do not know how i can.
i want them thrown in jail.
sherry, sherry...
good morning.
sleep well?
yeah, you?
oh yeah.
I have been thinking: look at this: we live up here...
yes...
we could live up here, live up in the country.
now you are talking...
...and we could get up every morning...
...well, we do that anyway...
and come to the printshop.  you know why...?
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
to print the newspaper.  and I would come to write.  to write.  to write.  right here in the office.
not without a rolltop desk.
well, i could get a rolltop desk.
happen to know where there is one for sale.
well am not you amazing.
lookit that, up already.
that is why we filmfolk get along so well with you farmers.  both up with the chickens.
well you guess what.  the mayor sent me. i have your mr. barrenger with a history of...
...a history of nothing, he was acquitted...
moral turp...you're on my home court, friend, i have the mayor and the town behind me, and forget making your movie: i may own the studio when i get through with you: i got a civil suit, i got rape, i got collusion...
you have got nothing, you do not have a witness...
and I have got a witness!  your mr. white saw the crime.
he told you that...
he did not have to tell...
i want to talk to him.  would you ex...
oh, you are his attorney, too...?
later for you, pal.
okay...
bobby, do not say anything.
nothing happened.
what is it all about?
i saw...
how do they know that, you told them?
no.
what did you say to them...?
i did not say anything to them.
how do you know you saw it?
i do not know.
well, then, you did not see it, right...?
i don't...
you did not see it...
i...?  i saw it.  i was there.
you were there.  at...at 10:35...?
i was walking down the street...i remember, i was writing a...
what glasses were you wearing?  were you wearing your reading glasses...?
i...
you told me you were writing.  do not you wear your reading glasses to write...?
what am i gonna do?
you got to tell em that you saw the accident.  do not you?
i can not do that.  if i tell them, they'll, if i tell them, they will try bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
but that is what happened.
but it will stop the movie.
maybe they will be other movies.
they'll...they'll blackball me...
carla was in the car, right?
i...i think that is right...
...you think that is right...
let's speak english.  you have got to help the side.
you want me to lie.
to the contrary.  i want you to tell the truth.  the truth is, you can not tell me, to a certainty, that you saw the thing.  you do not remember, a gun to your head, which glasses you have on.  and you have a fertile imagination.  imagination wants to fill in the blanks.  now.  if you are not sure, then they have nothing.  bob walks free.  as he should.  joe:  was not long ago they buried actors at the crossroads with a stake through their heart.  you know?  the people who are talking to you about the way we live though we may praise them, we fear them. and they fear us.  because we tell the truth.  about our lives.  now, this is a damn roust, and everyone knows it; the guy is looking for a case, he wants to make a name for himself.  if we let him do that, if we let him do that, then we are being false to our community...to our community, you understand...?  to our world.  cause you are a part of that world, now.  you have to take off the steel rolex and put on the gold rolex.  and be part of your world.  i got a five picture deal with the studio.  and you stick with me.  you write one, two more, you stick with me, and you will direct the third one.  you are a part of this world. it is in your blood.  it is you.  you have to do the right thing:  we are out in the provinces, the sheriff, literally is at our door.  you have to stand with the troops, joe.  that is the bottom line. you have to...if you had the leisure to think it through, you would see it for yourself.  the girl was not in the car.
where you off to?
i, uh...i'm leaving.
why?
i perjured myself.  i told a lie, and i ruined my life. that is what i did...  i do not suppose you could help me with that, could you?  turn back the clock, or something?  give me back my, give me back my purity, i do not suppose you could just wave your magic wand and do that, could you...?  but what is truth? eh?  in't that the thing?  what is true?
it is the truth that you should never trust anybody, wears a bowtie.  cravat's sposed to point down to accentuate the genitals, why did you wanna trust somebody, s'tie points out to accentuate his ears...?
are not you supposed to set an example for people...?
nope.  I am just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  what did you say your problem was...
...i just swore my life away, back in that...
mornin, chessy...how's the back...?
what courthouse?
courthouse back in town.
town am not got no courthouse.
what?
am not got no courthouse.  courthouse burnt down, 1960.
well, where do they hold court?
hold court, they have to, science lab, the high school.
what are you going to do?
I am going to tell the truth.
do something.
you tell me what to do, I will do it.
thank god, it is up to you, pal.  sup to you...
I am out.
i do not getcha.
the girl was in the car.
i treated you like a son or nephew.
it is not you, it's...
no, what is it?
i have to tell the truth.
...that's just so narrow...
the girl was in the car.
then you are finished in show business.
so be it.
and my company sues your ass for sixty million dollars.
for what cause?
i do not need a cause, just a lawyer.
hi.
I would prefer it if you did not speak to me.
i...
...you know, there is nothing you could say, that could possibly make a difference, so, why do not you just save your breath.
what is in the case?
eight hundred thousand dollars in cash.
and what was it you wanted to say?
gut yuntif.
I will wait for you...i'm proud of you. I will be waiting.
if i go to jail...?
I will knit you a sweater.
mornin, sister.
we missed you in church today, frank.
sister, I have just come from a fire...
mom's expecting you for dinner tonight.
I will be there.
