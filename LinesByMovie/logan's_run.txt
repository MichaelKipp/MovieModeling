you are here. i could not believe it when they told me. what are you doing?
turn this way.  no, no... not you... you!
you should have seen me take my last runner... perfect.  i backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated... his hand...  so now you have seen him... what is the difference awake or asleep?
open your eyes once, idiot.  it is not every day that a sandman son is born. I am telling you, francis -- that is him!
maybe, maybe not. what is the difference? come on, logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out.
break-in scanners report intrusion, identify.
logan-5... francis-7, authorized duty quadrant. intrusion accidental.
clear logan-5 and francis-7.
had enough?
even the alarm did not wake him.
you need a lift. let's go to arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... logan-6.
has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
not in my time...
why?
just wondered... what happens?
dunno... flameout maybe. whatever happens, you can bet it is final. but who would want to find out?
but you do not know, you just say what everyone says. "one for one. one for one."
well, why not!? that is exactly how everything works. how else could the city stay in balance -- you have a better idea?
no, but at least i wonder sometimes -- instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. you sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.
well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.  you know, logan -- you wonder a lot. too much for a sandman.
well? how do you like it?
i do not know. the cheeks maybe... look a little --
cheeks? cheeks? right. too much, you think?
too little.
too little?  too little. okay, wait for me.
did you ever see francis-8?
i never even visited nursery before tonight.  when you wonder, it slows you up -- you know?
i do not know what makes you so curious. you have any idea who his seed-mother was?
of course not! I am curious, not sick.
you missed something special.
well... you can not have them all.
the damned yellows are getting out of hand. those three ought to be in cathedral. no business scrambling in arcade...
what an old, old man you are getting to be, francis. were not you ever a yellow? i bet you were even wilder than --  come on, sandman.
you should have been with us in nursery, daniel. I am positive i recognized him --
come on. i do not want to miss the filing-in. there'll be some i know tonight, i think...
now there is a few who could have been his seed-mother.
only a few? you are just not trying.
who invited you?
I am in my party mood.
that was a great shot you made.
yes.  but you look a little rusty to me -- what were you doing, wondering?
what is wrong, available?
please... no.
please... no?  you mean "not here" -- that is it? you are a private available but particular.  do not worry. there is no one here but me. and you.
no.  just no.
you prefer women?
no.
well then...?
nothing. i felt sad, i put myself on the circuit. it was a mistake.
sad? what made you sad?
a friend of mine went on carousel tonight. now he is gone.
yes... probably he was renewed?
he was killed.
killed? why do you use that word?
is not it right? is not that what you do? kill.
i never 'killed' anybody in my life. sandmen terminate runners.  who brought you?
nobody. i felt sad... i put myself on the circuit.
you felt sad. what is your name?
jessica.
you are beautiful. let's have sex.
no.
later.
no.
but you put yourself on the circuit!
i thought i had to do something.
and?
i changed my mind.
and now?
curious.
about what?
how a sandman lives.
let's have sex.  i thought you were curious.
not about that.
I am listening.
I am afraid to tell you.
I am not armed.  well?
why is it wrong to run?
you should not even think such things...  and you picked a strange person to say them to --
i suppose. but what if you want to live?
so? do what everyone does. try like hell for renewal.
but if you are one of the misfits... that is where i come in.
i did not say that i would run... i just...
are you a 5 or a 6?
six. i go red next year.
you are years away... i do not know why you are thinking of these things, much less talking about them.  want to try?
what quad do you live in?
k.
you are sure you do not want to try?
i just might look in on new you 483 myself.
you? why? you are already beautiful.
no -- it is that last runner -- someone in 483 was trying to help him.
what the hell took you so long?
did you ever see anybody renew?
i think you have been skulling out too much. first nursery and now stupid questions.
did you?
of course.
anybody we know?
look... why do not you get into the water... you need it... more than i do.
I am fine...  see you...
at carousel tonight?
you could have called me yourself.
but i was not sure you would come.
here i am.  shall i come in?
i could not get you out of my mind.
I am the most beautiful woman you have ever seen, i suppose?
maybe... sure...
thanks... but i have the choice.
of course.
then it is still no.
you can have any woman in the city. what do you really want?
you know.
i do not believe you. there has to be more.
all right.
why show me?
I am going to run.
why tell me?
you know something.
about running, dying what?
both... running's what I am interested in.
i know what everyone knows. try like hell for renewal. you have the same chance everyone else has.
it is different now. help me.
how can i?
where did you get that?
a runner gave it to me.
and then you killed him, right?
i let him go... believe me.
i don't..
speak to your friends for me, jessica... please...
please? what friends?
i do not have much time.
i never heard of a sandman running... ever...
and i never heard of sanctuary.
no -- just there -- on the first level.  do not look for us. we will see you.
you do not seem quite sure, jessica.  can you do it? will you?
are you here to help me?
what do you need?
what are you going to do?
that is tomorrow.
i wish i could help you.
maybe you will think of something...
i wish i knew what you think i know.
if you did know, you would tell me.
of course --
if you trusted me, you would know.
we are coming to arcade.  shall we relive together?
a runner... cathedral. a woman.
you are not going, are you?
why not? maybe she will help me. you won't. you would better stay here.
I would rather be with you.
that is nice.
they are like beasts. wild.
maybe they are angry because they are grown in meccano-breeders.
instead of what? nine months inside a woman:  we are all raised the same but most of us do not become cubs in cathedral.
some people say children need human mothering.
insane. nurseries are better than any mother could be.
I am only telling you what I have heard...  have not you ever wondered what your seed-mother was like...?
uh-uh.
i have.
when did you begin to question lastday?
i do not remember exactly... except i was a green.  what would you like to relive, logan?
let's see -- how long has it been?
just follow -- no matter how it seems...
but what is this -- why?
the cubs. when they are flying on muscle there is no way to catch up. without the dazzle, they would just go past us --  -- too fast
muscle? i do not know that one.
what is your name?
I am mary 2.
where do you live, mary?
here.
why are not you in nursery?
I am very smart.
when do you go up?
i never go upstairs. you are a nice old lady.
I am a sandman!
i cut up a sandman yesterday. they said I would never get him... but i cut him up good, i did.
i feel sorry for you, boy!
for me? better feel sorry for yourself, sandman!
no, for you! how old are you, billy?
fourteen? fifteen? your days are running out. how long can you last? a year. six months?  what happens when you are sixteen and you go green?
nothing will happen! i make the rules as i go!! cubs do what i say! always have! always will! i got cathedral and I will never let go!
no cubs over fifteen, billy! ever heard of a cub with a green flower? you will leave cathedral then, billy, when you are on green, because they will not let a green stay here.  if you try to stay the young ones will gut-rip you apart!
shut up! shut up your damn mouth!
I am ashamed. i was bringing you to be killed.
where? sanctuary? can you take me there?
logan, i do not know where sanctuary is. but if i take you to them, they will kill you.
all right. but why? i did not kill the runner.
yes, but they will not know that... or care. they are hunting you, logan. maybe me too, now...
that is nothing... there is a sandman behind us, too and there'll be more soon. take me to them.
i -- i can't.
then -- why do not you leave me -- go to them -- explain
no. not that either.
hello, sandman.
hello.
do you want to see doc?
we do not get many sandmen. i think we have only had one other since I have been here.
a sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. where is the doctor?
i like your face. would you mind if doc took a picture? I would like him to give your face to somebody else.
it is all right with me. is he here?
my name's holly... holly 13. in ancient times they said my number was unlucky. do you believe in luck?
no -- look, I am in a hurry.
it is a real privilege, sandman.
thanks.  i thought you would be older. i expected a red.
i am.
your own work?
and i did it myself right on there.
i designed it myself.  what will it be... a face job or a full-body job?
just the face.
fine... holly will get you ready. you are in good hands, believe me.
do you have anything special in mind?
i do not care... just get it over with.
hurry... hurry... hurry.
what is going on, logan?!
it has nothing to do with you.
what are you talking about?! i saw you let a runner go?  i saw you, logan?? tell me!!
are you taking me to them?
yes.  i do not know what else to do -- with him following us.  why do you keep running from your --
because he is my friend --  and i do not want to be killed by him -- or anyone.
he is good, is not he?
will he find us and kill us? yes... or one of the others.  you know there is only one place to go now...
they will not believe us.
I would rather take my chances with them... than with francis.
they will not listen.
you think sandmen will?  there is no other way for me,
we will convince them.
exactly four steps now. let me lead you.  now to the right. it is narrow here, you will have to get behind me.
how will they know we are coming?
they are watching us now. they will let us in when they are sure.
it is him! the first sandman. he killed... doc.
no, holly -- wait! he is running. tell them the rest!
he is the one. you too. i remember. he was in a hurry. just a face job. dark hair, i said. then he killed doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and i ran... i ran.
holly. holly! please... the other sandman. remember the one who came after --
that is right. the other one came after. the older one. smashing, killing, burning!
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. was not he? was not he? this one was running, the other one was hunting him...
yes. oh yes.  he was after you. i remember. you are running!
i do not know who you are. I would like to thank someone.
it does not matter who we are. follow the tunnel to the end.
will there be someone to tell us where to go from there...?
someone will follow. when you come to the lock, he will tell you how to go on the other side. jessica may go with you as far as the lock.
no. jessica goes back now. take her back.  now! go on back. back outside, jessica.
will you take me with you?
why, jessica? you are still a green.
how do we know this is the right way?
it is the only way.
what do you suppose this was...?
some kind of breeding pens... i suppose... they say people used to breed animals, fish, anything...  ...to eat, of course.
ycch.  to kill things and then eat them. it must have been a savage world.
I am afraid.
it is brighter there... besides, we can not go back.
i do not know what is going to happen to us logan but --  are you glad you did not kill him?
it does not make any difference anymore.
you are really one of us now, are not you?
you knew that i was not before, did not you?  why did you stay with me?
i wanted to...  ...and you... what made you kill sandmen?
i had to. i did kill... for the first time in my life i killed.
because you felt like a runner, did not you.
i guess so... i know i felt something i never felt before... and i did not like it... not a bit.  I will tell you one thing... sanctuary better be worth it. that is the last place for me to live now.
for us.
are you too startled? am i too removed from your ken?  I am neither machine nor man... but a perfect fusion of the two... and better than either.  no human sculptor could match this greatness... do not you agree?
all right -- what are you?
your turn.
we are hungry do you have anything to eat?
anything to eat?
how do you think we got here??!!
you walked in. i saw you. do not you remember?
where do you think we came from?
from? from? from?
we were sent here and you know it. others have been sent here. where are they? hiding?
hiding? yes! hiding, hiding.
where do we go?!  where do we go from here??!!
is that the wind?  not yet...  you must hear my birds sing.
you know about sanctuary! i know you do! you have to help us! you do not have a choice! it is not your decision!! tell us.
never a pair. i have never had a pair.
where do you send them?
you are a beautiful pair.
answer the question!
do you know how long all this will last? not thirty years... or thirty thousand years... but thirty thousand years... and you will be part of it. ages will roll... ages. and you will be here... the two of you... eternally frozen... frozen... beautiful.
there must be somebody else up here. i can not believe that he is --
let me sculpt you and i will show you where the others have gone.
that is better.  how do you want us?
nude. imagine, a pair.
it will be all right...
how do you want us?
up there.
all right. now you keep your bargain.
wait for the wind! wait and hear the birds sing over you!
we are ready.
how did they get in here?
regular storage procedure... the same as the other food... the other food stopped coming and they started.
what other food?
fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  it is all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... and then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. so i store them here. I am ready. and you are ready. it is my job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
what is that?
it feels like breath. it makes everything move. your hair is moving.
and yours.
i hate outside! i hate it!
we will be all right...  we will...
don't!
sooner or later, we will have to try something.
it is getting dark and cold. I am tired.
why do not we rest here? we know we can eat these.
do you think everything's going to turn to ice?
i doubt it.
do not ever let go.
i won't.
it all seemed to make sense until box.
do you think he was telling the truth?
maybe we are the first ones to get through...  maybe sanctuary is near, now... another protected place. it could not be outside.
how would anyone know? even if we find it -- we can never go back.
you are right... it must be near now. we will find it.
thirty thousand years did not last very long, did they?
what does it mean?
the lifeclocks have no power outside.
you can have any woman in the city. what do you really want?
you know, jessica.
...but i still have the choice...?
of course.
then the answer's yes...
i have never seen a face like that before. it must be the look of great age. whoever he was he was terribly old.
yes, do you think that is why he looks so sad?
they all have names and numbers on them. i wonder what they are?
"beloved husband". "beloved wife". what can all that mean?
look at his face... and his hair...  is that what it is to grow old?
it could be...
yes, cats, of course. what else could they be? cats. of course each one has his own name too.
but there are so many of them. do you know each one separately.
yes indeed, everyone. actually, they all have three.  "the naming of cats is a difficult matter. it is not just one of your holiday games. you may think at first I am mad as a hatter when i tell you a cat must have three different names."  an ordinary name and a fancy name. that is two. do you want to guess what the third one is?
how long have you been living here?
for as long as i can remember.
what kind of place is this?
just a place, i suppose... who knows?
how did you get here?
i have always been here...
are there any other humans?
gracious... no.
have any other people ever passed through?
but there may be a few around somewhere.
what makes you think so?
my parents thought so. mother and father. you know?
mother and -- ? you knew your mother and father?
and... and how were you grown? inside your mother?
yes...
are you sure?
mother and father said so... you know?
where are they?
dead... they are dead... and buried.
they are beautiful. may i have one too please?
no -- I am sorry. it is not possible.
it is not fair. I will give you one of my favorite cats... a jellicle cat.  "jellicle cats have cheerful faces, jellicle cats have bright black eyes; they like to practice their airs and graces and wait for the jellicle moon to rise."
I am sorry but i do not have anything to give you.
what kind of jewel is this?
i do not know.
you are both full of secrets like macavity.  did you steal this?
no.
"macavity, macavity, there is no one like macavity, there never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity."
what is beyond this place -- do you know?
no, no, no
did your mother or father ever mention another place?
never, never, ever. nothing.
may we stay here for a while? we would like to rest.
of course you can stay. this belongs to the people.
what belongs to the people?
all this. all of it.
what people?
i do not know... but it does.
that sweet madman -- how could he come to exist?
he had a mother and father -- and he knew them.
one in a million, i suppose
there is a sanctuary... there is!
you want there to be one... that doesn't...
there has to be! i know it exists! it has to!!
no, there doesn't. not really -- just so many want it to exist... so many who do not want to die... want it so much that a place called sanctuary becomes "real". but it does not exist. it never existed. just the hope.
you are wrong!! it has to be!! it just has to be!!
why did you do that??!!
i did not do anything, francis! they have made us believe that...
why did you do that???!!!
we will have to bury him.
what is that?
they are put into the ground so they can be visited by the living...
I will make the arrangements.
at least it is over...
are you ready to put him in?
not yet.
all right.
of course... that is settled then. but just you remember your promise...
we will remember. but that is a long time off...
what are we promising him? what can we possibly give him?
he asked if we would bury him when his time comes.
we can't. we are going back.
to what?
I am going to try and tell people what we have seen and --
you are lying! you will never have the chance to tell anybody anything! you will be killed the moment you are seen!
do you expect me to let things go on without trying to change them?!
things will not change... you know that! we can live here together, logan... have a life as long as his... together!
things change!
you want to go back to kill, is that it?! now, you will want to kill your own!!! kill sandmen!!! killing's all you ever...!!!
jessica... listen to me... listen to me...  the lifeclocks made me kill francis. they make people die or be killed every day. if i did not try and destroy that... i could not live here or anywhere. do you understand?
i want to be alive and with you, that is all i want.
we are leaving.
what a pity. i was hoping you would be here to bury me.
come with us.
where are you going?
to a city with thousands and thousands of people.
alive?
thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
more... many more.
and all alive you say?
is that really it? it does not seem very far. will we be there soon?
i promise. we will go on as soon as it is light.
that is better than gold when it is cold.
thank you.  tell me -- what do those words mean? "beloved husband"... "beloved son"... "beloved wife"...
my father was the husband and my mother was the wife. "beloved" is a word they used -- to stay together.
stay? they lived together all their years?
oh, yes... i think...
"beloved son"...  so people stayed together for that feeling of love... they would live and raise children together and be remembered.  i think i feel that way, logan. can we be that way?
yes. you and i, jessica.
and sanctuary?
sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. but nothing less, either...
beloved husband...
beloved wife...
what does that water do?
it is part of the hydrogalvanic system. the ocean tides are changed into energy somehow.
is it inside the city?
of course.  i do not know where...  i just took them for granted.  it is our only chance.
i know...  we are going to try and get in this way. i do not think you can make it.
oh... i did so look forward to seeing all those people.
I am sorry.
yes...
can you make it back?
oh my... I will try.
goodbye.
oh, my...
