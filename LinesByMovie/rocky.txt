mr. gazzo wants the two hundred now!
honest to god i'm broke -- gimme a break.
mr. gazzo says i should get two hundred or break the thumb.

...how's the turtle food this week?
...fine.

...i'm sorry.
ain't your fault -- here's the problem.
i smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... what?
...i don't know.
shell-shocked!
startin' with the bad jokes early today, huh.
inventin' jokes ain't easy.
how's butkus this mornin'?

...what kinda dog is this again?
bullmastiff.
the owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
we're not responsible for animals left over thirty days -- we board it ain't a animal shelter, y'know... adrian, i want you to clean all those cat cages downstairs, they're a mess.

...of the truck that run over your face.
yo rock. did i give you a job this mornin? how come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like i asked ya? when ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.
i figure if i break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
it don't matter. it's my reputation. these guys think they can get off light. it's bad for my reputation -- it's bad for business. see ya killer.
yo, mike -- what's happenin' here?
it ain't your locker no more.
whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
listen, i'm with you -- but ya gotta talk to mickey -- i put ya stuff in the bag over there.
you were ready to bite that guy's face.
yeah -- see the fight last night? apollo creed beat that english guy bad.
creed's great.
i don't care what nobody says, this bum creed woulda never made it in the thirties --
hey, how ya feelin', mickey?
...what?
i said, how ya feelin'?
do you see me talkin'? huh?
yeah.
then stand there an' wait till i'm done -- creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but i gotta boy, y'know big dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- he's mean, quick, an' big -- what more d'ya need? okay, go to work...  hey -- yeah -- whatta ya want?
i was talkin' with ya man, mike. -- hey, how come i been put outta my locker?

...tomato?
facts is facts. i run a business here -- i'm cleanin' house --
how old are ya?
...what?
how old?
come july, twenty-five.
more like thirty.
twenty-five, thirty -- what's the difference? -- it took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
the legs must be goin'.
yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... that was my locker for six years.
...did ya fight last night?
yeah --
did ya win?
yeah, kayo.
...who'd ya fight?
spider rice.
rice is a bum.
you think everybody i fight is a bum.
ain't they?
ya want the truth -- ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- the only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire.
listen, i'm gonna take a steam -- did good last night -- shoulda seen it.
hey, ever think about retirin'?
...no.
think about it.
yeah, sure.
hey, how's my buddy doin'?  -- nice dog -- well, i'll see ya later.
...goodnight, rocky.
yo, paulie.
yo, rocky -- look at this mirror. i'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
yo, paulie.
what?
your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
forget her. you could do better than my sister.
every mornin', every night i pass by -- i smile. i say jokes. nothin'. she looks at me.
looks, huh?
yeah, like i was a plate of leftovers -- somethin' wrong with my face -- whatta i need, a caddy to connect with ya sister?
my sister's a friggin' loser.
hey --
sometimes she gets me so crazy, i'd like to split her head with a razor.
don't get mental, man.
ya caught me in a bad mood.
ya always in a bad mood --
...adrian ain't sharp.
she's a loser -- she don't enjoy life -- she reads -- brainy -- pushin' thirty friggin' years old!  she's gonna die alone if she don't wise up.
i'm thirty myself.
an' you're dyin' alone, too.
i don't see no crowd around you, neither.
i wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
let's get outta this stink.
the girl's dryin' up! she's gotta live a little before her body dries up!! you're a pal, rock -- how 'bout yo' talk to her? y'know, it's thanksgivin' tomorrow.
...sure.
tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
absolutely...
how was the flight, champ?
very high an' very fast.
apollo, how would you rate this last british challenger, henry wilcoxson?
he was big, an' very nasty so i destroyed him in a hurry -- now i'm gettin' ready for mac lee green next month.
you're referring to the much publicized bicentennial fight?
that's right -- it's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- a gala occurrence!
still to be held in philadelphia?
the bicentennial heavyweight championship of the world is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- january first -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
where're you off to now?
me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
any quick advice for young boxing hopefuls?
...stay in school an' use your brains, dig -- be a lawyer, be a doctor, carry a leather briefcase an' forget about sports!! sports can only make ya grunt an' smell -- be a thinker not a stinker!!
yo, rocks, buy us sum wine, man.
...no wine -- bad for ya' brain.
c'mon, man, it's cold, man.
no wine.
yo, rock, gimme a dollar.
why?
'cause we dig ya, man -- gimme a dollar.
no dollar.
hey, give rocky a dime.
...that's an old one.
buy us some thunderbird, man.
...screw you.
what'd you say?
...screw you, yoyo.
did these guys teach you to talk dirty? huh?
hey --
what?
stuff it, man!
don't you never say that --  -- you guys talk like that in front of a little girl -- you guys are scum.
we'll kill you, man -- we gotta gun.
pull heat on me? -- i'll dent ya face!
how come ya wanna hang out with those guys? they teach ya bad things.
i like 'em. if you don't you can f --
hey! when i was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
...yeah.
make your teeth yella --
i like yella teeth.
makes your breath like garbage.
maybe i like garbage.
nobody likes garbage -- anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
why?
'cause that's the way guys are -- they laugh when ya talk dirty. they think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. ya get no respect... i gotta use a bad word -- whore. you'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
c'mon, rocky. i'm twelve.
that doesn't matter -- you don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
what?
yo, a bad reputation -- twenty years from now people will say 'd'you remember marie?' 'no, who was she?' 'she was that little whore who hung out at the atomic hoagie shop.' 'oh, now i remember!'... see, they don't remember you, they remember the rep.
listen, i hope ya don't --
i won't.
what was i gonna say?
ya hope i don't keep acting like a whore or i'll turn into one, right?
ya, somethin' like that.
goodnight, rocky.
'night, marie.
damn.
i suppose we could cancel the fight indefinitely if you are set on fighting green.
you best find me another ranked contender an' i mean in a flash, man!
i contacted ernie roman's manager, he's fighting in france the same week.
then gimme buddy shaw -- he's ranked fifth.
shaw's fighting in south america -- why not postpone the bout until july fourth?
shape, nothin' -- they're afraid. they know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
apollo, i'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
i do -- maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
you's the novelty, champ!
give my main man a raise!!
now here's what's goin' down. listen, 'cause i'm gonna say this but one time. on january first, the first day of the bicentennial i'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? a snow-white underdog. an' i'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? an' i'll tell you why, 'cause i'm sentimental -- an' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, apollo creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. now that's the way i see it an' that's the way i want it!!
...it's very american.
no, man, it's very smart.
next wednesday i grab a grand from snyder. an' thursday two yards from cappoli, okay?
no, two yards from snyder, an' a grand from cappoli.
ya sure?
hey, screw ya brain on right. now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
how'd you know?
you think i don't hear things?
paulie's sister.
hear she's retarded.
she ain't retarded, she's shy.
take 'er to the zoo -- retards like the zoo.
does that bum have to say that?
buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
he's always in a bad mood.  count ya blessin's. ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
i don't like ya face.
don't like yours neither.
kiss my ass.
move your shoulders down.
buddy's got a thing against ya, rock. some people just hate for no reason, y'know.
yeah.
here's fifty bucks -- you an' the girl have a nice time.
thanks, mr. gazzo.
how 'bout this billy snow?
fouls.
how 'bout this big chuck smith?
too old, dull fighter.  bobby judge is a good boy.
...i don't feel heat from the name.
joe zack is a good prospect -- exciting boy.
...still don't feel no heat.
exactly what are you looking for, apollo?
...this man.
'the italian stallion' -- he's my man.
rocky balboa -- his record's poor --
don't matter -- that name. 'the italian stallion,' it's right on.  who discovered america? an italian, right? so, man, what could be better than to get it on with one of his ancestors --
he won't last one round.
listen, i gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
i don't like you messin' with southpaws -- they do everything wrong.
southpaw, nuthin' -- i'll drop 'im in three -- 'apollo creed meets the italian stallion.' shhiii -- sounds like a damn monster movie!!
i usta be deadly at half-ball.
i hate the friggin' game... i'd like to talk some business.
what kinda business?
look at my hands -- see how the joints are swollen.
inflamed joints -- walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
maybe ya should see a doctor.
i don't need a doctor, i need a different job.
maybe another job is the best thing.
do me a favor -- talk to gazzo. tell him i'm a friend an' would do a good job... tell him i ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... bustin' bones don't bother me -- tell him i'm a good worker.
gazzo's gotta come to you.
i'm askin' ya to go to him -- as a favor.
gazzo's gotta come to you -- hey, paulie, it's a bad job -- do what you do now.
ya sister knows i'm comin'?
yeah, sure -- she's very excited.
...paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! look at me, i'm not ready for this.
like it would make a difference if you were, right? this guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
no... i can't!
ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' i don't wanna know from nothin'.
paulie, please --
hey, i want ya out instamaticly. -- i'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- go out -- live! do, enjoy life.
...like you?
don't get wise with me. i want ya to stop bein' a loser.
i can't go out.
why?
paulie, it's thanksgiving. i've gotta turkey in the oven.
!! ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- i want ya outta the house -- enjoy ya friggin' life... ya hungry, rock?
maybe ya better forget it.
forget nothin' -- here, talk to my sister, tell 'er somethin' nice.
...maybe i better forget it.
try again, c'mon, try again.
what's ya sister like to do?
ice skate.
i didn't want no turkey anyway.
it's thanksgiving.
to you, to me it's thursday.
looks quiet, y'know.
i think it's closed.
i think mebbe we're early or somethin' --
hey, whatta ya doin' here -- we're closed... yo, we're closed!
are ya closed to the general public or to just everybody.
hey, the rink is empty 'cause we're closed -- ya ain't allowed in here so do me a favor an' not stay here.
wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
yo, pal, what's with you -- the place ain't operatin'.
listen, i gotta problem. this girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- the doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
this a con?
look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
few minutes?
...ten minutes.
ten minutes for ten dollars.
...yeah, give 'er the blades.
...aren't you skating?
ain't skated since i was fifteen -- that's when i started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. all i wanted to prove was i weren't no bum -- that i had the stuff to make a good pro.
and you never got the chance?
nine minutes!
hey, i ain't cryin'... i still fight. kinda do it like a hobby. see i'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- southpaw means lefthanded... but i guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
but you never had a chance to prove yourself.
absolutely.
i just dislocated my finger.
ohh!
seven minutes!
it ain't your fault -- i originally done it in the baby crenshaw fight.  that's me fightin' big baby crenshaw -- big baby was the size of an airplane an' i broke my hands on his head -- i lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
six!
how 'bout some cokes?
cost ya a buck.
this guy is beautiful -- get the cokes.
y'know how i got started in the fight racket?
by accident?
here -- three minutes.
yeah -- my ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- i weren't born with much brain so i better use my body.
what's funny?
my mother told me just the opposite. she said, 'you weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
that's ten bucks.
i must be goin' deaf 'cause i thought ya said, 'ten cents.'
...how 'bout for the cokes?
charge it.
some people are very shy by nature.
...i suppose.
i would say you're very shy by nature.
...i suppose.
some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
it doesn't bother me either.
then why did i bother bringin' it up? 'cause i'm dumb, that's why... y'know, i think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- i'm dumb an' you're shy.
...it is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... it's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
i don't think you're a bum.
...i'm at least half a bum. yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. the roughest part is the mornin' after.
morning after?
after a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. sometimes i feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... but the thing i'm proud of is i been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... that's rare.
why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
...guess.
'cause you can't sing or dance?
would ya like a glass of water?
...no thanks.
here's the guys i was tellin' ya about -- this is cuff an' link.
i sold them to you.
...oh, yeah, i bought the whole kit -- yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- i had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
do you have a phone?
i had it pulled. people callin' all the time.  who needs it -- who'd you wanna call?
i wanna let my brother know where i am.
d'you really wanna call?
yes, i do.
you sure?
yes.
why?
i think he might be worried.
i'll call your brother.
what's the matter? ya don't like the room?
it's fine.
it's only temporary.
it's not that --
what's the problem? you don't like me -- don't like the turtles -- what is it?
i don't think i belong here.
it's okay.
no, i don't belong here.
it's all right -- you're my guest.
...i've never been in a man's apartment before.
they're all the same.
i'm not sure i know you well enough -- i don't think i'm comfortable.
yo, i'm not comfortable either.
i should leave.
but i'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation.
would ya take off your glasses?
what?
the glasses... please.
...t-thank you.
do me another favor?
...what?
could ya take off that hat.
i always knew you was pretty.
don't tease me.
hey, rock -- what happened?
'bout what?
did ya get the message, kid?
message -- what message?
a rep from miles jergens' promotions was lookin' for ya -- they need sparrin' partners for creed.
ya puttin' me on?
here's the card?
when was they here?
'bout an hour ago.
probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
...i said that before.
hello, mr. balboa -- i'm miles jergens -- please, have a seat.
...thanks.
mr. balboa --
rocky.
rocky, do you have any representation? a manager?
no -- just me.
rocky, would you be interested in --
sparrin'?
excuse me.
i know ya need sparrin' partners -- i'm very available.
i'm sure you are.
absolutely -- sparrin' with the champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
what?
i wouldn't take no cheap shots. i'd be a good sparrin' partner.
rocky, would you be interested in fighting apollo creed for the championship?
...like i said, i'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
did you hear what i said?
sure, an' i'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the champ. he's just there to help condition the man.
not spar, i'm asking whether you would be interested in fighting creed for the championship.
do me a favor -- his lungs, punch 'em out.
paul.
this is your largest payday ever -- how do you feel about it?
feel? i dunno... happy.
how will you fight apollo creed?
creed's great, ain't he... i'll do what i can.
is it true the most you've ever made in a prizefight is five hundred dollars?
four hundred -- but that was a long time ago.
and now your payday will be one hundred and fifty thousand dollars. any comment?
listen, i wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- yo, adrian!
oh, rocky!
christ.
you didn't!
why?
don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- i'd break his lips.
it don't matter.
he's takin' cheap shots.
it don't bother me none.
yo, rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
help what?
y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
i'll do okay.
ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? nobody -- i think i'm gonna train myself.
without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
einstein flunked out of school... twice.
that so.
roosevelt finished last in his class -- beethoven was deaf, an' helen keller was blind -- i think rocky has a good chance.
how'd ya like hearin' ya name on tv?
i don't know -- i was shocked. why did you do that?
ya puttin' me on, right?
absolutely -- what time should i expect you?
'bout seven.
i'll be waiting.
y'know how i said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
yes.
it did.
y'know i won't be able to work for ya no more.
hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
i feel bad about walkin'.
take your shot, kid -- you got money for trainin' expenses?
a few bucks.
here's five hundred -- put it in your glove.
do i have to pay juice?
does santa claus charge juice? merry christmas -- now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?
gonna try.
listen, kid, i'm with ya. ya know, i'm with ya -- italian, we're blood. you kill this rug -- we guinneas gotta show these afro-americans where it's at. give it your best shot cause i want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... ya got any action on the side.
no action.
ya gettin 150 grand killer. ya got any plans for it? whatta ya think? ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
i'm gonna do somethin with it.
sure, you do what ya want. stay away from the stock market.
black market?
same thing. ya know, rock, remember when we was kids, we fought together. an' i wasn't well an' ya had to beat up that irish kid -- what's his name? -- gallager -- i bought a suit and became a businessman. you put on gloves. an' i remember mama almost cried, may she rest in peace -- an' our ol' man who said ya had no brains --i'd like to lay hands on that bastard. you ain't never had any luck. even when i owned you in '66 you never had luck. but now i think you might be gettin' some luck kid. whatta you think?
yo, you gonna show, tony?
where else am i gonna go.  bet three grand on rocky.
i seen the light. i figure somebody was home.
hey, mickey -- whatta ya doin' here? here, sit down.
best seat in the house -- hey, mick, this is too much.
how do you mean?
i'm usta seein' ya at the gym, but seein' ya here, in my house, it's kinda outta joint.
listen, rock, you're a very lucky guy.
yeah.
what's happened is freak luck.
freak luck for sure.
look at all them other fighters. real good boys. good records. colorful. fight their hearts out for peanuts -- but who cared? nobody. they got it shoved in their back door. nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
freak luck is a strange thing.
whatta' those?
turtles -- domestic turtles.
i'm here tellin' ya to be very smart with this shot. like the bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
fifty years, huh.
fifty years. the rep is known around philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but i don't have to tell you that.
how 'bout a glass of water?
rocky, d'ya know what i done?
...what?
i done it all. i've done an' seen everything'. believe what i'm tellin' ya -- ya shoulda seen the night in brooklyn, i smacked 'ginny' russo outta the ring, september 14, 1923 -- same night firpo knocked dempsey outta the ring. but who got the press? he did. he had a manager -- september 14, 1923.
ya got a good mind for dates.
nobody ever said that -- there's his picture.
yeah, ya kinda remind me of the rock. ya move like 'im.
really think so?
ya got heart.
heart, but i ain't got no tocker.
respect, i always dished ya respect.
...ya gave dipper my locker.
i'm sorry, i -- i made a mistake. kid, i'm askin' man to man. i wanna be ya manager.
the fight's set -- i don't need a manager.
look, you can't buy what i know. ya can't. i've seen it all! i got pain an' i got experience.
i got pain an' experience too.
please, kid.
whatever i got, i always got on the slide. this shot's no different. i didn't earn nothin' -- i got it on the slide... i needed ya help about ten years ago when i was startin', but ya never helped me none.
if ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? just ask.
i asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- like the bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
rocky, i'm seventy-six years old. maybe you can be the winner i never was -- your shot is my last shot!
how ya feelin'?
...tight.
i got whiskey here.
...no.
if ya don't pay gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?
gazzo's a good man.
how 'bout you talk to 'em about me?  please do me that favor.
keep this job, ya eat better.
y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- ah, doin' good together?
whatta you think?
ain't sure, what's the story?
what?
the story -- what's happenin'?
ya really like her?
sure i like her.
what's the attraction? i don't see it?
i dunno -- she fills gaps.
what gaps?
she got gaps. i got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
you ballin' her?
don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
c'mon, ya screwin' her?
tie it to both ankles -- leave two feet slack.
i never had good footwork.
so much has happened lately -- has it changed your life style much?
...people talk to me more.
how're you preparing for this bicentennial bout?
we can cut that out later. apollo creed says he'll let you stay three rounds before he puts you away.
apollo's a great fighter.
do you feel you have a chance?
maybe --
i'll tear his head off.
do you have anything derogatory to say about the champion?
derogatory? yeah, he's great.
i say ya nothin'!
what's happenin' here?
i'm happenin'! this pig is takin' my shot -- i iz a contender. he's nothin'.
you can forget about sparring, kid.
yo' know i iz the best man here! yo' said so yoself!
why let rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- take a shower, dipper.
don't mouth me, old man, i'll knock yo' out too. c'mon, wop, spar me, let everybody see who's got the heat around here.
yo' yellow, old man.
not yellow, cautious.  see, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
don't you open them anymore?
they either say, 'kill the nigger' or 'hope you die, honky.' -- what ya got in the bag?
like?
sharp -- real nice.

...and he called the reporters --
yeah... threw my whole day off.

yo -- i ain't mad. i'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- they take cheap shots an' paulie knows it.
...are you going to say anything to him?
...what's to say? i dunno what he wants from me --
nothin'! i want nothin' from you!!!
paulie!
shutup! i want nothin' -- i ain't no charity case! get outta my house!
it's not your house --
you ain't no friend no more -- go home! outta my house i want ya!

get outta my life both of ya's.
outta my house i want ya!!
...it's cold outside, paulie.
...paulie. stop now!
i want 'im outta here --  don't think i'm good enough to work for gazzo?  that's what i think of bums like you an' gazzo!  you're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw paulie some crumbs!  i give ya meat, an' i give ya my sister, too!
only a pig would say that!
you forget what i went through to give ya the best.
you gave me what?! knots! you gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
i always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag!
don't do that again!
get away from me -- i could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! so instead i put you two together -- did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- you owe me!
owe you what?
you owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
good? good, paulie?! i've been treatin' you like a baby. since i can't remember it's so long -- i'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up -- and it's you that made me feel like a loser -- that's what ya use to call me 'loser' -- what kind of name is that? so can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when i'm with rocky -- i don't owe you, paulie, you owe me.
you busted?!
what?!
you a virgin? -- ya let 'im in ya pants, didn't ya!  ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!!
...i can't haul meat no more.

what break? huh? what break! who am i to give breaks! i'm a fighter, you haul meat. you do what you do an' i do what i do best -- that's it -- that's life, man!
wanna hear a dirty joke?
...yes --
what cha say, benny -- meet 'the rock.' this is our cutman, benny stein.
yo, benny.
check the eyes, ben.
rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
yeah...
what was that you said about a pet shop?
...what?
what did you say about a pet shop?
i don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
is everything all right?
i gotta go out for a while.
...can't do it.
...what?
...i can't beat him.
apollo?
yeah, i can't beat him.
i been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- he ain't weak nowhere.
what're we going to do?
...i dunno.
oh, rocky -- you worked so hard.
it ain't so bad, 'cause i was a nothin' before --
don't say that.
c'mon, it's true -- but that don't bother me -- i just wanna prove somethin' -- i ain't no bum... it don't matter if i lose... don't matter if he opens my head... the only thing i wanna do is go the distance -- that's all. nobody's ever gone fifteen rounds with creed. if i go them fifteen rounds, an' that bell rings an' i'm still standin', i'm gonna know then i weren't just another bum from the neighborhood...
don't you care what the people will say?
...i'm doin' it for a friend.
whatta you get outta this?
i get the robe an' paulie gets three grand.
...shrewd.
we would like to welcome our viewing audience to the grand world championship bicentennial heavyweight fight -- the first major event of the bicentennial year... a point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. i would like to welcome an old friend, and co-commentator for this evening's event -- jimmy michaels.
thank you, bob. the electricity is everywhere tonight. rocky balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'the fighting style should be 'the caveman against the cavalier.' from the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... his record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
i only wonder if this man has the skill to go past three rounds -- vegas odds say, 'no.'
you could go deaf with the noise -- it undoubtedly means champion apollo creed is heading towards the ring --
am i seeing right? creed is approaching the ring in a boat. is he supposed to be george washington? obviously so.
it's been confirmed that it is definitely an impersonation of george washington -- a great way to start 1976 off.
i agree.
don't let 'im get you tight.
whatta ya think that outfit cost?
god bless ya, rock.
thanks, mick -- i'm gonna try.
the champ stings the slower challenger with jabs at will -- balboa blocks eighty percent of the blows with his face -- creed doesn't look the best he's ever been but is moving smoothly -- creed snaps out a triple combination that backs balboa into a corner -- oh, a solid hook by creed, a master of fist-men.
the champion is smiling and toying with the man -- trying to give the fans their money's worth and make a show of it with the badly out-classes challenger -- another left to right combination. i feel sorry for --
creed is down!!!
how am i doin'?
real good.
see how fast he is -- damn!
breathe deep -- keep ya chin down!! use the legs and drive through 'im. attack -- attack -- attack!
...that boy damn near broke my arm.
sure -- he can hit -- don't play no more -- stick an' move, hear?
i'll carry him 'till the third.
don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- let 'em feel some real heat!
man, i rearranged his face with that right -- the people love what's happenin' tonight.
people nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.
ya nose is broke.
damn! how's it look?
can't hardly tell. don't swallow the blood -- go for his ribs. don't let 'im breathe.
...the guy's great.
why don't ya tell 'im you're a fan!
if you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the champion... most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations. balboa drops beneath a left upper cut and lands a very solid shot on creed's temple -- not much movement from balboa, duck a left, a right, another left and explodes with a right hook to the temple -- i mean explodes. the champ backs off.
there's no way apollo expected this kind of hitting power.
no way -- but the brilliant ability of the champion to master situations like this is one of his most outstanding traits -- creed tosses a perfect right hand that rocks rocky. creed on the offensive -- balboa takes the punishment and counters with a left flush over the heart... that hurt.
...that man's takin' his job too serious.
he's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? don't play -- i know what ya feelin', but don't play.
he got lucky.
luck! you fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad.  more ice, now!
how you holdin' up, kid?
fine... that guy's great.
gimme the water! ya gettin' tagged with his right. i think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- benny, check the eyes! can ya see?
see what?
ya sappin' his strength -- he's losin' steam.
he ain't losin' nothin'.
without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl i have ever seen -- the ringside audience is spotted with blood. this fight should have been stopped rounds ago but rocky balboa refuses to fall --
not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
my side.
get that doctor.
no doctor!
you're hurtin', man!
no doctor!... i'm feelin' good, bro!
wanna keep goin'?
would you keep goin'?
...yeah.
no more, ya wanna lose an eye? no more.
open my eyes -- please, open my eyes!
yo' bleedin' inside, man -- get that doctor.
one more round.
don't kill yourself, man -- let the doctor stop the fight.
...stop jivin'!
cover the ribs -- look here, elbow down, tight -- tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
...thanks.
how i look out there, mick?
great, kid, great.
i don't care what they say, you're a winner.
yo, can i have my locker back?
