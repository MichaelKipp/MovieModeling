hola, juanito
hola, bienvenido
what is this i hear at the airport hammond's not even here?
he sends his apologies.
you are telling me that we are facing a $20 million lawsuit from the family of that injured worker and hammond could not even be bothered to see me?
he had to leave early to be with his daughter.  she is getting a divorce.
i understand that.  I am sorry to hear that. we would be well advised to deal with this situation now.  the insurance company - -
hammond hates inspections.  they slow everything down.
juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  if they pull the funding that is going to slow things down around here.
if two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  i already got ian malcolm, but they think he is too trendy.  they want alan grant.
grant?  you will never get him out of montana.
why not?
because he is like me.  he is a digger.
four complete skeletons. . . . such a small area. . . the same time horizon - -
they died together?
the taphonomy sure looks that way.
if they died together, they lived together. suggests some kind of social order.
a drought.  the lake was shrinking - -
that is good.  that is right!  they died around a dried-up puddle!  without fighting each other.  this is looking good.
postmortem contraction of the posterior neck ligaments.  velociraptor?
yes.  good shape, too.  five, six feet high.  I am guessing nine feet long.  look at the - -
you know, if you really wanted to scare the kid you could have just pulled a gun on him.
yeah, i know, you know...kids.  you want to have one of those?
well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  what is so wrong with kids?
oh, ellie, look.  they are noisy, they are messy, they are sticky, they are expensive.
cheap, cheap, cheap.
they smell.
oh my god, they do not!  they do not smell.
they do smell.  some of them smell.. babies smell.
alright, the one on the airplane had an accident, but usually babies do not smell.
they know very little about the jurassic period they know less about the cretaceous.
the what?
the cretaceous.
anything else, you old fossil?
yeah, plenty.  some of them can not walk!
it frustrates me so much that i love you, that i need to strangle you right now!
hey, we were saving that!
for today, i guarantee it.
and who in god's name do you think you are....?
john hammond.  and i am delighted to finally meet you in person dr grant.
okay, who is the jerk?
uh, this is our paleobotanist, dr ellie.....
sattler.
did i say jerk?
I am sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I am in a hurry. will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
i have samples all over the kitchen.
come along.  i know my way around a kitchen.  come along.
and what are those?
small versions of adults, honey.
not just kids - - for everyone.  we are going to open next year.  unless the lawyers kill me first.  i do not care for lawyers.  you?
i, uh, do not really know any.  we - -
well, I am afraid i do.  there is one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  he represents my investors.  he says they insist on outside opinions.
what kind of opinions?
not to put a fine point on it, your kind.  let's face it, in your particular field, you are the top minds.  if i could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know, give a wee testimonial - - i could get back on schedule - -  - -schedule.
why would they care what we think?
what kind of park is it?
well, it is - - right up your alley.  look, why do not you both  come on down for the weekend.  love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well.  I have got a jet standing by at choteau.
no, I am sorry, that  would not be possible.  we have just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
i could compensate you by fully funding your dig
- - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
for a further three years.
you should not use my name.
dodgson, dodgson.  we got dodgson here!  see, nobody cares.  nice hat. what are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
oh, I will get 'em all.
remember - - viable embryos.  they are no use to us if they do not survive.
how am i supposed to transport them?
what?  no menthol?
mr nedry, mr nedry.  the embryos have to be back here in san jose by then.
that is up to your guy on the boat.  seven of the clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. make sure he got it right.
i was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
i got an eighteen minute window.  eighteen minutes, and your company catches up on ten years of research.
so you two dig up dinosaurs?
try to!
you will have to get use to dr. malcolm!  he suffers from a deplorable excess of personality, especially for a mathematician!
chaotician, actually!  chaotician!
john does not subscribe to chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
codswollop!  ian, you have never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
i certainly have!  very clearly!  because of the behavior of the system in phase space!
a load, if i may say so. of fashionable number crunching, thats all it is!
john, john.
do not do that!
dr. grant, dr. sattler -- you have heard of chaos theory?
no.
no?  non-linear equations?  strange attractions?  dr. sattler, i refuse to believe that you are not familiar with the concept of attraction!
the full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
and the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
let's get something straight, john.  this is not a weekend excursion, this is a serious investigation of the stability of the island.  your investors, whom i represent, are deeply concerned.  forty-eight hours from now, if they - -  - -aren't convinced.  I am not convinced.  and i can shut you down john.
forty-eight hours from now, I will be accepting your apologies.  now get out of the way.  so i can see them!
the movement!
the - - agility.  you are right!
ellie, we can tear up the rule book on cold-bloodedness. it does not apply, they are totally wrong!  this is a warm-blooded creature.  they are totally wrong.
they were wrong.  case closed.  this thing does not live in a swamp to support it is body weight for god's sake!
that thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
the brachiosaur?  thirty.
- - and you are going to sit there and try to tell me it can push blood up a thirty-foot neck without a four-chambered heart and get around like that?!  like that!?  this is like a knockout punch for warm-bloodedness.
we clocked the t-rex at thirty-two miles an hour.
you have got a t-rex!?  he is got a t-rex!  a t-rex!  he said he's- -
say again?
ellie, they are absolutely - - they are moving in herds. they do move in herds!
we were right!
how did you do it?!  how did you do this?!
so what are you thinking?
we are out of a job.
cloning from what?!  loy extraction has never recreated an intact dna strand!
not without massive sequence gaps!
paleo-dna?  from what source?  where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
shhhhh!
this is overwhelming, john.  are these characters  animatronics?
no, we do not have any animatronics here.  these are the real miracle workers of jurassic park.
wait a minute!  how do you interrupt the cellular mitosis?!?
can not we see the unfertilized host eggs?!
can not you stop these things?!
sorry!  it is kind of a ride!
let's get outta here!
john, we - - what I am just saying....
relax donald, relax.  they are scientists.  they ought to be curious.
there you are.  out you come.
oh my god.
could i have a tissue please?
blood temperature feels like high eighties.
wu?
your silence intrigues me.
john, the kind of control you are attempting is not possible.  if there is one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it is that life will not be contained. life breaks free.  it expands to new territories.  it crashes through barriers.  painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
that is right.  will break through.
i get ah - -
i know, it is very exciting.
and scary.
and scary.
when people try to control things that it is out of their power - -
it is anti-nature.
anti-nature.
fascinating animals, fascinating.
oh my god.
give time, they will out draw the t-rex.  guarantee it.
alan, these are not bones anymore.
we are - - still perfecting a viewing system.  the raptors seem to be a bit resistant to integration into a park setting.
robert.  robert muldoon, my game warden from kenya.  bit of an alarmist, I am afraid, but he is dealt with the raptors more than anyone.
alan grant.  tell me, what kind of metabolism do they have?  what is their growth rate?  rate of growth.
yes, yes, yes, which is why we take extreme precautions. they viewing area below us will have eight-inch tempered glass set in reinforced steel frames to - -
do they show intelligence?  with the brain cavity like theirs we assumed - -
they show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. especially the big one.  we bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  that one - -when she looks at you, you can see she is thinking  working things out.  she is the reason we have to feed 'em like this. she had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
the fences are electrified, right?
that is right.  but they never attack the same place twice.  they were testing the fences for weaknesses. systematically.  they remembered.
and we can charge anything we want!  two thousand a day, ten thousand a day - - people will pay it!  and then there is the merchandising - -
donald, this park was not built to carter only to the super rich.  everyone in the world's got a right to enjoy these animals.
sure, they will, they will.  we will have a - - coupon day or something.
- - from combined revenue streams for all three parks should reach eight to nine billion dollars a year - -
that is conservative, of course.  there is no reason to speculate wildly.
I have never been a rich man.  i hear it is nice.  is it nice?
alright donald, alright, but just let him talk.  i want to hear all viewpoints.  i truly do.  i truly am.
do not you see the danger, john, inherent in what you are doing here?  genetic power is the most awesome force ever seen on this planet.  but you wield it like a kid who is found his dad's gun.
you do not give us our due credit.  our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they did not stop to think if they should.  science can create pesticides, but it can not tell us not to use them.  science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can not tell us not to build it!
but this is nature!  why not give an extinct species a second chance?!  i mean, condors. condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I would created a flock of them on the island, you would not be saying any of this!  have anything to say at all!
hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam.  dinosaurs had their shot.  nature selected them for extinction.
i do not understand this luddite attitude, especially from a scientist.  how could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
there is nothing that great about discovery.  what is so great about discovery?  it is a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores.  what you call discovery i call the rape of the natural world!
please - - let's hear something from the others.  dr. grant?  i am sorry - - dr. sattler?
the question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it?  you have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous.  you picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they are living in and will defend themselves.  violently, if necessary.
i do not believe it.  i expected you to come down here and defend me from these characters and the only one I have got on my side it the bloodsucking lawyer!?
thank you.
ah - - they are here.
who?
you four are going to have a little company out in the park.  spend a little time with our target audience. maybe they will help you get the spirit of this place.
what does he mean by "target audience"?
we miss you.
thanks for the presents.
we love the presents.
have a heart gentlemen.  their parents are getting a divorce and they need the diversion.
hey!  where are the brakes?
brakes?  no.  no brakes.  they are electric cars, guided by this track in the roadway, and totally non-polluting, top of the line!
i read your book.
oh, yeah - - great.
because they sure do not look like birds to me.  i heard a meteor hit the earth and made like this one hundred mile crater someplace down in mexico - -
listen, ahh - -
tim.
tim.  which car were you planning on - -
whichever one you are.
why did not i build in orlando?
I will keep an eye on it.  maybe it will swing south like the last one.
ray, start the tour program.
i can not see.
what are we looking for?
dilophosaurus.
oh, shit.
dilophosaurus.
i am totally unappreciated in my time.  we can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  you think that kind of automation is easy? or cheap? you know anybody who can network eight connection machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what i bid this job?  because I would sure as hell like to see them try.
I am sorry about your financial problems.  i really am. but they are your problems.
you are right, john.  you are absolutely right. everything's my problem.
i will not get drawn into another financial conversation with you, dennis.  i really will not.
i do not think there is been any debate.  there is no debate...my mistakes....
i do not blame people for their mistakes, but i do ask that they pay for them.
thanks, dad.
god creates dinosaurs.  god destroys dinosaurs.  god creates man.  man destroys god.  man creates dinosaurs.
dinosaur eats man.  woman inherits the earth.
what is going to happen to the goat?  he is going to eat the goat?!
excellent.
you see?  the tyrannosaur does not obey set patterns or park schedules.  it is the essence of chaos.
I am still not clear on chaos.
it simply deals with unpredictability in complex systems.  it is only principle is the butterfly effect. a butterfly can flap its wings in peking and in central park you get rain instead of sunshine.
uh - - thumb!  the same way.
it changed.  why?  okay, back over your wrist.  because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
alan, listen to this.
- - on your hand, the amount of blood distending in your vessels, imperfections in the skin - -
oh, imperfections?
microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  that is what?
unpredictability....
and even if we have not seen it yet, I am quite sure it is going on in this park right now.
alan?
no one could have predicted dr. grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
alan?
uh - - mr. hammond - -
stop the program!  stop the program!
alan?  where are we going?  you see something?
uh - - anybody else think we should not be out here?
and his book was a lot fatter than yours.
really?
yours was fully illustrated, honey.
anybody at all.  feel free to speak up.
oh ellie.  it is so beautiful.  it is the most beautiful thing i ever saw.
it is my favorite.
imbalance, disorientation, labored breathing.  seems to happen about every six weeks or so.
six weeks?
yes, mitotic, pupils should be constricted.
these are dilated.  take a look.
they are?  I will be damned.
that is pharmacological.  from local plant life.
yes.  we know they are toxic, but the animals do not eat them.
are you sure?
pretty sure.
there is only one way to be positive.  i need to see some droppings.  i have to see the dinosaur's droppings.
you will not be able to miss them.  can not miss them.
dino droppings?
yeah.
that storm center has not dissipated or changed course. we are going to have to cut the tour short, I am afraid. pick it up again tomorrow where we left off.
you are sure we have to?
it is not worth taking the chance, john.
sustain winds 45 knots.
tell them when they get back to the cars.
thanks, steve.
ladies and gentlemen, last shuttle to the dock leaves in approximately five minutes.  drop what you are doing and leave now.
damn!
to grant) she's, uh - - tenacious.
you have no idea.
to ellie) you will remember to wash your hands before you eat anything?
ellie, I have been thinking there is something about the periodicity does not had up.
i know.
these look kind of familiar.
triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
constantly sick.
not just every six weeks.
yeah, i know.
elm that is it, it explains the periodicity, the - -
- - the undigested state of the berries because it is - -
- - totally incidental  unrelated to the feeding pattern - -
- - like birds - -
- - like birds.  what happen is, they swallow the stones and hold them in a muscular sack in their stomachs - -
- - a gizzard - -
- - which is called a gizzard, and it helps them mash their food, but what happens after a while - -
- - what happens is that after a while, the stones get smooth, every six weeks, so the animal regurgitates them - -
- - barfs them up - -
- - and swallows fresh ones.
and when she swallows the stones, she swallows the poison berries too.  that is what makes her sick.  good work tim.
doctors, if you please - - i have to insist we get moving.
oh, you know, if it is alright, I would like to stay with dr. harding and finish with the trike.  is that okay?
sure.  I have got a gas powered jeep.  i can drop her at the visitor's center before i make the boat with the others.
I will catch up with you.  you can go with the others.
are you sure?
I will just finish.  yeah, i want to finish.
i found a way to re-route through the program.  I am turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
rotten luck, this storm.  get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  i do not want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
visitor vehicles are on their way back to the garage.
so how much for our first tour.  two no-shows and one sick triceratops.
it could have been worse, john.  it could have been a lot worse.
you got any kids?
me?  oh, hell yes.  three.  i love 'em.  i love kids.  anything at all can and does happen.
you are married?
occasionally.  always on the lookout for the future ex- mrs. malcolm.
what?
the door security systems are shutting down.
well, nedry said a few systems would go off-line, did not he?
by the way, dr. sattler - she is not like, uh, available, is she? - -
why?
why?  oh, I am sorry.  are you two, uh - - are?  i wish you the best luck.
what did i touch?!
you have not touched  did not touch anything.  we are stopping.  we have stopped.
i must have touched something.  this happens all the time. it must be my fault.  machines hate me.
machines hate you?
yeah, they hate me.
you want to talk about this?
no.
woah, woah, woah, what the hell, what the hell?
what now?
fences are failing, all over the park!  a few minor systems, he said!
find nedry!  check the vending machines!
the monitors are failing.
phones are out too.
where did the vehicles stop?
their radio's out too.  gennaro said to stay put.
the kids okay?
well, i did not ask.  why would not they be?
kids get scared.
what is to be scared about?  it is just a little hiccup in the power.
i did not say i was scared.
i did not say you were scared.
i know.
fine.
up and down, up and down!
i can not believe we invited ian malcolm.
people were gettin' bloody noses - - things on your head - - aneurisms - -
hey!  where did you find those things?
in a box under my seat.
are they heavy?
yeah.
then they are expensive.  put them back.
where does he think he is going?
when you gotta go, you gotta go.
keep absolutely still - - it is vision's based on movement!
you are sure?!
relatively.
I am sorry - - I am sorry - -
turn it off, lex!  turn it off!
i do not know, i do not know.  I am sorry - -
why did you do this?
i do not know!  I am sorry!
oh my god!
we gotta do something.
what?  what can we do?
there is got to be something - -
tim!  lex!
dr. grant!  dr. grant!
are you okay?  can you move?  tim!  are you okay?
tim, are you okay?
I am stuck.  the seat's got my feet!
tim, I will come back for you.  I will get lex out first.
he is knocked out!  he is knocked out!  dr. grant!  dr. grant!  daddy, daddy!
let's get you out.
well?
there is no sign of him anywhere.
are we getting anywhere with these procedures of yours? i mean, what is hanging us up?
i ran a key check on every stroke nedry entered today. it is all pretty standard stuff, until this one - -
what one?
how many lines of code are there?
uh - - about two million.
two million - - great.  that would help.  oh good, that will take no time.
robert - - i wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
sure.
dad - - dad - -
shhh - - I am right here, lex.  I am going to look after you.  I am going to help your brother.  i want you to stay here and wait for me, okay?
he left us!  he left us!
that is not what I am going to do.  good!
i threw up.
that is okay.  listen, give me your hand.
okay, that is not so bad, ah tim?
yes it is.
it is just like coming out of a tree house.  did your dad ever build you a tree house, tim, eh?
no.
me too.  okay.  well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
this is impossible.  how am i going...i can not make it. this is...it's about fifty feet.
so am i going to help you with your foot?
what if the car falls?  what if the wheels fall?
'course you could just wait in there while we go back and get help.
that is a good idea.
you will probably be safe enough  on your own --
i doubt it.
maybe -- it is hard to say.
liar!  you said you would not leave!
I am trying to use psychology to get you out of the drain, you know!
it is safe?
it is safe.
it is safe.
go  that is the way we are going to go.  what do you say?
alright.
can we chance moving him?
please - - chance it.
dr. sattler, I have seen a lot of animal attacks.  people just disappear.  no blood, no trace.  	that's the way it happens.
no, no, no!
ellie, com one!!
the other car!
dr. grant!
alan!
do you see anything?
i do not know.
alan?!
they are not here.
faster, faster!
must go faster, it is getting closer - must go faster!
faster!  shit, shit, shit, faster!
must go faster, go, go.  open it up, 5th gear, 5th gear! here it comes!  stand on it!  fifth - stand on it, 5th gear, go!
hear that?  are you hearing this?
no, i did not hear anything.  no, we are okay.
why are we hurrying if there is nothing wrong?
what if we fall?  i hate trees.
i hate trees!
they do not bother me.
yeah, you were not in that last one.
it is okay to call them brontosaurs, tim.  it is a great name.  it is a romantic name.  it means "thunder lizard".
"thunder lizard!"
no, no, sh, sh, sh - - stop!  stop! stop!  do not let the monsters come over here!
they are not monsters, lex. they are just animals.  and these are herbivores.
that means they only eat vegetables.  but for you, i think they would make an exception.
tim, tim, tim....
oh, i hate the other kind.
they are just doing what they do.  well the other kind - -  - - just do what they do.
dorkatops!
straight-a brainiac!
could you guys possibly cool that for a - -
what are you going to do now if you do not have to dig of dinosaur bones any more?
i guess we will just have to evolve too.
what do you call a blind dinosaur?
i do not know.  what do you call a blind dinosaur?
a do-you-think-he-saurus. what do you call a blind dinosaur's dog?
you got me.
a do-you-think-he-saurus rex.
what if the dinosaur comes back while we are all asleep?
I will stay awake.
all night?
all night.
malcolm's okay for now.  i gave him a shot of morphine.
they will all be fine.  who better to get the children through jurassic park than a dinosaur expert?
carousel.
a carousel - - and a seesaw.  they all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "i see the fleas, mummy!  can not you see the fleas?" clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade...
but with this place, i - - i wanted to give  them something real, something that was not an illusion, something they could see and  touch.  an aim devoid of  merit.
but you can not think through this one.  you have to feel it.
you are absolutely right.  yes, you are right.  hiring nedry was a mistake, that is obvious.  	we're over- dependent on automation, i can see that now.  but that is all correctable for the next time around.
john, john.  john, you are still building onto that flea circus, that illusion.  and now you are adding onto it by what you are doing here.  that is the illusion.
once we have control again we - -
control?!  you never had control!  i was overwhelmed by the power of this place.  so i made a mistake too.  i did not have enough respect for that power, and it is out now.  you are sitting here trying to pick up the pieces. john, there is nothing worth picking up.  the only thing that matters now are the people we love.  alan, lex, and tim.  and john, they are out there where people are dying - - people are dying, you know?
go away!
it is okay!  it is okay!  it is a brachiosaur!
take a bite, take a bite.  I am not letting go.
it is so strong!  look at its nose.  need help?
come on, try some.  take a bite.
it is good protein.  come on, lex.  why do not you touch it?  look at his nose.
this is a seventy-seven ton animal.  come on over, lex! just think of it as a big cow.  look at it is teeth?  come here, girl.  this is a seventy-seven ton animal. just think of it as a big cow!
i like cows.
you are a beautiful big animal.
I am a hacker!
that is what i said!  you are a nerd!  they do not call you people hackers anymore - - they call you people nerds!
hey lex, ahhhchooo!  hey lex, com here.
what?
hey lex, you forgot to say gazundheit.
you know what this is?  it is a dinosaur egg.  the dinosaurs are breeding.
but - - my grandpa said all the dinosaurs were girls.
amphibian dna.
what is that?
well, on the tour - - the film said they used frog dna to fill in the gene sequence gaps.  they mutated the dinosaur's genetic code and blended it with that of frogs.  now, some west african frogs have been known to spontaneously change sex from male to female, in a single sex environment.  malcolm was right!  look, life found a way!
no, no, no, that is crazy, you are out of your mind, he is absolutely out of his mind - -
wait a minute.  what exactly does this mean?
we are talking, my dear, about a calculated risk, which is the only option left to us.  we will never find the command nedry used.  he covered his tracks far too well, and i think it is obvious he is not coming back.  so shutting down the system - -
i will not do it.  you will have to get somebody else, because i will not.
- - shutting down the system is the only way to guarantee wiping out everything he did. if i understand correctly, all the system will come back on their original start-up modes correct?
theoretically, yeah , but we have never shut down the whole system.  it may not come back at all.
but would we get the phones back?
yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
what about the lysine contingency?  we could put that into effect!
what is that?
the lysine contingency - it is intended to prevent the spread of the animals is case they ever got off the island, but we could use it now.  dr. wu inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism. animals can not manufacture the amino acid lysine.  unless they are continually supplied with lysine by us, they will go into a coma and die.
how would we cut off the lysine?
no trick to it.  just stop running the program.  leaving them unattended.
seven days?!  seven days?!  oh, great.  oh good - - clever.
that will - it would be a first; man and dinosaur all die together.  john's plan.
how long will this take?
'bout thirty seconds.
i think perhaps I will just sit down.  i do not suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
you are all right, john you are okay.  it is just you do not have intelligence.  you have "thinktelligence."  you think narrowly and call it "being focused."  you do not see the consequences.  you are very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just do not know the right questions.
yes?
- - shut up.
yes.  it is not a criticism, by the way.
that will teach you to trust grandpa.

why not?
because we are being hunted.  from the bushes straight ahead.
it is all right.
like hell it is!

ellie - - get back and boot up the door locks!
you can not hold it by yourself!
ellie, get the gun!  try to reach the gun!
i can not get it!  i can not get it unless i move!
