what is the story on jimmy gardner?
gardner?  oh, um -- he is a new student. just moved here.  why?
his teacher brought him in to see me. said he would been acting up in class. creating a disturbance.  i could not get a thing out of him.
oh?
what is his family background?
they are from out of state.  father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. i really do not know much about them.
this is a new town for you.  do you like it here?
no.
why not?  moving is hard for anybody.  was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
i do not have many friends.  dad's all the time moving.
can you tell me about that?
son ... are you awake?
yes.
we are going to be moving, son.
do we have to?
i know, son.  but you will like it where we are going.  I am getting a good job.  it is a pretty part of the country.
I will have to go to a new school -- again.
you will meet new friends.  i know ... it is rough.  but i have to move, son.
what is that, dad?
that is the air force base.
wow.  look at the mountains.
this can be your room if you want it. what do you say?
is the hill ours too?
if we want it, it is.
let's check it out, dad.
wow.  there is the town.  and there is the air base.  this is a great hill.
it is got a name.  copper ridge. there used to be a copper mine near here.
let's see what is on the other side. maybe we will find some copper.
a meteorite, dad, look!
it is that time of year again. we should get a pretty good show out here.
why, dad?
because the sky is so clear out here.
there are more this year than last.
this should be the heaviest shower of the year.
there is cassius ...
... and rigel.
and that one -- to the right of rigel?
which one's that?  the dull, red one.
that is mars.  the closest planet to us, now.  that is why it is more than just a point in the sky.
well, come on, you two.  time to go to bed.
mom -- this is the best show all year.
i know.  but you have a full day of school tomorrow --  you, too.
well, son?  should we call it a night?  i for one have had a long day.
okay.
jim -- what is wrong?!
you have got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
it was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
what did it look like?
it was -- it was -- it changed shape. first it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.
are you sure you saw that?  in the rain -- it may have looked like it changed shape --
i do not know, dad.  but it was big.
I will go take a look when the rain lets off.
what do you think he saw?  could it have been something from the air base?
no, mom.  it was not a plane.
are you all right, dad?
sure ... fine.
george, where have you been?
what happened to your other slipper?
i lost it.  it is kind of muddy out there.
was there anything over the hill?
your father asked you a question.
what? -- i...
i have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. this house needs just everything. I will probably be gone all day. jimmy, hurry up and eat or you will be late.
I will take you to school.
you do not have to.  the school bus stops right outside here, at 7:30. I have got to run.
it is probably the solenoid.  take it back to gleason's, they said they would fix it if we found anything wrong.
i will.  but is not that odd -- about my dream ... ?
hi.  sorry I am late.
the back door was open.
what happened to you?  who was that?
that is ed.  ed works with the bell telephone switching division.
where is your car?
i left it at work.
you did?  why? where were you? they said you left hours ago. we were worried.
I am home now.
yes -- but ...
you know, it really is beautiful up there.  let me show you.  we will take a walk after dinner.
george, you are acting very strangely.
mom.  i gotta talk to you.
what?
do not go over the hill, mom. please.
what is wrong, ellen?
it is his nightmare.  he still has not gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
when?
this afternoon.  it is wonderful up there -- you still have not seen the best part.
i have school.
I will pack us a lunch.  hamburgers. you always like that, do not you.
that is quite a story.  you know that, do not you?
yes.
a ufo lands in back of your house and puts something in your dad and mom's necks.  then it gets the police, and your teacher too.
how did it get mrs. mckeltch?
she said the frog came from around the copper ridge.  she must have been behind the hill.
what would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
I would believe him.
why?
'cause he would not lie.
ms. magnuson, is jimmy gardner with you?
why, yes.
jimmy's father is on the phone.  i wonder if you would take the call.
all right.  I will be right back.
hello, this is ms. magnuson speaking.
i understand, miss, that you have my son in your office.
yes, i do, mr. gardner.
may i ask why?
we were having a little talk.
about what?
children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
i do not know what he is told you --  what has he told you?  would you like to tell me -- ?
mr. gardner, i --
you people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. I am of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... what sort of training do you have anyway?
mr. gardner, i do not think this is the place to discuss this matter.
I am not particularly interested, ms. magnuson, in what you think is correct. my wife and i are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want jimmy with us.  keep him in your office until we arrive.
of course.
we will be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
yes, mr. gardner.
do you know how to follow a map?
yes.  i can even read star maps.
this shows how to get to my home. I am giving you back roads and footpaths, so there is less chance of you being seen.
what do you mean -- gone?  what the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
I am sorry, mr. gardner.  i was out of my office for a minute and when i got back -- he was gone.
what did he talk to you about?
he was upset with moving, i believe.
is that all he said?
why, yes.  why?
jimmy, calm down!  what happened? tell me what happened!
i got trapped in mrs. mckeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  i saw them.
where, jimmy?
behind my house, up on the ridge.
if we go and look and there is nothing there, you will have to admit to me that this is all in your mind.
this is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
i do not see anything.
no, but it was here.
i swear it was here.
but it is not, jimmy.
no.
let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.
they will get us.
we will be very careful.  but we have to see.  if something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. would not there?
does it look to you like anything landed here?
maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
stay here.  I am going to make a phone call.
who are you calling?
the state police.
did you call the state police?
all their lines were busy.
no one comes here after dark.
hide the car.
damn.
i know a way.
what is it?
i do not know.  i do not know what I am doing here --
but you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
yes ... yes, but I am not sure what i saw anymore.
do not go in.
I am not.  they must be tunneling under the whole town.
we can not do this alone.  we have got to get help.
there was a man named colonel wilson, from the air force base.  he was talking in our class.  he said we could visit him any time we wanted.  I will bet he could do something.
let's try.
you are looking for life?
they did not find any signs of life on the viking missions.
i had an awful dream.
what, jim, what?
first lemme look at your necks.
... and then everything blew up. and then i woke up.
that is a doozy of a dream, son.
it was so real, dad.
it was all made of stuff that is happened to you in the last few days.  the sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you do not know them ...
it is all this moving from place to place.  we are never settled.  I am having nightmares myself.
what kind, mom?
oh, i can not remember.  but people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed.
i know, ellen.  we will settle down soon.
i was so scared.
better now, son?
better get some sleep, son, or you will be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
good night.
