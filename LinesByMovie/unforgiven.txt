...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?
hell, you know how skinny is. says he is going to shoot 'em... an i says, "skinny, you can not do that," an' he says, "well, then get little bill down here an' let's settle this" an' i says, "bill's sleepin', skinny," an'...
she is going to live.  she did not steal nothin', she did not touch his poke.
no?
all she done was... when she seen he had a teensy little pecker... she gave a giggle. that is all. she did not know no better.
a whippin'? that is all they get? after what they done?
whippin' am not a little thing, alice.
but what they done, they...
shut up, alice. little bill, a whippin' am not going to settle this.
no?
this here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' delilah fitzgerald, the cut-whore. now i brung her clear from boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' i got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
property.
damaged property. like if i was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
you figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
hell no. leastways, they will not pay to do it.
she could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's going to pay good money for a cut-up whore.
you boys are off of the spade outfit. got your own string of ponies?
i could not find no bullwhips, bill. the german...
do not matter, we do not need no whips.  spring comes an' skinny do not have them ponies, I am gonna...
you... you am not even gonna... whip 'em?
i fined 'em instead.
for what they done? skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
am not you seen enough blood for one night? hell, alice, they am not loafers nor tramps nor bad men. they are hard workin' boys that was foolish. why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
like whores?
william munny, yeah.
same one as shot charlie pepper in lake county?
what is it, son?
two more hogs got the fever.
you shot charlie pepper, did not you? and you are the one killed william harbey an' robbed the train over...
hold on, mister.  son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. penny, you give yer brother a hand...
you are pete sothow's nephew, huh? hell, i thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' i done in the old days.
i could of... easy.
yeah, i guess so.
like i was sayin' you do not look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
maybe i ain't.
well, uncle pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if i ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. meanin' the best. on account of you are cold as snow an' do not have no weak nerve nor fear.
he said that, huh?
I am a damn killer myself, only i am not killed so many as you because of my youth. schofield kid, they call me.
schofield? you from schofield?
on account of my schofield model smith and wesson pistol.
oh.
well, how about it?
about what?
bein' my partner. I am headin' north up around the niobrara in nebraska. going to kill a couple of no good cowboys.
what for?
for cuttin' up a lady. they cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
jesus!
thousand dollars of reward. five hundred a piece.
i am not like that no more, kid. whiskey done it as much as anythin' i guess.  i am not touched a drop in ten years. my wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.
well... you do not look so prosperous. hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. we could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
she is passed on, kid.
huh?
been gone near three years now.
oh.
do not tell nobody about the reward an' all. do not need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.
i do not never see nobody anyhow.
if you was to change your mind, might be you could catch me... due west to the western trail an' north to ogallala.
who is he?
best we move that pig.
where did you get the money, huh?
we am not got it. we am not got no money.
you told them cowboys you had it.
we was... lyin'.
what you going to do when somebody comes to collect?  fuck 'em? fuck 'em a thousand times?  the kind of people who will come after that thousand, they will not tolerate if you do not have it. they will not just cut your face up a little.  stupid cunts!
hit your finger, huh?
huh? hullo, skinny. snuck up on me.  how do you like her?
heard you done the roof yourself.
roof? jesus, skinny, i done practically every damn thing myself. roberts boy hauled wood, that is all.
what is all that wood?
porch. I am puttin' a porch on her so's i can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
yeah?
them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
shit, skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re going to be the first of the billiard barons.
...they been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they are payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up delilah.
an' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to kansas an' cheyenne?
yup.
all week?
i did not hear nothin' till last night.
word must have got all the way to texas by now.
oh, shit, bill, i guess nobody's going to come clear from texas.
they really got all that money, them whores?
you know how women kin lie... i knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they do not have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. maybe.
that much, huh?
you could run off them two cowboys.
i could run off them whores.
well, i guess they will just up an' run anyhow, them two.
nope. they will stay out on the spade country where they got friends.
we am not bad men no more, bill. hell, we are farmers.
should be easy killin' em... supposin' they do not run off to texas first.
how long since you shot a gun at a man?  nine... ten years?
eleven.
easy, huh? hell, i do not know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... i could see shootin' 'em...
we done stuff before for money, ned.
well, we thought we was doin' it for money...  what did they do anyhow? cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
cut up a woman. cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, i guess.
well, i guess they got it comin'...  but you would not go if claudia was alive.
how long you gonna be, bill?
two weeks, i guess.
this kid, what is he like?
three ways?
yup. you still got the spencer rifle?
yeah, an' i could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
he musta been movin' right along.
we will come across him tomorra, i guess.
got used to my bed. am not going to feel to home out here.
well, it am not just the bed I am going to miss. i'm...  hell, billy, I am sorry. i did not mean...
it am not nothin', do not fret it.  she do not like it much, you goin' off with me.
sally?
she gave me the evil eye.
it is just... she is a indian an' indians ain't... overfriendly.
i am not blamin' her, ned, i am not holdin' it against her.  she knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch i was... an' she will not allow how I have changed. she just do not know how i am not like that no more.
well, she...
i am not the same, ned. claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. us goin' to do this killin'... that do not mean I am back to like i was. i just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  remember that drover, the one i shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? i dream about him now an' again. i did not have no reason to shoot him... not one i could remember when i sobered up.
you was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
nobody liked me... none of the boys. they was scared of me... figured i might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
you am not like that no more.
eagle... he hated my guts. bonaparte did not like me none.
nor quincy, i guess.
quincy, he was always watchin' me. scared.
you am not like that no more.
hell, no. I am just a fella now. am not no different from anyone else no more.
where is little bill for christ sake?
ha. he was building his fucking porch.
building his porch!
he is coming am not he?
'course he is coming.
what did he say?
little bill? he did not say nothing. like i said, he was buildin' his porch. have you seen that thing?
he did not say nothin', huh?
asked what they looked like, that is all. christ, maybe he is tough but he sure am not no carpenter.
maybe he am not so tough.
we never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
little bill come out of kansas an' texas, boys. he worked them tough towns.
just wondered. anybody could be scared.
why, if you were to point a pistol at a king or a queen, sir, i can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...
i would not point no pistol at nobody, sir.
a wise policy. but if you did, i can assure you, the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand... in awe.  whereas, a president... i mean, why not shoot a president?
now this strawberry alice person, tell me again.
down the street and across. greely's beer garden and billiard parlor. just ask for alice and say you want a game of billiards.
billiards, eh? even though i do not really wish to play?
do not matter. they burned the table in '78 for firewood.
ah, i see.
hullo, bob. boys, this here is english bob.
shit and fried eggs.
been a long time, bob. you run out of chinamen?
little bill, i thought you were dead. i see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
well, i was always tasting the soup two hours after i et it.
what i heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.
i heard that one myself, bob. hell, i even thought i was dead til i found out it was just i was in nebraska.  who is your friend?
ww beauchamp... little bill daggett and... "friends."
you work for the railroads too, mister beauchamp?
n-no. i wr-wr-wr-write... i wr- wrwrite...
letters?
books. he is my biographer.
oh.
it is only a b-b-b-book...
a book, huh?  i guess that means you can read... an' i guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... but then, like you told old andy there, you am not armed, are you, bob?
not really...  maybe a couple of peacemakers...  i imagine you could overlook those, eh, bill? if you did not see them... or hear them?
i guess not, bob. i do not like guns around.
charley, see what kind of "books" mister beauchamp is packing... but watch you do not get wet.
be careful with those, sonny.
the... duck of death.
d-d-d-duke. the d-d-duke of death.
you leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
enemies, bob? you been talking about the queen again? on independence day?
say, bill... you ever... ever go into town... an' all?
sure, i got to. got to get supplies.
no. i mean...  ...an' get yourself a woman? you know?
naw. naw, i do not ever go into town for that.  a man like me... a man like me can not get no woman but one he is going to pay for... an' that am not right... buyin' flesh.  claudia, god rest her soul, she would not have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all.
whaddaya do, just use your hand?
sometimes... yeah.  i do not miss it all that much.
some fucker's shootin' at us.
yeah.
he hit you?
naw. i bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
he am not shootin' our way no more.  he is shootin' over that way. who is he shootin' at over that way?
beats the hell out of me.
you suppose maybe we are in somebody is field?
i did not see nothin' planted.
hey.
you are marking us, bill.
hey, kid.
kid? the kid's shootin at us?
is that you, kid?
why would the kid shoot at us?
hey kid, it is me, bill munny.
what was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
thought you was followin' me.
well, we was. like you said, i changed my mind an'...
was not nothin' said about no partner.
well, this here's ned logan... ned, this here's the schofield kid, nephew of pete sothow an'...
i seen two fellas followin' me, i guessed they come to kill me.  we did not talk about no other fella.
well, now kid, there is two of these cowboys, am not that so? better there is three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. maybe...
i was going to kill them two by myself. it do not take three.
now ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
better'n you anyhow, kid. you was not comin' close.
i was only checkin' it for you. thought maybe somethin' was bent.
nothin's bent.
well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
you gonna share your half with him?
three ways, i figured.
no.
sorry, ned. guess i wasted your time. see ya, kid!
you are goin' back with him?
he is my partner. he do not go, i don't.
what the hell are you pissin' about, I would like to know?
huh?
well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
lookin' at?
clouds, kid. we was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
oh, them.  hell, i seen them.
you was right to change your mind, kid.
yeah?
I am a damn good shot.  see that hawk up there? i could kill that hawk with one shot.
shit.
how far kin you see?
far enough.
we am not goin' to nebraska on no turtle hunt. a hundred yards?
more.
see that scrub oak yonder?
fuck you.
he is blind, for chri...
i am not blind, you asshole.
now hold on, boys, hold on. now, kid, you kin see fifty yards, can not you?
bet your ass i kin see fifty yards an' i kin shoot this sonofabitch...
easy, kid, easy.  now, you hear that, ned? the kid can see fifty yards fine, hear?
jesus.
fifty yards am not bad.  guess we better get along.
that is you there, am not it, bob? the duck of death?
uh... duke.
uh... it's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
well, mister beauchamp... from what i read of this here book, I would have to say the writin' am not a whole lot different from the pitcher.
uh... i can assure you, mister daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
meaning the duck himself, i guess.
duke.
duck, i says.  "you have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, corcoran," said the duck. "you must apologize." but two gun corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but the duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns."
i believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
well, mister beauchamp, i was at the blue bottle saloon in wichita the night english bob killed corky corcoran... an' i did not see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
you were there?
first off... corky did not carry two pistols, though he should of.
but he was called...
some folks did call old corky "two gun" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that walker colt he carried. an' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some french lady that old bob was sweet on... well, one day corky walked into the blue bottle and before he knows what is happening bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he is drunker than hell.
well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked corky, an' he done the wrong thing! pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. meantime, bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he is so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. well, now the duck of death is good as dead 'cause this time corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
and?
bam! that walker colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. now if corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
you... you mean...  english bob killed him while...?
well he was not going to wait for corky to grow no new hand. he walked over real close, bein' drunk, an' shot him through the liver.
i give it up 'cause i hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back...  shit, i sure do miss my fuckin' bed.
yeah... you said that last night.
last night i said i missed my fuckin' wife... tonight i just miss my fuckin' bed.
say, bill. that business in jackson county... did that really happen? i mean how they say it happened?
what business?
an' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  uncle pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
well... i do not recollect.
you do not recollect!
say, ned... ?
yeah.
how many men you killed?  am not you going to answer?
i do not like the question.
well, i got to know what kind of fellas I am ridin' with, do not i? in case of a scrape.
how many you killed, kid?
five. i killed five of 'em.  that counts a mexican i killed.  he come at me with a knife.
get some sleep, kid.
you boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
but if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
he will be hurryin' and he will miss. that there is as fast as i can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it is a barn.
but... if he does not miss?
then he will kill you. that is why there are so few dangerous men like old bob there... an' like me. it am not so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it will unnerve most fellas.  look here, let me show you somethin'.  see this here pistol?
them's the keys. all you got to do is shoot me an' you an' english bob can ride out free as birds.
is... is it... loaded?
would not be no good if it wasn't. you got to cock it though.
r-r-r-really? you r-r-really w- wwant...?
give it to him.
i brung this for when we had to kill them fellows.  i guess we could use some now.
not for me. i do not touch it no more.
god damn it, bill, it is rainin'.
i know it is rainin',  give the kid a drink, why dontcha?
no.
what he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' pete...
yeah?
i remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
well, i am not like that no more, ned. i am not no crazy, killin' fool.
you still think it will be easy shootin' them cowboys?
mmmm pistols.
oh yeah.
rain's coming.
thank god.
"well, jim," i says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."
did you... kill him?
no,... but i can not abide them kind... an' you will find a lot of them in the saloons... tramps an' drunk teamsters an' crazy miners... sportin' pistols like they was bad men, but not having no sand nor character... not even bad character.
i do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend english bob... but bob am not no coward who will cry to your face an' then...
uh... sheriff... uh...
huh? oh.  another one, huh? shit, i guess I am clean out of receptacles.
maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
what?
uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. i...
you... you remember eagle hendershot?
huh? uh... yeah.
i seen him.
he is dead, bill.
his head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
jesus, bill, you got fever. take a drink, will you?
worms was comin' out.
listen, bill, I am going to see what is takin' the kid so long. must be he is gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
uh, no. no, i am not drunk.
ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the county office day or night. i guess you did not read it with the weather an' all.
well... uh... i... i am not got no, uh, firearms.
them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
i... dunno. i mean, i guess not. no, they am not carryin' no guns.
you are spillin' your whiskey, mister.
like i said, i...
what is your name?
uh, william... uh... hendershot.
well, mister hendershot, if i was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if i was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, i guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, am not that so?
i... i guess i might... but like i said, i am not armed.
i guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
uh... yeah. yeah.
there am not no snakes in here, mister hendershot.
well, uh... it am not loaded.
if they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
on account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
you just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
innocent of what?
jesus.  you done this before?
plenty of times.
his pistol must of jammed.
move the candle closer, i can not see.
he would not of took no beating like that if it had not of jammed. he would not just give it over an' not shoot no one.
he did not even pull his pistol, huh?
he am not as tough as you, kid.
well, i guess i woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
shit, kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
that was your idea, i wanted to...
we are going to need more food... at least three days worth...
three days? we could kill 'em tomorrow.
i do not kill nobody without him.
we do not need him. the two of us could do it.
depends what he told you.  about bill, you mean?
all of it. about him, an' you an' uncle pete... about robbin' the rock island pacific... an' about them missouri banks.
we done that stuff.
well i guess bill munny was not no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.
claudia... am not here, bill.
ned... is that you, ned?  ned, i seen... death.
easy, bill.
i seen the angel of death ned, an' i seen the river.  he is a snake, he got... snake eyes.

he is going to die, am not he?
maybe.
well, suppose he does?
we will bury him.
that am not what i mean.
you mean, am i gonna help you kill them cowboys?
i can not spot 'em myself but you could. that red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, i bet.
an' if i spot 'em?
I will ride up close an' shoot 'em!
just like that?
i told you I am a damn killer. i done it before.  I am more killer than him.
yeah?
hell, yeah.
i thought... you was an angel.
you am not dead.
some big guy beat the shit out of me.  i guess i must look a lot like you, huh?
you do not look nothin' like me, mister.
i did not mean no offense.  i guess you are the one them cowboys cut up.  ned an' the kid, my partners, are they... ?
they went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
scouting?
on the bar t... looking for... them.
oh. how long i been here?
three days. are you hungry?

i... i guess not.  i did not mean i did not want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. i did not mean that.
you are a beautiful woman an'... if i was to want a free one, i guess I would want you more than them others. it ain't... see... i can not have no free one on account of my wife...
your wife?
yeah. see?
i admire that, you being true to your wife. I have seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.

you are going to lose your share. if you don't...
shut up, kid.
me an' the kid, we will head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we will shoot him. then we will come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head south together.
supposin' he do not go to the ranch?
I will bet anything he will not go to town nor he will not ride out on the range. right off he will hole up at the ranch.
i am not waitin', bill.  I will look in on your youngsters when i get back.
ned, do not pay no mind to what the kid said about the money. I will bring your share along, hear? the kid's full of shit, hear?
i did not think they would really do it.
what did you think, they come clear up from kansas to fuck us?
that kid... he is just a... boy. and that other one, bill, being true to his wife...

how i said i shot five men... it was not true.  that mexican... the one that come at me with a knife... i busted his leg with a shovel... i did not shoot him or nothin'.
well, that fella today, you shot him alright.
h-hell yeah. i killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
take a drink, kid.
oh ch-ch-christ... it don't... it do not seem... real... how he's... dead... how he am not going to breathe no more... n-n-never. or the other one neither... on account of... of just... pullin' a trigger.
it is a hell of a thing, am not it, killin' a man. you take everythin' he is got... an' everythin' he is ever going to have...
well, i gu-guess they had it... comin'.
we all got it comin', kid.
i was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
silky an' faith, they rode off to the east an' two deputies was followin' them.
i trust you, bill.
well, you do not wanna trust me too much. we will take ned his share together so you do not figure i run off with it.
ned's share?
yeah, he went south ahead of us. i guess we will catch him before...
he's... he is dead.
no he ain't. he went south yesterday.
they... they killed him. i... thought you know that. i thought you knew because...
nobody did not kill ned, he went south yesterday. he did not even kill nobody. why would anybody kill ned?
who killed him?
little bill. the... the bar t boys caught him and little bill...
he hanged him?  shot him down?
n-no. he... he beat him up. he was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... ned just died.  little bill did not mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
good example! good example of what I would like to know? he did not even kill nobody... he could not do it no more.
they got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
a sign on him?
in front of greely's. it says, "this here is what happens to..."
they got a sign on him in front of greely's?
the questions little bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
about where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
what did ned say?
l-lies... at first. about how you was just passin' through and did not kill nobody... an' little bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he would beat on ned an' ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
then... what?
a cowboy come in sayin' you killed quick mike in the shit house at the bar t...
an' little bill killed ned for what i done?
not on purpose. but he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. first ned would not say nothin'... but little bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
he said how you was really three fingered jack out of missouri... an' bill said "same three fingered jack that dynamited the rock island and pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" an' ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than william bonney or clay alisson or the james brothers an' how if he hurt ned again you was going to come an' kill him like you killed a u.s. marshall in '73.
did not scare little bill though, did it?
n-no, sir?
lemmee see that schofield, kid.
wha... what f-for?
lemmee see it.
sure. sure, bill.
you... gonna take... the money?
you better get on back, miss.
you could have it. all of it.
i thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
I would rather be blind and ragged than dead, i guess.
this here money, take my share an' ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. tell 'em half goes to sally two trees if i am not back in a week. the rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
are you... are you gonna... kill little bill?
i guess you will not mind my keepin' the bottle.
you are going to kill him, am not you?
stay clear of folks you might see. there is plenty out lookin' to hang you. go on now, skedaddle.
he should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
i guess you are three-fingered jack out of missouri, killer of women and children.
i have done that... killed women and children... i have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now i have come to kill you, little bill, for what you done to ned.  now step aside. boys.
i... i... think i'm... shot.
you am not shot.
p-p-p-please, I am not armed.  m-m-my g-god. you killed... little bill.
you sure you am not armed?
i never c-c-carry arms. i'm... a writer.
a writer? what do you write... letters an' such?
b-b-books.  you... you killed five men... singlehanded.
yeah.
wh-wh-who did you kill first?
huh?
wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
yeah?
i was lucky in the order.  i always been lucky killin' folks.
who was next? clyde? or was it...?
i could tell you who was last, mister.
i don't... deserve this... to die this way. i was... building a house.
"deserve" do not mean shit, little bill.
I will see you... in hell, you three fingered asshole.
hullo, paw.
i guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
three.
three? that am not bad considerin'.
that fella come by... tom.
tom?
the one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
the kid, yeah...
only he was not carryin' no pistol this time.
he say anythin'... the kid... ?
tom? only how... how if you didn't... did not come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to sally an' say you was...
well, i come back, did not i?
did you... did you... ?
did i what?
all that money... i mean... did you...?
steal it? naw, i did not steal it.
no... i meant...
what?
k-k-kill somebody?
who said that?
n-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
before i met your maw, god rest her soul, it used to be i was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. only she made me see the error of my ways an'... i am not like i was no more.
i guess you did not kill nobody then.
naw, son, i did not kill nobody.
