...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?
hell, you know how skinny is. says he's gonna shoot 'em... an i says, "skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "well, then get little bill down here an' let's settle this" an' i says, "bill's sleepin', skinny," an'...
she's gonna live.  she didn't steal nothin', she didn't touch his poke.
no?
all she done was... when she seen he had a teensy little pecker... she gave a giggle. that's all. she didn't know no better.
a whippin'? that's all they get? after what they done?
whippin' ain't a little thing, alice.
but what they done, they...
shut up, alice. little bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
no?
this here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' delilah fitzgerald, the cut-whore. now i brung her clear from boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' i got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
property.
damaged property. like if i was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
you figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
hell no. leastways, they won't pay to do it.
she could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.
you boys are off of the spade outfit. got your own string of ponies?
i couldn't find no bullwhips, bill. the german...
don't matter, we don't need no whips.  spring comes an' skinny don't have them ponies, i'm gonna...
you... you ain't even gonna... whip 'em?
i fined 'em instead.
for what they done? skinny gets some ponies an' that's...?
ain't you seen enough blood for one night? hell, alice, they ain't loafers nor tramps nor bad men. they're hard workin' boys that was foolish. why if they was given over to wickedness in a regular way...
like whores?
william munny, yeah.
same one as shot charlie pepper in lake county?
what is it, son?
two more hogs got the fever.
you shot charlie pepper, didn't you? and you're the one killed william harbey an' robbed the train over...
hold on, mister.  son, this here pig gotta be moved outta this pen, away from them others. penny, you give yer brother a hand...
you're pete sothow's nephew, huh? hell, i thought maybe you was someone come to kill me...  ...for somethin' i done in the old days.
i could of... easy.
yeah, i guess so.
like i was sayin' you don't look like no meaner than hell cold-blooded damn killer.
maybe i ain't.
well, uncle pete said you was the goddamndest meanest sonofabitch ever lived an' if i ever wanted a partner for a killin', you was the worst one. meanin' the best. on account of you're cold as snow an' don't have no weak nerve nor fear.
he said that, huh?
i'm a damn killer myself, only i ain't killed so many as you because of my youth. schofield kid, they call me.
schofield? you from schofield?
on account of my schofield model smith and wesson pistol.
oh.
well, how about it?
about what?
bein' my partner. i'm headin' north up around the niobrara in nebraska. gonna kill a couple of no good cowboys.
what for?
for cuttin' up a lady. they cut up her face an' cut her eyes out, cut her ears off an' her tits too.
jesus!
thousand dollars of reward. five hundred a piece.
i ain't like that no more, kid. whiskey done it as much as anythin' i guess.  i ain't touched a drop in ten years. my wife, she cured me of it... cured me of drink an' wickedness.
well... you don't look so prosperous. hell, you could buy her a new dress out of your half. we could kill them two an' you could buy your wife one of them fancy...
she's passed on, kid.
huh?
been gone near three years now.
oh.
don't tell nobody about the reward an' all. don't need no other gunmen tryin' to collect.
i don't never see nobody anyhow.
if you was to change your mind, might be you could catch me... due west to the western trail an' north to ogallala.
who's he?
best we move that pig.
where'd you get the money, huh?
we ain't got it. we ain't got no money.
you told them cowboys you had it.
we was... lyin'.
what you gonna do when somebody comes to collect?  fuck 'em? fuck 'em a thousand times?  the kind of people who'll come after that thousand, they won't tolerate if you don't have it. they won't just cut your face up a little.  stupid cunts!
hit your finger, huh?
huh? hullo, skinny. snuck up on me.  how do you like her?
heard you done the roof yourself.
roof? jesus, skinny, i done practically every damn thing myself. roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
what's all that wood?
porch. i'm puttin' a porch on her so's i can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
yeah?
them whores, they been fuckin' an' fuckin' all them cowboys that come into town the last two weeks...
shit, skinny, we got railroad barons an' cattle barons, but you' re gonna be the first of the billiard barons.
...they been fuckin' 'em, 'an tellin' every bow-legged one of 'em how they're payin' a thousand dollars to whatever sonofabitch kills them two boys which cut up delilah.
an' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to kansas an' cheyenne?
yup.
all week?
i didn't hear nothin' till last night.
word must have got all the way to texas by now.
oh, shit, bill, i guess nobody's gonna come clear from texas.
they really got all that money, them whores?
you know how women kin lie... i knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. maybe.
that much, huh?
you could run off them two cowboys.
i could run off them whores.
well, i guess they'll just up an' run anyhow, them two.
nope. they'll stay out on the spade country where they got friends.
we ain't bad men no more, bill. hell, we're farmers.
should be easy killin' em... supposin' they don't run off to texas first.
how long since you shot a gun at a man?  nine... ten years?
eleven.
easy, huh? hell, i don't know that it was all that easy then... an' we was young an' full of beans.  bill... if you was mad at 'em... if they done you wrong... i could see shootin' 'em...
we done stuff before for money, ned.
well, we thought we was doin' it for money...  what'd they do anyhow? cheat at cards, steal some strays, spit on a rich fella?
cut up a woman. cut her eyes out, cut her tits off, cut her fingers off... done everythin' but cut up her cunny, i guess.
well, i guess they got it comin'...  but you wouldn't go if claudia was alive.
how long you gonna be, bill?
two weeks, i guess.
this kid, what's he like?
three ways?
yup. you still got the spencer rifle?
yeah, an' i could still hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
he musta been movin' right along.
we'll come across him tomorra, i guess.
got used to my bed. ain't gonna feel to home out here.
well, it ain't just the bed i'm gonna miss. i'm...  hell, billy, i'm sorry. i didn't mean...
it ain't nothin', don't fret it.  she don't like it much, you goin' off with me.
sally?
she gave me the evil eye.
it's just... she's a indian an' indians ain't... overfriendly.
i ain't blamin' her, ned, i ain't holdin' it against her.  she knew me back then... an' she seen what a no good sonofabitch i was... an' she won't allow how i've changed. she just don't know how i ain't like that no more.
well, she...
i ain't the same, ned. claudia, she... straightened me up, got me clear of the whiskey an' all. us goin' to do this killin'... that don't mean i'm back to like i was. i just need the money... for a new start... for them youngsters.  remember that drover, the one i shot in the mouth so's the teeth come out the back of his head? i dream about him now an' again. i didn't have no reason to shoot him... not one i could remember when i sobered up.
you was a... a crazy sonofabitch.
nobody liked me... none of the boys. they was scared of me... figured i might shoot 'em out of pure meanness.
you ain't like that no more.
eagle... he hated my guts. bonaparte didn't like me none.
nor quincy, i guess.
quincy, he was always watchin' me. scared.
you ain't like that no more.
hell, no. i'm just a fella now. ain't no different from anyone else no more.
where's little bill for christ sake?
ha. he was building his fucking porch.
building his porch!
he's coming ain't he?
'course he's coming.
what'd he say?
little bill? he didn't say nothing. like i said, he was buildin' his porch. have you seen that thing?
he didn't say nothin', huh?
asked what they looked like, that's all. christ, maybe he's tough but he sure ain't no carpenter.
maybe he ain't so tough.
we never seen him up against any... like these ones... killers.
little bill come out of kansas an' texas, boys. he worked them tough towns.
just wondered. anybody could be scared.
why, if you were to point a pistol at a king or a queen, sir, i can assure you your hand would shake as though palsied...
i wouldn't point no pistol at nobody, sir.
a wise policy. but if you did, i can assure you, the sight of royalty would cause you to dismiss all thoughts of bloodshed and stand... in awe.  whereas, a president... i mean, why not shoot a president?
now this strawberry alice person, tell me again.
down the street and across. greely's beer garden and billiard parlor. just ask for alice and say you want a game of billiards.
billiards, eh? even though i don't really wish to play?
don't matter. they burned the table in '78 for firewood.
ah, i see.
hullo, bob. boys, this here is english bob.
shit and fried eggs.
been a long time, bob. you run out of chinamen?
little bill, i thought you were dead. i see you shaved off your chin whiskers.
well, i was always tasting the soup two hours after i et it.
what i heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.
i heard that one myself, bob. hell, i even thought i was dead til i found out it was just i was in nebraska.  who's your friend?
ww beauchamp... little bill daggett and... "friends."
you work for the railroads too, mister beauchamp?
n-no. i wr-wr-wr-write... i wr- wrwrite...
letters?
books. he's my biographer.
oh.
it's only a b-b-b-book...
a book, huh?  i guess that means you can read... an' i guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... but then, like you told old andy there, you ain't armed, are you, bob?
not really...  maybe a couple of peacemakers...  i imagine you could overlook those, eh, bill? if you didn't see them... or hear them?
i guess not, bob. i don't like guns around.
charley, see what kind of "books" mister beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet.
be careful with those, sonny.
the... duck of death.
d-d-d-duke. the d-d-duke of death.
you leave me at the mercy of my enemies.
enemies, bob? you been talking about the queen again? on independence day?
say, bill... you ever... ever go into town... an' all?
sure, i got to. got to get supplies.
no. i mean...  ...an' get yourself a woman? you know?
naw. naw, i don't ever go into town for that.  a man like me... a man like me can't get no woman but one he's gonna pay for... an' that ain't right... buyin' flesh.  claudia, god rest her soul, she wouldn't have wanted me doin' nothin' like that, me bein' a father, an' all.
whaddaya do, just use your hand?
sometimes... yeah.  i don't miss it all that much.
some fucker's shootin' at us.
yeah.
he hit you?
naw. i bumped my head fallin' off of my horse.
he ain't shootin' our way no more.  he's shootin' over that way. who's he shootin' at over that way?
beats the hell out of me.
you suppose maybe we're in somebody's field?
i didn't see nothin' planted.
hey.
you're marking us, bill.
hey, kid.
kid? the kid's shootin at us?
is that you, kid?
why would the kid shoot at us?
hey kid, it's me, bill munny.
what was you shootin' at us for, anyhow?
thought you was followin' me.
well, we was. like you said, i changed my mind an'...
wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
well, this here's ned logan... ned, this here's the schofield kid, nephew of pete sothow an'...
i seen two fellas followin' me, i guessed they come to kill me.  we didn't talk about no other fella.
well, now kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. maybe...
i was gonna kill them two by myself. it don't take three.
now ned's a hell of a shot with a rifle. hell, he can hit a bird in the eye flyin'.
better'n you anyhow, kid. you wasn't comin' close.
i was only checkin' it for you. thought maybe somethin' was bent.
nothin's bent.
well, you was shootin' every which way an'...
you gonna share your half with him?
three ways, i figured.
no.
sorry, ned. guess i wasted your time. see ya, kid!
you're goin' back with him?
he's my partner. he don't go, i don't.
what the hell are you pissin' about, i'd like to know?
huh?
well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
lookin' at?
clouds, kid. we was lookin' at them clouds on account of we got a storm ridin' up our ass.
oh, them.  hell, i seen them.
you was right to change your mind, kid.
yeah?
i'm a damn good shot.  see that hawk up there? i could kill that hawk with one shot.
shit.
how far kin you see?
far enough.
we ain't goin' to nebraska on no turtle hunt. a hundred yards?
more.
see that scrub oak yonder?
fuck you.
he's blind, for chri...
i ain't blind, you asshole.
now hold on, boys, hold on. now, kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
bet your ass i kin see fifty yards an' i kin shoot this sonofabitch...
easy, kid, easy.  now, you hear that, ned? the kid can see fifty yards fine, hear?
jesus.
fifty yards ain't bad.  guess we better get along.
that is you there, ain't it, bob? the duck of death?
uh... duke.
uh... it's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
well, mister beauchamp... from what i read of this here book, i'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.
uh... i can assure you, mister daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
meaning the duck himself, i guess.
duke.
duck, i says.  "you have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, corcoran," said the duck. "you must apologize." but two gun corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but the duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns."
i believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
well, mister beauchamp, i was at the blue bottle saloon in wichita the night english bob killed corky corcoran... an' i didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no twogun shooters nor nothin' like that.
you were there?
first off... corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
but he was called...
some folks did call old corky "two gun" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that walker colt he carried. an' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some french lady that old bob was sweet on... well, one day corky walked into the blue bottle and before he knows what's happening bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he's drunker than hell.
well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked corky, an' he done the wrong thing! pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. meantime, bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. well, now the duck of death is good as dead 'cause this time corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
and?
bam! that walker colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. now if corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
you... you mean...  english bob killed him while...?
well he wasn't gonna wait for corky to grow no new hand. he walked over real close, bein' drunk, an' shot him through the liver.
i give it up 'cause i hate sleepin' out in the air... fuckin' sticks in my food... an' fuckin' bugs in my food... an' fuckin' rocks under my back...  shit, i sure do miss my fuckin' bed.
yeah... you said that last night.
last night i said i missed my fuckin' wife... tonight i just miss my fuckin' bed.
say, bill. that business in jackson county... did that really happen? i mean how they say it happened?
what business?
an' how there was two deputies up close pointin' rifles at you... had you dead to rights... an' how you pulled out a pistol an' blew them both away to hell... an' only took a scratch yourself.  uncle pete told me he never seen nothin' like it, shootin' your way out of a scrape like that.
well... i don't recollect.
you don't recollect!
say, ned... ?
yeah.
how many men you killed?  ain't you gonna answer?
i don't like the question.
well, i gotta know what kind of fellas i'm ridin' with, don't i? in case of a scrape.
how many you killed, kid?
five. i killed five of 'em.  that counts a mexican i killed.  he come at me with a knife.
get some sleep, kid.
you boys are crotchety as a couple of hens.
but if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
he will be hurryin' and he will miss. that there is as fast as i can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
but... if he doesn't miss?
then he will kill you. that is why there are so few dangerous men like old bob there... an' like me. it ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.  look here, let me show you somethin'.  see this here pistol?
them's the keys. all you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' english bob can ride out free as birds.
is... is it... loaded?
wouldn't be no good if it wasn't. you got to cock it though.
r-r-r-really? you r-r-really w- wwant...?
give it to him.
i brung this for when we had to kill them fellows.  i guess we could use some now.
not for me. i don't touch it no more.
god damn it, bill, it's rainin'.
i know it's rainin',  give the kid a drink, why dontcha?
no.
what he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' pete...
yeah?
i remember how there was three of them deputies you shot... not two.
well, i ain't like that no more, ned. i ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
you still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
mmmm pistols.
oh yeah.
rain's coming.
thank god.
"well, jim," i says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."
did you... kill him?
no,... but i can't abide them kind... an' you will find a lot of them in the saloons... tramps an' drunk teamsters an' crazy miners... sportin' pistols like they was bad men, but not having no sand nor character... not even bad character.
i do not like assassins an' men of low character like your friend english bob... but bob ain't no coward who will cry to your face an' then...
uh... sheriff... uh...
huh? oh.  another one, huh? shit, i guess i'm clean out of receptacles.
maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
what?
uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. i...
you... you remember eagle hendershot?
huh? uh... yeah.
i seen him.
he's dead, bill.
his head was all busted open so's you could see the inside.
jesus, bill, you got fever. take a drink, will you?
worms was comin' out.
listen, bill, i'm gonna see what's takin' the kid so long. must be he's gettin' an advance offa them sportin' ladies.
uh, no. no, i ain't drunk.
ordinance says you got to turn in your firearms to the county office day or night. i guess you didn't read it with the weather an' all.
well... uh... i... i ain't got no, uh, firearms.
them friends of yours in the back, they carryin' pistols?
i... dunno. i mean, i guess not. no, they ain't carryin' no guns.
you're spillin' your whiskey, mister.
like i said, i...
what's your name?
uh, william... uh... hendershot.
well, mister hendershot, if i was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if i was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, i guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?
i... i guess i might... but like i said, i ain't armed.
i guess you just carry it for snakes an' such.
uh... yeah. yeah.
there ain't no snakes in here, mister hendershot.
well, uh... it ain't loaded.
if they was just here for the fuckin', how come they lit out the back window?
on account of they seen you was beatin' on their friend.
you just kicked the shit out of a innocent man, you big asshole.
innocent of what?
jesus.  you done this before?
plenty of times.
his pistol must of jammed.
move the candle closer, i can't see.
he wouldn't of took no beating like that if it hadn't of jammed. he wouldn't just give it over an' not shoot no one.
he didn't even pull his pistol, huh?
he ain't as tough as you, kid.
well, i guess i woulda at least pulled my pistol an...
shit, kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.
that was your idea, i wanted to...
we're gonna need more food... at least three days worth...
three days? we could kill 'em tomorrow.
i don't kill nobody without him.
we don't need him. the two of us could do it.
depends what he told you.  about bill, you mean?
all of it. about him, an' you an' uncle pete... about robbin' the rock island pacific... an' about them missouri banks.
we done that stuff.
well i guess bill munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.
claudia... ain't here, bill.
ned... is that you, ned?  ned, i seen... death.
easy, bill.
i seen the angel of death ned, an' i seen the river.  he's a snake, he got... snake eyes.
who, bill? who got snake eyes?
the angel... the angel of death. i'm scared, ned. ned, i'm gonna die.
easy, bill, easy.
i seen her... i seen claudia too...
well, that's good now, ain't it, bill? seein' claudia an...?
she was all covered with worms. oh, ned, i'm scared of dyin'...
he's gonna die, ain't he?
maybe.
well, suppose he does?
we'll bury him.
that ain't what i mean.
you mean, am i gonna help you kill them cowboys?
i can't spot 'em myself but you could. that red-haired one, you could spot a half-mile off, i bet.
an' if i spot 'em?
i'll ride up close an' shoot 'em!
just like that?
i told you i'm a damn killer. i done it before.  i'm more killer than him.
yeah?
hell, yeah.
i thought... you was an angel.
you ain't dead.
some big guy beat the shit out of me.  i guess i must look a lot like you, huh?
you don't look nothin' like me, mister.
i didn't mean no offense.  i guess you're the one them cowboys cut up.  ned an' the kid, my partners, are they... ?
they went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
scouting?
on the bar t... looking for... them.
oh. how long i been here?
three days. are you hungry?
three days? i must be.
i thought i was gone. see them birds? most times i wouldn't even notice them birds much. but i'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause i thought i was dead.
i brought your hat. you... left it down at greely's.
that big guy lookin' for me?
are you really going to kill them?
yeah, i guess.  there's still a payment, ain't there?
them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment.
advances?
free ones?
alice an' silky gave them... free ones.
oh. yeah.
you want... a free one.
me? no. no, i guess not.
i didn't mean... with me. alice and silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
i... i guess not.  i didn't mean i didn't want one 'cause of you bein' cut up. i didn't mean that.
you're a beautiful woman an'... if i was to want a free one, i guess i'd want you more than them others. it ain't... see... i can't have no free one on account of my wife...
your wife?
yeah. see?
i admire that, you being true to your wife. i've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
yeah, i guess.
she back in kansas?
uh... yeah. yeah. she's uh... watchin' over the little ones.
finish him, ned.
he ain't dead? you didn't get him?
he got the boy's horse.
did you kill him?
he's clear of the horse, ned. better get him.
what happened? he ain't dead? what's goin' on?
if he gets behind them rocks we ain't gonna get him... not without we go down there.
what rocks? why don't you shoot? what's goin' on?
shit!
what happened, did you hit him?
how many left goddamit?
two.
better re-load it.
you missed him? you didn't...?
i got him.
he ain't killed.
maybe, maybe not. got him in the gut, i think.
they takin' water?
yeah.
when we gonna double back?
after a ways.
i'm goin' on down to kansas.
we got to kill this other one first.  shit, ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. then we could head back, all three of us, with the money.
you want the spencer, bill?
shit, ned, this ain't the time to quit.
you're gonna lose your share. if you don't...
shut up, kid.
me an' the kid, we'll head over to the ranch an' as soon as we find him, we'll shoot him. then we'll come back an' the three of us pick up the money an' head south together.
supposin' he don't go to the ranch?
i'll bet anything he won't go to town nor he won't ride out on the range. right off he'll hole up at the ranch.
i ain't waitin', bill.  i'll look in on your youngsters when i get back.
ned, don't pay no mind to what the kid said about the money. i'll bring your share along, hear? the kid's full of shit, hear?
i didn't think they'd really do it.
what did you think, they come clear up from kansas to fuck us?
that kid... he's just a... boy. and that other one, bill, being true to his wife...
what wife? he don't have no wife.
he said...
i told you, he don't have no wife, not aboveground, anyhow.
we got one of them fuckers, sheriff, out by cow creek, we...
alive?
hell, yeah. a bunch of us bar t boys went out lookin' on account of them killin' one of our own. we come across this fucker on a roan goin' south an'...
he admit it?
no... but i guess he will soon enough. had a spencer rifle on him an' he was...
those cowboys messin' him up?
uh... a little, maybe.
you an' andy get the hell out there. find out where them other two went.
he tell you where them others is?
nope.

didn't give us nothin' but his own name... ned roundtree.
well, ned, you'll want to tell me an' mister beauchamp here all about them two villainous friends of yours, i guess.  bring him in, boys, for i will be glad to know the names and the whereabouts of those other two murdering sonsofbitches.

yeah, he's in there.
well, he's holding on to his shit like it was money.
he's in there.

i can't see 'em.

yeah, i guess so.
shit... i thought they was gonna get us. i was even... scared a little... just for a minute.  was you ever scared in them days?
say, bill...
yeah.
that was... the first one.
first one what?
first one i ever killed.
yeah?
how i said i shot five men... it wasn't true.  that mexican... the one that come at me with a knife... i busted his leg with a shovel... i didn't shoot him or nothin'.
well, that fella today, you shot him alright.
h-hell yeah. i killed the hell out of him... three shots... he was takin' a sh-sh-shit an'... an'...
take a drink, kid.
oh ch-ch-christ... it don't... it don't seem... real... how he's... dead... how he ain't gonna breathe no more... n-n-never. or the other one neither... on account of... of just... pullin' a trigger.
it's a hell of a thing, ain't it, killin' a man. you take everythin' he's got... an' everythin' he's ever gonna have...
well, i gu-guess they had it... comin'.
we all got it comin', kid.
i was watchin' you... seein' if you was followed.
silky an' faith, they rode off to the east an' two deputies was followin' them.
i trust you, bill.
well, you don't wanna trust me too much. we'll take ned his share together so you don't figure i run off with it.
ned's share?
yeah, he went south ahead of us. i guess we'll catch him before...
he's... he's dead.
no he ain't. he went south yesterday.
they... they killed him. i... thought you know that. i thought you knew because...
nobody didn't kill ned, he went south yesterday. he didn't even kill nobody. why would anybody kill ned?
who killed him?
little bill. the... the bar t boys caught him and little bill...
he hanged him?  shot him down?
n-no. he... he beat him up. he was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... ned just died.  little bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
good example! good example of what i'd like to know? he didn't even kill nobody... he couldn't do it no more.
they got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
a sign on him?
in front of greely's. it says, "this here is what happens to..."
they got a sign on him in front of greely's?
the questions little bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
about where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
what'd ned say?
l-lies... at first. about how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' little bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on ned an' ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
then... what?
a cowboy come in sayin' you killed quick mike in the shit house at the bar t...
an' little bill killed ned for what i done?
not on purpose. but he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. first ned wouldn't say nothin'... but little bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
he said how you was really three fingered jack out of missouri... an' bill said "same three fingered jack that dynamited the rock island and pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" an' ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than william bonney or clay alisson or the james brothers an' how if he hurt ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a u.s. marshall in '73.
didn't scare little bill though, did it?
n-no, sir?
lemmee see that schofield, kid.
wha... what f-for?
lemmee see it.
sure. sure, bill.
you... gonna take... the money?
you better get on back, miss.
you could have it. all of it.
i thought you wanted to buy spectacles an' fancy clothes an' all.
i'd rather be blind and ragged than dead, i guess.
this here money, take my share an' ned's an' leave it with my youngsters. tell 'em half goes to sally two trees if i ain't back in a week. the rest is yours... you could buy them spectacles.
are you... are you gonna... kill little bill?
i guess you won't mind my keepin' the bottle.
you're gonna kill him, ain't you?
stay clear of folks you might see. there's plenty out lookin' to hang you. go on now, skedaddle.
he should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
i guess you are three-fingered jack out of missouri, killer of women and children.
i have done that... killed women and children... i have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now i have come to kill you, little bill, for what you done to ned.  now step aside. boys.
i... i... think i'm... shot.
you ain't shot.
p-p-p-please, i'm not armed.  m-m-my g-god. you killed... little bill.
you sure you ain't armed?
i never c-c-carry arms. i'm... a writer.
a writer? what do you write... letters an' such?
b-b-books.  you... you killed five men... singlehanded.
yeah.
wh-wh-who did you kill first?
huh?
wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
yeah?
i was lucky in the order.  i always been lucky killin' folks.
who was next? clyde? or was it...?
i could tell you who was last, mister.
i don't... deserve this... to die this way. i was... building a house.
"deserve" don't mean shit, little bill.
i'll see you... in hell, you three fingered asshole.
hullo, paw.
i guess you lost some hogs to the fever.
three.
three? that ain't bad considerin'.
that fella come by... tom.
tom?
the one you rode out after... the one that had the pistol...
the kid, yeah...
only he wasn't carryin' no pistol this time.
he say anythin'... the kid... ?
tom? only how... how if you didn't... didn't come back in a week...  how we was to take half the money to sally an' say you was...
well, i come back, didn't i?
did you... did you... ?
did i what?
all that money... i mean... did you...?
steal it? naw, i didn't steal it.
no... i meant...
what?
k-k-kill somebody?
who said that?
n-nobody... only you took your shotgun an' that pistol an'...
before i met your maw, god rest her soul, it used to be i was kinda... wicked... drinkin' spirits an' gettin' into scrapes an' all. only she made me see the error of my ways an'... i ain't like i was no more.
i guess you didn't kill nobody then.
naw, son, i didn't kill nobody.
