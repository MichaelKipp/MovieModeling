a meteor?
no sir. definitely not.
how do you know?
well, er... it's slowing down.
it's doing what?
it's... slowing down, sir.
what are you waiting? my social security will expire, you'll still be sitting there.
i'm thinking.
so think already.
you have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
you don't move soon. i'll begin to decompose.
david, i've been meaning to talk with you. it's nice you've been spending so much time with me, but...
dad, don't start.
i'm only saying, it's been what? four years, you still haven't signed your divorce papers.
three years.
three, four. move on. it's not healthy.
what the hell is the point of having a beeper if you don't turn it on?
it was turned on. i was ignoring you. what's the big emergency?
started this morning. every channel is making like it's nineteen fifty. snow, static, all kinds of distortions. no one knows what the hell is going on.
what the hell is this?
so sue me.
did you try to switch to transponder channels?
please, would i be this panicked if it was that simple?
let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.
we've tried. it's not working. it's almost as though they weren't even there.
stop it.
it's all fuzzy.
you're gonna break it. just leave it alone. here, take your medicine.
i don't need it.
just take it, dick head.  alicia! make sure he takes his medicine.
get on the horn with atlantic command. let's upgrade the situation to defcon 3.
that's not your call to make, mr. nimziki.
there's good news and bad news.
what's the bad news?
you're in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
and the good news is you won't charge me.
no. the good news is i found the problem and it's not our equipment. there's some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
that's the good news?
yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. when i find the exact binary sequence and i apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer i built you last christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
...and we'll be the only guys in town with a clear picture? that's my man.
just what the hell do you think you're doing?
i'm bringing home the bacon. earning my keep. and doing a fine job if i do say so myself.
it's the wrong field, you idiot! lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
you sure?
damn it, he was doing you a favor. you know how hard it is to find someone who doesn't think you're completely crazy? what are we supposed to do now? huh? where are we supposed to go now?
organize a military escort to crystal mountain.
sir, i strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
can we expect the same kid of panic here as in russia?
more than likely.
i'm not leaving.
we must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
i want the vice president, secretary of defense, the whole cabinet and the joint chiefs taken to a secured location. i'm staying here. i am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
but, mr. president...
so far these things have not become hostile. for the moment let's assume they won't.  connie, let's issue statements advising people not to panic, to stay home and take cover.
with your permission, mr. president, i'd like to remain my your side.
i had a feeling you would.
sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
then god help us.
i've got a lock on the signal pattern. we can filter it out.
huh? oh, good, good.
strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. the signal reduces itself every time it recycles. eventually it will disappear. are you listening?
can you believe this?
what're you talking about?
haven't you been watching?
he's trying to impress you.
he's doing a good job.
tell her to get the kids and leave town.
what happened?
just do it!
okay, why did i just send my family to atlanta?
remember i told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
not really...
that signal. it's a countdown.
a countdown to what?
think. it's like in chess. first you strategically position your pieces. then, when the timing's right. you strike.
then what?
checkmate.
what do you want?
you have to leave the white house.
this is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
you don't understand. you have to leave washington.
in case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
i've worked with embedded loading. they're communicating with a hidden signal. they're going to attack...
you're being paranoid.
it's not paranoia. the embedding is very subtle. it's probably been overlooked...
pops!
the television said they've started with the looting already. vultures.
you still got the olds?
you want to borrow the car? you don't have a license.
that's okay. you're driving.
you can't go. call them back.
baby, you know how it is. i have to report to el toro right away.
you said you were on leave for the fourth.
they cancelled it. why are you acting like this?
wait. i have to tell you something.
what?
be careful.
look, after your shift tonight, why don't you grab dylan and come stay with me on base.
really? you don't mind?
naw. i'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
you know, you're not as charming as you think you are.
yes, i am.
dick-weed!
butt-munch.
it's the white house, for crying out loud. you can't just drive up and ring the bell.
can't this thing go any faster?
you think they don't know what you know? believe me, they know. she works for the president. they know everything.
they don't know this.
and you're going to educate them? tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at m.i.t. to become a cable repairman?
dad...
all i'm saying is they've got people who handle these things, david. they want hbo, they'll call you.
more ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
this is crazy. we're loosing our first strike capabilities!
we're trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we're getting nowhere. atlantic command is working on a type of visual communication.
he's got that sega saturn cd, 64 bit, right?
yeah. what would you think if we went there to live for a while?
that'd be cool!
what the hell is that?
this, pops, is every phone book in america.
you think an important person like constance is going to be listed?
she always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. sometimes it's just her first initial, sometime her nickname...
not listed, huh?
i just haven't found it yet. i tried c. halbrook, connie halbrook, spunky halbrook...
spunky?
college nickname.
you try martin?
she didn't take my name when we were married.
i don't believe it. they make you learn how to fly everything from an apache to a harrier and still they turn you down? what else do they want you to learn?
how to kiss ass.
jasmine has this thing for dolphins. i had them make it...
i thought you said you were doing to break it off.
perfect, she's using it.
it's perfect the line is busy?
yes. i can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the white house.
you can do that?
what?
connie, don't hang up.
david? how'd you get this number?
walk to the window. right in front of you.
they let you out?
just what the hell do you think you're doing?
we're leaving, don't try and stop us.
you're not going anywhere. you hear me? i'm still your father.
troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
for once in your life think about what's best for troy. who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? who?
and when is the countdown supposed to expire?
fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
what do you want me to do?
i want you to leave with us. right now.
i can't leave. we have to tell this to the president.
he's not going to listen to me.
sure he'll listen. why wouldn't he?
because last time i saw him i punched him in the face.
you punched the president in the face?
he wasn't the president then.
david thought i was having an affair, which i wasn't.
punched the president? oh my god.
i don't know how you put up with him.
he used to run the nasa. he knows where all the bones are buried. comes in handy.
i'll bet.
moishe martinsburg, mr. president.
my ex-husband works in satellite communications.
general grey, co-ordinate with atlantic command. tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
but mr. president...
and get those helicopters away from the ship. call them back immediately.
what the hell's going on?
we're leaving.
is my wife in the air?
she should be shortly.
but i gave you some this morning.
i didn't take it. i thought i didn't need it anymore.
you saved a lot of lives.
i could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  you know, when i flew in the gulf war everything is simple. we knew what we had to do. it's not simple anymore, connie. a lot of people died today. how many didn't have to?
any news on my wife?
the helicopter never arrived at nellis and there's been no radio contact.
where are they?
eta with target; four minutes.
that is an affirmative. i have victory dance. mmmmmmm.
don't get premature on me, jimmy. we don't light up 'til the fat lady sings.
i hear you.
it's air force one for crying out loud. still he gets sick?
moishe, please, don't talk.
he still gets air sick, huh? in all of this i didn't get the chance to thank you two.
think nothing of it, spanky.
spunky. he told you about that?
all he could think about was getting to you. there's still love there i think.
love was never our problem.
all you need is love. john lennon. smart man. shot in the back, very sad.
i shouldn't have left her.
don't worry, big guy. i'm sure she got out of here before it happened.
damn it!
i didn't even see them fire!
command, eagle one. switching to "sidewinders." we're moving in.
we're losing them.
then get them out of there.
jimmy, kick it! they're gaining.
we're already over mach 2!
so push it!
stevie... i can't...
jimmy, stay with me.
i couldn't find anything. everyone is packing up, they're leaving. word is a space ship is heading this way.
we should leave too.
there's a group heading south, they said there's a hospital just a couple hours away. i think we should follow them.
penicillin. at least it will help keep his fever down.
it's really nice of you to help us.
i wish i could do more but we're moving out.
we're going with you. i mean, we're going too.
cool.
i spoke with the joint chief when they arrived at norad. they agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. hit 'em with everything we've got.
above american soil?
if we don't strike soon, there may not be much of an america left to defend.
that's impossible...
my god, the vice president and the joint chiefs...
mr. president, we must launch. a delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities!
you can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
david, don't...
dad, please...
what was it, roswell? you had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, area fifty one. that's it! area fifty one. you knew and you didn't do nothing!
why the hell wasn't i told about this place?
two words, mr. president. plausible deniability.
mr. president, a real pleasure. they don't let us out much, you know.
yes.
well, i guess you'd like to see the big tamale? follow me.
see, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. but since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. the last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
people are dying out there. i don't think "exciting" is the word i'd choose to describe it!
what can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
not all too dissimilar to us. breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they're interested in our planet.  hey, you wanna see them?
can they be killed?
these three died in the crash. their bodies are as frail as our own. you just have to get past their technology, which is, i'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
you were the head of the national intelligence agency! you knew all about this. when were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
it had been deemed classified.
christ, why didn't you say anything about this when they first arrived? you could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of american pilots!
atlanta, chicago and philadelphia, destroyed?
and there are scattered reports of sightings over miami, ft. worth, and memphis.
and our forces?
we're down to approximately fifteen percent, sir.  if you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
we're being exterminated.
your son.
he's my angel.
was his father stationed here?
he wasn't his father. i was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.
so, what do you do for a living?
i'm a dancer.
really? ballet?
no. exotic.
oh. sorry.
don't be. i'm not. it's good money.  'side, he's worth it.
and when the dancing's over? what about your future?
funny, it used to scare me when i thought about the future.  guess it doesn't really matter anymore.
dylan, come here. i want you to meet the first lady.
i thought you didn't recognize me.
didn't want to say anything. i voted for the other guy.
why did you people come here?
air... water... your "sun."
where do your people come from?  where is your home?
here... now.
and before here?
many worlds...
can we negotiate a truce? is there room for co-existance?  can there be peace between us?
peace? no peace.
what do you want us to do?
die.
just my luck, no ice.
i take it you've heard.
a toast to the end of the world.
you still believe in him.
he's a good man.
better be. you left me for him.
i wanted a career. didn't you ever want to be part of something special?
mr. president?
deploy.
call them back.
the other bombers might have more luck. we shouldn't just give up...
i said call them back.
you're late.
you know how i like to make a big entrance.
david, david! what the hell are you doing!?
i'm making a mess.
this i can see.
we've gotta burn the rain forest, pops. dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. maybe if we screw this planet up enough they won't want it anymore.
david, you're drunk.
pops, you're a genius!
what'd i say?
a cold? of course.
this is ridiculous.
how long would their shields be down?
with their shields down it might be possible.
please, you're not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? we don't have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
organize every plane you can find and get some goddamned pilots to fly them.
yes, sir.
how're we doing?
better than we thought.
we have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. most of europe, the middle east and asia are battle ready.
and our troops here?
we've been collecting planes from all over but...
but what, general?
pilots, sir. we don't have enough people to get them in the air.
then find them.
how' he doing?
just fell asleep. he's gonna be just fine. join me in a little celebration?
i'll see how they're doing with the radio transmitter.
oh shit, we're late.
we'll meet you there.
thirty seconds? isn't that cutting it a little too close?
we'll be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
with you? i don't understand why you can't just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?
if anything goes wrong i'll have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?
you're late.
you know me...
i know, you like to make a big entrance.
before we do this, i want you to know i'm sorry.
sorry for what?
i should have done this a long long time ago.
mr. president, just what do you think you're doing?
i'm a pilot, will. this is where i belong.
thanks, pops.
i want you should know, i'm very proud of you, son.
i have a confession to make. i'm not real big on flying.
great.
what the hell are you doing?
just getting a feel for her.
grey, you read me?
roger, eagle one, our primary target has shifted course.
where's it headed?
i think our secret is out. they're headed right for us.
do not engage until we've confirmed the package has been delivered.
roger.
must be thousands of them. what are they doing?
looks like they're preparing the invasion.
get us out of here!
i can't shake her free.
what're you doing?
it's not me. they're overriding the system.
this could be our last night on earth. i don't want to die a virgin.
if we do, we'll both die virgins. but at last we'll be together.
nice meeting you.
you as well.
we're loose!
doesn't matter. game's over.
i don't hear no fat lady.
you scared the hell out of me.
yeah, but what an entrance!
dick-weed.
butt-munch.
are you all right?
did it work?
you bet it did.
