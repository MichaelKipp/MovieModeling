a meteor?
no sir. definitely not.
how do you know?
well, er... it is slowing down.
it is doing what?
it's... slowing down, sir.
what are you waiting? my social security will expire, you will still be sitting there.
I am thinking.
so think already.
you have any idea how long it takes for those things to decompose?
you do not move soon. I will begin to decompose.
david, I have been meaning to talk with you. it is nice you have been spending so much time with me, but...
dad, do not start.
I am only saying, it is been what? four years, you still have not signed your divorce papers.
three years.
three, four. move on. it is not healthy.
what the hell is the point of having a beeper if you do not turn it on?
it was turned on. i was ignoring you. what is the big emergency?
started this morning. every channel is making like it is nineteen fifty. snow, static, all kinds of distortions. no one knows what the hell is going on.
what the hell is this?
so sue me.
did you try to switch to transponder channels?
please, would i be this panicked if it was that simple?
let's retrofit the dish to another satellite.
we have tried. it is not working. it is almost as though they were not even there.
stop it.
it is all fuzzy.
you are going to break it. just leave it alone. here, take your medicine.
i do not need it.
just take it, dick head.  alicia! make sure he takes his medicine.
get on the horn with atlantic command. let's upgrade the situation to defcon 3.
that is not your call to make, mr. nimziki.
there is good news and bad news.
what is the bad news?
you are in meal penalty for disturbing my lunch.
and the good news is you will not charge me.
no. the good news is i found the problem and it is not our equipment. there is some weird signal embedded within the satellite feed.
that is the good news?
yes, because the analog signal has a definite sequential digital patterns embedded within it. when i find the exact binary sequence and i apply a phase reversed signal to that calculated spectra analyzer i built you last christmas, we should be able to block out the overlay completely...
...and we will be the only guys in town with a clear picture? that is my man.
just what the hell do you think you are doing?
I am bringing home the bacon. earning my keep. and doing a fine job if i do say so myself.
it is the wrong field, you idiot! lucas' farm is on the other side of town.
you sure?
damn it, he was doing you a favor. you know how hard it is to find someone who does not think you are completely crazy? what are we supposed to do now? huh? where are we supposed to go now?
organize a military escort to crystal mountain.
sir, i strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
can we expect the same kid of panic here as in russia?
more than likely.
I am not leaving.
we must maintain a working government in a time of crisis...
i want the vice president, secretary of defense, the whole cabinet and the joint chiefs taken to a secured location. I am staying here. i am not going to add to a public hysteria that could cost lives.
but, mr. president...
so far these things have not become hostile. for the moment let's assume they won't.  connie, let's issue statements advising people not to panic, to stay home and take cover.
with your permission, mr. president, I would like to remain my your side.
i had a feeling you would.
sir, what happens if they do become hostile?
then god help us.
I have got a lock on the signal pattern. we can filter it out.
huh? oh, good, good.
strange thing is, if my calculations are right it will be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. the signal reduces itself every time it recycles. eventually it will disappear. are you listening?
can you believe this?
what are you talking about?
have not you been watching?
he is trying to impress you.
he is doing a good job.
tell her to get the kids and leave town.
what happened?
just do it!
okay, why did i just send my family to atlanta?
remember i told you that the signal hidden within our satellite signal is slowly recycling down to extinction.
not really...
that signal. it is a countdown.
a countdown to what?
think. it is like in chess. first you strategically position your pieces. then, when the timing's right. you strike.
then what?
checkmate.
what do you want?
you have to leave the white house.
this is not the time or the place to have this same old discussion.
you do not understand. you have to leave washington.
in case you have not noticed, we are in a little bit of a crisis here.
I have worked with embedded loading. they are communicating with a hidden signal. they are going to attack...
you are being paranoid.
it is not paranoia. the embedding is very subtle. it is probably been overlooked...
pops!
the television said they have started with the looting already. vultures.
you still got the olds?
you want to borrow the car? you do not have a license.
that is okay. you are driving.
you can not go. call them back.
baby, you know how it is. i have to report to el toro right away.
you said you were on leave for the fourth.
they cancelled it. why are you acting like this?
wait. i have to tell you something.
what?
be careful.
look, after your shift tonight, why do not you grab dylan and come stay with me on base.
really? you do not mind?
naw. I will just tell my other girlfriends they can not come over tonight.
you know, you are not as charming as you think you are.
yes, i am.
dick-weed!
butt-munch.
it is the white house, for crying out loud. you can not just drive up and ring the bell.
can not this thing go any faster?
you think they do not know what you know? believe me, they know. she works for the president. they know everything.
they do not know this.
and you are going to educate them? tell me something, you are so smart how come you spent eight years at m.i.t. to become a cable repairman?
dad...
all I am saying is they have got people who handle these things, david. they want hbo, they will call you.
more ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
this is crazy. we are loosing our first strike capabilities!
we are trying to communicate with them on all frequencies but we are getting nowhere. atlantic command is working on a type of visual communication.
he is got that sega saturn cd, 64 bit, right?
yeah. what would you think if we went there to live for a while?
that would be cool!
what the hell is that?
this, pops, is every phone book in america.
you think an important person like constance is going to be listed?
she always keeps her portable phone listed, for emergencies. sometimes it is just her first initial, sometime her nickname...
not listed, huh?
i just have not found it yet. i tried c. halbrook, connie halbrook, spunky halbrook...
spunky?
college nickname.
you try martin?
she did not take my name when we were married.
i do not believe it. they make you learn how to fly everything from an apache to a harrier and still they turn you down? what else do they want you to learn?
how to kiss ass.
jasmine has this thing for dolphins. i had them make it...
i thought you said you were doing to break it off.
perfect, she is using it.
it is perfect the line is busy?
yes. i can use he signal to triangulate her exact position in the white house.
you can do that?
what?
connie, do not hang up.
david? how did you get this number?
walk to the window. right in front of you.
they let you out?
just what the hell do you think you are doing?
we are leaving, do not try and stop us.
you are not going anywhere. you hear me? I am still your father.
troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
for once in your life think about what is best for troy. who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? who?
and when is the countdown supposed to expire?
fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
what do you want me to do?
i want you to leave with us. right now.
i can not leave. we have to tell this to the president.
he is not going to listen to me.
sure he will listen. why would not he?
because last time i saw him i punched him in the face.
you punched the president in the face?
he was not the president then.
david thought i was having an affair, which i wasn't.
punched the president? oh my god.
i do not know how you put up with him.
he used to run the nasa. he knows where all the bones are buried. comes in handy.
I will bet.
moishe martinsburg, mr. president.
my ex-husband works in satellite communications.
general grey, co-ordinate with atlantic command. tell them they have twenty five minutes to get as many people out of the cities as they can.
but mr. president...
and get those helicopters away from the ship. call them back immediately.
what the hell's going on?
we are leaving.
is my wife in the air?
she should be shortly.
but i gave you some this morning.
i did not take it. i thought i did not need it anymore.
you saved a lot of lives.
i could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  you know, when i flew in the gulf war everything is simple. we knew what we had to do. it is not simple anymore, connie. a lot of people died today. how many did not have to?
any news on my wife?
the helicopter never arrived at nellis and there is been no radio contact.
where are they?
eta with target; four minutes.
that is an affirmative. i have victory dance. mmmmmmm.
do not get premature on me, jimmy. we do not light up 'til the fat lady sings.
i hear you.
it is air force one for crying out loud. still he gets sick?
moishe, please, do not talk.
he still gets air sick, huh? in all of this i did not get the chance to thank you two.
think nothing of it, spanky.
spunky. he told you about that?
all he could think about was getting to you. there is still love there i think.
love was never our problem.
all you need is love. john lennon. smart man. shot in the back, very sad.
i should not have left her.
do not worry, big guy. I am sure she got out of here before it happened.
damn it!
i did not even see them fire!
command, eagle one. switching to "sidewinders." we are moving in.
we are losing them.
then get them out of there.
jimmy, kick it! they are gaining.
we are already over mach 2!
so push it!
stevie... i can't...
jimmy, stay with me.
i could not find anything. everyone is packing up, they are leaving. word is a space ship is heading this way.
we should leave too.
there is a group heading south, they said there is a hospital just a couple hours away. i think we should follow them.
penicillin. at least it will help keep his fever down.
it is really nice of you to help us.
i wish i could do more but we are moving out.
we are going with you. i mean, we are going too.
cool.
i spoke with the joint chief when they arrived at norad. they agree, we must launch a counter offensive with a full nuclear strike. hit 'em with everything we have got.
above american soil?
if we do not strike soon, there may not be much of an america left to defend.
that is impossible...
my god, the vice president and the joint chiefs...
mr. president, we must launch. a delay now would be more costly than when you waited to evacuate the cities!
you can not be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
david, don't...
dad, please...
what was it, roswell? you had the space ship, the bodies, everything locked up in a bunker, the what is it, area fifty one. that is it! area fifty one. you knew and you did not do nothing!
why the hell was not i told about this place?
two words, mr. president. plausible deniability.
mr. president, a real pleasure. they do not let us out much, you know.
yes.
well, i guess you would like to see the big tamale? follow me.
see, we can not duplicate their type of power so we have never been able to experiment. but since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. the last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
people are dying out there. i do not think "exciting" is the word I would choose to describe it!
what can you tell us about the enemy we are facing?
not all too dissimilar to us. breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold... probably why they are interested in our planet.  hey, you wanna see them?
can they be killed?
these three died in the crash. their bodies are as frail as our own. you just have to get past their technology, which is, I am sorry to say, far more advanced.
you were the head of the national intelligence agency! you knew all about this. when were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
it had been deemed classified.
christ, why did not you say anything about this when they first arrived? you could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of american pilots!
atlanta, chicago and philadelphia, destroyed?
and there are scattered reports of sightings over miami, ft. worth, and memphis.
and our forces?
we are down to approximately fifteen percent, sir.  if you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we are looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
we are being exterminated.
your son.
he is my angel.
was his father stationed here?
he was not his father. i was kinda hoping he would want the job, though.
so, what do you do for a living?
I am a dancer.
really? ballet?
no. exotic.
oh. sorry.
do not be. I am not. it is good money.  'side, he is worth it.
and when the dancing's over? what about your future?
funny, it used to scare me when i thought about the future.  guess it does not really matter anymore.
dylan, come here. i want you to meet the first lady.
i thought you did not recognize me.
did not want to say anything. i voted for the other guy.
why did you people come here?
air... water... your "sun."
where do your people come from?  where is your home?
here... now.
and before here?
many worlds...
can we negotiate a truce? is there room for co-existance?  can there be peace between us?
peace? no peace.
what do you want us to do?
die.
just my luck, no ice.
i take it you have heard.
a toast to the end of the world.
you still believe in him.
he is a good man.
better be. you left me for him.
i wanted a career. did not you ever want to be part of something special?
mr. president?
deploy.
call them back.
the other bombers might have more luck. we should not just give up...
i said call them back.
you are late.
you know how i like to make a big entrance.
david, david! what the hell are you doing!?
I am making a mess.
this i can see.
we have got to burn the rain forest, pops. dump toxic waste, pollute the air, rip up the ozone. maybe if we screw this planet up enough they will not want it anymore.
david, you are drunk.
pops, you are a genius!
what did i say?
a cold? of course.
this is ridiculous.
how long would their shields be down?
with their shields down it might be possible.
please, you are not buying into any of this nonsense, are you? we do not have the manpower or the resources to launch that kind of a campaign.  not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan is dependent on a machine that no one in the world is qualified to operate.
organize every plane you can find and get some goddamned pilots to fly them.
yes, sir.
how're we doing?
better than we thought.
we have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. most of europe, the middle east and asia are battle ready.
and our troops here?
we have been collecting planes from all over but...
but what, general?
pilots, sir. we do not have enough people to get them in the air.
then find them.
how' he doing?
just fell asleep. he is going to be just fine. join me in a little celebration?
I will see how they are doing with the radio transmitter.
oh shit, we are late.
we will meet you there.
thirty seconds? is not that cutting it a little too close?
we will be well on our way out of there before we shoot that thing off.
with you? i do not understand why you can not just show someone how to plant the virus, somebody trained for this kind of mission?
if anything goes wrong I will have to think quickly, adjust the signal, who knows?
you are late.
you know me...
i know, you like to make a big entrance.
before we do this, i want you to know I am sorry.
sorry for what?
i should have done this a long long time ago.
mr. president, just what do you think you are doing?
I am a pilot, will. this is where i belong.
thanks, pops.
i want you should know, I am very proud of you, son.
i have a confession to make. I am not real big on flying.
great.
what the hell are you doing?
just getting a feel for her.
grey, you read me?
roger, eagle one, our primary target has shifted course.
where is it headed?
i think our secret is out. they are headed right for us.
do not engage until we have confirmed the package has been delivered.
roger.
must be thousands of them. what are they doing?
looks like they are preparing the invasion.
get us out of here!
i can not shake her free.
what are you doing?
it is not me. they are overriding the system.
this could be our last night on earth. i do not want to die a virgin.
if we do, we will both die virgins. but at last we will be together.
nice meeting you.
you as well.
we are loose!
does not matter. game's over.
i do not hear no fat lady.
you scared the hell out of me.
yeah, but what an entrance!
dick-weed.
butt-munch.
are you all right?
did it work?
you bet it did.
