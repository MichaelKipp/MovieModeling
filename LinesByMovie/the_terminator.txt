yes, chuck?
come to the office, please.
mission control to chuck, come in...
you are late.
are not i worth waiting for?
not really.  do you think you can get here on time if i put you on the floor as a waitress?
i do not know.  i kinda had my heart set on being a cashier the rest of my life.
the pay's the same but you will make more in tips.
thanks, chuck.  i need the money.  can i still work the hours around my classes?
mmm.  same schedule's okay.
alright!
can you handle it?
it is not brain surgery, chuck.
here you go.  you are a bob's girl now.  nancy will check you out.
i will not let the fat kid down.
anything else?
a phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
just what you see, pal.
the uzi 9 millimeter.
you know your weapons, buddy.
any one of them's ideal for home defense. which'll it be?
all.
you can not to that...
wrong.
i have not seen you in here lately, mr. miller.
what is it to ya?
you must have a girlfriend.
that is none of your business.
aha!  is she young?
compared to me she is.  how come you are not at the cash anymore?  they catch ya steal- ing?
what is it to ya?
i had him hooked.  he was just about to ask me out. i could tell.
that guy's a jerk.  i did you a favor.
I will do the same for you sometime.
what do you think?
great.
great.
you are a big help.
alright, the beige one.
i hate the beige one.
do not wear the beige one.
give me the short version.
six shots at less than ten feet.  weapon was a large caliber--
okay, let's see...got a pos- itive on her.  she is sarah connor, works as a legal--
that can not be right.  that is the name of the one valley division mopped up this after- noon.
here's her driver's license.
you got to be kidding me.  the new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  a one-day pattern killer.
i hate the weird ones.
not lately.  did you check messages?
i thought you did.
that bum.  so what if he has a porsche, he can not treat you like that...it's friday night for crissakes.

I am going to a movie, kiddo. see ya'.  you and matt have a good time.
we will, kiddo.
that stuff's two hours cold.
i know.
i put a cigarette out in it.
did you reach the next girl yet?
no.  keep getting an answer- ing machine.
send a unit.
i already did.  no answer at the door and the apartment manager's out.  I am keeping them there.
call her.
i just called.
call her again.
same shit.
i can hear it now, it is going to be the goddamned 'phone book killer'.
i hate the press cases. especially the weird press cases.  where you going?
to make a statement. I am going to give them the name.  maybe the jackals can help us out for once.
if they can get this on the tube by eleven, she may just call us.  how do i look?
like shit, boss.
...look, lieutenant...uh, vukovich, do not put me on hold and do not transfer me to another department...
i won't.  now just relax. where are you?  yeah, i know it...on pico. are you alright?
yes, but i do not want to leave.  i think this guy's following me.
alright, ms. connor.  listen carefully.  you are in a public place, you will be safe 'til we get there.  stay visible. do not go outside or in the restroom.  I will be there in a few minutes.
go!  go!  he is got her.
suspect westbound on olympic.  grey sedan.  has hostage, repeat...
do you understand?
yes.  do not hurt me.
I am here to help you.  reese, sergeant/tech-com, dn38416...
this is a mistake.  i have not done anything.
no. but you will.  it is very important that you live.
but outside, it is living human tissue.  flesh, skin, hair...blood.  grown for the cyborgs.
look, reese, i know you want to help, but...
pay attention.  the 600 series had rubber skin. we spotted them easy.  but these are new.  they look human.  sweat, bad breath, everything.  very hard to spot.  i had to wait 'til he moved on you before i could zero him.
hey, I am not stupid, y'know. they can not build anything like that yet.
no.  not yet.  not for about forty years.
so, it is from the future, is that right?
one possible future.  four your point of view.  i do not know the tech stuff.
and you are from the future too?
right.
just let me go.
listen.  understand.  that terminator is out there.  it can not be reasoned with, it can not be bargained with...it does not feel pity of remorse or fear... and it absolutely will not stop. ever.  until you are dead.
there is so much...
tell me.  just start at the beginning.
--everythingis gone.  just gone.  there were survivors. here.  there.  nobody knew who started it.  it was the machines.
i do not understand...
defense network computer. new. powerful.  hooked into everything. trusted to run it all.  they say it got smart...a new order of intelli- gence.  then it saw all people as a threat, not just the ones on the other side.  decided out fate in a microsecond...extermination.
did not see the war.  i was born after, in the ruins.  grew up there.  starving.  hiding from the h-k's.
the what?
hunter killers.  patrol machines. build in automated factories. most of us were rounded up, put in camps...for orderly disposal.
here, drink some of this...
lieutenant, are you sure it is them?  maybe i should see the ...bodies.
they have already been identi- fied.  there is no doubt.
sarah.  sarah, this is dr. silber- man.  I would like you to tell him everything reese said to you.  do you feel up to it?
i guess so.  you are a doctor?
so.  you are a soldier. fighting for whom?
with the one thirty second under perry, from '21 to '27--
the year 2027?
and who was the enemy?
skynet.  a computer defense system built for sac-norad by cyber dynamics.  a modified series 4800.
i see.  and this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  a sort of retroactive abortion?
yes.
that silberman just crack me up.  he had this guy in here last week who set his afghan on fire. screwed it first, then set it on--
shut up.
...it had no choice. the defensive grid was smashed. we would taken the mainframes... we would won.  taking out connor then would make no difference.  skynet had to wipe out his entire exist- ence.  we captured the lab complex.  found the...what- ever it was called...the time-displacement equipment. the terminator had already gone through.  they sent two of us to intercept, then zeroed the whole place. sumner did not make it.
then how are you supposed to get back?
can't.  nobody goes home. nobody else comes through. it is just him and me.
you go naked.  something about the field generated by a living organism.  nothing dead will go.
why?
i did not build the fucking thing.
okay.  okay.  but this...  cyborg...if it is metal...
surrounded by living tissue.
of course.
why were the other two women killed?
most official records were lost in the war.  the computer knew almost nothing about connor's mother.  her name. where she lived, just the city. no scanner pictures.  the terminator was just being systematic.
you have heard enough.  decide. are you going to release me?
I am afraid that is not up to me.
then why am i talking to you? get out.
i can help you...
who is in authority here?
why do not you just stretch out here and get some sleep.  it will take your mom a good hour to get here from redlands.
i can not sleep.
go ahead.  you are safe.  there are thirty cops in this building.
okay.
you cold?
freezing.
come here.
reese...you got a first name?
kyle.
kyle, what is it like when you go through time?
white light.  pain.  like being ripped inside out... slowly.  like being born, maybe.
i caught one, back there.
caught one?  you mean you got shot?
we gotta get you to a doctor.
it is okay.  forget it.
forget it?  are you crazy? let me see it.
this is gonna make me puke. talk about something.
what?
just talk.  tell me about my son.  is he tall?
what is he like?
you trust him.  he is got that strength.  you would die in a second for john.
well, at least i know what to name him.  i do not suppose you would know who the father is? so i do not tell him to get lost when i meet him.
john never said much about him.  he dies.  even before the war...
stop!  i do not want to know. hold still.  so...it was john that ordered you here?
i volunteered.
you volunteered?
it was an honor.  a chance to meet the legend.  sarah connor.  who taught her son to fight...organize, prepare. from when he was a kid.  when you were in hiding, before the war.
I am sure.
come on, me? the mother of the future?  am i tough? organized?  i can not even balance my checkbook.  i cry when i see a cat that is been run over... and i do not even like cats.
ow!  no, it is okay.  it is better tight.
and anyway, what do i know about guerrilla warfare?
you will learn.
look, reese, i did not ask for this honor and i do not want it. any of it.
john gave me a message for you.  made me memorize it. 'sarah"...this is the message... 'sarah, thank you.  for your courage through the dark years. i can not help you with what you must soon face, except to tell you that the future is not set... there is no such thing as fate, but what we make for ourselves by our own will.  you must be stronger than you imagine you can be.  you must survive, or i will never exist.'  that is all.
good field-dressing.
you like it?  it is my first.
sleep.  it will be light soon.
okay.  talk some more.
about what?
about where you are from.
bag some z's?
let's get cleaned up, kyle.
thanks a lot.
what is that?
that is where we are going.
why?
look.  i found it.  is not that it?  cyber dynamics corporation?
what about it?
did not you say that they are going to develop this revolutionary new thing...
molecular-memory.
whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build el computer grande...skynet...for the government.  right?
that is the way it was told to me.
well, we are going to uninvent the bastard.  eighty-six it.  we will blow up the place...burn it down.  something.
tactically dangerous.  we lay low.
reese.  think it through. we can prevent the war. nobody else is gonna do it. if we go to anybody official we wind up back in jail and then that walking cuisinart has got us again.  we have to so it ourselves.
that is not my mission.
listen.  understand.  I am not a military objective, reese.  I am a person... you do not own me.
let's go.  time to move out.
fuck you!  let go of me!
kyle?
I am wrong here.  i was not meant to see this...
is this enough?
yes.  and i do not want to know where you got it.
I am dying for a shower.  you could use one too.  and we would better check that bandage.
later.  I am going out for materiel.  keep this.
what is that?
nitroglycerin, basically. bit more stable.  i learned howto make it when i was a kid.
make sure there is none on the threads, like this.  now screw the end-cap on...very gently.
you must have had a fun child-
that is good.  now, seven more like that while i make fuses.
i was thinking, there is so much I have got to show you when we get through this. it is mind boggling, the pos- sibilities...disneyland, the beach, movies...matinees with popcorn and foot-long hot dogs...
hot dogs?
i want to buy you a hot dog so bad,kyle...all the things you have never seen and done.  you are here, but wherever you go, and whatever you touch, you bring the war with you.
my whole life has been combat.
i want it to be over for you.
not possible.
i want it to be over for me too. i feel like i slipped over some invisible line, that I am in your world now.  everything's the same, but i see it differently. it is like, there is you and me, and him...but nobody else can understand or help or even touch us.
he will find us, will not he?
probably.  sarah, if i get zeroed...
do not say that.
if i do, you have to get away, disappear without a trace. different country, different name, everything.  in case they send another one.
it will never be over, will it? look at me, I am shaking. some legend, huh?  you must be pretty disappointed.
no.  I am not.
kyle, the women in your time...what were they like?
good fighters.
that is not what i meant. was there someone special?
someone?
a girl.  you know.
no.  never.
so much pain.
pain can be controlled. you disconnect it.
and so you feel nothing.
it is better that way.
oh, kyle.
I am sorry.  i should not have said...
kyle...
i bet you are ticklish.
ticklish?
what are you doing?
you will beg for mercy in a second.
i do not think i like this.
you are not supposed to.
sarah.
we did it, kyle.  we got it.
what are you doing?
cover...our footsteps...
