you harlin?
nope.  darrell.
harlin around?
he's up at the look out.
will he be back soon?
doubt it.  he's dead.  the look out's a cemetery.
you own this place?
yep.
then why do you call it harlin's?
'cause harlin used to own it.
but he's dead.
so?
you want to take a look at my car?  i think the radiator hose is--
damn.  gonna be another hot one today. sometimes i don't even want to get out of bed. course don't want to get out for the cold one's neither.  then of course the clouds come in...
look, harlin, i've got places to be.
darrell--
ok. darrell... could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  it's busted.
so?
it's your radiator hose.  it's busted.
i know it's busted.  what did i just tell you?
well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
if i could do you think i'd be standing here wasting my time.  can you fix it, or do i have to go somewhere else?
somewhere else?  mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
okay, i'm stuck.  you happy?  now can you fix it, or not?
yeah, i can fix it.
great!
gotta run over to the yard and see if i can find a hose like this one, or close enough. gonna take time.
how much time?
time.
twenty-after-ten.
jesus.  twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
ninety-two.  course half hour from now might be seventy-two. these clouds move around a lot.
accident.
you got to be more careful. hands is important.  let me show you something. when i was a kid, now i don't know if you can still see it, but i gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
i'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
diner up a piece.  not much, but us simple folk like it.
i'll be back in a couple of hours.  and be careful with her, will you?
hey!  you there!
you want something, old man?
don't call me old man.  ain't you got no respect, boy?
you want something?
yeah i want something.  i want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
you can't do that yourself?
hell no, i can't do that myself.  i'm blind.  can't you see that?
i'm sorry, i didn't--
what'd you think i was doing out here with these glasses on?  sunnin' myself?
i don't know.  i thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
i ain't got no eyes.  you want to see?
christ no!
lost my eyes in vyee-et-nam.  lost them fighting the commies.  fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me.
i said i was sorry.
don't be sorry.  just run over there and get me my pop before i die of thirst.
yeah, sure.  you got change?
change?  you want my change?  i fought the war and lost my eyes just so i could give you my change?
all right, old man.  christ.
don't forget to open it for me.  i can't be opening my own bottle.
christ!
i think you'd better give your pooch a sip. he looks sick.
that's 'cause he's dead.
oh, jesus.
i hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
what the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
he's only just dead.  what was i supposed to do with him?  i can't take him away anywhere.  and nobody wants to take him for me.  do you?
hell no!
see.  ain't nothing i can do but keep him here beside me.  that's where he belongs anyways.  me and jesse, that's my dog, not anymore, but me and jesse we been pals since the war when i lost my eyes.  he was just a pup then... a companion that's loyal, that'll keep coming back to you no matter how much you kick him...i miss him.  i'll see ya later, unless i come across something worse.
can i give you a hand, beautiful?
i'm just going to my car?
that's right on my way.
my mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
my name is bobby.  now i'm not a stranger anymore.  see how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
do you have to call me that?
i don't know your real name.
maybe i don't want you to.
maybe, but if you didn't i think you would have kept on walking.
you're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
i like that about me, beautiful.
it's grace.
may i carry your package, grace?
jesus.
you sure you can manage?
i got it.
do you want me to carry your pack for you?
no, i've got it.
what happened to your hand?
accident.
you should be more careful.
it's very nice of you to help me.  that package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
no trouble at all, really.
wasn't nothing.
oh, this isn't my car.  it's down a ways. i should have parked closer.  i just didn't think it would be so heavy.  i could drive up.
that's all right.  i got it.
thank you, bobby.
you're welcome, grace.
you're not from around here, are you?
why you say that?  just because i help a lady with her package?
you don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
i just drove in this morning.
drove into superior?  what for?
didn't have a choice.  my car overheated up the road.
you're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  day like today, you'd be dead in no time. when you leaving?
not until my car's fixed.  i don't know how long that's going to take.
and here i've made you all hot and sweaty.
morning grace.
morning sheriff. got my drapes.
well it's about time. looks like you found yourself a helper too.
well, he offered, and i just couldn't refuse. his car overheated.
oh?
morning, officer.
son.  little excitement out at the reservation this morning. wayne and dale elkhart were up drinking all night and then wayne starts chasing dale around the desert with his shotgun. bia handled it. i went by for backup.
anybody hurt?
hell, no. that wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. he's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self.  well, anyhow, you stay cool. nice meeting you, son.
where you coming from?
all over.  chicago, houston, detroit.  just lately dallas.
you've been around.
i guess i've got wander in my blood.
where you headed?
i don't know.  i have to make a stop in vegas.  business to finish.  then maybe i'll head to santa barbara.  i might be able to pick up some action there.
so, what is it you do, mister...?
cooper. bobby cooper. oh you know, whatever pays best. little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
i never played tennis. you just travel around bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  you must like taking chances.
if you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
what happens when you lose?
i pack up and go somewhere else.
that's good.  cools you right off.  i saw you watching me.
i'm sorry.  i didn't mean to.
i didn't say it bothered me.
did you like it; me watching you?
i guess.  i've got an ego same as any man.
good, 'cause i liked what i saw.
nice place.
thank you.
must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
i guess it must.
what do you do anyway?
a little of this, a little of that.  mostly i tell fortunes.
where'd you learn to do that?
from my father.  he was the tribe's shaman.
a medicine man?
those are white words, not ours.
nice house for a shaman's daughter.  you must be good.
come here.
my face tell you all that?
it tells me what every face tells me. everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  what is it you want?
the same thing you do.
there.  all done.  lift me down.
what?
lift me down.
you can let go of me now. i'm safe. how do they look?
like you.
beautiful?
i like them.  i was sick of looking at this room.  i think they add a little life.
nothing like a little liveliness.
no more drapes to hang.  now what should we do?
i have an idea.
and what would that be?
you flirt with me, then you run cold.  you lead me on, then slap me down.  i don't go for being jerked around.
really?  and what game did you want to play?  you carry my box for me, and i fall into bed with you?
i think i can find my own way back to into town.
maybe i like to find out about a man first. maybe i like to know what he's made of.
i'm just flesh and blood, baby.  that and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  but you already know that.  you read my mind, remember? thanks for the lemonade.
you never did answer my question.
still playing?
that's not an answer.  what is it you want?
you know what i want.
maybe i just want to hear you say it.
who the hell is this!?
who the hell are you?
i'm her husband.
now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or god help me i'll break you in half.
easy, chief. i... i was helping your wife. i met her in town.  she needed a hand with her drapes.  that's all.
didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
i swear to you that's all that happened.  i haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
a lot that means.
grace, tell him.
you can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! i'm gonna tear you a new asshole!
you broke my nose!
it ain't broke.
what the fuck do you want?
i'll give you a lift, son. too hot to be walking... people die out here, y'know.
after you huffed off, grace lied so bad, i got so pissed off, i pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. sorry i lost my cool like that. it's a funny thing, women.
yeah...
say, what happened to your hand?
accident.
you've got to be--
yeah, i know.  more careful.
i guess we've never been introduced proper. jake mckenna.
that's a solid name.
i'm a solid man.
bobby cooper.
"bobby cooper." what brings you to superior, coop?
an overheated car.
oh? darrell taking good care of you?
darrell's a moron.
california...
live there?
got work.  i know a man who's got a boat. wants me to sail it for him.
you a sailor man?  that'd be the life. drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  a man could pretty well disappear like that.  just sail away until all he was was a memory.  i guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
i hope so.  listen, mckenna about your wife:  if i had known she was married--
it wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  not a wit.  do you know why? because you're a man without scruples.
wait a second--
ah, i can smell it on you.
hey!
that's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  don't be offended, lad.  a man who's got no ethics is a free man.  i envy that.  beside, how can i blame you?  that grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  eh?
she does at that.  i knew when i married her she was a free spirit.  a woman with her looks and a man my age; what was i to expect?  but you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. so, i married her.  what are you to do, eh? women.
can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
"you can't shoot 'em!" i like that.  i bet she led you on good, didn't she?  taking you up to the house to hang drapes. oh that's a good one. bet she had you hard as a rock wiggling her ass in your face.  i bet you just wanted to pull down her pants and hog her out. then me busting in like some wild bear. ha! bet you had a fire going under you.
like you don't know.
mad like a dog in heat, i bet you were.  i can tell you got a temper on you.
would you?
would i what?
would you kill her?
i've done a few things but i'm not a murderer, mr. mckenna.
how do you know if you've never tried?
this is a joke, right?  you just want to rattle me.  right?
got any cold soda?
eh?
soda.  you got any soda?
hablar slowly, por favor.  my ingles no es bien.
soda.  you know.
i call the sheriff.
no! no police.
hey.
hey, your ... what the hell happened to you?
nothing.
don't look like nothing.
just banged my head.  it was an accident.
another accident?  you got to be more careful.
what the hell happened to my car?
bottom hose was shot too.  rotted clear through. had to put a new one in. runs like a dream now.
well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
how much!?
hundred-fifty.
to replace a goddamn radiator hose!?
a goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half mustang.  you know how long it took me to find that hose?
about an hour and a half, because that's all the longer i've been gone.
actually, it's been about three hours. you're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  what you expect but fancy damn prices?
that's a ford, not a ferrari.  you going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a ford?
"that's not just a ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half mustang."
what's that got to do with the radiator hose?
i don't know, but "it's the reason i'm living here and you're just passing through."  now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
it might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because i don't have the money.
then you ain't gonna have the car.
listen, man.  i got rolled half an hour ago for everything i had.
then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  you can keep that dollar. now why don't you just take your american express gold card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on tv and have him send you the money lickity split.
i don't have a goddamn credit card.
now that's too bad.  i sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off.
...got no day, got no date.  probably ain't worth a duck's fart . this one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. no sir i'll stick with this .
you son of a bitch! i'll have my lawyers shut you down.
you ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. sweet talk me all you want.  didn't you read the sign? it says...
what sign? fuck the sign. i want my car.
i want my hundred and forty-five dollars.
you got a beer?
what kind?
beck's.
no beck's. a-1, coors...
heineken?
no, we ain't got no heineken.  we got miller.
genuine draft?
no.  just plain ol' miller. now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it.
i'll fuckin' take it. to go.
hey, mister.  you gotta quarter for the juke?
what?
i wanna play a song on the juke.  you got a quarter?
what happened to your hand?
i cut it shaving; i know, i gotta be more careful.
got any requests?
that country shit all sounds the same to me.
how about i pick one out for you?
you like patsy cline?  i just love her. how come, i wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
cause she's dead.
gee, that's sad.  don't that make you sad?
i've had time to get over it.
you're not from around here, are you? where you from?
oz.
you ain't from oz.  oz is in that movie.
you're too quick for me.
i axed you a question.
aw, toby, we weren't doing nothing.  we was just talking.
you shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  now, i'm not going to axe you again, mister.  what were you doing with my girl?
i wasn't doing anything.
that's not the way it looked to me.  looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
make time?  is everybody in this town on drugs?
honest, toby.  i just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
stay out of this, jenny.  we got man's business to take care of. i ain't never taken no drugs, mister, and ...
then maybe you should've. look, pal, i wasn't making a play for your girl.
you expect me to believe that?
i don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
mister, i'm calling you out.
what?  you want to fight?  over her?
let's see...they're not very imaginative?
'cause i'm just like dynamite.  and when i go off, somebody gets hurt.
fine.  i was making time with your girl. now i'm scared to death and i learned my lesson. now can you go away?
not before i settle with you, chickenshit!
christ, i don't believe this!
stand up.
i wasn't hitting on your girl!
stand up, mister, or i'll beat you where you sit.
my lord, that little baby of yours virgil, has gotten cuter'n a bunny's nose.
what was that all about?
you know how that toby is.  thinks every man he sees is after his jenny.
more like jenny is after every man she sees.
let me get your change.
flo, i'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee.
son of a bitch!
virgil!  now look at what you done!  are you all right?
i think i burned my gun hand!
shasta!  now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  sorry about that, mister.  let's see, you want $3.25.  you try to have a nice day now, would you?
sure, i'll try.
that's a shame, bobby.  a real shame.
and that's not the half of it, mr. arkadin...
"arkady"
right, mr. arkady. and that's not the half of it. i got your money, and i go into this little grocery store in this hicktown to get something to eat and then... well, it gets <u>robbed</u>!
...and let me guess.  this robber -- he gets your money.
no. two of them. two robbers. and they <u>both</u> get nailed... get shot by the old lady.
the old lady?
with a <u>shotgun</u>!  she kills <u>both</u> of 'em, and... and the money in my bag gets all shredded to bloody pieces. not one bill is left alive.  i mean, what are the odds?
mr. arkady, honest, i ad to beat it outta there before the cops showed. so now i don't have a cent to my name. i can't even get my car out of the garage.  i tell you, mister...  if it weren't for bad luck i wouldn't have nay fuckin' luck at all, you know?   so, i was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so i could get my car out of this garage, see?  the bus depot here has a western union thing.  and of course i'll pay it back with the rest of the money.
which you don't have.
but which i can get. no problem. look, i can sell my car in vegas. blue book it's worth 16 at least. i just need the 150, uh...
yeah, if you could send it care of...
...now, let me get this straight. two years you give me problems with your fuckin' payoffs. now you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
a hundred-forty-five would probably cover it.
a hundred and ... now you listen to me you deadbeat little punk:  i don't care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and <u>i want it</u>.  i don't care how you get it, or where from, but i want it on my desk tomorrow, or i'll show you what real bad luck is.
what'd you say to me!
shit i'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain i'm under. i'm just under a lot of strain here.
what can i do for you, lad?
i was hoping we could talk.
talk?  about what?
about things.  about your wife.
sweet grace?  what about her?
about what you said this morning.
you said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  fifty-thousand dollars.
i do.
you said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
i did?
don't play simple with me, jake. you're a betting man. you want me to spell it out for you? i'll kill grace if you cut me in on the money.
boy i think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
i'm not rambling.
you're talking like a madman.
well then, i guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. you're the one brought it up. this morning. in your car.
oh, that was just loose talk. husband gettin' pissed off.  i don't want anybody dead.
bullshit.  you wanted me to kill her.
a man doesn't always mean the things he says.
you meant it.
what makes you say that?
because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
and what does that make you?
the slimy bastard who's going to do it for you...  you're a jealous man jake. if you can't have grace to yourself...well, you're not the sharing kind.
well, i guess i have what you call a love-hate relationship with grace.
you love her, but you hate her?
no, i hate loving her. i hate the kind of person she is. i hate having to tolerate the little "games" she plays. like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. the bitch. she loved to play. she wants me to hit her and when i hit her she likes it. she tortures me. but she's family. she's my little girl. my baby. i couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. no. not me. but you? you got the killing in you, boy...how much you want?
how much could you get?
maybe ... ten-thousand.  and that's a maybe.
i need thirteen.
that's a bit much.
we're not talking about buying a car jake. we're talking about killing your wife. it's thirteen, or it's nothing.
you drive a hard bargain, but i had a feeling you were my boy when i met you.
i'm not your boy.  i don't like you.  i got no choice but to do business with you. let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience.
don't say that.  i had a marriage of convenience with grace, and look where that's lead...  well, looks like we got ourselves a contract.
if you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? the thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. if it doesn't, then it's no good.  i won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere.
how do you want it?
how the hell should i know?  i've never had a wife killed before. jesus christ! <u>you</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? i guess i should have hired a professional.
you want to do this yourself?  i don't have to do this, you know.
be quiet, boy.  i got to figure this thing. i'm thinking. it can't be done at the house. it should be...
come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront?
oh yeah sure. why don't i buy you a plane ticket right out of here while i'm at it. i <u>know you</u>...  this is what you do:  go to the house to see her.
and tell her what?
...i don't know.  tell her you had to see her.  tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. sweet talk the woman.  a young buck like you must be good at that.  then ... maybe shift the conversation.  get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  she loves that thing.  maybe the only thing she does love. she'll want to take you for a ride.
i know you're not surprised i'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all.
yeah, well i said i was an idiot. whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk...
how do you know he's still not here?
guys like me take those chances. let's go.
are there snakes out here?
they hear you comin'.  they won't bother you. just don't sneak up on 'em.
doesn't the isolation bother you?
yeah, but i like the sun.  i grew up on a reservation.  the sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  jake's the same way.  he loves the desert.  i guess we're alike that way.  that's about the only way.
you love him?
no.
did you ever?
depends on what you call love. i grew up on a reservation. a patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. that's where they stick indians, bobby. that's where they leave us to die. my brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. there's no hope there... jake was my ticket out. mom and me.
is that why you're with him?
i let him think he was courtin' me, but i reeled him in like a fish on a line. i wanted him. i wanted what he could give me, and i would've done anything to get him. is that love?
i'm guessing no.
yeah, i guess you're right.
i take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
i'm still here, aren't i?  see this?
all this nothing? it doesn't get to jake like it gets to me.  he says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  more like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
you could leave him.
i don't know how.
walk away.
it's not that easy.  maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  i can't. i don't want to be alone.  i need to know i'm going to be taken care of.
you need a meal ticket is what you mean. some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
is that so bad?  it's not like i wouldn't try to make him happy.  for awhile, anyway. i mean, i would ... do things for him.  i guess i'm no good that way.  i guess i tried to sucker you along like that.  do you hate me for it?  i wouldn't blame you if you did.  but maybe it's like you said: you just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
what's the matter?...grace?
nothing.
don't feel like nothing.
get out of town, bobby, as quick as you can.
grace, i've been fucked over too many times, by too many women.  you're becoming the queen of hot and cold.
you'd never understand.
try me.
it's just such a mess. with jake i mean...
nothing i understand better than a mess.
you mean the shaman?
he <u>was</u> a shaman...in the mine. we had nothin' after he died. jake took us in, gave us a little money. he used to call me his "little halfbreed"... he kept mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. he had kids in phoenix i think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see...  ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. he loved to do things to me. believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
yeah.
you're sick too...he loved to do things to me. control me. my mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. she become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- i liked it. i liked being controlled by jake. the truth was as far out and crazy as he got, i wanted <u>more</u>. i wanted to go all the way. women say they don't want to be taken like, <u>really taken</u> -- that's bullshit -- they do. the first time he finished with me, he said i was a woman now. i was 14. then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. it's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... they found my mom right down there  at the bottom of apache leap. she had cactus needles stuck all over her body and virgil...sheriff potter said she was drunk and went insane. but i'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. she was born on this earth and she loved it. she was like me. she just wanted to fly away.
after he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when i saw her body, i swore to her on my soul that some day i'd get jake for what he did to her...
i'm sorry...
yeah. what do you want. life, right?  have you ever been to california?
yeah.
oh yeah. it's far, it's another world.
is it pretty?
oh yeah. it's beautiful, beautiful beaches. blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
please. i won't hang on you. as soon as we get there you can dump me. i don't care. i just want to get out of here.
honey, baby, i <u>can't</u>. i can't even get out of here <u>myself</u>. believe it or not, i need a lousy hundred and fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic...
darrell?  you know he and jake are...
you don't have any money put away, do you?
jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
...you could get me money. i'll get you out of here.
where?
jake hides it. in a safe. in the floor. in the bedroom. he counts it. he loves to sit there and count it.
what do you mean?
at night. he just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. i heard him. my mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. maybe more.
in <u>cash</u>?
oh yeah. there's nothing else with jake. he don't trust banks. he keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. he loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. i never seen it but i know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
one-hundred-thousand!?  that son-of-a-bitch.
it takes a key.  he keeps it on himself all the time.  i mean <u>all the time</u>.  it scratches up against me when we do it.
if the key's on him, how do we get the key?
kill him.
i can't kill, grace. i can't kill anybody.
it's not like he's a young man, bobby. he's had time to live. it'd be quick. i mean, he wouldn't even have to <u>feel</u> it...  i mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
next time you'll do just fine.
no!
you sure seen a lot for a blind man.
just 'cause i ain't got eyes doesn't mean i can't see.
that a fact?
maybe i do.
or maybe you just think you do. just another small town. one guy chasing you. you go big town. just gonna have four guys after you instead. kiss kissy kiss. it gets down to one thing -- are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.
i think i've heard that before.
what do you want for free?
you sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
seems like i do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. and everything is everything.
what?
...and everything is nothing too.
cocksucker motherfucker! cops. i hear you. always sneaking around. thinks i can't see him. well he's right. motherfucker. but that ain't mean i don't know what's going on around here. they're all cursed. yes sir.
who's cursed?
all them miners last century. hungry ghosts, killed off all the indians. up at the mine. earth ran red with blood, think i'm fooling around here. white sky was on fire. grown men cried like babies. i saw a flash, then darkness descended upon me. they put me in the joint. took my eyes. i cursed them. white people can't seem to stay away from indians . you gotta watch where ya put your fingers. pussy pussy pussy, indian pussy.
i thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
so now you're going to tell me where i lost my eyes. you don't think i know where i lost my eyes? i was there when i lost them. i lost them in the war. the war in the joint. there's always wars in the joint. cause i was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. be careful, boy.
musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. this town's all inbreeding.
well, people gotta get by somehow. that's the curse. the mines done it. all that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! everybody's got a mother. you don't rip up your mother. you don't rip up the earth and take everything out. it's like the cracker jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...
i got things to do.
...but ain't you got a little something for the infirm?
i'm a little short pops. i'll catch you next time.
your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.
hey mister. mister, i just... i just wanted to thank you.
for what?
for defending my honor this afternoon.
i hate to bust your bubble honey, but i wasn't defending you.
but you was going to fight for me.
i wasn't going to fight for you.  i was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
he's not my boyfriend.  i mean, i let him take me out and stuff, but i ain't spoken for.  not yet that is.
get it through your head, little girl; i'm not going for you.  if this toby likes you, then if i were you i'd marry him.  you're not going to get much better in this town.
that's what i thought until you came riding in.  i saw your car over at the gas station.  it's a cool car.  want to take me for a ride?  desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
how old are you?
eighteen... well, i'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
no, i don't want to take you for a ride. what i want is for ... hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?
mister!
oh, shit!
that's right, mister.  you better be afraid.  i told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  now i find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
i wasn't sneaking around with your girl. would you please tell him?
you're too late, toby.  we're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
what the hell are you talking about?
what's your name anyway?
oh, that tears it, mister.  i'm gonna bust you up but good.  i'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  that's what i'm gonna do.  you don't know what you're dealing with, mister.  i'm crazy.  i'm psycho crazy.
yeah, i know.  you're tnt.  just like dynamite.  when you go off somebody gets hurt.  all right.  let's do this.
toby tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and i'm gonna have his love child.
will you shut up!
i want to stay.
i said come on!
where ya goin'?
harlin's.
get in.
seen you popping up a little bit of everywhere today.  you're not planning on staying are you?
no, sir. i'm not going to be around long if that's what you're worried about.
that's a nasty cut you got there.
yeah, fell down and hit a rock. not as bad as it looks.
there was a young fellow over at jamilla's today when it got hit.  way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.
sounds like it. i wish i could help sheriff, but i just want to get my car and get on up the road.
hey there.  i was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  you don't look so good.
yeah, well, i've been around the bend a bit.
one of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you ain't no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
you've been there?
hell, i've had days i would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
you believe that?
you think bad, and bad is what you get.
that's a good piece of advice, darrell.
no charge.
listen, darrell, about that hundred-fifty bucks for the car, as soon as i get where i'm going i swear i'll--
two-hundred.
what?
it's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
you said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
yep.  for the hose.  but while you was gone i replaced a gasket.  that's going to run you another fifty.
i didn't tell you to replace any gasket.
yeah, but it was shot.
i don't give a fuck! i didn't tell you to do it!  you can't just do unauthorized work.
well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  didn't you read the sign.
what sign?
the goddamn sign on the wall. i can't do unauthorized work?  what am i suppose to do? just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  then you get in an accident and get killed.  or worse.  who they gonna blame then?  they gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
what reputation?  you're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
is that an insult?  are you insulting me.
listen you stupid fuck, i want my car.
listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. you owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until i get it.  and if you take another five hours i'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. is that clear? now get out of here 'fore i call the sheriff, <u>who knows me</u>.
no! okay! okay!
what's the matter?  the fight gone out of you?  i'm just gonna smash a headlight. maybe two.
look, harlin.
darrell.
darrell. i'll get you your money. i just have to get something out of the trunk.
what the fuck did you do to my trunk?
well, that key's not gonna work. i had to pop the lock. you didn't leave me the trunk key.
and you had to go into the trunk, didn't you?
when i work on a car, i work on a car.
i need a ticket.
where to?
out of here.
but, in particular?
i ... mexico.  you got a bus that goes to mexico?  that's where i have to go.
mexico is a large country. where in mexico would you like--
i don't care, just get me there.
how about ciudad juarez? you could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in albuquerque. it'll get you across the border.
how much?
one way, or round trip?
one way.
30.55. twenty more will get you back.
twenty-seven, fifty.  that's all i got.
the ticket is 30.55.
keep your change.  bus three-twenty-three. leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.
i'm sorry.  it's just ... you know ...
where's the fire sweetheart? don't know how they work things in nevada, but we got speed limits in this state.
vat? i am going 5 miles an hour! i am looking town. i not even moving.
whoa, what kind of accent you got there? you one of them russians?
i am russian, da! i am also <u>rich</u> russian, da? maybe we work something out, my friend sheriff?
what? you trying to bribe me, mister? just cause you russians ain't commies anymore, don't think money can buy everything...
what's that?  ..."concealed" is a definite no no in this town, ivan. you know anything about jamilla's grocery store?
what fuckin grocery store, you fucking shithead idiot! you call yourself a police...
get out of the car, spread them. you can jawbone all you want or you have the right to <u>shut the fuck up</u>! you commie motherfucker. either way you're goin' to the can.
i want my lawyer!
i'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  i'm stompin' your ass.
you idiot!  you don't even know what you're fighting over!
my honor, that's what i'm fighting over. now get up off the ground, or do i have to whoop you where you lie?
toby!  toby tucker, leave him alone!
you stay away, jenny.  i aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see.
don't be afraid of him none.  i don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
get away from me!
now, what's this?
give it to me!
mexico?  you going to mexico?
i'm leaving.  you never have to see me again.  just please, give me the ticket!
this means something to you?  jenny means something to me.
i wanted to talk.
i don't think we have anything to talk about.
what about us?
there is no us, remember?
except i can't get you out of my head, grace.
stop it.
why?  am i making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
because i know you're full of shit.
i mean it, grace.  i'm getting out of here, and i want to take you with me.
i thought you couldn't get your car.
i could if i had jake's money.
is that what changed your mind?  the money?
i don't give a damn about the money.  i want you, and i want to get us out of this shithole.  there's only one way to do that.
are you sure?...  about me, i mean?
i came back for you; this morning i came back.  before i even knew about the money. you're what i want.  the only reason i stormed off is because you spooked me talking about jake.  but i've had nothing but time to think about it.  it keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here.  but we've got to get the money, baby.  we get the money, i get the car, then we get the hell out.
you said you couldn't kill anybody.
we don't have to kill him.  just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.  it was your idea, remember?  i'm doing this for you.  i'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
grace ... grace?
after dark.  i'll leave the back door unlocked.
who was that on the phone?
wrong number.
you spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  but then you make friends so easily.  don't you, grace?
i put up new drapes, jake.
i know.  i was here when your apprentice was helping you.  remember?
you never said anything.  about the drapes.
they look nice.
you haven't even looked at them once.
they look nice.
i picked them out for you, jake.  i thought you would like the colors.
what the hell you looking at, girl?
nothing, jake.  absolutely nothing.
ain't over yet.  night is part of day; separate, but equal.  night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
difference between you and me, old man, is i see the glass half full, you see it half empty.
night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. it's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.
you afraid of the dark?
afraid of it?  boy, i live in the dark. all cause of a woman who made me this way. people are afraid of what they can't see. i can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . it's all the same to me.
so, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  is that it?
more or less.
not this twig, friend.  i got plans.
nothing makes the great spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. we all got plans. i planned on seeing all my life. i know you didn't plan on straying into town.
no and i don't plan on sticking around either.
well, don't say i didn't warn you when things go your way.
you got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. one minute you lost your eyes in vietnam, next it's the joint. now it's a woman? i'm hep to you.
time's up. any last words of wisdom?
things ain't always the way they seem. you got to ask yourself: is it worth it? day comes earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
you <u>are</u> crazy, you know. be seeing you, old man.
you know i won't be seeing you.
ya little bitch, you like it don't you! you like it this way -- rough and hard. gotta go fuck around on me, like your mama, but you always gotta come home to daddy, don't you, cause you know daddy's the best.
yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
you been a bad girl, grace. you took my heart from your mama, didn't ya? you betrayed her! like you did me. there ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
oh no! oh please forgive me, papa!
you broke her heart! you broke your mama's heart. you stole me! that's right. fuck it away. but it ain't ever goin' away, cause your mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone.
no! no! please!
what's the matter?
you didn't hear something?
yeah, i heard a key slapping against my ass.
there's someone in the house.
jake, don't go out there. call the sheriff.
shhhh! just like your mama, always scared of things...
that's my gun... that fucking darrell!
i like darrell.  he may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. we own harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
i guess this is what they call "ironee"? hunh?
it's not what you think, jake.
no, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and i'm telling sheriff potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. and darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
wait a minute.  just listen to me...
...and he thought he'd clock old jake mckenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000...
i came for grace.
you came to take my wife from me?
shhh! liar.
it's the truth, jake.
that's a thick change of heart from this afternoon.
maybe i don't like being played, like she played us today.  maybe i don't like that at all, jake. i'm just pissed enough, maybe i'll rip the neck off my own grandmother.
you have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
damn it, jake. there is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or grace, then i pick grace.  you were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  give me two-hundred.  i'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. she showed me the perfect place. there won't be enough left for an autopsy.  but i need the the money.  i've got to have the money.
how the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
what are you talking about!
come on, jake --
don't jake me boy! it's a big house. you probably didn't even make it out to the desert this afternoon...
you'd tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
you know what kind of woman grace is, jake. you know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of superior.  what's she to you, jake; a woman who wants you dead?  let me kill her.  all i want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
two-hundred dollars?
two-hundred dollars...i'll do it!  i'll kill her!
help me, grace, help...
like you helped her, jake?
the money's right here! get the key!
no! you get it!
what you want?
open up!
we're closed.  come back when the sun comes up.
what the hell ... oh, it's you.  might've figgered. listen i got a waitress coming over.  what do you want?
i want my car.
you got the money?
two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  and this morning you was broke.
that's none of your business.  get the keys.
i don't want no dirty money.  i run an honest business.
yeah, like al capone on tax day. get the keys?
all i got's a hundred, darrell. you got change?
no.
figgers. there's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? deduct it.
bobby?  what the hell's the matter with you?
i ... nothing.  i just stubbed my toe on a rock.  hurt like hell.
i got the money all packed.  i put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. people'll think maybe me and jake went away.  buy us some time...i know a back road we can take.
good thinking.  what's all this?
i'm not coming back.
i can't see it.
it should be just up ahead.  hold on ... there!  there it is!
hey!  take it easy.  want to get us killed?
you don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
i don't know about that?
you spent a day in superior. i wasted my entire life there. i feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
we've still got some dead weight to get rid of.
can't we just dump him fast someplace?
i want a place where only the vultures will find him... it'll be over soon, grace.
then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
i'm not sailing his boat.
but i thought --
we're going to buy a boat of our own baby, and sail it wherever we want to go.
anywhere?
what the hell? why not? where should we go?
hawaii. i've read all about it. i've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. oh, god. i'd kill to go there.
you already have.
you know i thought you'd left me back there.
what are you talking about?
you fuck this guy -- get him to do your dirty work and you think you can take the money and dump me?
no baby, you got it wrong.
this road don't go to globe, grace -- where were you going to meet me?
i don't want the fuckin' money! i'm not gonna give up everything i got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. it's <u>you</u>. you <u>grace</u> or nothing. the whole thing... i want you to be my wife.... what do you way grace?
you sound just like jake... i did see into the future, virgil, but you weren't in it. go back to your family. they love you.
goddamnit virgil, stop!  don't!
...but i bet the story she <u>didn't</u> tell you was the best story of all. how old crazy jake <u>was really her papa</u>. and she <u>liked</u> fucking papa! and now she's killed the sonufabitch! just like she's gonna kill you!
get real bobby. he was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
he was in love with you grace. he would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
the only deal he had in mind was killing you for jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
he was a <u>cop</u>, grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop...
he was a scumbag!... he wanted <u>me</u>, bobby. these guys don't let go! even when they're <u>dead</u>...  you don't know what it was like, bobby. those two, they were the same.
so, aren't you going to ask me?
ask you what? you mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next?
don't you want to know...? i bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
let it go, baby. it's the past. i got a past...
don't you really want to know? was jake my daddy? was i fucking my own daddy? don't you want to know that?
why?
<u>i don't know why</u>!
no grace, my hand's bothering me.
you think now that jake's dead, there's all that money there and i don't need you anymore, and i might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!
don't you think i would've done it if i wanted to? what can i do to make you relax, baby?
you could give me my gun back.
i think nothing happens. you're dead meat. that's it.
you don't believe in anything do you, bobby?
i believe in this moment, that's all. there is nothing else.  come on. he must weigh 300 pounds.
well, nothing. we dump jake, we split the money, then you're on your own.
don't leave me. i want to say with you, bobby.
why? so when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again?
i was just baiting him! bobby, i had to tell him that to get his guard down. just like you told jake you was going to kill me!
you lied to me all along! lies, all lies. your mother, your father, what story are you on now?  how come the town didn't know you was his daughter?
when you're finished with me, i'm next! i been there, baby. i been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. i'll take you as far as california. if we can make that. after that you're on your own. try mexico. with all this bread, you can live like a queen.
i don't want to go to mexico, bobby! please, i really want to be with you. don't blow this. don't you think i care about you?
i think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. but it's nice to know you cared...
time to go for a walk, jake.
my mother died in this canyon.
save the mom routine, will ya grace. it doesn't work with me. one, two, three...
hope is a four-letter word.
but we all need that too. hold him.
thank you. thank you. i...i knew you wouldn't leave me, grace.
bobby? are you all right?
i busted my leg!
can you make it back up?
grace -- in the trunk of my car is a tow rope. it should reach down here. go get it, throw it down.
why's that?
'cause i love you.
and i love you too.
and love's a funny thing.  sometimes i don't know if i want to love you...
<u>jake</u>...
he <u>can't</u> help you now, honey!
