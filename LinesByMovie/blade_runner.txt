i kinda get nervous when i take tests.
do not move.
sorry.
already had i.q. test this year -- but i do not think i never had a...
reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  answer quickly as you can.
you are in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
what one?
what?
what desert?
does not make any difference what desert -- it is completely hypothetical.
but how come I would be there?
maybe you are fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  so you look down and see a tortoise.  it is crawling towards you...
a tortoise.  what is that?
know what a turtle is?
of course.
same thing.
i never seen a turtle.
but i understand what you mean.
you reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, leon.
whatcha mean, I am not helping?
i mean you are not helping! why is that, leon?
where the hell you been?
you know where i been.  i been on vacation.
next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
what is up?
holden got hit.
bad?
severed spine.  you would better get in here.  bryant's waiting for you.
I will see you in a minute.
six, huh?
five.  three nights ago one of them managed to break into the tyrell corporation.  killed two guards and got as far as the genetic sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
what was he after?
there was not much left of him, so we can not be sure.  but bio- chemical data and morphology records of the nexus-6 were reported missing.  going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send holden in to run voight-kampff tests on the new employees.  guess he found himself one.
you got a machine on it yet?
we are using esper -- a 231 -- that picked up holden's alarm.  its guess is that all five are in the city.
where do we start?
the tyrell corporation has a demo model.  check it out on the voight-kampff.  there is a chance the nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  if that is the case, everybody's up shit creek.
what was the cover on the one that got holden?
industrial refuse.
garbage man?
it is got to be right for my customer.
your customer, eh?
well, when do you get paid?
soon as i finish the job.
when might that be?
day after tomorrow.
oh!  day after tomorrow.
how come you were in my truck?
i was tired and did not have any place to go.
what is your name?
pris.
mine's j.f. sebastian.
hi.
you want to go home?
i do not have one.
oh.
where are your folks?
they left.
what about friends?
i have some, but i have to find out where they are staying.
we scared each other pretty good did not we?
we sure did.
I am hungry, j.f.
I have got stuff.  if you wanna go to my place?
i was hoping you would say that.
machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  i do not mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it is their personalities that usually get me.  somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  if that is true, whoever made esper should have been shot.
this is esper and I am ready.  go ahead please.
you equipped for random questions?
why, yes, of course.
you start.
the five in question are third generation nexus sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  are you with me?
how do i stop one?
unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
okay, but...
I am coming to that.  vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  a direct hit is a positive retirement.
whatcha doin'?
you scared me.
you look... better.
just better.
beautiful.
thanks.
and you live in this building all by yourself?
yeah, i live here pretty much alone right now...
twenty.
what is your problem?
methuselah syndrome.
what is that?
my glands.  they grow old too fast.
is that why you are still here?
yes.  i could not pass the test.
ah, you get hold of your friends?
as a matter of fact i did.  they have got some work to do tonight, but they are going to come tomorrow.
good.
here's something you might find interesting.  they have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. however, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
i know all that.
what about a summary then.
i think we are through for the night.
yes?
do you have something against science?
not if it works.
and what in your estimation works?
the umbrella.
it seems your department does not believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
a humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  if it is a benefit, it is not our problem.
but because your department can not do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it is a problem.  correct, mr. deckard?
it is artificial?
of course not.
are you apprehensive?
why should i be?
for the responsibility of your power.  being a police bureaucrat, you have got more than your share.
thanks.
black?
please.
is this to be an empathy test?
yes.
capillary dilation of the so-called blush response?  plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris?
may i ask a personal question?
go ahead.
have you ever retired a human by mistake?
no.
but in your profession that is a risk.
nothing is infallible, but so far the voight-kampff scale bas been foolproof.
like you said, mr. deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  the voight-kampff scale is a machine, is not it?
one that relies on human interpretation.  where is the subject?
sitting next to you.
i would not accept it.  also, I would report the person who gave it to me to the police.
you have a little boy.  he shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
I would take him to the doctor.
you are watching t.v. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
I would kill it.
in a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
is this testing whether I am an android or a lesbian?
you show the picture to your husband. he likes it and hangs it on the wall. the girl is lying on a bearskin rug.
you become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.
I would never get an abortion.
why not?
that would be murder, mr. deckard.
in your opinion.
it would be my child.
sounds like you speaks from experience.
last question.  you are watching an old movie.  it shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
ugh.
well?
if she is, the machine works.
the machine works.  she is.
how many questions did it take?
thirteen.
she did not know?
memory implant.  she was programmed. but i think she has transcended her conditioning.  i think she was beginning to suspect.
how many questions does it usually take, mr. deckard?
five, maybe six.
and how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
discreetly.
all pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an esper 231 -- i believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced.
let's keep our eyes on the road, deckard.
sorry.
we are going to have to start the sequence again if you do not stay with me, deckard.  concentrate.
how do you know I am not?
you are not responding to the stimulus.  i can see right here, I am not getting a reading.
I am tired of this.
almost through.
nerves of steel.
no rust?
i did not say that.  your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
meaning?
meaning you do not run as fast as you used to.
during the road test...
yeah?
your mind kept wandering.  that bothered me.
huh huh.
considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
true.
but you have not put in for emigration.
nope.
you are going to be over the limit.
listen, i could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but i still rather be here than up there.
what if you change your mind?
they will change the limit before i change my mind.
you sure?
never been more sure of anything in my life.
why did not you go?
too old.
but if you could?
my job is here.
me too.
what is going on down there?
he is not ready yet.
when?
tomorrow, he says.
is there anything else?
i know you think it complicates your work, but I am here to help.
I have already got more help than i need.
i think you need more help than you have got.
there is two reasons a man rejects help.  either because he is so good at what he does he does not think he needs it, or he is so insecure he can not admit it.
sounds like I am an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
two of us might be more effective than one.
i work alone.
you use your equipment, do not you?
so?
so, I am a piece of equipment. use me.
do i make you nervous?
yeah.
I am sorry.
i can imagine.
can you?  i couldn't.
they probably want to find out when they were made.
right.
yeah.
bryant here.  regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, esper's concluded that the only irregular category that tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  you better get on it.
i was just about to have my dinner.
if you hurry you will get back before it gets cold.  i got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  good luck.
four years.  which would make her termination date...
never mind.  do they have that knowledge?
longevity is classified.  no.
okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
nexus designated mary:  incept november 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
next.
nexus designated pris:  incept data december 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
number three.
nexus designated zhora:  incept june 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field.
taffey lewis?
yes?
can i come in?
I would like  you to take a look at these pictures.
of course.
you see i lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... what am i supposed to be looking for?
do you recognize any of them?
this one looks familiar, but i do not know.  naw.  there is one came in today looks a little like this one but...
what did she want?
who?
the girl that does not look like that girl.
nothing.  she wanted to know about suck night.
what night?
i did not know if i wanted to handle her -- i already got a snake act.  but my partner goes down there to the opera house on suck night to book the good ones.
what is suck night?
that is what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. bit i do not think that is her.
you talking about the opera house on the main?
book the good ones for where?
lots of places.  the tours, the clubs, the silicone shows, private parties.
what shows?
silicone valley.  lots of these science guys never leave that place.  we book two shows a month in there. those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
yeah?
I am with the american federation of variety artists...
there is been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
i do not know nothing about it.
you have not felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way?
how do you mean 'exploited'?
like to get this position.  did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
are you for real?
oh, yeah. you would be surprised what goes on around here.  I would like to check the dressing room if i could.
what the fuck for?
for holes.
it that mother real?
of course he is not real.  you think I would be working here if i could afford a real snake?
it is a good job.
you mean the snake.
the best.
does it eat?
come on.
jeezus!
sorry.
hey!  do your job but do not wreck mine, huh?
you would be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
i bet i would.
little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.
me.
and who do i go to about you?
she was gonna get away.
then let her get away.  i thought you were a pro -- you are supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
i did not like her.
you did not like her!?
look, go home.  get some rest. take an aspirin.
yeah.
i think i have no money.
it is okay.  forget it.
but i would like to buy you drink.
I will but you one.  what will you have?
vodka!
shot of vodka, please.
thank you very much.
my pleasure.
prosit.
prosit.
you want to see my friends?
sorry, do not have the time.
no problem.
those cockroaches?
ya.
how long you had these guys?
two months.  but this one is not guy.  it is girl.  his girl.
prosit.
prosit.
you like to kiss her goodbye.
no thanks.
i like you.
i like you too.
one more, eh?
i gotta piss.
how old am i?
i do not know.
my birthday is april 10, 2015. how long do i live?
four years.
do not just stand there looking at me.  it is not polite.
what do you want me to do?
sit.
you ever take a bath with a man before?
there is a lot i have not done with a man before.
this is my uncle roy, sebastian.
hello, glad to meet you.
can not thank you enough, mr. sebastian. if you had not come along...
we were worried to death.  it is awfully kind of you.
we are not used to the big city. where we come from it is not so easy to get lost.
you certainly have a nice place here.
well stocked.
sebastian does not like to go out too much.
i keep a lot of provisions right here.
i like a man who stays put.  an admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. you live here all by yourself, do you?
well, no, not really.  there is mr. deetchum, he is the watchman, he lives on the first floor.
how about breakfast, i was just going to make some.
if it would not be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
oh, no bother, I would be glad to.
well, actually
then we are stupid and we will die.
not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  how are things at home?
he knows what he is doing.
if he will not cooperate?
mr. sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated.  we will appreciate him and he will cooperate.
I am great.  i mean, i know I am not really great, but i feel just great.  how you like my new suit?
well, you do not have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
do not make me laugh.  it makes me pee.
sorry.
hey, it is okay.  i like to pee. so how are you doing?
I am doing okay.
from what i hear you are doing great.  bryant tells me you are going like a god damn one-man army.  making a lot of money, huh?
yeah.  but that is what i wanted to talk to you about.
money?
no.  i got a problem.
let's hear it.
i think I am starting to empathize with these nexus-sixes.
what is that?
I am taking a piss.
love is just another name for sex. love is sexy and sex is lovely -- i do not care what you call it, an android can not have it.
these are not just...
i know what they are, deck -- look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way.
i told you I would come back.
you did?
you did not hear me.  you were sleeping.
who is this?
me and my dad.
where is he?
dead.
oh.
how come you are not on the job?
i am.  part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
how are you doing?
not too good.
what do people do in the afternoon?
if they are smart, they take naps.
do you dream?
yeah.  sometimes.
i wish i could.
did you cry when your father died?
yeah.
that is another thing i can not do.
nobody is freer than when he dreams.  i read that.
it was not very good last night, was it?
i do not know, i have nothing to compare it to.  i guess i thought there was something more to it.
what?
i do not know... i think i missed something.
like?
I am not sure.  is there a secret?
why are you staring at us?
you are just all so... so different.
what, sebastian?
you are androids.
what makes you think so?
you are all so perfect.
what generation are you?
nexus - 6.
show me something?
like what?
like...
i think, therefore i am.
very good, pris.  now show him why.
we have a lot in common.
you mean that you can not come here and i can not go there?
not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  accelerated decrepitude. but we do not want to die quite yet.
of course not.
you could help us.
i do not know much about biomechanics, roy.  i wish i did, but you are out of my league.
if we do not find help soon, pris has not got long to live.
what about your friend, the man who owns this building?
dr. tyrell?
he is not really my friend.  i just do a job for him now and then.
tyrell could help us, sebastian.
he could?
his company made us.
I would be happy to mention it to him.
be better if i could talk to him in person.  but he is not an easy man to get to.
no.
when do you deliver your project?
this afternoon.
I am sure glad you found us, sebastian.  what do you think, mary?
i do not think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
pris?
you are our best and only friend.
thank you.
when was the last time you cleaned this place?
hmmm?
have you ever cleaned your apartment?
do not be fooled by appearances.
it appears to be dirty -- why do not you get somebody?
they could clean around the arrangement.
i do not like people snooping around my stuff.
but if i do not plug it in how can i...
never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
but then how can you...
i do not like the noise.  just practice.  practice makes perfect.
this feels stupid.
good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  part of your education.
you are sick, deckard.
i never felt better.
the name is batty.  roy batty.
oh?
yeah.  it might be better if we talk in private, sebastian.  why do not you go home.
here's your check, my boy.  thank you.
I am surprised you did not come to me sooner.
it is not an easy thing to meet your maker.
and what can he do for you?
can the maker repair what he makes?
would you like to be modified?
had in mind something a little more radical.
what is the problem?
death.
I am afraid that is a little out of my...
i want more life, fucker.
come here.
the facts of life.  I will be blunt. to make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  a coding sequence can not be revised once it is established.
why?
because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  the ship sinks.
what about e.m.s. recombination?
we have already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table.
then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
would not obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed dna strand carries a mutation and you are got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
but not to last.
put it this way.  rolls royces are made to last -- as least they were. but I am afraid you are a ferrari. a high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
also you are too valuable to experiment with.
i am?
I have done some questionable things.
also extraordinary things.
nothing the god of biomechanics would not let you in heaven for.
have you ever known anybody a long time?
you mean a woman?
uh-huh.
what is a long time?
ten years.
nope.  nobody could stand me that long.
yeah.
this is bryant.  are you alone?
yeah.
she is not with you?
who.
take a number.  canapt 1700, tenth floor, villa vita district, olympia south.
got it.
okay, here it is.  eldon tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred.  the cat is about to get out of the bag.  pressure is definitely on.  the nexus program is terminated.  when you finish there, locate nexus designated rachael and retire.
if you don't, we will.  it has to be total, deckard.  that is an order from as high as it comes.  got it?
yeah.  i got it.
go.
why do you call it retire, why do not you call it murder?
because it is not.
do not you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
andies only simulate suffering -- if they are programmed for it.
do you think i simulated what happened between us?
no, i don't.
do not leave here.  do not open the door, do not answer the phone.
what difference will it make?
just wait here.
you know what i think?
what?
that some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
let's go while there is still time.
where?
anywhere.
what is the point?
not to be trapped.
you underestimate the trap, mary.
where are you going, sebastian?
just thought i'd...
no, you stay here with us.  out last night together.
one man.  he must be good.
then go get him.
that would not be very sporting.
i want to do it.
okay, but do not kill him.  save a little for everybody.  a masterpiece.
