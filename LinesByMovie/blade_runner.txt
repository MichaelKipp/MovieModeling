i kinda get nervous when i take tests.
don't move.
sorry.
already had i.q. test this year -- but i don't think i never had a...
reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention.  answer quickly as you can.
you're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...
what one?
what?
what desert?
doesn't make any difference what desert -- it's completely hypothetical.
but how come i'd be there?
maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  so you look down and see a tortoise.  it's crawling towards you...
a tortoise.  what's that?
know what a turtle is?
of course.
same thing.
i never seen a turtle.
but i understand what you mean.
you reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, leon.
whatcha mean, i'm not helping?
i mean you're not helping! why is that, leon?
where the hell you been?
you know where i been.  i been on vacation.
next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.
what's up?
holden got hit.
bad?
severed spine.  you'd better get in here.  bryant's waiting for you.
i'll see you in a minute.
six, huh?
five.  three nights ago one of them managed to break into the tyrell corporation.  killed two guards and got as far as the genetic sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
what was he after?
there wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure.  but bio- chemical data and morphology records of the nexus-6 were reported missing.  going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send holden in to run voight-kampff tests on the new employees.  guess he found himself one.
you got a machine on it yet?
we're using esper -- a 231 -- that picked up holden's alarm.  its guess is that all five are in the city.
where do we start?
the tyrell corporation has a demo model.  check it out on the voight-kampff.  there's a chance the nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect.  if that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
what was the cover on the one that got holden?
industrial refuse.
garbage man?
it's gotta be right for my customer.
your customer, eh?
well, when do you get paid?
soon as i finish the job.
when might that be?
day after tomorrow.
oh!  day after tomorrow.
how come you were in my truck?
i was tired and didn't have any place to go.
what's your name?
pris.
mine's j.f. sebastian.
hi.
you want to go home?
i don't have one.
oh.
where are your folks?
they left.
what about friends?
i have some, but i have to find out where they are staying.
we scared each other pretty good didn't we?
we sure did.
i'm hungry, j.f.
i've got stuff.  if you wanna go to my place?
i was hoping you'd say that.
machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  i don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  if that's true, whoever made esper should have been shot.
this is esper and i'm ready.  go ahead please.
you equipped for random questions?
why, yes, of course.
you start.
the five in question are third generation nexus sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  are you with me?
how do i stop one?
unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
okay, but...
i'm coming to that.  vulnerable zone is the base of the skull, the occipital bone.  a direct hit is a positive retirement.
whatcha doin'?
you scared me.
you look... better.
just better.
beautiful.
thanks.
and you live in this building all by yourself?
yeah, i live here pretty much alone right now...
twenty.
what's your problem?
methuselah syndrome.
what's that?
my glands.  they grow old too fast.
is that why you're still here?
yes.  i couldn't pass the test.
ah, you get hold of your friends?
as a matter of fact i did.  they've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
good.
here's something you might find interesting.  they have been built to emulate the human in every way except in its emotional spectrum. however, after a period of time it is only logical that such a 'mechanism' would create its own emotional responses, hate, love, fear, anger, envy.
i know all that.
what about a summary then.
i think we're through for the night.
yes?
do you have something against science?
not if it works.
and what in your estimation works?
the umbrella.
it seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
a humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  if it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
but because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem.  correct, mr. deckard?
it's artificial?
of course not.
are you apprehensive?
why should i be?
for the responsibility of your power.  being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share.
thanks.
black?
please.
is this to be an empathy test?
yes.
capillary dilation of the so-called blush response?  plus fluctuation of the pupil, plus involuntary dilation of the iris?
may i ask a personal question?
go ahead.
have you ever retired a human by mistake?
no.
but in your profession that is a risk.
nothing is infallible, but so far the voight-kampff scale bas been foolproof.
like you said, mr. deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  the voight-kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
one that relies on human interpretation.  where's the subject?
sitting next to you.
i wouldn't accept it.  also, i'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
you have a little boy.  he shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
i'd take him to the doctor.
you're watching t.v. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.
i'd kill it.
in a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
is this testing whether i'm an android or a lesbian?
you show the picture to your husband. he likes it and hangs it on the wall. the girl is lying on a bearskin rug.
you become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.
i'd never get an abortion.
why not?
that would be murder, mr. deckard.
in your opinion.
it would be my child.
sounds like you speaks from experience.
last question.  you're watching an old movie.  it shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.
ugh.
well?
if she is, the machine works.
the machine works.  she is.
how many questions did it take?
thirteen.
she didn't know?
memory implant.  she was programmed. but i think she has transcended her conditioning.  i think she was beginning to suspect.
how many questions does it usually take, mr. deckard?
five, maybe six.
and how is it one man will be able to cover so much ground?
discreetly.
all pertinent information is being fed into your departmental computer, an esper 231 -- i believe -- and a photo over-lay packet is being produced.
let's keep our eyes on the road, deckard.
sorry.
we're going to have to start the sequence again if you don't stay with me, deckard.  concentrate.
how do you know i'm not?
you're not responding to the stimulus.  i can see right here, i'm not getting a reading.
i'm tired of this.
almost through.
nerves of steel.
no rust?
i didn't say that.  your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
meaning?
meaning you don't run as fast as you used to.
during the road test...
yeah?
your mind kept wandering.  that bothered me.
huh huh.
considering the nature of your work, that could be unhealthy.
true.
but you haven't put in for emigration.
nope.
you're going to be over the limit.
listen, i could make you a long list of complaints about this fucken city but i still rather be here than up there.
what if you change your mind?
they'll change the limit before i change my mind.
you sure?
never been more sure of anything in my life.
why didn't you go?
too old.
but if you could?
my job is here.
me too.
what's going on down there?
he's not ready yet.
when?
tomorrow, he says.
is there anything else?
i know you think it complicates your work, but i'm here to help.
i've already got more help than i need.
i think you need more help than you've got.
there's two reasons a man rejects help.  either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
sounds like i'm an ass-hole either way, but the answer is still no.
two of us might be more effective than one.
i work alone.
you use your equipment, don't you?
so?
so, i'm a piece of equipment. use me.
do i make you nervous?
yeah.
i'm sorry.
i can imagine.
can you?  i couldn't.
they probably want to find out when they were made.
right.
yeah.
bryant here.  regarding the rundown you requested on job applicants, esper's concluded that the only irregular category that tyrell's got is the entertainment section.  you better get on it.
i was just about to have my dinner.
if you hurry you'll get back before it gets cold.  i got a spinner on your roof in five minutes.  good luck.
four years.  which would make her termination date...
never mind.  do they have that knowledge?
longevity is classified.  no.
okay, gimme a run-down on the three females.
nexus designated mary:  incept november 1 2017, domestic conditioning non competitive, trained for day care position.
next.
nexus designated pris:  incept data december 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
number three.
nexus designated zhora:  incept june 13th 2017, athletic conditioning, highly competitive, special abilities in the entertainment field.
taffey lewis?
yes?
can i come in?
i'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
of course.
you see i lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... what am i supposed to be looking for?
do you recognize any of them?
this one looks familiar, but i don't know.  naw.  there's one came in today looks a little like this one but...
what did she want?
who?
the girl that doesn't look like that girl.
nothing.  she wanted to know about suck night.
what night?
i didn't know if i wanted to handle her -- i already got a snake act.  but my partner goes down there to the opera house on suck night to book the good ones.
what's suck night?
that's what we call in the trade, audition free-for- alls and most of it sucks. bit i don't think that's her.
you talking about the opera house on the main?
book the good ones for where?
lots of places.  the tours, the clubs, the silicone shows, private parties.
what shows?
silicone valley.  lots of these science guys never leave that place.  we book two shows a month in there. those big time techs and bio- guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.
yeah?
i'm with the american federation of variety artists...
there's been reports of management sexually abusing the artists in this place.
i don't know nothing about it.
you haven't felt yourself to be exploited by the management in any way?
how do you mean 'exploited'?
like to get this position.  did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?
are you for real?
oh, yeah. you'd be surprised what goes on around here.  i'd like to check the dressing room if i could.
what the fuck for?
for holes.
it that mother real?
of course he's not real.  you think i'd be working here if i could afford a real snake?
it's a good job.
you mean the snake.
the best.
does it eat?
come on.
jeezus!
sorry.
hey!  do your job but don't wreck mine, huh?
you'd be surprised what a guy'll go through to get a glimpse of a beautiful body.
i bet i would.
little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.
me.
and who do i go to about you?
she was gonna get away.
then let her get away.  i thought you were a pro -- you're supposed to be a fuckin' tracker!
i didn't like her.
you didn't like her!?
look, go home.  get some rest. take an aspirin.
yeah.
i think i have no money.
it's okay.  forget it.
but i would like to buy you drink.
i'll but you one.  what'll you have?
vodka!
shot of vodka, please.
thank you very much.
my pleasure.
prosit.
prosit.
you want to see my friends?
sorry, don't have the time.
no problem.
those cockroaches?
ya.
how long you had these guys?
two months.  but this one is not guy.  it is girl.  his girl.
prosit.
prosit.
you like to kiss her goodbye.
no thanks.
i like you.
i like you too.
one more, eh?
i gotta piss.
how old am i?
i don't know.
my birthday is april 10, 2015. how long do i live?
four years.
don't just stand there looking at me.  it's not polite.
what do you want me to do?
sit.
you ever take a bath with a man before?
there's a lot i haven't done with a man before.
this is my uncle roy, sebastian.
hello, glad to meet you.
can't thank you enough, mr. sebastian. if you hadn't come along...
we were worried to death.  it's awfully kind of you.
we're not used to the big city. where we come from it's not so easy to get lost.
you certainly have a nice place here.
well stocked.
sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
i keep a lot of provisions right here.
i like a man who stays put.  an admirable thing to be able to sustain yourself in these times. you live here all by yourself, do you?
well, no, not really.  there's mr. deetchum, he's the watchman, he lives on the first floor.
how about breakfast, i was just going to make some.
if it wouldn't be too much of a bother... a little bite to eat would be...
oh, no bother, i'd be glad to.
well, actually
then we're stupid and we'll die.
not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  how are things at home?
he knows what he's doing.
if he won't cooperate?
mr. sebastian is a host who wants to be appreciated.  we'll appreciate him and he'll cooperate.
i'm great.  i mean, i know i'm not really great, but i feel just great.  how you like my new suit?
well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.
don't make me laugh.  it makes me pee.
sorry.
hey, it's okay.  i like to pee. so how are you doing?
i'm doing okay.
from what i hear you're doing great.  bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one-man army.  making a lot of money, huh?
yeah.  but that's what i wanted to talk to you about.
money?
no.  i got a problem.
let's hear it.
i think i'm starting to empathize with these nexus-sixes.
what's that?
i'm taking a piss.
love is just another name for sex. love is sexy and sex is lovely -- i don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.
these aren't just...
i know what they are, deck -- look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart -- no way.
i told you i'd come back.
you did?
you didn't hear me.  you were sleeping.
who is this?
me and my dad.
where is he?
dead.
oh.
how come you're not on the job?
i am.  part of my job is to sit on a couch and try and figure things out.
how are you doing?
not too good.
what do people do in the afternoon?
if they are smart, they take naps.
do you dream?
yeah.  sometimes.
i wish i could.
did you cry when your father died?
yeah.
that's another thing i can't do.
nobody is freer than when he dreams.  i read that.
it wasn't very good last night, was it?
i don't know, i have nothing to compare it to.  i guess i thought there was something more to it.
what?
i don't know... i think i missed something.
like?
i'm not sure.  is there a secret?
why are you staring at us?
you're just all so... so different.
what, sebastian?
you're androids.
what makes you think so?
you're all so perfect.
what generation are you?
nexus - 6.
show me something?
like what?
like...
i think, therefore i am.
very good, pris.  now show him why.
we have a lot in common.
you mean that you can't come here and i can't go there?
not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  accelerated decrepitude. but we don't want to die quite yet.
of course not.
you could help us.
i don't know much about biomechanics, roy.  i wish i did, but you're out of my league.
if we don't find help soon, pris hasn't got long to live.
what about your friend, the man who owns this building?
dr. tyrell?
he's not really my friend.  i just do a job for him now and then.
tyrell could help us, sebastian.
he could?
his company made us.
i'd be happy to mention it to him.
be better if i could talk to him in person.  but he's not an easy man to get to.
no.
when do you deliver your project?
this afternoon.
i'm sure glad you found us, sebastian.  what do you think, mary?
i don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
pris?
you're our best and only friend.
thank you.
when was the last time you cleaned this place?
hmmm?
have you ever cleaned your apartment?
don't be fooled by appearances.
it appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
they could clean around the arrangement.
i don't like people snooping around my stuff.
but if i don't plug it in how can i...
never mind the plug, just go through the motions.
but then how can you...
i don't like the noise.  just practice.  practice makes perfect.
this feels stupid.
good for a smart girl to feel stupid.  part of your education.
you're sick, deckard.
i never felt better.
the name is batty.  roy batty.
oh?
yeah.  it might be better if we talk in private, sebastian.  why don't you go home.
here's your check, my boy.  thank you.
i'm surprised you didn't come to me sooner.
it's not an easy thing to meet your maker.
and what can he do for you?
can the maker repair what he makes?
would you like to be modified?
had in mind something a little more radical.
what's the problem?
death.
i'm afraid that's a little out of my...
i want more life, fucker.
come here.
the facts of life.  i'll be blunt. to make an alteration in the evolvement of an organic life system, at least by men, makers or not, it fatal.  a coding sequence can't be revised once it's established.
why?
because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  the ship sinks.
what about e.m.s. recombination?
we've already tried it -- ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen -- it creates a virus so lethal the subject was destroyed before we left the table.
then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.
wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed dna strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic -- you are made as good as we could make you.
but not to last.
put it this way.  rolls royces are made to last -- as least they were. but i'm afraid you're a ferrari. a high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
also you're too valuable to experiment with.
i am?
i've done some questionable things.
also extraordinary things.
nothing the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven for.
have you ever known anybody a long time?
you mean a woman?
uh-huh.
what's a long time?
ten years.
nope.  nobody could stand me that long.
yeah.
this is bryant.  are you alone?
yeah.
she's not with you?
who.
take a number.  canapt 1700, tenth floor, villa vita district, olympia south.
got it.
okay, here it is.  eldon tyrell, his family and half his staff were just massacred.  the cat is about to get out of the bag.  pressure is definitely on.  the nexus program is terminated.  when you finish there, locate nexus designated rachael and retire.
if you don't, we will.  it has to be total, deckard.  that's an order from as high as it comes.  got it?
yeah.  i got it.
go.
why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
because it's not.
don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
do you think i simulated what happened between us?
no, i don't.
don't leave here.  don't open the door, don't answer the phone.
what difference will it make?
just wait here.
you know what i think?
what?
that some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
let's go while there is still time.
where?
anywhere.
what's the point?
not to be trapped.
you underestimate the trap, mary.
where are you going, sebastian?
just thought i'd...
no, you stay here with us.  out last night together.
one man.  he must be good.
then go get him.
that wouldn't be very sporting.
i want to do it.
okay, but don't kill him.  save a little for everybody.  a masterpiece.
