hmm?
he is three. why do not you wait till he is a little older?
he used to know me.
sorry, alan it is been six years.
so, mark's working at the state department now.
really?  what do you do there?
anything good?
raptors, mostly.
my favorite.
you remember the sounds they made?
i try not to.
we have done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. i have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. the way they can work together as a team.
you think they could talk to each other?
to a degree we never imagined.
good luck with the fund raising.
it was never easy, but before jurassic park, you could find money. somewhere. now fossils are out. everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.
times change alan. but you are the still the best. i mean that.
the last of my breed.
I would better get going.
let me know if i can help, alan. youre bad about asking for help, but please ask me. anything, anytime.
okay. goodbye, ellie.
goodbye, alan.
when i met you, i thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. wiped out. but you told me otherwise. when conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. they became other things. they evolved.
a well-accepted theory.
alan do not be afraid to evolve.
how was your trip? profitable?
we will be broke in four weeks.
three weeks. i had to rent some equipment.
you rented an automated litter box.
it is a rapid prototyper. i feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. it is the future of paleontology.
not if it can not dig.
absolutely not.
they are here.
what?
what can i do for you, mr. kirby?
well sir, i am a great admirer of yours, and i have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. would you let my wife and i take you to have dinner tonight? our treat.
you know, I have been traveling and I am very tired. maybe some other time.
i guarantee it will be worth your while.
first off let me say as a dinosaur enthusiasts, amanda and i have admired your work for years.
it is truly, whats the word? inspiring.
amanda and i, well, we just love the outdoors. heck we have been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: galapagos, k2, the nile...
we even have two seats reserved aboard the first commercial moon flight.
hmmm.
now, for our wedding anniversary this year we wanted to do something really special, something...
...once-in-a-lifetime.
we have arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over isla sorna. and we want you to be our guide.
that is a very nice offer, mr. kirby, but I am afraid I am much to busy. if you like i can refer you to a number of highly qualified...
no, no, see dr. grant, you are the best. you have seen these animals in the flesh. no one else has come close to you.
I am flattered, but I have taken this little adventure tour. and with the air restrictions they have imposed after the incident in san diego, you cant fly low enough to see anything of interest.
you see, that is just the thing. paul and i have special permission to fly low.
how low?
well, I am no aviation specialist. but i do know it is hell of a lot lower than anyone else.
from what i understand, it is pretty much whatever we want.
that is hard to believe.
let's just say that through my business -- imports/exports, emerging markets -- I have made some friends in high places. in this case, the costa rican government.
even with what i pay you, you could get a better bag.
no way. this is lucky. couple years ago some buddies and i went hang gliding off these cliffs in new zealand. updraft sent me right into the side. boom!
that does sound lucky.
it was this strap alone that saved my life. got caught on a rock as i was falling.
reverse-darwinism. survival of the most idiotic.
listen alan, i really appreciate you bringing me along.
the bones will be there when we get back. that is the nice thing about them. they never run away.  and besides, you got me into this. i do not intend to be alone with these people.
I am so use to seeing bones. it is weird to see skin.
mr. and mrs. kirby! if you look out the right you can see...
dr. grant if you would just sit tight, we will explain this all in a jiffy.
this plane can not land!
what the hell is going on? what are they doing?
establishing a perimeter. making it safe. these guys are really good. one of them was a green...
mr. kirby, trust me, on this island, there is no such thing as safe. we have to get back in this plane...
errr-iiic!
and tell your wife to stop making so much noise! we are food to these damn animals.
amanda, honey! dr. grant says it is a bad idea!
what?
he says it is a bad idea!
what is a bad idea?
is it a rex?
i do not think so.
we can not just...
do not worry, honey. we will circle around and come back.
he is with a man named ben hildebrand.
who is that?
her new boyfriend.
a friend. we were vacationing. eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. they never came back.
we called everyone, did everything we could. because of all the controversy over this island, no one will step in. costa rica says it is a no-fly zone, it is their own damn fault. guys at the u.s embassy -- our u.s. embassy -- said we should "accept the inevitable." you believe that?
we needed somebody who knew the lay of the land. somebody who would been to this island before.
i have never been on this island!
sure you have. you wrote that book...
that was isla nublar. this is isla sorna. the second island.
i did not know, there were two islands.
still, you have survived the dinosaurs before. you saved those kids.
a few of us survived. a lot more died. and we were better prepared and better armed.  how many days have they been missing?
after what you have seen today, you really think your son could be alive?
he is smart, dr. grant. and he knows so much about dinosaurs.
no, I am sorry, but no. we will savage what we can from the plane. then we head for the coast. there may be a boat left, something to get us off this island.
dr. grant, we are not leaving without our son.
you can stick with us, or you can go and look for him. either way you are probably not getting out of here alive.
sorry.
nothing you have not seen before.
how much weight have you lost?
twenty, twenty-fire pounds. I have been swimming at the y.
you hate to swim.
people change.
you look good.
so do you.
how would you classify it?
obviously a superpredator.  suchimimus. that snout.
they never got that big.
baryonyx?
not with that sail.  spinosaurus aegypticus.
i do not remember that on ingen's list.
that is because it was not on their list. who knows what else they were up to?
so mr. kirby, tell me, when you climbed k2, did you base camp at 25- or 30,000 feet?
thirty-thousand, i think. closer to the top.
about a thousand feet above it, actually.  most mountain-climbers remember how tall that mountains were.
there is no kirby enterprises, is there?
there is. i own a place called kirby paint and title plus. we are out in the westgate shopping center in enid, oklahoma. the "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. stuff like that.
eric!
quiet!
stop that. dr. grant says this is dangerous territory.
well we should split up or something. we can cover twice the area.
no, dr. grant says...
dr. grant says this, dr. grant says that...
well what is the use of hiring an expert if your not going to listen to him?
because "dr. grant" is not looking for eric. dr. grant is looking for the coast.
fine...and when the tricyclatops comes after you, do not come crying to me.
oh, do not worry about that.
what?
nothing.
what did you say?
nothing.
what did you say!
just drop it paul!
young adult.
eric...
it looks intact.
we should take it with us to signal any planes.
that is him. thats eric!
i filmed this the morning they left.
I am sorry amanda. i am. and I am sorry for the things i said about him.
no, it's...
i know you liked ben. i had no right to...
its not about him. it is eric. he is alone out here somewhere. our baby is all alone.
well that is good.
but you never came across just one.
i thought we were not suppose to yell.
here!
we could co-write a paper.
ah yes, the first rule of academics. publish or perish.
eric! are you here?
eric!
this is how you make dinosaurs?
this is how you play god.
amanda!
back out! move!
alan!
keep going!
udesky.
he is this way.
it is not safe.
we have to help him.
he is right. a predator would not leave a kill wounded.
he is not a kill, he is still alive.
they couldnt climb up, so they were trying to get us to come down.
they set a trap  they actually set a trap.
eric, your parents are both here.
in costa rica?
on the island.
they will never make it. i mean, they can not manage when the cable goes out.
you would be surprised what people can do when they have too.
you are alan grant, are not you?  i read both of your books.
which one do you prefer?
the first one. before you where on the island. you liked dinosaurs back then.
back then, they had not tried to eat me.
when ingen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.
any weapons, radios?
found this, but the battery's dead.
it is a wonder you aren't. I am amazed, eric. i barely lasted 30 hours. you lasted eight weeks.
is that all it is been? i thought it was longer.
the important thing is we both made it. that is something we have in common.
did you read malcolm's book?
yeah.
what did you think?
i dunno. i mean, it was kind of preachy. chaos-this, chaos-that. and like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself.
we can not just stop looking. eric and dr. grant are out there somewhere.
i want to find them too, but we can not do a bit of good right now. for every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I will bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  am i right?
i dont know.
i thought you were an expert.
dr. grant was.
well what?
well damn it. i do not speak ill of the dead. what I am trying to say is, its was just a crazy accident. the exact same thing could have happened if he was with me. you can not go beating yourself up about it.
this would not happen if he was with you. i mean, you drive five miles below the speed limit. i totaled three cars in fives years.
that one time was just the bumper.
he would have been, safe. completely, entirely, suffocatingly safe.  i would have him to see more of the world than enid, oklahoma. i wanted to see more of the world than enid, oklahoma. and so yes, it is my fault that this happened. I am sorry that you have to be here.
know what this is?
a raptor claw. i use to have one. a fossil.
mine's new.
how much of this island have you explored?
i stayed pretty close to the compound, figured if anyone came to look for me, that is where they would start.
we need to head for the coast.
are you sure?
why?
closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
we need to stick to the plan. head for the coast.
what about eric and dr. grant?
going to the coast was alan's idea. if he is alive, thats where he is headed.
what about eric?
he is probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  right?
sure.
you had the phone the whole time?
where is it?
i do not know. i do not have it with me.
when did you have it last?
i do not remember
think.
what?...what!?
i loaned it to nash. he must have had it on him when he...
sweetheart, you are okay.  you are okay.  you are okay.
never had a doubt. never did. us kirby men, we stick around, huh?
we need to keep moving.
alan, i want to tell you that I am so sorry about the...
billy, i can not talk to you now.
you have to believe me. i did it with the best intentions.
some of the worst things imaginable have been done with the best intentions. you rushed in with no thought to the consequences, to yourself or anyone else.  you are no better than the people who built this place.
we climb down to the barge and follow the river out to the ocean. with any luck, the costa rican coast guard will pick us up.
then we go home?
do you think it goes all the way across?
one way to find out.
eric, its okay. you will be right behind me.
we are not going anywhere, i promise.
oh, my god.
what is it?
a bird cage.
eric!
it will not hold!
paul! where is he? can you see him?
I am trying! that thing took him down this way!
i can get him!
no!
i know the consequences!
billy!
it is no use, dr. grant. no use.
my own kid was right in front of me and i did not do a damn thing.
you could not have made that jump.
i should have tried. it should have been me on that beach back there, not billy.
how would you have helped eric?  he needs you, paul. he needs us.
he could have died.
but he didn't. and neither did you. and I am glad about that.
do you have any kids?
no. although I have studied them in the wild.
i have a theory that there is two kinds of boys. those who want to be astronomers and those who want to be astronauts.
i want to be an astronaut.
see, i was the opposite. i never understood why anyone would want to go into space. it is so dangerous. you do one thing wrong and you are dead. the astronomer -- or the paleontologist -- get to study these amazing things from a place of complete safety. and truthfully, everything you really need to learn, you can learn it from the ground.
but then you never get to go in space.
exactly. the difference between imagining how things might be and seeing how they really are. to be able to touch them. that is what billy wanted to do.
whatever you do, do not call the u.s. embassy. they will not do a god damn thing.
well, we do not exactly have a costa rican phone book here, so it will have to be somebody we know in the states. someone we can absolutely count on to send help.
stan.
bonitas.
something must have scared them.
paul!
dad!
where is dad?
just hold on.
we have to keep looking for dad. we have to.
i know. i know. i want to look for him too.
then we should...
let me tell you a few things about you dad, okay? he is very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
he loves you too.
okay. he loves us very very much. and i know that right now more than anything, your dad would want to know that we are safe. okay?
we should try fishing again.
you mean it?
i do. it is worth another shot. and who knows? things might turn out differently.
the lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
she is the one person i could always count on. and she is saved me more times than she realizes. i owe her everything.
it is strikes me now i never told her that.
you should.
you are right.
eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? why did it crash?
no. i could not see.
do me a favor. go back to your parents for a minute, would you?  they look worried.
we are safe!
no we are not.
what do you think is going to happen with the dinosaurs?
the population will stabilize eventually. they will adapt to fit different roles.
either that, or the government will firebomb it back to the stone age.
i would completely support that.
