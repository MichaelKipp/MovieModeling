oh, hi.
hi, i was in the neighborhood and thought I would see --
i think he is in a conference. unfortunately. I am really sorry.
would you just try him? you never know. as long as I am here. you never know.
of course. please have a seat.
this book -- it is essential that people read it because --  -- it is the truth. and only i know it.
maybe after the holidays then.
may i help you?
yeah, hi, i have a one of the clock with dr. mierzwiak. clementine kruczynski.
yes, please have a seat. he will be right with you.
howard, your one o'clock.
thanks, mary. you can bring her in.
mary...
yes?
order me a pastrami for after?
cole slaw, ice tea?
thanks.
welcome, howard.
boo.
hi.
stan... c'mon...
sorry. i just --
it is just... y'know... i mean...
i know. anyway --
anyway, I have got to do my tap dance here.
see you later, alligator.
'kay.
hey, if you are ordering lunch for mierzwiak, would you --
i better do this, stan.
ms. kruczynski?
hi.
how are you today?
okay, i guess.
here we are.
how are you today?
okay, i guess.
well, why do not you tell me what is going on? do you mind if i turn this on?
well, I have been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, i guess.
you guess he is your boyfriend? or you guess you are having a bad time with him?
what? no. i do not like the term boyfriend. it is so gay.
maybe gay is not the right word. but, anyway, it is been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. heheh. my significant other... heh heh. and i guess on a certain level, i want to break it off, but i feel... y'know... it is like this constant questioning and re questioning. do i end it? should i give it more time? I am not happy, but what do i expect? relationships require work. you know the drill. the thing that i keep coming back to is, I am not getting any younger, i want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? so then i think i should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- i mean, he is a good guy. it is not really settling. then i think maybe I am just a victim of movies, y'know? that i have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. but then i think, no, this is what i really want, so i should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. you know? agreed? but then i think he is a good guy and... it is complicated. y'know?
i think i know. i think we can help. why do not you start by telling me about your relationship. everything you can think of. everything about him. everything about you. and we will take it from there.
I am sorry.
why?
why what?
why are you sorry? i just said hi.
no, i did not know if you were talking to me, so...
really?
well, i did not want to assume.
aw, c'mon, live dangerously. take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
anyway. sorry. hi.
it is okay if i sit closer? so i do not have to scream. not that i do not need to scream sometimes, believe me.  but i do not want to bug you if you are trying to write or something.
no, i mean, i do not know. i can not really think of much to say probably.
oh. so...
i mean, it is okay if you want to sit down here. i did not mean to --
no, i do not want to bug you if you are trying to --
it is okay, really.
just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. i have a long trip ahead of me.  how far are you going? on the train, i mean, of course.
rockville center.
get out! me too! what are the odds?
the weirder part is i think actually i recognize you. i thought that earlier in the diner. that is why i was looking at you. you work at borders, right?
ucch, really? you are kidding. god. bizarre small world, huh? yeah, that is me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
really? because --
jesus, is it five years? i gotta quit right now.
-- because i go there all the time. i do not think i ever saw you before.
well, I am there. i hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. you have a cell phone? i need to quit right this minute. I will call in dead.
i do not have one.
I will go on the dole. like my daddy before me.
i noticed your hair. i guess it made an impression on me, that is why i was pretty sure i recognized you.
ah, the hair.  blue, right? it is called blue ruin. the color. snappy name, huh?
i like it.
blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
yeah. tom waits says it in --
exactly! tom waits. which song?
i can not remember.
anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. red menace, yellow fever, green revolution. that would be a job, coming up with those names. how do you get a job like that? that is what I will do. fuck the dole.
i do not really know how --
purple haze, pink eraser.
you think that could possibly be a full time job? how many hair colors could there be?
someone is got that job.  agent orange! i came up with that one. anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I would be great at it.
I am sure you would.
my writing career! your hair written by clementine kruczynski.  the tom waits album is rain dogs.
you sure? that does not sound --
i think. anyway, I have tried all their colors. more than once. I am getting too old for this. but it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. i apply my personality in a paste. you?
oh, i doubt that is the case.
well, you do not know me, so... you do not know, do you?
sorry. i was just trying to be nice.
yeah, i got it.
my name's clementine, by the way.
I am joel.
no jokes about my name? oh, you would not do that; you are trying to be nice.
i do not know any jokes about your name.
huckleberry hound?
i do not know what that means.
huckleberry hound! what, are you nuts?
I am not nuts.
oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' clementine? no?
sorry. it is a pretty name, though. it means "merciful", right?
yeah. although it hardly fits. I am a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
see, i would not think that about you.
why would not you think that about me?
oh. i do not know. i was just... i do not know. i was... you seemed nice, so --
now I am nice? do not you know any other adjectives? there is careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
well, anyway... sorry.
i do not need nice. i do not need myself to be it and i do not need anyone else to be it at me.
okay.
shit. shit. i know it is here. hold on.
joel? it is joel, right?
yes?
I am sorry i... yelled at you. was it yelling? i can not really tell. whatever, I am a little out of sorts today.
that is okay.
my embarrassing admission is i really like that you are nice. right now, anyway. i can not tell from one moment to the next what I am going to like. but right now I am glad you said, "that's okay" to me. that was nice of you.
it is no problem. anyway, i have some stuff i need to --
oh, okay. well, sure, I will just...  take care, then.
probably see you at the book store.
unless i get that hair-color-naming job.
hi. i could give you a ride if you need.
no, that is okay. thanks, though.
you are sure? it is cold.
i do not want to take you out of your way.
it is okay.
yeah?
where do you live?
you are not a stalker or anything, right?
well, i probably would not say if i were, but no.
you can not be too careful. I have been stalked. I have been told I am highly stalkable. i do not need that.
I am not a stalker.
you know wilmont?
yeah.
wilmont. near the high school.
look, I am very sorry i came off sort of nutso. I am not really.
it is okay. i did not think you were.
so you like bookstores, huh?
i like to read.
me too. it is rain dogs, by the way.
yeah? i can not remember that album very well. i remember liking it. but --
the song's 9th and hennepin. i spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "till you are full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/and you spill out/over the side to anyone who will listen." remember?
sort of, um...
remember? "and you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/and I am lost in the window/i hide on the stairway/i hang in the curtain/i sleep in your hat..."  oh, shit. I am so stupid. sorry.
what?
I am just a bit of a wreck. "i sleep in your hat" makes me cry.  me.
thanks very much. that was very nice of you.
well, i would not want to be --
oh, geez, I am full of shit. i already told you that.  anyway. see ya.
take care.
hey, do you want to have a drink? i have lots of drinks. and i could --
um --
never mind. sorry, that was stupid. I am embarrassed. good night, joel.
you like that?
very much.
this... someone gave that to me, just like, recently. i like it, too. i like crows. i think i used to be a crow.
thanks. that was good, that crow sound.
do you believe in that stuff? reincarnation?
i do not know.
me neither. oh, there is an inscription on the back.  the way a crow/shook down on me/the dust of snow/from a hemlock tree/has given my heart/a change of mood/and saved some part/of a day i rued.
frost?
yeah. I am not, like, a robert frost lover by any stretch. his stuff seems strictly grade school to me. but this made me cry for some reason. maybe because it is grade school. y'know?
it is pretty.
i miss grade school. i do not know why I am calling it grade school all of a sudden. when i went we called it elementary school. but i like grade school better. sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I would like to be from then. everyone wore hats. anyway, cheers!
cheers.
god, that feels so fucking good. take yours off.
I am fine.
yeah? well, have a seat, anyway.
ready for another?
no, I am okay for now.
what do you want to hear?
you pick it.
you just say. I am not really --
i do not know! i can not see them from here, joel! just pick something good.
well, i should probably get going.
no, stay. just for a little while.  refill?
no. i --
i know a man who needs a refill.
thanks.
drink up, young man. it will make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
y'know, I am sort of psychic.
yeah?
well, i go to a psychic and she is always telling me I am psychic. she should know. do you believe in that stuff?
i do not know.
me neither. but sometimes i have premonitions, so, i do not know. maybe that is just coincidence. right? y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? y'know?
yeah, i do not know. it is hard to know.
exactly. exactly! that is exactly my feeling about it. it is hard to know. like, okay, but how many times do i think something and it does not happen? that is what you are saying, right? you forget about those times. right?
yeah, i guess.
but i think i am. i like to think i am.
it is helpful to think there is some order to things. you are kind of closed mouthed, are not you?
sorry. my life is not that interesting. i go to work. i go home. i do not know what to say.
oh.  does that make you sad? or anxious? I am always anxious thinking I am not living my life to the fullest, y'know? taking advantage of every possibility? just making sure that I am not wasting one second of the little time i have.
i think about that.
you are really nice. I am sorry i yelled at you before about it. god, I am an idiot.
i do have a tendency to use that word too much.
i like you. that is the thing about my psychic thing. i think that is my greatest psychic power, that i get a sense about people. my problem is i never trust it. but i get it. and with you i get that you are a really good guy.
thanks.
and, anyway, you sell yourself short. i can tell. there is a lot of stuff going on in your brain. i can tell. my goal... can i tell you my goal?
yeah.
what is the goal, joel?  my goal, joel, is to just let it flow through me? do you know what i mean? it is like, there is all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and i think we are all taught we should be consistent. y'know? you love someone -- that is it. forever. you choose to do something with your life -- that is it, that is what you do. it is a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. and my feeling is that is how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. you know?
yeah. i think so. it is hard to --
like i wanted to talk to you. i did not need any more reason to do it. who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
yeah.
you are very nice. god, i have to stop saying that. you are nervous around me, huh?
no.
I am nervous. you do not need to be nervous around me, though. i like you. do you think I am repulsively fat?
no, not at all.
i do not either. i used to. but I am through with that. y'know, if i do not love my body, then I am just lost. you know? with all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that is coming 'round the bend.  so, I have been seeing this guy...
well, for the last week, anyway! he is kind of a kid. kind of a goofball, but he is really stuck on me, which is flattering. who would not like that? and he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. he is the one who gave me that crow photograph.
oh, yeah.
that made me cry. but, anyway, we went up to boston, because i had this urge to lie on my back on the charles river. it gets frozen this time of year.
that is scary sounding.
exactly! i used to do it in college and i had this urge to go do it again, so i got patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but i was really disappointment to be there with him. y'know? and that is where psychic stuff comes in. like, it just is not right with him. y'know?
i think so.
i do not believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. we like the same writers. this writer stephen dixon he turned me on to. and he is cute. it is fucked up. joel, you should come up to the charles with me sometime.
okay.
yeah? oh, great!
I will pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
sounds good. but right now i should go.
you should stay.
i have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
okay.
i would like you to call me. would you do that? i would like that.
yes.
so, i enjoyed meeting you.
you will call me, right?
yeah.
when?
tomorrow?
tonight. just to test out the phone lines and all.
okay.
it was snowing.
there are two of them. could not make them out. the orange glow of a cigarette.
the driver waved. so casual, friendly.
I am like a joke to them.
i might be making a mistake.
maybe I am making a mistake. maybe i just need to learn to live with this. first of all, I will get over it. secondly, it happened. those who do not remember history are condemned to repeat it. who said that? churchill? I am not sure. but i do not care. she did it to me. i have to rid myself of this. fuck her.
fuck you, clementine.
pink.  there was a number on it. i remember. al 1718?  i have to follow through with this. i have no choice.
the pill was pink, i remember. it had some letters and numbers on it. what were they? al 1718? al something. four digits. i do not like taking pills when i do not know what they are. i have no choice.
it is them.
it is too late.
i should maybe talk to you.
clementine. i should just maybe talk to her.
i love you and if you knew that... if i told you what happened... I will explain everything, what we meant to each other. I will tell you everything about our time together. you will know everything again and...
maybe if i just explain what happened, i would not have to go through this and i could tell you everything and it would be like you knew and we could rebuild and we could be happy again and...
clementine.
that is your look for me.
i just thought I would say hi. i was in the neighborhood.
you were not.
i was not.
come over after I am done here?
i can't. i want to, but i have to study.
you rat.
i really want to, but tonight's important. test tomorrow.
how could she have done this to me? how could anyone do this to anyone?
you did not say anything about my hair.
it is so cool. you are by far the most sensational person in the room.
in the room?
in the world.
gotta get home. how could she do this to me? how could she not care about what we meant to each other. what a fuck! what a fucking monster she is!
oh, god. i miss her. i can not believe she is with that guy now! I am never going to see her again. i love her so much. what a fucking monster she is!
we will start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- there is an emotional core to each of our memories -- as we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- by the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we have targeted will have withered and disappeared. like a dream upon waking.
is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. nothing you will miss.
the voltage looks fine.
then check the connections.
does that help?
yeah, that looks better. thanks.
ah, your journal. this will be invaluable.
december 15th, 2004. i met someone tonight. oh, christ: i do not know what to do. her name is clementine and she is amazing. so alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. things with naomi and i have been stagnant for so long.
I am sorry you saw one of our notification cards. you never should have.
well... i did.
we can help you through this. why do not you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with clementine.
it was a mess. i do not know how it got this way...
it is an apartment.
not a dump, then, but kind of plain. uninspired. and there is a stale smell. sort of stuffy. i do not know. stuffy.
patrick, let's just get through this. we have a long night ahead of us.
yeah.
so then she just stops calling.
i was not going to call her. not after the way she was.
any messages, carmen?
i do not know, honey. it is horrible.
she is punishing me for being honest. i should just go to her house.
maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on. just make a clean break.
i do not know. I am so... i can not believe she would be so goddamn immature!
you were not supposed to see that.
they can not erase memories. it is a joke. it is a nasty clementine hoax.
sweetie, we called the company.
yeah?
just wanted to let you know.
i like mary. i like when she comes to visit. i just do not think she likes me.
she likes you okay.
i wonder if i should invite my girlfriend over, too. i have a girlfriend now.
you can if you want.
did i tell you i have a new girlfriend?
this one's history. moving on...
the thing is... my situation is a little weird. my girlfriend situation.
patrick, we need to focus.
yo ho ho!
it is three.
shit. the last time i saw you.
anyhoo, sweetie, i done a bad thing. i kinda sorta wrecked your car...
i can not believe you wrecked my car. you are driving drunk. it is pathetic.
...a little. i was a little tipsy. do not call me pathetic.
well it is pathetic. and fucking irresponsible. you could have killed somebody.
i do not know, maybe you did kill somebody.
oh christ i did not kill anybody. it is just a fucking dent. you are like some old lady or something.
right! she called me an old lady here, too! and i remember, i said...
and what are you like? a wino?
a wino? jesus, are you from the fifties? a wino!  face it, joel. you are freaked out because i was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you are trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
no, see, clem, i assume you fucked someone tonight. is not that how you get people to like you?
let me drive you home.
fuck you, joel. faggot.
look at it out here. it is falling apart. I am erasing you. and I am happy.
i gotta tell you something. i kind of fell in love with her last night.
she was unconscious, patrick.
she was beautiful. so sweet and funky and voluptuous. i kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
jesus, patrick!
how can you watch this crap?
where are you going?
I am fucking crawling out of my skin.
oh shit. i remember this.  want to go?
i want to have a baby.
let's talk about it later.
no. i want to have a baby. i have to have a baby.
i do not think we are ready.
you are not ready.
clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
what?!
i do not want to talk about this here.
joel, we are fucking going to talk about it!
you can not fucking say something like that and say you do not want to talk about it!
clem, I am sorry. i should not have --
I would make a fucking good mother! i love children! I am creative and smart and I would make a fucking good mother!
oh, thank god. it is going.
it is you! it is you who can not commit to anything! you have no idea how lucky you are I am interested in you! i do not even know why i am! i should just end it right here, joel. leave you in the zoo. maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
so, um --
would you get me another, joely?
you are drunk.
you are a whiz kid. so perceptive, so --
oh, hey, patrick.
hi, mary. how is it going?
it is freezing out.
you found us okay?
yeah.  poor guy.  have anything to drink?
we have not checked.
well, allow me to do the honors. it is fucking freezing and i need something.
mary hates me. I have never been popular with the ladies.
maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
okay, there is more, stan --
oh, patrick, you did not want any, did you?
nah, i do not know.
nietzsche. beyond good and evil. found it my bartletts.
that is a good one.
yeah, i can not wait to tell howard! it seems really appropriate.
it is a good one all right.
what is your bartlett's?
it is a quote book.
i love quotes. so did winston churchill. he actually has a quotation in bartlett's about bartlett's. is not that trippy?
yeah. cool.
"the quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
very cool. trippy.
i like to read what smart people say. so many beautiful, important things.
yup.
do not you think howard's like that? smart? important?
yup.
definitely!
i think he will be in bartlett's one day.
you do not tell me things, joel. I am an open book. i tell you everything. every damn embarrassing thing. you do not trust me.
no, it is not that.
i want to know you.
i just do not have anything very interesting about my life.
joel, you are a liar.
how is the chicken?
is that like us? are we just bored with each other?
more?
no. thanks.
hold on. let me ask my friend.  stan, can i leave for a little while? my girlfriend is very --
patrick, we are in the middle of --
she is right in the neighborhood. she is upset.
let him go, stan. i can help.
go.
joely...
yeah, tangerine?
do you know the velveteen rabbit?
no.
it is my favorite book. since i was a kid. it is about these toys. there is this part where the skin horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  i can not believe I am crying already. he says, "it takes a long time. that is why it does not often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. generally by the time you are real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. but these things do not matter at all, because once you are real you can not be ugly, except to people who do not understand."
it is amazing, is not it? such a gift howard gave the world.
yeah.
to let people begin again. it is beautiful. you look at a baby and it is so fresh, so clean, so free. and adults... they are like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. and howard just makes it go away.
you love him, do not you?
oh, baby, what is going on?
i do not know. I am lost. I am scared. i feel like I am disappearing. I am getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
oh, tangerine.
nothing makes any sense. nothing makes any sense.
come up to boston with me?
sure. we will go next weekend and --
now. now! i have to go now. i have to see the frozen charles! now! tonight!
um, okay. I will call my study partner.
yay! it will be great! I will get my shit.
i can handle it. he is pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
thanks, stan. i owe you.
we can help you through this. why do not you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
you have to stop this!
what? what do you mean?
I am trapped in my head and everything i love is being erased! stop it now!
yes, but... I am just something you are imagining. what can i do? I am in your head, too.
I am so excited. yay!
I am excited, too. oh, and i wanted to give you this. it is a little... thing.
i did not have a chance to wrap it.
it is gorgeous.  just my taste. I have never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry i liked.  thanks. so let's get going. long drive.
such a beautiful view.
yes indeed.  fuck! they are erasing you, clem!
oh?
i hired them to. we are in my brain. but i want it to stop, before i wake up and do not know you anymore.
wow. um, well... can not you just force yourself awake?
i do not know.
she is so sexy.
i loved you on this day. i love this memory. the rain. us just hanging.
what if you hide me?
what do you mean?
well... if they are looking for me in memories I am in, what if you take me to a memory I am not in?  and we can hide there till morning.
i want my mommy.  i do not want to lose you, clem.
I am right here.
I am scared. i want my mommy. i do not want to lose you. i do not want to lose...
joel, joely, look... it is not fading. the memory. i think we are hidden.
it is stopped.
what?
listen, it is not erasing.
it is not erasing. he is off the screen.
where?
i do not know. he is not on the map.
i do not know what to do! i do not know what to do! crap. crap...
well, what should we do?
i do not know! i just said that!
sor-ry  we have to do something. he can not wake up half done.
shit!
no way. i can handle this.
this guy's only half cooked. there is no time to fuck around, stan.
stan? what is going on?
the guy we are doing? he is disappeared from the map. i can not find him anywhere.
okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
i was away from the monitor for a second. i had it on automatic. i had to go pee.
well, where was patrick?
he went home sick.
jesus. all right, what is the address.
1062 sherman drive. apartment 1e, rockville center.
he is coming?
you better go.
hell no.
you know, we are okay. they are not finding us. you will remember me in the morning. and you will come to me and tell me about us and we will start over.
i loved you so much this day. on my bed in your panties. i remember i thought, how impossibly lucky am i to have you on my bed in your panties.
you remember what happened next?
i came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. and i climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
-- another rainy day. whatever shall we do?
there is this guy!
what?
there is this guy. i heard him talking in my apartment. he is one of the eraser guys. and he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you are dating him.
really? is he cute?
he stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
gross! you must remember to tell me this in the morning. i'm, like, so freaked out now.
what is wrong with me?
nothing is wrong with you. you are the most wonderful person I have ever met.
mary. what are you doing here?
she came to help, howard.
i tried that already.
did you try going through c-gate?
yeah. of course.
okay, we are back in.
that was beautiful to watch, howard. like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
well, thank you, mary.
you get some sleep, howard. I will take it from here.
yeah, probably a good idea.
but can not you see... i love you, antoine.
do not call me antoine. my name is wally.
yes, but i can not love a man named wally.
they found us before. the plan did not work. i do not know what to do now.
hide me somewhere deeper? somewhere buried?
howard, they have disappeared again.
oh dear.
look at you, cutey! what are we doing?
this kid, joe early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
joel!
i do not like it either, but I am just trying to find horrible secret place to --
happy birthday.
thanks, joely. a present! oh boy!
i scoured the city for it.
i love it!
i can't. i have to go home. I will do it later.
i did not want to do this. but i had to or they would have called me a girl.
I will go out for a smoke. if no one minds.
that is fine, stan.
do you like quotes, howard?
how do you mean?
oh, um, like famous quotes. i find reading them inspirational to me. and in my reading I have come across some i thought you might like, too.
oh. well, I would love to hear some.
okay, um, there is one that goes "blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
is that nietzsche?
yeah, yeah it is, howard. and here i was thinking i could tell you something you did not know.
it is a good quote, mary. I am glad we both know it.
there is another one i like, i read. it is by pope alexander.
alexander pope?
yes, shit. oops, sorry!  sorry. it is just i told myself i was not going to say pope alexander and sound like a dope and then i go ahead and do it. like i psyched myself out.
it is no big deal.
you are such a sweetheart.
that is lovely.
really? i thought it was appropriate maybe. that is all.  i really admire the work that you do. i know it is not proper to be so familiar but i guess since we are outside the workplace i feel a certain liberty to --
it is fine, mary. I am happy to hear it.
okay. good. great. thanks.  i like you, howard... an awful lot. is that terrible?
I have loved you for a very long time. I am sorry! i should not have said that.
I have got a wife, mary. kids. you know that.
i wish i was your wife. i wish i had your kids.
we can not do this.
no you are right. once again. you are a decent man, howard.
what, howard?
we... have a history. I am sorry. you wanted the procedure. you wanted it done... to get past. i have to finish in there. it is almost morning. we will talk later.
I am done, clem. I am just going to ride it out. hiding is clearly not working.
yeah.
i want to enjoy my little time left with you.
this is our first "date" date.
do you remember what we talked about?
naomi, i guess.
yeah.
what was i wearing?
god, i should know. your hair was red. i remember it matched the wallpaper.
egad, were you horrified?
no! i think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
right. something black though.
I will buy that. black's always good.
we did talk about naomi.
i said: are you sure? you seem unsure.
I am sure, i said.
but you weren't. i could tell.
i was so nervous. i remember i could not think of anything to say. there were long silences.
i thought i was foolish. i thought I would mistaken infatuation for love. you said:
so what. infatuation is good, too.
and i did not have an argument.
i dropped you off after. you said --
come up and see me... now.
it is very late.
yes, exactly. exactly my point.
naomi.
on the couch. dark. quiet. i wondered if i had made a terrible mistake. i almost reached for the phone about a thousand times. i thought i could take it back, erase it, explain i had momentarily lost my mind. then i told myself we were not happy. that was the truth. that what we were was safe. it was unfair to you and to me to stay in a relationship for that reason. i thought about clementine and the spark when i was with her, but then i thought what you and i had was real and adult and therefore significant even if it was not much fun. but i wanted fun. i saw other people having fun and i wanted it. then i thought fun is a lie, that no one is really having fun; I am being suckered by advertising and movie bullshit... then i thought maybe not, maybe not. and then i thought, as i always do at this point in my argument, about dying.
yours?
you take it. i do not know.
naomi, i really value our relationship. i hope it is possible for us to stay in touch.
do not do this to me now, joel. really.
i told her today i need to end it.
is that what you want?
i did it. i guess that means something.
so what is going on, joel?
i do not know, I have just been thinking, maybe we are not happy with each other.
what?
y'know, we have been, i do not know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
do not say "we" when you mean "you."
i think maybe, we are both so used to operating at this level that -- how can one person be unhappy? if one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
bullshit. who is it? you met someone.
no. i just need some space, maybe.
the thing is, joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you are just going to be joel with the same fucking problems.
it is not somebody else.
i did not think you would show your face around me again. i figured you were humiliated. you did run away, after all.
sorry to track you down like this. I am not a stalker. but i needed to see you.
yeah?
I would like to... take you out or something.
well, you are married.
not yet. not married.
look, man, I am telling you right off the bat, I am high maintenance. so I am not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. if you want to be with me, you are with me.
okay.
so make your domestic decisions and maybe we will talk again.
joel, I am not a concept. i want you to just keep that in your head. too many guys think I am a concept or i complete them or I am going to make them alive, but I am just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. do not assign me yours.
i remember that speech really well.
i had you pegged, did not i?
you had the whole human race pegged.
probably.
i still thought you were going to save me. even after that.
i know.
it would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
remember me. try your best. maybe we can.
thanks, guys.
i hope you feel better, sweetie.
yeah.
say hi to naomi.
hi.
hi.
how was it?
you did not miss much. rob and carrie say hello.
hi, rob and carrie.
go back to sleep.
yeah. come to bed. I am cold.
in a minute.
so you do not mind?
I have got to finish this chapter anyway.
okay. i wish you could come.
this is it. the night we met. my god, it is over.
say hi to rob and carrie. have some fun!
i hope you get your work done.
yeah.
I am sorry naomi could not make it. you okay? you seem quiet.
just a little overworked, maybe.
i remember you turned around. your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- i could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between naomi and me.
i did. you said, things were fine.
i remember.
this is the night you met clementine, joel. i remember watching you walk down the beach with her and i thought, oh shit.
yeah, you told me that later.
i told you that later.
who was the girl you walked off with?
no one.
your back to me. in that orange sweatshirt i would come to know so well and even hate eventually. at the time i thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
i remember being drawn to you even then. i thought, i love this woman because she is alone down there looking out at the black ocean.
but i went back to my food. the next thing i remember, i felt someone sitting next to me and i saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
hi there.
hi.
you said...
i saw you sitting over here. by yourself. i thought, thank god, someone normal, who does not know how interact at these things either.
yeah. i do not ever know what to say.
i can not tell you how happy i am to hear that. i mean, i do not mean I am happy you are uncomfortable, but, yknow... I am such a loser. every time i come to a party i tell myself I am going to be different and it is always exactly the same and then i hate myself after for being such a clod.
even then i did not believe you entirely. i thought how could you be talking to me if you could not talk to people?
but i thought, i do not know, i thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what i was feeling and that you were attracted to it.
but, i do not know, maybe we are the normal ones, y'know? i mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
and i just liked you so much.
you did? you liked me?
you know what i did.
yeah, i know. I am fishing.
you said --
I am clementine. can i borrow a piece of your chicken?
and you picked it out of my plate before i could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
oh god, how horrid.
I am joel.
no, it was lovely.
hi, joel. so no jokes about my name?
you mean, like...  oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', clementine... ? huckleberry hound? that sort of thing?
yeah, like that.
nope. no jokes. my favorite thing when i was a kid was my huckleberry hound doll. i think your name is magic.
this is it, joel. it is going to be gone soon.
i know.
what do we do?
enjoy it. say good-bye.
so you are still on the zoloft?
next thing i remember we were walking down near the surf.
no, i stopped. i did not want to feel like i was being artificially modulated.
i know what you mean. that is why i stopped.
but my sleeping is really fucked up.
i do not think I have slept in a year.
you should try xanax. i mean, it is a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it is there. like insurance.
yeah?
I will give you a couple. see what you think.
okay.
have you ever read any anna akhmatova?
i love her.
really? me, too! i do not meet people who even know who she is and i work in a book store.
i think she is great.
me too. there is this poem --
did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
i think, before.
seems too coincidental that way.
yeah, maybe.
do you know her poem that starts "seaside gusts of wind,/and a house in which we do not live...
yeah, yeah. it goes "perhaps there is someone in this world to whom i could send all these lines"?
yes! i love that poem. it breaks my heart. I am so excited you know it.  look, houses in which we do not live.
i wish we did. you married?
um, no.
let's move into this neighborhood.
i do sort of live with somebody though.
oh.
male or female?
female.
at least i have not been barking up the wrong tree.
cool.
what are you doing?
it is freezing out here.
clementine.
i could not believe you did that. i was paralyzed with fear.
c'mon, man. the water's fine. nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. this place is closed up. electricity's off.
i hesitated for what seemed like forever.
i could see you wanted to come in, joel.
i knew.
i knew by your nervousness that naomi was not the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
it is dark.
yeah. what is your girlfriend's name?
naomi.
ah-ha! now i can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
i think we should go.
no, it is our house! just tonight --  -- we are david and ruth laskin. which one do you want to be? i prefer to be ruth but I am flexible.  alcohol! you make drinks. I am going find the bedroom and slip into something more ruth. I am ruthless at the moment.
i really should go. i really need to catch my ride.
i did not want to go. i was too nervous. i thought, maybe you were a nut. but you were exciting. you called from upstairs.
so go.
i did. i walked out the door. i felt like i was a scared little kid. i thought you knew that about me. i ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. you said, "so go" with such disdain.
what if you stay this time?
i walked out the door. there is no more memory.
come back and make up a good-bye at least. let's pretend we had one.
bye, joel.
i love you.
so, I have got to drop the van off.
thanks, stan. thanks.
hey.
do you swear you did not know?
i swear.
and you never even suspected? never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
once, maybe.
it was here. at his car. i was coming back from a job and spotted you together. you seemed caught. i waved. you giggled.
how did i look?
happy. happy with a secret.
and after that?
i never saw you together like that again. so i figured i was imagining things.
i really like you, mary. you know that.
do you remember anything else? what i was wearing? was i standing close to him? was i leaning against his car like i owned it? how did he look at me when i giggled? tell me everything.
you were in red. that red sweater with the little flowers, i think. you were leaning against his car.  he looked a little like a kid. kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I would never seen him look like that before. happy. you looked beautiful. you looked in love.
thanks, stan.
thanks.  so... do we talk about this... or what?
i do not know what I am supposed say, mary. i want to do the right thing here.
do you love me? did you love me? something. i listened to my tape. i can not believe I have been sitting right in front of it for a year. it is like listening to someone else's story. i mean, i hear myself talking about having sex with you and i can not even imagine you naked. i can not even say "naked" to you!
i have a family, mary.
you made me have an abortion.
it was a mutual decision.
you made me have you erased! i loved you. i love you! how could you --
i did not make you. you thought it best.  but, look, i take full responsibility.
so... you have not been involved with anyone in all this time?
it is been a pretty lonely couple of years.
I am sorry.
well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I am sorry.
oh, sweetie. it really does cut both ways. we were taking each other for granted and --
i miss you.
miss you, too.  i have been seeing someone for a little while.
oh! great. that is great!
a religion instructor at columbia. a good guy. he is a good guy.
I am sorry. i really should not have --
I am glad you called.
so you think the dissertation will get published?
i do not know. I am not sure there is a big public demand for books on calvinism and misogyny.
so you will call me, right?
yeah.
when?
tomorrow?
tonight. just to test out the phone lines.
yeah.
hi, naomi, it is joel.
hi.
how is it going?
good. i called you at work today. they said you were home sick.
i know. i had to take the day to think.
yeah, i tried you at home. did you get my message?
i just got in.
long day thinking.
that is me.
there you are.  naomi, it is just... I am afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
okay, joel. i suppose you are right.
i had a good time last night. i really did.
so I am going to get some sleep. I am glad you are okay.
we will speak soon.
'night.
what took you so long?
i just walked in.
hmmm. do you miss me?
oddly enough, i do.
ha ha! you said, i do. i guess that means we are married.
i guess so.
tomorrow night... honeymoon on ice.
do not worry. it is really solid this time of year.
i do not know.
i do not know. what if it breaks?
what if?
i think i should go back.
joel, come here. please.
listen, did you want to make love?
make love?
have sex. y'know --
oh, um...
because i just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
that is okay. i --
I am sorry. i just wanted to say that. this seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
hey, joel --
-- and I am just too nervous around you right now.
I am nervous, too.
yeah? i would not have thought that.
well, you obviously do not know me.
I am nervous because i have and enormous crush on you.
yeah?
did you send this? is it a joke?
i probably got the same thing as you.
i mean, i have not even told anyone I have met you. who would even know to do this?
maybe it is true then. it is my voice on the tape.
that is what you have to say? how could it be true? i never even heard of any procedure like this. it is a joke.
it is true.
i know. i spoke to my friend magda.
look, i have to go. i have to think.
joel, we have fucked. we have made love. like a million times. and we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night. is not that lovely?
says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
says you were a bully...
a bully? moi?
that is what it says. you drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
well, sounds like me. sorry, man.  says you were jealous and suspicious.
says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
did i use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
i do not know.
does not sound like me.
says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
says you were constantly calling me a slob.  it is sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. do not you think?
i sort of do. but i only see it as a fantasy version of reality. cleaned up enough to be erotic.
we should have sex. it is old hat for us.
she should not have done this, stan. as mad as she was... as justifiably --
i do not know what you are talking about, howard.
mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
jesus.
hi, it is joel.
hey, lover. whatcha doing?
I am just, y'know, passing the time best i can till i can see you.
god, i can not believe i ever hated you.
you must have been crazy.
guess what I am wearing.
i do not know. panties and --
your dried cum.
jesus.
you are still excited by my irreverence. you have not yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."
i can not stop thinking about you.
yay. meet me after work by the old mill.
what old mill? is that somewhere we --
i just wanted to say that. come by my house.
oh.
hi.
what do you want, stan?
can i... i brought some --
what is this?
nothing.
i know what it is.
then why did you ask me?
i do not know. i just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
they have a right to know. howard is a thief. he steals the truth.  i can not remember my baby! i can not remember my baby. it existed and i can not even remember. do you understand that?
mary, people come to him voluntarily.
i will not allow it. those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. what do you think of that? that is from my quote book.
the office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
remember the alamo! remember the alamo!
mary... please. this is hurting people.
