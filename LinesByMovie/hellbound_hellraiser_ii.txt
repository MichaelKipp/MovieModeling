where am i?
you are in the malahide institute. it is a psychiatric hospital. but, hey, do not feel judged -- it was just the nearest place to bring you. remember? you and your boyfriend...?
steve...
do not worry. he is o.k. we sent him home hours ago. jeez, what a story.
what was it, kid? smack? angel dust? do not tell me acid's back in fashion?
what are you talking about? who are you?
oh, excuse me...
i thought steve had talked to you?
oh, pardon me. i obviously did not convey my hesitation to take his story at face-value. no, you talk to me. but -- do me a favor? -- none of this demons crap.
he talked about demons, huh?
yeah.
what the hell are you asking me for? tag it. move it.
the mattress... the mattress... julia.
easy, easy. whatever happened, whatever you saw, it is not here now.
i saw it... him. but i got away. and i took the box. and i solved it. and they came.
who?
the cenobites.
so... you are kirsty, huh?
you a doctor, too?
sad, huh? she is been here six months. her name's tiffany.
what is the matter with her?
almost complete withdrawal. she has not said a word for nearly two years.
god, that is terrible.
yeah. doctor malahide's got her doing these jig-saws and things, though. says it is helping to bring her out.
i... i had a visitor.
what?
oh, jesus. i can not explain. it's... it's. i do not know how to help! i have to save him and i do not know how to help!
kirsty, I am sorry... do not understand. i...
i know. no-one can. but i have to save him. where is the other doctor? he said he would listen. he promised.
help. no, no-one can help. i just want someone to listen or i will go crazy.
if anyone can help, he can.
yes... yes. you look...
surreal? strange? nightmarish?
no. you look...
it is a beautiful dress...
i know.
no bad dreams.
so you slept o.k.?
well, the sofa is not often used for sleeping on...
oh yeah? on your own a lot, huh?
and you are sure it was a woman?
god, i wish i could say no. this is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.
do not worry about it. your attitude sucks anyway.
hey, so for it. do not let pity stop you. I am down. nail me.
the box. i need the box.
the box? like in your story? like in his house?
what?
the boxes. in the house. i told you.
what do you mean?
the boxes! i told you.
you did not tell me. do you mean malahide's got...
yeah. the things you were talking about.
get out of the way.
are you crazy?
i do not know, kyle. you are the fucking expert. now get out of the way!
why?
because I am going to get my father!
o.k. let's go.
kyle, you do not have...
i know i do not have to. it is just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. o.k.?
she is done it.
she certainly has.
it is coming.
it certainly is.
oh, kirsty; so eager to play, so reluctant to admit it.
perhaps you are teasing us. are you teasing us?
but i did not open it! i didn't!
then why are you here?
I have come for my father!
but it is true, he is his own hell. just as you are in yours.
and what about you?
it is different for us.
we have always been here.
we have no more surprises.
i want to go back!
sorry, friend. no day trips to hell. here you are. here you stay. and forward the only way to go.
oh, right. daddy's died and gone to heaven, eh?
yes!
shit. bull. shit.
see? he is here. you should learn to believe your uncle frank.
no! he should not be here! it should have been a trick!
'fraid not, baby. he belongs here. with me. we are the same. brothers. equal and opposite. pure appetite. pure banality. too much feeling. none at all.
he... he loved me.
do not waste your tears. look at him!
daddy! daddy! i love you! help me!
I am your daddy now, kirsty.
well, well. all my family together again. how very sweet.
julia.
frank.
i knew you would come.
you knew?
yes. you are a girl who remembers her promises.
oh, i do. i do.
oh. no boxes. such a shame.
no more delays, kirsty. no more teasing. time to play.
time to play.
wait!
no more deals, kirsty. it is your flesh we want to experience, not your skill at bargaining.
no deals! just information. information. free of charge. no strings. just information.
go on. but trick us again, child, and your suffering will be legendary even in hell.
what is this? someone else you think escaped us, like frank?
no, no, this one did not escape. you told me you would always been in hell. you were wrong. look at it. look. it is you.
nonsense, i...
it is you! you have not always been as you are. you were human. remember. remember all your confusions. think!
i... remember.
you were all human!
i have to go back. or it will never stop.
what are you talking...
I have got to finish it.
finish what?
I am scared.
no. do not let it. you have come this far.
i knew you would come back.
I am a girl who keeps her promises.
well... g'bye.
it is been hell.
