a shame.  you looked great tonight.
please.
you did!
do you think we did the right thing?
taking a cab instead of hiring a limo?
you know what i mean...
we did no impact evaluation.  the consequences of...
is this a catholic guilt thing...?
who know?  we get lucky, maybe a couple of 'em'll be ours.
we are down to a "couple" now, huh?
you know where they get this fertility stuff?  they extract it from the urine of menopausal italian nuns.
monks bottle their own wine. do not they?
you were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, do not forget that.
do not get kinky here...
okay, meet me out front.  i got to go. josh's picking me up in five. see you tonight.
I will be late.
siri, sandblast that thing. it looks like trump tower.  those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
just like trump tower, then.
the blintzes!  "try the blintzes..."
selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
not just any carbohydrates, mind you. it was like being on the receiving end of some kind of transcendent oral sex.  we should get a strobe on this thing. maybe even a siren.
yeah, and a loudspeaker so you can yell "epidemic! epidemic! you are all going to die!"
you really love flashing that thing, do not you?
hey. I am a short guy. waddaya want?
...as long as they are ready for the opening i do not care, just tell them that.
I am on it.  do not worry.  look, susan...i do not mean to pry, but... i kinda overheard you and peter.
watch your step, siri.  your grant could be on the line here.
i just...well, i had this cousin in delhi.  she was having problems, too. she, ah...
what?
she used a baster.
not a big one.  i mean, it was like a turkey baster.
oh, jesus.
what is this?
oh, right... they been here since noon. i told them you are real busy.
hello.
you the bug lady, right?
you guys have done a nice job.  how bout five dollars?
that is it?
internal hemorrage. 2 our of 5 have it.  no definite signs of tb, but we will quarantine them a week just to make sure.
immigration's going to love you for that.
tell them to send flowers to the usual address.
did they get the sleazebag who owns this place?
triad, chinese mafia. they bring people from yunan. slave labor...  reverend harry wong, a preacher had the flophouse fronting for them. no sign of him.
I am going to pull it out and i want you to pin it down, okay?
what is it?
i have no idea.  are you ready?
it bit you.
no shit.
this wing configuration. I have never...
fuck! it broke the skin...
and they are not fully developed.  this thing's not even an adult.
my god.
what?
that is impossible.  insects don't...
i know.  help me get a sample.
there are thirty five listed in the reverend wong's roster...
shit.
thought it was my week for that.
i needed to think. it was either this or the weather channel.
this thing was the size of my fist, peter!! that is off the charts!
okay. so you lost a great specimen-
do not you get it? it is more than that.
evolution does not work that fast. something pushed that thing to take the leap. we need to find another specimen.
we?
keep going. we will tell you when to stop...
maybe they lied to you.
even if they did... that is all we have, is not it?
metaxonycha godmani.
so?
you sure you did not see one of these?
gross. what is it?
an "ootheca". an eggcase. it probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
no way. i see one of those, I would puke.
honey, just leave it.
no, there's...
look, i showed you my badge...
yeah, and you going to have to show me a lot bigger one you wanna go down there. that is the old maintenance grid, doc. swiss cheese: tunnels, tracks...
the department of public health...
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
fine.  you want me to call your supervisor?
please do.  he is a lonely guy.
he is special.
he can imitate anything, you just watch him.
excuse me, I am talking to you.
no, you talkin' at me.
for chrissakes.  you gonna lay a two- bit bureaucratic, territorial number on me?
you wanna keep up the conversation, you best come back with the proper permits and the right attitude.
you give someone a fucking uniform and... did you hear how he talked to us?
i heard how you talked to him.
oh, so I am the bad guy now?
he was just doing his job.
fine, then I am the bad guy. jesus!
great crowd.
no such thing, baby.
i get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
fuck 'em.  they do not know what they are missing.
right.
oh, no, you were-
i was just late.
ironic, do not you think?  these guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? and here we are...
susan, we are not b-
...you do not even know what you are looking for.
you said that thing was big as your hand.  i do not think I am going to miss...
why take the chance?  just let me go down there with you...
no.
susan, listen to me:  you handled that insect almost as much as siri...
it did not bite me.
i know.  but if it was carrying something...there's a chance you could have been exposed.
hey, you can't...
what is your name?
jeremy...
okay, jeremy...go get dr. chris raymond, will you?
lady...
did you hear me?  get dr. raymond! now!!
you all watch your step.  we got some burrows goin' down seven stories here.  you fall, i do not wanna have to come pick you up.
new york's finest.
there is really people living down here?
mole people. this section was pretty popular, all the way to fulton street...
it is me. can you hear me?
yeah, barely. we have not found anything down here. nothing...
we will be back at the platform in...
20 minutes. if you do not go sight-seeing anymore.
20 minutes.  susan?
funny.  shoulda seen some track bunnies by now.
what?
track bunnies.  rats.  they are usually around.
peter...
yeah...?
there is some weird shit here.
weird shit...?
take a look.
did you see the size of that thing?!
look what you did! you stupid sonofa-
oh, that is going to work.
you got a better way up?
show that to the station manager.  tell him leonard's going to have his bubble-butt he do not have someone down here in ten.
h-how do i get...?
way we came.  take the first tunnel to your right...
go left.  go left again till you hit the fork... then right again. you got that?
i think so. one right, two lefts...
and a right.
right.
any luck?
well...there's an old service elevator half a mile down the tracks.  am not going to be much use, though.  lines are dead.
you said those cables're still live. can not we rewire...?
oh, man, there you go again.
what?
those things bring juice to the new stations.  you just can not rewire that shit...
for chrissakes, what is the problem? you need a memo every time you fart?
all right, motherfucker, that is it.
my god, what the hell are you...?
hurry, the woman needs help!
don't.
listen to me:  we are getting you out.
what are you doing down here?
chuy. he was taken. he is down here somewhere...  oh, please, hurry. i saw what was after her.
no, jesus, no.
toss the flare down!
i only got...
just do it!
you better tell me what the hell's going on here!
hey, hey!! take it easy!!
wait a minute-
fuck you, wait a minute. I am going to-
its muscles are locked.
oh, jesus!!
you feel anything?
yeah, i feel like ripping your fucking eyes out...
leonard, listen.  i need to see if there is any nerve damage before we carry you back.  look, I am trying to help you here...
oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  you and your goddam memo. you needed to prove your point, uh?
I am sorry.  but i do not think letting you bleed to death is the best apology.
a mistake.
"mistake"?  what is that supposed to...?
it does not matter, all right?  it is dead.
how you know that?  shit, it was runnin' around with its buttside gone and a fucking pipe through its heart...
just inner chambers...
but it look like a man. it... i saw it.
no...
so, you are saying this is like those bugs that -- that look like twigs or leaves or...
that is camouflage...
mantids can mimic. we gave the judas that code...
"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man- ..."
this, is our baby peter. yours and mine. are not you proud?
is there a switch?
third rail is dead.  get me up.  there must be a manual override in the booth.
his blood! it is driving them crazy! we have to mask the odor!
how?!
it is no use! they know we are in here!
they do not know anything peter, they just sense. they are hardwired!
right. hardwired to eat anything that is not like them!
rub it on the windows!
what-
just do it!!
what are you putting that crap on me for?
scent glands.  insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
can we get this car there?
someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that will send us left and to the elevator.
but the power...
hell, i might be able to juice the whole area, if i can get to the power box. it is just a couple of cables...
it would take a minute or so.  you will not last that long out there.
peter, you could not even fix our tv!
we will cover ourselves with this. they can mimic us-  we goddam mimic them!
peter-
it worked before...
the scent will not last...
that is why we should do it now.
the lights come up, you pull the switch.
i pull.
you do not do that, we are on the wrong track.  you...
you gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires.  think you can handle it?
depends.  you got a memo?
he is out there. i heard him. how can he be? this things...
manny...
i did not protect him, lady. he trusted me. and i did not protect him... his father...i lost his father to the streets and now, chuy...
we will find him. we will be back and find him.
do not touch it.  and for godsakes, try not to sweat.  they can sense chemical changes...
try not to sweat?
i was just thinking how i could use a pair of pliers... and i remembered where they are...
that is it. that is it. breathe easy.
what is manny doing? i can not see him anymore.
nino, please...
the kid...
the kid's with them!!
what do you-?
go!! just go!!
he did not do it!
what?
manny never threw the coupling switch!! we are goin' the wrong way!!!
which way?
across both tracks!!
we are no leaving you!
no way we can outrun 'em together. move it!
oh, come on, come on!
jump in.
you go first. I will be right below you.
your arm, you can't...
i can.  we can do this...
c'mon...
ah...
talk to me.
peter...
no...
we can do it!
