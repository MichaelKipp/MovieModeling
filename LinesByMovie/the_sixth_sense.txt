mahogany. I would say that cost at least a couple hundred. maybe three.
three? we should hock it. buy a c.d. rack for the bedroom.
do you know how important this is? this is big time.  I am going to read it for you, doctor.
do i really sound like dr. seuss?
wow. they called you their son.
we can keep it in the bathroom.
--my god.
--do i know you?
your eye frames. they do not seem to have any lenses in them.
they are my dad's. the lenses hurt my eyes.
i knew there was a sound explanation.
what was that you were saying before with your soldiers? day pro fun.
...de profundis clamo ad te domine.
all your soldiers speak latin?
no, just one.
what were they hiding from?
oh, lots of things, i suppose. bad people for one. people who wanted to imprison them. hurt them.
nothing bad can happen in a church, right?
i forgot your name.
dr. crowe.
you are a doctor. what kind?
i work with young people who might be sad or upset or just want to talk. i try to help them figure things out.
i got an award once. from the mayor.
congratulations.
thank you. it was a long time ago. I have kind of been retired for a while.  you are my very first client back.
you use needles?
no.
not even little ones that are not supposed to hurt?
no.
that is good.
I am going to see you again, right?
if it is okay with you?
and cole, next time i will not be late for you.
next time i will not be scared of you.
they are right here.
oh.
what are you thinking, momma?
lots of things.
anything bad about me?
we were supposed to draw a picture. anything we wanted... i drew a man. he got hurt in the neck by another man with a screwdriver.
you saw that on t.v., cole?
everybody got upset. they had a meeting. momma started crying.  i do not draw like that anymore.
how do you draw now?
i draw people with smiles, dogs running, and rainbows.  they do not have meetings about rainbows.
i guess they don't.
you want to ask me a question?
see, this is why i lose at poker. yes, i do have a question.
private kinney's wife is really sick -- she has something called a brain anism.
you mean aneurysm.
yeah, private kinney needed to get back safe to take care of her.
where should i look then, cole?
look over there.
i walk this way to school with tommy tammisimo.
he your best buddy?
he hates me.
you hate him?
you ever tell her about how it is with tommy?
i do not tell her a thing.
why?
cause she does not look at me like everybody and i do not want her to. i do not want her to know.
know what?
that I am a freak.
you said the "s" word.
yeah. sorry.
mr. marschal gets real lonely.
what about mrs. marschal?
she died a long time ago.
...so your dad lives in pittsburgh with a lady who works in a toll booth.
what if she has to pee when she is working? you think she just holds it?
i do not know. i was just thinking the same thing.
what did you write?
words.
what kind of words?
upset words.
think about what you want from our time together. what our goal should be?
something i want?
if we could change something in your life, anything at all, what would you like that to be?
are you calling me?
what? you do not see enough of me at the store?
on my way to the flea market in amish country. thought maybe you want to come. show me how to buy at these things.
i trust you... besides, i do not know if I am up for the amish today. you can not curse or spit or anything around them.
that is very sweet. I am okay.
do you think i should stop by on my way back? show you what i got? it is not a problem.
you know that is probably not the best idea. I will just wait to see them in the store.
okay. fine. understood.  I am off then.
do not step in the horse manure.
thanks.
yes, cole?
they used to hang people here.
that is not correct. where did you hear that?
they would pull the people in crying and kissing their families bye... people watching would spit at them.
cole, this was a legal courthouse. laws were passed here. some of the first laws of this country. this building was full of lawyers. lawmakers.
they were the ones who hanged everybody.
i do not like people looking at me like that.
like what?
stop it!
i do not know how else to look--
you are a stuttering stanley!
excuse me?
you talked funny when you went to school here. you talked funny all the way to high school!
what--
you should not laugh at people. it makes them feel bad.
how did you--?
stop looking at me.
stuttering stanley! stuttering stanley!
who!
stuttering stanley!
s-ssstop that!
stuttering stanley! stuttering stanley!
s-ssssstop it!
stuttering--
--shhhhhhut upppp you fffffffreak!
that is not magic.
what?
you just kept the penny in that hand the whole time...
who me?
i did not know you were funny.
i forgot myself.
...he does not get invited places.
it is our pleasure.
the last time was a chuck e. cheese party a year ago. he hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and did not come out.
chuck e. who?
cheese. it is a kid's place.
i work at an insurance place and at penny's, so cole can go to that good school.
j. c. penny's?
good for you.
i wish i could be like my momma though. she always knew what was wrong. knew just what to say.
your father ever tell you bedtime stories?
yes.
once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... he drove around for a long, long time... driving and driving... it was a long trip... he fell asleep...  when he woke up, they were still driving... the long drive went on--
dr. crowe.
yes.
you have not told bedtime stories before?
no.
you have to add some twists and stuff. maybe they run out of gas.
no gas... hey, that is good.
what makes you think that?
your eyes told me.
i do not know how the story ends. i hope it is a happy ending.
me too.
dead people, like in graves and coffins?
no, walking around, like regular people... they can not see each other. some of them do not know they are dead.
they do not know they are dead?
how often do you see them?
all the time. they are everywhere.  you will not tell anyone my secret, right?
...no.
will you stay here till i fall asleep?
did you think the play sucked big time?
what?
tommy tammisimo acted in a cough syrup commercial. he thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. he said the play sucked big time.
i know every child is special in their own way, but tommy sounds like a punk.  i thought the play was excellent. better than cats.
cats?
never mind.
yes?
and the tiny hairs on your arm. are they all standing up?
when they get mad, it gets cold.
them?
it was grandma's. it is not for playing.  what if it broke? you know how sad I would be.
you would cry. cause you miss grandma so much.
that is right. so why do you take it, sweetheart?
sometimes people think they lose things and they did not really lose them. it just gets moved.
did you move the bumble bee pendant?
you did not take it before. you did not take it the time after that. and now, you did not take it again?
do not get mad.
so who moved it?
there is only two of us.  maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer?  is that what happened?
maybe.
can i ask you then?
yes.
what do you want more than anything?
i do not know.
i told you what i want.
i do not know, cole.
why do not you think about it for a while?
i have to.
when?
soon. one week.
I am going to transfer you. i know two psychologists that are exceptional--
do not fail me.
--what?
do not give up. you are the only one who can help me. i know it.
do not cry.
it means i was not what everyone thought i was...  i was a fake.
you were not a paper champion.
someone else can help you. someone else can make you happy.
dr. crowe?
yes.
you believe me, right?
something happened, did not it?
yes, it did.
are you wigging out?
yes, i am.
we are not going to start crying again, are we?
no, we are not.
what happened?
you really look better.
maybe they wake up that morning thinking they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them in... and then all of a sudden, it is all taken away. no one asked them. it is just gone...
you have nice red in your cheeks now.
do you know what 'yo no quiero morir' is?
it is spanish. it means... 'i do not want to die.'  not all the ghosts are scary, are they? like mrs. marschal?
no.
what do those ghosts want when they talk to you? think real careful now, cole...
just help.
yes! i think that is right!... i think they all want that. even the scary ones...
you believe now?
i believe both of you now.  and i think i might know how to make them go away.
you do?
what if they do not want help? what if they are just angry and they want to hurt somebody?
i do not think that is the way it works, cole.
she came a long way to visit me, did not she?
i guess she did.
i wish i were somewhere else.
where will you go, where no one has died?
do not go home, okay?
i definitely won't.
i think we said everything we needed to say.  maybe it is time to say things to someone else? someone close to you?
maybe.
you were great in the play, cole.
really?
and you know what else?
what?
tommy tammisimo sucked big time.
I would give anything to have been there.
I am ready to communicate with you now.
communicate?
tell you my secrets.
you know that accident up there?
yeah.
someone got hurt.
they did?
a lady. she died.
oh my god.
you can see her?
yes.
where is she?
standing next to my window.
cole, you are scaring me.
they scare me too sometimes.
they?
dead people.
dead people?
ghosts.
you see ghosts, cole?
they want me to do things for them.
they talk to you?
what are you thinking, momma?
...i do not know.
you think I am a freak?
i would never think that about you... ever... got it?
got it.
she says she is sorry for taking the bumble bee pendant. she just likes it a lot.
what?
grandma comes to visit me sometimes.
cole, that is very wrong. grandma's gone. you know that.
i know.
she wanted me to tell you--
cole, please stop.
she wanted me to tell you, she saw you dance.
why, malcolm?
what, anna? what did i do? what is made you so sad?
why did you leave me?
i did not leave you.
i just needed to do a couple of things.  and i needed to tell you something.
tell me.
goodnight, malcolm.
goodnight, sweetheart.
