mr. ullman?
yes?
I am jack torrance.
oh, well - come on in jack.
very nice to meet you.
nice to meet you, mr. ullman.
have any trouble finding us?
oh, no problem at all.  i made the trip in three and a half hours.
well, that is very good time, very good.  please sit down a minute.
jack, just make yourself at home. would you like some coffee?
well, if you are going to have some, i would not mind.  thanks.
susie.
yeah.
do you really want to go and live in that hotel for the winter?
sure, danny, it will be lots of fun.
yeah, i guess so.  anyway, there is hardly anybody to play with around here.
yeah, i know.  it always takes a little time to make new friends.
yeah, i guess so.
what about tony?  he is looking forward to the hotel, i bet.
bill, I would like you to meet jack torrance.
how do you do?
bill, how do you do?
pleased to meet you.
pleasure to meet you.
jack is going to take care of the overlook for this winter.  i would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through.
fine.
jack is a schoolteacher.
eh - formerly a school-teacher.
what line of work are you in now?
I am a writer um... teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet.
well this ought to be quite a change for you.
well, I am looking for a change.
let's see, where were we?  yes.  i was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh may 15th to october 30th and then we close down completely until the following may.
do you mind if i ask why you do that?  it seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
oh, it sure would be
only in a very general way.
well...
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  and this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can not get a foothold.
well, that sounds fine to me.
physically, it is not a very demanding job.  the only thing that can get a bit trying up here during the winter is eh... the tremendous sense of isolation.
well, that just happens to be exactly what I am looking for.  I am eh... I am outlining a new writing project, and eh...
five months of peace is just what i want.
that is very good jack, because eh... for some people eh solitude and isolation...
can of itself be a problem.
not for me.
how about your wife and son?  how do you think they will take to it?
they will love it.
great...
been known to give a few people second thoughts about the job.
I am intrigued.
i do not suppose they eh told you anything in denver about the tragedy we had up here during the winter of 1970?
i do not believe they did.
well, my predecessor in this job
the police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
shut in together over long periods of time.
well, that is eh quite a story.
well, obviously some people can be
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
well, you can rest assured mr. ullman, that is not going to happen with me, and eg as far as my wife is concerned, i am sure she will be absolutely fascinated when i tell her about it.  she is a confirmed ghost story and horror film addict.
hi, babe.
hi, hon.  how is it going?
great.  look, I am at the hotel and i still have an awful lot to go through.  i do not think i can get home before nine or ten.
now danny, when you were brushing your teeth, do you remember if you smelled anything funny, or saw any bright flashing lights, or anything at all strange?
no.
do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
yes.
what is the next thing you remember after you were brushing your teeth?
mommy saying, 'wake up, wake up, wake up danny, wake up.'
now danny, can you remember what you were doing just before you started brushing your teeth?
talking to tony.
is tony one of your animals?
no.  it is the little boy that lives in my mouth.
oh,
if you were to open your mouth now, could i see tony?
no.
why not?
because he hides.
where does he go?
to my stomach.
does tony ever tell you to do things?
now I am going to ask you to do me a favor, and stay quietly in bed for the rest of the day.  okay?
do i have to?
yes, I would like you to.
we are just going to go into one of the other rooms for a few minutes and talk - then I will come back and check on you, okay?
okay.
shall we go into the living room?
yes.
please...
thank you.
mrs. torrance, i do not think you have anything to worry about.  I am quite sure there is nothing physically wrong with danny.
oh, yeah.  oh, yeah, he seems absolutely fine now, but you should have seen him.
but eh what was the matter with him?
mrs. torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  they are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
have you been in boulder long, mrs. torrance?
only about three months.  eh we are from vermont.  my husband was teaching school there.
did the appearance of danny's imaginary friend...?
tony.
did tony's first appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here?
no, um let's see i guess danny started talkin to tony about the time we put him into nursery school.
what sort of injury did he have?
ah he dislocated his shoulder.
how did he manage to do that?
well it is just one of those things. you know... purely an accident, um. my husband had oh... been drinking, and he came home about three hours late, so he was not exactly in the greatest mood that night.  and well danny had scattered some of his school papers all over the room... and my husband grabbed his arm, you know, and pulled him away from them. it's...it's just the sort of thing you do a hundred times with a child - you know, in a park or on the streets - but on this particular occasion my husband just... used too much strength and he injured danny's arm.
boy, we must be really high up. the air feels so different.
uh...huh.
dad?
yes?
I am hungry.
well you should have eaten your breakfast.
we will get something as soon as we get to the hotel, okay?
okay, mom.
hey, was not it around here that the donner party got snowbound?
i think that was farther west in the sierras.
what was the donner party?
there were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  they got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  they had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
you mean they ate each other up?
they had to, in order to survive.
jack...
do not worry, mom.  i know all about cannabilism, i saw it on t.v.
what time does the plane leave?
eight thirty.
well, that still gives up plenty of time to go over everything first.
good morning jack.  i hope you have not been waiting too long.
no problem.  in fact we had time to grab a bite to eat.
good.  glad you made it before they shut down the kitchen.  is your family having a look around?
no, my son's discovered the games room.
oh... has your luggage been brought in?
right there.
oh fine.  well in view of all the ground that we to cover today, i suggest we go and have a quick look at your apartment and then get started straight away.
bill, would you have the torrances' things brought in their apartment.
fine.
I would better collect my family first.
oh...
this is our colorado lounge.
oh, it is beautiful.  my god, this place is fantastic, is not it hon?
sure is.
god, I have never seen anything like this before.  are all of these indian designs authentic?
yes, i believe they are based mainly on navajo and apache motifs.
oh well they are really gorgeous. as a matter of fact this is probably the most gorgeous hotel I have ever seen.
even before anybody knew what a jet set was.  we have had four presidents who stayed here, lots of movie stars.
royalty?
all the best people.
this is the staff wing of the hotel. none of the other bedrooms are heated during the winter.
oh!
perfect for a child.
yeah.
yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
well, it is very... homely.
as a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
oh well he sure did a beautiful job. pink and gold are my favorite colors.
oh...well this is our gold ballroom.
oh, I will say.
we can accommodate up to three hundred people here very comfortably.
boy, i bet you we could really have a good party in this room, huh hon?
oh dick, come on over and say hello to mr. and mrs. torrance.
sure.
this is dick halloran, our head chef.
glad to meet you, winifred.
nice to meet you.
the torrances are going to take care of the overlook for us this winter.
oh, that is just great.  how do you folks like our hotel so far?
yeah.
danny, come on over here.
thanks.
thank you, susie.
dick, if you are ready to do it now, i think it would be a good idea if you could show mrs. torrance the kitchen, while i continue on with jack.
it will be a pleasure.  right this way mrs. torrance.
mrs. torrance, your husband introduced you as winifred.  now are you a winnie or a freddie?
I am a wendy.
oh wendy.  that is nice.  that is the prettiest.
god.  this is the kitchen, huh?
yeah, this is it.  how do you like it, danny?  is it big enough for you?
do not let it get you down mrs. torrance - it is big but it still am not nothing but a kitchen... a lot of the stuff you will never have to touch.
i would not know what to do with it if i did.
well one thing for sure, you do not have to worry about food because you folks could eat up here a whole year and never have the same menu twice.
now this is where we keep all of out meat.  you got fifteen rib roasts - thirty ten pound bags of hamburgers.  you got twelve- turkeys, two dozen pork roasts and twenty legs of lamb.  do you like lamb, doc?
no.
you don't?  well what is your favorite food then?
french fries and ketchup.
beg pardon?
doc.  you called danny 'doc' twice just now.
i did?
yeah.  we call him doc sometimes, you know, like in the bugs bunny cartoons.  but how did you know that?
well i guess i probably heard you call him that.
hi.
hi.
how're you getting on?
dick, can we borrow mrs. torrance for a few minutes?  we are on our way through to the basement - i promise we will not keep her very long.
no problem, mr. ullman.  i was just getting to the ice cream.
do you like ice cream, doc?
yeah.
no, we do not mind.
good.
sound good to you, danny?
yeah.
okay.  you behave yourself.
chocolate.
chocolate it shall be.  come on son.
it is amazing how much activity is going on today.
yes, well the guests and some of the staff left yesterday, but the last day is always very hectic - everybody wants to be on their way as early as possible.
by five of the clock tonight, you will never know anybody was ever here.
just like a ghost ship, huh?
yes.
why do not you want to talk about it?
I am not supposed to.
who says you am not supposed to?
tony.
who is tony?
tony's the little boy who lives in my mouth.
is tony the one that tells you things?
yes.
how does he tell you things?
it is like i go to sleep, and he shows me things but when i wake up, i can not remember everything.
does your mum and dad know about tony?
yes.
do they know he tell you things?
i do not know.
now think real hard, doc.  think.
maybe he showed me something.
try to think what it was.
no, I am scared of nothing here. it is just that you know some places are like people, some shine and some don't.  i guess you could say the overlook hotel here has something about it that is like shining.
is there something bad here?
well, you know doc, when something happens it can leave a trace of itself behind... say like is someone burns toast.
well, maybe things that happened... leave other kinds of traces behind.
not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  just like they can see things that have not happened yet. well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... i think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
what about room 237?
room 237?
you are scared of room 237, ain'tcha?
no i ain't.
mr. halloran, what is in room 237?
nothing.  there am not nothing in room 237, but you am not got no business going in there anyway, so stay out!  you understand, stay out!
good morning, hon.  your breakfast is ready.
what time is it?
it is about eleven thirty.
eleven thirty - jesus!
i guess we have been staying up too late.
i know it.
i made 'em just the way you like 'em, sunny side up.
hmm, nice.
it is really pretty outside.  how about taking me for a walk after you have finished your breakfast?
oh i suppose i oughta try to do some writing first.
any ideas yet?
lots of ideas.  no good ones.
well, something'll come.  it is just a matter of settling back into the habit of writing every day.
yeah... that is all it is.
it is really nice up here, is not it?
i love it.  i really do.  I have never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
yeah.  it is amazing how fast you get used to such a big place.  i tell you, when we first came up here, i thought it was kinda scarey.
the loser has to keep american clean, how is that?
all right.
and you are going to lose.  and I am going to get you - you betta run fast! look out - I am coming in close. all right?
okay danny, you win.  let's take the rest of this walking, huh?
okay...oh!
give me your hand.  oh, is not it beautiful.
yeah.
oh what a maze.  is not it beautiful.
yeah.
it is so pretty.
yeah.
i did not think it was going to be this big, did you?
no.
what do you want me to do about it?
ah, come on hon.  do not be so grouchy.
I am not being grouchy.  i just want to finish my work.
okay.  i understand.  I will come back later on with a couple of sandwiches for you and... maybe you will let me read something then.
wendy,  let me explain something to you. whenever you come in here and interrupt me, you are breaking my concentration.
and it will then take me time to get back to where i was, understand?
yes.
fine.  now we are going to make a new rule.  whenever i am in here and you hear me typing,
or whether you do not hear me typing, whatever the fuck you hear me doing in here, when i am in here that means that i am working - that means do not come in.  now do you think you can handle that?
yes.
fine.  why do not you start right now and get the fuck out of here, hmm?
oh i would not think of it.
well how can i repay you?
it is okay, really.
well I am going to have some coffee. would you like some?
sure.
great.  sit down.  oh these marvellous doughnuts, help yourself. coffee will be ready in a few minutes.
mom?
yes?
can i go to my room and get my fire-engine?
not right now, daddy's asleep.
i will not make any noise.
come on, doc.  he only went to bed a few hours ago.  can not you wait till later?
i will not make a sound, i promise. I will tip-toe.
well all right.  but really do not make a sound.
i won't, mom.
make sure you come right back, 'cause I am going to make lunch soon. okay?
okay, mom.
can i go to my room and get my fire-engine?
come here for a minute, first.
how is it going, doc?
okay.
are you having a good time?
yes, dad.
good.  i want you to have a good time.
i am, dad.  dad?
yes.
do you feel bad?
no.  I am just a little tired.
then why do not you go to sleep?
i can't.  i have too much to do.
dad?
yes?
do you like this hotel?
yes i do.  i love it.  do not you?
i guess so.
good.  i want you to like it here. i wish we could stay here for ever, and ever... ever.
dad?
what?
you would not ever hurt mummy and me, would you?
what do you mean?
did your mother ever say that to you - that i would hurt you?
no, dad.
are you sure?
yes, dad.
i love you, danny.  i love you more than anything else in the whole world, and I would never do anything to hurt you, never... you know that, do not you, huh?
yes, dad.
good.
i had... i had the most terrible nightmare i ever had.  it is the most horrible dream i ever had.
it is okay.  it is okay, now.  really.
i dreamed that i... that i killed you and danny.
what will it be?
now I am awfully glad you asked me that, lloyd, because i just happen to have two twenties and two tens right here in my wallet.  i was afraid they were going to be there until next april.  so here's what: you slip me a bottle of bourbon, a glass and some ice.  you can do that, can not you, lloyd?  you are not to busy, are you?
how is my credit in this joint anyway?
your credit's fine, mr. torrance.
that is swell.  i like you, lloyd. i always liked you.  you were always the best of them.
best goddamned bartender from timbuctoo to portland maine - portland oregon for that matter.
thank you for saying so.
how are things going, mr. torrance?
things could be better, lloyd. things could be a whole lot better.
i hope it is nothing serious.
nothing that i can not handle though, lloyd.  thanks.
women!  can not live with 'em.  can not live without 'em!
no.  it is the truth, really.  i swear it.  danny told me.  he went up into one of the bedrooms, the door was open, and he saw this crazy woman in the bath-tub.  she tried to strangle him.
which room was it?
did you find anything?
no, nothing at all.
you went into the room danny said - to 237?
yes, i did.
and you did not see anything at all?
absolutely nothing.  how is he?
he is still asleep.
good.
somebody did that to him.
i think he did it to himself.
get him out of here?
yes.
you mean just leave the hotel?
yes.
shovellings out driveways, work in a car wash - any of that appeal to you?
jack...
wendy, i have let you fuck up my life so far, but I am not going to let you fuck this up!
good evening.  forest service.
hallo.  my name's dick halloran. I am the head chef up at the overlook hotel.
good evening, mr. halloran.  what can i do for you?
sir, I have been trying to make an urgent phone call up there,
I would be glad to do that, sir.  oh why do not you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?
thank you very much.  I will do that.
all right, sir.
hi lloyd.  I have been away.  now I am back.
good evening mr. torrance.
it is good to see you.
it is good to be back, lloyd.
what will it be, sir?
no charge?
your money's no good here.
I am the kind of man likes to know who is buying their drinks, lloyd.
it is not a matter that concerns you, mr. torrance - at least not at this point.
I am afraid it is advocaat sir.  it tends to stain.
advocaat is it?
yes sir.  look um... i think the best thing is to come along to the gentlemen's room, sir, and eh...
that does not matter, sir.  you are the important one.
awfully nice of you to say.  of course i intend to change my jacket this evening before the fish and goose soiree.
will not keep you a moment, sir.
fine.
grady?
yes, sir.
delbert grady.
that is right, sir.
have not i seen you somewhere before?
why no, sir.  i do not believe so.
ah ha, it is coming off now, sir.
eh... mr. grady... were not you once the caretaker here?
why no, sir.  i do not believe so.
yes, sir.  i have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
and, er... where are they now?
oh, they are somewhere around.  I am not quite sure at the moment, sir.
no.
he is, mr. torrance.
who?
a nigger.
a nigger!
a nigger cook.
how?
your son has a very great talent. i do not think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
well, he is a very willful boy.
she eh... interferes.
perhaps they need a good talking to, if you do not mind my saying so. perhaps a bit more.
if jack will not come with us, we will just have to tell him that we are going by ourselves.  that is all there is to it.
red rum.  red rum.
danny?
red rum.  red rum.  red rum.
red rum.
danny... what is the matter, hon?
red rum.
are you having a bad dream?
good evening.  forest service.
hallo, this is dick halloran again. i called a while ago about the folks at the overlook hotel.
jack!
how do you like it?
i...
i can not really remember.
you can not remember.
i do not know.
i do not think that is true.  i think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with danny... and I would like to know what they are.
well i... i think maybe he should be taken to a doctor.
you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
yes...
when do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
as soon as possible.
jack...
of course i am.
of course you are.
have you ever thought about my responsibilities?
oh jack, what are you talking about?
have you ever had a single moment's thought about my responsibilities? have you ever thought for a single solitary moment about my responsibilities to my employers?
stay away from me!
why?
i just want to go back to my room.
why?
do not hurt me!  do not hurt me!
I am not going to hurt you.
stay away from me,
wendy!
stay away...!
darling, light of my life, I am not going to hurt you.  you did not let me finish my sentence.  i said 'i'm not going to hurt you... I am just going to bash your brains in!'  I am going to bash them right the fuck in.
stay away from me!
I am not going to hurt you.
stay away from me!
stay away from me!  please...
stop swinging the bat.
stay away from me.
put the bat down, wendy.
stop it!
wendy give me the bat.
stay... stay away!
give me the bat.
stay away from me.
give me the bat.
jack, stay away from me!
stop swinging the bat.
get down.
give me the bat.
go away from me.
wendy...
go away.
give me the bat.
go away.
give me the bat.
I will bring back a doctor.
wendy...
I am going to go now.
wendy...
it is grady, mr. torrance.  delbert grady.
grady... oh.
no need to rub it in, mr. grady. I will deal with that situation as soon as i get out of here.
will you indeed, mr. torrance.
just give me one more chance to prove it, mr. grady.  that is all i ask.
your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, mr. torrance. somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
for the moment, mr. grady.  only for the moment.
i fear that you will have to deal with this matter in the harshest possible way, mr. torrance.  i fear that is the only thing to do.
there is nothing i look forward to with the greater pleasure, mr. grady.
you give your word on that do you, mr. torrance?
danny.  danny, stop it.  danny!
red rum.  red rum.  red rum.  red rum.
mommy...
danny, come here!
mommy... mommy...!
danny!
mommy!
oh!
