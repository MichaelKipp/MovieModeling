mrs. langtry, I am sorry.
why? what is wrong?
you are a valued customer, as you know.
but what is wrong?
i can not understand a thing like this. it is something you almost never see.
what is?
this is some of the finest filigreed platinum I have ever seen. but the stones, no. they are not diamonds, mrs. langtry.
but they must be! they cut glass!
glass will cut glass, mrs. langtry. do you know where it was purchased?
it was a gift. it is not worth anything at all?
why, of course it is. i can offer you -- well, five hundred dollars.
all right.
I will get you a check.
i hope you are not too badly disappointed with us, mrs. langtry.
it is not your fault.
you will give us an opportunity to serve you again, i hope. if there is anything you think we might be interested in...
i have only one thing now. are you interested?
well, I would have to see it, of course.
you are seeing it. you are looking right at it.
mr. simms.
why yes, mr. dillon. here's a potential new neighbor, looking at--
uh-huh. mrs. langtry may drop by.
well, well. in a real hurry, are we?
always, for you, baby.
you are not taking me for granted, are you?
taking you for granite?
that is not granite. if that fell on me, it would not hurt at all.
are you sure?
let's find out.
bobo wants you to go on to delmar.
delmar? i never go out to california. that is a thousand miles from here.
nine hundred. bobo needs somebody to handle playback this time. come on, lilly, you do not argue with bobo.
i know.
take two, three days. call when you get there.
maybe I will swing around los ang gleez on the way.
roy?
mm?
look at me.
oh, i am, baby, believe me.
roy? it this all we have?
all? it am not bad.
no more than this?
what are you talking abut, myra? marriage?
i did not say that. you are not marriage material.
ow! hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?
no, baby. come to mama.
i did not teach you that.
you taught me a lot. then i invented.
let me see how you did that one.
scram. go home.
i can't. i just left home.
you are too young. you should be in school.
i am in school.
where is the five?
in your other hand.
the ambulance is on the way, for what good it will do.
what? he is going to be all right!
mrs. dillon, your son was in some sort of accident. he is had an internal hemorrhage, he is bleeding to death inside.
well, make it stop!
his blood pressure is under a hundred. i do not think he will live to get to the hospital.
you know who i work for.
yes, yes, but that is --
my son will be all right. if he isn't, I will have you killed.
your kid's in the back here. he is crying.
roy? he is always crying.
the kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
i like you, too.
so what is your story today?
they twisted my arm.
only one arm?
they knocked out my tooth!
only one tooth?
come on, kid, let's see if there is any food in the house.
hah.
sure i am. what made you turn up, after all these years?
I am working down in san diego. just for a few weeks.  thought I would drop in on my long-lost son.
nice to see you.  what am i doing in here?
you were bleeding inside, honey. remember that bruise you had?
you called the doctor, huh?
well, no, roy. your mother found you.
oh, yeah?  thanks.  how long do they say I am in here?
well... you are all right now, i guess. i have to get down to the track.
thanks, uh, lilly.
do not mention it.
i guess i owe you my life.
you always did.
her job.
i want to know everything about you.
you do. and once I am out of here, I will remind you of the best parts.
you heard the shower, did not you?
i do not care about that. this time, i got to have the rent.
joe, i thought i was gonna be all right by now, i just need a little more --
it is not the owner, myra, it is my wife. she knows what is going on. this time, i got to have the money.
joe, you know you will --
joe, could we talk it over? do you want a drink?
my wife sent me here, myra. for the money. she is waiting.
I will have it tonight. nine o'clock? ten?
this time...
we will work something out, joe.
i do not see why you are still here. you look healthy to me.
i just do what the doctor says, babe.
you are just comfortable, that is all. you do not even ask to go home. you just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
mama!
who else is paying for all this? you badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
I will pay lilly back, do not you worry about that.
i do not like to come here, roy. every time i do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
that is just lilly's way.
and you never defend me. you are afraid of her.
oh, do not be stupid.
you are a mama's boy, if you want the truth.
get well soon.
every day in every way.
I will see you when you get home.
what happened to your hand?
just a little accident. i went by your place, picked up your mall. just bills, I will take care of them.
i can take care of my own bills, lilly.
whatever you say. the manager says your boss called.  really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
what are you talking about? so I have got a job. so what?
stop kidding me! four years in a town like los ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? you expect me to believe that?
it is there. the boss called, you said so yourself.
and that dump you live in! those clown pictures on the walls!
i like those.
you do not! roy dillon? cornball clown pictures? commission salesman? it is all a front, is not it? you are on the grift, i know you are. you are working some angle, and do not tell me you are not because i wrote the book!
you are one to talk. still running playback money for the mob.
that is me. that is who i am. you were never cut out for the rackets, roy, and if you --
how come?
not as tough as you, huh?
no. and you have to be.
up to you.
my boss is a guy named bobo justus, back in baltimore. when a long shot gets too much action, i have to put money on that horse at the track, because it is the only way to get the odds down.
sure.
the first day of the delmar meet, there was a nag called bluebell. i should have been on it. but that was the day after you came in here, so i stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
that was my choice, nothing to do with you. i took a chance, and it did not work out.
bluebell came in?
i sent bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets. i hoped that would cover me.  it didn't.
hi, bobo.
did i buy you that dress, you piece of shit?
well, i guess so. you are the guy i work for.
you work for me, huh? then i just may flush you down the toilet. drive me to the durando.
how did you figure you were going to get away with that?
I am not getting away with anything, bobo.
you are fuckin right you are not. how much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?
i was down on that horse, bobo. not as much as i should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--
one question. do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?
i want to keep my teeth.
now I will ask you another. you think i got no contacts out here? that nag paid off at just the opening price. there was not hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. there am not enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! you send me ten thousand dollars, like I am some mark you can blow off!
bobo, no, i --
you wanna talk to me straight up?
my son --
your what?
my son was in the hospital --
what the fuck are you doin with a son?
he left home a long time ago. he was in the hospital, up in los ang gleez, real sick.
motherhood.
i never fucked up before, bobo.
you expect me to buy this?
i got a lot of people work for me, lilly. i can not have shit like this.
it will never happen again. i swear.
it happened once. with me, that is making a habit of it.
you are calling the shots.
you got any kind of long coat in the car? anything you can wear home over your clothes?
no.
I will loan you a raincoat.
you ever hear about the oranges?
you mean, the insurance frammis?
tell me about the oranges, lilly.
you hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they do not really get hurt, not if you do it right. it is for working scams against insurance companies.
and if you do it wrong?
it can louse up your insides. you can get puh, puh, puh...
what is that, lilly?
permanent damage.
you will never shit right again.
almost forgot. that ten grand of yours. it is in the envelope by the door.
oh, thanks, bobo.
you want a drink?
gee, i better not, if it is okay. i still got to drive back up to los ang-gleez.
see your son, huh? well, that is nice. a side of you i did not know, lilly.
he is a good kid. a salesman.
on the square, huh? and how are you making out these days? stealing much?
not skimming a thing, lilly?
oh, well, you know. i just clip a buck here and a buck there. not enough to notice.
that is right. take a little, leave a little.
a person that do not look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. he is a liability, right, bobo?
you are a thousand percent right!
or else he is working an angle. if he does not steal a little, he is steeling big.
you know it, lilly.
you know, i like that suit, bobo. i do not know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
yeah? you really think so? a lot of people been telling me the same thing.
well, you can tell them i said they are right.  i better get going. roy'll wonder where i am.
worries about his mother, eh? give him a hug for me.
i will. so long, bobo.
lucky? you call that lucky?
he let me live. he let me be his friend.
you do not put up with that! nobody has to put up with that!
you do if you are where i am. where you want to be. how did you get that punch in the stomach, roy?
i tripped over a chair.
get off the grift, roy.
why?
you do not have the stomach for it.
i just give you your life. what you do with it is up to you.
that is right.
well, thank you. and thank them.
sickness comes to us all, mister dillon.
that is true, mr. simms.
we never know when and we never know why. we never know how. the only blessed thing we know is, it will be at the most inconvenient and unexpected time. just when you have got tickets to the world series. and that is the way the permanent waves.
well, I am back now. i just wanted you to know. got to rush.
happy to see you looking so good.
whadaya say?
hello.
kaggs. home office.
roy dillon.
i know that. knew it when i saw you out there. the best salesman here, which is not saying much. want to talk to you, dillon.
what is up?
that was a pretty backhanded compliment. if i let people get away with things like that, i would not be a good salesman.
you are right. i apologize. but i still want to talk to you.
lead on.
when i said you being the best salesman here did not say much, i meant for us. i know your record with sarber and webb, and I would say you are a top-flight man, but you have had no incentive. no one walking on your heels. just a lot of half asses, so the tendency's been not to stretch yourself. I am bouncing the slobs, incidentally.
so i heard.
makes no difference to me if they are only on commission. if they do not make good money, they are not giving us good representation, and we can not afford to have them around. ever supervise salesmen?
just myself.
that is right, you have had to supervise yourself. this place needs a sales manager. somebody who is proved he is a salesman and can handle other salesmen. he would have a lot of deadwood to clear out, new men to hire. what do you think?
sounds like a good idea.
i do not know offhand what your best year's been, we can look it up. the idea is, we will top it by fifteen percent.
what? me?
that is just the first year. if you are not worth a lot more than that the second year, I will kick you out. what do you say?
well, uh... no.
no?
i can not take that job! i mean, i mean, i can not take it right away. I am still recuperating, i just dropped in to say hello, see everybody --
i did not realize. yeah, you do look a little pale. how soon will you be ready? a week?
but you need a man right now. it would not be fair to you to --
i take care of the being-fair-to-me department. things've gone to hell this long, they can go a little longer.
well...
see you in a week, roy. i can call you roy?
oh, sure. fine.
and I am perk. short for percy, I am afraid.
perk.
i do not see why we have to take the train.
because it is comfortable.
what if we want to drive somewhere while we are there?
we will rent a car.
big spender.
you am not seen nothin.
no.
see you soon.
you were right, i had to get out of that hospital. nothing wrong with me any more.
I will sign that affidavit.
great to get away, take it easy. next week, I will get back to work.
you already went back to work.
what?
i watched you. working the tap on those soldier boys.
working the what?
oh, come on, roy.
the tap. what you do for a living.
I am a salesman.
you are on the grift. same as me.
myra, I am not following this.
roy, you are a short-con operator. and a good one, i think. do not talk to me like I am another square.
you talk the lingo. what is your pitch?
the long end. big con.
nobody does that single-o.
i was teamed ten years with the best in the business. cole langley.
I have heard the name.
it was beautiful. and getting better all the time.
is that right?
it is, roy! and now, right now, it is the perfect time, the best time since I have been in the game.
mary beth, what we have here, uh...
oh, i told mister hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
mary beth, i hope you are not spreading this good news too widely.
well, of course not! i know how dangerous this is. but i would trust mister hebbing with anything.  would not i, darling?
well, I will have to take your word for it, mary beth. here's your money.
goody!
henry, next time, could not mister hebbing --
mary beth! this has never been anything but --
oh, i know, i know, and you have been wonderful since i was widowed. but mister hebbing has--  -- you do not mind my telling him, darling --  -- suffered reverses. if he could...
well. if mary beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...
so here we are!
mister hebbing, we are talking about breaking the law here, i want to be sure you understand that. no one gets hurt, but the law does get broken.
well, that is what the law's for, is not it?
and i do not just mean the sec. we could have the fbi breathing down our necks.
i certainly hope not.
loose talk is the one thing i worry about.
i can keep my mouth shut, mister fellowes.
the tokyo exchange is nine hours ahead of us, new york one hour behind. there is not one hour of the day when both are open. information moves, but it has to wait. now, we have a young fellow working here -- do you know what a hacker is, mister hebbing?
one of those computer geniuses, is not it?
you are right! and this boy tapped into that main link between tokyo and the new york stock exchange. he can give us, when it is really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. do you know what that means?
well, you have got your information ahead of new york, i see that.
every once in a while, a major change comes through. we have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in new york before the tokyo data comes in.
not much time.
we have to be ready. we have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.
seven seconds. i do not see how you do it.
these machines -- they are in here.
want a look?
oh, henry, no, that is just boring.
come take a look. an entire-suite of main-frame computer.
we are not really interested, henry.
he did not think they were risks. he was so good, roy, he could just play with the mark.
and when he got serious?
he would explain he had to have cash, so there would not be any paper trail for the sec. and a lot of cash, or it was not worth while. the least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! from one sucker!
i thought these people were broke.
no, no, roy, just cash poor. they had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. sell their wife's jewelry. oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. or when i put their minds to it. i stayed with them, that is the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to cole.
and a month later, the sucker calls the cops and you are on the run.
no no! he never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
yeah? how?
here you are! two rich people!
i must admit, mister fellowes, i had moments i was worried.
you brought a case? good.
you ruined me! you destroyed me!
henry, no!
oh, roy, it was great! we were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
what happened to cole?
he retired.
where?
upstate.
upstate where?
atascadero.
that is where they keep the criminally insane, is not it?
cole, it will be all right. honey?
can not move.
it is just the strain again, the stress. we will take a vacation.
it is all hollow. nothing behind it.
demon! demon! that is why you can walk on it! demon!
oh, cole, please. please come out of it. what would i do without you?
i just bet you are, too. and now you are trying to rope me.
join up with you! i watched you, roy, I have been watching you, wondering if i should talk about this at all, or maybe just...
take a hike, you mean?
i need a partner, roy. i need an inside man, and you are it. you could be as wonderful as cole.
i do not know, myra, i never had partners. i never needed them.
not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. but how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?
think about it. okay?
sure.
i still do not see why we have to have separate rooms. you expect your father to come through?
separate bathrooms, darling. i will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
things a man is not supposed to know.
you do not mind, really, do you, roy? it is been such a wonderful evening, i guess i just wore myself out.
sure. I am pretty tired myself.
yeah?
open your door.
what?  what for?
open it and find out.
you -- i do not know.
) if you could have seen your face when i told you good night! you looked so, so... ah!
oh, come here.
roy! what are you doing in san diego?
myra and me come down to lajolla for the weekend.
if you come out to the track, do not know me.
we will not hit the track. the beach. couple a nice restaurants.
what is that?
four grand. for the hospital. is that enough?
roy, i do not want money from you.
i pay my debts.
you do?
expecting visitors?
no. that was the point.
you ought to put a bandage on that.
no can do. have to dip in and out of my bag too much. besides, it will heal in the air.
i thought... i was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
i guess not. you will be heading east from here, huh?
after the meet. back to baltimore.
well... nice to see you again, lilly.
you, too, roy.
you were gone for a while.
i went out to delmar.
) the track? did you run into lilly?
i saw her.
she did not see you, in other words.
I am not trying to make trouble, roy. it is just, she is always so nasty to me, i thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. i saw her out there, and i called a friend of mine in baltimore, so now i know who she is.
you must have some very knowledgeable friends.
I am well connected, roy, cole introduced me to a lot of people. very valuable. valuable for us.
running your broker scam, you mean.
you and me, roy. what a team we will make. we think alike; we get along together. once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. you will not regret this, roy.
regret what? i did not say i was coming aboard.
but why not? i thought it was settled. what is holding you back?
come on, myra, do not talk business here. this is time out.
you mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. easier on home grounds.
yes or no. they are both easier at home. okay?
good to have you back, roy. i was just looking at --
mr. kaggs, I am sorry.
you are turning me down? makes no sense, roy.
i guess I am just not a leader of men.
oh, come on, roy.
the truth is, mr. kaggs --
perk, remember?
okay, fine. perk, the truth is, i like things the way they are now. pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
a well-rounded life. i respect that. but it has to have a center, roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
maybe I am just not ready for that yet.
well, roy, if that is the way you feel, i will not badger you.  do not want to lose you as a salesman, too.
oh, I would like to stay on. just keep everything the way it was.
that is what we will do, then. but i tell you what, roy. before i hire anybody else, I will ask you one last time. fair enough?
fair enough.
and hello to you, too.
i called a fellow i know in tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. there is a sucker there he says is made for us. and a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! now, i can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. that leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. we could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
wait a minute! when did this happen, that we are partners?
what?
the last i looked, we were just talking things over.
but the setup's there. it is there now.
i do not think i need it.
you are too good for the small-time, roy. move up to where there is big dough to be made, and you do not have to stick your neck out every day.
maybe i like it where i am.
do not i get any say in this?
no! because i --
that is what i say.
what?
what i say is, no. we do not do partners.
for christ's sake, why not?
mostly, because you scare the shit out of me. I have seen people like you before, baby. double-tough and sharp as they come, and you get what you want or else. but you do not make it work forever.
bullshit!
no; history. sooner or later, the lightning hits. i do not want to be around when it hits you.
what is it? what is going on?
I am happy the way i am.
by god, it is your mother. it is lilly.
) what?
sure it is. that is why you act so funny around each other.
what is that?
do not act so goddamned innocent! you and your own mother, gah! you like to go back where you been, huh?
you watch that mouth.
I am wise to you, i should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. how is it, huh? how do you like --
well, sure, roy. you want me to drive up --? okay, fine, come on down.  it will not be a home-cooked meal, you know.
well, that is good news.
evening. welcome to phoenix.
good evening. I would like a single for tonight.
oh, everything's the same size, same price.
I am a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
those trucks. i know exactly what you mean.
do you have something around back, facing away from the road?
I will put you in one thirty-one. very quiet. faces the desert.
sounds perfect. i can park my car back there?
right in front of the room.
fine.
and I will want to leave an early wake-up call.
no problem. my husband gets up the crack of dawn.  it is his kidneys.
roy dillon?
yes?
lieutenant pierson, phoenix police. i have a car here.
thank you.
i realize this is a shock.
well, mostly, i do not believe it.
that is natural.
no. i mean, i do not believe it. lilly is not a suicide. i know my mother, nothing would make her check out.
I am sorry, it was her all right. her gun, even.
gun?
i grant you, it is a little odd, shoot yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right. it really is your mother, mister dillon.
it may be lilly, but it is not suicide.
do you have any particular reason to say that?
my mother... well, i guess it does not matter now. she worked for gamblers. she always knew they might turn on her some day.
a hit, you mean. honestly, it does not have that feel to it, but I will certainly consider the possibility. thank you for telling me.
not that it matters.  this is the morgue?
you up to it now?
sure. let's get it over.
one thing i have to caution you about. a gunshot wound...
yes, i know, i know.
well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.
what?
I am sorry, that is an unfortunate phrase, it slipped out, i'm, to tell you the truth, mr. dillon, this is not an everyday occurrence around here.
ate the gun. oh.
someone who knows her well could still identify her, that is not the problem. it is just there's, uh, it is likely to be a shock.
well, let's get the shock over with.
not many laughs in this room, eh?
not many.
oh, jesus.
no question, huh?
no, its -- why did she--?
that is that, then.
oh, yeah. that is that.
going somewhere?
somewhere else, that is for sure.
i just came back from phoenix.
oh, yeah? is the frame holding?
looks very solid, lilly. sit down. take a minute, tell me about it.
I have really got to --
you are dead, lilly, it worked.
not for long. not when they do a fingerprint check.
why should they? the cops are satisfied.
bobo will not be. he will spend the money to make sure.
even so. you still got time. relax a minute, tell me what happened. sit down.
myra followed you, huh?
she must have been the one that blew me off with bobo. i guess to get me running. did you tell her about my stash?
no.
no, you wouldn't. that is what she was after, though. but why hit on me?
i would not go in on a deal with her. she blamed you for it.
as though you do what i say.
that is pretty funny, all right. what happened in phoenix?
i sat in there with her, i thought, what do i do now? run and I have got bobo and the law after me. stay, and how do i explain?
this way's perfect.
it is, is not it? and maybe it is a break for me after all. I have been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I am out. i can make a clean start, and --
you have already made a start. does not look that clean, though.
I am sorry. i hated to take your money, but --
do not be sorry. you are not taking it.
i need this, roy. i can not run without money, and if i can not run I am dead.
you must have some money.
just a few bucks.
and myra's stuff?
her credit cards. how far am i gonna get with that?
far enough. maybe up to san francisco. or st. louis, someplace new. start over.
at what?
you are smart, lilly, and you are good-looking. you will not have any trouble finding a job.
a job? I have never had a legit job in my life!
well, you are going to start, if you hope to live through this. a square job and a quiet life. you start showing up at the track or the hot spots and bobo's boys will be all over you.
roy, i know what to do with myself! it is a big world out there.
not any more. lilly, listen, I am giving you good advice. I am following it myself.
what?
i thought it over, and you were right. you wanted me out of the rackets, and now --
roy, that is fine, but i do not have time for this. bobo --
i thought you would be happy for me. after all, you --
bobo is not after you! bobo's after me, and he is goddamn good! but so am i. I am a survivor, roy. i survive.
i know you do, so that is why --
and to survive, my way, i need money. bobo knows about the stash in the car, so i did not dare touch it, not if lilly dillon's dead. so that leaves this.
no.
you want a drink?
i do not think so. you probably should not either.
no, but I am goddamn thirsty. ice water?
yeah, sure, that sounds nice.
I will get it.
you do not know what I would do, roy. you have no idea. to live.
oh, you will live, lilly.
i know what is bugging you, of course.
oh? i did not know anything was.
oh, really? you have got a legitimate complaint, roy, i do not deny that. i was not a very good mother when you were a kid.
not very good!
a bad mother. by any standards. I have thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. i know just how bad i was.
uh-huh.
i wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
never.
no, i guess not. it was pretty lousy of me, i guess, to be a child at the same time you were. not to stop being a child just because i had a child. i guess i was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up.
what do you want me to do? pin a halo on you? you are doing a pretty good job of that yourself.
and making you feel bad at the same time, huh? but that is the way i am, you know, the way I have always been. always picking on poor little roy.
for god's sake, lilly!
i gave you your life twice. I am asking you to give me mine once. i need the money.
no.
you are getting off the grift?
that is right.
that is good. you do not really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
i don't?
if you stayed a crook, do you think you would live to be my ripe age?
i do not see why not.
well, i guess i got it wrong, then. seems to me i heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him.
well, uh...
sure, sure, that does not count. that is different.
well, it does not matter, does it? I am getting out.
and that is why you have got to get rid of this money. if you keep it around, it will just make you think how clever you are. it will be a temptation to get back into the game.
oh, that is it! you are stealing my money for my own good! how very motherly of you, lilly.
if i should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. that is why you have got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. if you try to do it your way, what future is in it?
a future. the only future I have got.
that money would not last forever. and then what? you would be back in some other part of the rackets. another bobo justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. this way, you have got to go the square route. you could send me a card when you are settled, i could maybe help out sometimes...
) that is what it is, is not it? keep me down. your turn to be in charge, have the power.
just trying to help, lilly.
roy... what if i told you i was not really your mother? that we were not related?
what?
there is nothing more to talk about.
i have to have that money, roy. what do i have to do to get it?
lilly, jesus, what are you doing?
is there nothing i can do, roy, nothing at --
no!
