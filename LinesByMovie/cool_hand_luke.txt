a bunch. must be halfa dozen newmeat.
no more than five. for a cold drink.
bet! babalugats, bet here!
here, captain.
maliciously destroyin' municipal property while under the influence. what was that?
cuttin' the heads off parkin' meters, captain.
well, we am not never had one of them. where did you think that was going to get you?
i guess you could say i was not thinkin', captain.
says here you done real good in the war: silver star, bronze star, couple purple hearts. sergeant! little time in stockades. come out the same way you went in: buck private.
that is right, captain. just passin' the time.
well, you got yourself some time now. two years. hell, that am not much, we got coupla men here doin' twenty spots. we got one who is got all of it. we got all kinds and you going to fit in real good. course in case you git rabbit in your blood and decide to take off fer home, you git a bonus a some time and couple leg chains to keep you slowed down a little -- fer your own good. you will learn the rules. it is all up to you. i can be a good guy or i can be one mean son-of-a-bitch, it is up to you.
you do not take another man's place, boy.
it was not his fault. nobody said anything about seats. we --
you got to mind your manners, you actin' like a hillbilly tramp.
tramp! beautiful!
in the navy, we used to call guys --
fasten your flap! all you newmeats going to have to shape up fast and hard on this gang. we got rules here an' in order to learn them, you got to keep your ears open and your mouths shut.
somebody say somethin'?
i did not say nothin', boss.
well, whatta we got here?
a lucas jackson.
dragline gives out the names here. you will get yours when he figures you out.
maybe we oughta call you no-ears. you do not listen much, do you, boy?
newmeat looks like a poker player, drag.

man! it is going to be one hot muther today.
bears going to be walkin' the road today.
I am lucky i got a broom. work up top. real easy job. man, it is going to be hot down in that ditch.

koko, why do not you let one of these newmeats take your broom for today?
hell, no. i am not goin' down in the ditch.
you was to sell your job, maybe this lucas war hero would give you a price.
I will give you fifty cents.
fifty cents? sweet job like that worth at least a buck.
I will make it a dollar.
buck is a deal.
I have got this weak heart. too much drinking, i guess. as soon as they find out about it, they will probably send me someplace else.
oh we got our sources... tearing the heads off... what was it... gumball machines? what kind of thing is that for a grown man?
well, you know. small town, not much to do in the evenings. mostly it was settling up old scores.
whatta you so happy about?
i just always did like truck rides.
boss, i made an arrangement with that man to take his broom.
git your shovel and git to work.
i do not think you understand. we made a deal ---
git movin', i said.
but i made this arrangement --
cut that backsass!
had it done in singapore. bunch of us drunk as coots --
hey, tattoo!
-- went down to see this old hag and she had needles the size of that cane.
hot damn, drag. tomorrow's saturday. another week almost made.
i got two years.
only two? man, i already done eight. nothin' to it. just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves.
i did three hitches in the navy. it am not bad. after a while, you get used to it and the time --
plumb busted out. looks like the hard road finally got to mister lucas war hero.
back at it in the mornin'. just need a little nap...
you can not switch 'round jobs, anyway. i figured he knew that.
you can not expect him to learn everything the first day. hopefully it is taught him a very valuable lesson.
course not. he am not in the box 'cause a the joke played on him. he is there 'cause he back sassed a free man. they got their rules and we am not got nothing to do with that. woulda probably happened to him sooner or later, to a complainer like him. he is got to learn the rules same as anybody else.
yeah, those poor old guards need all the help they can get.
you tryin' to say somethin'?
slow down, man. they am not passing out medals for slinging dirt.
i thought you knew, boy... they sentenced me by the mile.
man, this here newmeat parking meter bandit thing what calls itself luke do not know nuthin' 'bout nuthin'.
but damn if he do not look like a fat old dragline.
that am not nuthing compared to what we used to do in san pedro. there was this ensign...
ah believe i smell me a blonde-haired lady.
she looks just like mrs. patricia handy, a married woman... i useta fool with. man, i kin sniff blondes from a hunnert yards and redheads from a mile and a half.
drag's been chain-ganging so long he is got a nose like a bloodhound.
maybe he is been chain-ganging too long.
long enough to see redhots come and redhots go.
oh, man, did you see her? did you see her?
i got eyes, do not i? how my not going to see something like that?
man oh man.

but there is still daylight left.
'bout two hours left.

yeah. come on out, luke.
how did you find me?
helen, she sent along your things with a note, and john here, he wrote to the police.
yeah. well.  gettin' up here, boss.
well, arletta, i got to stand down here.
i allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
like to oblige you, arletta, but right off i do not know where to put my hands on 'em.
sometimes i wisht people was like dogs, luke. comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just do not recognize her pups no more, so she do not have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. she just do not give a damn. they let you smoke?
smokin' it up here, boss.
yeah, well, arletta, you done your best. what i done with myself is my problem.
no it hain't, luke. you am not alone. ever whar you go, I am with you, and so's john.
you never thought that is a heavy load?
we allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. was we wrong?
no. but things am not always like they seem, arletta. you know that. a man's got to go his own way.
well, i do not know, i just wash my hands of it, i guess i just got to love you and let go.
yeah.
what are you doin' here?
we call it abuildin' time, arletta.
i am not askin' what you will do after you get out, because I am going to be dead and it do not matter.
you never wanted to live forever anyways, did you? it was not such a hell of a life.
oh, i had me some high old times. yore old man, luke, was not much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
yeah, would of been nice to of knowed him, the way you talk about him.
you think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. luke?
here, mom.
what went wrong?
nothin'. ever'thing's cool's can be.
no.
tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they am not that much elbow room.
you allus had good jobs, and that girl in kentucky i taken a shine to her.
she took off with that convertible feller...
well, why not? idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
yeah.
I am leavin' the place to john.
that is good: he earned it.
nothin' to do with it. i am not never give john the kind of feelin' i give you, so I am payin' him off now. do not feel you got to say anything. way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with john i just didn't.
gotta go, arletta.
laugh it up, kid. you will make out.
not a liar. you just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.
he is the champeen hog-gut of this camp. hell, i seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. he kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. if you would so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he would even eat that.
nobody kin eat fifty eggs.
you just said he could eat anything.
you ever eat fifty eggs?
koko, write down their names, do not just make marks.
one rule! no throwing up. he throws up, you forfeit everything.
you ever see mah boy throw up? shut your mouth and put up your money!
why did you have to say fifty? why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
fifty's a nice round number.
damn, luke. what is the matter with you? what is the matter with me?
nothin' to worry about. we got a deadlock on that mullet.
what did i do? stole and tole lies. i loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did i do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
we got it locked in the sock.
yeah, i know. but what we got to do first is stretch that l'il old belly of yours -- git it all strained out, in fightin' shape, like a barrage balloon.
you old sack of guts. i had a belly like yours, we would not have nothin' to worry about.
'atsa sign i got me an affectionate nature.
like an elephant.
us elephants may be a lil slow, like in makin' love, but you give us a coupla three days to really get with it an' man -- stand back!
you can not do that!
you jes' watch us!
he peels the eggs himself. that is understood.
you jus' may be great at hangin' paper around the big cities, but us country boys is not entirely brainless. when it comes to the law, nothin' is understood.
one, two, three...
he is going to lose a finger eating eggs like that.
thirty-nine... forty... forty-one... forty-two...
come on, boy, come on, darlin'. you kin do her. just let that old belly sag and enjoy itself. stay loose, buddy. eight more, between you and everlasting glory. little old eggs, pigeon eggs, that is all, fish eggs practically.
all right now: get mad at them eggs. eat it there boy! bite it! gnaw on it!
forty-five.
look at him go. bam! bam!
knock it off, luke! you cain't talk about him that way.
borrowin' or payin' back?
borrowin'.
mister cool hand here is the soft heart in our loan department. next!
sure do... that is why we did not bet with the navy.
oh, that is mah darlin' luke. grins like a baby and bites like a 'gator.
he am not even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
blue'll git him, boss. we will git that bastid, cool hand luke.
captain says to wait 'til the patrol gits here.
she is on to him. you shoulda waited fer me to git her out -- loose like she is, he kin run her crazy.
it am not my fault you do not know how to handle your dogs.
how my suppose to handle a dog someone jus' let loose?
here's the patrol.
she is got him! you hear that?
you going to get used to wearing them chains aftera while, luke. but do not you never stop listenin' to them clinkin'. that is going to remind you of what i been sayin'.
yeah, they sure do make a lot of cold, hard, noise, captain.
jus' take it slow, buddy.
what happened? how far did you get?
shut up. let him eat. do not pay them no mind, boy.
tell us about it.
you steal a car?
yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
well, how far didya get?
fat mile'n a half. hit this red light, highway patrol pulls up alongside.

stop that.
how about you tryin' to make me?
oh for...
dragline, lemme look at the picture.
what for?
come on, drag. lemme take a look.
it would go to your coconut head. you would start getting ideas. maybe even pass right out.
a cold drink.
a cold drink? you mean one cold drink? to feast yore starvin' fishy l'il eyes on the picture? a true vision of paradise itself? with two of the angels right there in plain sight a- friskin' round with mah boy?
a cold drink? okay?
well --- okay. it is a deal. one cold drink, if'n you please. in advance. one chilly bottle right here in mah hot l'il hand... that goes for the rest of you mullet-heads, too.
that is my baby.
he is going to be awright.
picture's a phoney... cost me a week's pay.
a phoney? whatta you mean, a phoney?
we saw the broads.
yeah. did you have them both at once or --
but -- but --
that is all there was. listen. open your eyes. stop beatin' it. and stop feedin' off me. now get out of the way. give me some air.
you was eyeballin', luke. you can not gitcha mind on them weeds if yer eyeballin'...
boss, you do not need reasons to hit me.
he will never make it.
what are you talking about?
he does not know when to give in. they will kill him.
give in? that is our luke out there.
that ole box collapse and fall apart before luke calls quits.
your luke's got more guts than brains.
i do not see no sign of guts in you.
no. no chains either.
you am not man enough to wear them!
but you are dog enough. maybe they will let you sleep outside the box near your master.
big deal paper hanger! hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. like breakin' open a piggy bank.
you have been having bad luck with masters, have not you? your last one left you when the cops came... and now luke. you should complain to the s.p.c.a.
you phony creep!
then how come it am not done yet?
i do not know, boss.
you do not know!
what is all this dirt in the yard?
i... i... i...

do not hit me! please, for god's sake, do not hit me.
you got your mind right, luke?
yes, boss. i got it right.
supposin' you was to backslide on us, luke? supposin' you was to backsass or try to run again...
no, boss! i won't. i won't. i got my mind right. i got it right, boss. please do not hit me no more.
luke, you run again and we will kill you.
i know, i know. just do not hit me.

foolin', hell! i would have eaten that dirt for them. they coulda used my head for a shovel and a my face for a broom... they just never did get a piece of my mind.
and all the time you was plannin' on runnin' again.
whoee, it is cold. wisht i had somethin' to eat. bread, grits, beans even. soon's we get to my house, we are going to have us one big meal and then I am going to show you some farm girls that...
we am not goin' nowhere.
what you talkin' about, luke? we are together, you and me, just like always. now the thing we got to work out is how to get koko outa there and then the terrible trio be all complete again. man, this old free world am not going to know which ear to stand on.
yeah, well, you and koko kin handle it without me.
what you mean, luke?
I have done enough world-shakin' for a while. you do the rest for me. send me a postcard about it.
but, luke...
take it easy, drag.
luke. where you goin?
on my own.
but what am i going to do all by myself?  oh if'n i had not lost mah head. i only had two more years to go. but when i saw you tearin' down with that truck... but you right luke. we oughta split up. be safer for us both.
is that your answer, old man? you are a hardcase too, am not you?
luke, are you alright?... they got us, boy. they are out there thicker'n flies. bosses and dogs and sheriffs and more guns than i ever seen in my life. we do not have a chance, luke... they caught up with me right after we split up and they was aimin' to kill you, luke. but i got 'em to promise if you give up peaceful, they would not even whip you this time.
do we even get our same bunks back?
why sure, luke. i mean i did not talk to them about that. but why not? they are reasonable, luke. hell, we only been gone a coupla hours.
you do not understand a thing, do you, drag?
luke, you got to listen to me. all you got to do is just give up nice and quiet, just play it cool.
like i always do?
thass right. just play it...
