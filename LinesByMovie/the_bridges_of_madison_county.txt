you feeling better franny?
yes. I am fine. it is just this heat i think.
it is a chicago station. i found it the other day.
kinda pretty. is this uh... jazz kinda singing?
i do not know. can we turn it off? i have such a headache.
sure.
are you seeing betty tonight?
nah.
'bout 4:30.
well you should all go to bed early. I will do the cleaning up.
explain to me again why we did not do this in des moines in an air conditioned office?
mom's orders.
lawyer here?
i have some sandwich fixings if you are hungry.
no, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. she told me all the dirt. i forgot how interesting things can get around here. it was so good to see them. the last time we visited they were in europe. he is doing so well. he ordered champagne. for lunch! i nearly died.
i nearly died when we split the bill.
michael does not understand. people who make the kind of money my brother makes do not carry money on them. they keep it all in various accounts.
then we should have had lunch at the bank.
boy. it sure has been a long time.
we were here two christmases ago.
well, that is a long time.
it is not that long.
well, why do not i just say black so you can say white!  do not be surprised to find your brother has not changed an iota. he hardly ever talks and when he does it is in that tone! you should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "worth every penny."
so!
you said it in that tone! like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
oh jesus.
i simply can not stand that tone!
i am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I have done!
I am sure you have not done anything. have some iced tea. how are the kids?
he dropped them off at betty's mom. where is steve?
he is not coming.
i thought everything was arranged.
well, there is a problem.
what problem?
your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
cremated?!
eeeww!
i know. i do not understand it either.
when did she decide this?
apparently just before her death.
well, that is crazy. i do not know anybody who gets cremated.
my jewish friend's grandmother did.
well, no one in my family did! dad bought cemetery plots at oak ridge. one for him, one for mom.
it clearly states in the will --
i do not care what it says! maybe mama was delirious, you know. she did not know what she was saying. if she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
well, she was very specific. she wanted her ashes to be thrown over roseman bridge.
what!
how bizarre!
mr. peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
well, it was notarized, and witnessed by a mrs. lucy delaney. maybe you can ask her.
who the hell is lucy delaney?
i remember a mrs. delaney but mama told me years ago she died.
well, i do not care if it is legal or not, we are not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can not even go visit her because she is going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
we are not doing it! I am not even sure it is christian.
maybe it is an italian thing. their mother was italian.
does not matter. move on.
it is a beautiful picture of her.
why are there two deeds here?
oh, just a old letter from a friend.
no treasure maps, huh?
no.
yeah.
michael.
what?!
come here a minute.
i do not mind waiting.
well, there is a lot of boring stuff to do. lists of people we have to write to. find mama's relatives addresses in italy -- stuff like that.
well, i can help.
i said no!
i do not need instructions from you to bathe!  i knew you would do this! i knew I would come all the way here and be shut out as usual! i came to be here for you! i did not have to come!  lord knows i was never much welcome in this house before. apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
aw, betty.
carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
no. you can have them.
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and i ask myself, "what happened to me in madison county?" i struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we are on separate roads. but then i look through the lens of my camera, and you are there. i start to write an article and i find myself writing it to you. it is clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
goddamn sonofabitch! i do not want to hear anymore! sonofabitch! burn the damn thing! i do not want to hear it! throw it away!
what is he saying now?
well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the national geographic magazine. he as a photographer. he promises not to write again. then all it says is...  i love you... robert.
robert! jesus! I will kill him.
that would be some trick. he is already dead. that is what this other letter is.  from his attorney. he left most of his things to mama and requested...
what?
that he be cremated and his ashes thrown on roseman bridge.
damn him! i knew mama would not have thought of that herself. it was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! when did the bastard die?
'82.
wait a minute! that was thirty years after daddy. do you think...?
i do not know. I am completely in the dark here. that is what i get for moving away.
this happened way before we both got married. i... i can not believe it.  you think she had sex with him?
my lord. it must feel real nice living inside your head with peter pan and the easter bunny.
do not talk to me like that. she was my mother for christsakes. and now i find out she was... she was a --!
do not say that!
well, what am i supposed to think?
i can not believe she never told me? we spoke at least once a week. how could she do that?
how did she meet him? did dad know? anything else in that envelope?
no, i do not think so. i --
i can not believe she is making jokes.
sshhh. "after going through the safety deposit box, I am sure you will find you are way to this letter. it is hard to write this to my own children. i could let this die with the rest of me, i suppose.  but as one gets older, one fears subside. what becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. it is easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it is something that just happens. i do not know if it is as simple for children. you are all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. but i thought it was important to give you that chance. to give you the opportunity to love me for all that i was..."
grateful!?
"... it is all there in the three notebooks. read them in order. if you do not want to, i suppose that is okay too. but in that case i want you to know something -- i never stopped loving your father. he was a very good man. it is just that my love for robert was different. he brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. he made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
that is it!
what are you doing?
this is crazy. she waits till she is dead to tell us all this. well, i got news for you. she was my mother. that is enough for me. i do not have to know who she was.
well, I would like to read them.
no. we are going to lock this up and --
stop it!  i want to read them! if you do not want to, then just leave. but do not you push me around like I am some mule you paid for -- i already got a husband!
what time is it?
later. go back to sleep.
where you going?
I am not tired. i thought i might finish carolyn's skirt.
now?!  it is after eleven.
i can not sleep.
again? maybe you should see a doctor.
I am not sick, richard. I am just not tired, now go back to sleep before you are up for the whole night too!
"i had forgotten this. i had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. then i remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. and i remembered it was my idea. i remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. i had forgotten that too. and i wondered, as i sat there... how many other things I would forgotten."
frannie.
okay.
what is her name?
betty.
what is she like?
okay.
uh... yeah. yeah. she is real nice.
well, what is nice about her? tell us!
well, she's... she is real pretty and ... and she is got a cute shape... she is a good sport, ya know, for laughs and  ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
is not that nice? you should bring her home to meet us!
I am positive.
I am going to miss you.
it is only four days.
oh, this heat! times like this i wish we took that offer from your brother and moved on up to michigan.
they got heat in michigan.
not this kind of heat.
heat is heat.
heat is not heat! there is different kinds! and this heat is much hotter than what they got in michigan. you go and call your brother and see if he do not say the same thing.
I will get right on it.
mrs. delaney.  did you hear the latest?
no, what?
well, nobody put a gun to his head.
oh, shut up! it is the woman who is in control of these situations. men do not know which end is up till a woman points.
see. money do not buy happiness. i must say, she is taking it well.
I would kill him. him and that redfield woman. together. first one then the other. and then I would laugh.
I would laugh first then I would kill them. make sure they heard me laughing.
she is changed.
oh, yes.
she used to be so friendly.
what do you know about "the changes"?
well, i did not know they was a secret club.
do not talk about what you do not know. besides, she is too young for "the changes."
my niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
no. what a tragedy. what happened?
she changed.
mrs. johnson! mrs. johnson! is it true cary grant has proposed to you?
yes. and I have accepted.
what about his engagement to dyan cannon?
i said to him cary you are being ridiculous. you are more than half her age. he said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
what about your husband?
I am very sad but richard said that since it is cary grant, he completely understands. I am also taking mrs. delaney away from this town. she will be living with cary and i in beverly hills.
are you supposed to be in iowa?
yeah.
roseman bridge?
that is it.
well, you are pretty close. it is only about two miles from here.
oh, terrific. which way?
if I am not taking you away from anything.
no. i was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait.  i just have to get my shoes.
pretty country.
hmm-mmm.
there is a wonderful smell about iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. do you know what i mean?
no.
i can not describe it. i think it is from the loam in the soil. this very rich, earthy kind of... alive... no. no, that is not right. can you smell it?
maybe it is because i live here.
that must be it. it is a great smell.
are you from washington originally?
uh-huh. lived there till i was twenty or so and then moved to chicago when i got married.
oh. when did you move back?
after the divorce.
oh.
how long you been married?
uh... uh...  umm... long time.
you do not look like a native, if you do not mind my saying so.
no, i do not mind. I am not from here. i was born in italy.
well, from italy to iowa -- that is a story!  whereabouts in italy?
small town on the eastern side no one's ever heard of called bari.
oh yeah, bari. I have been there.
no, really?
oh, yeah. actually, i had an assignment in greece and i had to go through bari to get the boat at brindisi. but it looked so pretty i got off and stayed for a few days. breathtaking country.
you just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
yeah. excuse me a sec.
so, how long you have been living here?
long.  you just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
yeah.
this will not take long. I am shooting tomorrow morning. i just need to do some prep work.
i do not mind waiting.
this time of year.
would you do me a favor and go to the truck? inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. would you grab me one?
oh there you are.
oh! you caught me.
men sill give women flowers, do not they? i mean, as a sign of appreciation? I am not that out of date, am i?
no, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
what!
are you by nature a sadistic person?
no, I am not.  i do not know why i said that. I have been in a very... strange mood all day. I have never done anything like that before. it's... I am just...  well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
looking for something in particular? there is not much of a selection.
i found this chicago station before. wait a minute...  here it is.
oh, that is nice.
want another cigarette?
sure.
well, thank you for all your help, mrs. johnson.
francesca.
francesca. robert.
lemon?
sure.
mind if i smoke?
not at all.
sure you want to keep those in the house?
I am so sorry about that. it was rude. i think i just got nervous for some reason.
i thought it was funny.
where are you staying while you are here?
a little place with cabins. the something-motor inn. i have not checked in yet.
and how long are you here for?
as long as it takes, i might stay a week. no more i do not think. where is your family?
my husband took the kids to the illinos state fair. my daughter's entering a prize steer.
oh. how old?
about a year and a half.
no, your kids.
oh. michael's 17 and carolyn's 16.
must be nice having kids.
everything does. one of the laws of nature. people are always so afraid of change. but if you look at it like it is something you can count on happening, it is actually a comfort. not many things you can count on for sure.
i guess. except I am one of the people it frightens.
i doubt that.
why?
italy to iowa? I would call that a change.
richard was in the army. i met him while i was living in naples. i did not know where iowa was. i only cared that it was america. and of course, being with richard.
what is he like?
he is very... clean.
clean?
no. i mean yes, he is clean but he is also other things. he is a very hard worker. very honest. very caring. gentle. good father.
and clean.
yes. very clean.
feeling better?
much.
is the dizziness gone?
i think so.
i better go. you sure you are all right?  it is been a pleasure. sincerely.
i feel so embarrassed.
why? you uncorked a bottle. from what i can tell, i got here just in time. any later and you would have made the front page, running down main street naked, smoking camels out of your butt.
but i... we do not even know each other.
you have no reason to feel ashamed. you have not said anything you do not have a right to. and if anybody tells you different -- you just send them to me.
would you like to stay for dinner?  there are not many choices in town and ... anyway, you would have to eat alone. so would i.
that is very nice of you. i do not get many dinner invitations on the job. it would be a welcome change. thanks.
help cook?
sure. men cook. we do not all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
okay.
what?
she starts sniffing me.
oh my god...  you are blushing.
it is still a very sensitive memory for me.
then what happened?
we got engaged.
oh you!
you ought to write these stories down.
nah. I have tried. my writing's too technical, i think. problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. i better just stick to making pictures.
"making pictures." i like that. you really love what you do, do not you?
I am kind of obsessed by it, actually.
why, do you think?
i do not know if obsessions have reasons. i think that is why they are obsessions.
you sound like an artist.
no. i would not say that. national geographic is not exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. they like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. i do not mind really. I am not artist. I would faced that a long time ago. it is the course of being well-adjusted. I am too normal.
i do not think you are normal.
i did not mean that the way it sounded.
well, let's just call it a compliment and move on.  did you love teaching?
and did you?
I would like to think so. i know one of them went on to medical school.
why did you stop?
my children. and richard did not like my working.
do you miss it?
i do not know. I have never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you have ever been to? unless you are tired of talking about it.
you are asking a man if he is too tired to talk about himself? you do not get out much, do you?
I am sorry. that was...
no. it is all right. i just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
this is your home. it is not nowhere. and it is not dull.
my god. how I would love to see that.
they have safaris for tourists now. maybe you can convince your husband.
well, it is kind of buggy out there.
have no fear. this shoshone medicine woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.
you drink bug repellent?
no, you rub it on you. i have some in the truck. do not go away.
smells like dirt.
you get used to it.
when?
you want to go back in?
no. I am all right. it is working.
you have got it all right here, you know. it is just as beautiful as any other place I have seen. god, it knocks me out.
what?
this "... of what i call god and fools can nature." who wrote that?
umm, i do not know. i can look it up.
I would appreciate it. i like knowing who I am stealing from. if you can not create art i think the least you can do is recognize it around you, do not you think? there is...  ... so much beauty.
you sure you will not let me help you with those dishes?
no. I will do them later.
francesca?
what?
are you all right?
yes.
francesca?
what?
we are not doing anything wrong, do you.
he is getting her drunk. that is what happened. jesus, maybe he forced himself. that is why she could not tell us.
oh, he did not. he is such a nice guy.
nice? he is trying to sleep with somebody is wife.
i do not think so. not yet anyway. and besides, something like that does not make you a bad person. he reminds me of steve in a way. steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he is still a real nice guy. he just should not be married.  at least not to me. you getting hungry? I am hungry.
i had no idea it is gotten that bad, sis.
oh, do not feel sorry for me. please. no one's forcing me to stay.
then why do you?
and do what? live alone? go back to school? find someone else? start a magazine for confused woman? ... what if i can not do any of those things?
do you mind if i... ask you why you got divorced?
not at all. i was not around much... so why did i get married? well, i thought it was a good idea at the time. have a home base. roots. you can get lost moving around so much.
so what happened?
i never got lost. for some reason, I am more at home everywhere than at one place. so i decided I will think of myself as some kind of world citizen. i belong everywhere and nowhere. I am kin to everyone, and no one in particular. see, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it is kind of hard to break.
you must get lonely at times.
never touch the stuff. I have got friends all over the world. good friends i can see when i want, if i want.
woman friends, too?
I am a loner, I am not a monk.
you really do not need anyone?
no, i think i need everyone! i love people. i want to meet them all! i just think there are too many out there saying "this is mine." or "she's mine." too many lines have been drawn. world's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. he wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
why does not it scare you?
i embrace mystery. i do not know what is coming. and i do not mind.
do you ever regret it? the divorce, i mean.
no.
do you ever regret not having a family?
not everybody's supposed to have a family.
but -- how can you just live for what you want? what about other people?
i told you, i love other people.
but no one in particular.
no. but i love them just the same.
but it is not the same.
that is not what you are saying. i know it is not the same. what you are saying is, it is not as good. or it is not as normal or proper.
no, I am just saying --
I am a little sick of this american family ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. i guess you think I am just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family does not necessarily mean they are hypnotized. just because I have never seen a gazelle stampede does not mean I am asleep in the world.
do you want to leave your husband?
my mistake. i apologize.
what made you ask such a question?
i thought that is what we were doing -- asking questions.
i thought we were just having a conversation. you seem to be reading all this meaning into it. meanings i must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
i already apologized.
listen, I am sorry i --
no, no. forgive me. i made a mistake. it was an inappropriate thing to ask.
... i feel like something is been spoiled now.
francesca?
yes! hi.
am i interrupting anything?
no. i was just... no.
I am sorry i did not call sooner, but i just read your note. i stuffed it into my pocket. the light was fading and i had to get my shot.
the light was fading. huh-huh.
i would love to come for dinner.
wonderful. uh...
listen, i have to shoot cedar bridge until a little after sunset. i want a few night shots. would you like to come with me? if you are interested...
oh, sure. great.
I will pick you up.
no. I will drive myself. i have a few errands. I will meet you there.
okay. see you later.
yeah. see you later.
it is robert.
oh, hi. look, I am running a little late, but I will still...
listen, do not take this the wrong way but, I am wondering if this is such a good idea.
oh.
i uh... i had lunch in town today. happened to cross paths with "that redfield woman." i apologize. i thought you were half-joking about that.
oh. i guess you got the whole story.
the cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
i think he is running for town crier next year.
i now know more about their affair than i remember about my marriage.  francesca, the last thing i want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it is just -- i mean, it is nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or...
i understand.  that is very kind of you.
yeah?
i want you to come.
sorry I am late. richard called.
oh, how is he?
fine. they are all having a good time. how many more shots do you have?
couple. want to help?
can i help?
actually, no. I have got everything under control. I would like to clean up myself a bit. I am going to take a bath. dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
how about if i set the table?
sure.
would you like a beer for your bath?
yes, that would be nice.
are you comfortable?  do you... want to move to the bedroom?
no. i can't. not yet.
you want to eat something?
are you hungry?
no.
take me somewhere.
what?
right now. tell me someplace you have been -- someplace on the other side of the world. anywhere but here.
how about italy?
yes.
how about bari?
yes. tell me about the day you got off the train.
have you ever been to that station?
yes.
you know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
oh, I am sorry.
it is okay. it is not that hot anymore. thanks god.
i just feel like I am getting a little ... out of control that is all. it is kind of frightening.
why?
why!? because, I am having thoughts i hardly know what to do with. i... can not seem to... stop them.
nobody's asking you to.
and arraccinos and zeppolis. yes! i know it!
i sat outside and had coffee.
where? near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
near the church.
i sat there once. it was hot. like today. I would been shopping. i had all these bags around my feet i kept having to move every time the waiter came by...
bar across the street.
have you called betty?  maybe you should.
i found out who lucy delaney is.  remember the delaneys from hillcrest road?
yeah. but i thought she died.
he remarried. apparently they were having an affair for years. apparently the first mrs. delaney was a bit of a stiff.
you mean -- she did not like sex?
i bet mom could have helped her.
boy. all these years I have resented not living the wild life in some place like paris and all the time i could have moved back to iowa... are you drunk?
not yet. you want to go?
i think i better. between the book and the coffee, I am this close to raping the busboy.
i used to love this place. i used to take kathy reynolds down here.
you never dated kathy reynolds!
not officially. her and steve kendall were pinned at birth. but i was crazy about her. and for about three months, i managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
i never knew that.
nobody did.
was this during betty?
everything was during betty. god we were so young. why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I have never cheated on betty. not once we were married, i mean.
did we want to?
only about a thousand times. what do i do now? "what's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
what gets me is I am 46 years old. I have been in this crummy fucking marriage -
carolyn!
-- for over twenty years because that is what i was taught -- you stick with it! normal people do not get divorced. i can not remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to europe, for christ's sake -- quite frankly, i do not think he ever did! and now i find out in between bake sales, my mother was anais nin!
what about me! i feel really weird. like she cheated on me, not dad. is not that sick? i do not mean i wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. you are sort of made to feel like you are the prince of the kingdom, ya know? and in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother does not need sex anymore because she has you.
you are right -- that is sick.
on that one is beautiful. look at their expressions. as if the camera were not on them at all. as if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling.
he is a genius. they are not photographs -- they are stories, entire histories captured in moments.
i bet you could do a book.
no. i couldn't.
why do you say that?
because i already tried once.
but you do not mind.
no, i do not mind.
what were you like when you were younger?
trouble. why?
i just wondered. why were you trouble?
i had a temper.
what were your parents like?
i can not do this, honey.
what?
try and live a lifetime before friday. cram it all in.
you are somewhere else, where?
just that it is been a perfect day and that I would like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
uh-huh. and?
you are right, you know. we do not have much time.
oh my god...!
what happened?
i was paying the check. she ran outside. i told her to wait for me right here! oh god, where is she? rebecca!
think for a second. is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
i do not remember!
about an hour ago.
they are not going to find her!
yes, they are.
where was she?
across the street. she went into the park and got turned around and did not know her way out.
i do not know why I am so tired all of a sudden.
long day. go to sleep.
am i too heavy for you?
no.
sleep all right?
yes, thanks.
good. more coffee?  robert, i hope you do not mind my asking, but i feel like i should.
what?
well, these... women friends of yours... all over the world. how does it work? do you see some of them again? do you forget others? do you write them now and then? how do you manage it?
i... what do you want?
well, i just want to know the procedure. i do not want to upset your routine. do you want any jam?
routine! i do not have a routine. and if you think that is what this is -
well, what is this?
well, why is that up to me? you are the one who is married. you told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
to do what? be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? i mean, what would be the point. would you pass the butter?
i was honest with you. i told you who i was.
yes. absolutely. you have this habit of not needing and that it is hard to break. i understand.  of course, in that case, why sleep -- you do not need rest or for that matter eat, you do not need food.
what are you doing?
gee, i do not know. i guess I am not cut out to be a world citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
how do you know what i experience?
i know you! what can this possibly mean to anyone who does not "need" meaning -  "who goes with the mystery" -- who pretends he is not scared to death.
stop it!
you have no idea what you have done to me, do you? and after you leave, I am going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. if anything happened at all! and I will have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in romania if you will sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
what do you want me to say?
i do not want you to say anything. i do not need you to say anything.
stop it!
fine. more eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
i told you! i will not apologize for who i am.
no one's asking you to!
i will not be made to feel like I have done something wrong.
you will not be made to feel! period. you have carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you have touched our lives! well, go to hell! it is not human not to feel lonely -- it is not human not to afraid! you are a hypocrite and you are a phony!
i do not want to need you!
why?
because i can not have you!
what does that have to do with it?
if I have done anything to make you think that what is happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then i do apologize.
what makes it different, robert?
madge?
hi. i made some brown betty. i sent floyd off to town with the boy. i said -  "floyd, I am going to visit my girlfriend and spend the afternoon and that is all there is to it. he said who is going to make lunch? i said I am taking a sick day. eat at the dinner." is not that hilarious?  he did not dare raise an eyebrow -- i do not even want to tell you how late he was out last night with those good for nothings from the sandford ranch. i am so sorry, honey, i let two days pass before i came by, but with the boy home the time just escapes me. have you heard from richard? how is the fair? god, it is hot.
madge. please. something is happened. I have met someone. I have fallen in love in a way I have never thought could happen my entire life. it is our last day together. i feel like I am going to die when he leaves. please. help me.
oh, honey. I am so sorry. but you have got to be grateful for even feeling the little you have be given. believe me. go to him. do not let him leave without these new precious hours you have got left. and if you need anyone to cry on, you know where i am.
i do not know. i woke up a little dizzy. i did not sleep well. i think i need to lay down.
you want me to call the doctor?
no, no. i just did not sleep well. I am not used to sleeping alone. and this heat. would you mind?
no, of course not. I will just clean up.
no, leave it. I will do it later. listen, maybe you and floyd can come for dinner on saturday. I am sure richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
oh, that will be nice.
no matter how i keep turning it around in my mind -- it does not seem like the right thing.
for who?
for anyone. they will never be able to live through the talk. richard will never be able to. he does not deserve that. he has not hurt anyone in his life.
then he can move! people move!
his family's lived for almost a hundred years. richard does not know how to live anywhere else. and the kids...
the kids are grown! they do not need you anymore. you told me that. they hardly talk to you.
no, they do not say much. but carolyn's 16. she is just about to find out about all this for herself -- she is going to fall in love, she is going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. if i leave what does that say to her?
what about us? what about me?
you have got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. it will all change.
yeah. it could get better.
no matter how much distance we put between us and this house, i bring with it with me. and I will feel it every minute we are together. and I will blame loving you for how much it hurts. and then even these four days will not be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
francesca, listen to me. you think what is happened to us happens to just anybody? what we feel for each other? how much we feel? we are not even two separate people anymore. some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people do not even think it exists and you are going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? that staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you do not feel apart of anymore -- you are telling me that is the right thing to do!?
we are the choices we have made, robert.
to hell with you!
robert. please.  you do not understand -- no one does. when a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. you build a life of details. you become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. and when they leave they take your life of details with them. and then you are expected move again only you do not remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. not even yourself. you never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
but now that you have it -
i want to keep it forever. i want to love you the way i do now the rest of my life. do not you understand -- we will lose it if we leave. i can not make an entire life disappear to start a new one. all i can do is try to hold onto to both. help me. help me not lose loving you.
i do not know. please...
I am going to be here a few more days. I will be at the inn. we have some time. let's not say any more now.
no. do not do this.
i can not say goodbye yet! we will leave it for now. we are not saying goodbye. we are not making any decision. maybe you will change your mind. maybe we will accidentally run into each other and ... and you will change your mind.
robert, if that happens, you will have to decide. i will not be able to.
want anything special for dinner?
hmm. how about that brown sugar meat loaf you make?
okay.
franny?
hmm?
i just want to say... i know you had your own dreams. I am sorry i could not give them to you. i love you so much.
