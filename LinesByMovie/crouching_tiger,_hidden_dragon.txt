mu bai...it's been too long.
it has.  how is business?
good.  and how are you?
fine.
monk zheng said you were at wudan mountain.  he said you were practicing deep meditation.
yes.
the mountain must be so peaceful... i envy you.  my work keeps me so busy, i hardly get any rest.
i left the training early.
why?  you are a wudan fighter. training is everything.
during my meditation training... i came to a place of deep silence... i was surrounded by light... time and space disappeared.  i had come to a place my master had never told me about.
you were enlightened?
no.  i did not feel the bliss of enlightenment.  instead... i was surrounded by an endless sorrow.  i could not bear it.  i broke off my meditation.  i could not go on. there was something... pulling me back.
what was it?
something i can not let go of.  you are leaving soon?
we are preparing a convoy for a delivery to peking.
perhaps i could ask you to deliver something to sir te for me.
the green destiny sword?  you are giving it to sir te?
i am.  he has always been our greatest protector.
i do not understand.  how can you part with it?  it has always been with you.
too many men have died at its edge. it only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.
you use it justly, you are worthy of it.
it is time for me to leave it behind.
so what will you do now?
come with me to peking.  you can give the sword to sir te yourself. it will be just like old times.
first i must visit my master's grave.  it is been many years since jade fox murdered him.  i have yet to avenge his death.  and yet I am thinking of quitting.  i must pray for his forgiveness.
join me once you have finished.  i can wait for you in peking.
perhaps.
this is li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  he is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  it is too fine a gift. i cannot accept it.
sir te!  it has brought him as much trouble as glory.  help him to leave these troubles behind. otherwise, he will never be able to start anew.
all right.  I will act as the sword's custodian.
you have always been so good to li mu bai and me.  please accept our thanks.
please do not be such a stranger. you will stay the night as my guest. now, shu lien... tell me something. and forgive me for prying.  your father was a great friend to me, and i think of you as my own daughter.
please, sir te, what is it?
li mu bai giving up his sword and his warrior days... maybe he is trying to tell you something?
i do not know...
do not be coy.  I have always known about your feelings for each other. all these years, it is a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. you are both wasting precious time.
i beg your pardon.  li mu bai and i are not cowards.
when it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  tell me if li mu bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I will give him an earful!
it is heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
the handle is heavy.  and the blade is no ordinary metal.  still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. you are just not used to handling it.
but i have had much practice.  as a child in the west, a platoon lived with us.  they would let me play with their weapons.  the scabbard is so beautiful.
beautiful but dangerous.  once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire.  it is 400 years old.
exquisite!  you said it belongs to...
my friend li mu bai.  he is given it to sir te as a gift.
li mu bai!  the famous warrior? why would he give his sword to sir te?
you are too young to understand.
you are a sword fighter too?
yes, i am.  but i prefer the machete.  certain moves, however, call for a sword.
really?
it must be exciting to be a fighter, to be totally free!
fighters have rules too: friendship, trust, integrity... without rules, we would not survive for long.
I have read all about people like you. roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
writers would not sell many books if they told how it really is.
but you are just like the characters in the stories.
sure.  no place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... they tell you all about that in those books?
you know what i mean.  I am getting married soon, but i have not lived the life i want.
so i heard.  congratulations.  it is the most important step in a woman's life, is not it?
you are not married, are you?
what do you think?
no!  you could not roam around freely if you were.
you are probably right.
please sit.
I have made you silk pajamas.  do you want to change into them?
put them down.
i heard you met shu lien today.
do you know her?
she is one of those.  your mother would not want you consorting with her kind.
I will socialize with whomever i please.
do not invite danger into your father's house.
I am tired now.
go to bed then.  miss has grown up, and is getting married soon.  god knows what the future will bring.
it will be just the same.  enough! I am tired.
autumn is coming.  I will shut the windows for you.
it is jade fox!
we must avenge mother!
you are mistaken.  we are just street performers.  we were rehearsing.
father!
has governor yu ever seen the sword?
yes, though i doubt he is involved in this.
but the sword could be in his compound.
then someone is trying to set him up. we should inform li mu bai.
this spells trouble.
i have a guest.
I have missed you.
how so?
I am bored.
you are doing calligraphy?
I will write your name.  just for fun.
you write gracefully.  calligraphy is so similar to fencing.
maybe it is.  i would not know.
please.
thank you for seeing me.  i hear your wedding day is near.  you must be overwhelmed by the preparations.
I am hardly doing a thing.  the less i think of it the better.  my parents are arranging everything. the gous are a very powerful family. my marrying one will be good for my father's career.
you are fornuate to marry into such a noble family.
am i?  i wish i were like the heroes in the books i read.  like you and li mu bai.  i guess I am happy to be marrying.  but to be free to live my own life, to choose whom i love... that is true happiness.
do you think so?  let me tell you a story.
about you and li mu bai?
yes.  did you know i was once engaged to be married?
no, really?
his name was meng si zhao.  he was a brother to li mu bai by oath. one day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of li mu bai's enemy.  after, li mu bai and i went through a lot together.  our feelings for each other grew stronger.  but how could we dishonor meng's memory?  so the freedom you talk about, i too desire it.  but i have never tasted it.
too bad for meng, but it is not your fault, or li mu bai's.
i am not an aristocrat, as you are... but i must still respect a woman's duties.
do not distance us.  from now on, let's be like sisters.
then as a sister, let me wish you happiness in your marriage.
who are you?
wait!  I am a friend!
i do not care about your sword.
why were you spying on the yus?
I am looking for someone.  jade fox. I am a police inspector from shaan xi, gen su district.  jade fox is a master criminal.  i hear she infiltrated the yus.  she must have come with them when they transferred here.  but with yu's reputation, i can not just go in and accuse her.
this jade fox is a woman?
yes.
then leave her to me.
pardon me, but i doubt you can handle her.  my wife was quite a martial arts expert.  jade fox killed her.  so you see, this is personal.  leave her to me.
they are gone.
what does it say?
"we'll settle this at midnight on yellow hill."  good, the fox is out of her hole.
sir te believes it is a ploy cast suspicion on governor yu.
but something is going on at the yu household.
what have you discovered?
jade fox?  impossible.
you always suspected she would fled to the west.
i did not think she would dare come back to peking!
is there any place safer than under the nose of governor yu?
so i shall avenge my master's death after all.
be careful.  sir te requires discretion.  official business is difficult enough.  do not let personal feelings make it worse. and i do not know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
did you see who posted it?
no.
it says jade fox is hiding at yu's. on the night of the theft there was a brawl near yu's.  were you involved?
it was bo, sir te's man.  i hear he followed the thief to the yus'.
have you questioned him yet?
no, not yet...
but your men are watching over yu's compund?
no, I would already sent them home. you can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I will get it back soon using my own methods.
that is not what i meant.  i do not care about the sword.
what do you mean?  did not you come back here for it?
i do not know it was stolen until i got here.
then, why did you come?
well, we had talked...
if you surrender now, you will suffer less.  but if you resist, i will not stop until you are dead.
father!  let me avenge my mother's death.
who are you?  why is the green destiny in your possession?
what is it to you?
my name is li mu bai.  the green destiny is mine.  jade fox can not be your master.  where did you learn that "xuan piu" move?
I am just playing around.
tell me, who is your master?
let's go!
we must be careful.  governor yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  it might get sir te in trouble.
this is a delicate matter.
sir te, can you find some excuse to invite madam yu and her daughter?
what do you have in mind?
the best way to trap a fox is through her cubs.
madam te is certainly spoiling us with these wedding gifts.  she is being so considerate.
I am sorry she is not feeling well enough to receive you today.
i heard sir te lost something.  and now madame te's not feeling well...
we know who stole the missing item. if the thief returns it, I am sure sir te will pursue the matter no further.
that is good.  sometimes the help can not keep their hands to themselves. it is very embarassing.
sir te knows that even well-meaning people can make mistakes... that can bring ruin to themselves and their families.
but do not be too lenient.
no mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in peking.
a murderer?
yes.  the very killer of li mu bai's own master.  last night, she killed a policeman who had tracked her down.
a female criminal!  now that is news!
you say she killed a policeman?
yes, from the west.  he went undercover and and followed her here,
maybe the murderer and the thief are one and the same.
i doubt it.  this thief... it very unusual...
is not it a bit too late to be out? you have brought me the sword?
i do as i please.
where is your master?
what is it to you?
do you think you are a real master?
like most things, i am nothing. it is the same for this sword.  all of it is simply a state of mind.
stop talking like a monk!  just fight!
then tell me where jade fox is.
on guard!
real sharpness comes without effort.
go ahead.
why should i?  you need practice. i can teach you to fight with the green destiny, but first you must learn to hold it in stillness.
why do you want to teach me?
I have always wanted a disciple worthy of wudan's secrets.
and if i use them to kill you?
that is a risk I am willing to take. deep down, you are good.  even jade fox could not corrupt you.
you are home late... or should i say early?
why are you still here?  you killed a policeman.  you should leave! you will bring ruin on my whole family.
they would not have found me if you had not stolen the sword.  like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  you, too, are responsible for that death.  come with me.  you do not want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  denied your talent... as a master and disciple we will rule.
I will never live as a thief!
you are already a thief.
that was just for fun.  how can i leave?  where would i go?
wherever we want.  we will get rid of anyone in our way.  even your father.
shut up!
it is the giang hu fighter lifestyle... kill or be killed. exciting, is not it?
i owe you nothing.
yes, you do!  you are still my disciple.
you think you have been teaching me all these years from the manual? you could not even decipher the symbols!
i studied the diagrams.  but you hid the details!
you would not have understood, even if i had tried to explain.  you know... you have gone as far as you can go.  i hid my skills so as not to hurt you.
if i had not seen you fight with li mu bai, I would still be ignorant of all you have hidden from me.
master... i started learning from you in secret when i was 10.  you enchanted me with the world of giang hu.  but once i realized i could surpass you, i became so frightened!  everything fell apart. i had no one to guide me, no one to learn from.
believe me, I have a lesson or two left to teach you!
i admit, getting it back makes me realize how much I would missed it.
but it is not your sword anymore. you gave it to sir te.
true.  but i must borrow it for one last mission.  jade fox must die at its edge.  did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?
my job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone.  i was not about to ruin her life, or her father's.
you did your job well.  but, this girl... i saw her last night.
i knew she would intrigue you.
she needs direction... and training.
she is an aristocrat's daughter. she is not one of us.  in any case, it will all be over soon.  you will kill fox, and she will marry.
that is not for her.  she should come to wudan and become a disciple.
but wudan does not accept women.
for her, they might make an exception.  if not, I am afraid she will become a poisoned dragon.
it is not our affair.  even if wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
i thought by giving away the sword, i could escape the giang hu world. but the cycle of bloodshed continues.
i wish there were something more i could do to help you.
just be patient with me, shu lien.
lo?
jen!
you should not have come.
with all the traffic on your rooftop these days... it took me a while to get in here.  i can not wait any longer.  i was wrong to let you go.  come back with me.  you will be happy in the desert.  you will be free there.
let's stop a moment.
give it back!
you are tired.  you need rest.  your horse needs water.  there is a creek up here.
well, there used to be!  what is your name?  I am lo.  the hans call me dark cloud.  I am not that tall or big, but I am quick as lightning.
my comb!
you have got quite a temper.  it is better this way.
you coward!
still in a bad mood?  at least you are speaking.  what is your name?
no more hitting on the head!  all this trouble for a comb?
it is mine.  it means a lot to me. a barbarian like you would not understand.
not true.  i can use it to pick fleas from my horse.
by the way, I am a real manchurian.
I am sorry... i guessed wrong.  i though you were a han.
give me back my comb.
i do not take orders from anyone.
give it back.
when i was a boy, one night, i saw a thousand shooting stars.  i thought, where did they all go? I am an orphan.  i used to look for stars alone.  i thought if i rode to the other end of the desert, I would find them.  I have been riding in the desert ever since.
and so, the little boy became a fearsome bandit.  he could not find the stars, so he stole my comb.
out here, you always fight for survival.  you have to be part of a gang to stand a chance.  slowly, your gang becomes your family.  all that dark cloud stuff is just to scare people and make my life easier.
so you are still that little boy looking for shooting stars.
i am a man.  and now I have found the brightest star of all.
your father's men are still looking for you.  they are still out there, circling closer.
let them look.
it is trouble for me.
do not send me back!
you must decide.  you might get tired of this life.  you might begin to miss your family.  if it were our daughter, we would look for her too.  she would miss us.  jen... i want you to be mine forever.  i will make my mark on the world.  i will earn your parents' respect. we have a legend.  anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, god will grant his wish.  long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  he did not die.  he was not even hurt.  he floated away, far away, never to return.  he knew his wish had come true.  if you believe, it will happen.  the elders say, "a faithful heart makes wishes come true."
keep it safe.  return it to me when we are together again.
i will.
if you don't, I will come after you. and i will not let you off so easy.
go.
jen...
do not ever come back.
you think jade fox will show up?
she is out there, but i doubt she will show herself.  we will keep our eyes open.  sooner or later, she will come for the girl.
do not you want to see her again.
all right.  I will write you an introduction.  take it to wudan. wait there for news from me.
hello.  what is your name?
long.
in that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
do not bother.
you do not seem to understand.
so what if i don't?
are you related to li mu bai?
he is my defeated foe!
shu lien... the things we touch have no permanence.  my master would say... there is nothing we can hold on to in this world.  only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.
not everything is an illusion.  my hand... was not that real?
your hand, rough and callused from machete practice... all this time, I have never had the courage to touch it.
giang hu is a world of tigers and dragons, full of corruption... i tried sincerely to give it up but i have brought us only trouble.
to repress one's feelings only makes them stronger.
you are right, but i do not know what to do.  i want to be with you... just like this.  it gives me a sense of peace.
we are close to your headquarters. go home and check in.
what about you?
I will look around and catch up later.
not a bad idea.  tonight we will get a good night's sleep at headquarters.
you are back!
how is the arm?  still sore?
much better.  you have been gone so long.
li mu bai is coming to stay the night.
I will go and make up his room!
here you must be in proper attire.
I am just borrowing some clean clothes.  I am not staying.
I will give them to you.
i was just passing by and wondered how you were.
you, sister...
look at the trouble you have caused. now you know what giang hu life is really like.  if you think of me as your sister, let me give you some sisterly advice.  you can run from marriage, but not your parents.
they forced me to marry!
go back to them first.  then you can decide about lo.
you know about lo?
he really loves you.  come back to peking with me.  we will find a solution.
where is he now?
li mu bai has made arrangements. he sent him to wudan mountain.
you are working together to set me up!  I am leaving!
how dare you accuse us?  i always knew you had stolen the sword! I have done nothing but protect you and your family.  and you are repaid me with nothing but contempt.  li mu bai himself spared you, and all you do is insult him.  we wanted some peace and you have ruined it all! you are no sister of mine!
what do i care?  you were never a real friend anyway.  but i wonder, how long could you last as my enemy?
do not touch it!  that is li mu bai's sword.
come and get it if you can.
without the green destiny, you are nothing.
do not be a sore loser.  go ahead. take your pick.  I will wait.  go ahead.
stop it!  you do not deserve the green destiny.
not another lecture!  on guard!
let's end this here.
only the sword will settle this.
what do you want?
what I have always wanted, to teach you.
all right.  if you can take back the sword in three moves, I will go with you.
give it back!
kneel!
never!
then you have no use for the sword.
she is crazy.  you should have killed her.
i did not have the heart.
well, li mu bai can do it.
what happened?
jade fox drugged her.  how did you get here?
we followed jade fox.
you can not die!  tell us what poison you used!  you can not die!  tell us the antidote!  you can not let li mu bai die!
she used purple yin... purple yin poison.  it goes straight to the heart.
my blood will soon reverse its flow. it is the same poison she used to kill my master.  there is no antidote.
that can not be!  everything has an antithesis!  why not this?
the antidote exists.  she taught it to me.  the formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare.  trust me. as you have helped me, let me help you.
all right.  hurry.  i will hold on as long as i can.
take my horse and go to the compound. give this to mrs. wu.  she will help you.  hurry!
spare your energy.  I will be back!
mu bai, hold on.  give me some hope...
shu lien...
save your strength.
my life is departing.  I have only one breath left.
use it to meditate.  free yourself from this world as you have been taught.  let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath.  do not waste it... for me.
I have already wasted my whole life. i want to tell you with my last breath... i have always loved you. i would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you.  because of your love... i will never be a lonely spirit.
do you remember the legend of the young man?
"a faithful heart makes wishes come true."
make a wish, lo.
