c'mon, dennis, this is stupid.  i thought we were going to go to the movies.
mars?!  whattaya think, dude?  out here on the edge, no one around, it is perfect, right?
try to act cool, okay?  he is going to think you are a dick.
robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
not if they do not catch us, kevin.
we got jobs, man; we are working.  why even take the chance?
because if you do not take the chance, you are already dead.
there is fuckin' blood all over you!
i did not know he would have a gun!  it just went off!
that woman's going to call the cops.
shut up, goddamnit!  just calm down!
what if he is dead?  what if you killed him?
that is why we got to keep going.  I am not going to go in for murder.
we are on foot.  we can not get away.
we are surrounded by houses, dumbass. every house has a car in the garage. all we have to do is take one.
who else is here?
my father.
jen?  are you all right?
she will be dead if you do not put your ass in that chair!
who sent you?
do not go rambo and you will tell'm about this on the back nine.  I am going to tie you up, then we are going to take your car.
the car.  all you want is the car?
am i talkin' raghead?!  i want your car! gimme the goddamned keys!
i need to work out some stuff.
you are hiding, jeffrey.  you are hiding from the job and you are hiding from me.
i still see that boy's eyes.
can we talk some more when you get here?
we will see you in a couple of hours.
what are you talking about, shot?  what happened?
three white males shot junior.  mike followed them to york estates --
where are they?
york estates.  four-five-five castle way. anders and jorgenson are on the way.
are civilians inside?
he said something about a girl --
holster your guns!
mike!  mike, can you hear me?
i think he is dead!
do not shout, larry.  I am three feet away.
we have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
what are we going to do about mike?
keep your head down.
one at a time!  clear the air!  louise?  talk to me.  what do we have?
junior kim was doa at the hospital.
chief?  mike said a young girl answered the door.
did he say if she was shooting at him?
he did not say.
then we do not know if she is part of this or not.  mickey, you up?
we are out two minutes, me and dreyer.
mike found a red pickup abandoned on flanders.  you see it?
it is right in front of us.
run a dmv on the plate for the owner's name.
i pulled mickey and dreyer off the minimart.
jesus christ, louise, we can not leave a crime scene like that.  put a unit out there.
we only have eight officers on duty, chief.
that is not enough.
what is that, chief?  say again.
get everyone out here.  then call the sheriffs.  tell them we have a possible hostage situation.
we could have gone out the back!  you did not have to shoot!
stop it!  they found the truck, kev! they are already behind us!
we should give up.  all we are doing is making it worse.
stay down!  stay down, goddamnit!
I am going to my desk.
you are not goin' anywhere!  get on the fuckin' floor!
get on the floor!
i have contacts in los angeles.  lawyers and judges who can help you.
mars, watch the cops!  kevin!  watch the back of the house!
you will not die if you let me help.
bullshit!
but if you stay in this house, i can promise you this --
shut up!  shut up and get on the floor!
you can not imagine the fucking you are going to get.
the house belongs to walter and pamela smith.  they have got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, jennifer and thomas.
that would be the girl who opened the door.  are the others inside?
the mother is in florida visiting her sister.  the father works at home, so he is probably inside.
louise?
go, chief.
get a phone number for the smiths.
chief, mikkelson.
go, mickey.
the truck is registered to dennis james rooney, white male, twenty-two.  he has an agua dulce address.
contact the landlord.  i want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
he needs a doctor.
shut up and sit down.  you think someone is going to make a house call?
please get away from me.
mars?  what are you doing?
want one?
i do not drink beer.
mommy will not know.  you can do anything you want right now.  mommy will not know.
what i want is to help my father.
you with the cops?
the bristo police department.  look out the window.  you see the car?
yeah.  I am rooney.
we had an awful lot of shooting.  you need a doctor in there?
we are cool.
let me speak to mr. smith.  i want to hear it from him.
fuck you.  I am running this shit.  you talk to me.
how about your two friends?  you do not have a man dying in there, do you?
they are fine.
all three subjects are confirmed inside. call off the house-to-house.  okay, dennis, i want to explain your situation --
you do not have to explain shit!  that chinaman pulled a gun.  we wrestled for it.  that chinaman shot himself.
mr. kim did not make it, dennis.  he died.
how about the cop?
dennis?  i want you to release those people.
fuck that.  they are the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
we are not coming in there by force, okay? no one wants to hurt you.
i got these people!  you try to come get me, I will kill every fuckin' one of them!
i have to tell you something --
we gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
it is about mars --
that cop did not pull his gun.  mars lied. he just started shooting!
bullshit.  why would mars do that?
i was there, dennis!  i saw!  it is like he wanted to shoot that cop.
you are being stupid.  check out the bathroom.  maybe we can sneak out a window --
jesus.  what is this?
are you totally stupid?  what does it look like?
i should have called.  this thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
do not worry about it.  how are you doing?
the sheriffs will take over when they get here.
but they are not here yet.  tell me about you.
why do not you guys grab some dinner at the thai place?  I will meet you there as soon as i can.
you sure?
i do not know how long I will be stuck here.
I am in no rush.  maybe later we can talk.
I am scared shitless.
that is okay.  i love you anyway.
worst case, it is a bloodbath.  the detectives come out with smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass go.
maybe glen already picked up the disks.
i took the call from glen personally. they are still in smith's house.
maybe we are getting too dramatic.  it is three kids.  they will give up, the cops will arrest them, and that is that.  why would they search the house?
you think we should take that chance?
i guess not.
i guess not, too.  how much information is in the house?
what, he is cute?  that is his idea of humor?
if the feds get those disks, the east coast is gonna take a hit, too.  you should let them know.
no way.  i tell them, that old man is gonna handle this from back there.
you should warn them, sonny.
fuck them!  now get your head in the game, phil--we have to handle this.
put our people on the scene.  smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
he knows better than that.
bullshit--a man will do anything to save his family.  who is running the show up there?
find out how we can hurt him.  by the end of the day, i want to own him.
it is happening right now.
l.a. county sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in pico rivera.
give me an eta.
an hour, tops.  might be sooner.
what if it goes south?
what do you mean?
if things get wet, we are going to need someone who can handle that end.
you worry about your end.  i got my side covered.
talley lives here.  i do not know if the place has security or not.
it will not be a problem.
he has a wife and kid.  that is how we will get to him.
okey-doke.
we have to own this guy, marion.  we do not want him dead; we need to use him.
donuts here any good?
i do not eat junk food.
can you identify this man?
that would be mars krupchek.  jesus, he works for me, too.
have louise run the name 'mars krupchek' through dmv and ncic.  tell her to list the tattoo as an identifier.
is krupchek an aggressive guy?  hot- tempered?  anything like that?
keeps to himself, more like.
you have his address?
pretty sure i do.  yeah, here we go --
call the palmdale city attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  when you get the warrant, have mikkelson and dreyer search his house.
yes, sir.
louise?
go, chief.
call jane for me.  she is at the little thai place.
i know the one.
tell her I am almost home.
it is a safety room.  if anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
who gives a shit, mars?  check out the cash!  we are rich.
we are trapped in a house.
we can take it with us.
you can not run with suitcases.
everyone knows what we look like, dennis. we will not be able to hide.
jesus, first mars, now you.  you two need anti-depressants.
my father needs a doctor.  please.
hey, I have got a situation here, in case you have not noticed.
all you are doing is watching yourself on tv.  look at him.
use more ice.
I am getting a doctor!
that is right.  that is a good idea, mars.
find something:  extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
find something, kevin.  do not just stand there.  and tie this bastard, too.  i do not want him waking up and goin' rambo on us.
you gotta pee?
i do not see why you can not just lock me in.  it is not like i can go anywhere.
either I am going to tie you or mars will tie you.  which do you want?
thanks for the shirt.
whatever.
kevin, my father needs a doctor.
he is just knocked out.  I have been knocked out.
if my father dies they will charge you with his murder.  can not you make dennis see that?
ow!  shit!
be quiet!  listen!
no one's coming.
that big asshole nailed my windows.
mine, too.
we can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  then we can run for it.
no!  I am not going to leave daddy with them!
we can not carry him.
you go, thomas.  you get out, and I will stay with daddy.
I am not going to leave you!
go!  if you get out, maybe you can help the police!
you leave that gun alone!
shh, they will hear you!
better than you getting killed!  do not touch that gun!  daddy says --
I am talley.  who is in charge?
laura martin.  this is will maddox, the primary negotiator --
do it.
do not crowd the house.  the alpha's a kid named rooney.  he is amped up and volatile.
sounds like you know the job.
I have done it once or twice.  i blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you will have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
maddox!  you got that?
someone should stay with mr. smith.  what if he wakes up?
that is why we tied him, dumbass.  now come here and see this --
these bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  all we need is some kind of diversion and we are home free.
that is crazy, dennis.  the cops will see us.
not if they are looking at something else.
like what?
we can not carry all this.  it is too heavy.
I have been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
the cops are comin'!
i got the gasoline --
we do not have time!
then get your men off the wall!  you breach that house, we are going to have a bloodbath!  i know this guy, captain -- i can talk to him.
order your men to stand down.
it is over now, dennis!  do not hurt anyone.
we will burn this fuckin' place down!  i got gasoline all over in here!
talley?
I am here.
i want a helicopter to take us to mexico.
that is not going to happen, dennis.  they will not give you a helicopter.
I will give you these people.
the mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  there is only one way out and you are doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  i think we could make the transition now. maddox, you good to go?
hey, dennis?  can i let you in on a personal secret?
what?
i gotta piss real bad.
you are a funny guy, talley.
I am going to put on an officer named will maddox.  you talk to him for a while.
he says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
jesus.  he must have siphoned it from the cars.
if you go in, you can not use tear gas or flashbangs.  the whole place would go up.
looks like you are bailing out at the right time.
that is why you get the big bucks, captain.
chief, base.
go.
i could not find jane.  she was not at the restaurant.
you have her cell number?
she did not answer.
they might be at the house.  keep trying and let me know.  I am going to be here a little while longer.
what the fuck is that?
they will cut the power.
what about my father?
aw, jesus, not more of this.
look at him!  i think he is dying!
take'm back upstairs, but do not tie'm like before.  that little fuck untied himself anyway.
did you find jane and mandy?
could you call me back on your phone? right away.
what is wrong with the radio?
other people can hear us.  just call. please.
stand by.
is something wrong with jane?
we have a boy on the line.  he says he is thomas smith and he is calling from the house.
it is a crank, louise.  c'mon, do not waste my time with that!
his cell number belongs to the smiths.  i think it is real, chief.  i think this boy is inside that house.
this is chief talley.  tell me your name, son.
thomas smith.  I am in the house that is on tv.  dennis hit my dad and now he will not wake up.  you got to help him.
slow down, thomas.  take it easy and talk to me.  was your father shot?
dennis hit him.  his head's all big and he will not wake up.  I am really scared.
how about you and your sister?
we are okay.
where are you right now?
in my room.
that is on the second floor.  could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
they nailed the windows.  i can not get'm open.
I have got the boy on the phone.  he is using a cell phone.  what was that, son?  i did not hear you.
if i try to climb out they will see me on the security cameras.  they would see you outside, too --
he says that his father's hurt.
if we have a man dying in there, we will have to go in.
they have security cameras.  rooney would see you coming.
did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
no.  he said that his father's unconscious; he did not say he was dying.
then i think we should wait.  do you agree?
you want me to stick around, i could --
you have been here all day, chief.  take a break.  see your family.  if i need you, I will call.
where is your gun?
I am the chief.  i do not carry it.
who are you?
follow the mustang.  we will not go far.
do not just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. do you understand?
what do you want?
these guys are going to take hold of you. do not freak out.  it is for your own good.
can we let go?  you past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you will not do something stupid?
you can let go.
marlon and al....
we want them.  you will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
i can not control what happens.  the sheriffs are running the scene.
you will re-assume command.  in two hours, a group of my people will arrive at york estates.  you will tell the sheriffs that they are an fbi tactical team.
when this phone rings, you answer.  it will be me.  I will tell you what to do. when i have what i want, you get your family.
you want . . . marlon and al.
i have people in york estates right under your nose.  if you do anything except what I am telling you, you will get jane and amanda back in the mail.  we clear on that?
these disks . . . where are they?
smith will know.
wow.  sure, right away, chief.
do not tell anyone what you are doing, not louise, not the other guys, not the sheriffs.  you understand me, larry?
i guess so.
fuck guessing.  you keep your mouth shut.
i will, chief.  absolutely.
get to work.
excuse me?  you requested our help.  you turned over command --
and now I am taking it back.  we are getting smith out of the house.
what do you want?
we can not make the microwave work.
what?
we are hungry.  you are going to cook.
make the pizza.  i want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
how about dog shit?
that you, talley?
the one and only.  we got a little problem out here, dennis.
you oughta try on the problem i got in here.
i need you to let me talk to mr. smith.
we been through that.  forget it.
we can not forget it.  the sheriffs think you will not let me talk to smith because he is dead.  they think you murdered him.
now i understand.  that helps.  i can make them understand that.
okay.
let me come get him.
fuck that!  you bastards will jump me!
if you will not let me come in, then put him outside.
you will cap my ass as soon as i step out the door!
you have already helped yourself once, dennis; be smart again.  if you save his life, it will help when you get to court.
I am the chief of police here.  i have to talk to him.
am not going to happen.  we have got unequal pupilation.  he could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
smith!  wake up!
what are you doing?!  stop that!
I am not going to wake him.  i do not even know that i can.
just one question.  please.
he.  can't.  answer.
talley.
it is me, chief.  can you talk?
what did you find out?
the cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in beverly hills.  the phone company shows no unusual --
dead end--it's a clone.  what about the mustang?
it was stolen.
you get anything on smith?
chief...it's like none of this exists. I am sorry.
keep trying.
i heard he is fucked up.  they are taking him to the hospital.
goddamnit, tell me what you know.  did the cops go in?  did smith have the disks?
i do not know.  talley talked those punks into letting smith out.  he is fucking us over, glen.  that guy is fucking us over.
what hospital?
canyon country.
is my daddy okay?
the doctors are taking care of him right now.  thomas . . . are you safe?  can you talk?
i think so.
i need your help with something.  but if you think those guys could catch you, then i do not want you to do it, okay?
okay.
I am serious, thomas; i do not want you to get hurt.
what do you want me to do?
your dad has two computer disks.  they have funny names:  marlon and al.
he has lots of disks.
i think he was working on them today, so they are probably in his office.  could you find them and see who they belong to?
dennis will not let me go to the desk.  he makes me sit on the floor.
but i might be able to sneak into the office if they are not around.  then i could open the disks here in my room.
i thought they locked you in your room.
i can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
can you get into the office?
i can get into the den.  the office is right across the hall.
if i get rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?
yes, sir.
i want to know what in hell you are doing.
I am looking for you.  i need your tactical unit.
I am not stupid!  you can not get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
do not question me, captain!  this is my crime scene!
-- then when you get him, you damn near assault the man in the ambulance!  what is going on?
we are fucked.
we are fucked until we think of a way out; then we are rich.
there is no way out.
for chrissake, please!  help me celebrate!  i figured it out!
celebrate what?  going to prison?
cops want to be rich like everyone else. all we have to do is share.  and if he wants someone to swing for the chinaman, we will give'm mars.
dennis.
you got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
only if you try to grab me.  we could have shot you from the wall.
you have been in there a long time. what are you waiting for?
would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
I would be trying to get the best deal that i could.
maybe that is what I am doing.  can i reach in my pocket, show you something?
you picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
give up.
there is a million dollars in there, maybe two million.  I will give you half.
it am not been a good day, chief.
give up, dennis.  let these people go. at least you will have your life.
can you open them?
i opened marlon.  i think it is somebody is taxes.
look for names.  does it say whose taxes they are?
i do not see any people names.  it is all businesses.
try al.  see if you can open al.
yeah!  here's a name.  this is somebody is personal tax --
who is it?
charles g. benza.  they are coming!
what is going on?
get in the car.  now.
where are my children?
they are still in the house.
I am jeff talley, the bristo chief of police.  so far as we know, your children are okay.
chief talley is the one who got you out.
i need to talk to him.  alone.
i do not know what you are talking about.
he is going to kill you.  do not you know that?  he can not take the chance that you will talk.
that is enough.
another minute.  please --
you dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up bad!
do you think I am going to let you murder someone?!
you want a blowtorch on your daughter's pretty face?!
I will go in that fuckin' house right now! I will give those disks to the real fbi, you cocksuckingmotherfucker!!  and I have got smith!  i've got smith!!
i guess we each have something the other wants.
i guess we do.
my people are good to go.  you know who i mean?
your phony fbi assholes.
we are almost home, you and me.  keep your shit together.  this is not l.a.
what do you mean by that?
you do not want another dead child on your conscience.
if we do not escape, we got to get the word out about the cash.  that is how we will stay alive.
what are you talking about?
the only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  he is got to cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  he is probably planning it right now.
that is crazy.  he is not going to kill us.
kevin, you are so fuckin' stupid...
it is over.  we have to give up.
fuck it is over.  that money's mine.
that money's fucked up your brain. talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we will all be fuckin' killed!
then we might as well die rich.
I am not going to die for this!
you got something to say?
i like it here, dennis.  I am never going to leave.
fuckin' a.
what do you want?
keep your voice down.  I am taking you and your brother out of here.
what happened?
do you want to go or not?  I am offering you a way out of here.
i can not go without thomas.
all three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  mars and dennis do not know I am doing this.
how can we get out?
dennis and mars are in the den.  I will get your brother, then come back for you. we will go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
yes.
okay, here's mine.  my name is special agent jones.
are all of you named jones?
do not be funny, chief.  you can not afford it.
in a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  so let's get our shit straight before that happens.
you used to be a cop.  all of you used to be cops.  i can tell by the way you move.
do not worry about what we used to be.
how do you people expect this to work? the sheriffs have a crisis response team here.
what is my name?
what?
i asked you my name.  you just saw my commission slip.  what is my fucking name?
special agent jones.
think of me that way and you will not fuck up.  I will handle the sheriffs.
what are you people going to do?
you and i are going to straighten this out with the sheriffs, and then we will wait for the man to call.  when he gives the word, we move.
what does he have on you?  i know why I am doing this, but what does he have on you?
let it go, captain.
goddamned small town bullshit.
it is mine.  talley.
chief, it is mikkelson.
go, mickey.
mickey?  call the state homicide bureau. do not touch anything, just sit back and wait.
yes, sir.
you mean he left, as in went out the front door?
i overheard him with the girl.
shit!  that fuck!  even when i want to turn myself in he screws it up!  did he take the kids with him?
i do not know.
jesus, get upstairs and find out!  if he took those kids, we are fucked!
kevin left without you.
i do not know what you are talking about.
you would better get out of here!  kevin's coming back!
kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
now we can do whatever we want.
stop it.
he can not reach us in here.  we are safe.
i know.
we have got to get those kids out of there!
not until the man calls.
those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  he kills people!
they have been in there all day.
the kids are in here!
where is the office?
help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks later!
are the disks still in your room?
no!  they are right here --
did you find the disks?
yes.
then you have everything.  you can put them away.
a man has my family.  gold watch here. dark tan.
that would be glen howell.  he was on his way for the disks.
how do i reach him?
how did you get this number?
mr. jones is dead.  so are two of his men.  the other three are in jail.  i have the disks.  i have walter smith. and you know what, you motherfucker?  i have you.
i have your fucking family.  do not forget that.
i also have a couple of million in cash. call sonny benza.  ask if i can keep it.
what do you want?
my wife and my daughter and the money. I will bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  we will trade.
fuck that!  you think I am crazy?!
i think you got no choice.
fuck the mall.  you know that motel on the road west of town?
yeah.
you got ten minutes.  if you are one minute late, we will not be here to find.
the house is in flames, benza's accountant is with the cops, and they are stacking the bodies like cordwood.
jesus christ, it is a clusterfuck.
you wanted to let sonny handle it.  i would have moved in when we first found out.
and by doing so, he would have known we have spies in his organization.
yes, sir.  but what about the disks?  if the cops end up with the disks, we are going to see a whole lot of heat.
i hate that mickey mouse bastard.  i hated his father, and i hate sonny, too. always with the tan.
what do you want to do?
our people out there, they good people? people in the right place?
the best.
sonny's a fuckup.  if he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  but if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
i understand.
i want a message sent:  no fuckups allowed.
I will make the call.
take it easy.  just take it easy.  we are here to do business.
you said they would be here, goddamnit! where are they?
they are close.  let me make a call.  you can see they are okay.
you said they would be here!
you get the other one when i have my girls.  not talk to them; have them.
where is it?
close.
all right.  now the second one.
first my girls.  i get my girls, you get the other disk.
I will kill you!  you will not get the other disk!
if you shoot me, he will kill your daughter.  do you want to lose both of them?
i gave the other one to the sheriffs and they are giving it to the real fbi.  this one's a fake.
you would better be kidding.
are you out of your mind?
you fucked up, glen.
