c'mon, dennis, this is stupid.  i thought we were gonna go to the movies.
mars?!  whattaya think, dude?  out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
try to act cool, okay?  he's gonna think you're a dick.
robbing this place is gonna put you back in prison.
not if they don't catch us, kevin.
we got jobs, man; we're working.  why even take the chance?
because if you don't take the chance, you're already dead.
there's fuckin' blood all over you!
i didn't know he would have a gun!  it just went off!
that woman's gonna call the cops.
shut up, goddamnit!  just calm down!
what if he's dead?  what if you killed him?
that's why we gotta keep going.  i'm not gonna go in for murder.
we're on foot.  we can't get away.
we're surrounded by houses, dumbass. every house has a car in the garage. all we have to do is take one.
who else is here?
my father.
jen?  are you all right?
she'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!
who sent you?
don't go rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  i'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.
the car.  all you want is the car?
am i talkin' raghead?!  i want your car! <u>gimme the goddamned keys</u>!
i need to work out some stuff.
you're hiding, jeffrey.  you're hiding from the job and you're hiding from me.
i still see that boy's eyes.
can we talk some more when you get here?
we'll see you in a couple of hours.
what are you talking about, shot?  what happened?
three white males shot junior.  mike followed them to york estates --
where are they?
york estates.  four-five-five castle way. anders and jorgenson are on the way.
are civilians inside?
he said something about a girl --
holster your guns!
mike!  mike, can you hear me?
i think he's dead!
don't shout, larry.  i'm three feet away.
we have to cordon off the streets, then evacuate these houses.
what are we going to do about mike?
keep your head down.
one at a time!  clear the air!  louise?  talk to me.  what do we have?
junior kim was doa at the hospital.
chief?  mike said a young girl answered the door.
did he say if she was shooting at him?
he didn't say.
then we don't know if she's part of this or not.  mickey, you up?
we're out two minutes, me and dreyer.
mike found a red pickup abandoned on flanders.  you see it?
it's right in front of us.
run a dmv on the plate for the owner's name.
i pulled mickey and dreyer off the minimart.
jesus christ, louise, we can't leave a crime scene like that.  put a unit out there.
we only have eight officers on duty, chief.
that's not enough.
what's that, chief?  say again.
get everyone out here.  then call the sheriffs.  tell them we have a possible hostage situation.
we could've gone out the back!  you didn't have to shoot!
stop it!  they found the truck, kev! they're already behind us!
we should give up.  all we're doing is making it worse.
stay down!  stay <u>down</u>, goddamnit!
i'm going to my desk.
you're not goin' anywhere!  get on the fuckin' floor!
<u>get on the floor</u>!
i have contacts in los angeles.  lawyers and judges who can help you.
mars, watch the cops!  kevin!  watch the back of the house!
you won't die if you let me help.
bullshit!
but if you stay in this house, i can promise you this --
<u>shut up!  shut up and get on the floor</u>!
you can't imagine the fucking you're going to get.
the house belongs to walter and pamela smith.  they've got two kids, a girl about fifteen and a boy younger, jennifer and thomas.
that would be the girl who opened the door.  are the others inside?
the mother is in florida visiting her sister.  the father works at home, so he's probably inside.
louise?
go, chief.
get a phone number for the smiths.
chief, mikkelson.
go, mickey.
the truck is registered to dennis james rooney, white male, twenty-two.  he has an agua dulce address.
contact the landlord.  i want to know employment, friends, family, anything we can find out about this guy.
he needs a doctor.
shut up and sit down.  you think someone's gonna make a house call?
please get away from me.
mars?  what are you doing?
want one?
i don't drink beer.
mommy won't know.  you can do anything you want right now.  mommy won't know.
what i want is to help my father.
you with the cops?
the bristo police department.  look out the window.  you see the car?
yeah.  i'm rooney.
we had an awful lot of shooting.  you need a doctor in there?
we're cool.
let me speak to mr. smith.  i want to hear it from him.
fuck you.  i'm running this shit.  you talk to me.
how about your two friends?  you don't have a man dying in there, do you?
they're fine.
all three subjects are confirmed inside. call off the house-to-house.  okay, dennis, i want to explain your situation --
you don't have to explain shit!  that chinaman pulled a gun.  we wrestled for it.  that chinaman shot himself.
mr. kim didn't make it, dennis.  he died.
how about the cop?
dennis?  i want you to release those people.
fuck that.  they're the only thing stopping you from blowing us away.
we're not coming in there by force, okay? no one wants to hurt you.
i got these people!  you try to come get me, i'll kill every fuckin' one of them!
i have to tell you something --
we gotta find a way outta here is what we gotta do!
it's about mars --
that cop didn't pull his gun.  mars lied. he just started shooting!
bullshit.  why would mars do that?
i was <u>there</u>, dennis!  i <u>saw</u>!  it's like he <u>wanted</u> to shoot that cop.
you're being stupid.  check out the bathroom.  maybe we can sneak out a window --
jesus.  what is this?
are you totally stupid?  what does it look like?
i should've called.  this thing broke right after we spoke, then everything happened so fast --
don't worry about it.  how are you doing?
the sheriffs will take over when they get here.
but they're not here yet.  tell me about <u>you</u>.
why don't you guys grab some dinner at the thai place?  i'll meet you there as soon as i can.
you sure?
i don't know how long i'll be stuck here.
i'm in no rush.  maybe later we can talk.
i'm scared shitless.
that's okay.  i love you anyway.
worst case, it's a bloodbath.  the detectives come out with smith's computer, and we go directly to jail, do not pass go.
maybe glen already picked up the disks.
i took the call from glen personally. they're still in smith's house.
maybe we're getting too dramatic.  it's three kids.  they'll give up, the cops will arrest them, and that's that.  why would they search the house?
you think we should take that chance?
i guess not.
i guess not, too.  how much information is in the house?
what, he's cute?  that's his idea of humor?
if the feds get those disks, the east coast is gonna take a hit, too.  you should let them know.
no way.  i tell them, that old man is gonna handle this from back there.
you should warn them, sonny.
<u>fuck</u> them!  now get your head in the game, phil--we have to handle this.
put our people on the scene.  smith might talk just to cut a break for his kids.
he knows better than that.
bullshit--a man will do anything to save his family.  who's running the show up there?
find out how we can hurt him.  by the end of the day, i want to own him.
it's happening right now.
l.a. county sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in pico rivera.
give me an eta.
an hour, tops.  might be sooner.
what if it goes south?
what do you mean?
if things get wet, we're going to need someone who can handle that end.
you worry about your end.  i got my side covered.
talley lives here.  i don't know if the place has security or not.
it won't be a problem.
he has a wife and kid.  that's how we'll get to him.
okey-doke.
we have to own this guy, marion.  we don't want him dead; we need to use him.
donuts here any good?
i don't eat junk food.
can you identify this man?
that would be mars krupchek.  jesus, he works for me, too.
have louise run the name 'mars krupchek' through dmv and ncic.  tell her to list the tattoo as an identifier.
is krupchek an aggressive guy?  hot- tempered?  anything like that?
keeps to himself, more like.
you have his address?
pretty sure i do.  yeah, here we go --
call the palmdale city attorney for a telephonic search warrant.  when you get the warrant, have mikkelson and dreyer search his house.
yes, sir.
louise?
go, chief.
call jane for me.  she's at the little thai place.
i know the one.
tell her i'm almost home.
it's a safety room.  if anyone breaks into your house, you can hide.
who gives a shit, mars?  check out the cash!  we're rich.
we're trapped in a house.
we can take it with us.
you can't run with suitcases.
everyone knows what we look like, dennis. we won't be able to hide.
jesus, first mars, now you.  you two need anti-depressants.
my father needs a doctor.  <u>please</u>.
hey, i've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
all you're doing is watching yourself on tv.  <u>look</u> at him.
use more ice.
i'm getting a doctor!
that's right.  that's a good idea, mars.
find something:  extension cords, rope, wire--we'll have to tie them tight.
find something, kevin.  don't just stand there.  and tie this bastard, too.  i don't want him waking up and goin' rambo on us.
you gotta pee?
i don't see why you can't just lock me in.  it's not like i can go anywhere.
either i'm going to tie you or mars will tie you.  which do you want?
thanks for the shirt.
whatever.
kevin, my father needs a doctor.
he's just knocked out.  i've been knocked out.
if my father dies they'll charge you with his murder.  can't you make dennis see that?
ow!  shit!
be quiet!  listen!
no one's coming.
that big asshole nailed my windows.
mine, too.
we can use the crawlspace to get downstairs.  then we can run for it.
no!  i'm not going to leave daddy with them!
we can't carry him.
you go, thomas.  you get out, and i'll stay with daddy.
i'm not gonna leave you!
go!  if you get out, maybe you can help the police!
you leave that gun alone!
shh, they'll hear you!
better than you getting killed!  don't touch that gun!  daddy says --
i'm talley.  who's in charge?
laura martin.  this is will maddox, the primary negotiator --
do it.
don't crowd the house.  the alpha's a kid named rooney.  he's amped up and volatile.
sounds like you know the job.
i've done it once or twice.  i blocked their phones to incoming calls, so you'll have to cut in a hard line to talk to him.
maddox!  you got that?
someone should stay with mr. smith.  what if he wakes up?
that's why we tied him, dumbass.  now come here and see this --
these bushes follow the wall into the neighbor's yard.  all we need is some kind of diversion and we're home free.
that's crazy, dennis.  the cops will see us.
not if they're looking at something else.
like what?
we can't carry all this.  it's too heavy.
i've been carrying you our whole fuckin' lives.
the cops are comin'!
i got the gasoline --
we don't have time!
then get your men off the wall!  you breach that house, we're gonna have a bloodbath!  i <u>know</u> this guy, captain -- i can talk to him.
order your men to stand down.
it's over now, dennis!  don't hurt anyone.
we'll burn this fuckin' place down!  i got gasoline all over in here!
talley?
i'm here.
i want a helicopter to take us to mexico.
that's not going to happen, dennis.  they won't give you a helicopter.
i'll give you these people.
the mexican police would arrest you as soon as it landed.  there's only one way out and you're doing it right now--just keep talking to us.  i think we could make the transition now. maddox, you good to go?
hey, dennis?  can i let you in on a personal secret?
what?
i gotta piss real bad.
you're a funny guy, talley.
i'm going to put on an officer named will maddox.  you talk to him for a while.
he says he has gasoline set to burn the place.
jesus.  he must've siphoned it from the cars.
if you go in, you can't use tear gas or flashbangs.  the whole place would go up.
looks like you're bailing out at the right time.
that's why you get the big bucks, captain.
chief, base.
go.
i couldn't find jane.  she wasn't at the restaurant.
you have her cell number?
she didn't answer.
they might be at the house.  keep trying and let me know.  i'm going to be here a little while longer.
what the fuck is that?
they'll cut the power.
what about my father?
aw, jesus, not more of this.
<u>look</u> at him!  i think he's dying!
take'm back upstairs, but don't tie'm like before.  that little fuck untied himself anyway.
did you find jane and mandy?
could you call me back on your phone? right away.
what's wrong with the radio?
other people can hear us.  just call. <u>please</u>.
stand by.
is something wrong with jane?
we have a boy on the line.  he says he's thomas smith and he's calling from the house.
it's a crank, louise.  c'mon, don't waste my time with that!
his cell number belongs to the smiths.  i think it's real, chief.  i think this boy is inside that house.
this is chief talley.  tell me your name, son.
thomas smith.  i'm in the house that's on tv.  dennis hit my dad and now he won't wake up.  you gotta help him.
slow down, thomas.  take it easy and talk to me.  was your father shot?
dennis hit him.  his head's all big and he won't wake up.  i'm really scared.
how about you and your sister?
we're okay.
where are you right now?
in my room.
that's on the second floor.  could you climb out your window if we were downstairs to catch you?
they nailed the windows.  i can't get'm open.
i've got the boy on the phone.  he's using a cell phone.  what was that, son?  i didn't hear you.
if i try to climb out they'll see me on the security cameras.  they would see you outside, too --
he says that his father's hurt.
if we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
they have security cameras.  rooney would see you coming.
did the boy say that any of them are in immediate danger?
no.  he said that his father's unconscious; he didn't say he was dying.
then i think we should wait.  do you agree?
you want me to stick around, i could --
you've been here all day, chief.  take a break.  see your family.  if i need you, i'll call.
where's your gun?
i'm the chief.  i don't carry it.
who are you?
follow the mustang.  we won't go far.
don't just fuckin' sit there, dumbass. do you understand?
what do you want?
these guys are going to take hold of you. don't freak out.  it's for your own good.
can we let go?  you past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
you can let go.
marlon and al....
we want them.  you will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
i can't control what happens.  the sheriffs are running the scene.
you will re-assume command.  in two hours, a group of my people will arrive at york estates.  you will tell the sheriffs that they are an fbi tactical team.
when this phone rings, you answer.  it will be me.  i'll tell you what to do. when i have what i want, you get your family.
you want . . . marlon and al.
i have people in york estates right under your nose.  if you do <u>anything</u> except what i'm telling you, you'll get jane and amanda back in the mail.  we clear on that?
these disks . . . where are they?
smith will know.
wow.  sure, right away, chief.
don't tell anyone what you're doing, not louise, not the other guys, not the sheriffs.  you understand me, larry?
i guess so.
fuck guessing.  you keep your mouth shut.
i will, chief.  absolutely.
get to work.
excuse me?  <u>you</u> requested our help.  you turned over command --
and now i'm taking it back.  we're getting smith out of the house.
what do you want?
we can't make the microwave work.
what?
we're hungry.  you're going to cook.
make the pizza.  i want scrambled eggs and hot dogs on mine.
how about dog shit?
that you, talley?
the one and only.  we got a little problem out here, dennis.
you oughta try on the problem i got in here.
i need you to let me talk to mr. smith.
we been through that.  forget it.
we can't forget it.  the sheriffs think you won't let me talk to smith because he's dead.  they think you murdered him.
now i understand.  that helps.  i can make them understand that.
okay.
let me come get him.
fuck that!  you bastards will jump me!
if you won't let me come in, then put him outside.
you'll cap my ass as soon as i step out the door!
you've already helped yourself once, dennis; be smart again.  if you save his life, it'll help when you get to court.
i'm the chief of police here.  i have to talk to him.
ain't gonna happen.  we've got unequal pupilation.  he could have an intracranial hematoma or a fracture or both.
smith!  wake up!
what are you doing?!  stop that!
i'm not going to wake him.  i don't even know that i can.
just one question.  please.
he.  can't.  answer.
talley.
it's me, chief.  can you talk?
what'd you find out?
the cell phone is registered to a jewelry store in beverly hills.  the phone company shows no unusual --
dead end--it's a clone.  what about the mustang?
it was stolen.
you get anything on smith?
chief...it's like none of this exists. i'm sorry.
keep trying.
i heard he's fucked up.  they're taking him to the hospital.
goddamnit, tell me what you <u>know</u>.  did the cops go in?  did smith have the disks?
<u>i don't know</u>.  talley talked those punks into letting smith out.  he's fucking us over, glen.  that guy is fucking us over.
what hospital?
canyon country.
is my daddy okay?
the doctors are taking care of him right now.  thomas . . . are you safe?  can you talk?
i think so.
i need your help with something.  but if you think those guys could catch you, then i don't want you to do it, okay?
okay.
i'm serious, thomas; i don't want you to get hurt.
what do you want me to do?
your dad has two computer disks.  they have funny names:  marlon and al.
he has lots of disks.
i think he was working on them today, so they're probably in his office.  could you find them and see who they belong to?
dennis won't let me go to the desk.  he makes me sit on the floor.
but i might be able to sneak into the office if they're not around.  then i could open the disks here in my room.
i thought they locked you in your room.
i can get into the crawlspace from my closet and climb all over the house.
can you get into the office?
i can get into the den.  the office is right across the hall.
if i get rooney into the back of the house, can you find the disks without being caught?
yes, sir.
i want to know what in hell you're doing.
i'm looking for you.  i need your tactical unit.
i'm not stupid!  you can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
don't question me, captain!  this is <u>my</u> crime scene!
-- then when you get him, you damn near assault the man in the ambulance!  <u>what</u> <u>is going on</u>?
we're fucked.
we're fucked until we think of a way out; then we're rich.
there is no way out.
for chrissake, <u>please</u>!  help me celebrate!  i figured it out!
celebrate what?  going to prison?
cops want to be rich like everyone else. all we have to do is share.  and if he wants someone to swing for the chinaman, we'll give'm mars.
dennis.
you got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?
only if you try to grab me.  we could've shot you from the wall.
you've been in there a long time. what're you waiting for?
would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
i'd be trying to get the best deal that i could.
maybe that's what i'm doing.  can i reach in my pocket, show you something?
you picked a bad house to hole up in, son.
two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.
give up.
there's a million dollars in there, maybe <u>two</u> million.  i'll give you half.
it ain't been a good day, chief.
give up, dennis.  let these people go. at least you'll have your life.
can you open them?
i opened marlon.  i think it's somebody's taxes.
look for names.  does it say whose taxes they are?
i don't see any people names.  it's all businesses.
try al.  see if you can open al.
yeah!  here's a name.  this is somebody's personal tax --
who is it?
charles g. benza.  they're coming!
what's going on?
get in the car.  <u>now</u>.
where are my children?
they're still in the house.
i'm jeff talley, the bristo chief of police.  so far as we know, your children are okay.
chief talley is the one who got you out.
i need to talk to him.  alone.
i don't know what you're talking about.
he's going to kill you.  don't you know that?  he can't take the chance that you'll talk.
that's enough.
another minute.  please --
you dumb fuckwad cop, you fucked up <u>bad</u>!
do you think i'm going to let you <u>murder</u> someone?!
<u>you want a blowtorch on your daughter's</u> <u>pretty face</u>?!
i'll go in that fuckin' house right now! i'll give those disks to the <u>real</u> fbi, you cocksuckingmotherfucker!!  and i've got <u>smith</u>!  <u>i've got smith</u>!!
i guess we each have something the other wants.
i guess we do.
my people are good to go.  you know who i mean?
your phony fbi assholes.
we're almost home, you and me.  keep your shit together.  this isn't l.a.
what do you mean by that?
you don't want another dead child on your conscience.
if we don't escape, we gotta get the word out about the cash.  that's how we'll stay alive.
what are you talking about?
the only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  he's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  he's probably planning it right now.
that's crazy.  he's not going to kill us.
kevin, you're so fuckin' stupid...
it's over.  we have to give up.
fuck it's over.  that money's mine.
that money's fucked up your brain. talley's going to get tired of waiting for us to give up, and we'll all be fuckin' killed!
then we might as well die rich.
i'm not going to die for this!
you got something to say?
i like it here, dennis.  i'm never going to leave.
fuckin' a.
what do you want?
keep your voice down.  i'm taking you and your brother out of here.
what happened?
do you want to go or not?  i'm offering you a way out of here.
i can't go without thomas.
all three of us will go, but we have to move fast.  mars and dennis don't know i'm doing this.
how can we get out?
dennis and mars are in the den.  i'll get your brother, then come back for you. we'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
yes.
okay, here's mine.  my name is special agent jones.
are all of you named jones?
don't be funny, chief.  you can't afford it.
in a few minutes the white phone is going to ring.  so let's get our shit straight before that happens.
you used to be a cop.  all of you used to be cops.  i can tell by the way you move.
don't worry about what we used to be.
how do you people expect this to work? the sheriffs have a crisis response team here.
what's my name?
what?
i asked you my name.  you just saw my commission slip.  what's my fucking name?
special agent jones.
think of me that way and you won't fuck up.  i'll handle the sheriffs.
what are you people going to do?
you and i are gonna straighten this out with the sheriffs, and then we'll wait for the man to call.  when he gives the word, we move.
what does he have on you?  i know why i'm doing this, but what does he have on you?
let it go, captain.
goddamned small town bullshit.
it's mine.  talley.
chief, it's mikkelson.
go, mickey.
mickey?  call the state homicide bureau. don't touch anything, just sit back and wait.
yes, sir.
you mean he <u>left</u>, as in went out the front door?
i overheard him with the girl.
<u>shit</u>!  that <u>fuck</u>!  even when i want to turn myself in he screws it up!  did he take the kids with him?
i don't know.
jesus, get upstairs and find out!  if he took those kids, we're fucked!
kevin left without you.
i don't know what you're talking about.
you'd better get out of here!  kevin's coming back!
kevin's gone, your daddy's gone, everybody's gone.
now we can do whatever we want.
stop it.
he can't reach us in here.  we're safe.
i know.
we've got to get those kids out of there!
not until the man calls.
those kids are in there with a fucking psychopath!  he <u>kills</u> people!
they've been in there all day.
the kids are in here!
where's the office?
help me, goddamnit, we can get the disks later!
are the disks still in your room?
no!  they're right here --
did you find the disks?
yes.
then you have everything.  you can put them away.
a man has my family.  gold watch here. dark tan.
that would be glen howell.  he was on his way for the disks.
how do i reach him?
how did you get this number?
mr. jones is dead.  so are two of his men.  the other three are in jail.  i have the disks.  i have walter smith. and you know what, you motherfucker?  i have you.
i have your fucking family.  don't forget that.
i also have a couple of million in cash. call sonny benza.  ask if i can keep it.
what do you want?
my wife and my daughter and the money. i'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  we'll trade.
fuck that!  you think i'm crazy?!
i think you got no choice.
fuck the mall.  you know that motel on the road west of town?
yeah.
you got ten minutes.  if you're one minute late, we won't be here to find.
the house is in flames, benza's accountant is with the cops, and they're stacking the bodies like cordwood.
jesus christ, it's a clusterfuck.
you wanted to let sonny handle it.  i would've moved in when we first found out.
and by doing so, he would've known we have spies in his organization.
yes, sir.  but what about the disks?  if the cops end up with the disks, we're gonna see a whole lot of heat.
i hate that mickey mouse bastard.  i hated his father, and i hate sonny, too. always with the tan.
what do you want to do?
our people out there, they good people? people in the right place?
the best.
sonny's a fuckup.  if he pulls this off, fine--life goes on.  but if the cops end up with those disks, we cut our losses.
i understand.
i want a message sent:  no fuckups allowed.
i'll make the call.
take it easy.  just take it easy.  we're here to do business.
you said they would be here, goddamnit! where are they?
they're close.  let me make a call.  you can see they're okay.
you said they would be here!
you get the other one when i have my girls.  not <u>talk</u> to them; <u>have</u> them.
where is it?
close.
all right.  now the second one.
first my girls.  i get my girls, you get the other disk.
i'll kill you!  you won't get the other disk!
if you shoot me, he'll kill your daughter.  do you want to lose both of them?
i gave the other one to the sheriffs and they're giving it to the <u>real</u> fbi.  this one's a fake.
you'd better be kidding.
are you out of your mind?
you fucked up, glen.
