she is just no good.
what can i tell you, kid? you are right. when you are right, you are right, and you are right.
am not worth thinking about.
you are absolutely right, i would not give her another thought.
you know, you are okay, mr. gittes. i know it is your job, but you are okay.
thanks, curly. call me jake.
thanks. you know something, jake?
what is that, curly?
i think I will kill her.
they do not kill a guy for that.
oh they don't?
not for your wife. that is the unwritten law.
...no...
you bet your ass you don't. you can not even pay me off.
I will pay the rest next trip. we only caught sixty ton of skipjack around san benedict. we hit a chubasco, they do not pay you for skipjack the way they do for tuna or albacore.
forget it. i only mention it to illustrate a point...
what kind of guy do you think i am?
thanks, mr. gittes.
call me jake. careful driving home, curly.
how do you do, mrs. mulwray?
mr. gittes...
now, mrs. mulwray, what seems to be the problem?
no, really?
I am afraid so.
i am sorry.
can not we talk about this alone, mr. gittes?
I am afraid not, mrs. mulwray. these men are my operatives and at some point they are going to assist me. i can not do everything myself.
of course not.
now, what makes you certain he is involved with someone?
mrs. mulwray, do you love your husband?
...yes of course.
then go home and forget about it.
but...
I am sure he loves you, too. you know the expression, let sleeping dogs lie? you are better off not knowing.
but i have to know.
all right, what is your husband's first name?
hollis. hollis mulwray.
water and power?
this type of investigation can be hard on your pocketbook, mrs. mulwray. it takes time.
money does not matter to me, mr. gittes.
walsh here?
he is in the dark room.
where did he go yesterday?
three reservoirs. men's room of a richfield gas station on flower, and the pig 'n whistle.
jesus christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
what did you expect? that is his job.
listen, we can not string this broad out indefinitely we got to come up with something.
i think i got something.
oh yeah? you pick up the watch?
it is on your desk. say, you hear the one about the guy who goes to the north pole with admiral byrd looking for penguins?
this?
they got into a terrific argument outside the pig 'n whistle.
what about?
i do not know. the traffic was pretty loud. i only heard one thing  apple core.
apple core?
yeah.
jesus christ, walsh. that is what you spent your day doing?
look, you tell me to take pictures, i take pictures.
let me explain something to you, walsh. this business requires a certain finesse.
look at that.
heat's murder.
what is that, pal?
nothing. you got a hell of a way to make a living.
oh? what do you do to make ends meet?
mortgage department, first national bank.
tell me, how many people a week do you foreclose on?
we do not publish a record in the paper, i can tell you that.
neither do i.
no, you have a press agent do it.
barney, who is this bimbo? he a regular customer?
take it easy, jake.
look, pal. i make an honest living. people do not come to me unless they are miserable and i help 'em out of a bad situation. i do not kick them out of their homes like you jerks who work in the bank.
jake, for christ's sake.
i do not know how that got in the paper as a matter of fact  it surprised me it was so quick. i make an honest living.
'course you do, jake.
an honest living.
so anyway, he says, 'whyn't you do what the chinese do?'
sophie, go to the little girl's room for a minute.
but, mr. gittes.
sophie.
yes, mr. gittes.
so there is this fella who is tired of screwing his wife.
jake, listen.
shut up, duffy, you are always in a hurry and his friend says why not do what the chinese do? so he says what do they do? his friend says the chinese they screw for a while. just listen a second, duffy...
mr. gittes?
yes?
do you know me?
well... i think i... i would have remembered.
have we ever met?
well, no.
never?
never.
that is what i thought. you see, I am mrs. evelyn mulwray. you know, mr. mulwray's wife.
not that mulwray?
yes, that mulwray, mr. gittes. and since you agree with me we have never met, you must also agree that i have not hired you to do anything. certainly not spy on my husband. i see you like publicity, mr. gittes. well, you are going to get it.
now wait a minute, mrs. mulwray...
there is seven ashtrays in this room, duffy.
okay.
that is a filthy habit.
i said okay, jake.
yeah, yeah. if she would come in here saying she was shirley temple you would say okay to that, too.
look, jake. she gave us mulwray's real phone number and address.
all she needed for that was the phone book!
no, no. she said not to call, her husband might answer.
when i find out who that phony bitch was.
sophie.
yes, mr. gittes.
get me the times. whitey mehrholtz.  and how about that snotty broad?  what does she think, she is perfect? coming in waving her lawyers and her money at me  so goddam smug. she is no better than anybody else in this town.
so he says you sent them?
they are all a bunch of phonies.
mr. mulwray, please.
he is not in, mr.?
gittes.
may i ask what this is regarding?
it is personal. has he been out long?
since lunch.
gee whiz.  and I am late.
he was expecting you?
fifteen minutes ago. why do not i go in and wait?
can i help you?  russ yelburton, deputy chief in the department.
j.j. gittes. and it is not a departmental matter.
i wonder if you would care to wait in my office?
after all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. well either he is the kind who chases after women or he isn't.
and mulwray isn't?
he never even kids about it.
maybe he takes it very seriously.
you do not happen to know where mr. mulwray's having lunch?
I am sorry, i --
well, tell him I will be back.
mind if i take one of your cards? in case i want to get in touch with you again.
help yourself.
relax, mulvihill, glad to see you.  do you know claude mulvihill here?
hope so. he is working for us.
would you like something to drink?
what are you having?
iced tea.
yeah. fine, thank you.
my husband's at the office.
actually he is not. and he is moved from his apartment at the el macando.
that is not his apartment.
anyway... i... the point is, mrs. mulwray.  I am not in business to be loved, but i am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. l.a.'s a small town, people talk.
I am just trying to make a living, and i do not want to become a local joke.
mr. gittes, you have talked me into it. I will drop the lawsuit.
what?
i said I will drop it.
so let's just drop the whole thing. sugar?  lemon?
mrs. mulwray?
yes, mr. gittes?
i do not want to drop it.
i should talk this over with your husband.
why?... what on earth for?  look, hollis seems to think you are an innocent man.
well, I have been accused of many things, mrs. mulwray, but never that.
you see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and i want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. I am not the one who is supposed to be caught with my pants down... so I would like to see your husband. unless that is a problem.
what do you mean?
may i speak frankly, mrs. mulwray?
you may if you can, mr. gittes.
well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course.  she is disappeared. maybe they disappeared together somewhere.
suppose they did. how does it concern you?
nothing personal, mrs. mulwray, i just --
it is very personal. it could not be more personal. is this a business or an obsession with you?
look at it this way. now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she is you, she is hired me. whoever put her up to it, did not have anything against me. they were out to get your husband. now if i see him, i can help him.  did you talk this morning?
no. i went riding rather early.
looks like you went quite a distance.
no, just riding bareback, that is all. anyway, you might try the oak pass or stone canyon reservoirs. sometimes at lunch hollis takes walks around them. otherwise he will be home by 6:30.
I will stop by.
please call first.
hello, jake.
how are you, lou?
i have a cold i can not seem to shake but other than that, I am fine.
summer colds are the worst.
yeah, they are.
thanks, lou.
how did you get past the guards?
well, to tell you the truth, i lied a little.
you have done well by yourself.
i get by.
well, sometimes it takes a while for a man to find himself and i guess you have.
you are behind the times, jake. they have got steam irons now.  and I am out of chinatown.
since when?
since i made lieutenant.
congratulations.
uh-huh. so what are you doing here?
looking for someone.
who?
hollis mulwray. you seen him?
oh yes.
I would like to talk to him.
you are welcome to try. there he is.
it looks like he was washed the entire length of the runoff channel. could he swim?
of course.
obviously the fall must have knocked him out.
...well, it did not make him happy...
but there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
no.
mrs. mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
no.
do you know where she might be?
certainly not!
you and your husband never discussed her?
he... we did... he would not tell me her name.  we quarreled over her... of course. it came as a complete surprise to me.
a complete surprise?
yes.
but i thought you would hired a private investigator.
a private investigator?
mr. gittes.
well yes.
you would not happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.
no.
or her name?
no.
will you need me for anything else, lieutenant?
i do not think so, mrs. mulwray. of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we will be in touch.
mrs. mulwray?... mrs. mulwray.
...just a minute...
you left your keys in the ignition.
oh... thank you.
thank you for going along with me. i just did not want to explain anything... I will send you a check.
a check?
i do not want it anymore.
no?
no. it was an accident.
you mean that is what you are going to call it.
no, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. but they were not very important, just a bunch of dumb mexicans living by a dam. now beat it, gittes, you do not come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.
oh yeah? can you think of something to charge me with?
when i do, you will hear about it.
jake, what are you doin' here?
nothin', morty, it is my lunch hour, i thought I would drop by and see who died lately.
yeah? am not that something? middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns. only in l.a.
yeah. banged up pretty bad.
that is a long fall.
so how are you, morty?
yeah.
drowned, too.
come again?
yeah, got dead drunk, passed out in the bottom of the riverbed.
the l.a. river?
yeah, under hollenbeck bridge, what is wrong with that?
it is bone dry, morty.
it is not completely dry.
yeah, well he am not going to drown in a damp riverbed either, i do not care how soused he was. that is like drowning in a teaspoon.
speak english?... habla ingles?
si.
did not you talk to a man here... few days ago... wore glasses... he...
the water.
what about the water?
when it comes.
when it comes? what did you tell him?
comes in different parts of the river. every night a different part.
yeah, sophie.
a miss sessions calling.
who?
ida sessions.
do not know her. take a number.
think you can nail mulvihill? they will claim you were trespassing.
i do not want mulvihill.  i want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
then what will you do?
sue the shit out of 'em.
yeah?
yeah. what is wrong with you guys? think ahead. we find 'em, sue 'em. we will make a killing.  we will have dinner at chasen's twice a week, we will be pissing on ice the rest of our lives.
sue people like that they are liable to be having dinner with the judge who is trying the suit.
miss ida sessions again. she says you know her.
okay.
hello, miss sessions. i do not believe we have had the pleasure.
oh yes we have... are you alone, mr. gittes?
is not everybody? what can i do for you, miss sessions?
well, I am a working girl, mr. gittes. i did not come in to see you on my own.
when did you come in?
i was the one who pretended to be mrs. mulwray, remember?
shut the fuck up!  ...yes i remember nothing, miss sessions, just going over a detail or two with my associates... you were saying?
well i never expected anything to happen like what happened to mr. mulwray, the point is if it ever comes out i want somebody to know i did not know what would happen.
i understand... if you could tell me who employed you, miss sessions. that could help us both.
oh no.
...why do not you give me your address and we can talk this over?
no, mr. gittes. just look in the obituary column of today's times...
the obituary column?
you will find one of those people.
'those people?' miss sessions.
i got your check in the mall.
yes. as i said, i was very grateful.
mrs. mulwray, I am afraid that is not good enough.
well, how much would you like?
stop it. the money's fine. it is generous but you have shortchanged me on the story.
i have?
i think so. something besides your husband's death was bothering you. you were upset but not that upset.
mr. gittes...  do not tell me how i feel.
sorry. look, you sue me, your husband dies, you drop the lawsuit like a hot potato, and all of it quicker than wind from a duck's ass. excuse me. then you ask me to lie to the police.
it was not much of a lie.
if your husband was killed it was.  this can look like you paid me off to withhold evidence.
but he was not killed.
well, i suppose i am... actually i knew about the affair.
how did you find out?
my husband.
he told you?
and you were not the slightest bit upset about it?
i was grateful.
you will have to explain that, mrs. mulwray.
why?
look, i do matrimonial work, it is my metiay.  when a wife tells me she is happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.
unless what?
she is cheating on him.
i do not like the word 'cheat.'
did you have affairs?
mr. gittes.
did he know?
well i would not run home and tell him whenever i went to bed with someone, if that is what you mean.
is there anything else you want to know?
where you were when your husband died.
i can not tell you.
you mean you do not know where you were?
i mean i can not tell you.
you were seeing someone, too.
for very long?
i do not see anyone for very long, mr. gittes.  it is difficult for me. now i think you know all you need to about me. i did not want publicity. i did not want to go into any of this, then or now. is this all?
k... cross.
that your maiden name?
yes... why?
no reason.
you must have had a reason to ask me that.
no. I am just a snoop.
you seem to have had a reason for every other question.
no, not for that one.
i do not believe you.
how did it happen?
been meaning to talk to you about that.
maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
more like other people putting their business in my nose.
another satisfied client?
another satisfied client's wife.
oh, no. I have got my own car. the creamcolored packard.
wait a minute, sonny.  i think you better come with me.
what for? there is nothing more to say.  get my car, please.
mr. yelburton will be busy for some time.
well I am on my lunch hour. I will wait.
he is liable to be tied up indefinitely.
i take a long lunch. all day sometimes.
julian cross worked for the water department?
yes. no.
he did or he didn't?
he owned it.
he owned the water department?
yes.
he owned the entire water supply for the city?
yes.
how did they get it away from him?
mr. mulwray felt the public should own the display. the water. if you will just read the display.
mulwray? i thought you said cross owned the department.
along with mr. mulwray.
they were partners.
yes. yes, they were partners.
mr. gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. these staff meetings, they just go on and on.
yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.
oh yes. hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. my goodness, what happened to your nose?
i cut myself shaving.
you ought to be more careful. that must really smart.
only when i breathe.
only when you breathe... do not tell me you are still working for mrs. mulwray?
i never was.
i do not understand.
neither do i, actually. but you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.
mr. gittes, you are not making a bit of sense.
well, look at it this way, mr. yelburton.  mulwray did not want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. then he found out that you were dumping water every night. then he was drowned.
mr. gittes! that is an outrageous accusation.  i do not know what you are talking about.
well, whitey mehrholtz over at the times will. dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought.  that is news.
wait. please sit down, mr. gittes. we're... well, we are not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. as you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we have had to cut them off. the city comes first, naturally.  but, well, we have been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.
yeah, a little runoff. where are those orchards?
i said, the northwest valley.
that is like saying they are in arizona.
mr. gittes, my field men are out and i can not give you an exact location...
you are a married man, am i right?
yes...
hard working, have a wife and kids...
yes...
i do not want to nail you. i just want to know who put you up to it. I will give you a few days to think it over.  call me. i can help. who knows? maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years.
whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
money. how they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that i do not know.
I will pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to hollis and who is involved.
your father is julian cross, is not he?
yes, of course. it was quite a while after. i was just out of grade school when they did that.
so you married your father's business partner?
you have got one going, mrs. mulwray.
oh.
is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
no!... yes, a little. you see hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
over the water department, or over you?
not over me. why would they have a falling out over me?
then it was over the water department.
not exactly. well, i mean, yes. yes and no.  hollis felt the public should own the water but i do not think my father felt that way.  actually, it was over the van der lip. the dam that broke.
oh, yeah?
yes. he never forgave him for it.
never forgave him for what?
for talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... they have not spoken to this day.
you sure shout that?
of course I am sure.
what about you? do you and your father get along?
what are you thinking?
before this i turned on the faucet, it came out hot and cold, i did not think there was a thing to it.
not exactly.
but that is what you told your wife.
lots of fellas do. tell the little woman they are going on a fishing trip, then shack up with some little twist on the island... she pretty?
I am going to see a man called julian cross. ever heard of him?
is the pope catholic? who are you, mister?... i ask because he does not see a whole lot of people.
I am working for his daughter.
that right?... she used to be some looker.
she am not exactly long in the tooth now.
she must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
you must be thinking of a different daughter.
no, he is only got one, i remember her age, i read it in the newspapers when she ran away.
she ran away?
oh yeah, it was a big thing at the time. julian cross' daughter. god almighty. she was a wild little thing.
course, she settled down nicely.
well, you never know, do you?
that is for sure.
why did she run away?
oh, you know. she was sixteen or seventeen.
we missed the best of it, did not we, pal?
she ran off to mexico. rumor was she was knocked up and did not even know who the father was. went there to get rid of it.
you do not say?
cross was looking for her all over the country. offered rewards, everything. felt real sorry for him, with all his money.
sir?
i said horseshit.  horseshit.
yes, sir, that is what it looks like. I will give you that.
always?
what?  oh, damn near yes. unless the animal's sick or something.  and the steam rising off it like that in the morning. that is life, mr. gittes. life.
you know, you have got a nasty reputation, mr. gittes. i like that.
thanks.
if you were a bank president that would be one thing, but in your business it is admirable. and it is good advertising.
it does not hurt.
it is why you attract a client like my daughter.
probably.
but I am surprised you are still working for her, unless she is suddenly come up with another husband.
no. she happens to think the last one was murdered.
how did she get that idea?
i think i gave it to her.
fine, as long as you do not serve chicken that way.
tell me. what do the police say?
they are calling it an accident.
who is the investigating officer?
lou escobar  he is a lieutenant.
do you know him?
oh yes.
where from?
we worked in chinatown together.
would you call him a capable man?
very.
honest?
far as it goes. of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
of course, but you have got no reason to think he is bungled the case?
none.
that is too bad.
too bad?
it disturbs me, mr. gittes. it makes me think you are taking my daughter for a ride. financially speaking, of course. how much are you charging her?
my usual fee, plus a bonus if i come up with any results.
are you sleeping with her? come, come, mr. gittes. you do not have to think about that to remember, do you?
if you want an answer to that question i can always put one of my men on the job. good afternoon, mr. cross.
mr. gittes!  you are dealing with a disturbed woman who is lost her husband. i do not want her taken advantage of. sit down.
what for?
you may think you know what you are dealing with, but believe me, you don't.
why is that funny?
it is what the d.a. used to tell me about chinatown.
was he right?
...exactly what do you know about me, mr. gittes?
mainly that you are rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
'course I am respectable. I am old. politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I will double whatever your fees are and I will pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find hollis' girlfriend.
his girlfriend?
yes, his girlfriend.
you mean the little chippie he was with at the el macando?
yes. she is disappeared, has not she?
yeah.
does not that strike you as odd?
no. she is probably scared to death.
would not it be useful to talk to her?
maybe.
if mulwray was murdered, she was probably one of the last people to see him.
you did not see mulwray much, did you?
no.
when was the last time?
sheriff's gold posse... bunch of damn fools who pay $5,000 apiece to the sheriff's reelection. i let 'em practice up out here.
yeah. do you remember the last time you talked to mulwray?
at my age, you tend to lose track...
well, it was about five days ago. you were outside the pig 'n whistle and you had one hell of an argument.
I have got the photographs in my office. if they will help you remember. what was the argument about?
my daughter.
what about her?
just find the girl, mr. gittes. i think she is frightened and i happen to know hollis was fond of her. I would like to help her if i can.
i did not realize you and hollis were so fond of each other.
hollis mulwray made this city and he made me a fortune... we were a lot closer than evelyn realized.
if you want to hire me, i still have to know what you and mulwray were arguing about.
well... she is an extremely jealous person. i did not want her to find out about the girl.
how did you find out?
I have still got a few teeth in my head, mr. gittes, and a few friends in town.
okay. my secretary'll send you a letter of agreement. tell me are you worried about that girl, or what evelyn might do to her?
just find the girl.
I will look into it as soon as i check out some avocado groves.
avocado groves?
we will be in touch, mr. cross.
I will settle for l.a. county.
row twenty-three, section c.
how come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
land sales out of escrow are always recorded within the week.
then these are all new owners?
that is right.
but that means that most of the valley's been sold in the last few months.
if that is what it says.
can i check one of these volumes out?
sir, this is not a lending library, it is the hall of records.
well, then, how about a ruler?
a ruler?
the print's pretty fine. i forgot my glasses. I would like to be able to read across.
no problem with me on the job.
yeah.  do you have any references?
city of la habra heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.
that is swell. but how about here?  ever worked for robert knox, emma dill, clarence speer, marian parsons, or jasper lamar crabb?
never heard of 'em... new owners?
yeah.
lot of turnover these days. better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
yeah, I will do that.
that dam is a con job.
what dam?
the one your husband opposed. they are conning l.a. into building it, only the water will not go to l.a. it will go here.
the valley?
everything you can see, everything around us. i was at the hall of records today.  that bother you?
no.
in the last three months, robert knox has bought 7,000 acres, emma dill 12,000 acres, clarence speer 5,000 acres, and jasper lamar crabb 25,000 acres.
jasper lamar crabb?
know him?
no, i think I would remember.
yeah. they have been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? about thirty million more than they paid.
and hollis knew about it?
it is why he was killed. jasper lamar crabb. jasper lamar crabb.
we got it. we got it, baby.
what? what is it?
there was a memorial service at the mar vista inn today for jasper lamar crabb. he died three weeks ago.
is that unusual?
two weeks ago he bought those 25,000 acres. that is unusual.
oh my goodness.
nothing to do with dad. it is me, actually.
naturally, i want the best for him, money is no object.
perhaps if we could meet your father.
there is just one question.
of course.
do you accept anyone of the jewish persuasion?
I am sorry. we don't.
do not be sorry, neither does dad. wanted to make sure though, did not we, honey?
just to be certain, i wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
we do not reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. i know you would appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
that is exactly what we wanted to hear.
oh, good.
i wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
i do not think so. be happy to show you.
would you mind if we took a stroll on our own?
just, if you will, confine yourself to the main building. it is nearly bedtime.
we understand, c'mon, sweetheart.
you are looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.
they can not be.
they may not know it but they are.
yes.
I have been wanting to meet you.
why?
did you know that you are a very wealthy woman?
I am not.
well you own a lot of land.
not anymore. oh, some time ago, my late husband owned a good deal of beach property in long beach, but we lost it.
that is just lovely.
thank you...
where did you get this material?
the apple core club.
the apple core?
no. the albacore. it is a fish. my grandson's a member and they take very nice care of us.
how do they do that?
give us things. not just some old flag like this, but -
but what?
I will stay.
get in the car.
maid's night off?
why?
what do you mean, 'why?' nobody's here, that is all.
i gave everybody the night off.
easy, it is an innocent question.
no question from you is innocent, mr. gittes.
i guess not to you, mrs. mulwray. frankly you really saved my a... my neck tonight.
tell me something. does this usually happen to you, mr. gittes?
what is that, mrs. mulwray?
well, I am only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that is how you go about your work, I would say you are lucky to get through a whole day.
actually this has not happened to me in some time.
when was the last time?
why?
just. i do not know why. I am asking.
it was in chinatown.
what were you doing there?
working for the district attorney.
doing what?
as little as possible.
the district attorney gives his men advice like that?
they do in chinatown.
boy oh boy, you are a mess.
yeah.
so why does it bother you to talk about it... chinatown...
bothers everybody who works there, but to me... it was...
hold still. why?
you can not always tell what is going on there.
...no. why was it.
i thought i was keeping someone from being hurt and actually i ended up making sure they were hurt.
could you do anything about it?
what is wrong?
your eye.
what about it?
there is something black in the green part of your eye.
oh that... it is a flaw in the iris...
...a flaw...
...yes, sort of a birthmark...
where?
just... i have to.
and i want to know where.
please do not be angry... believe me, it is got nothing to do with you.
where are you going?
please!... trust me this much...  I will be back. look, there is something i should tell you. the fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
the albacore club.
it has to do with my father.
i know.
he owns it. you know?
i saw him.
you saw my fa... father? when?
this morning.
you did not tell me.
there has not been a lot of time.
what did he say?  what did he say?
that you were jealous, and he was worried about what you might do.
do? to who?
mulwray's girlfriend, for one thing. he wanted to know where she was.
i want you to listen to me. my father is a very dangerous man. you do not know how dangerous. you do not know how crazy.
give me an example.
you may think you know what is going on, but you don't.
that is what your father said. you are telling me he is in back of this whole thing?
it is possible.
including the death of your husband?
it is possible. please do not ask me any more questions now. just wait, wait for me. I will be back. i need you here.
okay, give me the keys.
you bastard.
it is either that or you drive to the police yourself.
the police?
c'mon, mrs. mulwray. you have got your husband's girlfriend tied up in there!
she is not tied up!
you know what i mean. you are keeping her there against her will.
i am not!
then let's go talk to her.
she is too upset.
what about?
hollis' death. i tried to keep it from her, i did not want her upset before i could make plans for her to leave.
you mean she just found out?
yes.
that is not what it looks like, mrs. mulwray.
what does it look like?
like she knows about hollis' death. like she knows more than you want her to tell.
you are insane.
just tell me the truth. I am not the police. i do not care what you have done. I am not going to hurt you, but one way or another I am going to know.
you will not go to the police if i tell you?
i will if you don't.
i can't...
because of hollis? because she was seeing your husband? was that it? jesus christ, say something. was that it?
i took your husband's buick...  I will return it tomorrow.
are not you coming back with me?
do not worry. I am not telling anybody about this.
...that's not what i meant.
gittes?... gittes?
yeah.
ida sessions wants to see you.
who?
yeah?... i do?
sure you do.
well, tell you what, pal. if ida wants to see me she can call me at my office.
what are you doing here?
did not you call?
how do you happen to know her?
i don't.
let me show you something.
is not that your number?
is it? i forget. i do not call myself that often.
just to be on the safe side, we had loach here give you a ring.
yeah, i took 'em. so what?
how did she...  ...happen to have them?
you really think I am stupid, do not you, gittes?
i do not think about it one way or the other. but if you want, give me a day or two, and I will get back to you. now I would like to go home.
i want the rest of the pictures.
what pictures?
this broad hired you, gittes, not evelyn mulwray.
yeah?
yeah. somebody wanted to shake down mulwray, she hired you, and that is how you happen to know mulwray was murdered.
i heard it was an accident.
c'mon, you think you are dealing with a bunch of assholes? mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs! now how did he get that... in a fresh water reservoir?
you were following him night and day. you saw who killed him. you even took pictures of it. it was evelyn mulwray. she is been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
you accusing me of extortion?
absolutely.
i do not think i need a day or two. you are even dumber than you think i think you are. not only that, I would never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that is where i draw the line, escobar.
yeah, i once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she would never shit on his chest. that is where she drew the line.
well, i hope she was not too much of a disappointment to you, lou.
i want those photographs, gittes. we are talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. minimum.
why do you think mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? evelyn mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the oak pass reservoir?
mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody did not want his body found in the ocean.
and why is that?
he found out somebody was dumping water there. that is what they were trying to cover up by moving him.
what are you talking about?
c'mon I will show you.
it is too late.
too late for what?
they only dump the water at night.
i know what he says.
shut up.  go on.
hello.
have you got your checkbook handy, mr. cross? I have got the girl.
you have got her? where?
do you remember the figures we discussed?
of course i do. where are you?
at your daughter's house. how soon can you get here?
two hours... tell me, will evelyn be there as well?
either that or she will be in jail.
what are you talking about?
just bring your checkbook.
did you get some sleep?
sure.
did you have lunch? kyo will fix you something.
where is the girl?
upstairs. why?
i want to see her.
...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?
going somewhere?
yes, we have got a 4:30 train to catch. why?
j. j. gittes for lieutenant escobar
what are you doing? what is wrong? i told you we have got a 4:30.
you are going to miss your train!  lou, meet me at 1412 adelaide. it is above santa monica canyon... yeah, soon as you can.
what did you do that for?
you know any good criminal lawyers?
no...
do not worry. i can recommend a couple. they are expensive but you can afford it.
what the hell is this all about?
i found these in your backyard... in your fish pond. they belonged to your husband, did not they?... did not they?
i do not know. i mean yes, probably.
yes positively. that is where he was drowned...
what are you saying?
there is no time for you to be shocked by the truth, mrs. mulwray. the coroner's report proves he was killed in salt water. just take my word for it. now i want to know how it happened and why. i want to know before escobar gets here because i want to hang onto my license.
i do not know what you are talking about. this is the most insane... the craziest thing i ever...
stop it!  I will make it easy. you were jealous, you fought, he fell, hit his head. it was an accident, but his girl is a witness. you have had to pay her off. you do not have the stomach to harm her, but you have got the money to shut her up. yes or no?
...no...
who is she? and do not give me that crap about it being your sister. you do not have a sister.
that is good. now what is her name?
katherine.
katherine?... katherine who?
she is my daughter.
i said the truth!
she is my sister.
i said i want the truth.
she is my sister and my daughter!
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... i was fifteen... he would ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... it happened... then i ran away...
to mexico...
hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... i could not see her... i wanted to but i couldn't... i just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that is all...  but i do not want her to know... i do not want her to know...
...so that is why you hate him...
yeah... where are you taking her now?
back to mexico.
you can not go by train. escobar'll be looking for you everywhere.
how about a plane?
that is worse... just get out of here. walk out, leave everything.
i have to go home and get my things.
I will take care of it.
where can we go?
...where does kyo live?
with us.
on his day off. get the exact address.
okay...
how do you know?
he did not wear bifocals.
sophie... is walsh there?... yeah, listen, pal, escobar's going to try and book me in about five minutes... relax, I will tell you. wait in the office for two hours. if you do not hear from me, you and duffy meet me at 1712 alameda.
jesus, that is in chinatown, am not it?
i do not suppose you got any idea where she went?
matter of fact i do.
where?
her maid's house. i think she knows something is up.
what is the maid's address?
she lives in pedro. I will write it down for you.
no, gittes, you will show us.
what for?
if she is not there, you are going downtown, and you are staying there til she shows up.
gee, lou, I am doing the best i can.
tell us about it on the way to pedro.
that is it?
yeah.
well, let's go.
do me a favor, will you, lou?
you never learn, do you, gittes?
i guess not.
give you three minutes.
gee, thanks, lou.
gee, this is a surprise, mr. gittes.
call me jake. how is everything?
just sitting down to supper, jake. care to join us?
no thanks.
how about a glass of wine? honey, this is...
sure thing.
curly, where is your car?
in the garage.
where is that?
off the alley.
could you drive me somewhere?
sure, as soon as we eat.
right now, curly. it can not wait.
I will just tell my wife.
tell her later.
how much do you owe me, curly?
oh, gee, mr. gittes we are going out tomorrow. i know you been real good about it but my cousin auggie's sick.
forget it. how would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to ensenada... you would have to leave tonight.
i do not know...
i might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. maybe an even hundred.
plus what i owe you?
I will throw that in too.
okay, you got yourself a boat.
tell mrs. mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. then if i do not show, take her down to the boat.
you sure this is okay?
curly, you know how long i been in business.
well, you do not look any the worse for wear, mr. gittes, i must say... where is the girl?...
I have got her.
is she all right?
she is fine.
where is she?
with her mother.
I would like you to look at something, mr. cross.
what is it?
an obituary column... can you read in this light?
yes... i think i can manage...
what does this mean?
that you killed hollis mulwray.
...the coroner's report showed mulwray had salt water in his lungs.
hollie was always fond of tide-pools. you know what he used to say about them?
have not the faintest idea.
that is where life begins... marshes, sloughs, tide-pools... he was fascinated by them...  you know when we first came out here he figured that if you dumped water onto desert sand it would percolate down into the bedrock and stay there, instead of evaporating the way it does in most reservoirs. you would lose only twenty percent instead of seventy or eighty. he made this city.
and that is what you were going to do in the valley?
no, mr. gittes. that is what i am doing with the valley. the bond issue passes tuesday. there'll be ten million to build an aqueduct and reservoir. I am doing it.
there is going to be some irate citizens when they find out they are paying for water they are not getting.
that is all taken care of. you see, mr. gittes. either you bring the water to l.a. or you bring l.a. to the water.
how do you do that?
just incorporate the valley into the city so the water goes to l.a. after all. it is very simple.
how much are you worth?
i have no idea. how much do you want?
i want to know what you are worth. over ten million?
oh, my, yes.
then why are you doing it? how much better can you eat? what can you buy that you can not already afford?
the future, mr. gittes. the future. now where is the girl?... i want the only daughter i have left... as you found out, evelyn was lost to me a long time ago.
who do you blame for that? her?
let me handle that.
I am all right.
sure, but I would like to handle it.
duffy, go over and sit on mulvihill.  jesus christ, i did not tell you to bring the police department with you.
jake, it is chinatown. they are all over the place. you oughta know better.
gimme your keys. watch this old fart, will you?  take duffy's car. curly's boat's in pedro, near the starkist cannery. it is the evening star. he will be waiting. I will take care of this.
mrs. mulwray, you do not want to run around like that.
oh, christ. escobar, you do not know what is going on. let her go. I will explain it later.
mrs. mulwray, it is a very serious offense pointing that at an officer of the law. it is a felony.
let her go. she did not kill anybody.
I am sorry, mrs. mulwray.
lou, she will kill you. let her go for now. you do not know.
gittes, stay outta this.
who is he, get his name? I will kill him.
take it easy, take it easy, it was an accident.
an accident?
get him away from her. he is responsible for everything. get him away from her!
jake, you are very disturbed. you are crazy. that is her father.
