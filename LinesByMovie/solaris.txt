what is wrong?  what happened to gibarian?
he is dead.
how?
you did not bring any chocolate, did you?
what?
i love chocolate.  i realized just yesterday how much i love it.  i thought maybe, if they let you bring personal effects, you might have snuck some through, because... well, I have been thinking about it.
i can not talk just now.  I am too tired.
where is sartorius?
in his lab.  he will not let you in.
he will let me in.
kelvin, if you see anything unusual...
you have to give me your word you will not come in.  then I will come out.
all right.
what happened to gibarian?
did not you talk to snow?
i want to hear your version.
who, here, could possibly care what you want?  at best, you are employee of the month for the highest bidder in the solaris auction.  they have no idea what is going on up here. they have never even been in space. and I am supposed to listen to you?
i am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  now: what happened to him?
the same thing that could happen to any of us.
where is his body?
in the lab.  with her, probably.
her?  who are you talking about?
they should not let people like you into space.
just so you know: I am not going back until i understand what it is.  i am going to figure out what it is, make it stop, and then i will go home.
listen --
we are done.  oh, i should tell you, i do not trust snow.  there is something wrong with him.
is there anybody else here?
why, who did you see?
gibarian warned me.  he left me a message.
who was it?
she was real.  where did she come from?
tell me.  i will not think you are insane.
oh, that is a relief.
how much sleep do you need?
how much sleep?
how long can you go without sleep?
that depends.
well, when you do go to sleep: barricade your door.
oh, god.  I am awake.
yes.
i need to see snow.
I will go with you.
I will just be a minute.
don't.
why?
i do not know.  i can not be alone.
I will be right back.
what are they?
to calm your anxiety.
to calm my anxiety.
we are taking a flight?
yes.
was her breakfast conversation that bad?
shut up.
i told you, try to stay calm.  you are supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
what was it?
personally, i think it is god.  at least, it fits my definition.
and professionally?
I am not sure.  it started with gibarian.  he locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door.  he covered the video lens. obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown.  i do not know why he did not tell us he had somebody in there.  by this time, we were getting visitors, too.  he was desperately trying to figure it out.  day and night.  who was she?
my wife.
dead?
she has materialized from your memory of her.  what was her name?
rheya.
it started about three months ago. right after the government sold the expedition.  we were ready to go home.
will she come back?
probably.
i wish you would told me.
told you what?
what will you say?
to who?
what are you going to report back to earth?
i do not know.
an enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. we are in little danger of being left alone for long.  you will need to do something. otherwise they will be sending someone out to recover you.
gibarian said he thinks solaris should be destroyed.
that is ludicrous.  this is contact. we have found god.  the only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on earth.  so how will we describe it, if we choose to describe it at all?
rheya...
i want you inside me right now.
"and death shall have no dominion".
book?
poem.  dylan thomas.  i thought of it when i saw you on the train.
my thomas is a little rusty.
not a very happy poem.
you did not look very happy.
i wasn't.
and tonight?
better.
you want to fuck her?
stop it.
you behave as though you want to fuck her.
rheya.  not here.
and i just want to know if I am crazy or not -- if what i think is happening is actually happening.  or am i one of those people, those women, who are blind to what is going on?  who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
let's go home.
you go home.
i am.  please come with me.  i do not want to do this here.
you talk like an actor.
you are better when you take them.
i know, i know.  but still, somehow i do not feel better.
all right.  how about i feel better when you take them?
what do you remember?
what do you mean?
do you remember beethoven?  the beatles?  movies, books, restaurants, friends?
yes.  but not until you mentioned them.  as soon as you said those things, i remembered them.  and they have associations that make me think of other things i remember.  it is like filling up.
is it a planet?
not exactly.  it exists in a continuum that was not proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the universe. an infinite number of them, in fact. it was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the universe, space, or space-time.  it was completely counter-intuitive.  we had to unlearn everything.
is it intelligent?
intelligent beyond our comprehension.
then it is god, right?
it is something.
you still do not believe in god?
the whole idea of god was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called man.  even the limits we put on it are human limits.  it can do this, it can do that!  it designs, it creates!
even a god that was not active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
you are talking about a man in a white beard again.  you are ascribing human characteristics to something that is not human.  human beings look for causes and patterns.  how could we know what solaris is up to, if anything?
but what if solaris is what there was before the big bang?
as i said, it is beyond our comprehension.
as i said, then it is god, right?
kelvin, you awake?
what is it?
can you meet me and sartorius on b deck in an hour?
why?
just a little strategy session.  but in person this time.
what happened?
you were trying to break down the door.  do you know why?
when i saw you were gone i got scared.
he will not do it.
why do you say that?
he won't.
we thought you would be alone.  we want to talk about...
we want to talk freely.
they are not autonomous individuals and they are not actual persons. they are projections materializing from our minds, based on a given individual.
it is an experiment.
no.  there is no behavior modification.
she reappeared exactly as she had before?
a recoil, with no compensating mechanism.
and when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
followed by non-human manifestations.
are the actions of solaris premeditated?
is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  i do not think so.
I am just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
when you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?
where have you been?
i been thinking about how much i hate you.
i would have these -- i do not know how to describe them -- visions, when i was younger.  maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  time would just collapse, i would be inside time.  i would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  freaky stuff.
how old were you?
seven, eight.  so one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I am doing, and i start trying to explain to her, about this state that i can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
what kind of look?
scared.  no, not scared.  wary. like i was something to be... her guard went up.  i was a threat.  now i know why.  she was afraid she would be seen.  that i would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. i think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. but that is the cycle, right?  i knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  i guess that is part of the reason why --
i know.  i know.  we do not have to talk about that.
thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  i loved it so much, that feeling.
i did too.
what happened to us, exactly?
you do not know?
why did you say those things?
i do not know.  i could not understand why you did not tell me.
i can not help feeling that I am cheating when i take them.
it is genetics.  you know this.  you know where it comes from.  there is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
you are unnerved because you have spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book.  we are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own.  that proves that --
-- we are not sure of that.  we are not sure we are not all hallucinating.
if god is beyond our comprehension, and she --  -- is here for reasons that can not be understood, is not god here?
not necessarily.
stop equivocating!  unbelievable, how you equivocate!  you, the atheist, you are more dogmatic than any holy person I have ever seen!  this is happening, kelvin.  wake up.
consciousness is enough, that is all I have saying.  consciousness should be enough for anybody.
who are you trying to convince?
do you have any idea how much i like fucking you?
i think so.
good.  because i want you to know. i really like fucking you.
i like that too.
how could she not be real?  i can smell her, taste her.  she does exactly what she did... it is not possible.
you know, I have decided: I am just going to believe what you believe about this whole solaris thing, it will make life so much easier; the little wife agreeing with her big, strong husband. you must get such a headache thinking about those great big problems all day.
you sure say "god" a lot when we are doing it.
i know.  I am putting that in my next report.
what does snow think you should do?
snow thinks we should not leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet earth.  this is hilarious: he thinks it is god, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
sartorius wants to destroy it.
well.  he does not think it is god, but for different reasons than me. he is thinking: if i can figure out how to make it stop, than i am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be god.
he has a point.
he does have a point.  that is just not the way I would like to see it proven.
you feel sorry for solaris, or for me?
it is a violent response to something we have not figured out.  do not let the cowardly demeanor fool you: he is ruthless.  unblinking in his prejudice.
it was obvious from the way he first looked at me.
do i really feel like... i am...?
yes.  yes.
I am glad.
what is wrong.
you do not love me.
stop.
what are you talking about?
that i am not rheya.  that rheya died.  killed herself.  I am different.
who have you been talking to?
sartorius.
when?  when I am asleep?
I am sure there are worse people to talk to, but i do not know who they are.
I am just trying to understand what is going on.
but we fought.
yes.  especially toward the end.
why did she do it?
you... she said i did not love her.
was she right?
no.  i love you.
i love you, too.
can you sleep?
i do not think do.  it is not sleep; it is something else.  it is all around me.
those are dreams.
gibarian was under enormous --
gibarian was helpless.  it is very simple: man created the science that resulted in the discovery of solaris, and the ship that brought us here.
meaning man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
yes.
that is fantastic.
why did you agree to come here?
you are the coward.
do not debate him; he will say anything.
I am just as human as you.  i see, i hear, i touch, and i feel just like you do.
we can liquidate the station.  take the athena back.
no.
of course, when we return, we will be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth.  we will chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
I have never heard you express any desire to leave before now.  why now?
well, i think we are reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  certainly it is learning more about us than we will ever learn about it.
but why is it doing what it is doing? given it is resources, it could have done anything.  presented me with your double, and you with mine.
perhaps it did.
human beings can die.
but they are human.  they certainly become human with incredible speed. first they are like they were in our memory, but then they fill in on their own.  dna does not determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain, it is not dense enough.  they build up with experience.
they come when you sleep.
that is right.  and we all have to sleep, eventually.
you do not want me.
rheya.
that is what you were saying.  i heard what you were saying.
for a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  that is all i know right now.
i have these strange thoughts, i do not know where they come from.  i can not explain it.
neither can i.  not any of it. there is no reference point for what is going on; it is never happened before. it is a clean break in the fabric of the universe; a gap.  there is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
but that is what happened before.
not this time.
do you want to stay here?
do you?
if you are here.
gibarian.
leave the light off.
you think you are dreaming me, like you dream her.  understand something: i am the real gibarian.  just a new incarnation.
what do you want?
you are being tricked.  sartorius picked a fight with you to avoid telling you about his idea for getting rid of the visitors.  he is figured out they are made of subatomic particles called neutrinos, and he is going to create a negative neutrino field.  twenty four hours a day, until they are back on earth.
can it work?
it can.  ordinary matter, like ours? not affected.  everything else, disintegrates.
what I am saying is: do not trust anyone.  find yourself a weapon of some sort.
i can trust rheya.
you will end up like me.
you are not gibarian...
no?  who am i, then?
a puppet.
and you are not?  maybe you are my puppet.  but like all puppets, you think you are actually human.  it is the puppet's dream.  wondering if they are human!
what is wrong?
gibarian.  he was here.
you said he was dead.
he is.  but he was here...
what is happening to us?
it is all right.
please do not lie.  i told you before, i do not know how i came to be here. whatever you think you can not say to me, i need to hear you say it.
i love you.
don't.  I am the one at risk here. if we are playing out what happened before, i will not survive.
that will not happen again.  we are different.
how can i tell?  you have seen both of me.  i only know what you are like here.  you are all i know.  there is no "you" from before.
how could it be so cruel?  how could it torture us like this?
i do not think it knows it is torturing us.  it is just watching.
what happened?
she drank liquid oxygen.
why do you think she has not suggested that?  it is the most obvious solution: escape.  she knows she can not leave here --
get out --
oh, this one you love?  what about the first one, the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space?  you did not love her?
I am not rheya.  you have always known that.
rheya --
do not call me that.
listen: i do not care about anything but the fact that you are here.  you are her, you are rheya.
I am disgusting.
no.
you are lying.  I am not human.
rheya, i am not going back.  I am staying here with you.
then you will die.
i want every second i can get with you.
do not do this.  i am literally begging you not to do this.  chris.
you should have told me.
it would not have made any difference.
thank you.
chris, i had to.  i had to.  i did not think you would react like this.
neither did i.
you never said you wanted one.
i never said i didn't.
chris --
i can not stay here.
chris, please.  chris, I am serious. i will not make it.
then you will not make it.
what do i have to do to stop it?
i want you here.
you are lying.
you exist here.  i keep telling you.
that is impossible.  I am not rheya.
who are you, then?
i... i am rheya.  but i am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
yes, you are --
did you hear what gibarian said? I am not a human being.  I am an instrument.  i came from your memory and your imagination and i will torture you no matter what.  even if i remain passive.  that is when i drank the...  i was going mad.  it felt like there was no body underneath my skin. there was something else.  an illusion.  but i could feel my heart beating, and i remembered you tested my blood.  is it like yours?
yes.  i told you.  it was exactly like mine.
but then i would be dead now.
is that really what you want?
i want to stop taking those pills.
i wish you wouldn't.
they do something to me.  it is hard to think straight.
i think they help.
i have consciousness, but i am not mortal.  do not you see why I am going crazy?
you have to remember that i love you, that is all that matters --
i can not --
it put you here.  I will admit it, it acted like a god and put you here, put you into my consciousness.  i was asleep, and it put you into my dream.  i saw your mouth.  and there you were.  whether you have been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it does not matter.  the decision we make now is all that matters.  stay with me.
am i really her?
i do not know anymore.  all i see is you.
she knows everything.  she knows who she is.
she knows everything?  does she know she came once before and you put her in --
no.
what do you want?
i want you to get sartorius to abandon his plan.
what plan?
just get him to stop.
what do you want to do, leave the station with her?
yes.
kelvin, she will disintegrate.  you do not believe me?  let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I have charted it is trajectory, only take a few hours...
her oxygen would have run out.
maybe she does not need any.  should we check?
who are you trying to please? yourself?  her?  which her, this one or that one.  can you face both?  we are in a situation that is beyond morality.  so: leave with her.  you will see the transformation.
into what?
you will see her die, that is all. they are mortal, despite what she told you.  she will die.  then what will you do?
i love her.
you do, you don't.  she is willing to give her life, you are willing to give yours, it is touching and magnificent, anything you want but -- this is not the place for it.  do not you see?  no, you don't.
what are you taking?
a sleeping pill.  do you want yours?
what does it want?
i do not know.  something.  anything.
I have decided that if it is god, it is a sick god.  its ambitions exceed its powers, but it does not realize it.  it is created a situation without a goal, and i hate that.  a god whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.  and us?  we would have to have "an arrangement".  an unspoken understanding that i am not human. how can i not hate something that does that?
please.  don't.
where did you go before?
when?
last night.  you were talking to someone in the corridor.
you must have been dreaming.
you killed her!
not her.  it.
you murdered her!
kelvin, she begged me.  i had a short- range version of the destabilizer prototype, a miniature with a range of a few meters.  she walked into it and disappeared.  she was gone.
she will come back.
no, she won't.
why would you let her to do that?
it is not human, kelvin.  whatever it is, it is not human, and i am threatened by that.  evolution-of- the-species-at-stake threatened. and i want to win.  i want humans to win.  so i am killing it before it kills me.
you fucking bastard...
whose side are you on?
it is changing characteristics.  it is solidifying taking on weight.
how quickly?
if it continues, it will implode from its own weight and turn into a black hole in about four hours and pulls us in with it.
where is snow?  did you call him?
yes.
what is wrong with you?  we need your help.
i will not be making the trip.
snow, get up here, now.
I am not snow.
i got rid of him.  i wanted to see if... i wanted to be the only one. i wanted to be snow.
fuck me.  i knew it.
when did this happen?
oh, right away.  that is why you never saw me with anyone.  you should have noticed that.  i miss him, though. i think i made a mistake.
jesus...
but i can not leave with you.  i will not make it.
maybe you can.
you want it coming back with us?
you go ahead.  of what i remember about earth... it is all one thing now.  everything's a blur.  i like distinctions.
how can you be here...
shhhh.  just stay with me.  stay with me.  everything is forgiven. everything.
