so, edwin, baby, this is sunrise confession time... what have you got for us?
i... i... went to this bar... this very, ya know -- hard-to-get-in place... called babbitt's...
yeah, i know the place.  it is one of those chic yuppie gathering holes.
okay... i know but... i met this beautiful girl...
yeah, but does she swallow, edwin?
i think she likes me... she gave me her number, but she must work a lot cause when i call she is never home... but i think we will go out this weekend... i've...
yeah, edwin, sure... and pinnochio is a true story... edwin!  wake up! this is a fairytale...
no, jack, no, it is not... she likes me.
she gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
she likes me.  she said for me to call!
can i ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
you can ask.
about dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  raoul?
you are so witty.  I am so jealous... i need to get out of here, jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
you know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... it would be nice if you acted like you understood.
fine.  I will say no.
they are putting me on film tomorrow.
fine.
... first time in my life I will be a voice with a body.  do you know what that means?  what this could lead to?
jack, it is a sitcom -- you are not defining pi.
I will remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran.  want some?
no, i have to work.
how un-sixties of you.
i was nine in the sixties.
i used to think my biography would be jack lucas - the face behind the voice, but now it can be jack lucas, the face "and" the voice...or maybe just jack - exclamation point...
are you in a mood today baby? is this one of those days when you are in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  talk to me, cause i do not understand these moods.
anne, they are my moods. if you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
why do not you go upstairs... take the day off. all right?...i'll cook tonight.
well, it is funny!  whatta want from me?
it is not funny.  it's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
then why the hell do we watch all the time?
because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how america does not know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny tv celebrity because that would just mean that I am not really talented.
it happens to be a beautiful love story.  ya know, you used to like that about me.  you used to say you liked that i did not make you think so much.  that we could be together and not think...
yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
you should not hang around this neighborhood.
i... i was just leaving.
people spend a lot of hard earned money for this neighborhood.  it is not fair... looking out their windows to see your ass asleep on the streets...
yes... i... i agree...
good.  you believe this drunk?
.....me neither.
no...no please...!
unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
it is just a bum...you know, there is enough in here for the two of you.
ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish...now begone...before somebody drops a house on you!...
you a fag too?
fag..a fag you say!?... "curst wolf! thy fury inward on thyself pray and consume thee!"
fuck you.
owww....what are you nuts?!
bingo! tell the man what he is won!
i advise you to let us go.
you advise us!
you are out numbered son.
come on! go for it! what the hell are they going to do? they can not do nothin!
nothing! they can do nothing! gentlemen!
are you all right?
oww...man...
please do not hurt me?
"oh beings blind! what ignorance besets you!
you can not leave me tied up out here alone, you fucking faggot!
you will not be alone for long.
i need a drink.
i know a great place.  ...uh...warren!
this is it. I am in hell. damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
great place huh?
have i died?
hahahahaaa... nononono... not yet... hahahaha...
if you are going to murder me, that is fine... just do not laugh.
where am i?
my abode... my domicile... my neck of the woods... hungry?  breakfast?  a fruit pie perhaps?
no... thanks... listen --
my name is parry.
hi... where are my shoes?
they are --  -- what?
where -- ?
what!?
what?!
sshhhh!
do you know what the little people just told me?
the little people?
they said you are the one.
I am the one what?
oh shut up!!!
... I have got a right to say something.  i mean, you are tying my hands here!  they say you are not ready to know.
I am not...  now, where are those shoes...
... do you know who i am?
uhh... I am drawing a blank.
take a guess...  let him guess!!  tch.
uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante...
no, no... i mean that sort of happens along the way but no...  I am on a very special quest.
a quest?
but i need help and they sent you.
the little...
they work for him.
him...?
god... I am the janitor of god.
the holy grail?  some billionaire has the holy grail sitting in a commode on madison avenue?
i know!  you can not imagine how surprised i was.  who would think you could find anything divine on the upper east side.
listen... i do not mean to be flippant or to enrage you or anything but... you are an imbecile.  and I am not the one... I am not any one...
i think you are a very nice... very nice psychotic man.  i really appreciate what you did for me.  it was a very brave and noble thing...
oh, please... you are embarrassing me.
i wish you all the luck in the world. when you get the grail, I am sure I will be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...
but i can not get it... he's...
see, you do not know him... that is why you are the one... you can get it...
listen, forget the shoes.  I will just take a cab... uh...
parry.
parry... I am jack.
i know...
thanks... you can keep the doll.
thanks a mill --  and I will give you a buzz as soon as i hear from the people upstairs and we will get this thing off the ground... thanks for stopping by, jack.  give my love to the wife and kids.
I am not married.
funny -- you look married.
where you comin' from?!
uh... basement i think...
i tell him no visitors!!!
you a friend of parry's?
no...  he is supposed to live there?
yeah, well... i let him stay there. what else could i do after such a tragedy?
tragedy?
he and his wife was were at some bar ..and some nut came in with a shotgun and blew the place apart. she was a beautiful girl...she never knew what hit her.
I am sorry.
i smell gas... do you smell gas...
i can not tell you how distraught i was.  all night long.  what the hell happened?
i was attacked.
what!
two kids tried to set me on fire.
oh my god... what did they do!  my god!!!
you were attacked.  my god.  should i call a doctor!  did you call the police...
no, I am fine... really...
you are all right... you sure...
... so... where did you sleep last night?
i... i stayed at a friend's.  listen, i --
please... before you go on... let me tawk... okay... we have had a wonderful time together... when we first met, you said this was not serious and i should not get serious and then you moved in and we have not been serious. and i just wanna say that i have no regrets.  none.  and do not wanna have any now so i want ya to be up front with me... i want the truth. if you are seein' somebody else, let me know... you do not have to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me.  just tell me the truth.
I am not seeing anyone else.  i really was attacked.
okay.  ... i love you...
oh, i used to be such a catholic.
you still believe in god?
oh sure... got to believe in god.  but i do not think god made man in his own image.  no.  'cause most of... the bullshit that happens, is because of men.  no, i think man was made out of the devil's image and women were created out of god -- because women can have babies which is sorta like creating, and which also explains why women are attracted to men, because, lets face it, the devil is a helluva lot more interesting -- i slept with a few saints and let me tell you... booooorring!!!... and so the whole point of life, i think, is for men and women to get married so the devil and god can live together and, ya know -- work it out...  ... not that we have to get married.
... you have a little... uh... something on your face...
oh, i got a pimple... this stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... like it really works, ya know...
i tell you something, anne.  i really feel like I am cursed.
oh stop.  things will change.  my aunt mary always said, there is a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
i get this feeling like i'm... a magnet but i attract shit.  out of all the people in this city, why did i meet a man who is wife i killed?
you did not kill anybody.  stop.
i wish there was some way i could... just... pay the fine and go home.
can i help you?
i'm... just looking for parry...
he is not here.
"soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee"....
parry!
do you follow her every day?
huh-huh. I am deeply smitten.
what is her name?
i do not know.
why did you do that?
well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, i think they might alter their behavior. what do you think jack...
here...i just would like to help you. i thought...maybe...you could use some money.
fifty dollars?
here's another twenty. will that do?  i mean, what is it going to take!
no..no, it's..i do not know what to say. this is so nice of you...jack...
that is o.k.
can i take you to lunch?
no..i have to get back to work. take care of yourself.
well, i think you should be realistic. ya can not start an ad agency on fifty dollars!
what are you doing?  give that back!
but i gave it to you!
well what am i gonna do with it?
i do not know. but i gave it to you...to help you...not him.
you really want to help me?
pretty impressive huh?...don't let it scare you. I will admit it is formidable but everything has it is weakness.
you can not just break into langdon carmichael's house. this man has done nothing.
o.k...let me explain this one more time...the holly grail is in -....
all right! listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when i tell you this but - you should not do this..there is no holy grail.
of course there is, jack. what do you think the crusades were - a frat initiation? i do not think so...there has to be a grail.
look, you are only sort of insane, really. people like you can lead semi-normal lives. you could get a job...
i do not need a job. i have a quest.
i take it back - you are fucking deranged... and you are going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
tch. you are so sweet...now i know why you are saying this. ...you're afraid I am in danger and you are trying to protect me.
no. i think you are a moron and i do not want to get into trouble.
...you are such a great guy. first the money, now this.  is not he fabulous!?
please do not hug me in public again, o.k.?
i love this man...ya hear me jaded city...  ...i'm daffy about this guy and i do not care who knows it!!!
will you shut-up!!!
you are a true friend.
I am not. believe me. i'm scum.
you are a real honest to goodness good guy.
I am self-centered, I am weak - i do not have the will power of a fly on shit...
that is why the little people sent you. just like magic.
i do not believe in little floating people! there is no magic!
so what? you going to help me?
will you please... please listen to me ...  you know none of this is true -                           parry the grail, the voices...                           jack... there is a part of you that                         come on...what are knows this is not true.                             saying... i know who you are...                              i know who you are.. or who you were.                                   you are acting really- you do not belong on the                            no, no, no, no... streets. you are intelligent                        jack... man....you're a teacher...                         jacck!... you were a teach at hunter college. do not you remember?...
he knows who you are!  he is afraid!  i can tell!
you are totally gone, are not you?
is not it great up here... he is gone now, but we had him on the run! we would have had his ass if we had horses! he is running scared!
who! who is running?!! who have we been chasing!?? can i ask this question now!!!
saw who!!?
the red knight!
the red...?  you are totally gone, are not you?
it is o.k...it's o.k...lets me help you up.
no...i wanna go! i wanna go now!
come on now...you can not sit here.
no! i want a debutante on a horse to step on me.  leave me alone!!
parry...
buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.
is not that awful? poor brenda frazier. poor little gloria. they ruined them! they ate them alive!
it was a crime.
leave me alone...i wanna go...
listen, he just needs to sleep it off. someone will take care of him.
who?
well, maybe he wants to stay here.  do...do you want to stay here?
i wanna go...just let me go...
uh...where...where do you want to go?
a real nice place i know... ah...can't get there! not tonight.
where?  maybe we can.
no...no...we can't...we can't..
come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
venice...like katherine hepburn in summertime. . ....why can not i be katherine hepburn...
can you tell me something? did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
well,... I am a singer by trade... summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...it used to be what i absolutely lived for...god...i can do gypsy backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  that, and the fact that all my friends are dead...god, i sound like a veteran. dad would be so proud.
um...i've got to run. I have bee doing this all day.  are you going to be all right?
oh please!...i was born a catholic in brooklyn... I have been to hell and back.... I will be fine...  ....thanks...you're a gem.
it is such a great song.
it is a classic.
do not you think it is time to go now? running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
well that is stupid. this is my park just as much as it is theirs. you think it is fair they keep us out just because they make us think we will get killed or something?
yes. i think that is very fair.
.....what are you doing?
have you ever done any cloudbusting? you lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. it is wild.
you can not do this! this is new york! nobody lies in naked in a field in new york..it's...it's too midwestern.
come on, try it. ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we are bare assed in the middle of it. come on!
no! i will not! this is nuts! I am leaving! i mean it...this is nuts.  this is too nuts...i'm leaving. i mean it!
..ha...little fella? i mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he is naked in the middle of central park. i should be surprised? I am not surprised. I am fucking outta my mind to even be here!
who are you talking to jack?
you are out of your fucking mind!!
bingo!
are there any questions?
what?
then let's begin with the story itself. it is a story of the grail myth...and although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the fisher king as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. out of the fire, appears the holy grail - god's highest symbol of divine grace. and a voice says to the boy, "you shall be the guardian of the grail, that it may heal the hearts of men"...but the boy was overcome ...innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. a boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like god...  ...and so he reached into the fire to take the grail. and the grail vanished. and the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. when he became king, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the grail... but with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... he became a bitter man. life for him lost it is reason. with each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...until finally, the king lost all faith in god's existance and in man's value...he lost his ability to love or be loved and he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. as the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the grail that would heal their king and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail.  pretty soon, finding the grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the king's power, which only confirmed the king's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. his only hope, he thought, was death. then one day, a fool was brought in to the king to cheer him.  he was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... he tells the king some jokes...sing him some songs, but the king feels even worse...finally, the fool says, "what is it that hurts you so much? how can i help?"...and the king says, "i need a sip of water to cool my throat"...so, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the king...suddenly, the king feels a lot better. and when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the holy grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...and the king asks, "how can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find"? and the fool answers, "i do not know. i only knew you were thirsty."... and for the first time since he was a boy, the king felt more than a man - not because he was touched by god's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool.
i can not ask for her...i have to earn her.
parry, you do not have to earn a woman. it is the twentieth century.
maybe, when we get the grail...
well, see, i think she can help...you know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...i mean, where would arthur be without guinevere...
happily married, probably.
bad example. just trust me. a woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... makes you feel like you can do anything...
is that what your girlfriend does for you?
sure...
could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
what girl?  i did not notice.
uh... she was wearing a kind of... a flouncy kind of... uh... plain...
oh, lydia!
lydia.  lydia what?
god, i have no idea.  she is worked here for fifteen years and i have no idea.  I will call her.
no... no... that is all right... i thought i knew her... thanks...
can i have my desk please.
hello, I would like to speak to lydia?
lydia?!  lydia who!?
i do not know her last name... I will be off in a second.
you are calling lydia in my office. you must think I am some dope.  you fuckin' bastard... you...  ... stay out all night long...
what... no... lydia... i want to speak to... her name is lydia... i...uh...
... i do not get a friggin' phone call.  you stroll in here at noon.  i got... two people out sick.  ya think i need this?  i do not need this!
...forget it... goodbye!
i was not with a woman last night.  i was out with parry.
the moron?
he is not a moron.
and who is lydia?
lydia is the girl parry likes... and i thought, if i could get them together i...
what?  the curse'll be lifted?  will you please!
i... you are not going to understand this.
do not treat me like I am stupid.  it pisses me off.
all right... sorry... i feel indebted to him.
what does that mean?
see, i told you!
well, what the hell does that mean?
i thought... if... if i can help him in some way... you know?... get him this girl he loves... then... maybe.... things'll start changing for me... my luck, ya know... maybe...  forget it... it is a stupid idea.
hello lydia?
yeah?  who is this?
yes.
yes well...  you are a credit card holder, are you not?
huh-huh.
well, congratulations lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
which ones?
all of them... which means you have just won a free membership at our store on second avenue.
your name was picked.
well, i do not understand.  what did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
a list.
well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
well there....  what is the difference?
well, i mean... i do not know you... this has never... I have never won anything and... i do not have a vcr.
you get a vcr with the membership.  ... for a short time until you get your own.  listen, why do not you come down to the store and you can check it out.  see if you are interested.
did phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
no!  i told you! you won a contest!
remember. one chorus and out.
I am a man with a mission, jack.
hello. my name is lydia sinclair.
yes. hi..congratulations. jack lucas. nice to meet you finally. this is anne napolitano, the owner of video spot.
hello....congratulations.
and this is our other..uh...co-worker.. parry..uh...parry....
parry parry?
no just parry.
oh...like moses.
so how do we do this?
well..um...you get an official membership card...  just sign that and we will laminate it right here... parry?  you want to laminate miss sinclair's card?...
this will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
but now it is free, right?
yeah.
now what?
uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
free?
yes.  they are free.
how about the "hell merchants"?
i do not like horror movies!
how about... zbiegnew speizak's "the purple bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a polish bakery.  in subtitles.
i do not like... uh...  polish love stories...  ... i like musicals.
well, we have plenty of those.  right over here.  we got the mgm series, astaire and rogers, the judy garlands...
got any ethel merman?
... uh... we seem to be all out of ethel merman.
what a gyp.
yeah.
you know, i think i... ordered some just the other day.
well did you or did not you?
yes!  they will be in soon.
well, i guess I will come back then.
i like your nails.  where did you get them done?
ah... i do them myself.  i used to work in a beauty parlor.
you know, anne does other people too. sort of a sideline...
how much?
well, since you are a member, we could...
okay... twenty dollars... when can you...
tonight!  how is tonight?
getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and him... she did not even look at him.
got any more bread crust?
i do not know... he is a little disgusting... although some women go for that.
he just needs some clothes?
i mean, I have gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  it is the only reason to go out with a bum.
this food's delicious.  you are a wonderful cook.  and you have a lovely home.
jack, he is starting a conversation...
well talk back.  he will not bite you.
thank you very much.
you're surprised!... but i guess i just never met the right guy.  whatta going to do?
I am shocked.  with a child bearing body like yours...  ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
most men are.
why this is outrageous!...
holdin' my penis... what a lovely way of sayin' how much ya like me...
what are you, out of your mind!
holdin' my penis...
parry!  close your pants...
I have never been in an apartment above a store.  you always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
can i get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
no, thank you.
will it hurt?
that all depends on you. ...sure you do not want a drink?
...so he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...i said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... i said, there is the door - take a trip.
you threw him out?
my parents were divorced.
it is an awful thing, let me tell you. my aunt used to say,  "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".
...so...anybody special in your life?
do i look like i have someone special?
well, do not say it like that. it is not so...ya know, crazy an idea. you are a healthy woman... you hold a steady job. ya not crossed eyed or anything...
well, there is nobody special!
fine.
i mean, it is not easy in this day and age.
what?
meeting ... people.
tell me about it. I have been dating longer than I have been driving. i can not believe that.
i never really...went through a... dating period.
it is a disgusting process. you have not missed anything.
will you stand still so i can do this!
I am sorry....i'm just so excited.  you must have felt this way when you first met anne, huh? where did you two meet?
in a bar called hellfire.
tch...how romantic. yeah. if i was not already committed to lydia, boy. except anne'd never go for me though. she loves you too much. and you really love her, huh?
no. but that is not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
what are the other reasons?
...my mother calls every week. like a recurring nightmare. "so, have you met anyone?"..."no mom".. "so what is going to happen?"... "i do not know mom"... i only thank god i moved out.
i can not believe you lived with her for that long. if i had to live with my mother, I would stab myself six times.
i think some people are meant to be alone.  maybe i was a man in a former life and i used women for pleasure so now I am paying for it - which would be fine, if i could just remember some of the pleasure parts...
i do not understand you. what is the problem?
i do not feel like i make any impression on people... at office parties i spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. i do not start conversations because i have no idea how to end them...i think I am just meant to live in the background of things.
that is not true...you got to ease up... conversations have a life of their own. you got to just go with it...we're having a lovely conversation.
I am paying you.
you know, let me tell you something! I am not that kind of person. i do not do people favors. if i talk to you it is because i want to. so we are not all ...uh...jerri hall...big deal... what a boring world if we were. you do the best you can with what you got. you are not so so invisible, ya know... you want make an impression? try this; you can be a real bitch.
really?
yeah!
...i feel so much for her...i feel like something awful is going to happen.
no. nothing bad's going to happen. anne'll be there. I will be there. nothing bad will happen.
I am still scared.
parry, it is lydia sinclair - our membership winner.
i know!
what are you two up to?
well..everything's closed up. we thought we would get some dinner.  say!....anybody up for chinese?  have you eaten? would you like to come along?
oh, no..i have to get home...
the nails!! watch the nails!!...  listen, you still have to eat.
no really..i can't.
hey? what did i tell you? why do not you come? it is just dinner. you will have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
...i..uh..i get to read some of the books but mostly i..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. after paperback it is basically someone else's problem.
it sounds exciting.
why does it sound exciting? there is absolutely nothing exciting about it.
we mostly publish trashy romance novels.
well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
how do you know him?
we were neighbors for a couple for weeks on sutton place.
yep! right on it!
huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
what do you do - for a living i mean?
well, I am in search of the holy grail.
what do you think?
i think they are made for each other. and it scares me.
you know, i can not believe i did it. you think it will work out?
who is knows. my aunt marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
nothing it is just...i begining to understand you.
well...i think you should feel very proud. you did a real nice thing for somebody else. I am very proud.
you were great. thanks alot.
tell me more. i want to know everything.
there is not any more to tell.
do not say that.
no, really..believe me - there is not any more. this is it.
well, it is enough for me.
you do not have to say that.
i never say anything i have to.
i mean you do not have to say nice things to me... that kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we are about to do.
what are we about to do?
well... you are walking me home.  i... i guess you are sort of... attracted to me and you will want to come upstairs for... coffee...
i do not drink coffee...
... and then we will probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you will sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you will be distant and you will not be... able to stay for breakfast... you will just have some coffee maybe...
i do not drink coffee...
and then we will exchange phone numbers and you will leave and never call and I will go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  why am i putting myself through this?  it was very nice... uh meeting you. good night..
excuse me...
listen, I am not feeling well.
well, no wonder.  we just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and i can not even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
listen, you are very nice... b...
so are you, but i think maybe you should shut up now...  ... I am not coming up to your apartment.  that was never my idea.
oh... you mean you do not want to.
oh no, i want to.  I have got a hard-on for you the size of canada... but i don't... want just one night.  i have a confession to make?
you are married.
no.
divorced.
no, i...
you have a disease.
will you stop!...  ... I am in love with you...
... it is not just from tonight.  I have known you for a long time.  i see you come out of work every day.  i walk with you to lunch.  i know what you order... i see you buy baby ruths before going back in...  i know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore...  ... i know you hate your job and you do not have many friends and you sometimes feel like you are not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you are a little uncoordinated  ... and feeling like you are the only one who is as separate and... alone as you are... and i love you.   i love you.  i think you are the greatest thing since... spice racks and i would be knocked out several times if i even got just a first kiss.  but I will be back in the morning.  and i will not be distant.  and i will call if you let me... but i still do not drink coffee.
shhh...
so what is going on?  who is lou again?
my agent.  i called my agent.
you are kidding!  what did he say?
he says if i want to get back to work, no problem.  he wants me to come in and talk and... and... that's it!
whoah!  oh, honey, that is terrific!
I have got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... oh, i should get my sports jacket cleaned...  ... there is coffee if you want...
you made coffee?... you are going back to work and you made coffee?... i love this!
it is so great to see you like this, honey... i can not tell you.
thanks.
ya know, I am thinkin' -- with another income coming in, i would love to get a bigger place.
ugh, these tapes are a mess.  i do not know where to begin...
... i would love to start looking at least.  you know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in brooklyn or staten island...
... what?... you do not want to commute?
no, it is not... come here...
what?
"i'm an incredible woman?"  what is this, a death sentence?
no, i... i think we should talk about this.
you want to talk?  come on, jack... did i cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
no... it is just...
... listen, so much has happened and i think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
slowed things down?  where have i been?  have we been going fast!?
right now, I am just not sure about... making such definite plans.
... I would like to focus on my career - - now than i can, now that everything's all right... parry's taken care of... and... like i said, i feel like i know a lot more now and i don't...
first of all, let me tell you something -- you do not know shit. second of all, as far as we go, what time do you need?  what have we been doing here, except time?  have i ever... ever pressured you!?
no.
no.  so what time do you need?  i love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great!  I would like to be a part of it -- i think i deserve that!  so what do you need to figure out alone!?
you can not even give me that?!  what were you going to do, jack?... just going to organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  what were you planning to do, jack?
i did not know.  i just said all i want is some time.
bullshit!  if you are going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you do not have the balls!
all right... I will pack my stuff tonight.
what have you been doing here!  huh! i wanna know!  what have you been doing here?!
listen!  we both got something out of it, all right!
oh yeah?  what did i get?  what did i get i couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  you think your company is such a treat?  your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... you think you are entertaining?
then what do you want to stay with me for?
parry?
he can not hear you.  hi...i'm dr. weintraub....  i was on duty when they brought him in...i've been going over his record... he was brought in once before i understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
yeah so? the guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right?  he will snap out of it?
I am afraid not ... then again, I am not sure. the beating's bad but it is not the problem... it seems he's.. re-experiencing the catatonia... so, like before, he could snap out it in an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years... ....i do not know. there is no way to tell.
but..how could that happen?
well, it is not unusual in his case... sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain's replay system. the brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. a person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long after the event took place. are you relatives?  well, it does not matter. we will take care of it. he will have to be sent back to the same institution..
what if i was a relative?
you would have the option to care for him at home but my advice is it would not be the best thing for him. he needs hospital care. i just thought you could sign the release forms, but the city can do that. i would not feel responsible in any way. there is really nothing you can do. I am sorry.
well!  what do you want me to do - applaud?
how have you been?
terrific. going on alot of dates ... seeing lots of men... lots of dates..
i think.. i...i realized...i love you.
huh-huh....you son of a bitch!
beautiful night huh?
yeah.....hey they are moving....  am i doing that?
