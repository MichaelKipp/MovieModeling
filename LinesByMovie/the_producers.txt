ta.  ta.
ta.  ta.
uh ... uh ... ooooooops?
who are you?  what do you want? why are you loitering in my hallway? speak, dummy, speak!  why do not you speak?
scared.  can not talk.
all right.  get a hold of yourself. take a deep breath, let it out slowly and tell me who you are.
I am leo bloom, I am an accountant, I am from whitehall and marks, i was sent here to do your books and I am terribly sorry i caught you with the old lady.
yes sir.
then account for yourself!  do you believe in god?  do you believe in gold?  why are you looking up old lady's dresses?  bit of a pervert, eh?
but sir, I am not condem ...
shut up.  I am having a rhetorical conversation.  how humiliating.  max bialystock. max bialystock.
you have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  one ... two ...
do the books!  do the books!
yes, sir.  thank you.
window's so filthy, can not tell if it is day or night out there.
look at that.  a white rolls royce. that is it baby, when you got it, flaunt it.
koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ...
i assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  am i correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people?
i have hurt your feelings.
good, what is it?
sir, may i speak to you for a minute?
go!  you have fifty-eight seconds.
well, sir, it seems ...
you have forty-eight seconds left. hurry.  hurry.
in looking at your books, I have discovered that ...
twenty-eight seconds, hurry, hurry, you are using up your time.
what is that?  a handkerchief?
it is nothing ... nothing.
here, do not panic.
I am sorry ... i do not like people touching my blue blanket.  it is not important.  it is a minor compulsion. i can deal with it if i want to. it is just that I have had it ever since i was a baby and ... and ... i find it very comforting.
they come here.  they all come here. how do they find me?
mr. bialystock ...
yes, prince mishkin, what can we do for you?
this is hardly a time for levity. I have discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
where?  what?
according to the backer's list you raised $60,000.  but the show you produced only cost fifty-eight thousand.  there is two thousand dollars unaccounted for.
i went to a turkish bath, who cares? the show was a flop.  what difference does it make?
it makes a great deal of difference. that is fraud.  if they found out, you could go to prison.
why should they find out?  it is only two thousand dollars,  bloom, do me a favor, move a few decimal points around.  you can do it. you are an accountant.  the word 'count' is part of your title.
but that is cheating!
it is not cheating ... it is charity. bloom, look at me ... look at me! I am drowning.  other men sail through life.  bialystock has struck a reef.  bloom, I am going under.  i am being sunk by a society that demands success, when all i can offer is failure.  bloom, I am reaching out to you.  do not send me to jail.  help!  help!
help!
all right.  I will do it.  I will do it.
thank you, bloom.  i knew i could con you.
oh, it is all right ... wha?
nothing.  nothing.  do it.  do it.
now let's see, two thousand dollars. that is not much.  I am sure i can hide it somewhere.  after all, the department of internal revenue is not interested in a show that flopped.
yes.  right.  good thinking.  you figure it out.  I am tired.  I am going to take a little nap.  wake me if there is a fire.
now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
yes, what?
what you were saying.  keep talking.
what was i saying?
you were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit.
yes, it is quite possible.
you keep saying that, but you do not tell me how.  how could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit?
assume away!
well, it is very easy.  you simply raise more money than you really need.
what do you mean?
you have done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
what did i do?
you raised two thousand more than you needed to produce your last play.
so what?  what did it get me?  I am wearing a cardboard belt.
ahhhhhh!  but that is where you made your error.  you did not go all the way.  you see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
but the play only cost $60,000 to produce.
exactly.  and how long did it run?
one night.
see?  you could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
but what if the play was a hit?
oh, you would go to jail.  if the play were a hit, you would have to pay off the backers, and with so many backers there could never be enough profits to go around, get it?
aha, aha, aha, aha, aha, aha!!  so, in order for the scheme to work, we would have to find a sure fire flop.
what scheme?
what scheme?  your scheme, you bloody little genius.
oh, no.  no.  no.  i meant no scheme.  i merely posed a little, academic accounting theory.  it is just a thought.
bloom, worlds are turned on such thoughts!
mr. bialystock.  no.  wait.  please. you are holding me too tight.  I am an honest man.  you do not understand.
no, bloom, you do not understand. this is fate, this is destiny. there is no avoiding it.
mr. bialystock, not more than five minutes ago, against my better judgment, i doctored your books. that, sir, is the ultimate extent of my criminal life.
oh, i fell on my keys.  I have got to get out of here.
you miserable, cowardly, wretched little caterpillar.  do not you ever want to become a butterfly?  do not you want to spread your wings and flap your way to glory?
you are going to jump on me.
you are going to jump on me.  i know you are going to jump on me -- like nero jumped on poppea.
what???
poppea.  she was his wife.  and she was unfaithful to him.  so he got mad and he jumped on her.  up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  please do not jump on me.
I am not going to jump on you!
aaaaaaaaaa!
will you get a hold on yourself.
do not touch me!  do not touch me!
what are you afraid of?  I am not going to hurt you!  what is the matter with you?
I am hysterical.  I am having hysterics.  I am hysterical.  i can not stop.  when i get like this, i can not stop.  I am hysterical.
what can i do?  what can i do? you are getting me hysterical.
go away from me.  you frighten me.  sit over there.
okay.  I am way over here.  is that better?
it is a little better, but you still look angry.
how is this?
good.  good.  that is nice.  that is very nice.  i think I am coming out of it now.  yes.  yes.  I am definitely coming out of it.  thank you for smiling.  it helped a great deal.
well, you know what they say, "smile and the world smiles with you."  heh, heh.  the man should be in a straight jacket.  feeling better?
much, thank you.  but i am a little lightheaded.  maybe i should eat something.  hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know.
they certainly do.  they certainly do.  come, let me take you to lunch.
that is very kind of you, mr. bialystock, but i ...
i got it, mr. bialystock.
thank you, leo.  and call me max. you know, i do not let everybody call me max.  it is only people i really like.
okay ... max!  and you can call me leo.
i already have.  come on.
oh.
where would you like to eat?
well, max, i do not know, max.  what do you think, max?
let me see ... it is such a beautiful day.  why waste it indoors.  I have got it!  let's go to coney island! we will lunch at the sea shore.
coney island??
what is the matter, leo?  do not you like coney island?
i ... i love it.  i have not been there since i was a kid.  but it is nearly two o'clock.  i really should be getting back to whitehall and marks.
nonsense!  as far as whitehall and marks are concerned, you are working with bialystock, right?
right.
then stick with bialystock!
what kind now, leo?
i do not know.  let's see.  we have had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
two pistachios, my good man.
everybody's a big shot.  well, leo, are you having a good time?
i do not know.  i think so.  i feel very strange.
maybe you are happy.
yes.  that is it.  happy.  well, whatta ya think of that.  happy.
you think you are not in prison now? living in a grey little room. going to a grey little job.  leading a grey little life.
you are right.  you are absolutely right.  I am a nothing.  i spend my life counting other people's money -- people I am smarter than, better than.  where is my share? where is leo bloom's share?  i want, i want, i want, i want everything I have ever seen in the movies!
you bet your boots, leo.  it is bialystock and bloom -- on the rise. upward and onward.  say, you will join me.  nothing can stop us.
I will do it!  by god, I will do it!
this is where we belong, leo.  on top of the world.  top of the world!
you can not feel it when it is in your hand, when it is in your pocket.
max, what is it?  what are you doing?  what is happening?
I will tell you what is happening. we have struck gold.  not fool's gold, but real gold.  the mother lode.  the mother lode.  the mother of them all.
you found a flop!
a flop, ha!  that is putting it mildly.  a disaster!  a catastrophe! an outrage!  a guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty!
it will not run a week!
run a week?  are you kidding?  this play has got to close in the first act.
who wrote it?
i vas never a member of the nazi party.  i am not responsible.  i only followed orders.  who are you?
mr. liebkind, wait.  you do not understand.
vhy do you persecute me?  my papers are in order.  i love my country.  "oh, beautiful for spacious skies, for amber vaves of grain."
mr. liebkind, wait ...
"i'm a yankee doodle dandy ...
mr. liebkind, relax, relax, we are not from the government.  we came here to talk to you about your play.
my play?  you mean, "springtime for ... " you know who?
yes.
vat about it?
we loved it.  we thought it was a masterpiece.  that is why we are here. we want to produce it on broadway.
you are not, as you americans say, dragging my leg, are you?
no, not at all sir, we are quite serious.  we want to produce your play.  i have the contracts right here.
oh joy of joys!  oh, dream of dreams!  i can not believe it.  birds, birds, do you hear?  otto, bertz, heintz, hans, wolfgang, do you hear?  ve are going to clear the fuhrer's name.  fly, fly, spread the words.
"deutchland, deutchland, uber alles, uber alles in der velt."
"deutchland, deutchland ... "
mr. liebkind, mr. liebkind.
vat?
people can hear you.
oh.  "i'm a yankee doodle dandy, yankee doodle is my ... " listen, this is not place to talk.  come!
i vas vit him a great deal, you know.
with whom?
vit the fuhrer, of course.  he liked me.  out of all the household staff at berchtesgarten, i vas his favorite.  i vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime.
no kidding?
oh, sure.  i used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  achhh, those were the days.  vat good times ve had.  dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  you know, not many people knew about it, but the fuhrer vas a terrific dancer.
really, i never dreamed ...
that is because you were taken in by that verdampter allied propaganda. such filthy lies.  but nobody said a bad vord about winston churchill, did they?  oh no, vin vit vinnie!  churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. could not even say nazi.  he would say narzis, narzis.  ve vere not narzies, ve vere nazis.  but let me tell this, and you are getting it straight from the horse, hitler vas better looking than churchill, he vas a better dresser than churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off churchill!
that is exactly why we want to do this play.  to show the world the true hitler, the hitler you knew, the hitler you loved, the hitler with a song in his heart.
wait.  no.  how do i know i can trust you?  how do i know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived?
we swear it!
not good enough... vould you be villing to take the siegfried oath?
yes.  we would!
good.  i will make the preparations.
max, i do not want to take any siegfried oath.  i do not know what it is, but i do not want to take it. we might end up in the german army.
shut up, you idiot.  he is a harmless nut.  play along with him.  it is almost in the bag.
i solemnly swear...

mrs. eleanor biddlecombe.  she also owns 50% of the profits.
mrs. virginia resnick.  she also owns 50% of the profits.
mrs. alma wentworth.  she owns 100% of the profits.
leo, what if this play is a hit?
then the department of justice owns 100% of bialystock and bloom.
oi.  I am depressed.  leo, do me a favor.  open the safe.  i want to see the money.
what are you doing?
I am going to buy a toy.  i worked very, very hard and i think i deserve a toy.
yes.  she is an adult, educational toy made in sweden for children over fifty.
stop looking at me like that. she is not an indulgence.  she happens to be our new receptionist. she goes with our new surroundings.
ulla, I would like you to meet my partner and associate, mr. leo bloom.
got dag pa dig.
how do you do.  have you gone mad?  a receptionist that can not speak english.  what will people say?
they will say, "oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh."
what is she gonna do here?
I will show you.  ulla, go to work.
bialystock and blum.  bialystock and blum.  bialystock and blum. got dag pa dig.  bialystock and blum.
hey, blum, have a cigar.
min bialystock.
nice girl.
max, as i was saying, maybe we should go easy on the spending.  i mean these offices and everything.
why?  take it when you can get it! flaunt it, baby, flaunt it!
but if something should... god forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  it would look better in court.
stop talking like that, you white mouse!  nothing's going to go wrong. as a matter of fact, today i have taken steps to insure total disaster. at two of the clock we have an appointment with none other than roger de bris.
roger de bris.  roger de bris.  oh yes, the director.  is he good... i mean bad?
roger de bris is the worst director that ever lived.
do you think he will take the job?
only if we ask him.
come on.  we would better hurry.  we are late.
call chauffeur.  get car.
good.  good.  we go motel.
no.  we go.
you, blum go motel.
no.  no motel.  get car.  get car.
get car.  get car.
very nice girl.
well, it's... uh... it is nice and long... i mean, it's... uh... uh... where do you keep your wallet?
it is gorgeous.  absolutely gorgeous. you could not have picked a better color.  it brings out your eyes. let's face it, roger, that dress is you.
how would you like to go back to teasing hair, big mouth?
roger, do you mind if we talk a little business?
please, please, that is what we are here for.  be careful, that hurt.
i think this would be a marvelous opportunity for you, roger.  up to now, you have always been associated with musicals, and...
yes.  dopey show-girls in gooey gowns.  two-three-kick-turn!  turn- turn-kick-turn!  it is enough to make you throw up!  at last a chance to do straight drama!  to deal with conflict, with inner truth.  roger de bris presents history.  of course, i think we should add a little music.  that whole third act has got to go. they are losing the war.  it is too depressing.  we will have to put something in there.  aaahghhh!  i see it!  a line of beautiful girls, dressed as storm troopers, black patent leather boots, all marching together... two-three-kick-turn!  turn-turn- kick-turn!
that is genius.  that is genius. roger, i think i speak for mr. bloom and myself when i say that you are the only man in the world who can do justice to springtime for hitler.
wait a minute.  this is a very big decision.  it might effect the course of my entire life.  I will have to think about it.  I will do it.
congratulations.
get on the phone.  send out a casting call.  call every agent in town.  i want to see everybody. everybody.
you think out of all those hitlers you could find just one...
it was the same thing in germany. we looked for years before we found the right hitler.
wait!  this is boomerang.  this is boomerang.
what are you saying?
let's hear him.  what have we got to lose?  what is your name?
lorenzo saint dubois.  but everybody calls me lsd.
what have you done, lsd?
six months, I am out on probation, but it is cool now, baby.
i mean in show business.
oh, in show business.  well, let's put it this way, my next job will be my debut.
what do you do best?
hey, man, i can not do that here, that is what they put me away for.
oh, sing.  sing!
hey, baby, that is where they put me, sing-sing.  how did you know that, you been up?
sing a song!  just sing a song!
vaaaat???
franz, do not you see, hitler was a man of his time.  this is a man of his time.
but he has long hair!
do not look at the outside, look at the inside.  it is the inner hitler we are after.  the young beautiful hitler, who danced his way to glory.
i do not know.  i do not know.
franz, trust me.  i promise i will not let you down.
all right, but remember, if you damage the fuhrer's reputation, i kill you.
so much for nutsy fagin.

why do not we go over to the theatre and see what is really happening? after all, we have only heard from a small portion of the audience. let's hear what the majority thinks.
the majority.  the majority.  yes. let's hear from the majority.
we are falling back on all fronts. our soldiers are retreating.
