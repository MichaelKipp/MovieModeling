hey little bear, are not you going to join the others?
um, my allergist told me not to engage in physically demanding activities where ragweed or spores might be present, sir.
do you have a note to corroborate these claims?
um, well...
are you lying to me?
well...
what did we say about lying?
I am not lying.
you know that no one likes a liar, right?
i said I am not lying.
what have you done now, broke the darn thing?
i just hit it like you said.
one keg of beast for the basement, then, truck's dry.
gonna stay for a couple?
what is that!? wha'cha say? huh?
get outta here.
this one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
whoa!
hey! get quiet or get out.
c'mon guys--
got 'cha!
hold that tight!
is it clear?!
yeah.
is there a gun pointing at you?
nah, i got the gun.
my god damn foot is gone! who fuckin' shot me? who fuckin' shot me!?
her fella.
my husband...
well, where is the sonuvabitch!?
he is dead.
what?
jesus christ on the cross... someone make sense.
easy. we are surrounded by something the likes none of you have ever seen before. some kind of animals. real fast, volatile, predators. one went through three of your patrons like they were kleenex.
so, your dead hubby shot me twice, three of my customers have been eaten, and there are angry creatures outside?
he only shot you once.
huh?
he shot you the other time.
oh my god... what is that?
that is one piece of four problems.
that is the oldest of the bunch, looked like the grandpapa. we caught the little one, junior, in the cooler there. as we have seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
and the rest of 'em?
unfortunately, the worst of 'em are still outside.
if you are face to face with her, dive left.
and the last one is the...
father. the biggest, the strongest...
cody! cody are you all right? mommy's coming! mommy's coming, baby! do not move! mommy's coming!
stop her!
oh sweetheart! what was i thinking? mommy is never gonna let you go. oh jesus... never, ever, never let you go.
let's lock off this room.
so, what now? did those things leave?
why do not you go check it out?
fuck no.
you can not keep me here. this is bullshit. fuckin' bullshit. this is fucking bullshit!
we can not risk letting them in.
right.
any more ideas animal planet?
you were not helpin'.
go douche.
well, it do not look pretty.
but it is got teeth.
will these boards hold?
the boards are solid oak planks, and the floor is reinforced by a steel grid beneath. nothing real or supernatural is busting through this, least nothing the size of the beasts.
good.
and that is how i ended up here.
and the head?
so, your husband ditched you?
no, no, no it was... it was wild out there, no time to think, we just moved. he did not leave me. he just ran.  he just ran.
well, justice is funny.
do we have anything else to defend ourselves with? anything?
right. were going to need some fire power.  do you have any sort of guns or ammunition here? anything at all?
i got my .38 here. that is six shots and two refills. downstairs, i think we got another rifle, maybe a scatterer and some gardening tools. maybe a couple boxes of shells for the judge.
i got shells too, box and a half, tops.
okay, well that is something.
so we have got guns, kitchen knives, pipes, fire and sticks.
you young'uns worry about weapons, I am thinkin' bout strategy.
oh? and what is that?
sit still, look less like a meal.
i think that is for bears and sharks, chunky chew.
well, maybe they migrate?
as long as it is dark, they are around. they hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
i would not do that, son.
they are probably on to the next buffet by now. there is a retirement home up the road. they would be easy.
careful.
I am telling you, i do not see a thing --
'eh, chief?
duh hickey.
in the kitchen, under the sink.
no one goes anywhere alone. least of all, unarmed.
hey!
everyone take a role. let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. we also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  so, who is going into the basement with me?
i do not think you should...
with what just happened upstairs --
shut up! shut your mouth. you have no idea what is running through me right now. no idea.  I am ready.
all right.
I am telling ya, you got the cloth too deep, you are asking for it.
oh yeah?
you do not want the rag to touch the booze, that way you can hold it awhile and ensure it explodes when you throw it.
you sure? i thought the rag had to touch?
I am sure.
there is a rifle and a shotgun here.
that is fine.
why do you take shit from him?
look, yeah, he is an ass, but he is my brother. que sera-sera.
your brother, huh?
yep.
your parents of relation?
we lived near power lines.
how are you holding up?
well...
push and twist, it is child proof.
oh.
gimme a couple dabs on the tongue.
what is this?
magic potion.  you should try a little.
oh, no.
it will calm your nerves. works like a charm.
really?
uh huh. just put a dab on your tongue.
will i go crazy or something?
no, no, it calms you, makes everything nice and smooth. just takes the edge off like a beer, but in a fraction of the time.
why not then?
wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, i need to lay down. there is a cot back there.
but --
it is much safer in there, sweety.
okay then.
it serves you right. you cheatin' jerk.
spare me.
i figure it is karma. you wronged me and you wronged your wife and you wronged your children, so this is karma biting you on the ass, or in your case...  ...on the eye.
you know you do not have to do this.
I am fine, i really am.
i admire your strength.
we all have to be strong, right?
right.
her name is charlie.
oh...
she is still alive, i hope. i would not have made it this far if it were not for the chance of seeing my little girl again. i need to get to her.
I will do anything to help.
i know. thanks. just do not tell anyone i have a soft side.
deal.
does not your foot hurt?
i can not feel a thing, hon.
um-hmmm.
the girl's got rhythm.
you wanna see, baby?
sure.
how much you got?
how much i got, what?
how much you got to see the show?
you do not understand sweety, daddy does not pay, daddy sees the show for free. but you do get points for being horny on a night like this.
what? really?
uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on daddy's face, i wanna do some appraising.
i have a cb in my truck, we could get some help out here.
who the hell would you call?
anyone.
do you drive a short beer bus or something? you go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. do not you see a pattern here, spuds makenzie?
well then i guess we should just give up.
believe me, I would love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. but it is not in the cards, partner.
i think i know where a cb is.
where is that?
upstairs.
go for it. it is by the far wall. a small wave band. channel 9 is the emergency frequency. but i do not see the point.
you are wasting your time, there is no one out there.
fine, chief.
gimme the keys.
no, but i will lock you in.
what?
we will be on the other side waiting for you. if you become food i do not want the only set of keys in the belly of one of those things. it is your funeral.
we are better off.
who is with me?
I will go with ya.
what are you going to do? throw your teeth at 'em? sit down, cocoon.
you are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
well, we are one miracle short tonight. so, just guard the stairs?
done. but you are locked in.  will you hold the keys?
they are right here.
hey!
what?!
move slow and move quiet.
no shit.
move it!
you keep that key handy.
shit!
I am fine! I am fine!
okay, now. easy steps. easy breaths. easy steps.
come on, come on.
jesus christ, I am going to have a stroke.
easy.
just a bat! I am fine! just a bat! sorry!
if he does not shut up...
hurry!
repeat. we need help. sos. calling all cars! we need help at the united nations tav--!
shit.
move your ass!
oh!
"oh!?" what is "oh?" what does "oh" mean?
wha?
open the door!
come on!
hellllllllp!!
okay, well... anybody else have an idea?
is there any other way out of this place? anyone?
what?
what?
what do you mean what?
huh?
what is going on between you two?
nothing.
do not bullshit me! if you know a way out of this place and you are holding out --
there is a tunnel.
what tunnel? where?
it is in the basement, about a hundred yards long. it spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. there is a truck there.
what is it for?
what is it for!?
grass. i grow some pot down there. it is no big deal, just something i dabble in. the truck's for a quick get away, deliveries, whatever.
is it gassed up?
fully.
four door?
two.
open?
covered.
how many?
holds four.
max?
seven.
nine?
seven.
keys.
what!? so you can just get the hell outta here and forget about all of us!? no way! that is my god damn truck!
let me make this clear; if we stay, we die!
i do not trust you. no way! i pick who goes! and I am holding you responsible.
you are trusting that guy? he will ditch us and never look back.
fuck you too.
get in line!
hey! no, I am not trusting him either, that is why you and i will both be going with him.
what!? I am not going down there again!
this is it! this is our only way out! they have this place surrounded. we go out the front, we are dead. we go out the back, we are dead, but if we go under them... we might just make it.  now, who else is in? seven can go.
this is a bottleneck waiting to happen.
I am in.
anyone else?
we are going to get help.
we gotta try.
anybody else?
yeah, I will go.
ok. let's see what happens.
you all sure about this?
follow me.
where is the tunnel?
in the corner, behind the curtain.
what is wrong?
nothing, just lookin'.
scared?
no. you?
of course not. i fight monsters all the time.
I would love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
the door... on three.
let's go.
she is not very nice, is she?
hold it!
whoa!
ohhh.
what?
look.
we just smeared a skunk.
shit!
we gotta be close.
what?
let's move.
I am done drinking. that is it. just church and grocery stores. nothin' else.
stop it.
hey. you noticed that no one's been killed or maimed for awhile?
that is an unwise thing to say, you know that?
just an observation.
well, why do not you keep your observations to yourself?
don't!
you will hit us!
let's go!
wait god-dammit!
I am going to shoot him if they do not get him first.
just move!
come on!
he is dead.
stop!
what the fuck are you doing he is in there!
they can not get in here!  you said it yourself, they will get in!
i will not die because of him!
do not be stupid, drop the gun!
you are killing him!
they will get in! we will all die!
welcome back.
f-f-fuck you.
they were all over the place.
you smell like ass!
we shot a skunk.
we are lucky to be alive.
yeah, maybe.
get something on that.
what now, geronimo?
my truck.
help meee!
bonsai!
all right!  tell us about the truck!
uh, uh, i think if we can get everyone into it... we can get out of here.
let's wait it out.
they will tear this place down within the hour.
my truck can not be more than ten feet away. we load into the back, i can get in the front and we roll out of here.
what is in the back?
nothing, this was my last delivery.
if there is only one way out for us, there is only one way in for them.
make a distraction out front and go for it out the back. there is cars back there, right?
yeah, the lot's right there. my truck is right out back.
but not flush against the tunnel?
look, the armed surround the unarmed in a circle and we move as a tight group. those that can shoot, protect the rest to his ride.
hey, when this plan completely goes to shit, what are ya gonna do?
you got something better?
if we move in a group, we are one target. if we scatter, they can not get us all.
bullshit.
no bullshit.
we will be food, dickheads!
well, your last words can be "i told you so."
you gotta be with me on this.
I am in a wheelchair, the truck sounds pretty good.
amazing you made it this far.
it is imperative that you get that truck moving.
just cover me. it was built to move.
where the hell are we going to go then, billy jack!?
there is a bomb shelter over in durant, by the iga, on first. you all know where that is?
you seem mighty collected about this.
buddy, I am a full-blooded chucktow. i can not think of a time my people have not been takin' it dry. the fact that we are being eaten now, does not even faze me...  ...this is just another tuesday.
clever fuckers.
what the hell's going on here!?
we should go! we should go right now!
he is right, let's move. be quiet and get to the exit. pair up, grab the weapons.
nothin' will happen to you. you get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
am i too heavy for you?
do not worry, you will be like my little papoose.
we should stick together out there.
I would love to.
go! go!
not without you!!!
go!!!
blow the goddamn hatch!
clear!
get to your cars!
go-go-go!!
oh jesus!
helllppp!
did we make it?
i think --
are you two all right? did you see that!? they left! we made it! i think we made it!
they will be back.
oh, come on! can not you be happy for one split second? they are gone!
you know where it is?
um, yeah, thirty miles east.
we will meet in three hours?
i do not wanna go home alone... i do not wanna see what might have...
where are you two going?
we are going to get my little girl.
sorry, did not mean to scare you.
where is everyone?
i do not know, i just got here. did you find your girl?
