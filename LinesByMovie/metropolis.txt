he had keys.
of course the legend would like to think that.  but no one has keys.  your maze was run.
get some internal police there. tell them to run a perimeter.
but have them wait for me 'till they move in on him.
what brings you inside?
cleaning up a mess.
some things never change, do they?
I have got to get back.
tanner.
where you plugged-in from?
new york.
I am south dakota.
what?
the weather.
what is her name?
who?
the woman you are stuck on.
there is no --
take care.
take care?  where the hell are you going --
as long as it is not 'what's your sign?'
if you could meet god, what would you say to him?
that is a strange question.  you a strange man?
there you are, sitting next to the creator, what do you say?
this is how you pick up women --
-- no.
your life that bad?
no, not me, I have been lucky.  but I have seen what happens to other people --
-- if your life's so good up there gena, what are you doing down here?
do you believe in miracles?
I am serious, how did you know my name?
you were right.
about what?
who are you?!
someone who believes in miracles.
does not make sense.  how the hell does some fucking teenager get to the keys?
sorry, i just design the maze.  keeping the keys secure is your job.
care to tell us how you came into possession of an illegal access program?
look, I am doing mute 'till i have a mouthpiece here who is on my side.
you do not need a lawyer.  we found the program on your laptop.
do not know what you are talking about.
of course you do.  and the only shot you have got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
what is so funny?
this.  no point to it.
why not?
because you will never believe me.
try me.
it was just there.
there?
my uni-net account.  i log on.  the program's there.
just like that?
just like that --
you do not have much sex up there in the real world, do you?
no...
do not know what you are talking about.
of course you do.  and the only shot you have got of keeping your ass from sinking in a sea of shit is to tell me where you got this program.
two maze runners.
someone sends the kid a copy of the access program, then runs the maze at the same time the kid does, using the same codes.
will not be time if he gets access --
-- he won't.
he had access to the keys --
-- yes.
how long 'till we can eject?
we are going to have to reconfigure.
how long?
at least a day.
we can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
go!
this is halden.
halden, how nice to hear your voice.
what do you want?
i have found in life that what one wants is not nearly as important as what one needs.
what do you need?
i need to take back what is mine.
there are two million people in there with you.
yes.
they have nothing to do with this --
-- two million people lost in the digital night.  what do they seek?
god-damn you!
yes, i believe he has --
-- you have made your point!  you have got control of the system.
system's running on auxiliary.  only seven hours before it crashes.
true.
you are in there.  everybody dies, you go with them --
-- but do not you remember?  I am already dead.
have communications contact all interface centers.  tell them due to high demand, we are at full capacity and so temporarily there is no room for anyone else on the system.
what about the customers with reservations?
have the staff apologize profusely and issue credit vouchers.  but remember, it is a capacity problem.  that is all.
the maze has been changed --
-- he says the maze has been changed. i need to know for sure.
remember, I am not the one who chose this.
yes, so which one of us does that make the coward?
where the hell are you going?
unfinished business.
and what about the reconfiguration?
perfect opportunity for you to demonstrate your continued worth.
you sure he is going to come?
it is his nature.
but what if he does not --
-- he will.
voice activate.
activated.
program name?
resurrection.
describe program function.
transmit copy of program via satellite north uplink.
destination?
tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
checking connection.
connection approved.  ready to transmit --
-- transmit now!
you are jumping to conclusions.
he is not plugged-into the system. he is in the fucking system!
try harder.
christoph had spinal cancer.  his body kept rejecting gene therapy. he was desperate.  it was him, it was not us --
-- i saw the program.
corporate fingerprints all over it.
of course they are.  christoph was stealing every piece of code he could get his hands on.
and you were not involved.
because why the hell would you be interested in a program that allows people to live inside your machines?  i mean how much profit could there possibly be from owning the universe and selling space in it to people who are dying, or people who are just god-damned sick of this world --
-- come on, you know f.c.o. regs. anyone caught with their r and d hand in the bio-digitization cookie jar spends the rest of their life in federal penitentiary.  it is not worth it.
the only way to eject it is from the inside.
you have got the keys, send someone in --
-- christoph changed the maze.
one condition.
what?
the truth.
what is it?
the terrace.  first building christoph ever programmed for us.
a hotel?
it is not used for anything.
christoph was a brilliant programmer, but very eccentric.  he insisted it be kept vacant.
why?
he would not say.
christoph was in charge of designing building modules.
that is right.
then what is with all the staffing programs in his account?
good question.
be a hell of a lot easier to digitize a real person, then strip them down to a module you can use to make as many employee programs as you need.
yes, in theory, i suppose that would work.
who did he digitize?
listen to yourself.  digitization.  you know that officially that is a pure fantasy --
-- who did he digitize?!
it is all here...
yes.
the guests are here.
guests?
just like you always wanted.
but this is impossible.
that is the grace of this world.  nothing's impossible.
what is happening?
nothing, go back to sleep.
it is time to wake up.
wake up?!
from the dream.
it is okay.
okay...
it is all been transferred.
why?
to live forever.
she said i have a son...
no, she said she had a son.  in a dream she once called life.
how come i can not remember?
because i took it out of your memory.
why --
-- because there'll be no remorse. not in my world.
access granted.  male or female?
male.
waiter, busboy, maitre-de --
-- waiter.
standard, modern, upscale --
-- standard.
scanning body type.
the patterns were moved around, but they were not changed.
true.  but why?
halden sent men to kill me in my sleep, but simple illusions won out.  so he now sends the legend to finish the deed.
no.
then what?
but what would happen to me?  i have no body to return to.
not my problem.
so wrong --
divinity?
yes.
you are not a god.
in here i am.
god creates man, man creates technology, technology creates god.  end into beginning.
in a computer program.
the new world.
it is not real.
not real?
you were the one who was dying.
yes...
you sealed off the system.  when it crashes, everyone dies with you.
yes, but only in the dream they call life.
dream?!
and all dreams, no matter how appealing, must eventually end.
someone you have to get back to?
no.
what did he tell you?
the truth.
not his style.
katie was digitized.
then you had her killed.
why would i do that?
to hide the evidence.
we drugged her.  so she would not remember.
try harder.
there was no need to kill her.
then where is she?
come on tanner, think this through.
an interface attendant.
where?
times square.
need the disk back!
insurance.
insurance?
if she is alive, you get it back.
I am sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --
-- katie.
you went to my high-school?
no.
then how do you know about --
-- you told me.
what are you talking about?
most nights you wake up crying. never knowing why.
who are you?!
we worked together on the inside. you were on my programming team --
-- the inside?
night city.
identical.  one's you.  one's digital.
that is not possible.  no one can do that.
corporation can.
that is why they told you you can not go inside.  they can not have you running into her.
her?
you said we were on the same programming team.
yes.
but i do not know anything about programming.
once they digitized you, they added it.
why?
it was a test.
for what?
to see how long it would take for me to realize.
realize?
you were not real.
and it meant something.
yes.
what?
way you kiss me.
i was not with you.
i know.
but you were with me.
not you.  a copy.
what is the difference?
I am sorry.
sorry?!
there was no other choice.
unlimited energy out there.  enough to run this world for all eternity --
-- but you will never be able to get it through the maze.
me?  of course not.  that is why you are here.
with the energy from the net, we can program this world anyway we want.  redwood forests.  oceans. mountains --
-- two million people plugged-in here.
yes.
until you are on the net where the corporation can not touch you, you can not open the system.  they will eject it if you do.
one would assume so.
but once the system touches the net, all links are severed.  everybody dies.
only up there in the dream they called life.
and down here --
program name?
resurrection.
connect to public access.
access established.
select uplink for federal communications office.  department of enforcement.
uplink selected.
