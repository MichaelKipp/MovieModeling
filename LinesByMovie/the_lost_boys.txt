we are getting close...
what is that smell?
ocean air!
smells like something died.
guys, i know it has not been easy... the divorce and now the move...  but i think you are really going to like living in santa carla...
mom, there is an amusement park right on the beach!
that is the boardwalk, sam.
can we go now, huh? lucy maybe later.  grandpa's expecting us.
tell them to get something to eat.
i thought we were poor.
not that poor.
still mad at me?
for what.
for everything.
what!?  he can and i can't?!  no fair!!
that is okay, mom.  i can see it later.  I will help you unload.
when you ran away from home, hitch- hiked to berkeley, spent the night in golden gate park and begged for spare change in the morning?
you have heard this story before?
so many times, I am starting to think it happened to me.
he looks dead.
he is just a deep sleeper.
he is not breathing, mom.
this is kind of a cool place.
I am so excited i just can not hide it.  I am about to lode control and i think i like it.
will you give mom a break?
grandpa does not own a t.v.  have you noticed?  there is no t.v. santa carla has no malls, no cineplexes and now i will not even have mtv.  i will not know anything hip happening anymore.
hey, sam, we are flat broke.
even poor people have t.v.s
lucy, you are the only woman i ever knew did not improve her situation by getting divorced.
a big legal war was not going to improve anybody's situation.  we have all been through enough.  besides i was raised better than that. thanks for having us, dad.
ouch, my hair...
when i dressed like you do now, you threw me out of the house. i used to hate your short hair and your uptight suits... then i went ahead and married one... i went yuppie and you became a hippie... were still out of synch.
this room is mine.
i was here first.
okay.  I will flip you for it.
help me, mom.  help.
soon.
... and stay outta here.
you have a t.v.?
no, i just like to read the t.v. guide.  read the t.v. guide, you do not need a t.v...
you are beautiful.
wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
you have got a generous nature.  i like that in a person.  my name is max.
lucy.
so what can i help you find tonight, lucy?  we have got it all.  best selection in santa carla.
I am not looking for a tape.  what i need is --
-- a job.
do i look that needy?
where are we going?
nowhere.
then what is the rush?  you are chasing that girl, why do not you just admit it?  I am at the mercy of your sex glands!
do not you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
and these archies should be over here with the richie rich's.
where the hell are you from, kryton???
phoenix actually and these bullwinkle and...
just passing through santa carla?
no, I am a resident as of today and you will probably be seeing a lot of me... I have been collecting comic books all my life... perhaps you would like to see my collection?
i do not like horror comics.
this one could save your life.
are you following me?
well, i...
did you want to talk to me?
well... yeah.  sure.
okay.  talk.
i just wanted to... i, uh...
it is early.  why do we have to go home?
bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
I will hitch.
oh, no, you won't.
mom, you hitched all the way to berkeley once, remember?
mom, just give me five more minutes. just five minutes, okay?
he met a girl.
i guess no one cares what i got a job.
can we get a t.v.?
do i have to do this?
come on, sam, you know before there were malls there was 'like the ocean.'
see you later.
i get off in another twenty minutes.  i thought maybe we would all get a bite together.
I will pass.
hi...
if you want your ear pierced, I will do it.
what is your name?
star.
oh.  your folks, too, huh?
what do you mean?
ex-hippies.  my mom was one.   i came this close to being called moon child, or moon beam or something.  but star's great.  i like star.
me, too.
I am michael.
michael's great.  i like michael.
i guess you are new around here.
sort of.  we used to come here summers when i was kid.  now we are here on a permanent basis.
are you hungry?  wanna get something to eat?
okay.
where you going?
for a ride.
with him?
yeah.
hi... I am laddie.
this is michael.
we still going?
honda 250, huh?
that is right.
c'mon, star.  climb on.
star?...
i can not beat a triumph.
you do not have to beat me, michael.  just try to keep up.
c'mon, michael.  i want to go.
no.  stick around.
we were gonna grab some food.
good idea.  marko.  we are hungry.
i can not sleep with the closet door open, either.  not even a crack.  your father does not mind, though. it could be wide open for all he cared.  i think one of the reasons i divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the closet monster!
closet monster!?
dad!  do not sneak up on people like that!
it is called the indian walk. walkin' without makin' a sound.
thanks, grandpa...
lots more where he came from.
lights out, sam.
soon as i finish this comic.  okay?
so how do you like those maggots, michael?
what?...
you are eating maggots.  how do they taste?
leave him alone.
sorry, michael.  no hard feelings, huh?  here.  try these noodles.
don't!  stop!
why?  they are only noodles.
go away.
you are supposed to watch me and entertain me, and make me appreciate the brief but happy years of childhood.
entertain yourself.
grandpa, stop doin' the indian walk!
got to keep in practice.  it is a dyin' art.
good!
whatcha doin' over here?
oh... i was just... having a look at your truck.  what is all that wood in there for?
been fixin' to build me fence one of these days.  bought all the materials, then put it off... for about ten years.  well, one more day will not hurt. wanna go into town with me?
great.  i wanna get some new comics.
are we havin' fun or what?
i thought we were goin' into town.
i hate goin' into town.  that is about as close to town as i like to get.
what did you do last night?  you look wasted.
i can not remember much after the chinese food that looked like maggots.
you do not suppose grandpa's an alien, do you?
what would that make mom?
you are right... not even to mention you and me.
did you spill something?
no.  why?
the bottoms of your feet are covered with salt.
i told you it was pretty weird chinese food.
wanna go to the comic book store?
no.
how do you like santa carla?
it is a pretty cool place if you are a martian.
or a vampire.
are you guys sniffing old newsprint or something?
you think you are cool, do not you? you think you know what is really happening, do not you?  well, you do not know shit, buddy.
yeah, you think we just work in a comic book store for our dad, huh?
this is not a comic book store, right.  it is a bakery.
this is just our cover.  we are dedicated to a higher purpose.
now i get it... you are like those people in the airport trying to get you to give them money. you are part of a cult.
we are fighters for truth, justice, and the american way.
you better get some fresh air.
i do not like horror comics.
think of this more as a survival manual... there is our number on the back, and pray that you never need to call us.
I am going to pray that i never need to call you.
say hello to thorn.
hi, thorn.
you are cute, max.
i know.  it is so 'eighties.'  it is the cute decade.
ouch.
do not be a baby.  that did not hurt and you know it.
i would not have given my mom such a hard time about moving here if I would known i was going to meet you.
i used to fight with my family all the time... just got fed up and ran away.
now you and david...
no.  they have made me one of them, but i miss my family.
let's go see them.
no... no, everything's different now...
look.
you are almost one of us now, michael.
I am my own man.
get your bike.  we are going someplace.
i had the dream again about them.
who, laddie?
i know it was them, star.  I am sure of it.  he was working in the yard -- hammering something.  the yard was big with lots of grass.  there was no boardwalk and no ocean.  she was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair.  i was there, too.  and a dog -- but i do not know its name.  i was running and the dog was chasing me. then i turned around and chased the dog.  they were watching me. drinking their cold drinks and laughing.  and i was laughing, too.
laddie... you can still remember. you can still remember home.
it was a dream, star.
no, laddie.  it was a memory.
you did not tell david?
no.  just you.
promise me you will keep it that way.  you are not like the others, laddie.  you are like me.  i can still remember, too.
you like michael.
i like michael.
you better not like him too much.
what is going' on?
what is goin' on, marko?
mom's home?...
no.  on the phone.
michael, are you still in bed?
no.  I am up.
michael, will you do me a favor this evening?  will you stay home with sam tonight?  I am meeting max for dinner after work.
i watch him all day.  the only time i have more myself is at night.  let grandpa watch him.
grandpa has plans of his own.  michael, i want you to do this. everybody has been bending over backwards for you.  you come home late.  you sleep in to the middle of the day -- sam is always alone. you do exactly what you want... tonight do what i want for a change.
okay?
okay.
I am making you a sandwich.
do not bother.
lose the earring, michael.  it is not happening.  it is just not happening.
piss off.
you have such a great personality, michael.   you should open your own charm school.
not impressed, are you?
ohm i would have been... one marriage ago.
so, I have met the one woman on the planet who is going to hold my success against me.
you seem like a terrific guy, max, and I am grateful for the job...
but i do not think it is what you really want to do, is it?
i guess if i had my choice, I would like to do something that involves children.  work with kids in some way.  teenagers, maybe.  and santa carla seems to be full of them.
yeah.  runaways, mostly.  they come from all over.  attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  lucy... listen i know i have no right to ask you this... but do not look for another job just yet... i mean besides being the best employee i have... i think you are cute.
i hear this is the decade for cute.
michael?
do not turn on the light.
what happened, michael!?
nanook...
what about nonook?  what have you done to nanook?!  what have you done to my dog, you asshole?!
nothing!  i did not hurt him.  he bit me!  this is my blood!
what did you to do him, michael? why did he bite you?
he was protecting you!
what??
look at your reflection in the mirror!!
all day.
can not stand light?
wears sunglasses in the house.
bad breath?  long fingernails?
his fingernails are longer, but he always has bad breath.
salt sticks to the bottom of his feet.
yeah.
he is a vampire alright.
get yourself a good sharp stake and drive it through his heart.
i can not do that!
why not?
he is my brother.
you better get a garlic t-shirt, buddy.
sam.  is everything all right?
mom.  i think we have got to have a long talk about something?
what is wrong?  tell me.
we can not talk about it on the phone.
we have got to stick together, sam. you have got to help me.
what about mom?
no!  we can not tell mom!  please, sam.  do not tell her.
i do not know, michael.  this is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'd'.
just for a few days, sam.  give me a chance to work this out by myself.
sam!  what happened!?  you had me scared to death.  are you all right?
sorry, mom.  it was a mistake. i thought i saw something out the window.  i was reading this horror comic and i guess i go a little carried away...
where is michael?
he is already gone to bed.
can i sleep in here with you tonight?
in here?
do you mind?  it was a real scary comic.
okay.  have you been eating pizza?  you smell like garlic.
i have to talk to you.  please wake up.
have to sleep.  have to sleep, michael.
when?
tonight.  at the boardwalk...
sure.
does that mean we are, or we aren't?
we are...
then let's act like friends. let's talk.  i know this is a new place, and --
-- if there is a girl, we could talk about her.
I am tired now.
wait a minute, kiddo.
mom... please.
we have been aware of some very serious vampire activity in this town for a long time.
santa carla has become a haven for the undead.
as a matter of fact, we are almost certain that ghouls and werewolves occupy high positions at city hall.
i have something to tell you guys.  not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I am convinced my mother's dating one!
that is very probable.  what is your reasoning?
well... he only shows up at the store after dark.  and today, his dog attacked my mom.  listen to this.  from vampires everywhere...  'vampires require a daytime protector -- a guardian -- to watch over them as they sleep. for it is during the day that the vampire is most vulnerable. since they hold sway over animals, fierce dogs -- the hounds of hell -- are often employed for this purpose.'
i wish they were vampires so i could nuke them in their hearts.
how do you know they are not?
they would not be out in the daytime.
exactly how many vampires have you actually destroyed?
all together?
zero.
smells good.  when do we eat?
i told max eight o'clock.
max?  you men we are having company again?
'again'?  dad... you have not had company in this house since mom died eight years ago.
right.  an' now we are having company again.  I will take mine to go.
max is coming for dinner, michael. I would like you to meet him.
can't.  got plans of my own.
there is only three weeks left of summer, michael.  things are going to change around here when school starts.
gotta go, mom.
is it okay for the guest to see the food before the dinner?
you are thinking of the groom not seeing the bride before the wedding.
oh, right.  i always gets those two confused.
these are my dinner guests. edgar and alan.  the frog brothers.
ah... i did not know you were having guests...
well if we are in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
no, no... there is plenty for everybody... oh, max, this is sam... and the frog brothers...
this looks terrific, lucy.
boy!  somebody areound here sure has bad breath!
nanook, stop breathin' on me.
c'mere, nanook.
how about a little parmesan cheese on that?
okay, sam.  thanks.
max!  what is wrong?
it is garlic!!  i like garlic, but...
does it burn?
burn??  are you kidding?  it is freezing!
oh, no.  now what?
must be a circuit breaker.
he is not glowing.
hit the lights again.
i am?
yeah.  I am not trying to replace your dad... or steal your mom.  i just want to be your friend.
I am really sorry, max.
our batting average is not very good is it?  so far we are zero for two.
i do not understand sam.  he is just not like this.
boys sam's age need a good deal of discipline, or they walk all over you.
he does not walk all over me.
i do not want to fight with you, lucy.  come on.  let's give it one more try.  dinner at my house, tomorrow night.  I am cooking.
where is she?!
hey, take it easy.
where is star, david?!
if you ever want to see star again, then you better come with us.
what is this, david?
you are one of us, now -- are not you?
it is that girl from the boardwalk. is she one of them?
i do not know.
i have to talk to you.  can i come up?
okay.
do you know where david took me tonight, star?  do you?!
yes... and I am to blame for it. if you had not met me... if i had not liked you... i tried to warn you...
that night in the cave -- that was not wine they gave me to drink... it was blood!  david's blood.  I am one of them, star!  I am just like them!
not yet... you are like laddie and me... half-vampires... you are not a full vampire until you have made your first kill... you were supposed to be mine... but i couldn't, michael.
why not?
because i love you...
then it is not too late for us...
it is not too late for you to be saved... but each night... it becomes harder and harder for me to resist killing...
i know, I have felt it...
I am weak... soon I will need to feed.
david's looking for me... i have to go.
you are not going anywhere...  sam...
star.
do not kill anybody until we get back to you...
who are you calling?
the marines.
okay.  where is nosferatu?
the prince of darkness.
the nightcrawler.  the bloodsucker.
el vampiro.
should i run him through?
I have only got one question for you, and i want an honest answer.  have you taken any human victims yet?
of course not!
if you are telling the truth, it means we can save you.
he is telling the truth!  are not you, michael?
to free you, we must destroy the leader of the vampires.
david.
i do not want names!  just lead me to him.  where is their nest?
I will take you there.
i said, i'll take you there. nobody's going near star without me.
okay, okay.
just so you know:  if you try to stop us, or vamp-out in any way, I will stake you without thinking twice about it.
chill out edgar.
you have got to put this on.
take laddie.
huh?
save laddie first.
what is that smell!?
vampires, my friend.  vampires.
i thought they would be in coffins.
that is exactly what this place is. one great big coffin.  let's stake 'em.
i'll have to drive!
we do not ride with vampires.
fine!  stay here!
burn rubber does not mean warp speed!
we blew it, edgar!  we lost it!
shut up!
we unraveled in the face of the enemy!
they pulled a mind-scramble on us, man!  it was not our fault! they opened their eyes and talked!
oh, no...
what?
there is a cop behind us.
michael!  get behind the wheel.
huh?...
they are gaining on us!
you gotta drive!
they are looking at us.
they are going to book us.
no, nanook!  quiet!
your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
well... we blew plan a.
time to activate plan b.
what is plan b?
we do not have one yet.  and we only have two and a half hours to come up with one.
what happens in tow and a half hours?
the dun goes down and they will be comin' for us.
what did you say?
vampires, mom!  everywhere! you have got to tell the police! the newspapers!  the tv stations! they will listen to you.  they will believe you...  you are a mom!
not funny, sam!
this is not a joke.  they know that we know about them.  they are coming to the house as soon as it gets dark!
stop it, sam.  stop it right now!
but, mom...
not another word!  i can not believe you are doing this.  I am going to see max tonight and you are trying to ruin it for me again.
no, I am not...
there is nothing wrong with max.  i do not know why you do not --
-- I am not talking about max!  to hell with max!
good.
that is just the way we like it.
grandpa, the widow johnson called. she said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
did we have a date tonight?
i guess so.  she said not to be late.
i better get cleaned up, then.
they will be coming for laddie and me, will not they?
they will be coming for all of us.
maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
i hope so.
something the matter?
no, no.  just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
let me tell you something about boys.  they are like weeds.  they grow best when they are ignored.
i thought you said they needed discipline?
well... what do i know?  I am a bachelor.  lucy... this is going to be a very special night, i promise you.
do not go out there!  stop him!
sam, do not --
did you see that sucker burn?!
man, we totally annihilated his night-stalkin' ass!
two down and two to go.
four to go.
whattaya mean?
those two we brought back with us. the girl and the kid.  i do not trust 'em.  i say we terminate 'em while we can.
you know what?  you are absolutely right.
death to all vampires!
maximum body-count.
we are awesome monster-bashers!
the meanest!
the baddest!
you can not kill me, star.
i will, david!
no, star.  put it down.  put it down.
what is the matter?
i... i do not feel any differently.  do you?
ohmygod...
mom!
what happened?  is everybody all right?!
max... what are you talking about?
it was all going to be so perfect, lucy.  one big happy family.  my boys... and yours.
but you passed the test!
michael invited me in.  never invite a vampire into your house. it renders you powerless.
what?!  did you know that!?
will somebody please tell me what this is all about!?
it is you i was after all along, lucy.  to be our day time guardian. i knew if we could bring sam and michael into the faimly, there would be no way you could say no.
i didn't invite you in this time!
michael!...
get out, mom!  run!
it is gone.  i feel it!
so do i!
