not if no one finds out.
thank you.  oh. my wife. she had a card here for her migraine pills. she ain't gonna be around no more... so if you...
i already tossed that out.  somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. of course, that's none of my business.
don't make it less true.
do you call it a game when only one man win each time? i think you call it a damn shame.
word wit'cha. in private.
you need some weed?
been years since i fooled with that.  you know a white girl? dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
that ain't up to me to hook you up. naw what i mean? she her own, you know?
huh?
i don't pimp that.  you talkin' about who i think you talkin' about, you mean rae. rae doole. sexy little split tail, like you say. i can't hook you up with that. i got two girls. one ain't in town, the other one pregnant. so... you on your own.
this rae... you get with her?
shit. who hasn't?
why you say that?
she got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, i'm different. sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. girl got an itch. you know... what's a nigga to do?
she like it rough? you like beatin' on her?
that ain't my scene. if that's somethin' you into...
now, hold up.
see, that girl is in my favor. you heard me, nigga? you fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
you collar that dog, boy. i ain't gonna hurt nobody. just wanted to know who she was.
like i say, you wanna hook that up... i ain't in ya way. that switch of hers been all over this town. got that sickness, you know.
what'chu sayin'?
she a freak. got what you call a sexual addiction.
what'chu sayin'?

like i told you.
take it easy now. don't rush it.
how long... how long i been out?

two days?
after your fever broke, you'd wake up in spells... long enough to get that medicine in ya.
where's ronnie?
well i don't...
wait. he left.
i don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
don't need none.
then i better be on my way. don't wanna put you out no more.
think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
naw'sir... i gotta be on my way.
best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
let me say somethin' first...
why you got me chained?
way i see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
the fuck you been doin' to me?
i ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... remember like i say, i found you in the road...
get this goddamn thing off me!
now, no harm's come to you... and i aim to keep it that way. ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. i'd be chasin' you all night.
well i'm woke now... you can take this off.
gal, you ain't right yet.
i'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. now take this goddamn chain off...
how you let men treat ya like they do?
what?
these men you up under. how you let them do ya like that?
do me? do me like this, you mean? like chainin' me up?
you know what i'm talkin' about.  all that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
the hell you know about me?! you got no right to talk to me about that shit! the hell you think you are?
i've saved ya life, gal. i can do and say whatever the fuck i want.
i give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. get you to the kitchen. you need the bathroom, it'll reach.
what do you want?
we got everything we need. plenty of food. ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
what do you want from me?!  whatever you gonna do to me, just do it! and let me go!
god saw to it to put you in my path. and i aim to cure ya of your wickedness.
you some kind'a pervert?
no ma'am.
some crazy jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
in my house, you watch that lip...
look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. i'll do whatever you want. but you gotta let me go. you can't do this! you can't keep me here!
you sick. you got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
let me go!
you can holla y'self hoarse. ain't gonna bend my will.  right or wrong, you gonna mind me.  gonna suffer you like jesus say, to the faithless and the perverse generation.
now you get up! and you get in my house!
or what?
stop it! stop it! it hurts!
whose doin' is that?
wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
you gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
no, ma'am. you stop that foolishness.
hm-mm... hm-mm...
i said... stop!
i can't!
you like this? walkin' me through this field like i's your mule?
can't sit all day on that sofa. need to get your legs strong.
if i break one you gonna shoot me?
my daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. that's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. know why it's best to rotate em like that?
uh-uh.
cuz once in a while soil need a change. corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. so next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. that give off a lot of nitrate. change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  sting a bit?
itches.
means ya healin'.  so all this farmin' make me think on matthew. matthew 13. the parable of the sower? man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
uh-uh.
the seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of god... and understand the word of god. not enough for you to hear what i'm sayin', you gotta understand.
i know. i get it. what's matthew doin'?
gal... matthew ain't doin' shit... this just a story...  look it. i've seen it in nature, i've seen it in men. ya got to change up your crop. cuz that seed ain't gettin' in.  ya gotta cut this shit out. got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. like you somebody's dog. no woman... who joins in union with almighty god... or man... in the sanctity of marriage... should degrade herself... and bend to another man's will!
my god, gal, don't you got no sense? i ain't sayin' i ain't weak? shit. playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  i got sin in me! i ain't go'n lie! but i got respect! and all you got is bile, gal!
let go of me...
givin' up that switch like a tramp! behind my back and kill my baby...!
and, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
that young lady's size, right'cher.
well, that makes it easier.
mind i ask, what's all this business here?
these are whipped body creams. it's like a lotion.
for your hands?
some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. so now they have scented creams. they help moisturize a woman's skin.  this one's my favorite. it's called ginger souffle. i recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. so... perhaps just after a shower.
i'll take a jar of that, too.
i brung you a little basket of goodies. fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.
you didn't have to do this.
just wanted to say how much i appreciate you helping me the other day. my niece, she's cured up, and i got you to thank.
well that's good. i'm happy to hear it.
this was very sweet of you.
well. hope you enjoy it.
was that lincoln james i seen run off?
he's fine. just had a bad fall.
why's his britches round his knees?
r.l., you gonna have to get on. i can't have nobody round my place.
you get a call from rose?
this ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. just don't want nobody around me now.
somethin' wrong with ya phone? been callin' the last few days.
goin' dove huntin'?
you gotta go, r.l.. i ain't foolin' this time.
you sayin' that gun's for me if i don't?
you ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. i got my mind made up and i ain't gonna be moved on this.
ain't gonna be moved?
got no place for preachin' here. not now. so you do as i say...
or what?
i told you to turn back!
are you outta ya goddamn mind?
man like you ought not take the lord's name like you just done.
a naked woman, chained in ya house?
i'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. i found her beat. left for dead. so i brung her home.
laz, i know about that girl.  good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  oh, laz. she's had a mess of crabs and them std's. what'chu thinking?
i haven't laid a hand. on my life, r.l., my wick is dry on this.
you say she was beat on. you call the sheriff on that?
put yo'self in my shoes. say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. i been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
what's that chain around her for?
why don't you go'on and ask her. she need to talk wit somebody with sense. folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. and this is how i'm handling it.
this is how you handling it? this is how you handling it?
good. makin' steaks for supper. i expect you to come.
you mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
you treat folks special when they company. it's just supper, r.l., shit.
one thing at a time, laz.
what happened in there... that won't your fault. ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
why she got a chain on her?
that's between her and me. it's private. and i don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
please don't tell my daddy.
my mouth is shut, boy. and that's how we gonna keep it. don't go braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me?
so...  that your first time?
yes'sir.
you struck some gold, didn't ya?
thank you.
i gotta ask you. why do you think laz is keepin' you chained like this?
you know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
so he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  you think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
you a preacher?
that's right.
can i ask you a question?  people always say, you gotta get good with jesus, if you want not to go to hell. that you say sorry for all you done and... and jesus would let you go on to heaven.
you could put it that way.
but that's so fuckin' stupid.  i'm sorry. didn't mean to curse.
what's on your mind?
you can't hurt people... and then just say, i'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. why would heaven want people like that. people who... do what they want and then... switch.
i'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  i think folks carry on about heaven too much. like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. and folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. i can go to shoney's for that.
now that's sharp. that is sharp. chain give you any trouble?
uh-uh.
good. now i got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. r.l. and lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. what do you know how to make?
i don't fuckin' cook.
gal, i been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. and let me tell you...
look it... i put the goddamn dress on, didn't i? i think i'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
if all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  rae. rae! i'm not fightin' with ya. i just know you got more in you than junk.  now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  you know how to boil water?
i can handle that.
well, get to it.
pass them potatoes, lincoln.
y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
this all looks wonderful.
i skipped lunch.
well, dig in, son. got plenty to eat.
mm. mm. now these eggs got some kick to it. what'chu got in this?
ask the chef.
holy shit.
yeah.
sit down, man. need a beer?
sure.
marv, let's get ronnie set up here.
what happened?
they been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. thought it was just some tic i got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  i can't... shoot. target practice i'm a pro. i tag between the numbers each time but...  but when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. i get shaky and... i lose my breath. they called it anxiety. severe anxiety. it can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  it's a long process but... they sent me home.
i guess it could be worse. you could be comin' back in a body bag.
i can't get rae on the phone. she's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
she's around. always is.
i don't know. she's gettin' crazy, like she gets. begged me not to go. got real down. i just think somethin's happened. like she run off with someone. you'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
you been home yet?
uh-uh. i's hitchin' up the interstate when i seen your truck outside.
you need a ride?
this don't feel right. kitchen looks just like i left it. i know, cuz i cleaned it.
she ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
i just been so mixed up lately, gill. and, you know, with her history, i can see how she could get scared...  ...and run.
ronnie. you can't see cuz you're too close to it.  these nervous spells you get. you never had that shit back in school...
that's not right, really, cuz i...
you joined up in that monkey troop cuz you had a plan for yourself. army'd pay for school. you were gonna get a degree, maybe somethin' in business or agriculture and you were gonna make somethin' of yourself.
and then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
now wait...
with all she was doin'. with all the shit she kept doing! you stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
i know about how she was like. but we was different. i's the only person she talked to about it. how she's abused. terrible things, gill, just terrible...
you had a plan! you had a goddamn life! and she just fucked the guts out of you!
it's not her fault, gill. she's had to take care of me all this time, cuz i'd just start throwin' up... choking. just losin' my grip. and she listened. she listened to me.  and... i got better. i don't get nervous like i used to. and since we been together... she been faithful to me. put all that junk behind her...
the only thing that cunt's had behind her is me and half the town fuckin' her.  your first night away, i come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to. you weren't gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her. like she was havin' some kind'a fit.
you gonna steal my truck?
make yourself at home. you done it already.
gotta get that chain off her, laz. somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.
i'm dealin' with what god put before me.
you believe he wants this? a woman chained to ya radiator?
not like that.
then what?
she's tied to me, r.l.. we tied to each other.
they sure liked them devilled eggs.
you drink whiskey?
you take it straight?
sure.
want another?
we drinkin' buddies now?
to freedom.
still makin' jokes?
no joke.
if you want... i can take you back to town now.
i ain't in a hurry.
could you do somethin' for me?
anything.
my life is gone. only life i was livin'. and i lost it.
i'm here with you.
i had love in my heart. and i gave it to one woman. and she gone now.  where am i gonna put all this love?
tell me what to do.
the... chain helps.
i seen a man die. he couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
you just havin' a fit. you ain't goin' nowhere.
he told me... get help. i just stood there and watched him... i watched him die, laz. oh god! goddammit!
oh, laz... he hurt me. he... hurt me so many times.
no one's gonna hurt you no more.
you think god forgives people like that?  you think god forgives people like me?
where you gonna be?
right here. be here all afternoon.  you ready for this?
i'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
i bet you have loyal customers.
you liked what i brung ya?
been eatin' like a princess all week. even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
that'd be nice.
i put on the lotion you got me. can you smell it?
what happened to your face?
got in a little accident.
yeah.
since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.
you need money again?
no. that's not why...  why we always gotta do this? i mean, you and me been at each other as far back as i can remember. wasn't no love between us. and i'm your daughter. i'm the only family you got.
you never needed nobody. always made that clear to me.
yeah. i know i did. but...  i'm tryin' to be dif'rent. i'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
i'm workin' here, rae. can you see that?
i just wanted some make-up.
all that shit's on aisle 5.
i just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
the hell are you talkin' about?
now see? don't do that. i'll go along with all you say about me. but that... you can't pretend no more on that. cuz i was just a kid, momma.  i didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me.  and you let him do it. some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only somebody you had.
i'm sorry... i didn't mean to shout...
all my life i been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. and you gonna lay the blame at my feet? well, i ain't gonna take that.
but... momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... be eye to eye on this... you don't even got to say you're sorry... just say how you knew...
only thing i'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what i should'a done.
i's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
at church?
mm-hm. i don't know if i got a good voice or not but... practice is only on mondays and wednesdays, so...

go'on and sing it, i'll play.
no, you do it. i can't sing.
stop that foolishness. just do as i say and close your eyes.  close your eyes. and think about... well, for a song like this, i'd say you think about what you love.

you testing me? huh? you testin' me, old man?
test. shit. what kind'a test you thinkin'? you mean like, if you a man or not? if you a killer? only one way to prove that. you just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
goddammit, rae!
boy! you keep that gun pointed at me!  you need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  you know she been here with me, don't cha? been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
shut up! shut up!
put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. that's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. she'd fear ya then. cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. she with a real man now. a real killer!
don't... don't say that to me...
son, i'm grown. don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. i'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. so let's have it. end me or get out of my face!
like a man.
yes. i mean that's it. i wanna feel like a man with her. i wanna feel like the only man with her.
it starts like this... fire... that spreads. starts in my head. then moves to my stomach. then it goes lower. i can stop it sometimes but mostly i just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when i met ronnie.  cuz i love him so much. he's all i got in my life that's special. and i like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. when i can do that for him... it's like i'm givin' somethin' of myself that i haven't givin' nobody else.
rae, look at ronnie. and tell him how you feel.
hey.
hey. you wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. hope you don't mind me comin' over.
what do you need?
i need ya help again.

i lied to you. it was wrong. but at the time... i didn't know what to do. imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal i's carryin'...
laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
yes, i do. cuz i feel for you. mean to say...  i got feelings for you. and i didn't want you to think... i didn't...  i don't want you to go away. there's better ways to say what i'm trying to say, but... they it is. don't go away.
laz. i'm gonna put my trust in you. i'm gonna do it knowin' all too well i can get hurt like this. and i have been hurt. just like you.  woman like me, i got a lot of livin' to do. but my days are precious to me. they all i got left. don't want no more fuss. i want love in my life. you understanding me, laz?

don't see generosity much these days. everything always got a catch. guess i'm tryin' to say... thank you.
nobody ever asks me to do shit like this for people. and you know what? i'm good at it. naw what i mean?
what are you doing?
just wanted to see.
you know the rules.  you do know the rules, don't you?

i've had nice things before but i always ruined 'em somehow.
well, this one's yours now. you ready to take care of it?
i don't want you to let go.

you ain't gonna make a fuss, are you?  nothing a man can do when a woman make up her mind.
i never laid a hand on her in anger. not a day. not even when i's drinkin'. but this business got me wonderin' what a good shake and slap would do for her.

nothing's gonna happen. not like everybody over there is in the line of fire with them arabs blowin' themselves up.
can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. i'll go outta my gourd.

my little niece... she got this deep cough.

is your niece older than 12?
oh, she older than that.
my sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. i just copied her prescription. you don't need to pay anything... just take it. but if she gets worse, you give me a call. i wrote my number on the box.
this gonna get you in trouble?
not if no one finds out.
thank you.  oh. my wife. she had a card here for her migraine pills. she ain't gonna be around no more... so if you...
i already tossed that out.  somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. of course, that's none of my business.
don't make it less true.
do you call it a game when only one man win each time? i think you call it a damn shame.
word wit'cha. in private.
you need some weed?
been years since i fooled with that.  you know a white girl? dirty blond hair, split down the middle like?
that ain't up to me to hook you up. naw what i mean? she her own, you know?
huh?
i don't pimp that.  you talkin' about who i think you talkin' about, you mean rae. rae doole. sexy little split tail, like you say. i can't hook you up with that. i got two girls. one ain't in town, the other one pregnant. so... you on your own.
this rae... you get with her?
shit. who hasn't?
why you say that?
she got a spare minute she'll snatch up anyone... but me, i'm different. sometimes she need the real deal, so she call me up. girl got an itch. you know... what's a nigga to do?
she like it rough? you like beatin' on her?
that ain't my scene. if that's somethin' you into...
now, hold up.
see, that girl is in my favor. you heard me, nigga? you fuck with her rough, and you got me to fuck wit.
you collar that dog, boy. i ain't gonna hurt nobody. just wanted to know who she was.
like i say, you wanna hook that up... i ain't in ya way. that switch of hers been all over this town. got that sickness, you know.
what'chu sayin'?
she a freak. got what you call a sexual addiction.
what'chu sayin'?
what i'm tellin' you. girl gotta get dick or she go crazy.
nn-nn... nn-nn... no... n'ronnie!

mm-mm... mm-mm...
come on, gal...
she a freak. got what you call a sexual addiction.
what'chu sayin'?

how a girl get like that?
like i told you.
take it easy now. don't rush it.
how long... how long i been out?

two days?
after your fever broke, you'd wake up in spells... long enough to get that medicine in ya.
where's ronnie?
well i don't...
wait. he left.
i don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
don't need none.
then i better be on my way. don't wanna put you out no more.
think it'd be best if you stayed put while we talk.
naw'sir... i gotta be on my way.
best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
let me say somethin' first...
why you got me chained?
way i see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
the fuck you been doin' to me?
i ain't laid a hand on ya but to ease yo fever... remember like i say, i found you in the road...
get this goddamn thing off me!
now, no harm's come to you... and i aim to keep it that way. ain't gonna... gonna run a train over ya... or however you call it... see... you was runnin' wild on me... these fever dreams you was havin'... these fits. i'd be chasin' you all night.
well i'm woke now... you can take this off.
gal, you ain't right yet.
i'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. now take this goddamn chain off...
how you let men treat ya like they do?
what?
these men you up under. how you let them do ya like that?
do me? do me like this, you mean? like chainin' me up?
you know what i'm talkin' about.  all that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
the hell you know about me?! you got no right to talk to me about that shit! the hell you think you are?
i've saved ya life, gal. i can do and say whatever the fuck i want.
i give ya enough chain so's you can get about the house. get you to the kitchen. you need the bathroom, it'll reach.
what do you want?
we got everything we need. plenty of food. ya medicine still got a few good swallows in it...
what do you want from me?!  whatever you gonna do to me, just do it! and let me go!
god saw to it to put you in my path. and i aim to cure ya of your wickedness.
you some kind'a pervert?
no ma'am.
some crazy jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
in my house, you watch that lip...
look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. i'll do whatever you want. but you gotta let me go. you can't do this! you can't keep me here!
you sick. you got a sickness... we broke that fever... we gonna break that hold the devil got on ya.
let me go!
you can holla y'self hoarse. ain't gonna bend my will.  right or wrong, you gonna mind me.  gonna suffer you like jesus say, to the faithless and the perverse generation.
now you get up! and you get in my house!
or what?
stop it! stop it! it hurts!
whose doin' is that?
wicked little bitch... gonna cut me...
you gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
no, ma'am. you stop that foolishness.
hm-mm... hm-mm...
i said... stop!
i can't!
you like this? walkin' me through this field like i's your mule?
can't sit all day on that sofa. need to get your legs strong.
if i break one you gonna shoot me?
my daddy was one of the first mens to organize soil conservation in these parts. that's a group of farmers, you know, each season they'd rotate the crop. know why it's best to rotate em like that?
uh-uh.
cuz once in a while soil need a change. corn take up a lot of nitrate in the fertilizer. so next crop what ya do is plant ya some soy beans. that give off a lot of nitrate. change keeps it all growin' and growin' strong.  sting a bit?
itches.
means ya healin'.  so all this farmin' make me think on matthew. matthew 13. the parable of the sower? man toss seed on rock, on the wayside, some fell in thorns... you know the story?
uh-uh.
the seed that land on good soil is for them who hear the word of god... and understand the word of god. not enough for you to hear what i'm sayin', you gotta understand.
i know. i get it. what's matthew doin'?
gal... matthew ain't doin' shit... this just a story...  look it. i've seen it in nature, i've seen it in men. ya got to change up your crop. cuz that seed ain't gettin' in.  ya gotta cut this shit out. got no cause to be up under these fools, ruttin' on ya like you a bitch. like you somebody's dog. no woman... who joins in union with almighty god... or man... in the sanctity of marriage... should degrade herself... and bend to another man's will!
my god, gal, don't you got no sense? i ain't sayin' i ain't weak? shit. playin' guitar in the blood-bucket jukes all ya life... a nigga learn how to sin, let me tell you!  i got sin in me! i ain't go'n lie! but i got respect! and all you got is bile, gal!
let go of me...
givin' up that switch like a tramp! behind my back and kill my baby...!
and, sir... do you have a size in mind for what you're lookin' for?
that young lady's size, right'cher.
well, that makes it easier.
mind i ask, what's all this business here?
these are whipped body creams. it's like a lotion.
for your hands?
some women prefer not to scent their bodies with perfume. so now they have scented creams. they help moisturize a woman's skin.  this one's my favorite. it's called ginger souffle. i recommend... applying the cream while the skin is still damp. so... perhaps just after a shower.
i'll take a jar of that, too.
i brung you a little basket of goodies. fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.
you didn't have to do this.
just wanted to say how much i appreciate you helping me the other day. my niece, she's cured up, and i got you to thank.
well that's good. i'm happy to hear it.
this was very sweet of you.
well. hope you enjoy it.
was that lincoln james i seen run off?
he's fine. just had a bad fall.
why's his britches round his knees?
r.l., you gonna have to get on. i can't have nobody round my place.
you get a call from rose?
this ain't got nothin' to do with that woman. just don't want nobody around me now.
somethin' wrong with ya phone? been callin' the last few days.
goin' dove huntin'?
you gotta go, r.l.. i ain't foolin' this time.
you sayin' that gun's for me if i don't?
you ain't gonna talk me outta shit no more. i got my mind made up and i ain't gonna be moved on this.
ain't gonna be moved?
got no place for preachin' here. not now. so you do as i say...
or what?
i told you to turn back!
are you outta ya goddamn mind?
man like you ought not take the lord's name like you just done.
a naked woman, chained in ya house?
i'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. i found her beat. left for dead. so i brung her home.
laz, i know about that girl.  good number of this town's sinners got my ear, you know.  oh, laz. she's had a mess of crabs and them std's. what'chu thinking?
i haven't laid a hand. on my life, r.l., my wick is dry on this.
you say she was beat on. you call the sheriff on that?
put yo'self in my shoes. say you out here, alone, with a beaten, half naked, white woman loves to fuck. i been toe to toe with the law in this town for no more than being black and nearby.
what's that chain around her for?
why don't you go'on and ask her. she need to talk wit somebody with sense. folks been ruttin' and beatin' on this gal all her days. and this is how i'm handling it.
this is how you handling it? this is how you handling it?
good. makin' steaks for supper. i expect you to come.
you mean with you and that woman chained to ya radiator?
you treat folks special when they company. it's just supper, r.l., shit.
one thing at a time, laz.
what happened in there... that won't your fault. ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
why she got a chain on her?
that's between her and me. it's private. and i don't want you goin' off and tellin' ya daddy.
please don't tell my daddy.
my mouth is shut, boy. and that's how we gonna keep it. don't go braggin' to ya buddies, ya heard me?
so...  that your first time?
yes'sir.
you struck some gold, didn't ya?
thank you.
i gotta ask you. why do you think laz is keepin' you chained like this?
you know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
so he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...  you think he's crazy for thinkin' that?
you a preacher?
that's right.
can i ask you a question?  people always say, you gotta get good with jesus, if you want not to go to hell. that you say sorry for all you done and... and jesus would let you go on to heaven.
you could put it that way.
but that's so fuckin' stupid.  i'm sorry. didn't mean to curse.
what's on your mind?
you can't hurt people... and then just say, i'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. why would heaven want people like that. people who... do what they want and then... switch.
i'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.  i think folks carry on about heaven too much. like it's some all-you-can- eat buffet up in the clouds. and folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. i can go to shoney's for that.
now that's sharp. that is sharp. chain give you any trouble?
uh-uh.
good. now i got the steaks on, potatoes at a boil, and biscuits ready to pop in the oven. r.l. and lincoln out yonder grillin' up the corn. what do you know how to make?
i don't fuckin' cook.
gal, i been around hard-cursin' folk all my life. and let me tell you...
look it... i put the goddamn dress on, didn't i? i think i'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
if all you got is filth comin' out'cha mouth... people just gonna tune ya out.  rae. rae! i'm not fightin' with ya. i just know you got more in you than junk.  now, you sayin' you don't know how to cook anything at all?  you know how to boil water?
i can handle that.
well, get to it.
pass them potatoes, lincoln.
y'all let me know if these steaks are too dry.
this all looks wonderful.
i skipped lunch.
well, dig in, son. got plenty to eat.
mm. mm. now these eggs got some kick to it. what'chu got in this?
ask the chef.
holy shit.
yeah.
sit down, man. need a beer?
sure.
marv, let's get ronnie set up here.
what happened?
they been keepin' a folder on me cuz of my stomach. like how it was just before we'd play ball back in school. thought it was just some tic i got, or ulcers like my daddy had.  i can't... shoot. target practice i'm a pro. i tag between the numbers each time but...  but when there's really loud noises around me... somethin' happens. i get shaky and... i lose my breath. they called it anxiety. severe anxiety. it can be fixed and all... just not in time for....  it's a long process but... they sent me home.
i guess it could be worse. you could be comin' back in a body bag.
i can't get rae on the phone. she's not at home... none of her friends seen her anywhere.
she's around. always is.
i don't know. she's gettin' crazy, like she gets. begged me not to go. got real down. i just think somethin's happened. like she run off with someone. you'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
you been home yet?
uh-uh. i's hitchin' up the interstate when i seen your truck outside.
you need a ride?
this don't feel right. kitchen looks just like i left it. i know, cuz i cleaned it.
she ever tell you she was thinkin' of taking off?
i just been so mixed up lately, gill. and, you know, with her history, i can see how she could get scared...  ...and run.
ronnie. you can't see cuz you're too close to it.  these nervous spells you get. you never had that shit back in school...
that's not right, really, cuz i...
you joined up in that monkey troop cuz you had a plan for yourself. army'd pay for school. you were gonna get a degree, maybe somethin' in business or agriculture and you were gonna make somethin' of yourself.
and then you had to fall in love with the school slut.
now wait...
with all she was doin'. with all the shit she kept doing! you stayed stuck to that bitch's ass and you wouldn't let go.
i know about how she was like. but we was different. i's the only person she talked to about it. how she's abused. terrible things, gill, just terrible...
you had a plan! you had a goddamn life! and she just fucked the guts out of you!
it's not her fault, gill. she's had to take care of me all this time, cuz i'd just start throwin' up... choking. just losin' my grip. and she listened. she listened to me.  and... i got better. i don't get nervous like i used to. and since we been together... she been faithful to me. put all that junk behind her...
the only thing that cunt's had behind her is me and half the town fuckin' her.  your first night away, i come over and drop off the spare keys like you wanted me to. you weren't gone two hours and she was aching to get me inside her. like she was havin' some kind'a fit.
you gonna steal my truck?
make yourself at home. you done it already.
gotta get that chain off her, laz. somethin' like this gets out, you could land in a heap of trouble.
i'm dealin' with what god put before me.
you believe he wants this? a woman chained to ya radiator?
not like that.
then what?
she's tied to me, r.l.. we tied to each other.
they sure liked them devilled eggs.
you drink whiskey?
you take it straight?
sure.
want another?
we drinkin' buddies now?
to freedom.
still makin' jokes?
no joke.
if you want... i can take you back to town now.
i ain't in a hurry.
could you do somethin' for me?
anything.
my life is gone. only life i was livin'. and i lost it.
i'm here with you.
i had love in my heart. and i gave it to one woman. and she gone now.  where am i gonna put all this love?
tell me what to do.
the... chain helps.
i seen a man die. he couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
you just havin' a fit. you ain't goin' nowhere.
he told me... get help. i just stood there and watched him... i watched him die, laz. oh god! goddammit!
oh, laz... he hurt me. he... hurt me so many times.
no one's gonna hurt you no more.
you think god forgives people like that?  you think god forgives people like me?
where you gonna be?
right here. be here all afternoon.  you ready for this?
i'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
i bet you have loyal customers.
you liked what i brung ya?
been eatin' like a princess all week. even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
that'd be nice.
i put on the lotion you got me. can you smell it?
what happened to your face?
got in a little accident.
yeah.
since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.
you need money again?
no. that's not why...  why we always gotta do this? i mean, you and me been at each other as far back as i can remember. wasn't no love between us. and i'm your daughter. i'm the only family you got.
you never needed nobody. always made that clear to me.
yeah. i know i did. but...  i'm tryin' to be dif'rent. i'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
i'm workin' here, rae. can you see that?
i just wanted some make-up.
all that shit's on aisle 5.
i just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
the hell are you talkin' about?
now see? don't do that. i'll go along with all you say about me. but that... you can't pretend no more on that. cuz i was just a kid, momma.  i didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me.  and you let him do it. some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only somebody you had.
i'm sorry... i didn't mean to shout...
all my life i been puttin' out your fires, with you givin' out your snatch to every waggin' dick in this town. and you gonna lay the blame at my feet? well, i ain't gonna take that.
but... momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... be eye to eye on this... you don't even got to say you're sorry... just say how you knew...
only thing i'm sorry for is listenin' to my parents and having you instead of doin' what i should'a done.
i's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
at church?
mm-hm. i don't know if i got a good voice or not but... practice is only on mondays and wednesdays, so...
you gonna sing me somethin'?
when? now? oh. no.

i think it'd be better if you talk to me.
yeah?
just about anything, you know. it can be funny or... not. just tell me somethin'.
well. that's my vomit. i came in here to get sick. i thought i'd make the toilet but... anyway, i got sick.

i feel better. do you?
yeah, i do.
sorry.
looks like you know a song.
don't know where i learn't it, but... it's there in my head.
how you feelin' today?
you know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? like your eyes can open a little bit more.
i know that.
woke up real early. sun was shining. just thought i'd mess around, try to learn a song.
go'on and sing it, i'll play.
no, you do it. i can't sing.
stop that foolishness. just do as i say and close your eyes.  close your eyes. and think about... well, for a song like this, i'd say you think about what you love.
what i love.
get a good picture in your mind.
ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? gill told me. told me how you and he... you and everybody...
ronnie. please, baby...
did 'ya have fun with her? sweet as a peach, i bet. huh? huh?
goddamn it, i ask you a question, you better answer it, or i'm gonna blast a hole in ya!
ronnie...
you shut up!
careful how you point that gun, boy.
or what? or what?
boy? you here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody?
ain't gonna be callin' me boy when i blow your face off.
you sayin' you'll do what?
you heard me, mother-fucker. i'll fuckin' kill..
boy! you so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.
you testing me? huh? you testin' me, old man?
test. shit. what kind'a test you thinkin'? you mean like, if you a man or not? if you a killer? only one way to prove that. you just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.
goddammit, rae!
boy! you keep that gun pointed at me!  you need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.  you know she been here with me, don't cha? been all over town, givin' up that switch you thought was your own.
shut up! shut up!
put all your love and dreams into one woman... she turn around and give it all to another man. that's a good reason to paint the wall with me, kid. she'd fear ya then. cuz there won't be no more question in her mind. she with a real man now. a real killer!
don't... don't say that to me...
son, i'm grown. don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. i'm too old to play house...  ...and cowboys. so let's have it. end me or get out of my face!
like a man.
yes. i mean that's it. i wanna feel like a man with her. i wanna feel like the only man with her.
it starts like this... fire... that spreads. starts in my head. then moves to my stomach. then it goes lower. i can stop it sometimes but mostly i just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when i met ronnie.  cuz i love him so much. he's all i got in my life that's special. and i like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. when i can do that for him... it's like i'm givin' somethin' of myself that i haven't givin' nobody else.
rae, look at ronnie. and tell him how you feel.
hey.
hey. you wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. hope you don't mind me comin' over.
what do you need?
i need ya help again.
more cough syrup?
can i come in?
i lied to you. it was wrong. but at the time... i didn't know what to do. imagine you got an earful from folks about that gal i's carryin'...
laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
yes, i do. cuz i feel for you. mean to say...  i got feelings for you. and i didn't want you to think... i didn't...  i don't want you to go away. there's better ways to say what i'm trying to say, but... they it is. don't go away.
laz. i'm gonna put my trust in you. i'm gonna do it knowin' all too well i can get hurt like this. and i have been hurt. just like you.  woman like me, i got a lot of livin' to do. but my days are precious to me. they all i got left. don't want no more fuss. i want love in my life. you understanding me, laz?
i do. god's truth. i do.
it got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. got fresh 22's on her. ain't my doin'. that's just how it came to me. don't worry. nobody gonna come lookin' for it. i got the pinks... got no problem.  ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.
don't see generosity much these days. everything always got a catch. guess i'm tryin' to say... thank you.
nobody ever asks me to do shit like this for people. and you know what? i'm good at it. naw what i mean?
what are you doing?
just wanted to see.
you know the rules.  you do know the rules, don't you?
yeah, i know.
then start taking them seriously.
yes, ma'am.
now that's sharp. that's real sharp. miss ella mae set you up, didn't she? you like it?
i've had nice things before but i always ruined 'em somehow.
well, this one's yours now. you ready to take care of it?
i don't want you to let go.
maybe i won't.
and now these three remain: faith, hope and love. but the greatest of these is love.  who gives this girl in marriage?
i do.
