besides, i can not believe you would kill me for a field of empty holes.
it is all i have.
your pain runs deep.
what do you know of my pain?
let us explore it together.
where did you get this power?
the power was within you.
i feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. how can i repay you for this miracle?
join my quest.
what is it you seek?
what you seek. what all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. but to find it we will need a starship.
a starship? there are no starships on nimbus iii.
perhaps i have a way to bring one here.
but how?
have faith, my friend. there are more of us than you know.
spock - what are you doing in this neck of the woods?
I am flattered. twelve hundred points of interest in yosemite and you pick me.
i regret to inform you that the record for free-climbing el captain is in no danger of being broken.
I am not trying to break any records. I am doing this because i enjoy it. not to mention the most important reason for climbing a mountain...
and that is?
because it is there.
ah, captain?
mm.?
i do not think you realize the gravity of your situation.
on the contrary. gravity is foremost on my mind. look, I am trying to make an ascent here. why do not you go pester dr mccoy for a while?
i believe dr mccoy is not in the best of moods.
concentration is vital. you must be one with the rock.
spock, i appreciate your concern, but if you do not stop distracting me, I am liable to be one...
oh, god
perhaps "because it is there" is not sufficient reason for climbing a mountain.
borgus frat.
"let's see what she is got," said the captain. and then we found out, did not we?
i know you will whip her into shape, scotty. you always do.
uhura, i thought you were on leave.
and i thought we were supposed to be going together.
oh, i cannot leave her now when she needs me the most.
i had a feeling you would say something like that. so i brought us dinner.
they can not be serious. the ship's in pieces and we have less than a skeleton aboard.
starfleet, are you aware of our currant status?
admit it. we are lost.
all right, we are lost.  but we are making good time.
bad news, gentlemen. shore leave's been cancelled.
rescued at last.
return to prearranged coordinates for pickup.
do not tell them you are lost. you will never live it down.
is there a problem, gentlemen?
um... yes. we have been caught in a blizzard!
and we can not see a thing. request you direct us to the coordinates.
my visual says sunny skies and seventy degrees.
sulu! look! the sun's come out! it is a miracle!
do not worry, fellas. your secret's` safe with me. I will send the shuttlecraft to pick you up.
oh, no. it is not that. i knew i would not die because the two of you were with me.
i do not understand.
I have always known... I will die alone.
what are you doing?
i am preparing to toast a marsh melon.
oh. i believe we are required to engage in a ritual known as the singalong.
that is great. i have not sung around a campfire since i was a boy in iowa. what are we going to sing? what... bones, what are we going to sing?
"pack up your troubles."
are we leaving, captain?
"row, row, row your boat..." i love "row..."  do - do you know "row, row, row, row, row your boat?"
that song did not come up in my research, captain.
the lyrics are - are very simple. it's, er, "row, row, row your boat, gently down the stream. merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, life is but a dream.." the doctor and i will start it off, and then when we give you the signal, you jump in.  doctor, if you please.
come on, spock. why did not you jump in?
i was trying to comprehend the meaning of the words.
captain?
spock, we are on leave. you can call me jim.
jim.
yes, spock?
life is not a dream.
go to sleep, spock.
yes, captain.
goodnight, bones.
goodnight, spock.
goodnight, doctor.










mr. scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. the transporter beam is non-operational. captain, we have received important orders from starlet command.
why did not you beep my communicator?
er... you forgot to take it with you.
you told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. i gave you three. what happened?
i think you gave me too much time, captain.
very well, mr. scott. carry on.
aye, captain  how many times do i have to tell you? the right tool for the right job...
i could use a shower.
yes.
captain, starfleet transmission on line.
put it on the veiwscreen, would you please?
can we have it quiet?
enterprise, this is starfleet operations. come in.
bob?
jim...? well, we are dressing informally, are not we?
you caught me on my way to the shower.
i apologize for canceling shore leave, but look, we have a dangerous situation out on nimbus iii.
on "the planet of galactic peace?"
the same. from what we can make out, a terrorist force has captured the only settlement. and they have taken hostages.
the klingon, the romulan, the federation consuls. now i know enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
with all due respect, the enterprise is a disaster. there must be other ships in the quadrant.
other ships, yes. but no experienced commanders. captain, i need jim kirk.
oh, please.
your orders are to proceed to nimbus iii, assess the situation and avoid a confrontation if possible. above all, however, get those hostages back safely.
have the klingons responded?
no, but you can bet they will.
understood. kirk out.
do not you worry, captain. we will beat those klingon devils even if i have to get out and push.
i hope it will not come to that, mr. scott.



captain, we are receiving the hostage information you requested.
put it on the screen.
not general korrd.
the same. he is apparently fallen out of favor with the klingon high command.
general korrd's military strategies were required learning when i was a cadet at the academy. when they put me out to pasture, i hope i fare better than korrd.
what is it? you look like you have seen a ghost.
perhaps i have, captain. perhaps i have.
spock, what is it? do you know this vulcan?
i cannot be certain.
but he does seem familiar?
he reminds me of someone i knew in my youth.
i do not often think of the past.
who is it he reminds you of?
there was a young student, exceptionally gifted, possessing of great intelligence. it was assumed that one day he would take his place amongst the great scholars of vulcan. but he was a revolutionary.
what do you mean?
the knowledge and experience he sought were forbidden by vulcan belief.
he rejected his logical upbringing and embraced the animal passions of our ancestors.
why?
he believed the key to self-knowledge was emotion, not logic.
when he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from vulcan, never to return.
fascinating.
standard orbit, mr. sulu.
captain, we are receiving transmission from paradise city. they are demanding to know our intentions.
respond with static. let them think we are having difficulty. which would not be far from the truth.
paradise city, can you boost your power? we are barely receiving transmission.
transporter room. status.
scotty here, captain. transporter is still inoperative. even if we could lock onto the hostages, we could not beam them up.
then we will have to get them out the old fashioned way.
klingon vessel now entering quadrant. bird of prey. estimating 1.9 hours until her weapons come to bear.
damn.  let's go.
their equipment is primitive but effective. i recommend we land at coordinate 8563.
that puts us pretty far away from paradise city.
to land any closer would risk detection.
mr. sulu. execute.
this is the starship enterprise.
a federation starship.
this is captain pavel chekov speaking. you are in violation of neutral zone treaty. i advise you to release your hostages at once or suffer the consequences.
your threats amuse me, captain chekov. what consequences did you have in mind?
you are a master of understatement. they are likely to destroy the planet.
then it is fortunate that i have you and your starship to protect me. in the meantime, captain chekov, i instruct you and your first officer to beam down to my coordinates.
we will be happy to beam down. but first we must have certain assurances.
at footspeed i estimate the journey to paradise city at 1.2 hours.
we do not have 1.2 hours.
spock.
yes, captain?
be one with the horse.
yes, captain.
what is going on?
i instruct you to surrender. you are under attack by federation forces.
do you realize what you have done? it was not bloodshed i wanted.
spock, you have developed a sense of humor after all.
it was not my intention to amuse you. these are serious charges. however, if you surrender now-
I am sorry, spock. i can not surrender now. I am not through violating neutral zone treaty. in fact, I am just getting started. and now for my next violation i intend to steal something. something very big.
i must have your starship.
you staged all this to get your hands on my ship?
who are you?
james t. kirk, captain of the enterprise.
but i thought captain chekov..  i see. very clever, captain.  spock, it would appear that you have been given a second chance to join me. what do you say?
i am a starfleet officer.
of course. of course. then I will take the ship without your help.
shuttle en route.
position, bird of prey?
closing.
mr. chekov, I have lost the bird of prey. she must have cloaked.
raise shields.
but the shuttle-
do it. go to red alert.
no! no reply. remain on course.
sybok, listen to me. in order for this craft to enter the landing bay, enterprise must lower the shields and activate the tractor beam. to get us inside and re-raise the shields will take-
exactly 15.5 seconds.
an eternity during which we will be vulnerable to klingon attack. korrd-you tell him.
you must allow us to act.
let me do something.
what is emergency landing plan b?
i do not have a clue.
what are you doing?
in order to lower and raise the shields as quickly as possible, we are going to forego the tractor beam and fly her in manually.
bird of prey bearing one zero five mark two.
go, sulu.


we must change our course at once.
I will take you to the bridge.
sybok, you must surrender.
no. you must kill me.
put him in the brig with captain kirk.  spock, you will accompany me to the bridge?
no. i will not.
you know I am right.
damnit, spock. god damnit!
captain, what have i done -
what you have done is betray every man on this ship.
worse. i have betrayed you. i do not expect you to forgive me.
forgive you? i ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
if you think it would help.
you stay out of this!  why, spock? why? i.. all you had to do was pull the trigger.
if i had pulled the trigger, sybok would be dead.
i ordered you to defend this ship.
you ordered me to kill my brother.
look, the man may be a fellow vulcan, but that doesn't...
no, no, no, captain. you do not understand. sybok also in a son of sarek.
you mean he is your brother brother?  you made that up!
i did not.
you did too. sybok could not possibly be your brother because i happen to know for a fact that you do not have a brother.
technically, you are correct. i do not have a brother.
there, you see? see?
i have a half brother.
i gotta sit down.
exactly. that is correct. sybok's mother was a vulcan princess. upon her death, sybok and i were raised as brothers.
why did not you tell me this before?
i was not disposed to discuss... matters of a personal nature. for that, I am sorry.
he is sorry, see, he is sorry. everything... that makes everything all right. he is sorry, everything's...
sulu, what are you doing?
plotting our new course.
new course? you have no authority.  what is going on here?
pavel.
there is got to be a way out of this place.
this is a new brig, captain. it is escape-proof.
how do you know?
the designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. he failed to escape.
this, er, person... did not by any chance have pointed ears and an unerring capacity for getting his shipmates into trouble, did he?
he did have pointed ears.
following new course. warp seven.
estimating destination in 6.7 hours, present speed.
is it possible?
is what possible?
that he is found it. sha ka ree. the reason sybok left vulcan.
there sha ka ree is fabled to exist.
but the center of the galaxy can not be reached. no ship has ever gone into the great barrier. no probe has ever returned.
sybok possessed the keenest intellect i have ever known.
spock! my only concern is getting the ship back. when that is done and sybok is in here then you can debate sha ka ree until you are green in the face. until then, you are either with me or you are not.
i am here, captain.
that is a little vague, spock -
you are right. I am a little out of practice.  uh....that's an "s."
a "t."
"a"... "n"...uh, "d"... end of word.
new word. "b".. "a"... um...
"c."... "k."
captain, we can not trust anyone now.
if we could send a distress signal...
there is an emergency sending apparatus in the forward observation room.
the only problem is, it is up there. we are down here.
mr. scott, get the transporter working. if we contact a rescue ship we will need it.  which way to the turbo shaft?
head down that tunnel to the hydro vent and turn right. then left at the blowscreen. you can not miss it.
mr. scott, you are amazing.
i believe i have found a faster way.
hmmm?
uh-uh.
it would appear we are too heavy.
it must be all those marsh melons.
spock... the booster rockets.
if i activate them now, captain, we will be propelled upward at an unbelievable rate.
fire the rockets!
spock.
the emergency channel, open.
to anyone within the sound of my voice: this is captain james t. kirk of the federation starship enterprise. if you read me, acknowledge. acknowledge.
...mark two.
mark two. request emergency assistance. acknowledge.


i trust your message was received?
you can not expect us to stand by while you take the ship into the great barrier.
what you fear is the unknown. the people of your planet once believed their world was flat. columbus proved it was round. they said the sound barrier could never be broken. it was broken. they said warp speed could not be achieved. the great barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. it is an extension of personal fear.  captain kirk, i so much want your understanding. i want your respect. are you afraid to hear me out?
I am afraid of nothing.
easy, easy,  easy, scotty. easy. you are back with us.
uhura, i had the strangest dream. i dreamt that a madman had taken over the enterprise.
scotty, dear, he' not a madman.
he is not?
no. sybok has simply put us in touch with feelings we have always been afraid to express.
no, no, no. scotty - scotty... there is so much i want to tell you.
maybe you could wait until I am a wee bit stronger i do not think i could take it in my present condition.  or yours.
sha ka ree. "the scource." "heaven." "eden." call it "qui'tu." to the romulans, it is "vorta vor." the andorian word is.. unpronounceable. still, every culture shares he common dream of a place from which creation sprang. for us, that place will soon be a reality.
the only realty i see is that I am a prisoner on my own ship. what is this power you have to control the minds of my crew?
i do not control minds. i free them.
each man's pain is unique.
i hide no pain.
i know you better than that.
do you?
spock... don't.
it is all right, captain.  proceed.
what is this?
i believe we are witnessing my birth.
spock...  what have you done to my friends?
I have done nothing. this is who they are. did not you know that?
no... i didn't.
now learn something about yourself.
no. i refuse.
spock?
i cannot go with you.
why not?
i belong here.
i do not understand...
sybok, you are my brother, but you do not know me. i am not the outcast boy you left behind those many years ago. since that time i have found myself and my place. i know who i am. and i cannot go with you.
wait!  you know we will never make it through the great barrier.
but if we do, will that convince you that my vision was true?
your vision?
given to me by god.  he waits for us on the other side.
you are mad!
am i? we will see.
about the ship...
the ship needs its captain.
no special conditions?
no conditions.
what makes you think i will not turn us around?
because you, too, must know.
qual se tu?
it is i.  the journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
it was not. the barrier stood between us - but we breached it.
magnificent. you are the first to find me.
we sought only your infinite wisdom.
and how did you breach the barrier?
with a starship!
this starship, could it carry my wisdom beyond the barrier?
it could. yes.
then i shall make use of this starship.
it will be your chariot!
he has his doubts...
you doubt me?
why? why have you done this to my friend?
he doubts me.
sybok - this is not the god of sha ka ree - or any other god!
i do not understand..  reveal yourself to me!
no, no, it is not possible.
bring me the ship or i will destroy you!
the ship....
bring it closer so that i might join with it. do it, or watch these puny things die horribly.
what have i done?
kirk to enterprise. listen carefully...
spock...
sybok.
this is my doing. this is my arrogance... my vanity...
sybok, we must find a way...
no. you must save yourselves. forgive me, brother. forgive me.
i could not help but notice you pain.
my pain?
it runs deep. share it with me.
in firing position. torpedo armed.
but, captain, we are firing directly on your position.
she is got partial power, sir. i might be able to take two of you.
beam up spock and dr. mccoy. now!
spock?
welcome aboard, captain.
spock, i thought i was going to die.
not possible. you were never alone.
maybe he is not out there, bones. maybe he is right here... in the human heart  spock?
i was thinking of sybok. I have lost a brother.
yes. i lost a brother once. i was lucky. i got him back.
