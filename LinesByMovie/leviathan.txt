burritos...enchiladas...
oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
give me a readout, dejesus.
ahhhh!
dejesus!  a readout!
he don't need a readout, man, he needs help!
stay calm!
the internal monitors read normal.
where's doc?!
he's not at his station.
i'm telling you, it's the suits!
fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  it doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
clear for pickup.
let's hope it holds.
doc eat already?
the good doctor hasn't showed yet.
how do you feel, dejesus?
okay.
better let the doc take a look at you, after dinner.
i've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...
uh, oh...i see where this is going...
...all of you owe time and i thought tonight would be a good time to---
no way, mister beck!  <u>no</u> <u>fucking way</u>!  we just did a full shift, you can't call shack duty on top of a full shift.  it's a contract violation!
whooo!  right on, cobb!  let's hear it for our shop steward!
what about our quota?
you're only twenty-five tons off quota.  barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.  it's just a day off.  you don't have to take it, i just thought it might help.
cobb, jones, i want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...  bowman and sixpack...living quarters...
shit...
williams...get dejesus' suit on the "sick rack" and do a diagnostics.  any other suit problems she should know about?
my pocket.  check my pocket, will ya, honey?
your pocket?
the latch is screwed up.  or the hinge.
right.
you did good...
what?
today...with dejesus.  that was smart thinking to get him inside...
there probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...
still...you did the right thing.
are you planning on working tomorrow?
well, i'll be on the golf course in the morning.  then, if i don't have any babies to deliver--
we almost had an accident today. dejesus' suit...
listen to it for christsake.
ah, it's just old, like me. you don't see the doc opening me up every time i get a new creak in my joints...i say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. but, 'long as we're here...
two hundred and fifty-two tons of magnesium and 15 tons of sodium.
sounds like a good week, beck. in fact...i put your folder in front of the vice president of district operations last night...
thank you, martin.
don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'know what i mean?
so that's all you do?...
shhhh...don't tell no one.  job security.
made your million, yet?
not yet.
how's transocean doing?
you got money in this tub?
i signed-up for the stock option.
hey, man, you know that in switzerland--and this country's the size of east l.a., okay?--they speak 54 different dialects? fifty-four!
who cares?
i do, man.  that's a beautiful place.  when i get out of here i'm going there.  find a nice little snow covered chalet, warm little woman, crackling fire--
hey, cobb...man, why don't you take off your shirt and pants, man?  you should do that wearing what you're going to wear at the beach.
this is what i wear at the beach, goddamnit.
you take your money, too seriously, bo.
you're damn right i do.  five years down here and i'll pull in more than 15 topside.  i'm not down here for the fun, i'll tell you that.
hey, bo...when're you going to be off that thing?  i want to find out tonight's nba scores and check the weather.
the weather's good, i already checked, but i'll be off in a minute.
hey, jonesy, who's the best power forward in the nba...jameson?
jameson?  who're you trying to con?
you guys are crazy.  what the hell you play that stupid game for?
what game, cobb?...i'm on my way to nirvana...
you're on your way somewhere all right...the looney bin.
i'm on the way to the looney bin?  hey, man, i'm not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.
bitch!  look what you did!
sorry, darling...just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
look at my foot, sir!  this bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!
how do you know it was williams?
huh?  i...uh...uh...
all right, sixpack, you and williams are gonna pull water duty tomorrow--
oooooh.  damn!  not so loud. turn down the music.
what music?  there ain't no music.
yeah?  how'd the kid hold up?
pretty good.  he sent them out videotaping outcrop.
charge set?
charge set.  backing off.  c'mon rover let's get out of here.
i need more light on that, four.
roger...  more light, sixpack...
that's great.  now let's move 35 degrees southwest.
you screw around like that again and--
what's wrong, did you miss me?
hardly.
don't worry, darlin, i'm...
how far away is she?
two hundred meters.
if he had his blinkers on--
it wouldn't make any difference in there...he could be two feet away and on fire and she'd still not see him!
sixpack?
why can't we pick up his signal?
what the?...
russian.
i'm going inside.
what's your air reading?
twenty minutes...
twenty minutes!...who had tank duty?
who else...sixpack.
the man is unbelievable... i say, leave him in there.
what about his suit?  that's a million five the company's got to replace.  they'll make somebody go get it.
personal effects...
timex...
what is it?
"debbie does dallas"...  hell, it's in russian.  i can't read it...
you read russian?
russian, french, italian, spanish, greek, german, a little hindu, some serbo croat and a smattering of swahili...standard pre-med background...
bullshit.
...and a russian grandmother...
you mind if i take a look at this?
be my guest.
what do you want me to say? that it all sounds mysterious?
these observers were doing something. a test...i think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
what mistakes?  look, i think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have maritime run a check.
something wrong, cobb?
uh..excuse me sir, it's the air recirculating system, sir...
what's wrong with it?
...i'd really have to show it to you.
all right...
cute, dejesus...specimen cups?
aw, loosen up, bowman...  hey, willie, i got one served up for you.
that was a loud one wasn't it?
after a month of it you'd think i'd be used to it.
how's astronaut training?
why?  you going to give me hard time like the others?
no.  i'm just being friendly.
good...it's going good.
whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
i need electrical field experience on my resume. everything helps...  why are you here?
everybody in corporate training serves a tour on the line.  sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.
has it helped?
you think i should hang around more with the crew?
well, i always heard you don't "learn" leadership, you earn it.  how did you know they'd get into the vodka?
i guess i figured if i was in their shoes that's what i would've done.
maybe you're more one of us than you think...sir.
what's wrong?
pretty good imitation of a hangover and i ought to know.
...as long as you know it's not in your contract.
i know that.
well, suit yourself, then...its your decision...  ha ha...a little joke...suit yourself...
how's the weather for pickup tomorrow?
beautiful.
bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with- out his sad self out there. you just can't do it.
he's tanking on us...
no...he's really sick.  i heard him last night.  the company will take that into consideration...
honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire month.
excuse me, sir...
is this a contract violation, mr. cobb?
no sir...i just wanted to know if you needed a hand?
okay, number 23's full.
let's get it out of here and bring in a new one.
yes sir...
hook's on 24...
dead?  this morning you said he had some skin disorder.
he did.
well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you in eight hours?!
here.  put this on.  you examine him.
i'm not a doctor.
for this...you don't need to be.
the mask is because you think it might be...catching?
i don't know.  i've been back and forth with narragansett naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime medicine, the best people in viruses...
and?
and they didn't believe the symptoms i described...
why sixpack?
it could be a million things, something in the air, food....  but he went on that ship and so did williams...  i want to examine the crew.
yeah...right...
"routine," my ass!  ain't nothin' "routine" about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down...especially when we're getting picked up the next day!
he didn't say it was a "routine check-up," he said it was a "routine <u>precaution</u>."
well, according to maritime law, you, as commander of the shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  however, the company doesn't want you to do that.
what you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
but you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
i'm not anxious to find out, either.
beck, trust me.  if the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. we could be there in a few hours.
do it.
unfortunately.  we can't.
what're you saying?  that we're not even going to be picked up tomorrow?
it shouldn't be a long delay.
but it's a delay!  how long? a day?  two days?!
twelve hours, no big deal.  we should know something first thing in the morning.  don't worry.
who were you talking to?
sixpack...
how is he?
sleeping.  no sign of doc, though.  i'll check the control room.  you look in the shower room...
excuse me, sir...bowman's sick.  she's downstairs in the infirmary.
the infirmary?...
yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
we're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
bullshit...i was just talking to him.  i saw him move.
what?...
i can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
and it killed bo?
no...she killed herself.
we're getting out of here just in time.
there's now a problem with the weather for pickup.  there's a typhoon in our sector... ...we're going to be delayed twelve hours...
typhoon?!
twelve hours!
at least we get time and a half.  that's in the contract.
fuck double pay, man!  i want out of here!
c'mon, cobb...you're slacking...
i ain't, goddamnit...it's jones!..
shut up, all of you.
mr. beck, the contract states that no body can be disposed of without authorization of---
hey!...i feel something. it's moving!  he's alive!
i feel it, too...someone's trying to get out.
no!
it bit me!
it's sixpack!
i'm going to kill it!
serves his ass right to get it.  motherfucker brings that shit onboard.  i hope his fucking ass rots in the sea and is shit upon by the fish.
'fucker could have gotten us all killed.
how'd you do that?
what?  that?...i've done this one before.  you hungry?  i'm hungry.
they found this?
no.  i think they isolated him in genetic engineering. homo aquaticus...
was there such a thing?
danakil man?...one of our ancestors.  named for the danakil alps in ethiopia.
not exactly a big ocean country.
it was when it counted a couple of million years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water.  most homo sapiens didn't make it...danakil man... <u>adapted</u>.
some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
but what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit cobb?
why stop with just one aspect of marine life?  why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to offer?...
well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then why's there a dead one onboard that russian ship?  why isn't he out swimming around?
getting some food.
under there?
look.  water.
probably the plumbing.  you gonna make me finish that puzzle by myself, or what?
what's going on?
it's hazy...it's got him! stay here and don't let him out.  i'm going to get the doc.
it's got hazy!
what has?
one of those chunks of sixpack!  like a big leech, with those teeth!...
we've got to get him to the infirmary.
what are you going to do to him?
i'm going to try to remove it.
i've got cobbie downstairs watching the door.
you let him get away!
i ain't doing nothing for that thing without something to defend myself.
that <u>thing</u> happens to be my friend.
oh, god, she's out there...
jones...come with me.  cobb, you and doc check the rooms.
what on earth's the matter with you?
i ought to smack your face!
what's wrong?
dejesus...it's got him.
i thought they were your friends?
were, doss <u>were</u>.
no, it's not going through. the intercom's busted.  i thought dejesus fixed that?
he did.
what happened?
it...almost got you.
what was it?
bigger than dejesus?  how?
it's had a meal.
it needs blood?
fucking great...you telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?
it would explain the suction- like appendages.
like a leech.
that's why there's a dead one on the ship.  it ran out of blood.
what dead one on the ship?
the monster appears to be a genetic aberration...
no fuckin' lie...
...it has many traits of deep sea marine life...regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy...  but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other quality...
that it acquires intelligence from its victims?
intelligence may not be the right word...
fuck semantics, doc! you saying its like part dejesus, part sixpack, part bowman?!
i don't know.  i'm guessing.
i say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!
and hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...no, thank you. i'll take my chance down here.
what can we do?
our only chance is to lure it to the swamp and flush it like we did the other.
be careful with it.
don't worry, i don't want to give up any more.
still bothering you?
itches like hell.
take it off and let me have a look.
cobb's cut...it was in him! it got doc...
oh man, that's just great...
shit!  he sent them all.
the escape bubbles?
what is it?
the good doctor signed our death warrant.
forty-eight hours!
i realize you must have gone through hell--
they know, don't they?
yeah...i think they're just deciding what to do with us.
maybe they already have.
what are you doing?
seeing how my stock's doing...
what is it?
the air's stopped.
we're on backup air.
how much time does that give us?
less than an hour.  it's ruptured an air duct.
can't we fix it?
we don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and--
crunch...implosion.
the shack...
she's wondering what's happening.  we're losing air faster than i thought.
don't spend all day down there.
don't fuckin' worry, i ain't.
jesus christ...
can you fix it?
no way...
think!  can we stop it?! block it up?!  shut down the line somewhere?!  think!
i am thinking, man!  you think i want to die!  i am thinking!  i--
i hit it.  but i can't see it!  can you see it?!
no.
go on!
no!
that's an order!
fuck your orders!
where the hell've you been?
i got hung up!  try this!
your suit, becky!
just get in yours!
wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
roger.
we made it!
where's jones?
are you sure you saw something?
how many times i got to tell you.  i saw a ship.
well, why haven't they answered our flares?
are you okay, jonesy?
tip top, willie...tip top.
who's the best power forward in the nba...jameson?
jameson?  who are you trying to con...?
it saw us!
answer them and quit kicking me!
i'm not touching you!
it hit me!  where are they?!
i can't see them!
