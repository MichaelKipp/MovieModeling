come on.  beats study hall, does not it?
no!
thank you, jimmy.
hey, man, at least in study hail i could meditate.
so, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
i have the feeling, they got it down already.  they are a step ahead of us, artie.
I have got that two of the clock in town.
back to the land of grownups.
if old pictures interest you, come back some time, there is quite a collection down in the pagoda.  I will see you get a proper tour.
I would like that.
you know, i want to thank you for getting me into this class...  no way was my old man going to spring for the fees...
hey, you are working for it.  least you are supposed to be.
okay, try me on sunday.  I am going out to the everglades on saturday.  you guys can wash the mud off.
deal.  you know, i just looked out front.  my ride was not there.  you suppose you could give me one?
what about you, jimbo, you need a ride?
what?
a ride.  you want one?
yeah.  but i got my bike.
do not forget the car wash.
i won't.
is that sam lombardo?
hi, mon.
sam!  hi!
what?  you are going to drive off without even saying hi?
hi, sandy.
why do not you come in, have a drink?
can't.  got a passenger.
i can't, sandy.  I have got to run.
I will bet.  look, sam.  why do not you come by this weekend.  we will take the boat out...
sorry, sandy.  I have got plans.
what?  running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
swamp's where it is at, sandy.  gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of.  you ought to try it some time.
not that I am going to be much good after last night...
eat a power bar.
look, he forgot.  i knew it.
no i didn't.  check out the jeep.  it is nice and dirty for you.  but you might want to wait a minute. the mercedes is leaving.
where is the hose?  we can set up.
in back of the garage.
is that sandra van ryan's kid?
kelly.
she is going to wash your jeep?
senior class fund-raising gig.  i told 'em they could hose down the jeep.  hey, come on.  it is for a good cause.
so, where you off to now?
are not  you forgetting something?  your coupon.  we got to have it.
jeez, that thing... can not you...
rules are rules, mr. lombardo.
all right.  I will have to look for it.
mr. lombardo.  we are running kind of late.  how about if nicole goes on to the mansons?  you could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
sandy... what is up?
listen, kelly skipped school.  have you talked to her?
no.
shit. here we go again.
did not you see her this morning?
to tell you the truth, i have not seen her since friday.
look.  i know you are seeing barbara baxter.  so what?
so maybe I am a one-woman man.
grab a clue, sam.  you are a hired hand around here.  enjoy it while it lasts.
goodbye, sandra.
which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
whichever one i want.
okay, what is the matter?
you notice my new jumper?
my friends buy me clothes, so i do not look like trash.
i would hardly say you look like trash.
no thanks to you.
kelly.  what is it?
i miss dad.
jesus.  well, i do too, sometimes...
no you don't.
he did not have to kill himself, kelly. he could have gone out and gotten a job. christ, he could have found another rich woman... he never had a problem tucking my friends when we were married.
what?
i was raped.  by sam lombardo.
he... sam lombardo?
yes.  god, mom...
you are saying that kelly was raped by sam lombardo.
that is right.
how are you, kelly? would you like to take a break for a minute?
i just want to get it over with.  my mom's making me do this. i just want to forget it.
i know you do.
the next thing... his hand was in my shorts... you know, from behind.  his fingers... his fingers...
take your time.
they were in me.  both places... you know.
i understand.
he said something like, "do you want it dirty7" or something.  i tried to turn away, but he pushed me to the floor.
was there penetration?  did he put himself inside you?
yes.  i said stop.  i screamed.  i mean that is how it sounded in my head.  he hurt me...
that is okay, kelly.  you are doing fine.  but i have to ask you something here. when you say it hurt.  was this the first time a man was inside you?
no.  I have done it a couple of times, i mean with guys i dated.  but this hurt... like, he was built... you know...
he was large?
did you try to fight him?
i... he had my wrists pinned behind me. i remember my hands were cold.'
then what?
he kept saying, "let it happen, let it happen."  then he just stopped.
you mean he withdrew...
not at first.  he was still inside but he was not moving or anything...  he said we had this secret.  and that now he would be able to help me... because we were close... something like that.  i do not know.  it is hard to remember, exactly.
try, kelly.
i know one thing he said.  it was when... when he took himself out and was standing up.  he said, "don't worry, i did not come." i can not forget that.  he said, "no little girl can ever make me come."
why?
i think she is acting.  i think she set it up to be alone with him because she wanted him to come on to her.  i think maybe she is upset that he didn't...
or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
the line i get on this guy, is that he is done half the women in blue bay.
that does not make him a child rapist.  there is something else.  this girl's had some problems.  wrecked a couple of her mom's cars.  ran away...
where is this coming from?
i worked juvenile in dade county for three years.  we had a missing persons on kelly van ryan for two weeks... maybe a year ago... the family kept it out of the papers.
that would make it about the time of her old man's suicide.  you do not think that could explain some erratic behavior?
all I am saying is, i think we should go slow here.
i want a full-scale investigation.
you know what that will mean for lombardo.
i do not care.  you heard that girl's statement.  i think he is dirty.  get me a case.
it is our job, gloria.
hunter's making it our job because sandra van ryan's got a bug up his ass. you know that as well as i do.  we are going to trash this guy's life and i keep asking myself if it is really necessary.
talk to me artie.
kelly van ryan...
... is accusing me of rape.  jimmy told me.  apparently I am the last to know...
sam... i...  sandra van ryan's been on the horn with every member of the school board all day long.  she is pushing for suspension...
this is insane.
all i can tell you sam, is hang in there.  they clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
that is great.  I will just tell my creditors I am not a rapist.  no problem... shit.  i can not believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
the van ryan family created blue bay. they built the school... sandra van ryan calls up the board and says kiss my ass, they say, left, right, or in the middle.  you are going to need some help on this one, sam.  you are going to need a lawyer, and he would better be a good one.
but check this...
ken.  I am in some trouble.  i need an attorney and you are the only one i know. so i figured I would start here.
good thinking.
you can tie whoever did it to sandra van ryan...
forget it.
lady has some deep pockets.  that is all I am saying.
i know how deep her pockets are, ken.  i thought i might be able to save my fucking house with an equity loan. guess who is on the board of directors at the bank?
can not you take that stupid thing off?
not in here.  chiropractor comes in here for lunch sometimes.
you are not in bad shape, really.  i know you think you are, but you are not.  let me tell you why.  sandra van ryan.
what is that supposed to mean?
for you to be getting this kind of heat, for what they have on you... it does not add up.  sandra van ryan's got 'em running scared.  and I will tell you something else, you rush, you get careless.
nellie gail ranch...
sound nice?  it is a fucking drug rehab farm.  it is where kelly van ryan went when her morn fished her out of the swamp.  meanwhile, you get educator of the year i mean there is no way they can put this thing in front of a jury.  shit, they have not even taken your statement yet.  reason?  they are still shoveling dirt and my guess is, they are coming up empty.  now tell me I am right.
there is nothing for them to get.
good.  so what we are going to do is march right to hunter's doorstep.  we are going to insist they take a statement. we are going to tell them to charge your ass or get off your back.  they are walking a fine line here. defamation of character, malicious prosecution...
i just want my life back...
fair enough.  let's go make a statement.
why do not you tell us one more time, how kelly came to be with you, alone in your house.
story's the same, detective...
i had to go look for this coupon.
the one you bought at school.
like i said, i had not really expected to use it.  anyway, I am going through a drawer.  i hear a car.  i look out the window.  i see nicole driving away.  i leave my room, and there is kelly.
in cutoffs, a wet t-shirt.
yes.
and she wanted to talk.
yes.
but you can not tell us what she wanted to talk about.
i could, but it is confidential.  look, the point is, we did not talk.  i told her this was not an appropriate time or place.
and she began to cry.  and you put an arm around her.
yes.  mainly to turn her toward the door.  i told her we would talk on monday, in the office.
and when you turned her toward the door, where did you expect her to go, without a car?
again.  i think we covered this.  i told her i was going to call a cab.
but she ran away.
that is right.
did you call anyone?  did you call her house to see if she got home?  did you call the masons?
no.
were not you a little worried about her...?
there is a strip mall not half a mile from my house.  there is phones there.  i cruised the place, but i did not see her. i figured she was probably there but that she was angry and did not want to be found.  i do not know... maybe i should have called.  but it is not like kelly can not take care of herself.  i figured we would just take it up on monday, in the office.
but you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  is not that against the rules?
it is and i don't.  ordinarily...  but, i mean... there is this kid standing in front of you crying...
with a thirty-five inch bustline in a wet t-shirt with no bra...
fuck you.  this is bullshit.  I am outta here.
sit down, lombardo.
not that stuff about her running away, him trying to find her.  that is bullshit.
what about witnesses?
we have got three.  guy mowing his yard, couple of kids playing hoops.
and what do they say?
same as him.  they saw her come.  they saw her go.  they saw him follow.
still does not explain why he could not catch up with her.  i mean how long does it take to put on a shirt?
we failed to mention the mower guy's a drunk, that he was after more beer and never really saw kelly go into the house, so he can not say how long she was in there.  same with the kids.  they saw her running down the street, but that is it.  with no physical evidence, what do we have?  her word against his.
you are telling me you believe the guy?
all I am saying is, we let sandra van ryan push us too hard, we are going to wind up looking stupid.
you can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  you know what you get? more bark.  and more bark.  there is no core.  tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  and now they can not get rid of them.  they have tried poisons. nothing works.  they do not die.
yeah, well, van ryan got his.  i do not imagine he gives a shit now.
you remember that little girl walked out of our talk at blue bay?
the skinny brunette.
this is where she lives.  she wants to talk.  beats the shit out of me why she would call me at all.  i busted her once for possession.  she wound up doing about six months at camp nine.
you mean camp sixty-nine.
that is what they called it when i was in juvenile.  it is a pretty dismal place.
it is a shithole.  but she was dirty, what was i going to do?
meet my partner, gloria perez.
i did.  at blue balls.
it is celine.  he is okay.  he had a pretty good line on what cheap fucks people are.
so suzie, you called us, remember?
no.
will they?
it does not look like it.
then he will be back at blue balls?
that bothers you?
yeah, maybe, a little.
why is that?
you did not tell me you were going to put me on the fucking news.
we need to tape the interview, suzie. no one will see it but us.  now when was this, that mr. lombardo gave you the ride?
about a year ago.
he dropped jimmy off first?
yeah.
and when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
no.
so you were alone.
yes.
did he come in with you?
i guess.
you guess?  did he or did not he?
yeah... okay... he did
and then what... he touched you?  did you maybe flirt a little...
i wanna go home now.
what did you do then?
shit, what difference does it make... nobody's going to believe me anyway...
suzie!  did this man rape you?
okay!  he did.  he pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.  now, can i go home?
at that point were you able to fight him off?
no.  he stopped by himself.  okay? that is all.  let me go.
he did say something.
what was that?
he said, "no little bitch can ever make me come."
he pushed into me... i could not stop him... it hurt.
I am sorry... you said it hurt?  why?
because... it was the biggest I have ever seen.  and I have seen a lot on their way through jack's fish camp.
ms. toller?
i said he did.
ms. toller.  I am asking you now, under oath, did samuel lonbardo rape you?
this was not my idea.
I am sorry?
he was my friend at first.  then i got busted... he did not even stick up for me.  i had to go away to that hellhole. it is like, you are his favorite, then who cares?  you wanna know something?  when kelly said we should do this, i thought cool, all these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, duquette.  now they are going to get screwed.
your honor... please...
come on, let loose!
i was just thinking about where I am going to stay.  i lost the house.  it is like waking up from a goddamn nightmare.
you will get over it. we have got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker of a lawsuit against sandra van ryan.
just like that?
just like that?  these people ruined your life, bro.
how you doing, artie?
i... you know... i...
kelly...
drop dead... you know where my mom is trying to get the money to pay you off? she is trying to break my trust.  how do you like that?  i can not touch it until she is dead and she will not give me a dime and now she is trying to break it to pay you...
look, kelly... I am sorry... i know what you have been through... i should have seen something like this coning.
jesus christ, what are you doing?
so you got my mom's money.
how much?
about six and a half million dollars.
god, you scared the shit out of me.  you must be crazy coming here.
of course I am crazy.  ask my mom.
how much is about six and a half million divided by three?
jesus.  two million one hundred thirty-three thousand three hundred thirty-three and change.
from now on, if we are seen together, it is got to be accidental.  i thought that was understood...
hey, come on... we have got to have at least one victory party.
the only way we are going to blow this now, is if we do it ourselves...
do it to ourselves?
we have to stick with the plan.
stick?
you saw the news today?
lombardo's settlement?
think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  lombardo had an affair with sandra, right?  so why not tell us about the affair?  i mean it could be a hell of a motive for kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
maybe lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
i thought of that.  then i said, come on, you are lombardo.  your reputation is getting trashed.  you want to stop the bleeding.  you do not want to sit in jail for three months.  unless...
unless what?
unless you are setting up sandra van ryan for the big payday.
they chumped us, gloria, right from the start.
why?  you ask me, lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life.  he is going to put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you are describing...
the job looks okay to us.  but look at it from his point of view.  the man's surrounded by wealth and privilege.  but for him... it is just a reminder of what should have been his.
so what about the girls?  suzie's poor, but why would kelly have to steal from her own mother?  surely her father...
her father did not leave her squat.  the kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can not touch that till her mother dies and sandra seems to have the idea that kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
this one's got you working overtime, has not it?
i flat do not like the guy, glory.  he is dirty.  and I will tell you something else.  you want to know how old man lombardo lost his money?  he was fucked out of it by old man van ryan, on a little item known as the salt creek land deal.  it was after the war.  van ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him.  the freeway went to the coast, right where van ryan wanted it.
eliminate the competition.
you got it.  the rich got richer.  while the saps like lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
where did you come up with this stuff, anyway?
i net a guy in a bar.
is there some reason why you are here?
curiosity, i guess.
about what?  how to improve your breast stroke?
excuse me?
you all gonna go down to the caribbean together?
the thing about it is, threesomes so rarely work out.
you are out of your mind.
I have been a cop for a while, kelly.  it is hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three.  and then there is the love angle.  i mean do you and sam really want that little pill-head around, now that you have the money?
am i right, did sam sell you on the idea right up front, of whacking suzie? that is murder, kelly.
police -- god -- get a life.
will you calm down.  duquette's going to come to you just like he did to me. you are going to have to be ready for him.
yeah, but he can not push you around like he can me.  you have got family and they have got clout.  with we it is different... with me...
yeah, I have got family and they have got clout and now you have me.  right?  and sam.  believe me, suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere.  he is going to try and rattle your cage, and that is it.  stay strong and he can not do shit.
man, i wanna smoke a joint.
you ought to watch it with that shit, suzie.  you get busted again, you go back in a two-tine loser.
you got something against cigarettes?
yeah, they are bad for your health.  I am tryin' to look out for you...
that is cop bullshit.
well, you are half right.  best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
about what?
every triangle I have ever seen never lasts.  somebody is got to go.
is this supposed to mean something to me?  what triangle?
you, kelly, sam.
i do not have to listen to this.  and you can not shove me around.  i have friends now...
is that what you think?  you have friends?  is that what they told you?
i do not mean who you are thinking.  i have other friends...
suzie, suzie... this is me, ray, you are talking to.  we both know you do not have shit, never have had shit, never will have shit...
get away from me.
do not you see what this means?  you really think sam and kelly are going to give you a third of the money?  you, the pill-head with the rap sheet?
shut up.
davy.
that is right.  that was his name.
i can not believe you called sam.  what is the matter with you?
I am scared, that is what.  I am scared there is no one to trust.
you can trust me.
kelly.  is suzie there?
yes.
shit.  i was afraid of that.  she left this garbled message on my machine.  can you calm her down?
why can not you come...
no!  christ.  listen, kelly, I am counting on you.  you calm her down. i mean do whatever you have to, whatever it takes...
you know what it takes.
then do it.  i need you on this kelly. do it tonight.  we will figure something out... okay?
sam...
put kelly on too.
I am here.
okay.  i want you to hear this too. we have got to be cool.  all of us. people think I am rich, for christ's sake.   I am doing what rich guys do.  I am spending my money.  it is more suspicious if i sit around doing nothing.  now do not let this cop fuck with your minds.
but i..
shut up.  do not fall apart.  the only people who can blow this is us. remember?
yeah, right.
good.  just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
you are going to fuck me over, are not you?
oh, for christ's sake.
you are.
are you retarded, or just brain dead from whiffin' fumes out there in the swamp...
are you crazy, ray?
you heard kelly say "sam."  that was lombardo on the phone.  and you saw the girls...
ray.  the conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  what we have here, is you on the van ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
i do not believe I am hearing this.  a month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  they were acting.  they were all acting, from the beginning.  and we bought it, hook, line and sinker... and now they are home free with six million of sandra van ryan's money.
which she might have saved, if she had not set out to destroy the man's life.
what?  you would not go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  cone on.  she bought the same story we did...
oh, ray... no...
you think this is just about money, about us looking foolish?  question him. you are going to find a stone cold manipulative psychopath.  and those girls are going to wind up dead...
guess i kind of lost it there.
you could say that.
were you ever in a situation where you could see a thing coming and you did not do what you could to stop it?
we all have...
i mean something bad, gloria, something bad you saw coning, and you did not do anything, and then it happened.  i did that once.  i do not want to do it again.
you look pretty.
thanks.
hey, I have got it, i may as well spend it, right?  I have always wanted to live where i could dive for my dinner.
and where might that be?
i was thinking, antigua, maybe.
i love antigua.  maybe I will come visit you.
I would like that.
anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
what brain?
what are you looking at?
nothing.
i thought we were goin' to a movie.
i think we just need to get wasted.
i wanna live at the beach someday.
shit.
i was worried about you, suzie.  i decided we should all get together, one more time, before we split up.
are you mad at me?
no, no.  look, i probably should have told you a little more, about the part i intended to play.  we will go through it all again tonight.
I am sorry, kelly.  I am sorry it had to happen like this.  she was losing it...
there was no way.  that cop would have gotten her to tell him... everything. she was weak and dumb...
get off my property.
I am not on your property!
it is starting, gloria.  this is how it begins...
ray.  we do not know anything yet.  she could be anywhere...
I am going to take you back to the office. will you put out a call on suzie's car for me?
you have someplace to be?
if you want company...
just check out the car.
you did not have to fly back -- from -- wherever, for me...
I am here to congratulate my friends and their children.  I am leaving again tonight.
do not bother.  I am taking a trip.
where, the mall?
a friend of mine bought a boat.
it is those rocks, up there.
you and suzie used to come out here together?
yeah, sometimes.  lots of the kids hang out here.  you really think something bad happened to suzie?
lombardo ever come out here?
i say something funny?
no.  but i mean... just the idea that mr. lombardo would...
way i hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
yeah, but...
two kids could have gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
those are suzie toller's teeth.
where is the body?
the swamp, most likely... lombardo's a swamp rat, knows the body will never be found there.  but he is made a mistake.
her grandmother said she would been threatening to run away.  and i found the car at the miami bus terminal.
you do not think sam could have put it there?
how soon can we get something?
we can get blood type right away. dental records will take longer.  you want dna, that can take weeks.
poor dumb suzie, she never had a chance.
we do not know that, ray...
kelly's next, gloria.
get off this ray, now.  if there is any evidence here, it is for homicide.  you get an id, you call me.
will you do me one favor?
ray, you heard him...
what if I am right, gloria?  what if I am right and hunter's wrong?  what do you do if you see a bad thing coming?
stick with me on this gloria.  i need you...
and if the teeth are not suzie's?  you will give this up?
if I am wrong about those teeth -- it is a promise.
merritt, forensics.
the teeth doin' any talkin'?
ray.  stop calling.  i told you the dental records will take time...
what about the blood?
could be hers.  types match.  could be a lot of other people's too...
second you get something on those teeth, i want it
hello?
hello.
god, I have been calling you.
I am really serious.  that cop, he keeps watching me.
duquette.  forget him...
i can not help it.  he gives me the creeps... i mean why was suzie so scared of him?  she is not that way.  i think he did something...
yeah, he got her busted for possession...
i do not know... i think it was something else... suzie says the bust was bullshit...
and you believe her?
i do not know.  i want to see you...
kelly... relax.  take one of your mom's valium or something.  in another week you get on the plane.  it is over.  we are rich.
but what if they find out... god, they would put you in the gas chamber...
so if they are tapping your phone, we are dead.  stay in the guest house.  skip the graduation parties.  you will never see duquette.  okay?  i love you.
okay.  i love you too.
is not that against the law, peeking into windows?
suzie toller is missing.
how long?
she did not cone home last night.  we found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
maybe she used another name.
ray thinks she was murdered.
i do not know what to say...
you could tell me where you were last night.
kelly's file.  read it.  you are going to find an angry, sexually confused girl who is made threats on her mother's life and a female lover she would never identify.
suzie?
I am tired, ray.  I am going home.
where is lombardo?
he is leaving the country.  and i do not give a shit.
the blood type on the rocks matches suzie's.
it is homicide's job now, ray, let 'em do it.  I will tell you something else, there is more to this story than you know, ray... if suzie is dead, i think hunter may be on the right track...
who is it?
detective duquette, ms. van ryan.  let me in.  now.
where is she?
where she lives.  in the guest house. now will you tell me what this is about?
I am placing your daughter under arrest.
you can't...
suzie toller is dead.  you do not want kelly to be next, then take my advice. stay out of my way.
i fucked up.  i lost control of the situation, the one thing they train you for... god, what did i do?
just tell us what happened.
i told kelly van ryan she was under arrest for conspiracy and murder.  i did her rights.
she bit you?
bit, scratched.  but i had her pinned. she calmed down.  i was going to cuff her... she said she thought she was going to be sick.  she asked to use the bathroom.
i told her i was coming with her.  she nodded, like she understood.  we stood up together.
you did not cuff her?
she looked shaky, but lucid.  i thought, i would just go with her, stand at the door...  i think i looked away.  a split second. then, bingo.  just like that.  she puts a knee into my groin.  there was this coffee table between us and the wall.  she got one foot on that thing and launched herself at the gun case.  thing had a glass door.  i could hear it breaking.  i did not go down, but she slowed me up, just enough.  before i could get to her, she would turned on me with this small caliber handgun.  i yelled at her to put it down.  she got off a shot.  i took it in the shoulder.  i... i had no choice. i returned fire.  two rounds, i think. in the chest.
the teeth, were they...
suzie toller's.  and that is the only thing saving your sorry ass.
yeah, well, you fixed that.  what the hell happened, anyway?
the bitch shot me, is what happened.
hey, what did you want me to do, die?
well, shit, you are the cop, they do not teach you to disarm people, shoot them in the leg or something?  you were not supposed to kill her for christ's sake.
did you become squeamish about these things before or after you bludgeoned little suzie toller to death with a wine bottle?  jesus, man. it could not have worked out better. they are convinced kelly whacked suzie. i can not talk 'em out of it.  we should be celebrating.  this thing worked out just like you said, only better.
kelly was supposed to be framed, not killed.  what I am telling you is, i do not like surprises.
gator can not see what is in front of it for shit.  they see out the sides.  that one do not even know walter's arm's in his mouth.
what if something distracts it and it snaps anyway?
then i guess walter can kiss that arm of his goodbye.  he do not use it for no good deeds anyway.
you come all the way out here to watch walter?
i was wondering if i could ask you a few questions.
about suzie?
actually, i was wondering if i might ask you about ray duquette.
he used to come around here.  he had a thing going with one of the girls over at the glades.
got sort of hung up on her, from what hear.
she still work there?
no.  not after that night.  i do not know what happened.  maybe he caught her with some john... all i know is, the next morning the girl was gone and there was a dead boy... indian kid named davy.  used to live down the road there in a wrecked car. him and suzie were at the glades that night.  it was right after that, ray got suzie busted and sent her away.  that is what there is to say about ray duquette.
was there ever any kind of investigation...
you mean this thing?
yes, we call it a winch.  and these are shrouds, and these are stays.
i thought this was supposed to be a vacation.  why did not you buy a nice big power boat?
come on, man.  I will make a sailor out of you yet.
yeah, or get me drowned.
jesus, man... you okay?
that how you planned it?  you take cut suzie, get me to hang it on kelly, then dump me in the ocean...
come off it, man... it was an accident.
you... i should have killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
shoulda, coulda, woulda...  get him in the water.
sam, for godsake.
hey, ray.  guess whose name is on the numbered bank account besides yours and sam's?
that was about as grim as it gets.
the guy was history when he killed kelly.  you knew that.
but then you knew what he was like all along... maybe his killing kelly was a thing you had counted on...
but then it is better this way, do not you think?  no loose ends.
what?
that was the same thing ray said.
what is wrong?
fuck the winch.  i wanna drive.
was not enough van ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  he got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  one trip he showed up with this young girl he would picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  that came with her.
and the child...
she had it, before she drank herself to death.  was not exactly a love child...
suzie.  then you are not her grandmother...
raised her like she was, but no, walter's my only child.  he was a good boy, till the army took him.
so suzie and sandra van ryan were half- sisters.
and the other girl, kelly.  suzie's niece.
you okay?
I am fine.  nice tv.
that never seemed to worry you at the glades.
that is not your line.
say you love me.
i love you.  now give me the line.
no little girl can ever make me come.
seems to like some of the same places you do.  funny you never met.
yeah, real funny.  you are wrong about this, i could get busted on the spot.
trust me, the guy's dirty.  he will like it.  especially the part about offing me.  now get out of here.  go make yourself a new friend.
I have seen you out there in your old air boat, thinking about what might have been, old man van ryan had not fucked you out of it.  what if i told you i had a way we could get a big piece of it back?
we?
well, I would need the famous lombardo charm, not that you would have to do anything you have not done already.
how...
walter.  he is been aimin' that brownie through knotholes for years.  i saw these, i knew he would finally struck gold.  i can not decide which came out better, that little straw kelly's got up her nose, or that vibrator you have got up her ass.  what do you think, mr. lombardo?
i think there is some things you do, you do not want to see yourself doing them.
I am running away.
you think that is wise?
um-huh.  and guess what else?  i have toys.
