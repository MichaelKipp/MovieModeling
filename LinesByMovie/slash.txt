throw me one.
not while you're driving.
-- and keep your eyes on the road.
i'm admiring your costume. what "movie" are you going as again?
sheena, queen of the jungle.
never heard of it.
i'm not surprised. it's got a body count of zero. and no one goes around in a stupid mask, hacking innocent people to death.
you don't like my costume? cool. i'll go with plan b. which one you like better?
is that all you ever think of? suppose i was really hurt!
dammit, karen -- i was just... looking for your pulse.
-- by way of my breasts?
ow!
what's wrong?
nothing. i'll have us back on the road in no time.
hey -- macdonald's farm!
ray -- i'd like to get to the club sometime before dawn.
motherfucking soundman! i couldn't hear myself sing!
i could. you sucked.
hey. fuck you.
where's jack? anybody seen jack?
jesus. what a bunch of useless zombies.
who? us?!
the audience!
yeah. great work, rod. but next time, it would be nice... if you could join us for the entire set!
i was getting 'warmed' up.
get off his case sweetie.
where'd you come from? groupies r us?
fuck you.
fuck me? fuck you!!
time for a little... "feedback" guys. that guy from hectic records --
yeah?
-- picked tonight to come by and watch our set.
shit!
relax. he liked what he saw. well, some of it. enough to give us a showcase audition. one week from today.
yes!
which means we've got one week to start acting like a professional band.
hey. anyone here need lessons, just talk to me.
yeah, i'll teach you a lesson --
okay. my main man. marvin gaye.
easy. gunshot. patricide. next.
curt cobain.
shotgun. suicide. next?
wait a second. did you say "patricide?"
yeah. marvin's old man gunned him down.
that's not patricide. patricide is when you gun down your old man.
all right. "fratricide". minor technical detail.
wrong. fratricide is when you gun down your brother. you're out. my turn.
fine. be that way. jim morrison.
died in the bathtub... if, in fact, he's really dead. next.
asphyxiation. choked to death on a ham sandwich. next.
buzzzzzzzzzz. sorry, wrong answer!
chicken sandwich?
bzzzzzzzzzt!
fuck you! who cares what sandwich the bitch was eating?
hey. could you be a little more insensitive? we're on our way to a funeral for crissake.
yeah. our own. i don't see why we got to go along for the ride.
you never told us you grew up on a farm.
nothing to tell.
my father and i don't exactly see eye to eye.
about what?
name something.
then why go back now?
still trying to figure it out myself.
nike specials. two hundred bucks.
two hundred bucks?? are you crazy?
try taking a left after the next cow pasture.
yeah. that sounds good. "hang a left at the first cow patty, then make a right when you see porky pig".
you know what they say about men who need big guns...
hey. some klu klux klan homeboy gets in my face, he gonna have a few extra holes in his bedsheet.
down boy.
who you callin' "boy?"
bitch.
slut.
witch.
tramp.
yeah. maybe i can pick a little cotton for da masta.
you got something against farm people, keith?
not at all. they lynched my ancestors, they smell like manure, they have sex with their relatives... and they all have two first names: "bobby- joe" --
"peggy-sue" --
-- "billy-jean" --
your pa's waiting for you up at the house.
how'd he know i'd come?
i'd watch your step if i were you, son.
oh yeah? why's that?
you're standing in horseshit.
damn! these are one hundred dollar nikes!
i thought you said two hundred.
what are you going to do? shoot me?
depends. you got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. i bet i could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. now: who are you?
you know who i am. you invited me.
i'm your son. and laureen's son.
ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. my boy was taken from me... far as i'm concerned, he's dead. now, i ain't gonna ask you again. -- who are you?!
joseph macdonald... your son.
joseph macdonald. damn right, boy. and don't you forget it.
i came back for the funeral. that's all.
broke her heart you never visited... but i always said you'd come back.
i'll be gone again tomorrow.
...guess it was her time to go. you can't argue... when the good lord calls you home.
how... was she "called?"
pardon?
aunt edith. how did she... die?
hey! don't use all the hot water!
keep your shirt on! i'm almost done!
bitch.
bitch.
what about jeremiah?
nah. just you.
what is it?!!
spider.
that old barn. after the fire... i rebuilt it nail by nail. just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
this is his room... isn't it?
was. you ain't afraid of ghosts, now are you?
i'll be fine here.
you got it wrong, boy. i'm not the monster you think.
maybe you should tell that to the old lady you tried to hit with the shovel.
i wouldn't pay jesse no mind at all. she's just a crazy old woman. hasn't been right in the head since her husband passed away.  wasn't much right before that, neither.
she was talking about... a "harvest of blood"...
old slave superstition. you sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... so they say.
"blood?"
what's wrong?
this... used to be jethro's room. the attic.
so?
when i was a kid... i was never allowed up here...
i'm talking to the spirit of jethro macdonald. is it okay to have sex in your old attic with your grandson? we'll be careful of the bed --
let it go.
i bet if he were still alive, he'd like to watch.
think of it... as a threesome. you. me. and... "jethro."
i said that's enough!
it's a farm, keith. you're not supposed to shoot the rooster.
he started it.
you seen mac? his bed hasn't been slept in.
what?! you mean... i slept on this couch for nothing?!
we're almost ready. what the hell are you doing out here?
i... heard something... came in here last night. must have gone to sleep.
how'd you get that? playing with your pitchfork?
picked up one of those shears. blade's razor sharp. -- where is everyone?
getting ready.
look. you want to talk about this?
i don't think so. keith's about to use the rooster for target practice. besides... you didn't seem too interested last night.
strange... i can feel my old self coming back...
mmmm -- so can i...
you'll be back.
i don't think so.
let me guess. we're going on a "long trip".
not according to these.
hallelujah! ...civilization... here i come!
amen.
looks like the alternator.
yeah. it's the alternator all right.
how would you know? you're looking at my tits.  jesus, carl. your job is to keep us on the road!
i didn't do anything --
yeah. that's just the problem.
tell me you checked the bus before we left, carl.
just talked to orwell down at the garage. says getting a new alternator for your bus is no problem.
alright!
could take a little while, though.
what's a "little while?"
two.. maybe three days.
rod... i have to get back to my job.
someone actually... employs you?
i happen to be a professional.
which street corner?
she's a tarot card reader at a shopping mall.
what a surprise. -- what about our audition?
hold it, hold it. aren't you forgetting something, rod?
like what?
like your guitar break.
it's coming right up. after the third verse.
second verse!
jeez, what's the difference? just 'cause it's rock 'n roll, doesn't mean it's be set in stone.
you wanna know the difference? the difference is that you're screwing up the song.
yeah. sure. i'm screwing up the song. you're the one who's been two beats behind since we kicked it off.
what the fuck you talking about, man?
he's right. you were behind.
yo. "billy bob". was i two beats behind, or what?
nope.
see?
you were a beat and a quarter behind.
fuck you! if you're such an expert on music, why don't you go get your dueling banjo and sit in on the next song?
i ain't never played a banjo in my life.
you guys figure it out. i'm taking a break.
yeah. good idea. go milk the cows, feed the chickens.
you wouldn't understand.
you never had trouble communicating before.
okay, farm boy. joke's over. you've been playin' me from jump street. where's my nikes?
nikes? what-the-hail you talkin' about?
listen to me, you banjo-dueling, country ass hayseed... i want my nikes and i want them now!
you... think... i... stole... your... fancy shoes? i... wouldn't... be... caught... dead in 'em.
how does it feel, keith?
fuck you! fuck all of you! i'm done kickin' it with cows and roosters. -- and drinking moonshine with johnny cash! senior and junior!
is that right?
yeah, that's right! i'm outta here -- y'all can kiss my city ass goodbye!... i'm gone with the wind.
well, there goes our record deal.
nah. we still got billy bob.
hi.
...hi.
...you any good with those?
you're out of your mind, man.
i am not! i'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
let me get this straight... we're talking about manure?
the ancient aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
cowshit? are you sure the aztecs even had cows?
are you crazy?
sprinkled a pinch of manure in there just before i rolled it.
hmmm. this shit isn't bad.
manure... is life.
you have a strong unfufilled desire.
yeah. to get the hell off this farm.
no. this is something spiritual. an ambition.
the band.
so... what does it do?
it harvests! it threshes! look at these blades.
aha. the lovers.
not lately.
gene.
missed you at church this morning, jeremiah.
you're not going to arrest me for it, are you?
hell, no. but you missed a damn good sermon. "you can't hide a wicked heart from the eyes of the lord."
sounds familiar.
book of jeremiah.
hey, isn't that the preacher?
find out what's holding things up. i want to get the hell off this farm.
thought your boy and his band were only staying the night.
bus broke down.
you know, one day i'm going to have to shut down that still of yours, jeremiah.
well, why don't you hold these as evidence in the meantime.
should we be doing this, dude?
metaphysical question, man.
dammit, carl!!!!
sorry.
there's something weird going on here, suzie.
no shit.
i'm serious. get this. i had a careful look at that alternator. it's clearly been messed with... it's not wear and tear that caused that breakdown...
you're saying someone's trying to keep us on the farm...?
not someone -- mac.
come on --
suzie, face it. the only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. he doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
carl, what are you doing?
you need someone who can protect you, suzie.
"old macdonald... had --"
"-- an axe!"
"with a hack-hack here --"
"and a slash-slash there --"
hi suze.
-- where have you two been?
us? we been... moonlighting.
he means moon shining.
harvest moonshining!
old macdonald had some... moonshine!
where's mac?
who knows? just like a man... never around when you need them.
yeah, man. you were wrong, suze. my solo definitely works better in the second verse.
he's right. nice guitar break.
aaaaaaaaaaaa --
he should turn that music down. jeremiah's gonna kill him.
carl.
carl??? carl did this?!!
last night... he tried to get it on with me.
someone better tell mac.
why bother?
'course, some folks say 'ol jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the macdonalds.
meaning?
hell, he was your grandfather. you know what he did.
maybe you don't want to remember.
what are you talking about?
'course, it's none of my business.
let's say today, we make it your business.
you ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
superstition.
your grandfather sure believed in it. worked pretty good... too.
chicken blood on the crops.
...chicken blood? who said it was... "chicken blood"?
carl! oh carrrrl!
come out, come out wherever you are!
you like it? irrigation system. your grandaddy built it himself. saved the land from dying.
that's a good idea. maybe we should have a little "talk" about grandaddy jethro.
sure. what do you want to know.
people say he was a murderer.
that's your grandfather you're talking about!  i... know what people say. heard it... all my life.
suzie???
the hell with this.  i'm coming back up!!!
we've got to call someone -- get the sheriff--
the sheriff?! we don't need the sheriff!!! we need to get the hell out of here!
then who?! because someone wants another blood harvest. with human blood, jeremiah! just like jethro! who did he kill back then, jeremiah? farmhands? transients? people no one would miss? "crazy old macdonald!" but now... it's starting again, isn't it? someone's picking up where jethro left off!
-- it's not me!
who then, jeremiah?? -- who?!
it gets worse. he's cut all the phone lines.
what'll we do?
suzie --
billy bob's dead. -- we were wrong -- he didn't do anything. i-it's the scarecrow --
wait a minute --
i... saw him -- he tried to kill me -- he's, he's -- still -- out there --
what are --
he's still out there!!!
-- you're not making sense!! what "scarecrow"?
you're... limping.
i hurt my leg. diving away from the harvester -- it almost got me.
suzie... no.
it's you. you and your father.
no --
you brought us here. and that morning i found you in the barn. you had scratches on your face --
listen to me --
you sabotaged the bus! you kept us here... to die! first keith, then carl --
suzie --
no mac, please... i --
don't look.
mac... let's get out of here.
don't you see? whatever's going on... i'm part of it.
get out of here.
no. not without you --
the trap door. that's how he escaped the fire...
you've been... hiding him all these years. helping him... irrigate the land. with blood...
it's time to make amends.
amends...?
think boy. that night. the night of the fire. at the barn. you were only six years old.
i --
...no... mac... p-please...
can't help it, suze... family sticks together...
i almost thought for a second...
never.
