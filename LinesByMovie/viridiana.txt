mother?
I have just had a letter from your uncle. he will not be able to come when you take your vows.
all right, mother.
i hardly know him. i saw him only once, some years ago. i can not even remember him.
in any case he is asking you to come and stay with him.
i do not want to leave the convent, mother.
I am afraid that his health is not good. he is your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. you will certainly never see him again.
but why does he want to see me? he has never bothered about me.
he has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. does that mean so little to you, viridiana?
i have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
the retreat will start soon. you can leave tomorrow morning.
hello.
hello.
welcome, miss. I am ramona, don jaime's servant.
ah! pleased to meet you.
yes, uncle. how are you?
I am well ... the bus was late, was not it? ... what was the journey like?
excellent. what a charming, peaceful place, uncle.
you will think you are still at the convent.
how long are you staying?
a very short while, uncle. I have been given permission to stay only a few days.
was that difficult to get?
no. mother superior told me to come.
did you have so little interest in seeing me?
to tell you the truth, not very much. i cannot lie. i respect you and i am grateful to you because i owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
you have no feelings toward ...
no.
you have been neglecting the farm, uncle.
in twenty years the grass has invaded everything. there are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. i hardly ever go out.
come down here, you scamp.
who is she?
my maid ramona's daughter. she is a little animal.
come down.
how like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
i know, uncle, you have told me that already.
you see, even the voice.
leave me now. you can go to bed.
yes, sir. good night.
good morning, rita. how are we today?
today, a good girl.
could i trouble you for my glass of milk?
what?
yes, yes, i saw you!
how did you see me?
from the terrace.
it is very wicked to spy. why did you do it?
I am going to the hen house. are you coming with me?
no, i do not want to.
I am going to make you a nun's cake. it will make your mouth water.
you are spoiling me too much. i will not know what to do with myself when you have gone.
only because you want it.
what do you mean?
nothing. i did not say anything.
how did you know about that?
oh, some years ago i heard my mother talking about it. but is it true?
yes, it is.
do not you ever see him?
never.
how could anybody behave like that?
sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. sometimes it is because of...
evil.
and what do you know about life? when all is said and done you could not possibly understand.
his mother wanted to keep him. she came from a poor family. i was in love with your aunt. i would like to have acknowledged him but i was afraid of losing her. that is why i did not say anything.
and this innocent child.
do not worry. he will not be forgotten.
you must think i am a monster.
no, but what a pity life is like that.
why do not you ask her to stay on for a few days?
i have asked her but she is ungrateful. sometimes i feel like hitting her. when i talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
sit down, I am going to need your help.
what is the matter?
sit down, woman, sit down.  you like me, do not you?
I would be really ungrateful, if i did not like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when i did not know where to turn.
yes, yes, but there is no need to bring that up. how far are you prepared to help me?
just say the word, sir, and I will do anything.
why do not you speak to her, ramona? women are good at that sort of thing. think of something that will make her stay a few more days.  you are kind, ramona! speak to her. i know i do not need to offer you anything, but, if you are successful in this, I will not forget you or your little girl.
but sir, what can i say to her? and why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
no, uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
then it is penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it is death ...
if you like, i will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave.
thank you, uncle.
this evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
whatever you like.
i should like you to do something for me. it is an innocent sort of thing but I am very set on it.
today i can refuse you nothing.
how strange you are! when i asked you to do this favor for me you refused. you seemed almost offended. and now, here you are, making me so very happy all of a sudden. thank you, my child!
i do not like masquerading, but as you see i decided to give in to your whim.
you must think I am mad.
no, uncle, and now I am pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although i did not think so at first, you are really a good man.
if you only knew ... when i was young i was full of idealism. i wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. but as soon as i tried to do something about it, i became afraid that i would be laughed at and i felt like a fool ... and so i went back into my shell.
was not that cowardice?
no, it is not that, i can assure you. i would not be afraid in the face of real danger. I have proved that to myself. on the other hand, if a stranger visited me simply to say hello, I would be alarmed.
uncle, you must not think that i will not be sad to leave you.
it is up to you entirely. do not leave, then ...
unfortunately ...
it is my fault. if I would come to see you more often, if I would invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
maybe ...
yes, i do not want you ever to leave this house.
you must be out of your mind. I have been so happy these last few days -- now you have spoiled it all.
why are you crying?
I am afraid.
do not invent stories; go to bed.
a black bull came.
a black bull!
it is a very big one.
very, very?
yes -- very, very big!
he could not get through the door, then?
he came in through the cupboard.
you little liar! get out of here!
how do you feel?
i have a headache.
that will soon pass. it is nothing.
what happened to me?
you fainted last night after supper. the master and i carried you here.
have i slept long?
oh, you slept well; do not worry.
leave us alone, ramona.
do not go!
you are lying.
no, it is true.  last night when you were sleeping, i had you all to myself.
think about it. do not hurry. think it over.
go away! leave me alone.
the way she looked at me, ramona! she hates me now. i think I have made a great mistake. she is going away, she is going away and nothing will stop her.
speak to her again. explain everything to her seriously.
what for? she will only look at me that way again ... i couldn't. you go. perhaps she will listen to you. try to convince her.
but what can i say to her, sir?
tell her i lied, that i did not take advantage of her.
let me pass!
you must listen to me before you go.
I have listened to you long enough. let me out.
all that i said just now was a lie. i said it so you would not leave. i only molested you in my thoughts ... i can not bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  tell me you believe what I am saying and I will let you go.
you disgust me... even if what you say is true.
then you will not forgive me?
you believe me, do not you?
yes, sir.
do not lie. you do not believe me either.
it is only that ... it is all very odd, sir.
how do you do, miss viridiana!
is anything the matter, mr. mayor?
you cannot leave ...
why not?
there is been an accident.
where?
come with me.
I will box your ears if you do not show some respect for the dead! you must not play under this tree.
don jaime loved to watch me skip.
good morning. you were not expecting me, were you?
mother.
ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. why did not you write? i would have come immediately.
i had so many things to think about!
a suicide is horrible. i know. but you should have told me.
is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? there must be something.
i have nothing to reproach myself for. all i know is that I have changed. with all my strength, which is not much, i will follow the road that the lord has shown me. one can also serve outside a convent.
are you aware of the pride there is in what you are saying?
forgive me if i have offended you.
you are forgiven. goodbye.
give the little girl to me. come here, sweetheart. are you ready?
when you are, miss.
good, then let's go!
she has the face of an angel. what a pity you can not see her.
right, let's go.  and keep the compliments to yourself. i do not like them.
he was very good. better than some people would think.
why did he kill himself?
i do not know, sir.
one should not be alone the whole time.  I am not like him, am i?
not in that way; you are always looking for company.
why do you say that? perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
so much the better. we will all fit. how many floors are there?
two.
are there many windows?
lots. it is got balconies and two big towers.
then it is a respectable house.
have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
they shut all right now. and the blankets are ready.
miss viridiana ...
are you jorge?
jorge, don jaime's son, at your service.
I have been expecting you; i got a letter from the lawyer.
what is going on, moncho?
this louse is looking for trouble.
do not talk like that!
I will talk the way i want to. I have had enough of this.
in you go! moncho, lead the way!  you stay here.
but, miss ...
would you mind telling me what i did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
I have had a gutful of this.
if you want to stay you will have to exercise a little self-control, and be a bit more humble to everybody.
what is the matter with you?
nothing.
why the bad temper?
it is viridiana. she is getting on my nerves.
she is mad.
no, not mad at all: she is rotten with religion.
let her do what she wants. she does not bother us in any way. she minds her business and we ...
so, ramona!
run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
when i was not so miserable i used to sell pigs. begging your pardon, i was more honest than my holy mother.
so you did not come from the poorhouse!
what about you, manuel?
I am only good at making people laugh.
that is all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I will see to that.
they are varicose veins, miss, but some days i can not take care of them.
are you sure it is not contagious?
they told me it is not at the hospital.
they are varicose veins. it is not leprosy.
I will take him to the doctor tomorrow. come on now, sit down and go on eating. and you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. be understanding. now finish eating and then go to bed. everyone in bed by eight o'clock!
I will come to you tonight.
no, the children sleep with me.
give them to refugio.
no, i do not want to because they yell. and I have got news for you too.
then I will get you in the fields tomorrow ...
jorge. you frightened me. what is happening to you?
it is about time we spoke to each other, is not it?
well... is it so urgent?
if i wait until tomorrow, it will be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. when you are not with your poor people, you are praying or you disappear, i never see you.
i do not know anything about these things, jorge ...
but you have a right to let us know what you think.
I am not interested. do what you think's best.
what do you know about me?
i know that you used to work with an architect.
and do you know that my mother and i had to suffer? if my father had bothered himself a little more about us, I would be an architect now.
i do not understand how you can like being alone so much.
I am not like you, you have your wife.
she looks like a sick marrow!
do not pay any attention to him. it is very good.
me?
come on, miss. just so the virgin can be really pretty.
it will not take but a minute. it is a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. our lady of the helpless granted her a favor.
do you have great devotion for the virgin?
no, miss. smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
smoking makes me feel ill? it is these filthy fag ends. i will not mention in this company what is upsetting you.
it is very good.
thank you; but it is missing something.
that does not matter; i like it.
how much is that?
fifteen yards.
that is fifteen by seven?
that is it.
good.
it is for people!
then let him go and he will follow you.
and let him get run over by somebody else?
he is good at rabbiting and he knows it. when we are in the country, if he does not hunt he does not get fed.
how much do you want for him?
i was not thinking of selling him, but if you want ... I will leave it to you.
and remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
what is he called?
canelo!
have you thought of what you want planted yet?
the fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
it is for wheat. we have always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
and in the vegetable plot?
that is good land.
what are you doing here? get out.
leave him alone.
you will not get much done with those people. those times are over! you ought to let me kick them out.
do they worry you that much, then?
they worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.
there is no point in helping some of them when there are so many others.
i know perfectly well how little i can do. what i want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
is that all you are going to devote your life to?
I am not sure yet. I have had a shock recently, and I am only beginning to get over it. perhaps I will go back to the convent one day.
how are you today?
things seem to be getting better.
hold your arm out. you can not hope to be cured quickly. you heard what the doctor said. if it had been seen to in time ...this'll take time. but with the help of god, we will pull through.
are your parents alive?
parents? nobody cares a damn, what is the use of them!
do not say that.
right, i will not say that, but i still think they are no use.
you will soon find out, you liar!
stop this!
he is lying through his ass!
ask the priest, miss.
that is enough.  go join the others, and do not come back here.  and you will have to control your temper.
if you wake first, wake me up.
what are you going to do?
what i do every day, but i want to do it earlier.
you are happy, are not you!
should not i be? you, on the other hand ...
I am bored. I am alone all day and i do not know what to do.
you should have enough to do in this house ... come here and listen to this.
what are you thinking about?
that your cousin is more to your taste.
she is not my cousin.
it does not make any difference what she is: you like her.
how in hell does it wind up?
i think I would better go tomorrow.
do not be a fool! why rush away from something which could not happen?
you see how much you like her?
that is life. some people are brought together, others are separated. what can we do, if that is the way it happens?
hold on, ramon! is there time to make another trip?
no, sir, it is nearly six o'clock.  okay, let's get a move on!  when are you leaving?
tonight, but I will be back tomorrow afternoon.
are they going to work here too?
do not worry. nobody's going to disturb you.
do not forget the meeting with the lawyer. the car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
I will be ready.
do you intend to stay here for some time?
yes. why?
you can come and live again in the big house if you want. now that I am alone, i can settle down anywhere.
and ...your friend?
she is left.
is she coming back?
no.
why?
you have decided to leave, moncho.
yes!
i can not do anything to make you stay? these people annoy you, is not that it?
and this chest?
there are some curtains and drapes, but they are all very old.
i do not know; i can not remember. but I am sure he loved you.
why?
you would not be here otherwise.
these chairs are in good condition. with a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
i do not know -- they have always been there.
that is stupid! plaster! it can still be used.
keep quiet. these miserable brats only get in the way.
you would like me to kill them?
what will the lady say?
she will not even know.
if everybody agrees, but to make a roast takes four hours.
did not you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
yes, yes.
they have got a real hen house here! you can not hear yourself speak.
tell me the answer to this! what bird lays eggs in a barn?
stop this, stop this.
let me go, don amalio, I will tear her apart.
is it all right?
yes.
enedina's going to take a picture. so we will have a souvenir.
where is the camera?
it is a present from my parents.
don amalio!
what is that?
enedina and paco ...
what about them?
they are playing games behind the couch ...
which couch?
that one.
take me there.
really, don amalio, there is not much point in making a fuss.
they told us you would be back tomorrow ...
i did not want to do it, don jorge. they made me ...
my god, what have you done to him!
he was asking for it.
but why? why?
ramona! ramona!
quiet, my dove. quiet, or I will ...
maybe afterwards he will let me ...
if you free me, you will be a rich man ...
me, rich? come on!
there is plenty of money in this house. piles of it.
i do not want you to untie me. kill him and then I will give you the money.
where is the dough?
kill him and I will tell you. if i do not keep my word, you can kill me too. there are thousands of pesetas. kill him, idiot!
kill him.
that will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.
