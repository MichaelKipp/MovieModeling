mother?
i've just had a letter from your uncle. he won't be able to come when you take your vows.
all right, mother.
i hardly know him. i saw him only once, some years ago. i can't even remember him.
in any case he's asking you to come and stay with him.
i don't want to leave the convent, mother.
i'm afraid that his health is not good. he's your only relative and you ought to say farewell to him before taking your vows. you will certainly never see him again.
but why does he want to see me? he has never bothered about me.
he has paid for your studies and your maintenance, and he has just sent your dowry. does that mean so little to you, viridiana?
i have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
the retreat will start soon. you can leave tomorrow morning.
hello.
hello.
welcome, miss. i'm ramona, don jaime's servant.
ah! pleased to meet you.
yes, uncle. how are you?
i'm well ... the bus was late, wasn't it? ... what was the journey like?
excellent. what a charming, peaceful place, uncle.
you'll think you're still at the convent.
how long are you staying?
a very short while, uncle. i've been given permission to stay only a few days.
was that difficult to get?
no. mother superior told me to come.
did you have so little interest in seeing me?
to tell you the truth, not very much. i cannot lie. i respect you and i am grateful to you because i owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
you have no feelings toward ...
no.
you've been neglecting the farm, uncle.
in twenty years the grass has invaded everything. there are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. i hardly ever go out.
come down here, you scamp.
who is she?
my maid ramona's daughter. she's a little animal.
come down.
how like your aunt you are, even in your walk.
i know, uncle, you've told me that already.
you see, even the voice.
leave me now. you can go to bed.
yes, sir. good night.
good morning, rita. how are we today?
today, a good girl.
could i trouble you for my glass of milk?
what?
yes, yes, i saw you!
how did you see me?
from the terrace.
it's very wicked to spy. why did you do it?
i'm going to the hen house. are you coming with me?
no, i don't want to.
i'm going to make you a nun's cake. it will make your mouth water.
you are spoiling me too much. i won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
only because you want it.
what do you mean?
nothing. i didn't say anything.
how did you know about that?
oh, some years ago i heard my mother talking about it. but is it true?
yes, it is.
don't you ever see him?
never.
how could anybody behave like that?
sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. sometimes it's because of...
evil.
and what do you know about life? when all is said and done you couldn't possibly understand.
his mother wanted to keep him. she came from a poor family. i was in love with your aunt. i would like to have acknowledged him but i was afraid of losing her. that's why i didn't say anything.
and this innocent child.
don't worry. he won't be forgotten.
you must think i am a monster.
no, but what a pity life is like that.
why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
i have asked her but she's ungrateful. sometimes i feel like hitting her. when i talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
sit down, i'm going to need your help.
what's the matter?
sit down, woman, sit down.  you like me, don't you?
i'd be really ungrateful, if i didn't like you, sir; you took me and my little girl in when i didn't know where to turn.
yes, yes, but there's no need to bring that up. how far are you prepared to help me?
just say the word, sir, and i'll do anything.
why don't you speak to her, ramona? women are good at that sort of thing. think of something that will make her stay a few more days.  you are kind, ramona! speak to her. i know i don't need to offer you anything, but, if you're successful in this, i'll not forget you or your little girl.
but sir, what can i say to her? and why should she pay any attention to what a servant tells her?
no, uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
then it's penance for you who are going to be a nun; and for me, who am old, it's death ...
if you like, i will come with you tomorrow to the village when you leave.
thank you, uncle.
this evening we must do something special by way of a farewell.
whatever you like.
i should like you to do something for me. it's an innocent sort of thing but i'm very set on it.
today i can refuse you nothing.
how strange you are! when i asked you to do this favor for me you refused. you seemed almost offended. and now, here you are, making me so very happy all of a sudden. thank you, my child!
i don't like masquerading, but as you see i decided to give in to your whim.
you must think i'm mad.
no, uncle, and now i'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although i didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
if you only knew ... when i was young i was full of idealism. i wanted to do something on a big scale for others, something to show my great love for humanity. but as soon as i tried to do something about it, i became afraid that i would be laughed at and i felt like a fool ... and so i went back into my shell.
wasn't that cowardice?
no, it isn't that, i can assure you. i wouldn't be afraid in the face of real danger. i've proved that to myself. on the other hand, if a stranger visited me simply to say hello, i'd be alarmed.
uncle, you mustn't think that i won't be sad to leave you.
it's up to you entirely. don't leave, then ...
unfortunately ...
it's my fault. if i'd come to see you more often, if i'd invited you here for holidays, maybe everything would be different.
maybe ...
yes, i don't want you ever to leave this house.
you must be out of your mind. i've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
why are you crying?
i'm afraid.
don't invent stories; go to bed.
a black bull came.
a black bull!
it's a very big one.
very, very?
yes -- very, very big!
he couldn't get through the door, then?
he came in through the cupboard.
you little liar! get out of here!
how do you feel?
i have a headache.
that will soon pass. it's nothing.
what happened to me?
you fainted last night after supper. the master and i carried you here.
have i slept long?
oh, you slept well; don't worry.
leave us alone, ramona.
don't go!
you're lying.
no, it's true.  last night when you were sleeping, i had you all to myself.
think about it. don't hurry. think it over.
go away! leave me alone.
the way she looked at me, ramona! she hates me now. i think i've made a great mistake. she's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
speak to her again. explain everything to her seriously.
what for? she'll only look at me that way again ... i couldn't. you go. perhaps she'll listen to you. try to convince her.
but what can i say to her, sir?
tell her i lied, that i didn't take advantage of her.
let me pass!
you must listen to me before you go.
i've listened to you long enough. let me out.
all that i said just now was a lie. i said it so you wouldn't leave. i only molested you in my thoughts ... i can't bear to have you leave me, hating me like this.  tell me you believe what i'm saying and i'll let you go.
you disgust me... even if what you say is true.
then you won't forgive me?
you believe me, don't you?
yes, sir.
don't lie. you don't believe me either.
it's only that ... it's all very odd, sir.
how do you do, miss viridiana!
is anything the matter, mr. mayor?
you cannot leave ...
why not?
there's been an accident.
where?
come with me.
i'll box your ears if you don't show some respect for the dead! you mustn't play under this tree.
don jaime loved to watch me skip.
good morning. you weren't expecting me, were you?
mother.
ever since yesterday, when we heard by chance about the tragedy, we have been very anxious for you. why didn't you write? i would have come immediately.
i had so many things to think about!
a suicide is horrible. i know. but you should have told me.
is there some grave impediment which prevents you from taking your vows? there must be something.
i have nothing to reproach myself for. all i know is that i've changed. with all my strength, which is not much, i will follow the road that the lord has shown me. one can also serve outside a convent.
are you aware of the pride there is in what you're saying?
forgive me if i have offended you.
you are forgiven. goodbye.
give the little girl to me. come here, sweetheart. are you ready?
when you are, miss.
good, then let's go!
she has the face of an angel. what a pity you can't see her.
right, let's go.  and keep the compliments to yourself. i don't like them.
he was very good. better than some people would think.
why did he kill himself?
i don't know, sir.
one shouldn't be alone the whole time.  i'm not like him, am i?
not in that way; you're always looking for company.
why do you say that? perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
so much the better. we'll all fit. how many floors are there?
two.
are there many windows?
lots. it's got balconies and two big towers.
then it's a respectable house.
have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
they shut all right now. and the blankets are ready.
miss viridiana ...
are you jorge?
jorge, don jaime's son, at your service.
i've been expecting you; i got a letter from the lawyer.
what's going on, moncho?
this louse is looking for trouble.
don't talk like that!
i'll talk the way i want to. i've had enough of this.
in you go! moncho, lead the way!  you stay here.
but, miss ...
would you mind telling me what i did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
i've had a gutful of this.
if you want to stay you'll have to exercise a little self-control, and be a bit more humble to everybody.
what's the matter with you?
nothing.
why the bad temper?
it's viridiana. she's getting on my nerves.
she's mad.
no, not mad at all: she's rotten with religion.
let her do what she wants. she doesn't bother us in any way. she minds her business and we ...
so, ramona!
run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
when i wasn't so miserable i used to sell pigs. begging your pardon, i was more honest than my holy mother.
so you didn't come from the poorhouse!
what about you, manuel?
i'm only good at making people laugh.
that's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; i'll see to that.
they're varicose veins, miss, but some days i can't take care of them.
are you sure it isn't contagious?
they told me it isn't at the hospital.
they're varicose veins. it isn't leprosy.
i'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. come on now, sit down and go on eating. and you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. be understanding. now finish eating and then go to bed. everyone in bed by eight o'clock!
i'll come to you tonight.
no, the children sleep with me.
give them to refugio.
no, i don't want to because they yell. and i've got news for you too.
then i'll get you in the fields tomorrow ...
jorge. you frightened me. what's happening to you?
it's about time we spoke to each other, isn't it?
well... is it so urgent?
if i wait until tomorrow, it'll be the same as yesterday and the day before and all the other days. when you're not with your poor people, you're praying or you disappear, i never see you.
i don't know anything about these things, jorge ...
but you have a right to let us know what you think.
i'm not interested. do what you think's best.
what do you know about me?
i know that you used to work with an architect.
and do you know that my mother and i had to suffer? if my father had bothered himself a little more about us, i'd be an architect now.
i don't understand how you can like being alone so much.
i'm not like you, you have your wife.
she looks like a sick marrow!
don't pay any attention to him. it's very good.
me?
come on, miss. just so the virgin can be really pretty.
it won't take but a minute. it's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. our lady of the helpless granted her a favor.
do you have great devotion for the virgin?
no, miss. smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
smoking makes me feel ill? it's these filthy fag ends. i won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
it's very good.
thank you; but it's missing something.
that doesn't matter; i like it.
how much is that?
fifteen yards.
that's fifteen by seven?
that's it.
good.
it's for people!
then let him go and he'll follow you.
and let him get run over by somebody else?
he's good at rabbiting and he knows it. when we're in the country, if he doesn't hunt he doesn't get fed.
how much do you want for him?
i wasn't thinking of selling him, but if you want ... i'll leave it to you.
and remember, the less he eats, the better he runs.
what's he called?
canelo!
have you thought of what you want planted yet?
the fields have been left so long; with a good manuring anything will grow.
it's for wheat. we've always grown maize in the strip above the vegetables.
and in the vegetable plot?
that's good land.
what are you doing here? get out.
leave him alone.
you won't get much done with those people. those times are over! you ought to let me kick them out.
do they worry you that much, then?
they worry me a great deal, and especially because of you.
there's no point in helping some of them when there are so many others.
i know perfectly well how little i can do. what i want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
is that all you're going to devote your life to?
i'm not sure yet. i've had a shock recently, and i'm only beginning to get over it. perhaps i'll go back to the convent one day.
how are you today?
things seem to be getting better.
hold your arm out. you can't hope to be cured quickly. you heard what the doctor said. if it had been seen to in time ...this'll take time. but with the help of god, we'll pull through.
are your parents alive?
parents? nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
don't say that.
right, i won't say that, but i still think they're no use.
you'll soon find out, you liar!
stop this!
he's lying through his ass!
ask the priest, miss.
that's enough.  go join the others, and don't come back here.  and you'll have to control your temper.
if you wake first, wake me up.
what are you going to do?
what i do every day, but i want to do it earlier.
you're happy, aren't you!
shouldn't i be? you, on the other hand ...
i'm bored. i'm alone all day and i don't know what to do.
you should have enough to do in this house ... come here and listen to this.
what are you thinking about?
that your cousin is more to your taste.
she isn't my cousin.
it doesn't make any difference what she is: you like her.
how in hell does it wind up?
i think i'd better go tomorrow.
don't be a fool! why rush away from something which couldn't happen?
you see how much you like her?
that's life. some people are brought together, others are separated. what can we do, if that's the way it happens?
hold on, ramon! is there time to make another trip?
no, sir, it's nearly six o'clock.  okay, let's get a move on!  when are you leaving?
tonight, but i'll be back tomorrow afternoon.
are they going to work here too?
don't worry. nobody's going to disturb you.
don't forget the meeting with the lawyer. the car will pick you up tomorrow morning.
i'll be ready.
do you intend to stay here for some time?
yes. why?
you can come and live again in the big house if you want. now that i'm alone, i can settle down anywhere.
and ...your friend?
she's left.
is she coming back?
no.
why?
you have decided to leave, moncho.
yes!
i can't do anything to make you stay? these people annoy you, isn't that it?
and this chest?
there are some curtains and drapes, but they're all very old.
i don't know; i can't remember. but i'm sure he loved you.
why?
you wouldn't be here otherwise.
these chairs are in good condition. with a little varnish and some new covers this one will be quite presentable.
i don't know -- they've always been there.
that's stupid! plaster! it can still be used.
keep quiet. these miserable brats only get in the way.
you'd like me to kill them?
what will the lady say?
she won't even know.
if everybody agrees, but to make a roast takes four hours.
didn't you say you know how to make vanilla pudding?
yes, yes.
they've got a real hen house here! you can't hear yourself speak.
tell me the answer to this! what bird lays eggs in a barn?
stop this, stop this.
let me go, don amalio, i'll tear her apart.
is it all right?
yes.
enedina's going to take a picture. so we'll have a souvenir.
where's the camera?
it's a present from my parents.
don amalio!
what's that?
enedina and paco ...
what about them?
they're playing games behind the couch ...
which couch?
that one.
take me there.
really, don amalio, there's not much point in making a fuss.
they told us you'd be back tomorrow ...
i didn't want to do it, don jorge. they made me ...
my god, what have you done to him!
he was asking for it.
but why? why?
ramona! ramona!
quiet, my dove. quiet, or i'll ...
maybe afterwards he'll let me ...
if you free me, you'll be a rich man ...
me, rich? come on!
there's plenty of money in this house. piles of it.
i don't want you to untie me. kill him and then i'll give you the money.
where's the dough?
kill him and i'll tell you. if i don't keep my word, you can kill me too. there are thousands of pesetas. kill him, idiot!
kill him.
that will teach you not to bother me any more, you son of a bitch.
