nope...

i'd like to know charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
...charlie, don't you think you should be interested in johnny's payments to me?  i think you should be, you know that.
michael, nobody's out to screw you, i guarrantee that.
i know that charlie but look at my side.  you undersigned the loans. you vouched for him.  what happens if this kid don't pay me?  i gotta collect from you?  i don't want to do that.  i made a deal with him not you, right?
you're right.  you're right.  look, i'm not gonna wind up paying his debts.  you know that.
i don't know that.  that's what i'm telling you.
michael, believe me.  you know the kid's a little crazy sometimes.  i vouched for him and he'll come through.  i promise.  i'll talk to him and straighten him out.  don't worry, ok?
ok.
drinks for everybody tony...
giovanino!  where have you been?
and a double for you and charlie here.  and put it on my tab, willya?
which one, the big tab or the little tab?
put it on the little tab so that it balances with the big one.
yeah, so things'll be even.
how about me?  i don't get a drink john?
of course!  a double for michael, tony.
i know what you're going to say but don't say it.  these drinks are all on the tab.  i'm gonna see you this tuesday payday, i promise.  i give you my word.

what happened to you flash?
charlie, i swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
i know but let's hear it anyway.
i swear to god charlie, it's the truth.

well...no.
you mean it's heisted.
you could say that.
this is a heisted car!
it's the truth, i swear.
all right, forget it.  tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
keep quiet about this.  i don't have any license for him yet.  i've only had him a couple of days. nobody can feed him except me.  i'm the only one he trusts.  watch.
don't go to any trouble.  we believe you... we believe you.
really wanted to get a little tiger charlie, y'know...a little william blake and all that...
be careful.
see what i mean?  a question please...'is this what you call living?'
'take a little tip from mack the knife...'
and i wouldn't call it tony's place or charlie's place...  i'd call it something like season of the witch... get it?
you are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower i know.  like to see what kind of business you'd do.
look who's talking.  pretentious bullshit.  who's the guy with william blake and the tigers, eh?
will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers.  tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what?
we'll close up as soon as everybody leaves.
waddaya think?
not quite...but keep trying.
nah.
c'mon tony, waddaya say?
no.
anybody wanna have a game?
michael, give us a lift.
ok, get in.
yes, you're gettin' it all over my tie.
should i slap him?
just keep him quiet.
friends of yours michael.
shut up.
must have been all the liquor in him.
quiet please.
hey, shut up.
get him in.
disgraceful.
ok...that's it.
out!!!!
c'mon johnny.
you getting out too?
yeah, thanks, it's ok.
i don't think i should go home looking like this.  you think i could stay at your place tonight? your mother's not there is she?
no, she isn't.
you'd better make a move kid.  he thinks you're trying to screw him.
wouldn't bother me.
yeah, big man...get yourself in more trouble.  you make a fool out of him, you're doing the same to me. i signed for you don't forget.
don't worry.  i can handle it.
you couldn't handle shit.  you just better come through with some kind of payment on tuesday...anything. understand?  hold onto your pay- check this week.
there won't be any this week.
what do you mean?
didn't show up.
you sick or what?  you forget what we had to do to get you on the trucks, stupid?
i don't like loading crates.
you're not supposed to like it. what gets me is your attitude. listen... tomorrow you show up.
what about your attitude...where's your job...eh?  you talk and talk and i go to work...what do you do?
i'll tell you what i don't do... i don't owe anybody 2,000 clams plus interest, stupid.  show up or i break both your arms, we understand each other?
ok, ok...take it easy.  i'll show. tuesday i'll give michael something. i promise.
don't promise...just deliver.
ok, now that that's over with...what are you gonna make me for breakfast?
i won't wait until tuesday.  i'll break your arms right now.
listen...i'm a guest here.
hey...you got nothing here.
i could have told you that.
we'll get some food from my aunt's. i'll get in through the fire escape. she's always got something.
i'd like to eat something before i go back to work.
ok, we'll go for lunch.
do you have enough?
well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen...
here.
please take it.
well...
i don't mind.
sure...it's not that...i mean...
it's all right.
well, if things go the way i hope they'll go, this money business will take care of itself.  god willing.
an apartment uptown?  downtown?
maybe, who knows.
charlie...?
nobody knows anything, believe me.
see if you can get your hands on some pamphlets on laws or by laws...or proprietorship...you know...at your place.
anything specific?
you know...like restaurants, night clubs...
what is it now?
don't ask.
alright... hey, did you hear any more about what happened last night?
did you?
no.
christ, you should have seen it. unbelievable.  the kid would turn around and fire and he would just keep coming at him like rasputin. that kid was scared.  not half as much as we were though.
it doesn't make any sense.  he wouldn't shoot him just because he insulted a racket guy...not unless it was personal.
you missed the point.  the kid's a climber...not very bright...but if you get down to his level to look at it his way; he kills a guy who insulted a big man - he gets a reputation.  he thinks he's in good standing.
it's still sick.
not sick...just stupid.  speaking of stupid, your cousin last night was feeling so good he decided to break into your mother's house...to get some food.
hey...you're here.  they told me you're here...and you're here.  how are you?
ok, how's everything going?
don't ask...do you have any idea what i've been doing all morning...eh?
no.
i was in the basement fixing the pipes.  would you believe that?
what pipes?
what pipes...the ones from last year...those pipes.
look charlie, you're a good boy. will you just tell your uncle that i have nothing.  there is nothing to give him.  no envelopes with cash inside, no checks, nothing.
that bad, huh?
i can't make this week's payment and if this keeps up not next week's either.
not next week's either...listen...you tell that to giovanni, not me.
listen, i should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  i don't need this aggravation.  i'm getting old.
he'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
your uncle's a good man...i won't stick him.  either he gets the money or the place and right now he's getting the place.  and tell me why should i care?  i got a partner who's a bum, who doesn't help out...who disappears and leaves me with all the problems.  i should go back to florida...i don't need this.
i don't understand, where's groppi?
i should know?  his wife don't even know.  probably off with one of his little girls...i don't know.  i tell you, if he don't give a damn, then i don't give a damn...why should i kill myself?
my uncle figured that this week was bad...but about next week...i dunno. maybe you should speak to him yourself.
what can i say?
uncle, how are you feeling?
fine.  did you have a good time last night?
about that shooting last night...i was there and...
no you weren't.
you're right uncle.  i must have gotten it confused with something else.
yes, you did.
about oscar...i think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. he can't make the payments...i don't know what to make of it.  he says groppi's run off with a girl. i could help if you want.
no...his business is bad.  but i'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you.
c'mon charlie...one more day.  i'll call in sick for work.
no...we can come back in a couple of weeks.  besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right.
ok.
bore.
a paper on that one too?
yeah...but don't worry about that now.  the hemmingway one is first.
it was nothing.  i'm almost finished.
take your time.  i don't care.
i know you don't.  you've been very preoccupied lately.
that's the word...preoccupied.
see that...know who lives there? the name george earhardt mean anything to you?
sure...he lives there?
no.  of course he lives there. would i point it out to you if he didn't?
that w.a.s.p. bastard.
you're intolerable today.
watch your language.
i'm going to take that apartment uptown.
uhuh...probably a good idea.  why don't you do it this time?
you know why...with my parents.
well you can't blame them in a way.
i can take care of myself.  you know that.
i know...i know.
...he must have heard the name from those t.v.'s in the hall that were blaring all the time.  i remember guevara was in town at the time. must've heard it from there i guess...but that's funny, isn't it?
ummmmmmmmmmmmm.
of all people.  now say the truth. do i look like che guevara.  c'mon.
i'm sleepy.
you've been running round too much. bet you've been forgetting your medicine.
the green capsules in the top drawer.
isn't this jack groppi's place?
yeah.  but he ain't here now.
know where he is?
follow me.
take a drink!
ok.
hey, where you been?
oh...around...why?
you heard what happened to groppi, eh?
who me? ...no, i don't know, not me...all i know is...
our friend, groppi, went to his mother's house.  and when he was there...at night...
oh michael, look...
nevamind 'look'...this punk bastard...i call him at work...i say 'johnny boy there?'...he doesn't even show up for work anymore...
look...i've talked to him and i've talked to him...what more can i do...?  tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok?
all right...but understand, i don't like being taken advantage of.  i mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...this is embarassing.
we'll settle it tonight.
sssh!  quiet.  y'know that's illegal.
well the guy over there said...
yeah, yeah, never mind.  you gotta be careful.
we went down to chinatown but they don't have any.
yeah, well, keep away from those chinx.  they don't have shit.
well, we got $40, and we wanna buy...
all right!  quiet!  for $40 i could give you...
well, i don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
hey!  you want good stuff, or you want shit?
well, we want good stuff.
well, my stuff comes from maryland... you know what that means?
no.
that means it's good.
you got sparklers?
yeah.
and cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets?
ok.  for another $5.00 a special on the packs.
no, all we got is $40.
you sure?
yeah.
ok.  wait here.
ok, you guys get out, and wait here for me.
why?
i gotta get the stuff.
can't we come with you?
nobody sees where i get the stuff. that's good business.  i'll be back in thirty minutes.
hey hold it!  gimmie the cash.
uh...can we give you a check?
a check?  what the...hey, where you kids from?
riverdale.
well, maybe they do that in riverdale, but down here we take cash.  now, you got it or not?
how much?
not bad.  $20.  here, $5.
can you spare it?
sure.
thanks.
what's a'matter?
nothin'.  just stiffed those kids. don't want'em comin' back and findin' you...start asking you questions.
how much?
$20.
let's go to the movies...on you.
yeah.
ok guys...have a heart.  this is my business.
may god be with you.
'and with your spirit.'
salute!!!
'art thou the king of the jews'?
'dost thou say this of thyself, or have others told thee of me?'
'my kingdom is not of this world. if my kingdom were of this world my followers would have fought that i might not be delivered to the jews. but, as it is my kingdom is not from here.'
'thou art then a king?'
'thou sayest it; i am a king.  this is why i was born and why i have come into this world, to bear witness to the truth.  everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.'
prophesy to us, oh christ!  who is it that struck thee?
i don't know, but god help him if he does it again!
well, he isn't.  nice...real nice.
he'll be here.  look, take this for now.
you kiddin.  the way it is now this isn't even interest for two hours.
how much was the original loan again?
$500.  he borrowed that because he wanted to pay off his other loans... now, counting the interest...it's almost $3,000.
$3,000.  shit!  can we hold it at $3,000?
charlie, this is business.
'but i say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
i'll tell you who you can pray for... next payday, i'll be at tony's place...johnny better show or i find him and break his legs...and i mean it.
'but i say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
he could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money...
'amen i say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.'
you said it.
the building on the corner.  that one!  he's been on the roof a half hour now!
now don't get excited.  don't get excited!!
don't come any closer!!!
cut it out stupid.  it's me.
hey...don't do that...i'm only scaring them.
stupid bastard...you get your cousin half-sick over this.
let's get out of here.
did you see them run!
i swear to god charlie...my arm still hurts from the car accident...that's why i didn't go to work.  i swear it.
that's not going to help.
i'm going to work this week...i mean it.
it's impossible for you to catch up on the loan now...the interest is going up...$3,000...do you realize that, flash?
i'm sorry charlie...i didn't mean it.
big deal...in the meantime, it's done...i'll still try to help you out...you know that...but you gotta show some effort...some respect... understand?
charlie, you know the best way to take care of this whole mess.
how?
if you had a little talk with your uncle...if anybody can do it, he can.
that'll help you out fine.  that's the best way for you, not for me! i swear to god, i'll rip you open if my uncle ever hears a word about this.  you understand?  i don't care what happens, he doesn't find out.
i don't get involved with anything, you understand that?  nothing!  i'm clean as far as you know...right?
yeah, take it easy.  will you relax.
that's what i get for getting involved.  look, on pay-day at least show up at tony's place to meet him, ok?  this way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  if you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  i'm not asking i'm telling you!!
i understand.
i really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...henning?  heming?
hemmingway.  killed himself.  i was more upset about that than about groppi, that's for sure.
you know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this hemin fella...to read, so i read it.
wasn't a book...was a short story.
what was it?
nothing.
no, c'mon...y'know, i read.
"francis macomber."
wha?
"short happy life of francis macomber."
oh yeah...didn't read it but i saw the movie...gregory peck...pretty good.
oh yes, he's pretty good.
what i don't understand is why you have to go to college to read these books that you're gonna read anyway.
it's only a couple of courses...just for the draft.
charlie, couple of courses isn't enough to get you student deferred... i mean if they wanted to draft you, you would've been drafted by now.
...but it's the same thing, all the same...they're in there by having something on somebody...and when that doesn't work...they fight...our life has honor...we have no show to put on because we do what we have to do.  they know where to come when they need us.  i realize this during the war...world war ii...vito genovese... during wwii he worked with the government, taking care of the docks...
what did he do?
his whole family has problems...his cousin, the girl who lives next door to you...
teresa.
...the one who's sick, right?  in the head.
no, she's got epilepsy.
yeah.  that's what i said, sick in the head.
her mother and father come to me and ask advice...she wants to leave...get her own apartment...worries them sick...what am i gonna tell them?  lock her up?
what do they expect you to say?
who knows?  it's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like.  when the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know i'm "cumpari" with them...so i take an interest.  you live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved.
all right.
why don't you take a look around the place if you want?
oh, that's ok...i've been in and out of this place fifty times.
well, maybe you missed something?
oh yeah, that's a possibility.
next time, bet with your own kind.
the number was 235 - i bet it combination.
it'll be ok - i know those guys. they won't stiff you.
i bet 235.  because i dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when i dreamt...
scumbag--
shut up.
lower the fuckin music--i can't hear nothin.
the girls like it loud.
girls?  you call those skanks girls?!
what's the matter with this kid?
i feel fine--nothing wrong with me.
keep your mouth shut.
you tell me that in front of these creeps?
don't count it...it's all there.
count it.
hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends.
you got some mouth!
johnny, you're a real jerk-off.
no, really, i liked it...thought it was great.
thanks.
what are your plans?
well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and...
great...great...listen, i'm very interested in you guys because i'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out...
sounds good.
of course, 'the season of the witch' won't be ready for a while yet but we have to keep in touch.
teresa?...yeah, charlie.  listen, i'm looking for your cousin.  yeah, well today's tuesday, payday.  i haven't seen him all day...no...well, have you got any idea where he is?  i know it's early yet but i'm just getting worried that's all...
charlie...i've got to see you.  i want to talk...
honey, i can't talk now...i've gotta run, bye.
but...
diane, how are you feeling?
fine.
you know diane...i've been wanting to talk to you for a while now...er... a...  aside from all that joking around we do out there...when you're on...i... a...i really...think that you're a terrific performer...
fine.
no, i'm serious...you're really good.
i know.
in a little while...i'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
that's nice.
i was thinking maybe you'd do very nicely for the place.
stripper?
no...no stripping...as the hostess.
hostess?
yeah, you know...you greet the people...see them to their tables... well...it'll be different though... listen...why don't we get together and talk after your show tonight.
chinese food?
ok.  chinese.  we'll meet on the corner of 6th avenue and waverly place after you finish.
why not here...ok nevermind...6th avenue and waverly.
bye.
be seeing you and johnny tonight... here...right?
we'll be here.
look, michael, i'll get him here. what do you want me to do, kill him?
whatever.
are you sure he didn't say anything to you about tonight?
for god's sakes...i told you before...nothing.  charlie, i can't stay in here too long at this hour...will you please listen to me?
shut up!
yeah, teresa, shut up!  we don't wanna get charlie here in trouble, do we?...we love charlie.
your cousin here was getting sick, worrying about you.  we've been in here calling...
oh, that's too bad, teresa...
well kids...have the bans been announced yet?
don't be smart.
i'm not smart...i'm stupid, remember. i'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember?
johnny, i swear to god, if you open your mouth about any of this...
me?  i wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, charlie...
you threaten me with my uncle? after what i'm doing for you?
what you're doing for me isn't worth it...believe me!
take it.  i'm doing it for you, stupid!
no you're not...
oh, cut it out, will ya?
charlie, twenty-eight bucks is nothing.  the only way to do it is through your uncle...think about it will you?
no!!!  what do you think i am, crazy???
no, i just want to help myself, that's all.
come on.
don't you move!!!
i'll be here.  don't worry.
back so soon.
mind your own business.
who's the girl?
jewish...
how do you know?
look at her.
she don't look jewish.
sure she is.  she's always in here with some different guy.  you know the way they are.
it's obvious that the girl doesn't want to accompany you, isn't it?
look fella...this is private...
nothing's private...
whether she wants to or not...she's not going.
let go of her.
hello, michael.  i've got something for you...not much...but...
he has about twenty-eight bucks... it's all he has on him.
where's the rest?
yeah, where's the rest?
you're really crazy.
you're not going to use that gun, johnny.
get out of here before this really goes up.
hide the gun.  throw it away. anything.  listen, i gotta borrow your car...i think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what i mean?
ok...but go to a movie first or something...not good to be driving around right away.  you know you can't do much for him now...it's out of your hands.
i think we should see your uncle.
no.
this can't be settled any other way now...i'll take full blame.
forget it.
what are you going to do?  hide me?
good idea.
where to?
kennedy.
i know, i know, stupid.  i mean where you goin'?
it's an open ticket.  i can go anywhere up to $350.
so?
so i'll send you a postcard from wherever.  if i get there.
nervous?
yeah.
you flew before?
no.
hey, come on...
take it easy.  i only asked because maybe i could, you know, let you have a little something.
yeah, well thanks, but i got enough to hold me.  my mother can send me some.  i don't know.
how about teresa?  i could talk...
listen, i appreciate it, but i'll handle it myself.  i'll write.
and say what?
i'll say that i'm travelling.
listen, try a place with some sun. swimming pools.  palm trees.  girls in little french bathing suits.
thanks for the ride.
panther...
panther!  same thing...
hey...no more good times like before.  until you come back.
sure.  and you're gonna take the vows next tuesday, right.
yeah, i'm gonna worry about you, too.
