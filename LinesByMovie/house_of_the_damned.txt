i could use a little help. we have to return the van soon.
ok ok...we're just going to head inside here...
can i have this room daddy?
sure.  did you see the others?
i want this one, daddy.
ok.  if you want this room, you can have it.
now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
yeah I will look into that tonight.
i hope we have more success than we did with the cleaning service.
the place is pretty dusty.
well the realtor said that was going to be taken care of and it wasn't.  I will have to call her.
who knows...  we have to get used to living around here.  maybe good help is hard to find.
must be...
what is the matter?
will, maybe we should have separate bedrooms for a while.
oh come on...
i just, i do not know...
what will aubrey think?
aubrey knows more about us than you think.
well maybe we do not need to remind her of it.  she has a lot more to adjust to...new friends, new schools...it would be good if she had a stable family environment.
you did not think much about that before.
look, i thought we were all right on this, maura.  it is over.  you know that.
it is just going to take a while.
whatever you say.
to our family.
to our family.
i wish i knew more about her.
did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
not really.  she was just one of those names you hear growing up. you know, so-and-so who lives in ireland.  i really do not think anyone knew about this place.
or what she was worth.
god rest her soul.
i do not think she willed it to me out of sentiment.  she did not even know who i was.  it is just... tradition.
you must be the new tenants.
and you...are?
my name is father seamus.  I am from holy rood church.
how can i help you?
you must be a londrigan.
yes, i am.
...at her request.  she was a very religious woman.
oh, that is nice...
may i come in?
what is he doing daddy?
he is blessing the house.
why?
for good luck honey.
thank you.  i believe she would have wanted it.
did you know her very well?
she attended the church for years. a dear woman, it was sad to see her decline so rapidly.
it was a shame.
in her later years she would often get very disoriented being alone here.  she would call me, and i would come by.
what was she afraid of?
well, i believe her mind was playing tricks on her, god rest her soul.  she would hear things, see things...
well it is nice that you were there for her.
i took pity on the poor woman. this house is too big for one person to live alone in...
did you grow up in ireland mister?
that is father, aubrey. seamus well yes i did.  lived here my whole life.
did you ever see a leprechaun?
can we leave out a bowl of milk, mommy?
sure.
did you have dinner, father?  we have plenty.
well thank you for the offer,  but i really have to go.
i hope everything works out for you, and you find happiness in your new home.
thank you.
perhaps I will see you in church.
well there is no time like the present.  good night.
good night.
are you playing tricks on me?
what?
it is not going to work.  I am too smart for you.
what the hell is that?
i do not know.  that is strange.
no.  maybe it was aubrey.
she is asleep.  i think that is what i need, too. I am starting to see things.
yeah, well I will be joining you shortly.  i just want to...
...set up some more things.
ok.
look daddy!  it is empty!
that is great, honey.
mommy, the leprechauns drank the milk last night.
well i bet you they are happy.
can i do it again tonight?
we will have every leprechaun in ireland here honey.
the heater's here.
were you fooling with the power?
no.
did not you just see the power go off and on?  i just had a bulb break on me!
what is it?
it was in the cellar.  weird.
well something just happened to the power upstairs... maura heads off and shakes her head, troubled by the event -
do not play games with me, little girl.
i did not do anything, mommy.
well then who did?!
maybe it was colleen...
who...is colleen?
weird sounds, things moving, lights going off.  the videotape...
so what are you saying?
i do not know what I am saying.
but do you agree with me?
yeah, I would say some weird things have happened.
well what do you think it is?
well, i try to keep an open mind, but...
maybe eliza was not so crazy after all.
there is got to be an explanation. it could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something.  who knows?  i do not know, i think it is kind of interesting.
well what power lines, will?  where?  maybe we should call someone about it.
who?
i do not know.  someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
oh come on!
what about keeping an open mind?
just because i have an open mind does not mean I am going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
voodoo stick?  it is nothing like that will.  you are just being cynical.
I am being realistic.  look, i have a spiritual side.  i mean, we had a priest come in and bless the house.  that should count for something.
it is going to hurt us!
no it will not - no it won't!
it just disappeared.  literally.
I am sure this sounds crazy to you.
not at all.  I am just trying to put together all the evidence, to determine what it could possibly be.
well that is what we are here for. i mean -
we do not know.
i could see if i detect the presence of something.
no.  but I am a clairvoyant.  i can sometimes talk to unhappy spirits inhabiting a certain place.
oh.
well it all depends on how much money you want to spend.  a standard visit would run you about fifty pounds.  that would include myself and an assistant.
and what would you do?
well, we could bring in special equipment, monitors, sound devices, things like that.
i think we should do it.
we are usually successful in detecting the source of most problems.  unfortunately.
what do you mean, unfortunately?
we usually find nothing.  we have debunked many a reported haunting. about ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
what about the other five percent?
they do not build them like this anymore.
suppose not.
where is your daughter?  she might be able to give us some information.
she is at school.  we have tried not to upset her more than she is been.
i feel something.  it is faint, but...it's there...
you say you saw some activity here?
whoa there...
are you ok?
looks like we have some animal hairs in here.  maybe some kind of a rodent.
so is that what all this is? someone have a problem with us living here?
not someone.  something. I have never felt a presence that strong before.
ok, so we have a...presence.  what do we do about it?
if we have a troubled spirit here, we have to find out why it is troubled.
town records are coming up now.
what will they tell you?
I will be able to do a search, to find out who lived here previously.  and who died here.
do you have any other physical evidence, that we can look at?
not really.  oh, wait a minute.
where did you find this?
it was nailed to the cellar wall.
i see some faint lettering.  it appears to be the...runic alphabet?
runic?
I am not sure, but i can check.  did the events start before or after you discovered this?
before.
do you mind if i borrow it?
not at all, if it can help.
damn it.
what is the matter?
these records only go back to 1880. but...  ...wait a minute...
did you find something?
i did a cross search, death certificates with this address. james and marion foster.  they had a daughter.  right here, it says james died, 1882, pneumonia. marion dies september the next year. suicide.
it does not say.  but that is not what interests me.  there is no death certificate for the daughter.  anywhere.
what was her name?
colleen.
honey, is not your friend's name colleen?
yes.
can you talk to her?
she talks to me.
what are you talking about?
she has a...friend.  colleen.
a friend?
you, an imaginary friend.  that is what she calls her.
she says she is lonely...
where is she?
she is here.
where is she now?
she is hiding.
she is down...
she is down...how do you mean honey?
she is down.  help her...
take me to her.
there is something in there.
what?
there is something through that wall!
well what is it!
i do not know!  trust what I am saying, we have to open this wall!
may you find the peace you have sought in vain for so long.
that poor little girl.
so many unanswered questions.  why was she buried there.  and who killed her?
it might have been her mother.
we do not have proof of that.
the style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era marion foster killed herself.  who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
we will never know for sure.
hopefully the whole sad chapter is over.  and everyone, including your family, will find peace. will i just want to...thank all of you, for everything you have done for us.
you have done your homework, mrs. south.
maura.
maura.
yeah, they told us this was the best.
i have to admit you really have a beautiful home.
thank you.  if you told me two years ago we would be living here, i would never have believed it.  do you live around here?
no, i live about in wexford.  it is about a five hour drive.
how did you meet dr. shea?
there were a series of lectures about parapsychology at my university.  i went and heard him speak, and became fascinated with the idea of hunting ghosts.
i have to admit i was skeptical.  until now.
so was i.  the usual investigation turns up nothing more times than not.
well, i guess this whole thing was as strange for you as it was for us.
yes.  it was.
how are we doing?
i think everything's ready.
good.  I will start bringing things in.
aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
ok...
I am hungry enough to eat a horse.
you will have to settle for turkey.
it looks delicious...
why do not you pass me your plate?
is white meat all right for you, mr. shea?
white meat will be fine...
oh my god where is she!
she is gone!
aubrey?!  aubrey?!
aubrey!
aubrey!
did you find her?!
no!
this is not happening...
the amulet...
what...amulet?
did you remove anything in the cellar!
your daughter's been taken.
what!
i said nothing before, for fear you would not believe me.  I have been here before to cast evil from this house.  the amulet is a guard against evil, blessed in countless rituals.   it is an ancient ceremony of the early catholic church, a ceremony whose secrets are all but lost.
so what does that have to do with aubrey!  where is she!
we must return it, if you want your daughter back.
what are you getting at!
i said nothing before, for fear you would not believe me.  I have exorcised forces from this house. eliza knew, she was there.  it wants another soul, the one we have taken away. we must weaken it!
where does this amulet come from?
it is origin is unknown.  the symbol does correspond  to a dagger i acquired many years ago.
the dagger is used to free those possessed if stabbed directly into the heart, according to ancient beliefs -
by killing them?
by freeing them.
i do not understand.
the knife destroys the evil and saves the soul of the possessed.
what do these ingredients mean?
pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... onyx is the sickle, death...
I am going to need some blood.  it must be from a woman.
why?
the blood of a woman is birth, life. it is part of the ceremony. seamus offers up the pin - maura waits a beat, then takes it -
how long will it take!
it will not take long...
now you must listen to me. this force is like a parasite, or a virus. it feeds on doubt, suspicion, discord... you must clear your mind as we reach out for her.
so what should we do, father?
go ahead.  i believe right now she may hear you.
aubrey?  it is mommy.
help me!  please!!!
my god, i heard something!
we are here aubrey!  look, do not be afraid.  we want you to come back to us...
it is dark!  i can not breathe!
keep talking!
it can not hurt you if you are not afraid aubrey.  think about us. we are here for you, we love you...
i can not move!
fight it back aubrey.  fight it back as hard as you can!
concentrate!  she can hear you!
come back to us honey, do not be afraid!
mommy please help me!
do not be afraid!
daddy, please!!!
she is coming back.  keep talking!
come back to us honey!
oh my god!  she is in there!
daddy help!
my angel!
I am scared!
the rain is letting up.
yes it is. will and seamus look at each other -
i do not know what happened... and i do not know what you did...
i did not do anything...god saved her...
what is going to happen?
i wish i had an answer.  evil is powerful, more so every day it seems.  but i believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
take care of the girl.  take care of your family.  they are important.
yes, they are.
well, you know where to reach me. the church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass.
we will be there.
are you all right?
a few years older, perhaps.
how is your arm?
it will heal.
I am sorry.
there is no need to be.
are we leaving mommy?
yes, we will be leaving soon.
good-bye.
good-bye.
are we going back to california daddy?
well, that all depends.
it does not matter to me.  what do you mean by that?
you seem to appreciate the local scenery.
I am fine.
ok...
you know, i was thinking... all that stuff father seamus said...about discord, distrust... we are doing all right, are not we?  you do not have any doubts about me, do you?
should i...
no.  you two are the most important things in my life.  i do not ever want to lose you.
good night angel...
good night daddy.
where are we going to go, mommy?
we are going to go someplace new.
what about all my other stuff?
we will get it later.
h-how long will it take?
go to your room!  now!
you do not think i know?
know what?
do you think I am a fool?
what?
nothing's changed, has it. you still want to deceive me?
what are you talking about?
maura, what is this!
we are not going.
not going!  are you out of your mind?!  wait!
your father does not love us anymore!
what do you mean?  mommy? you are scaring me!
we will destroy you...destroy all of you!
no...  no!
mommy!
aubrey run! aubrey stares in horror at maura - just then the knife fades away as maura rolls over, returned to normal -
maura!
what is happening!
oh my god, what happened to you? my baby -
I am ok mommy.
are you all right?
I am ok.
you are bleeding.
I am all right...
