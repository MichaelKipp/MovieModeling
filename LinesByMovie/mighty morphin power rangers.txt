the stealth eagle is about to fly.
ditto for the swooping swallow.
be the eagle.  be the eagle.
be the swallow.  be the swallow...
i heard that!
i'll be at the observatory sunday.
the earth was hurtling toward us at seven hundred miles per hour, and we knew at that moment that we were facing death straight in the eye.
we could smell it's breath.
in a place that came to be known as angel grove.
the chamber has been accidently uncovered!  you must return it to the depths. or  anyone should open it and ivan is released!
to assist you i have retro-fitted your helmets with new opti-scan devices.
use extreme caution, rangers. you are dealing with an evil here that is beyond all comprehension.
don't you ever have anything nice to say?!
well, if i did i certainly wouldn't say it to you!
anybody see anything?
... let's take a look over there.
alpha, my sensors tell me the rangers were too late!  ivan is on his way here!
hey, nobody enters the command center without a power coin!
pterodactyl!
triceratops!
saber tooth tiger!
white tiger!
let's teach these vermin a few manners.
activating power beam!
anybody see them?
activating power scope!
... what's happening to him?'
outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate!
alpha.  is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  any way at all?
... perhaps there is a way... i have heard tales of another power.
it's far too dangerous.  zordon would never allow it.
if we don't try, zordon won't survive!
ay, yi, yi, yi.  the legend speaks of a master warrior who lives on the planet phaedos... this is the only person who knows the secrets of the power.
how can we reach phaedos?
rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!!
how dare you?!  nobody shuts up rita but me!
we never liked the cheesedongs in the first place.
couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  and did you catch a whiff of their breath?!  it's like having a conversation with a couple of onions!  not to mention...
mordant, go with them and report back to me!
you know boss, i'd really like to help out but i've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave--
isn't this just typical!  we finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens!
from now on it's e-v-i-l, no exceptions!
you okay?
i think so.
taking over the world is one thing.  it's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
you want me to place a few calls?
no offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.
yes, well, i suppose you'd know a little something about that.  not to worry.  i'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  and what better way to entice them ... than with a little ivan's ooze?!
but boss, what about their parents?
ah, the old and doddering.  i'm going to scourge their puny minds, reducing them to zombie's. and then i'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
bulk... why don't we give mr. peep here a chance to think it over?
a stellar idea, skull.
here you go!  no pushing!
there's enough for everybody!
uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information.
if we told you -- we'd have to kill you.
is this... food!
they're called squirbs.
... not bad.
listen, we appreciate your hospitality, but we really don't have much time.
it is said that to those who possess the power... all things are possible.
where did it originate?
in another time, another dimension.  it was brought here long ago by the "nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct. they built an impenetrable stone monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies.  for thousands of years, beings from all over the universe have tried to obtain it... all have perished.
so how can we get to it?
the only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...
and how do we do that?
by learning the ancient art of ninjetti.  it is the genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the ninja.  it is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.
he wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.
ah... sure.
in the language of the nathadians, "nin" stands for "man", "jetti" stands for "animal".  ninjetti  - man and animal, together as one.  now, put your hands inside the flame.
yeah, right.
it will not harm you.
wow.  sand.
now tell me... what do you see?
aisha, you are the bear, stalwart and bold.
stylin'!
i see... a fox
close.  billy, you are the wolf, cunning and swift.
it's... an eagle?
look closer.
... a falcon?
tommy, you are the falcon, winged lord of the sky.
... alpha, i am deeply concerned about the rangers...
i told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen.
... we must try to communicate with them.
i can hardly walk...
i've never been this sore in my life.
simon says...
quack like a'duck!
hey, boss!
what kind of landing was that?! these clowns are a menace to the sky
that's right.  and then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!
so they've been destroyed?
"basically".
what do you mean "basically"?
well... we were about to finish them off... when this huge monster came out of nowhere!
did these sticks make a whistling sound?
how'd you know?
dulcea!  that miserable, manipulating loathsome she-devil of a witch!!
how the heck?!...
what's going on?!
as soon as we've taken over the world i'm gonna change my name to sir mordant.  or how about major mordant?!
how about major moron?
what is that!
feast your eyes upon the exoskeleton of the barbaric hornitor!  keep digging.  the dreadful scorpitron should be close by.  once i have my ecto-morphicon machines up and running, i shall annihilate angel grove... and then... the world
just shut your gap!
did i say anything?
by bouncing ultra-high frequencies off one of the network satellites, i can send a long-range pulsar signal to within two feet of the rangers coordinates.
... i just pray we're not too late.
it is said that once you've reached the power... you have only ten triacs to release it.
what's a triac?
about twenty seconds in your time.
and how do we release the power?
the legend goes that you release the power with the power.
that's pretty bad.
thank you, dulcea.  for everything.
what!
you forgot to say 'simon says."
that's the only way to the monolith...
we can take these guys!
the boys are back in town!!!
go ivan!!
we've come all this way for a rock wall?!
there should be a way to open it.
... nothing.
release the power with the power.
six become one... the combined forces of the ninjetti.
strength in numbers!!
i am the wolf, cunning and swift!
i am the crane, agile and sublime!
i am the mighty ape!
and i am the falcon, winged lord of the sky!
of course!  the power is of another world.  another dimension.
we've got ten triacs before we're toast!!
release the power with the power.
what does that mean?!
release the power with the power.
i've got it!  we use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!!
three seconds!!
let's do it!?
new power coins!!
our morphers are on line!
there goes the neighborhood.
a real shame.
rangers...  i'm afraid you're too late.
what?!
zordon...  he's gone.
ninja crane zord!
ninja wolf zord!
ninja ape zord!
ninja falcon zord!
all systems go!
this guy is messing with the wrong teenagers!
i'm outta here.
wait for me!
get off me!
but i'm your cousin!
second cousin, three times removed.  now  get off me!
system malfunction!
our semi-conductors are down!
let's go after him!!
ultra ninja megazord complete!
i'm in!
let's fly!
we've got him locked!
speed?
1600 m.p.h.  and increasing!
everybody hold on tight.  we're gonna send this sucker into oblivion!
he's on us!!
wait a second...  what time is it?
two thirty three a.m.
ryan's comet!!
it's passing over earth as we speak!  trajectory coordinates are 009843.
billy, that's brilliant!
we get ivan into the comets path--
skull!!
bulk!!
i hope those rangers put that lousy lowlife out of his misery!
go power rangers!
three degrees off the comets trajectory!
give it everything we've got!
ay, yi, yi!  the rangers are going to be crushed!
don't lose hope yet, alpha!
009843... 42... 41!  we're in alignment!
there's the comet!
impact in fifteen seconds!
we have to get out of here!!
we can't break free!
impact in eight seconds!
four seconds to impact!
we're outta here!
that was a cheap shot!
we couldn't have done it better ourselves.
