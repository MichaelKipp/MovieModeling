name?
gus gorman.
ah yes, august gorman. have you looked for work this week, mr. gorman?
yeah.
what kind?
kitchen. . . technician
dishwasher? any luck?
nope, but --
mr. gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
thirty-five.
not counting this week.  you secured employment last june as a messenger and were discharged after one day for. . .
they said i lost it on the subway, but it am not the truth! it was a pickpocket took it!
a television set?
well, it was one of them little bitty two-inch screen japanese jobs.
the only other employment you found was in a fast-food joint--  -- which lasted. . . 28 minutes! well! that is some kind of record. talk about fast!
man, them people was crazy! how they 'spect you to learn all that jive on the first day? "hold the pickle! hold the lettuce! extra onions! special sauce! no special sauce!" am not nobody found no meat inside that glop yet.
mr. gorman, the city of metropolis is generous to a fault, but. . .
i know, I am the fault.
thirty-six weeks of chronic unemployment, thirty-six weeks of living off the taxes of hard-working citizens. do you know what you are?
do not call me a bum! i am not no bum!
you are, i was about to say, no longer eligible.
what about this week's check?

who is she?
her name's lorelei ambrosia. she is webster's girl friday.
who is the other woman?
that is his sister. vera webster.
the picture looks blurry.
the picture's fine. that is the way she looks in real life.
you are amazing, olsen. a boring banquet and you bring back 3,000 boring pictures. then superman puts out a fire on third avenue this morning and you stand there and watch the whole thing and you do not take one picture!!
i did not have my camera with me.
a photographer eats with his camera, a photographer sleeps with his camera --
mr. white, please, it is time for you to draw this month's winning jingo number.  the prize is an all-expenses trip to south america.
why can not the idiot in circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
because you are the editor-in-chief. your integrity is unquestioned. lois i have a question.
hi, lois. morning, jimmy, you have got mustard on your lapel. excuse me, mr. white, i do not mean to interrupt but ---
please, kent, not now. I am trying to put out a newspaper here.
53.
53!
okay? goodbye.
you have got to pick three more numbers.
mr. white, please, i promised those people I would get back to them by this morning. what do you think?
look, i do not know, kent. . . clark  personally, i think it could be a terrific story!
what terrific story?
kent's been invited to his high-school class reunion.
whoopee.
it is practically an american ritual, mr. white! is not that so, jimmy?
i would not know mr. kent. most of the people i went to high school with are still in high school.
anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. what it is really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: can you go home again ?
say!
take me, for instance. going back to middle america after having become a metropolis sophisticate --
I am getting a cramp in my elbow from this.
let me do it for you, mr. white.
so, mr. white? can i go ahead and make my travel arrangements?
exactly what i was about to ask about me.
all right, kent. i just hope you know what you are doing. if you really think smallville is your big chance, go for it.
what about me?
what about you?
a story like this cries out for great human interest pictures.  the big dance! the homecoming game! mr. kent posing next to his old locker!
hey, I would definitely shoot color on that one, jimmy. it would be a crime to just use black and white.
okay, kent, call your people and tell them the prodigal son is coming home. favoring clark -- happy now, he turns to leave the office. shot loses perry but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
-- but you  deserve the vacation, lois.
oh. you are going away.
mr. white, the next number, please?
how'm i supposed to turn this thing?
by hand. like the pioneers did.
could not we just get a computer to do this?
sonofagun! look at this here!
first paycheck?
first rip-off, man! supposed to be 225 bucks a week! you know what this sucker says?? $143.80!  federal tax! state tax! social security tax!
that is so you are still getting some money when you hit 65.
i am not going to live that long on $143.80! i want it now, man, while I am still young and cool.
actually, it is probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  there is always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
what'm i going to do with half a cent? buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  everybody loses them fractions?
they do not actually lose 'em. you can not lose what you never got.
who gets it, the company?
no, not really. they can not be bothered collecting half a cent from your paycheck anymore than you could.
so where is all them half-centses?
they are just . . . floating around out there. the computer knows where.
how many sugars?
one.  and a half.
quittin' time, gus. comin'?
uh . . . no, man. i got some work to finish up here.
workin' overtime? what are you doin', buddy, looking for a raise?
yeah. a raise . .
but my uncle al, on my father's side, he will not eat her stuffing, he says it should be cooked on the outside of the turkey and she puts the stuffing inside the turkey. so my mother told my aunt ellen . . . aunt ellen's my father's half-sister, i told you that, right?
mmmmm . . .
the thing is though, my cousin arnold, aunt rosey's arnold this is, he got mad when uncle al insulted his mother's stuffing, so now the problem is --
what is that?
wow, what a beautiful sunrise!
at one of the clock in the morning?
keep talking to that state trooper so he does not notice where I am going, okay?
what are you doing?
you know what mr. white said. a photographer always goes after a story.
lana lang. how great to see you.
clark.
you look wonderful.
you always did.  can i give you a hand with that?
you should not say that, you are the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
and here i am, just standing here. that is terrible. thank you.
you are welcome...??
for reminding me, i mean. can you follow me?
here i am, honey, and I am all yours.  remember when you were queen of the prom? all the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  but now there is only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it is --
brad wilson.
hiya, kent, long time no see. not that you ever could.  "see" i mean,  hahaha!
i can not  clark already asked me.  did not you?  he used to love this song.  did not you?  so he just said --  "would you dance with me?"
sure, lana, I would love to.
you would be surprised how many offers i did not get. even brad would not stick around for this.  it really is not easy.
the streamers? they are no problem, you just pull on them and --
and three years after the royal wedding, the king abdicated.  is not that terrible?
it sure is.
there must be a gallon of potato salad left over.
you know what is the problem?
too much mayonnaise?
mayonnaise? donald loved mayonnaise. why would you think that was the problem.?
i did not --
no, the problem is --  why do i stay in smallville? believe me, I have asked myself the same question. do you know how lucky you are to live in metropolis?  the big apricot.
but lana, you could --
that is easy to say. but how? and what about ricky?
who?
ricky. my little boy. at least here we have got a house. and I have got a job. okay, I am only a secretary, oaky, but it pays the bills. except for last winter when the fuel bills kept going up and up and up.  i even had to pawn my diamond ring then.
you...um...you never got married?
oh...i came close once.
that song. i remember one day i came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. and i thought -- what am i going to do with all this potato salad?
you thought that?
i thought "clark kent has a really nice voice." you did not even know i was there.
85,000 dollars.
missing????
embezzled, mr. webster.  stolen from the firm.
that is what i want to know! by whom? whom????
get a hold of yourself, vera.  nobody else ever will.
i do not know who. whom. i can not trace it.  in the old days it was simple. we kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. if somebody wanted to rob you, he would come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
my friend, you are yesterday. whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
ross, honey, it is time for your massage...
bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
now, vera...uh, simpson, you know my staff dietician?
hello.
if you do not mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
why do not you hold your breath, instead? maybe you will turn blue. on you that would be an improvement.
i do not kiss.
oh, right. well then, just shake hands.
well, chum? what now? kiss the 85 thou goodbye? pay some thief's salary while he thinks up new ways to shake the money tree?
he is bound to slip up sooner or later.
i just can not stand this.
hey, he will be all right. believe me lana, i know. i was a late bloomer myself.
it is not only that he is small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  look at him, he is stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
but all he had was chocolate milk.
i mean him.
hiya, sweet thing.  little guy's getting' hassled, huh?  kent, you still here?
i seem to be.
all the kid needs is a couple of pointers from the old champ here.  kent, i bet you did not know i won the all-country bowling trophy two years in a row.
uh, no, i did not know that, brad.
a natural athlete can play any sport. any sport.
say, brad. i think he will be better off doing it his way.
for a guy who was lucky to be water-boy on the high school team, you sure got a big mouth, kent.
i just think ricky would rather not get a bowling lesson in front of the other kids.
the kid needs a man to show him --
the kid will do fine on his own.  give it your best shot, ricky!
gus?
say what?
the boss wants to see you.
say who?
please, mr. webster, you are a great humanitarian. am not you heard what it is like in them jails? you send an innocent boy in and he gets thrown in with killers and robbers and rapers and raper killer and robber rapers and...
mr. gorman, just answer me one question...
you have been a naughty boy have not you?  c'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
uh...yeah. i did not think of it that way exactly, but...
say, fella, i understand. i can -- what do the kids say these days -- "dig where you are comin' from."  you want to be rich, right?
uh...
now me, i was born rich. I have never worn the same pair of socks twice.
yeah? what do you do with 'em?
i believe they are laundered and sent to some charitable institution. i do not know what the heck they do with 'em. maybe they use them for dust rags, or pen wipers...
or socks.
yes! that never occurred to me.  her ya go, buddy, single-malt.  gus, my friend, you are a genius. okay, a naughty genius, but hell, nobody's perfect.
'cause i know about getting' them half-centses?
gus, webco, the webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. a little magnesium here, a little zinc there. some railroads here, some farm machinery there. you follow?
I am tryin' to.
gus, do you know what i want now? i want coffee!
black or regular?
i do not think you understand.
man, what is this?
plants. plants always make an office cozier.
under different company names. i control the price of coffee beans in brazil. the price in venezuela. java, south korea, north korea, the aleutian islands, guam, bolivia, and the republic of gabon!
decaffeinated too?
but y'see, chum, the problem i got is that one country just will not play ball with me.  you know how that can just bug a guy, do not you?
which country?
columbia.
columbia.
columbia's got two major exports and one of them's coffee.
wipe 'em out?
destroy the entire colombian coffee crop down to the last bean.
but mr. webster...you're doin' okay with brazil and them other places. what is wrong with just one little old country doin' their own thing?
a very wise man once said...i think it was attila the hun... "it's not enough that i succeed. everyone else must fail."  and you are going to do it for me.
me? how?
hey listen, i did not know your mama was comin' by...
sister! I am his sister!
gus, tell me, have you ever heard of vulcan?
that what they call you?
vulcan is the weather satellite						our government put up in orbit to monitor the weather.
but if somebody re-programmed it, it could do much more.
it could make weather!
storms! floods!
blizzards! heat waves!
how do you do that?
like everything else in the 20th century, gus. you push buttons.
mr. white, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
why do i have to do this?
why do i have to do this?
you! you are lucky i did not fire you. i get a chance at exclusive on-the-spot pictures of the biggest forest fire in history and what does he come back with??? a broken leg and twelve melted rolls of film.
it was hot!
computers talk to other computers, right?
somehow your twisted little mind should be able to figure out how to tap into the main computer at the aerospace center and reach vulcan.
through the telephone line terminal, that am not nothin'.
oh bubba, think of the possibilities.
what she call you?
she is not his mama either.
gus gorman, this is my psychic nutritionist.
always making yourself beautiful for me, are not you?  so, gus, can you make vulcan do what i want it to? you did not answer me, pal.  did you hear about that prison riot last week? it seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
yeah, yeah, i can do it.
when?
first question got to be "where."
what?
not "what." do not need a genius to figure out "what." need a genius to figure out "where."  he says I am a genius, your don --  brother! bubba! your bubba!  see, if you all do not want them to trace it back, you got to punch this in from someplace nobody'd ever think off. some little rinky- dink operation with a little mickey- mouse computer. ross it is got to be someplace you can sneak into.
someplace where nobody knows him so they can not connect him with us.
well, webco has a hundred and twelve subsidiaries and every one of them is tied to our central computer system. how about...hmmmm, someplace small...
gee, i have not done this in years.
some people do not think it is healthy.
well, it is true you have to be careful things do not spoil, especially with mayonnaise or cream.
clark, i think you worry too much about mayonnaise.
me??
I am talking about salt.  oh, go ahead, pour it on, relax. that is what picnics are for.
well...  not quite like this.
mom and i do this all the time.
and even nicer when there is a man around, which is not all that often.
there is a lot of choices here.
no, all the good ones are married. that is why brad thinks he is god's gift to women. this woman anyway. he is single. he will not take no for an answer, but he is the only one who is asking. and he knows it.
i meant all the choices here. all this --  -- cole slaw, guacamole --  this is some picnic!
peanut butter and jelly.
no, thanks.
no, i mean ricky. he is not interested in any of this stuff.
well, this pate is rather...unusual.
pate? what pate?  i did not make any --  oh, no, clark. that is buster's dog food.
gee, i have not laughed like that since -- since --  i really can not remember when.
me neither...
so...how much longer do you think you will be in smallville --
you know, i was just thinking, lana --  -- someone like you could do do really well in metropolis --
i can never get a way from it.
old ties are hard to cut.
no. i mean, yes they are, but i was talking about that.  wheat king. bet your bottom dollar that is a wheat king thresher.
that is the biggest change in smallville, you know. they have taken over this town. everybody who is not actually working for wheat king -- like i do -- is out there --  on a wheat king thresher.  do you think i could do it? do you?
ride a thresher? well, i do not know. girls are trying just about everything now but --
no, what you said before, could i make it in metropolis? I have dreamed about it, sure, but i never really thought about it.  what would i do when i got there?
call me.
oh, i would not want to -- i mean, I would want to, but i would not want to...be a nuisance to you.
the dog's always doing that.  and the car's always doing that.
can i help?
ricky?  where...what...
I would wash that out with some iodine...  okay, mercurochrome.
thank ...you.
anytime.
oh. I am lana lang. this is ricky.
we have already met.
and this is...  ...clark.  my friend is around here somewhere, I will just look for...
I am sorry, I am in a real hurry.  see you around, pal.
mr. kent! superman was here!
what!
he really was!
uh-huh.
well, are not you excited?
lana, I am from metropolis. i see superman every day.
yeah? what do you want?
buddy, are we in trouble.
what?
first the supplier could not find the invoice. then the order came up short. then i missed the four of the clock plane from cleveland and had to rent a car, and then i got a darn flat tire on the highway! can you beat it? boy, your boss must have been furious when i did not show up by the end of the day today, huh?
what are you talkin' about?
good lord, fella! I am talking about your boss.
mr. roebush?
roebush! that is  the guy! buddy, he is going to nail our behinds to the wall! this is special order! he said he had to have it before...  omigod!! what is tomorrow?
tuesday.
tuesday! i got to get it all set up in his office tonight before all those big shots come here tomorrow for the meeting!!
s'not bad, s'very good, but... y'know what is wrong with this... singapore...thing?
sling. singapore sling. what is wrong?
not enough vodka in it.
there is no vodka in it.
aha! what did i tell ya!
what? what did you tell me?
got vodka in it now. got to give it a new name. hey, listen, you thought it up, we will name it after you. what is your name?
brad.
brad is not a good name for a cocktail.
hey! y'know what they used to call me in high school?
brad?
no, no, on the football field. they called me...  ...the smallville flash.
hey, man, that is a great name for a cocktail!
man, you do not never pass out, do ya?
nope.  never.
gee, i always loved porch swings.
me too. that is why i put this one up.
do you really know superman?
we get together sometimes.
mr. kent, could i ask you something?
sure.
could you get me superman's autograph?
why stop at coffee!  a cup of coffee gets the world off to work in the morning, but what keeps the world working?
diet soda?
energy! and when they say "energy" what do they mean? nuclear? too dangerous. solar?? too underdeveloped.
you mean...you mean...vera! vera! the magnitude of this!!!
today coffee----
tomorrow the oil!
small potatoes.
we already have a super-tanker.
chicken feed.  if gus gorman can push the right buttons ---
i could have it all! holy cats! all the oil! all the tankers! all the pumps! the gosh-darn world will be out to lunch! no heat, no gas--sis, this is some nifty idea!
hey, boss.
just the man i wanted to see!
turn on the t.v.
i did. is not it neat-o?
uh...what channel were you watching?
what are you talking about, fella?
he ruined it! that lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
do not cry, bubba.
nice try, butch,  but it would not be effective against superman.  you will see! now that he is pulled this stunt, he will stick his nose in my oil scheme and ruin that one, too! I have got to get rid of him! I have got to!
how? shoot him? you know about him and bullets. not to mention knives, tanks, bombs...
how would you know?
hey, i know a lot of things!
so i understand from the graffiti I have seen.
wait a minute! she is right! kryptonite. i remember reading about it in an interview with him.  nuts...
what is wrong?
i just remembered the rest. there is not any more. the only chunk that ever landed on earth disappeared a couple of years ago. it was in this story in the daily planet.
where did it come from?
the planet superman came from. krypton.
it ain't. it is nowhere. it blew up. that is how come they shipped the dude to earth when he was a baby.  well. i know some stuff too, y'all.
wait a second. astronomers know where the planet used to be, right? and you know what happens when a planet explodes? debris. pieces floating in space.
so?
so all we have got to do is pick up the garbage.  we just have to find our where in heaven krypton used to be. then good old gus here contacts the vulcan satellite--
just hold on a minute. i have been doin' some thinkin'
god, that is what i keep you for.
that is what i been thinkin' about. how you been keepin' me.  i am not getting' nothing outta this gig.
gus, if there is anything i hate, it is greed.
greed!  let me tell you something---
no, well in this case i think i can speak for him.  i mean, I am pretty close to him, you know.  superman will be there on wednesday.
well, he is going to get the best home-cooked meal he is had in... in a long time. you tell superman we think he is wonderful.
you know, i really was not expecting all this.
well...i guess they did get a little carried away.
he was asleep before his head hit the pillow.  well, this was only the biggest day of his life. i really do not know how to thank you.
you just did, with that great dinner.
there is no rush.
but the bridge...
hey, do not i always get there in time?  come on, relax.
it is hard to believe... a great looking girl like you all alone like this. as she glances up at him, she is first flustered, then flattered, then...finally...just realistic:
listen, are you sure you should not do something about the bridge?
the bridge...?  I would better get going!
"at a special session of the general assembly, 178 countries voted to censure superman. with only columbia abstaining." ross that fella's becoming a public menace.
and he use to be such a sweetie pie! what is wrong with him the last two weeks?
he sure was not actin' bad and nasty that day in smallville. man, he was so full of niceness i was startin' to feel funny about layin' that chunk of...
kryptonite!
huh?
do not you see? okay, so you did not kill him. nobody's perfect. but that stuff we ran up in the lab was not a complete failure after all.  right after gus gave it to him, superman started to turn into a selfish, ornery, malicious, conniving...
a normal person.
and now that superman's out of the nice guy business...
we can get to work on that oil!
every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
they am not got captains?
yes, but they do not really need them. it is just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney.
you will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the atlantic ocean.
and do what?
and do nothing. just sit there.
then how is all the people going to get their oil?
you catch on fast, old buddy.  tell him about the pumps. i know how you love the part about the pumps.
i know, by computers.
will you stop interrupting ?!  you will command the pumps to stop pumping.
and then shut down the pipe lines.
pumps stop pumping oil. pipe lines stop pipin' oil. tankers stop deliverin' oil. man, this is high stakes.
thanks, kiddo. now, listen, this part's important. i want you to program one special command into all these systems. tell them these orders are irreversible, so it will be impossible for anybody to switch them back. can you do that, pal?
lookit, you are getting' what you want all the time. it am not right that i do not get somethin'! i never get somethin'!
i knew it, i knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
the moon! listen, man, when i was a little bitty kid all my friends got them electric trains for christmas. my mama did not have barely enough to pay the electric bill, let alone buy me no train set.
now...when do i get a taste?
i should think a taste of freedom is enough, do not you? or would you prefer jail?
do not lay that jail number on me no more. you need me out here doin' stuff for you more'n sitten' in no jail doin' nothin' for nobody.  'sides, i be known' some heavy stuff about you now. you do not want em spillin' the coffee beans.
is this blackmail?
do not be getting' racist with me, man.
is this whitemail?
fair's fair.
what do you want?
a waste-basket? gus those are plans.  blueprints.
for what?
a computer.
we have already got some.
not like this one you ain't. nobody in the world got one like this 'cause it do not exist yet. we got to build it.
you designed it?
i invented it, man. in my head. it is a stone killer-diller get-down get-it-on and twice-on-sunday super mutha computer.
what will it do?
everything.
what will it get me?
anything.
tell me more...
that is it! the last tanker! they are all mine now! all...
not quite. what is that in the lower right hand corner?
i thought you would never get here.
hey, do not expect me to save you. because i do not do that anymore.
do not worry. I am long past saving.
well, do not let me keep you from anything.
I am in no rush.  so what do you have in mind?
lots of things...
tell me.
I will do more than tell you. I will show you, back at my place. if you will just do me one little favor first.
okay, what is it? you want a ride?
never.  i get air-sick. you would not like that.
no, i do not think i would. so... then what can i do for you?
it is not much, really, you see, there is this little boat. well, not so little, really. and it is not going where it is supposed to go and...
yeah? how is it look?
it looks wonderful. it is wonderful, let's face it.
i told you it was not no jive.
gus, it seems we are talking state-of-the-art technology here. we are talking unlimited power. we are talking "get-down hot-cha daddy-o" whatever you called it.
stone mutha.
exactly. stoned mother.
but a machine this powerful is going to make powerful enemies. people who will want to destroy it.
am not nobody going to mess with my machine! i'll...i'll... what will i do?  I will build in a counter-punch! anything attacks it gets counter- attacked! and wiped out!
can you do that?
yeah, sure.  am not nobody going to stomp my electric train...
remember, gus. a machine does not want anything except to keep on being a machine. you have got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  you bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
you want to mess with superman?
can not wait, pal, can not wait.
i can not see anything.
turn on the light.
where is the light switch?
where do you usually find a light switch?
come on, let's give it a dry run.
wait for gus to get here, sis.
who needs gus?
he is the only one who can operate this --
like fish he is.  i know enough about computers to put a phd to shame.  come now, brother dear, you did not think i was going to let that little man run the show, did you? gus gorman telling us what to do -- I would sooner kiss a pig!
come on, will you?  we have got to get ready before he gets here.
gus?
superman. the boy you left behind.
you! activate circuits 29 through w7 and start full power coordinates on exterior defensive systems:
in other words, push this red button.
oh, superman!
cut the mush, lorelei. he is after our skin!
he can have mine. anytime.
awright. i got me my electric train, mama. i finally got --  hey, what you all doin' up there?!
join the party, genius! come on up!
i do not know you, lady.
but the other night...
that was not me. that guy's gone.  and you are next webster.
he is coming! he is going to hurt me!
do not bet on it!
yes! this time we got it right!
it is your genius, pal! you built a machine that can find anybody's weak spot, just like you said.
i can't! it is out of control!
but how? where is it getting the power from ???!
how you doing down there?
do not make me talk, please. i got enough problems just hangin' on.
hey, you are perfectly safe.
i am not about to argue with you.  what is going to happen to them three? ross the boss and those ladies?
that is up to the judge, gus. it is not your problem anymore.
watch out for them air pockets!
no, we are just going down.
we gonna crash?
i never crash, gus. that would be embarrassing.
we back in metropolis?
no...i just have a little stop to make.
whatcha wanna stop here for?  not that i am not glad to be on the ground, y'understand.
just a second.
thanks.  let's go
i was afraid you would say that.  hey, is there a bus station around here?
suit yourself, gus.  say, does your boss use a computer in this operation?
hi. mister kent.  guess who mom's having dinner with tonight? superman!
actually, that is why i stopped by. he is realy sorry, he wanted to make it, but then he...ran into a problem.
i guess he misses a lot of dinners.
but if you would not mind settling for me --
anyday...
lois, I have got to hand it to you. you are amazing. who else could manage to turn a three-week tropical vacation into a front page story that is going to blow the lid off government corruption in the caribbean?
i just knew i was onto something when that taxi driver kidnapped me.
you are the best, lois.
I would better be. suddenly I have got competition to keep up with.  your high school reunion article. i though it was terrific. and fascinating.  especially about the girl back home.  I will tell you what, clark, I will take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
gee, I am sorry, lois. but I have already got a lunch date. with mr. white's new secretary.
oh?
it is modern. it is up-to-date. it is state-of-the art.  people, i am in love with this machine.  go ahead, mr. white.
where is the handle?
there is no handle! you just push a button.
uh...excuse me, folks...
kent!
I am sorry, mr. white, but I have got an errand to run.
