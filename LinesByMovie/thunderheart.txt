hey.
hey. nice tie.
do not get too attached.
yeah.
you are my hero, carl.
heroes am not supposed to shake. I am shakin', man, look at me.
breathe, carl. four, nice, deep ones.
anyone stops us going in, we are with the bowen-hamilton textile company. we have rug samples.
rug samples.
we are one-dimensional, boring peddlers of fine carpet, carl.
jesus christ, larry, what the fu-- larry. that is not even your name, is it? what is your real name, you fucking scumbag?
do not have one, carl. i have a number, man. just like the numbers on those treasury checks. you stole from your own country, carl. shame on you.
ray...
mister tully.
do you want a coffee?
no. no, no. thank you.
levoi, cooch. raymond levoi, criminal division.
oh, yeah -- right.
south dakota...  did i do something unsatisfactory, sir?
no, ray. you are going to have to blame that on your grandmother.
interesting bloodline you have, ray.  french, scots-irish, italian, ...and one-eighth american indian.
sioux indian, right?
I am not that sure. yeah, i think --
-- yes, teton sioux. father's side.
ray, there is been a homicide out in an area known as the badlands. indian reservation.
it is not the first. there is been several. and our field office in rapid city is getting a lot of heat... none of the investigations have turned up jack shit.
the main problem is, ray, these people are extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-indians. relations have not been amicable.
different culture. hard to penetrate. the indians do not like white cops poking around. and that is why we are in a position where we have to bring in an american indian agent.
with an indian representative out there, we hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a cointelpro, selective operations unit, and it will be easier on agent couture if you can gain the people's trust and maybe --
woh, excuse me, sir... i see what you are saying... I have got a little indian blood, that is true. but --  i am not an... an indian. i can not just go in and --
-- your father was part sioux.
i did not know him, sir. he passed away when i was six.
seven.
those are two agents who went into a reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. they were executed at close range. that one there is a police officer killed by the mohawks up in canada more recently.
jesus...
the agents who have worked out here say its like going into nam. unfamiliar terrain, foreign language, foreign customs... and you never know when you might walk into a few rounds. they hold a lot of old anger for the white man out here.
were you in nam?
airborne. that is where they used to get us agents from. now we get 'em from carnegie-melon, ivy league. accountants and computer whiz-kids. yuppies with guns.  that is scary shit.
hey, hey, hey. j. edgar would have loved you. he would love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? "to enforce the laws of my country and protect her interests"?
you crashed my file?
no. i consulted it. we are going into indian country, i wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass. do not you?
six rounds. 357.
that is what it looks like, does not it? but that is what a ten gauge, choke-bored, shotgun will look like when it hits your lower back from five feet away.
somebody was serious about doing this guy, that is for sure.
ray.
taking old leo somewhere?
leo's been out here too long, man. I am taking him to ceremonial burial.
this is a restricted area.
check him out, ray.
nice piece. you come back here to cover your tracks, geronimo? what is your name?
it am not geronimo.
who are you?
i think maybe you guys got off the wrong exit, yeah? this is the bear creek indian reservation.
i know where i am. I am on federal land, doing a federal investigation, and if you do not wanna cooperate you can take a ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room, answering federal questions. it is your call. who are you?
I am a full blood oglala sioux, born and raised on this reservation.
you are a wise-ass. ray check his wallet.
i did.
who the fuck is he?
-- a fucking cop.
we got the wire ya was comin'. you are the indian official, yeah?
no. no, that is ray, here. ray, uh...  ray... little weasel.
leo's got to get to burial, brother. he is got to make the journey.
what journey?
tell him, ray.
leo has to take the journey, cooch.
we will have to give leo a refund. because he is got to go to the m.e. in case you do not know, officer, violation of the major crimes act on --
-- an indian reservation is within the jurisdiction of the federal bureau of intimidation. i know that.
good. thank you.
i said when can leo be taken to ceremony?
after we have completed our investigation.
somebody must be doing something somewhere in your jurisdiction, officer crow foot.
you am not going to cut his hands off and send 'em to washinton, are ya? they done that to one of our girls once. leo did quillwork, he is going to need his hands.
leo's going to need his hands, cooch. he does quillwork.
i think leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
respect the dead, hoss. because when --
-- did you understand me when i said that --
-- violation of the major crimes act on an indian reservation is within the jurisdiction of the federal bureau of instigation. i know that.
goodbye.
what the hell you doing?!
his mother needs a piece of his hair. it is for the keeping of the souls ceremony.  has to be kept for four days.
keeping of the souls. do they still burn their dead or something?
beats the hell outta me.
no. that is ray here. ray...
ray levoi, sir. pleasure.
i thought we were staying on the reservation.
yes. rooms thirteen and fourteen are on indian land.
i see.
are you hungry? i have some nice raw kidney in the truck.
oh, I am set, sir. I am set.
now keep that between us, dennis, cuz i do not know what kinda johnny law they got here.
hey, brooks, come over here. i want you to meet a coupla fellas from denver.
brooks, what is a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? let me buy you a glass of some of that russian shit you like.
fbi? what you investigatin'?
a murder. on the reservation.
again. figures, man.
you know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your puerto ricans? well out here we got indians. that is just the way it is.
the only good indian is a dead indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
water. worth killing for out here, I would think.
get the plate numbers off everyone of these cars.
i already did.
could not sleep.
good.
what are you --
watch out!
what?!
you are steppin' on sign.
hey.  hey, you, listen up --
-- leo was not killed here. he was dumped here. out of a vehicle. bald tread. muffler held on with baling wire.
big sonuvabuck. based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I would say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
bullshit.
-- well, maybe two-seventeen.
you are trying to tell me you can read all that from a track?
no. not just a track. you got to listen to the trees, man. to the leaves. to this sand, you fbi's kicked all up. you got to listen to the earth.
is that right? well, listen to this: drag your ass. this is a restricted area.
no, this is the home of the oglala sioux and i want the dog-fucker who killed leo. whether you get him or i get him, i just want him. shit's been goin' on too long.
you have got no jurisdiction.
you got no know-how. about indian way. or about jack shit for that matter.
maybe you are not aware of this, crow horse, but i just flew in from a place called the twentieth century where we have such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, dna fingerprinting; i do not have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk to the fucking trees to get answers. leo was killed right here.
go back to the m.e., take a look inside leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. trust me, there am not chickens in the badlands. his mother's place is --
-- his mother never lived here. she was from up in north dakota.
I am talkin' his spiritual mother. maisy blue legs.
his spiritual mother...
to us indians, our spiritual relatives are as close as family. I have got seven mothers on this reservation. sisters. brothers. you am not one of them.
thank god. now listen to me, asshole. I am giving you a break. but if my partner finds out you are here, you are going to be reading rat tracks in sioux falls maximum security.
easy. easy... I am goin'.
x21, give me a 20.
black tail district, x22. you ready for this? leo was not killed in the badlands. i... i found the location.
maisy blue legs place?
how did you know?
i got one up on ya.
go ahead.
I have got the doer. i know who he is.
meet me at base. over.
cooch. you are my hero.
who is he?
one of the leaders of the warriors of all red nations. militant organization.
white eagle feather through the circle. that is their symbol.
that is right.
they obviously wanted it to be known that they offed leo. some kind of statement.
jimmy looks twice put leo's head through a glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. and threatened him several times since. president clear moon and the regional fbi feel he made good on that threat.
I would just like five minutes alone with the motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.
easy, cowboy. no vendettas on my ship. now: remember what i told you about nam? watch the grass, watch the trees, watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, do not hesitate to empty that sucker.
alright. alright.
what are you doing?
james looks twice?
that is right. what are you doing here? this is a religious ceremony you are desecrating.
what is this about?
your good friend leo fast elk.
you think i killed him? cuz he was an apple? well, let me tell you something about leo, man --
-- do not "man" me, jimmy. where is the key?
you are an easy man to track, ray. ya walk like a penguin with a hard-on.
is that right? what are the trees saying today?
they are sayin' that nobody's going to talk to you cuz they do not give away one of their own. but they did say there is somebody way across the little walking river who wants to talk to you.
he sent me to find ya. he says he is got information.
let's go.
grandpa samuel reaches. heavy duty medicine.
medicine. as in medicine man?
why does he wanna see me?
good question. hardly sees anybody anymore. has not left this place in twenty years. did you bring some tobacco?
what did he say?
he wants to know if you ever watch the cookie monster. he says the cookie monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
but he is not unhappy with you because he knows you.
he knows me?
he says he saw you in a vision some time ago.
what is he smoke in that?
sacred herbs. tobacco. do not worry, we do not smoke no mexican agriculture in the pipe. that is a white man's myth. this is a sacrament.
what did he say?
he said he does not know.
he just did the gettysburg address in sioux. what did he say?
what was he saying?
why should i tell you.
because he was talking to me.
the old man saw an owl. over there in the dry wash. last week.
and...
he saw an owl.
so what?
the owl is a messenger. when one shows itself to a sioux... it means someone is going to die. the owl told him about leo.
the owl told him about leo. that is incredible. i guess we just broke the back of this investigation, did not we? evidence does not get any harder than that -- not for my money. is there anyway we can seduce this owl into federal court?
he also said "listen to the water."
listen to the water. listen to the owl. he also said, do not trust the fucking cookie monster.
go back to your dna finger-printin'.
mr. clear moon.
our police are afraid of them. please get them out of here.
they are going to kill me next. that is what i hear. these new indians are destroying everything. our people are a quiet people.
they can lead us to jimmy. just let them go. we are tightening the net on him. we know he is on the reservation.
x22. read.
go ahead, ray.
i have a pick-up truck. no plates. subject -- indian -- entering suspect's house. over.
okay, ray. I am coming in. if he starts to leave the area, move in. and hold him. over.
you are the indian fbi.
that is right. turn around.
this jimmy's?
you are not going to catch him. he can shape-shift into different animals. bear. elk. porcupine.
is that like an hereditary thing, magdelana, or can one take classes?
jimmy did not kill leo. why do you wanna do this?
he tried to kill him twice before. that is a good place to start do not ya think? leo was on the other side, was not he?
-- leo was an apple, that is right. red on the outside, white on the inside. and jimmy hated him. kicked his ass a coupla times. but he did not kill him.
who did?
you are the fbi. that is your job, is not it? ya know how many of our warrior brothers got killed out here? i never saw any investigating then. why now? what is going down here?
a fugitive alert for a murder suspect. before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.
try the fort laramie treaty. all over again.
look. you and i can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what is right and what is wrong. you are from the reservation. it is a different world.
I am from minneapolis. fifth street. i did four years at dartmouth before i ever set foot on this res. so i know about the other world, ray.
thank you.
when you see jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. okay?
grandpa reaches says you come from heavy indian blood. i used to think grandpa was gettin' senile. now i know he is.
move it, magdelana.
what did she say?
she talks a lot of shit. we are not doing our job. jimmy's innocent. "what's the fbi really doing here." some shit about the fort laramie treaty.
she took something from the house. what she called a medicine bundle. most likely jimmy's.
let's see it.
i gave it back to her.
that is good goddamn work, ray. let the salmon run. let 'em run upriver.
why we setting eagle bear up as an informant?
her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within. the warriors do not know who to trust, they start infighting, and jimmy loses his support.
her oil pan is shot.
cooch. what is the fort laramie treaty?
jesus, i do not know. you tell me. you are the indian.
cooch.  where the fuck did they send us?
a long way from home. you be careful out there.
do not be mad. that was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.
i see. forgive my cultural ignorance.
jimmy did not do it, ray. i checked it out. you can stop taggin' my sister.
she is your sister?
so did this one. wambli is a rare and sacred creature. when someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around the res. we share everything. a lot of power in the eagle feathers. but you think that is bullshit too, do not --
-- leo fast elk was sitting in the outhouse at maisy blue legs when a car pulled into the yard. he came out, approached the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was jimmy. he tried to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. he started running for the open grass. with the car moving, jimmy hung his shotgun out the window, took aim -- missed once, hitting the shitter -- fired again, and severed leo's spine. leo fell, rolled, and came to a stop in the grass. and some chicken feed. stale chicken feed with four days mold.  electromagnetic printing.
was-te. 'cept for one thing. jimmy looks twice was nowhere near there. ya see, when jimmy was twelve years old, his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near elk mountain.
i do not see the connection.
the connection is, it did a head number on him. he is petrified of cars. will not drive. I have known him all my life, and he is never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle. he rides passenger and he rides horses, and that is it. the man that shot leo down was behind the wheel of a moving car.
that is not solid.
you want solid? that one, single, print he left in the badlands -- the one the fbi missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. like a white man. jimmy has a serious ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. the man who murdered leo walked like a wasi'cu.
the old man? he is going to tell you who killed leo?
go catch jimmy, ray. really. he is gettin' away. go ahead, go get him. I am late.
hey. hey, those are my sunglasses you are wearing.
grandpa traded with me.  goodbye.
i can not do that,  it is a rolex.
a what?
red deer table, ray.
do not tell me: heavy duty.
heavy, heavy duty. taku wakan. wanagi spirits. it is one of those few places we would never go to as kids. still don't. some of the old people say crazy horse is buried back there. we have to go ray. together. like his vision.
walter. when i fill out my 302, do i say that evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?
ray --
-- no. no offense to the old man. i appreciate you trying to help. but i put my ass on the line coming out here, man.
what did you expect to hear?
not native american myths and legends. I am with the fbi, walter, remember? not national geographic.
what you call myths, we call our history.
it is not real.
what is real to you? wall street? capital hill? now they are myths.
i can not be dicking around here. that is all I am saying. i do not carry crystals, i do not wanna come back in another life. i just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
you am not no indian. you are a sal mineo indian.
take care of yourself, walter.
likewise.
the right man? talk to me, ray.
whoever dusted leo, dusted him from the driver's seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the badlands. jimmy looks twice has never been behind the wheel of a car. it is a known fact out here that he is petrified of driving. his parents were killed in a car wreck.
genetic ditto on evidence found at the site with evidence you found in his belongings. an incontrovertible motive. and definite footprints on jimmy looks twice at maisy blue legs house.
when did we get that?
today. and now you -- there is a dog in the van --
-- i know. i fed it, and i can not get rid of --
you were not sent here to go off on your own detail, ray. you were sent here to assist in a selective operations unit. these regional agents are inept -- that is why they were sent out here to the graveyard, to indian country. i need you behind me, ray. not pulling against me.
I am not trying to pull against you, cooch. I have just been having nightmares about the way leo was killed.
your first homicide, that is going to happen, ray...
i just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
ray. i never get into bed with somebody unless i know for sure. just the way i was raised.
alright. alright...
yeah, alright, alright -- fuck you -- give a yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. go get a tail on eagle bear, and stay with her. cuz jimmy's going to show. and i want you to make the collar.
I will sleep around a little.
thanks, cooch.
and get rid of the dog.
bastards...
all i could think of was... not here. i do not wanna eat it on an indian reservation, three thousand miles from home.
he is out there. he is out there playing sitting bull with us. i want the motherfucker so bad I am getting a bleeding ulcer.
it may have been maggie's way of saying "get off my ass."
she is that subtle?
eagle's claws and a bear's balls that is what her profile says.
well, she is running now, too. these fucking people like to run, do not --
-- cooch. woh. stop.
tread matches. it is the car.
yes.
and it was full of water when i drove by here three days ago. full. i mean... a river.
the little walking river. you are right. this is part of it. so whoever sunk this car did not compensate for drought. goddamn.
agent little weasel, federal bura of your imagination.
jesus christ. you are hammered. what are you doing?
you are right about the old man. his power's long dried up. he is supposed to be a medicine man but he will not go see the people. he says we changed, and we do not listen. well, he do not go out and talk no more. i have not had a drink in three years but i just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this hoss is gettin' watered.
cut the shit. you should not be in here, man.
cuz I am a skin?
cuz you are a cop.
not no more.
what are you talking about?
you tell me. you tell me who went to the b.i.a. -- bureau of indian annihilation and said i was messin' with your case, man. i do not give a goddamn about your case.
and i do not give a goddamn about whether you wear a badge or not, crow horse, but i did not cut you.
still after jimmy?
they found prints at blue legs' place.
yeah. jimmy's prints are there. but they cross over benjamin black star's prints. and he was not there until six of the clock the mornin' after to get eggs from the chickens. so jimmy was not there til the next day. follow?
next time I will be ready. you get the word to who ever it is.
i can't, hoss. i do not talk to fbi's.
you think you was sent here cuz you are a good cop?
no. i was sent here cuz I am indian. and a good cop.
no plates. no registration. serial numbers removed. and all prints washed off by the river. that is great. this is turning out to be a walk in the park, do you know that?
come back?
never mind.
ray. x22.
i read, cooch.
remember that upside down flag back at jimmy's house? somebody took it down.
good.
they took it down, set fire to it, and threw it on the doorstep of room 13 at the buffalo butte motel. your room.
you burned an american flag today. and left it for me...
-- you desecrated it, it had to be burned.
i desecrated it?
you forced an innocent man to run like an animal. you have tried to poison my people's hearts against me with your manipulation, with letters i never wrote... you have been watching me eat, work, raise my family... wash myself in the river. and now you are here, arresting me at a sacred place.  in your eyes, that is power.
your relatives must have taught you something.
no.  my father never told anybody he had indian blood. but he still used a few indian words around the house. he called me washee. said it meant... good boy.
what?
wa-shee is like... a dumpling. like tallow we put in stew. i think he was calling you chubby boy.
great.
jesus, you alright?
yeah. i... i fell asleep. i can not believe it. i --
never turn your radio off! i thought i was gonna find you scalped! damn it!
sorry, cooch. i lost eagle bear --
-- never mind eagle bear. we have got jimmy nailed. let's go!
listen: when we get back tomorrow, you are going to find tully laying a promotion on you. s.a.c. he wants to prove that his yuppie agents are making good. he is offering you new york. tell him you want atlanta.
why?
cuz i want new york.
what ya want?
must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. how long you been in it?
since i got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
at sioux falls pen?
no, that was leavenworth. this --  was sioux falls. what ya want?
leavenworth a tough joint?
you ever try solitary confinement?
no. can not say that i have, richard. richard do you know why I am here?
washington sent ya. i know that.
yes, washington sent me, richard. they sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. do you know what i mean when i say this whole thing has been fucked, richard?
not for long, richard. you got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you did not deliver.
what the fuck you talkin' about?
get up out of the chair, richard.
what is with you people? why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? i came through, man.
get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, richard.
i get thrown in solitary until i do not know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me i can beat nine years if i help you. i helped you!
get up!
they said I would never see fbi again, and I am livin' with you fuckers. i do not feed ya information on the warriors, it is back to the pen. i do not do this, back to the pen. your word against my word. against a con indian's word. i really got a chance, man, right?
they sent me here, richard because they said you did not hold up your end of the arrangement, and i have to transport you back to leavenworth.
what the fuck, man? what do you people want? i did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.
leo fast elk... is alive.
no way. no fuckin' way.
how the hell do you know?
i blew his back out with a buffalo gun, that is how i know! now you are going to say i didn't, so you can throw me back in solitary?
the men who came to see you at leavenworth. the one's who made the arrangement... who were they? maybe i can talk to them.
miles. three other suits. that is all i know 'em as -- suits. were you there?
you turned leo over on his face. but the coyotes must have turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. it is out, and it knows.
what do you know about spirits? you am not no in'dn.
leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell jimmy. but you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. do you realize what leo could have told jimmy?! do you?!
i took him out before he got the chance. he did not say nothin' about tashka sha. and now his spirit is in the dirt. forever.
what is tashka sha, speak english, speak english!
red deer table! what is with you, man?
keep talking, yellow bird...
all i know... is i did what i did... and i am not in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. but i tell you what, suit. take me back. cuz i can not take this shit no more.
five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
crow horse, listen --
where is maggie? where did ya take her.
nowhere. I am trying to find her.
you got jimmy. let her go.
crow horse, listen. you have to come with me.
why? so you can get rid of me, too?
no. so we can do what the old man said. red deer table, walter. we have to go.
do they come in dreams, these visions?
oh yeah. dreams. sometimes durin' sickness. vision quest. sweat lodge. ya never know when.
just before we caught jimmy... i had a dream that i was being chased. and i was running with other people. old- fashion indian people. i got shot in the back. like leo.
where was this?
at wounded knee. i mean, that is where i was, and that is where the dream was. why?
you were running with the old ones. at the knee. heavy duty.
well, it was just a dream, i --
sonuvabuck! what is with you, man? who are you?
what do you mean?
nothin'. forget it.
you had a vision. you had yourself a vision. a man waits a long time for a vision. might go his whole lifetime and never get one. and along comes some instant indian with a mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
sorry.
I am a full-blood oglala.
we have driven a long way. where is this place?
maybe it was just a dream. ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
yeah. fitful dreams.
bullshit. you had a vision. you got sign from the old ones.
what the hell do you want me to do?!
stop.
what is that?
am not prayer flags, that is for sure.
jesus. oil?
uranium. test holes. somebody came in from the nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin'. they are gettin' ready to suck this baby dry.
1868...
what?
that is what we are doing here. national interest. national security. only this time it is not gold. it is uranium.
we are standin' on broken treaty ground, ray. this am not supposed to be here. it will poison the water.
leo knew about it. tried to tell jimmy, get the warriors involved.
so they took care of leo.
listen to the water... the river keeps goin' down then rising again.
this clear moon's house?
yeah. it is time to beat the drum. you better wait here. he do not trust the white man.
alright. shit's comin' down. he is callin' council fire. all the old chiefs and the warriors, too. i got to be at grandpa's place in two hours. we need to get the tribe together. we need to block this thing.
what we need... is richard yellow bird.
i thought it was a rare case of a brother getting a break in the courts. we did an honorin' song for him and everything.
he is looking at a few hundred years in leavenworth. he is not going to come out without a fight.
x21. come back.
ray. what is your 20?
what are you doing on the reservation?
I am on my way back in. over.
ray. ray, do not let go now, man. ray...
you go to the council fire. I am going back in.
ray.
you ever put your hands on me again and you will be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking everglades, mister.
you did not tell me about red deer table --
-- what the hell is red deer table?
what is it? it is genocide, that is what it is. it is a pay zone for some u.s. corporation and a dead zone for the people here. uranium, cooch.
this was a selective operations unit, agent levoi. there is classified information pertaining to our national security. you do not question that, you do not go digging into that shit -- that is insubordination. jesus christ --
-- if they mine uranium there, these people will have no place left to go...
we were sworn in on the constitution to protect federal matters, ray. i do not know about uranium, i do not know about red dog table -- all i know is we did our job. it is over.
we neutralized anybody with a voice. leo, jimmy... eagle bear. anyone who was standing in the way of the land. is that it?
