mm-hm?
have you tried these?  these are wonderful.  holly and her friend made them.
they are fantastic.
are not they great?
your sister is an unbelievable cook.
i know!  i know!
she has all the cooking talent.
no, she doesn't, either.  you have got tons as well.
ohhh, but I have eaten five of these.
what?  you are kidding!
no, no, we decided!
perfect!
mmm...i mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
great idea.
i know.
that is where your talent lies.
get outta here.  could i speak to you privately?
oh, sure.
hannah, i have to borrow some more money.  do not get upset.
mmm, i never get upset over that. mmm?
this is the last time, i promise. and I am keeping strict accounts.
holly, please.  do not insult me.
someday, I will pay it all back.
i know.  h-how much do you need?
two thousand dollars.
uh-huh.
hannah, i know it is a lot, but my friend april and i, we have this catering idea i think's going to be great.
you admit that we are great cooks, right?
yeah.
well, in order to get started, there is just a few things i have to buy...  and some old debts i have outstanding.
will you just tell me one thing?
okay.
are we talking about cocaine again?
i swear.  i swear.  we have already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.
aah... hey, have you tried holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
i think they are fantastic.
you have outdone yourself.
oh, my god.  thank you.
i need an antihistamine.  mom thinks she is feeling her asthma, and so...
ohh?
uh-oh.
yeah, mom's camille when she gets up in the morning.
at least she is not drinking.  did you notice?
mm-hm.
does not she look great in that new dress?
yeah.
do not you think she does?
she really does, though.
yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she is flirting with all the men here.
god.
maybe when she is eighty, she will stop straightening her garter belt when there is a guy around.
i should get a garter belt.
yeah.
get a garter belt...  get a garter belt and flirt.
where are the antihistamines?
oh, i don-- ask elliot for that. uh, he is got them somewhere.
okay.
frederick did not come with her.
when does frederick ever come with her?
tch.  he is such an angry...he's such a depressive.  i thought she was moving out!
watch out, you guys.  beep-beep!
oh, your kids are so adorable.
oh, hannah!
it's, uh, you never know--
he is such a loser!
he is not a loser at all!
oh, he is such a loser!
he is the headmaster of daisy's school.
oh, perfect!  he reminds me of ichabod crane.  his adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. hannah  listen.  he is a lot better than your ex-husband.  he is got a good job.  would you light those, please? he's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.
...any sister talk?
mm-mm!
oh, good...
come in, come in.
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
oh, listen...
i know.  it is terrible!
i mean, I have looked everywhere.
hm-mm.  oh, yeah.  i met phil.
mmm?
he is the--he looks like ichabod crane?
i love that.  that is my type.
i can not believe it!
no, really, i really like him a lot.
no, really, we must not get discouraged.
hannah will invite some men over who do not look like ichabod crane.
mmm.
not this thanksgiving, you know.
here.  be careful with those.
maybe at christmas, new year's.  if not this new year's, maybe next new year's.
ouch!
oh!
oh, you know, i, i love that book you lent me.  the easter parade? you were right.  it had very special meaning for me.
how is frederick?  he did not come.
oh, well, you know frederick.  one of his moods.  although it was not a bad week.  he  uh, sold a picture.
oh, great.
really?  so, so, what else?  wh- what are you up to?
oh, i do not know.  my unemployment checks are running out.  um, i was thinking of taking some courses at columbia with the last of my savings.
like, uh...?
i do not know exactly.
oh, great.
you look so beautiful.
come on.
does not she look pretty?
i bumped into your...
yeah.
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
oh, yeah?
he was, he is just as crazy as ever. he was on his way to get a blood test.
god, mickey's such a hypochondriac. i wonder how he would handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
let's go have dinner, shall we?
mmm.
dad...
oh...
dad!
...this is a toast!  this is a toast.
get his wine away.
this is a toast.  you know this beautiful thanksgiving dinner was all...
hey!
...from mavis, also.
you bet.
holly and april, thanks for helping.
i am... i did slave all day.
and we drink to her, and we all congratulate her on her wonderful accomplishment during this last year...her great success in a doll's house!
i do not know about that.  oh, no, i just, see, i-i've been very, very lucky.  w-when i had the kids, i decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I have been very, very happy  but...i've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
yeah.
...just for a second.  so, now i got that out of my system and i can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
want some coffee or tea?
no, thank you.
how about something to eat?
no, nothing.
are you sure?
absolutely.
mmm, what am i gonna do with you?
god!  and why did not you come tonight? we all had a terrific time.  i really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
I am going through a period of my life where i just can not be around people.  i did not want to wind up abusing anyone.
you are not going to abuse them. they are all so sweet.
lee...  you are the only person i can be with...who i really look forward to being with.
is not it enough that i can love you?
mmm...
hmm?
...you're such a puzzle.  so sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else.
well, there was a time  when you were very happy to be only with me.  you wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
mm-hm.
have i really taught you everything i have to give?  i do not think so.
mmm  you never know.  they might.  he is just trying to do the nice thing.
because he likes you.
me?
yeah.
elliot lusts after you.
based on what?  you never even see him.
...or films you must see or...
oh, no, no, no.  he is my sister's husband.  and i think if you gave him half a chance, you would like him. he is very intelligent.
you--  standards and practices?
ed smythe, yes.
okay.  why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty?
child molestation is a touchy subject...
could you--
...with the affiliates.
read the papers!  half the country's doing it!
yes, but you name names.
we nev-- we do not name names!  we say the pope.
we--
...cannot go on the air.
mickey, mickey, listen, listen.
you know...
in-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why do not we repeat the cardinal spellman ronald reagan homosexual dance number?
no--
look at this guy.
yeah?
oh, jesus!
ron...ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
hi!  hi!
i know...i know.
glad you could put in an appearance.
i got two minutes.
very good.
i got to see new comedians later, I have gotta--
two minutes on your sons' birthday. you know, it is not going to kill you.
yeah, are not you like, you know...
huh?
...a little, uh, hey!  a little hug! what is this?  now how 'bout a little action from the kids?
how is everything?
everything's good.  everything's fine.
yeah?  yeah?  okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
here, you guys.  open them up.
let me get a little reaction here.  how is elliot?
he is fine.
yeah?
oh, you know what?  I am trying to convince him to produce a play.
oh!
i think he will find that satisfying.
really?  that will be terrific for him, i think.
i think so.
i like him.  i think he is a sweet guy.
yeah.
the few times that I have met him...  is not that a great mitt?
ohh!
h-he's so awkward and he is clumsy like me...
i know, i know.
...so i, so i like that.  i always like an underconfident person...
that is really nice!
...you know?  i, uh...
you know, he is been wanting a mitt.
you have always had good taste in husbands, so...
thanks, thanks.
mh-hm.
that is a beauty!
is not that great?
oh!
go right over there.
football!
come on!  hurry up!  let's go!
wow!
go out, go out by the sung vase and, and catch this.
so what is the, uh, problem this time?
this time i really think i have something.
so, so, but it was when i was younger, so--
you know, i saw your father this week about his sinus...
mm-hm.
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  i mean, he's, you know, he's--
you mentioned on the phone that you would had some dizziness.
yes, a little dizziness, and i think, i think I am developing a hearing loss in my right ear  ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no.  no, I am sorry.  it was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.
now i ca-can't remember.
let's take a look.
well, I am sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear.
really?!
have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?
no, i-i've been perfectly healthy. you know me.
i always, i-i always imagine that i have things.
when did you first notice this?
oh, uh, about a month ago.  wha- what do i have?
you have had some dizzy spells.  what about ringing and buzzing? have you, uh, noticed any of that?
yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, i-i-i have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  ringing and buzzing. um, am i going deaf, or something?
and it is just in one ear?
yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
what I would like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I would like to have them run some tests.
the hospital?  what kind of tests?
now, do not get alarmed.  these are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than i can run here.  i mean, it's, it is nothing.
well, if it is nothing, then why do i have to go into the hospital at all?  i mean, uh, i hear perfectly fine, so i'm, so I am a little weak on the, on the high decibels.  so i, you know, i will not go to the opera.
you know, there is no reason for panic.  i just want to rule out some things.
like what?
it is nothing.  will you trust me?
n-n-no, not that.
hello?
like--
you do not have a brain tumor.  he did not say you had a brain tumor. mickey  no, naturally  they are not going to tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
but not you.
oh, god!  do you hear a buzzing?  is there a buzzing?
mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
i can not keep my mind on the show.
but there is nothing wrong with you.
if there is nothing wrong with me  then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
well, he has to rule out certain things.
like what?!  what?
i do not know.  cancer, i--
do not say that!  i do not want to hear that word!  do not mention that while I am in the building.
but you do not have any symptoms!
you--i got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
naturally, i, i--do you know i--the sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
it was on your shirt!
i--how was i to know?!  everyone was pointing back here.
eh, you were miserable this morning! we got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
no, i was happy, but i just did not realize i was happy.
we are a big hit.
oh, in this we are a big hit. yesterday i auditioned for come back little sheba.  that, i was not such a big hit.
excuse me, are there any more claims?
only a few.  a few.  do you like 'em?
i can not resist.
really?  how flattering!  did you try the shrimp puffs?
listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  something is wrong.
we are actresses.
is this your first job?
really?  is the food that bad?
oh no.  not at all.
we need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  hi.
i know.  you are an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
uh, no, the shrimp puffs are holly's.  i do the, uh, crpes caviar.
and the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
well, let's hope so.
here, i stole you a couple of extra clams.
ah! holly  now.
hi.
oh.
you are holly.
yeah, we are the stanislavski catering company.
now I am going to tell you the truth. i really came in here because i was bored stiff by the party.
what makes you think we are more interesting?
we saw, um, pavarotti, eh, uh, in ernani at the met, and i cried...
i cry at the opera.
oh, what, what do you do?
I am an architect.
wha--  what kind of things do you build?
are you really interested?
yeah.
yeah.
what time do you get off?
wow, it is the red one?
oh, it is magnificent!
yeah.
it is terrific!
the design's deliberately noncontextural.  but i wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
uh-huh.
and in the material. that's...that's unpolished red granite.
oh!
oh, is that what it is?
uh-- april  i-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
right.
it is almost...almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what i mean.  i-i... i can not put it into words.  the important thing is-is-is it-it breathes.
you know, april, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them.  i get the feeling you tune in to your environment.
oh--
what are your favorite buildings, david?
you want to see some?
oh, yeah.
well, let's do it.
great.
oh, it is just so romantic.  i just want to put on a long gown...
yes.
...and open the french doors and go on the balcony --
it is french, though.  it really is.
yeah.
it feels like you are in france.
and it is got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
yeah.
they fit right in together.  and your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then...
that is just --
look at this.
that is disgusting!
...a monstrosity!  who would do that?
it is really terrible.
it is really sad.
and it ruins everything else.
it does.
well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
yeah.
yeah.
a lot of works.
yeah.
maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
fast.
oh, geez, yeah.
okay.
uh, who gets dropped first?
uh --
oh, gee, i do not know.  um...
well...
well, i live downtown.
yeah, i, we both live downtown.
uh...
it depends on what way you want to go.
well, wait.  you know what?  i know.
uh...
if...well, if we took the, if we took fifth, then-then-then we would get to your house first, yeah?
we could...we could do that.
right.  yeah, but fifth is so jammed, is not it?
well, sometimes, some, uh...
i mean, it is jammed.  if we went... um...
y-you live in chelsea, do not you?
yes.
well, i-i guess if you live in chelsea, that is probably first.
oh, okay.
yeah.
and then, uh, april...huh?
great.
oh, my goodness!
oh, elliot!
hi.
what are you doing here?
well, i'm-i'm looking for a bookstore.
oh, what, in this section of town?
yes.  yeah, i-i'm kill--
you are out looking here?
well, yes, I am killing time.  i have a client near here and i...i'm quite early.
ohhhh!
how about you?
oh.  well, i live--
oh, yes!  you live near here, do not you?
yes, i do.
where are you headed?
oh, i was just going to my aa meeting. elliot oh, my goodness.  well, why do you still go to those?  you never tough alcohol.
well, listen, you did not know me before frederick.  i'd...i'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
oh.  you must have been, uh, very unhappy.
yeah, unhappy and fat.  and i still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
I will never understand it.  you are so bright and charming and beautiful.
oh, god.
i think to myself  what problems could she possibly have?
do not let me get started on my childhood.  oh, you know what?  there is a bookstore.
yes? lee  a couple of blocks from here.  if you do not know about it, you should. you would really love it.
yes?
yeah, you would.
well, i-if-if you have some free time...
yeah, sure.
is not this great?  they have everything here.
yes, it's-it's wonderful.
what book did you want to buy? elliot  what?  book?
oh, book?  oh, no, i...  I am killing time.  i...i-i just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
well, you sure picked the right place.  i mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
unless, of course, if-if you had some time, i mean, we could get some coffee.
no, i do not have time.
no, no.  i-i-i understand completely. no problem.  y-you're busy.  i-i-i...
you seem tense.  is everything all right?  you feel okay?
no!  no...
no?
uh, yes!
yes?
yes.
everything's okay?
yeah.  how are you?
i'm...all right.
how-how's frederick?
fine.  oh, we went to the caravaggio exhibition at the met.  it is such a treat to go through a museum with frederick.  i mean...you learn so much.  do you like caravaggio?
oh, yes.  who doesn't?  look!
e.e. cummings.  I would like to get you this.
oh, no, i can not let you get me that. that is too much.
oh, oh, yes.  i-i-i-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
no, i do not think so.
i-i read a poem of you and thought of his last week.  a poem of  his and thought of you last--  you will be fine, though.  lee walks over to elliot in the center aisle.  she looks at the book.
uh, uh, this is great.  i mean, i love e.e. cummings, but i can not let you get this.
yes, i'd...i-i-i'd love, I would love to get you this.
well, sure.
and-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime.
well, thanks a lot.
thanks for showing me the bookstore. perhaps you could, uh, take me to an aa meeting sometime.  uh...uh, I would love to see what goes on.
well, yeah, yeah.  you would love it. it is really entertaining.  you would have a good time.  i know you would.
and, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve.  it reminded me of you.
page a hundred and twelve.
bye.
bye.
gee.
is there no chance?
this is the second opinion.
well, then a third opinion.
I am so humiliated.  i do not know what to say.  i mean--
could you have ruined yourself somehow?
how could i ruin myself?  what do you mean, ruin myself?
i do not know.  excessive masturbation?
hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies?  jesus!
maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. he said you could adopt one--
well, what about artificial insemination?
what are you talking about?
you know, where i-i-i would get implanted from a-a donor.
what, by a st-stranger?
yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
fro--?  you want a-a defrosted kid? is that your idea?
i want to experience childbirth.
with a, with a stranger?  with a--
just think about it.  that is all i ask.
oh, that was a wonderful show.  i think that is the best show you two ever wrote.
no, the funniest show that mickey and i ever did was the one we won the emmy for.
mm-hm.
yeah, it was funny, it was very funny.  but the show was about the two frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.
we got that idea on that trip to paris.
right.
hmm?
do you remember that summer in france?  hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.
hannah and i...can't have any children.  now i-i-i do not want to get into whose fault it--  it is my fault that we can not and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
w-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
um, i-i did not really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  i-i just, you know, i-i-i would not want that.
right.  we felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...
i gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
okay, norman, listen, i really want to talk about this at home.  i think it is a matter for your analyst...and mine.
and maybe my lawyer.
hi, dusty.
hi.
dusty's just bought a huge house in southampton and he is in the process of decorating it.
yeah.  it is kind of a weird place, actually.  a lotta wall space.
how ya doin', man?
i told him about your work, and he is very excited.
yeah, i got an andy warhol.  and i got a frank stella, too.  oh, it is very beautiful.  big, weird...you know.  if you stare at that stella too long, the colors just seem to float. it is kinda weird.
are you excited about becoming a collector? dusty yeah.
yeah?
i got a lot more to learn, though. i really was not into art when i was a kid.
uh-huh.
big.  frederick, show him the oils.
they are in the basement.
frederick's done this whole new series that I am sure you would really love.
well, are...are they big?
yeah.  some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
'cause i got a lot of wall space there.
i do not sell my work by the yard!
oh, frederick!
how is everything?
oh, you know...i talked to hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
oh, yeah.
but i go nuts.  it is a conflict.
i have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
oh, that is nice.
i figured I would get, uh, frederick and dusty together.
oh, yeah, that is really nice of you.
yes.  this kid, he is earned a trillion dollars.
oh.
he is got like six gold records.
oh, speaking of records...i bought that mozart trio you recommended...
oh, you-you have that one?
yeah.
oh, i would love to hear it.
oh, and holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  an architect.
oh, that is nice.  I would love to see her wind up settled.  she is a tense one.
is not that beautiful?
i know this.  bach.  f minor concerto.  it is one of my favorites.
uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
yes, he is just adorable.
they have a very large gay clientele, you know, where i get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they are afraid of aids.
oh, right.
did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
and be ready to make light of the offer if she is unresponsive.  this has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
did you ever read this one--?
elliot!  don't!
lee!  lee!  lee, I am in love with you.
oh!
what are you doing?!
i...i'm-i'm-i'm-i'm sorry.  i have to talk to you for... there is so much that i want to tell you.
elliot!
i have been in love with you for so long.
what is the problem?
I am not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
what a weirdo that guy is!  paranoid.  what is the matter with you?
look i-i-i'll be okay.  I will be okay.
it is not that big a deal.  we just did not hit it off.
now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
are you okay?  you look-- you are sweatin'. elliot  yeah.  yeah, i just-just need so- some-some fresh air.  it is probably something i ate.  i'll-i'll walk. you go ahead.
i was looking for you.
i, i must apologize.  i-i'm, i-i'm sorry.  I am so mixed up.
well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
wh--, uh, i know, i know but, i am in love with you.
oh, do not say those words!
i-i, I am sorry.  i know it is terrible.
why, you know the situation.
i know!  i-i-i-i, i realize.
what do you expect me to say?
hannah and i are in the last stages.
wh-- she is never said anything, and we are very close.  she would tell me such a thing.
wh--, it-it-it-it, it is so sad. she is crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I have fallen out of love with her.
not because of me, i hope.
oh, no, no.  well, yes!  i love you.
oh, i can not be the cause of anything between you and hannah.  i jus--
oh, no, no, no.  it, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that hannah and i part, anyway.
why?
tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
but not over me?
tch, no!  we were, we were both going in different directions.
poor hannah.
but-but, but how about you?  do you, do you share any of my feelings? or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
i can not say anything!
w-well, please be candid.  i, i-i do not want you to feel bad.
yes!  but i...i have certain feelings for you, but do not make me say anything more, all right?
o-o-o-okay, lee.  okay, okay.  you, you, y-you've said enough.  it is my responsibility now.  i will work things out.
look, do not do anything on my behalf.  i live with frederick, and hannah and i are close.
yes, but you, you do care about me.
oh, elliot, please!  i can not be a party to this!  I am suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
your guilt is because you feel the same.
oh, please, i have to go.  i have to get my teeth cleaned.
hi.  how is she doing?
i am glad to see you.
do not make it worse, dad.
always.
hi, mom.  how you doing?  here, let me get you some coffee.  that is enough of that.  what triggered it?
we were making a commercial down at the mayor's office, and there was this young, good-looking salesman...
here, mom.  drink this.  you know, you are awful.  you probably were flirting.
no!  i like to joke around and have fun, and he gets angry because i get the attention.  he is gotten sourer as he is gotten older, and I have tried to stay young...at heart.
you promised to stay on the wagon.
the sacrifices I have made because of that man.  he is ruined me with his ego, his philandering, his--  his-his-his-his mediocrity!
okay, stop being so dramatic.
he is the one that is made every ingenue in stock!
okay, okay.
th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
yeah, i know, mom. norma  but i, i knew that he would get up there and he would flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes.  he is all show!  now how can you act when there is nothing inside to come out?!
i just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I have always thought lee was the one destined for great things.
yes, she is lovely, but she does not have your spark.  she knows it.  she worships you. she would not dare get up there on the stage.
now, holly's not shy.
no, holly's game for anything. holly takes after me.
true.
I would have been a great dope addict.
do you realize what a thread we are all hanging by?
mickey, you are off the hook.  you should be celebrating.
can you understand how meaningless everything is?  everything!  I am talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it is meaningless.
yeah...but you are not dying!
no, I am not dying now, but, but  you know, when i ran out of the hospital, i, i was so thrilled because they told me i was going to be all right.  and I am running down the street, and suddenly i stop, 'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, I am not going to go today. I am okay.  I am not going to go tomorrow.  but eventually, I am going to be in that position.
you are just realizing this now?
well, i do not realize it now, i know it all the time, but, but i managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
yeah.  what?
can i tell you something?  can i tell you a secret?
yes, please.
a week ago, i bought a rifle.
no.
i went into a store, i bought a rifle.  i was gonna... you know, if they told me that i had a tumor, i was going to kill myself.  the only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated.  i would, i woulda had to shoot them, also, first.  and then, i have an aunt and uncle, i would have... you know, it would have been a bloodbath.
tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
yes, but does not that ruin everything for you?  that makes everything...
...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything.  i mean, you are going to die, I am going to die, the audience is going to die, the network's gonna-- the sponsor. everything!
i know, i know, and your hamster.
yes!
listen, kid, i think you snapped your cap.
maybe you need a few weeks in bermuda, or something.  or go to a whorehouse!  no?
i can not stay on this show.  i got to get some answers.  otherwise  I am telling you, I am going to do something drastic.
i thought you were not coming.
i almost didn't.
lee... uh...
i did not sleep all night.
no, no-no-no, I am sure.
i-i could not think where to invite you without taking risks.
i promised myself i would not let this happen till you were living alone.  i was so torn when you called.
this is not an easy situation.
i know it isn't.
that was just perfect.  you have ruined me for anyone else.
i do not want anyone else ever to have you.
i was so worried i would not compare with hannah.
oh, my god.
you really do have those thoughts, do not you?
oh, all the time.
i know she must be a really passionate person.
yes, she's, she is very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you.  i-i-i want to do things for you.  hannah does not need me as much.  I am being presumptuous.  not that you need me.
i want you to take care of me... and i love when you do things to me.
lucy and i kept talking, and i did not realize how late it had gotten.
you missed a very dull tv show about auschwitz.  more gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
you know, you have been very nervous lately.
i can not take this anymore.
I am just trying to complete an education i started on you five years ago.
I am not your pupil.  i was, but I am not.
when you leave the nest, i just want you to be ready to face the real world.
like what?
oh, you know what.  I am suffocating!
oh!  are we going to have this conversation again?
yes, we are going to have this conversation again.  i...i have to leave.  i have to move out.
why?
because i have to!
what are you going to use for money?!
i do not know.  i thought, maybe I would move in with my parents for a while.
tch, oh.  i always told you you would leave me.  but...does it have to be now?
well, maybe it will only be temporary, but i ha--i have to try.
oh...lee, you are my whole world.  good god!  have you been kissed tonight?!
no.
oh, yes, you have!
no.
you have been with someone!
stop accusing me!
oh, christ!  what is wrong with you?!
I am sorry.
oh, could not you say something? you have to slither around behind my back!
I am saying it now!
so you met somebody else?
yeah.
but you, god, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later.  i can not live like this!
who is it?
what is the difference?!  it is just somebody i met!
but who?  where did you meet him?
it does not make a difference!  i have to move out!
you are, you are my only connection to the world!
oh, god, that is too much responsibility for me.  it is not fair!  i want a less complicated life, frederick.  i want a husband, maybe even a child before it is too late.
jesus...jesus!
oh, god, i do not even know what i want.
oh...
tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway?  i mean...  it is not sexual anymore.  it is certainly not intellectual.  i mean, you are so superior to me in every way that--
where are you going?
i've, uh...gotta find, got to get a phone number in my desk.  i forgot to phone mel kaufman.
it is so late.
yeah, i know.  i-i can not believe i forgot.
oh, why are you making those faces?
i can not hear you.  i can not hear anything.  i'm, i'm, i'm, I am going to lose hearing in my ear!  i'm--
listen, you are witnessing genius!
i, i, my ears are experiencing a meltdown!  i can not hear anything.
look, can not you feel the energy? it is tangible energy!  the room's alive with positive vibrations!
don't, no, please.  will you-- no, don't...
you want some?
come on, mickey.  come on.
but, no, you have been doing that all night!  you are gonna...you're going to burn a hole in your... you are going to develop a third nostril!  really,  don't, please.
can we, can we go?
no!
my--uh...
i love songs about extraterrestrial life, do not you?
not when they are sung by extraterrestrials.
oh, well, i cannot communicate with you!  i, you know, i never realized you were such a tightass. mickey i can not understand you.  your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  i do not know where you went, went wrong.
do you mind?  i'm-i'm my own person.
can i take you someplace to hear something nice?
eh, mickey, it is getting late.
now come on, you are be--, 'cause you are being angry at me.
thanks for a swell time.
well, if you did not like it, you did not like it, but you did not have to talk while the guy was singing.
i was so bored!
yeah, that is tough!  you do not deserve cole porter.  you should stay with those groups that look like they are going to stab their mother!
at least I am open to new concepts!
and you do not have to snort cocaine at the table all the time!  what do you, what do you do?  carry a kilo around in your purse?
this crowd would not know the difference!  they are embalmed!
jesus...  I am glad hannah got us together. you know, she is got a great instinct for people.  really.
oh, look, I am sorry it did not work out.
yeah.  me, too.
you know, it is probably my fault. I have been a little depressed lately.
right.  yeah.  i had a...
god!
...i had a great time tonight, really.  it was like the nuremberg trials.
are you in a bad mood?
i do not know.  um...i'm just antsy.
yes.  i know.  the last few weeks, you have not been yourself.  and tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
was i?
yes, you were.  a-and when i, when i brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
well, i-i do not think it is a very good idea.
why not?
because it is the last thing in the world we need right now.
why do you say that?  is there something wrong?
i do not know.
well, tell me.  should i be worried?
but, you got four children!
i want one with you.
well...i-i think we should wait till things settle.
but what do, what do you--  what is that mean?  w-w-we've been, we have been married for four years. how settled can things get?
you know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured.  a-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in connecticut.  i-it's all very...preconceived.
yeah, but i...uh--i thought you needed that.  when-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
i-i-i know, but there is got to be some give and take.
oh, let's not--i, i do not know what the hell I am talking about.
are you angry with me?
no!
do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
i did not say that.
are you in love with someone else?
my god!  wha-what is this?  the gestapo?  no.
well, what?  what, wh-what are you not telling me?
what kind of interrogation... su- supposing i said yes?  i-i-i am disenchanted.  i am in love with someone else.
are you?
no!  but you keep asking these, these awful questions.  my god, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
what, you, of c-- what are you talking about?  of course not.  I would be destroyed!
you know, i just want to look so good, but i do not want to seem, you know, like I am overdressed.  you know what I am saying? hannah  oh, no, not at all.
well, how about this?
well, i, i really like that.  i think that is a pretty color on you.
oh, yeah.
he is married...
oh-oh. holly  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  she is schizophrenic.
sometimes she is terrific...
oooo.
...and then she just breaks down.  and he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he is going to split permanently.  i mean...
oh?
...he's really paid his dues, but...then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so...
you found all this, all this out on one date?
well, i think he was dying to open up.  it is so sad.  now...what should i wear to my audition?
I have got a singing audition for a broadway musical.  of course, I will never get it.
singing?
yeah, can you believe it?
really?
well, i mean, why not?  you know, wh-what have i got to lose?  uh...
well, no...i-i know, i just, uh... no, i-i, eh, you know, i, i didn't, i did not know you sung.
well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
no!  no, i, eh, it is just that they sing.
ohh!
you know.
i know, no--  i know.
i mean, y-you know, do not say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, i--
no, I am sorry.  no, i did not mean that.  no, i did not mean that.
uh, you know, i think i can fake my way through a song.
uh-huh.
easily.
w-why?  you do not think it is realistic?
no, i didn't, i, that is no.  no, i- i-i, no, i-i just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  you know, you know how you take...
yeah.
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
yeah.  well, maybe I will get it.
i hope.
boy, you really know how to cut me down.
what?  you don't, do not be so sensitive.  can not i say anything?
tch, well, i sing!  for chrissake, hannah, you heard me sing!
nobody but you can do that to me. i do not know why.
look, everything's going your way.
I am telling you, you sounded great. you, uh, you may be surprised.
oh, I am just glad we have a catering job this week.  I am real low on money.
yeah, we have mr. morris levine's eightieth birthday party on riverside drive...or riverside memorial chapel, depending on his health.
oh, uh, listen, david called me up.
what?
uh, david called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  i did not know what to say.
you are joking.
no, he called late last night.
i, uh, I am very surprised.
he wants to take me to see rigoletto.
and you, you-you're going?
well, i-i-i did not know what to say. first i said no, but then, he pressed it.  he said, uh, he would taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
but I am seeing him.
i know.  i said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
gee, um...  i...i do not know what to say.
look, it is just an evening at the opera.  did i, i-i do wrong in accepting?
i do not understand.  i thought that you would be happy.
how can we be happy?
well, because i never thought of god in my life.  now I am giving it serious thought.
but catholicism?  why not your own people?
because i got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know.  b-b- b-but i need a dramatic change in my life. father  you are going to believe in jesus christ?
i know it sounds funny, but I am going to try.
but why?  we raised you as a jew.
so, just 'cause i was born that way... you know, I am old enough to make a mature decision.
why should i be afraid?
oh! 'cause you will not exist!
so?
that thought does not terrify you?
who thinks about such nonsense? now I am alive.  when I am dead, I will be dead.
i do not understand.  are not you frightened?
of what?  I will be unconscious.
yeah, i know.  but never to exist again!
how do you know?
well, it certainly does not look promising.
I will either be unconscious or i won't.  if not, I will deal with it then.  I am not going to worry now about what is going to be when I am unconscious.
mom, come out!
hi.  where is holly?
hi.  she is auditioning for a television commercial.  she said she is going to be a little late.
oh, yeah?  how is she doing?
i hope you tell her it was your idea...
why?
...'cause every time i try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
oh, hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that is all.
so how are you?
oh, me, I am okay.
do you miss frederick?
no.
i can not believe elliot and i can not think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
how are you?
I am okay.
you know, how is everything?  you doing okay?  how is frederick?  i mean, elliot.
y-yeah.
oh, he is fine.  he's-he's, i guess he is fine.  i do not know.  he is been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
really?
yeah.  i-i do not know what is wrong with him.  he is just...kind of distant and difficult.
oh...
I have been trying to talk to him about it.  he says everything's fine, but i do not know. automatically, you know, i leap to the worst conclusions.
like what?
i mean, i do not know, he is seeing someone else or something, but...
oh, no!  i mean, everyone thinks things like that.
hey, hi!
well, i just came from an audition...
hi.
...which i did not get.
awwww...
so what is new?
boy--
they said i was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
oh, what do they know?
thanks.  but guess who was there auditioning?
april?
oh, gosh.
you got it.
yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which i still cannot believe.
hmm.
oh, god...
yeah, although it is put an end to the stanislavski catering company. which is why i have to speak to you. and...  you are going to get impatient, but...i have to borrow some more money.
well, that...th-that's fine.
but what i decided to do is some writing.  yeah, i think I have had it with acting.  you know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  and i can not handle another rejection.  now let's face it here.  i gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  you know--something with a future.  I am not sixteen anymore.  it is just...crazy!  I have got...an idea for a story. more than one.  and i just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
well, that-that's good.  it just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
well-well, like what?
well, i do not know.  we would uh, uh, um... did not mom mention there was something...something at the museum of broadcasting?
yeah, that is clerical.
no.  she, did not she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department.  that-that can lead to other things.
boy, i knew you would be discouraging.
I am not!  I am not!  I am trying to be helpful.  a person does not just say one day, "okay, now-now I am finished as an actress.  now I am a writer."  i mean--
yeah, you mean not at my age.
oh, please!  we all came to have lunch, did not we?
yeah, okay, right.  forget it.  what is to eat?
boy...holly...holly.
i just want a salad.  you really think I am a loser, do not you?
what do--?  you are being ridiculous.
you are, holly.  stop it.
you treat me like a loser.
how?
you never have any faith in my plans.  you always undercut my enthusiasm.
not so!  no.  i think I have been very supportive.  i've...i try to give you honest, constructive advice.
hmm!
i'm-i'm always happy to help you financially.  i think I have gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  there is nothing i would--
uh, losers!  all losers!
you are too demanding.
you know, i could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
you are crazy!  that is not true.
hey, hannah, i know I am mediocre.
oh, will you stop attacking hannah?!
oh, now--
she is going through a really rough time right now.
why are you so upset?
you know, you have been picking on her ever since she came in here. now just leave her alone for a while!  I am just suffocating.
what is the matter with you, lee? why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
look.  listen.  listen.  you want to write?  write.
what is the matter?
write!  let's just not talk about it anymore.
good.
take...take a year.  take six months.  whatever you want.  who knows?  maybe you'll, maybe you will be sitting with a good play.
what is the matter?  what is the matter with you?  you look pale.  you okay?
i'm-i'm okay.  yeah, i-i-i, you know, i...i'm just, um, i got dizzy all of a sudden.  i'm-i'm...i have a headache.
yeah?
i think we need to eat.
what makes you interested in becoming a hare krishna?
well, I am not saying that i want to join or anything, but...but i know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
yeah, well, what is your religion?
well, i was born jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter i tried to become a catholic and...it did not work for me.  i-i studied and i tried and i gave it everything, but, you know, catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. and i just could not get with it. and i, and i wanted to, you know. i--
you are afraid of dying? mickey  well...yeah, naturally.  are not you? i-- l-let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would i come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?
take our literature...
uh-huh.
...read it over, and think about it.
well, okay.  thank you very much.
you are welcome.  hare krishna.
you have been very cold to me tonight.
no.
is something wrong?
oh, not here.  there are too many people around.
hey, what is the matter?
I am real upset about what you wrote.
my script?
it is obviously based on elliot and me.
oh, so loosely.
no, not "oh, so loosely"!  real specifically!  is that how you see us?
well--
can i, can i not accept gestures and feelings from people?  do i, do i put people off?
wow, i guess i hit a nerve.
you make it sound like, you know, i have no needs or something.  you think I am too self-sufficient?
now, hannah, that is not what i meant, you know.  uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "you're so giving. it is not a criticism.  we love you. we are grateful."
you are grateful, but you resent me.
oh, wow!  i do not want to have this conversation.  i did not do anything wrong.
y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and elliot were having some problems.
yeah, we are having some problems, but problems that are my business...which i do not see how you could know about in such detail. how does lee know about these things?  how?  they are private!
well, why do not you share them with us?
i don't...i do not want to bother everyone.
that is the point.  I would like to be bothered.
i do not see how you could know about these things unless elliot's been talking to you.
no, he hasn't.  if i offended you, I am sorry.
it is over, elliot.  i do not know how to make it any clearer.  it is over.  i can not see you anymore.
uh...  i-i-i know.  i deserve this.
look, I am just as much at fault.
if-if-if you can believe i have such feelings for you!
I have got to be honest with you.  i met someone else.  I have met someone else.  i...i told you i was not going to wait forever.
but it has not been forever.
it is been nearly a year since our first time and you are still married to my sister, which...i now realize is fine because you are probably much more in love with her than you know.
yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
yeah.  uh, well, sure we did.  an- an-and in a way you led me on, because i truly believed you were unhappy with hannah.  otherwise, i would never have let myself be drawn in.  i was very weak.  so were you.  now I have met someone else.
and you are in love overnight?
i care a great deal about him, yes.
lee...
ah, it is over!  elliot, i mean it. it is over!
have you been talking to holly or lee about us?  about our-our personal life?
me?  of course not. hannah there is things holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
I am not accusing.  I am asking.  do you...do you find me too...too giving?  too-too-too competent?  too-too, i do not know, disgustingly perfect or something?
no.
well, what is it then?  what?  eh, what is come between us?  how have i alienated you?
hannah, my head is throbbing. hannah  you never want to talk about it. i-- every time i bring it up, you- you change the subject.  what is it? do you-- we are communicating less and less.  you sleep with me less and less.
do you talk to holly or lee behind my back?  do you?  you must.  they- they seem to know so much about us.
well, maybe I have asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
well, what do you do?  do-do-do you talk to holly, or lee, or what?  do you, do you, do you phone them?
leave me alone, can you?!
you matter to me.  completely.
it is hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!
it is so pitch-black tonight.  i feel lost.
you are not lost.
mmm, i do not know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
i remember you.
yes, you do recall, right?
i recall you.
i was walking past and i saw you in here...
yeah.
...and i thought I would come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
we did not hit it off.
oh, that is putting it mildly.  we did everything but exchange gunshots.
how are you?
good.  how are you?
I am fine.
you look wonderful.
oh, no.
yeah, really.  you do.  you do.
yeah?
it was a terrible evening.
yeah, it was.
remember slamming the cab door in my face and..  you know, it came very dangerously close to emasculating my nose in a...
I would never do that.
...in a really horrible way.
oh, well, that was a long time ago.
you look wonderful.  you do.  what happened to you?
people change...you know.
well, i hope you have changed.
yeah, i hope you have, too. mickey  i hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
yeah, and for yours.  I am sure you have changed.
...namely a personality.
so how are you?
I am okay.
you did not answer my question. what are you doing?
oh, nothing much.  you know...
well...
...just some stuff.  a little of this, a little of that, that is all.
yeah?  is that an embarrassing question?  should i have not asked it?
probably not.
are you, are you out of work or something?
no, well...i've been trying to write.
have you?
yeah.
well, that is interesting.  wh-what kind of stuff?
oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
no, you can tell me.
come on.
no, i am.  i am.
oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "hey, i have something i just wrote," right?
nobody ever said it.
really?
this is it.  yeah.  this is really-- holly  well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  something...that i wrote?
well, yes, i would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  i do not know why it would.
no, the reason i ask is--
you have always hated my taste in the past.
no, i haven't.
you have.
i haven't.  no, the reason why i ask is i think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you are so active in television, so--
I am not anymore.  i haven't, i have not been in television for a year.
you are kidding me.
I have done no television whatsoever. no.
i may, i may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I am running out of dollars. but...but, um, no, i haven't, i just sort of dropped out for a year...
oh.  oh.
...which is a long, dull story and i will not get into it.  but--
you are okay, though, huh?
i'm-- yes.  yes, I am fine.  I am fine.  how are you?
oh, I am fine.
what...what about your script?  so what is it about?
well, I would love it if you would read it, actually, 'cause i really would value your opinion.
you have to remember, we-we-we did not agree on one thing.
but you have to remember while you are reading and you are cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  well, it is not my first script.
hmm.
actually, my first script was about hannah and her husband, but, uh...
yeah.
...hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then i felt badly, so i--
oh, well, god, i can imagine what you wrote.
oh, no!  it was not anything bad. but she just... you know.  i do not know.
really?
so, uh...i threw it out, but i have this other one.
well, you know, i-i-i...you know, if you want me to, I will read it.
oh, gosh, i do not know.  well, could i come over tomorrow and read it to you?
come over tomorrow and read it to me?
you must be joking.  I have been doing all my own reading since i was forty...you know.
hmm.  i think it is lucky i ran into you.  maybe.
well, what about me?
oh, well.
i should have kept going.  i-i have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation i should have kept walking and...
no, you can tell me straight.  it is okay.  just, you know, tell me what you think.
it is great.  i swea-- i'm-- i'm, tch, I am speechless.  i was...i was not in the mood to listen to this thing now.  i do not know what to say.  I am moved and i laughed and i-- uh, i, you know, i was on the edge of my seat.  i just think it is wonderful! i'm, I am totally...stunned.  this is not an insult.  I am amazed that you can...  it was-- i just thought it was great.
really?
yes!  i was abso-- and...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who is schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
oh, it just came to me one day.
well, it was just fabulous!  i'm, i, you know...
oh, gosh, you really think i can write?
i thought it was wonder-- there is maybe one or two things in there that i would do differently myself, but...
right.
...but who cares?  it was just--  it was fabulous.
oh!
fabulous, i mean it!  I am so impressed.
oh, god!
i am.  you-you made my day.
oh, wow!
it was just great.  uh, i was all set...i was set to be bored stiff.
uh, gee.  would you like to have lunch?  uh, uh...
i-i would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  i-i, you know, i think maybe that we could do something with it.
okay, and listen, i would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
oh, who cares?
y-you used to-- oh, no!  yeah, i care.  you used to be so ambitious and...  god, you really liked it?!
gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  h-how did you get over it?  i mean, when i ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  well, you seem fine now.
well...  I will tell you.  one day about a month ago...
um...look, there is something i've, uh, that is been bothering me for a long time, and i just thought I would just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that is this.
oh, yeah?  what?
that I have always regretted the way i behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...i've, i just thought I would tell you that because i really made a fool out of myself.
oh, do not be silly!  no!  do not be ridiculous.
it is all right.
i was the, i was... you know, it was my fault.  i--
so, so you want to go out to dinner again?  i mean, is that, is that... have, you have any interest in that, or...
sure.  sure, uh, yes.
do you?  i mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
yeah.
i want ice!  who is got some--  oh, there it is.
it is on the table, dad.
hey, hannah, did you read that last thing holly wrote?  it was great. she is really developed.
i know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
yeah.  I will get some ice.
oh, mom!
oh, honey!
now do not get nervous.  it is just your husband.
hi.
hi.  how you doin'?
okay.
when'd you get here?
just a few minutes ago.
oh.  you look so beautiful.
thanks.
you know, i was talking with your father before...and i was telling him that  it is ironic.  i-i used to always have thanksgiving with hannah...and i never thought  that i could love anybody else.  and here it is, years later and I am married to you  and completely in love with you.  the heart is a very, very resilient little muscle.  it really is.  i...  it would made a great story, i think. a guy marries one sister...  does not work out...  many years later...  he winds up  married to the other sister.  it's, you know, it is a...
tch.
i do not know how you are going to top that.
mickey?
mmm, what?
I am pregnant.
