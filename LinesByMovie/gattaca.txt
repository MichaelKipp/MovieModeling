jerome...never shy.  pisses on command. you have got a beautiful cock.  i ever told you that, jerome?
only every time I am in here.
if everything goes to plan, this could be the last time i see you for a while.  one week to go.  please tell me you are the least bit excited.
I will tell you at the end of the week.
what are you doing?
i can not do this.
i told you, the government pays.  it is all taken care of.
no, you do not understand.  i <i>can't</i>.
the doctor will give you something.
I am not doing it.
honey, you have made <i>one</i> mistake--
--i've read your profile.  i do not know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  you can have other children.
not like <i>this</i> one.
honey, look around you.  the world does not want one like <i>that</i> one.
the name?  for the certificate.
antonio--
first, we may as well decide on gender. have you given it any thought?
we would like vincent to have a brother... you know, to play with.
you have already specified blue eyes, dark hair and fair skin.  i have taken the liberty of eradicating any potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia, alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and obesity--
--we did not want--<i>diseases</i>, yes.
we were wondering if we should leave some things to chance.
you want to give your child the best possible start.  believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in already.  your child does not need any additional burdens.  and keep in mind, this child is still you, simply the <i>best</i> of you. you could conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.
he is right, maria.  that is right.
is there any reason you would want a left-handed child?
er, no...
some believe it is associated with creativity, although there is no evidence.  also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
i like football.
i have to warn you, mr luca, he is going to be at least a head taller than you. prepare for a crick in the neck in sixteen years time.
anything I have forgotten?
we want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  we would like grandchildren.
i understand.  that is already been taken care of.  now you appreciate i can only work with the raw material i have at my disposal but for a little extra...i could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
antonio, the choir...
i have to caution you it is not fool-proof. with multi-gene traits there can be no guarantees.
how much extra?
it would be five thousand more.
I am sorry, there is no way we can.
do not worry.  you will probably do just as well singing to him in the womb.  we can implant the most successful pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.
what will happen to the others?
they are not babies, maria, merely "human possibilities".
what do you think?
i think i could do something  provided you know what you are doing and you can meet the terms.
vincent...vincent...
german, is that you?
vincent, come down.  I have found him.
he has the heart of an ox.  he could run through a goddamn wall--if he could still run. actually, he was a big college swimming star.
i hope he is not just a body.
no problem.  before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
how do i square the accident?
it happened in australasia.  he checked in yesterday.  no family complications, no record he ever broke his neck.  as far as anybody's concerned, he is still a walking, talking, fully-productive member of society. you just have to get him off the pipe and fill in the last two years of his life.  excuse me, <i>your</i> life.

that is the hair color in his profile?
yeah.
I would have to bleach my hair.
why are you inventing problems?  you two are a couple of goddam clones.  you look so right together, i want to double my fee.
how tall are you?
okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
six one.
he is too tall.
you can wear lifts.
even with lifts I am never that tall.
there is a way.
you okay, jerome?
yeah.  you want to go dancing tonight?
what is wrong with it?
i think I would better choose the menu.  after all, you are learning how to be me, I am not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
suit yourself.
listen, i do not want you to think I am ungrateful --i know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
german.
you are both going to a lot of trouble--  maybe you can con somebody into believing you are me to get your foot in the door--but once you are inside, you are on your own.  I am sure you are sincere...  ...but i was being groomed for something like this myself.  even without the accident i do not think i would have made it.  my point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
i do not know exactly, jerome.
at least you are honest.  call me by my middle name--eugene--if you are going to be jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
i have to know where you come from.
if anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you.  you are a disappointment, jerome.
what about this?
wrong color.  it is silver.  it is not easy living up to this.
it needs work.
you had to be a right-hander.
noone orders southpaws anymore.
you really need that much?
<i>more</i> than that.  you will get used to it.
god, what <i>wouldn't</i> you do to leave the planet?
leave?  just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. i do not see it as leaving.  i see it as going home.
god, you are serious, are not you?
it is not too late to back out.
you do not know what a relief it is not to be me.  are you sure <i>you</i> want the job?
what about you?  what is in this for you, eugene?
listen, i bag this stuff anyway.  it may as well pay my rent.
no bother.
I have been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
last night?  i was at home.
can that be, er, verified?  were you alone?
no it can not be verified.  yes i was alone.
looks bad, does not it, irene?  what about <i>you?</i>  where were you last night?
i was at home.
were <i>you</i> alone?
yes.
so we do not know for sure about you, either.
no.
why do not we say we were together?
why would we do that?
i have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. do not you?
who died?
the mission director.
you wish.
they found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
what an act of benevolence--a service to the community.  so that is it.  now there is nothing between you and ignition.
he was still warm when they confirmed.
this calls for a celebration.  does not it?
the place is crawling with hoovers.
so what?  you did not kill him, did you?
that is not the point.
hey, how much of you can be there?  even if the "j. edgars" do find something, in a week--  you will be slightly out of their jurisdiction.  come on, we have got to get drunk immediately.
you are going to have to earn your supper.  I have got my final physical tomorrow.
let's get out of here.
you are right, there is more atmosphere where you are going.
i gotta stop!!  i gotta stop!!
keep going!!  keep going!!
at least up there your piss will be worth something.  you will all be showering in it, right?
and drinking it.  it is like evian by the time it is filtered.
what <i>is</i> that one?
11.15 to the port.  a maintenance crew.
how long do you stay up there before you go?
a day or so.
i still can not believe they are sending you to the belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.
up there they would not be a problem.
you know I am scared of heights.
I am sorry.  I am sorry.
it is okay, eugene.
you know i was not drunk--i knew what i was doing when i walked in front of that car--
--what car?--go to sleep.
--i walked right in front of it.  i was never more sober in my life.
it is all right.
I am proud of you, vincent.
i do not understand why you were dragged out here, sir.  it is hardly worth wasting your time--a no-nothing case like this.
a man's dead, detective.
of course, sir.  we are checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
grudges?
i look around, i see a lot of dry eyes. the director was not...  ...universally loved.  he was leading the cut-backs in the program.  you are looking at a room full of motives.
no, <i>this</i> is your man.
with respect, sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
--what <i>about</i> his profile?
according to this, he is a sick man.  congenital heart condition.  who knows how long the specimen has been here but there is an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
so there is a 20 percent chance he is <i>not</i> dead.
even if this vincent luca <i>is</i> alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
no.  not <i>likely</i>.
of course that does not jibe with what we found.  this was an angry killing.
who knows with these "deficients"?  his profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
I will run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
--i've already run it.  there is no record of any living relative.
what a pity.
detective hugo, it is a simple case of lost and found.  all we have to do is locate the man who is minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
how often do you test, director?
often.
surely you know what you have.
we have to be certain.  once they are up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
we believe we have a suspect.
what a relief.
this unaccountable specimen was found in the south wing corridor.
I am sorry.  i did not mean anything.
we were just looking.
i know about you.
have they found our friend?
friend?
it was a mercy-killing after all.
they found an eyelash.
where?
in the south wing.
does it have a name?
just some in-valid.  vincent--  --somebody.
perhaps we ought to celebrate, irene.
you celebrate, jerome?
call german.
any particular reason?
we can not stay here.
what are you talking about?
they think i offed the director.
what makes them think that?
they found my eyelash.
where?
in a corridor.
could be worse.  they could have found it in your eye.
come on--we're taking off.
I am not going anywhere.  less than a week to go. not on your life--
--you do not understand, they will make the connection, they will hoover again.  we should cut our losses.
where is your head, jerome?  you are acting like a guilty man.  they will not marry the eyelash to you.  they will not believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
they will recognize me.
how could they recognize you?  <i>i</i> do not recognize you.  anyway, you do not have a choice.  you run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now.  no, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing.  this is a minor inconvenience is all it is.  we have taken worse heat than this.  jesus, if I would known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, i would not have bothered.  you can not quit on me now.  I have put too much into this.  besides, this stuff is <i>mine</i>.  i had other offers, you know.  i could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine.  you want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself?  we will take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned.
and keep your lashes on your lids where they belong.  how could you be so careless?
I am sorry.  i think i was crying.
you really had other offers?
I am sure i could have.
so it is not just the hoovers who have got you rattled.
you are the one who said not to change anything. she is my ear to the investigation.
is that all?
I have got enough on my mind without that.
if you say so.  the stripe.
good choice.
not thirsty?  we have got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
i do not feel too good.  i think I am still drunk from last night.
never stopped you before.  and for god's sake stop plucking your hair. someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you would not go bald.
if i were you I would worry about myself.  have not you forgotten something?
we are in the wrong place.  we are wasting time.
this <i>is</i> the most likely location--
--there's that word again.  i have a feeling this man does not play the odds, detective.  not exactly a slave to probability.  is it "likely" that a man who has successfully eluded authorities for fifteen years--a brutal killer--is going to come to us now like a lamb?
is there something more we should know about this suspect, sir?  i mean besides what is on his sheet.
since going underground, traces of this in-valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies.  do you need any more than that?
with respect, sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes.  maybe he is just unlucky.
i do not like anybody <i>this</i> unlucky.  widen the sweep.  the west side.  draw a five mile radius around gattaca.  hoover some of the classier establishments.  random car stops.
we are already getting complaints about frivolous search.
this is a murder investigation.  the public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the streets.
you did not know?
yes...<i>yes</i>...
you are angry--
why would i be angry?  it was beautiful.
i envy you, jerome.
you will be next.
i do not think so.  the only trip I will make in space is around the sun--  --on this satellite right here.
it is here.  my heart.  I am careful--weekly check-ups.  I am on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  i just want you to know what you would be getting yourself into.
what exactly is wrong?
nothing yet.  I will start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties.  but unless they come up with something between now and then, i will not live much past 67.
of course i think about it every day.
of course.
how was your evening?
complicated.  i could not stop her apologizing.
you <i>are</i> a catch.  no doubt she is worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. everybody wants to "breed up".  what is wrong with her?
you know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she is not going to live forever and she is been preparing to die ever since.
you are not thinking of telling her, are you?
of course not.  but she is have to know eventually.
she does not <i>have</i> to know.  she does not <i>want</i> to know.
the skin flake was found in michael's restaurant. the employees are all accounted for.
a customer?  does this michael's cater to misfits?
no.  but one or two "borrowed ladders" have shown up there in the past.
of course.  he is a "de-gene-erate".  he works at gattaca.  why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
it is still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
he was afraid of being exposed.  that is why he did it.
it is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers.  you have seen their security system.  they know who works there.  even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he does not have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
do not underestimate these imposters.
none of the id photos match the enhancement.
a man can change his face--but blood is forever. sample every employee within the parameters i gave you.  intravenous.
you know their workforce.  two-thirds at least fall into the category.  we will be closing down their operation for days.  at least go with a fingertip sample or urine.
blood.  from the vein.
I have got enough here.
need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
so you did not do it after all.
i guess somebody beat me to it.
that is the last.
something is not right.
he is not here.  it is a blind alley.
no, we have missed something.  we hoover again.
we do not have the manpower.
get it.  from outside, if you have to.
from what budget?
I will take it out of your damn <i>pension</i> if you question my authority one more time!
would you care to look--in the telescope?
thank you, no.
one look through there and you would know why i can not possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.
you are so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.
right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  i do not think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  we are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  so it is rather critical to point them in the right direction. and we certainly do not need you looking over our shoulders.  besides, i do not believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  i do not see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
no, but since there are not too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you will not mind us conducting one further sweep.  if he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  i think you would better get some people out of bed, detective.  in the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
where are we going?
I am sorry.  I have got plans.
again?
she is already got her doubts.  i have to act like nothing's wrong.
I am sure you will be very convincing.
where are you taking her?
michael's.
everybody goes there.
you may as well invite her here.
will you be okay?
do not worry about your little pin cushion. to be honest, I am looking forward to having the place to myself.
we will still be able to talk when I am away. the conversation will just keep getting longer.
how long?
by the time I am at the belt, you phone and say, "how are you?"  forty-five minutes later i reply, "not bad.  how are you?"
i guess I would better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
what <i>is</i> this place?
you have never been here?  let me order for you.
why are we leaving?
those checks take forever.
what about the car?
let's walk.
who are they?
it is not safe.  i should not have brought you here.
i can't.
come on.
my medication.  i left it back there.
we will get it later.  irene, please.
what are you waiting for?
where do we start?
we will vacuum these streets if we have to.
what happened?
you remember the '99 chrysler lebaron? it is the exact height of the front fender.  looked right instead of left.
so you are not so smart after all.  i want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I would be willing to get an ovum from the egg bank.  in fact, I would <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
but "if it came to it" then it could not have your--  --nose.  how perfect does your child have to be?
you hypocrite.  do you think for one moment you would be doing what you are doing if it was not for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  do not you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
that is precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they will not do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a goddamn.
my wife and i--we're thinking of starting a family.
why not?
these new personality corrections I have been reading about.
you worried about the cost?
not that.
they said the same thing about myopia and obesity.  you think your children would be less human if they were less violent, angry, spiteful?  maybe they would be <i>more</i> human.  from where i sit the world could stand a little improving.
positive saliva match.  the cup was definitely used since the original sweep.
so we have two choices.  either our suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and i do not know anybody that thirsty or...  ...he <i>is</i> here.  we test again.  you are right, hugo, this was a desperate act.  someone had a lot to lose that night--perhaps their place in line.  I would like the profiles of everyone with an upcoming mission.
twelve have a mission within the week.
this time i will supervise each test personally.
what is it?
i forgot something--something at home. I will see you later.
--when you go away.
we could go together one day.
at least it is nothing contagious.
i will not permit any further testing on the eve of a mission.  we are already counting backwards.
hello?
how would you like to be yourself for the day?
i was never very good at it, remember?
hello.
jerome--?
hello, sweatheart.  come on up.
good to see you are feeling better.
now <i>you're</i> here.  who are your "friends"?
it is about the director.
again?
how are you, jerome?
not bad, jerome.
how the hell did you get here.
i could always walk.  I have been faking it.
we found his spit in the dead director's eye. he is signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  what more do you want?
luca could still be an accomplice.
hugo!  I have found him!
I have found him too.
a fingerprint.  there is something to be said for nostalgia.  what did you find?
it is not <i>exactly</i> him.
where did you get this?
so you have finally seen sense and come back to your old job, vincent.
not yet, I am afraid.
no?  what is keeping you?
i guess I am a slow learner.
i guess so.  well, while you are up there, maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.
I will see what i can do.
and do not go getting everybody lost out there. you will give us a bad name.  you will not have me to keep an eye on you, you know.
by the way, i left some trash in your locker.
I will take care of it.
you almost sound like you believe that.
come with me now, vincent.  you have gone as far as you can go.
there are a few million miles to go yet.
it is over.
is that the only way you can succeed, anton, to see me fail?
it is for the best.
god, even <i>you</i> want to tell me what i <i>can't</i> do. in case you had not noticed, anton, i do not need rescuing.  but <i>you</i> did, once.
well?  you have all the answers.  how is that possible?
you did not beat me that day.  i beat <i>myself</i>.
who are you trying to convince?
i will prove it to you.  come swim with me now, vincent.  now--tonight.
that is where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
I have been looking for him.  do you know where he is?
he is probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
do not be deceived, irene.  these are just the clothes.  he has to wear them. something i could never do.
what is wrong with him?
you have more in common than you know.
how are you doing this, vincent?  how have you done <i>any</i> of this?
now is your chance to find out.
vincent, where is the shore?  we are too far out. we have to go back!
too late for that.  we are closer to the other side.
a year is a long time.
not so long--just once around the sun.
i have your samples ready.
have you forgotten?  i do not need any samples where I am going.
no, but you might need them when you get back.
why have you done this?
in case you get back before i do.
where are you going?
I am travelling too.
thank you.
i got the better end of the deal.  i just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
what is this, lamar?
new policy.
flight got you nervous?
there is a problem, lamar.
did i ever tell you about my son, jerome?  he is a big fan of yours.  he wants to apply here.
just remember, lamar, i could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
--unfortunately my son's not all that they promised.  but then, who know what he could do.
