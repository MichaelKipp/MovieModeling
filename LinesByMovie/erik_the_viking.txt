have you done this sort of thing before?
me? of course! I have been looting and pillaging up and down the coast.
looting and pillaging, eh?
yes.
what about the raping?
shut up.
it is obvious you have not raped anyone in your life.
sh!
of course i like women... i love 'em.
you do not love me.
no... right... this is rape... mark you, I am not saying i could not get to like you... in fact... well, to be quite honest, i prefer it when there is some sort of mutual feeling between two people...
what -- rape?
no. it is not rape then, is it?
oh, get it over with.
i do not suppose... no...
what?
i do not suppose you... you do like me at all?
what d'you expect? you come in here, burn my village, kill my family and try to rape me...
I will kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
about raping me?
about not raping you...
you do not like it, do you?
well it just seems a little bit crude, that is all.
what about the killing and looting? that is just as crude, is not it?
oh well -- you have got to do them.
why? why have you got to go round killing and looting?
to pay for the next expedition, of course.
but that is a circular argument! if the only reason for going on an expedition is the killing and looting and the only reason for the killing and looting is to pay for the next expedition, they cancel each other out.
oh! stop talking as if we were married!
well you started it.
i just said i did not feel like raping you.
and i was just saying that rape is no more pointless or crude than all the killing and looting that goes on.
scream.
ah.
louder.
aaagh! rape!
oh, thanks.
thanks for saving me from a fate worse than death.
i did not mean to!
oh, that is all right then... it is the thought... that counts...
you told them i raped you -- why?
i dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
why should you care?
why... should you care?
tell me your name?
we are missing all the fun...
what is it all about?
what?
we toil and labor, we loot and pillage, rape and kill... and yet...
you talking piffle, son?
where does it all get us, grandpa?
who have you been talking to?
i met this girl...
it is always the women that start the trouble.
she got me thinking...
so? what did you do to her?
i... i... killed her...
that is my boy!
now what can you want with me, erik the "viking"?
i should not have come.
they will make fun of you for listening to an old woman's stories?
what do you see, erik?
i see the world.
is it night or day, erik?
it is day, of course, freya.
is it summer or winter, erik?
have you ever seen the sun, erik?
the sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
but have you ever seen it? think back...
of course not... but... when i was a child... i remember a dream.... it was as if the whole sky was blue...
the sky was blue, erik... once.
is there nothing men can do?
the gods are asleep, erik.
i will go and wake them up!
and will the dead ever return, freya?
that i cannot tell you.
and you, sven, are not you afraid of crossing the rainbow bridge to asgaard?
i will join my grandfather there.
he is not in valhalla! he died of old age!
you liar!
there is another way.
who gets killed?
nobody gets killed.
what are you talking about, erik?
what if we could find bi-frost the rainbow bridge?
find the rainbow bridge?
find it... and cross it!
only the dead reach asgaard, erik.
what is the matter? are you afraid to try?
"but" what?
but...
what?
nobody's ever crossed the rainbow bridge to asgaard.
we would be the first!
you mean we would be dead?
no! we would be the first living men to set foot in the halls of the gods.
but how?
i do not know -- but I am not afraid to try.
well I am certainly not, either.
neither am i.
well... I am game.
me too.
ooh, that is a good one! you could charge halfdan fifteen for that one.
yes, it is good. but i told him ten.
you could charge him what you like.
you just can not make enough swords and spears and knives and daggers to satisfy the demand. you could charge halfdan twenty and he would pay it.
oh, i could not do that! the blacksmith's code says...
yes yes... of course.... the "blacksmith's code"...
if this is the age of ragnarok, keitel blacksmith, it is good to us.
can not make enough swords!
can not make enough axe-heads!
but, keitel, if erik ever finds the horn resounding... if he ever crosses bi-frost, the rainbow bridge... if he ever wakens the gods..
they chase fenrir the wolf from the sky...
the age of ragnarok ends...
the bottom falls out of the sword business!
it is not just your livelihood that is at stake but your son's, and the livelihood of all blacksmiths.
my brother blacksmiths!
that is right.
the blacksmith's code says i must...
honour and protect all blacksmiths.
together we stand!
you can not let erik do that.
and you have got both axes?
yes, mother.
and something to sharpen them with?
yes, mum.
and do not forget: never let your enemy get behind you.
no, mother.
and keep your sword greased.
yes, mother. goodbye, dad.
and if you have to kill somebody, kill them! do not stop to think about it.
i never do...
it is a tradition.
i know, dad.
i was a berserk for king harald fairhair...
you went berserk...
i went berserk in every battle i ever fought for king harald...
so did your father...
so did my father and his father before him.
but it is a responsibility...
but it is a responsibility being a berserk.
i must only let the red rage...
you must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
i know! I have heard it all 1 thousand times!
bye, leif.
bye... sorry...
yeah... well...
you will wait?
what d'you expect me to do?
that is why they call me... leif the lucky.
please.
you coming? you do not even believe in asgaard.
i thought i might do a bit of business on the way.
you are wasting your time.
listen. I have been in this dump for sixteen years and i have not made a single convert...
there was thorbjorn vifilsson's wife. you converted her.
thorbjorn vifilsson's wife became a buddhist, not a christian.
same thing, is not it?
no, it is not.
you need to say a bit more than that!
oh... er... yes...
what is the matter with them?
just say something cheerful.
oh... right!  well... cheers everybody!
i think we should go...
right.  farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
no, do not say anything else!
wait, erik!
keitel blacksmith?
hey, you two! what is going on?
i was sitting there.
look, i bagged it last week.
it does not matter where you sit!
yes it does! we could be at sea for months.
well, what difference does it make where you are sitting?
i do not want to have to sit next to snorri all that time.
thank you very much indeed.
now stop it!
it is so nice to feel wanted.
leif, you sit there. even, you sit there. harald, you would better sit over there...
trust me to get the missionary.
what are you doing here?
you may need a real berserk.
i am one, dad!
we have not got a spare place.
he can have my place. i do not want to go anyway.
well, you are!
bjorn's not. he could have bjorn's place.
what is the matter with bjorn?
nothing... halfdan the black chopped his hand off last night.
he was lucky...  sit there.
you can not have sven's father sitting next to sven. they will argue the whole time.
that is true.  you would better sit there.  you there, and ornulf there.
now you have got all the big ones on one side.
ohh! i wanted to sit next to leif.
shut up. you there. you there and you there.
that is better.
now you have got all the ones with beards on one side and all the moustaches on the other.
you know, my son, our lord said...
your lord.
quite... my lord... said: "the prayer of faith shall have the sick."
i hope the dragon of the north sea gets you and your lord.
are you all right?
no, I am not.
you do not need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
how can you help feeling bad when you are sea-sick?
i mean many of the greatest sailors were.
i know. i know.
olaf tryggvason used to throw up on every single voyage... the whole time... non-stop... puke... puke... puke.
look! i do not feel bad about it. i just feel ill.
he used to puke in his sleep.
bastard.
what are you talking about?
come on, move it!
it is halfdan the black!
i know. snorri! get your oar out!
what do you think?
but how could he know... unless...
and you, keitel blacksmith.
but...
i want to die...  no, i don't!
row! row! row!
slower! nobody can row at that speed!
sorry.
what is all the panic about?
the dragon...
slower! in... out...
sorry!
we are being attacked! kill! kill! kill!
not now, sven...
i must kill! kill!
it is no good going berserk against a dragon!
faster!
make your mind up.
kill! kill!
stop it!
row!
death!
shut up!
row!
erik! row! what are you doing?
it saved my father!
hold it! hold it in!
death to dragons!
row!
has anyone told him we have got a dragon eating our boat?
aaagh!
got you!
let me go, sven.
what are you talking about?
I am not worth risking your life for.
I have got you, keitel blacksmith. if you go... i go too...
for your own sake... for the others... i...
hang on...
first we are flying -- now we are sinking!
well, come on!
listen! maybe we will not get to hy- brasil! maybe we will not find the horn resounding... but at least we have tried... and at least we shall have died like men.
like fish.
shut up.
erik's right! we will all meet in valhalla.
it can not do you any harm...
what do we have to do?
nothing... i just immerse you in water...
how deep is the ocean?
very deep... usually...
look, the sky is blue...
the sun! that is it!
she has not got any.
she must have a knife or something...
let's hack her to pieces.
no.
well, what else do we do?
how about making friends?
what is wrong with making friends?
you do not go through all the hardships of an ocean voyage to make "friends".
what did you say?
i said welcome.
welcome?
well, of course. we always welcome friends.
how d'you know we are "friends"?
well, everyone is friends here on hy- brasil.
hy-brasil?
is this hy-brasil?
please! please! what are those?
what are what?
those things in your hands.
these? what are these? they are swords.
what is the matter?
please! you do not know what you are doing!
what?
put them down!  please make them put them down.
why?
yes.
but surely you know...?
no... we don't...
the gods decreed that if ever a sword spills human blood upon these shores, the whole of hy-brasil will sink beneath the waves.
that is terrible!
you mean if just one person gets killed?
how?
well... for a start... er... there is no killing...
well, obviously there is no killing.
well... is not it great?
would you like us to sing to you?
that is very kind of you, but we are in rather a hurry... we're...
what is the matter, do not you want to hear our singing?
oh... well, yes, of course; it is just we are looking for the horn resounding and --
you do not think our singing's going to be good enough for you?
oh, no no no! it is just the horn resounding is...
a lot of people like our singing.
I am sure it is lovely.
but you do not want to hear it.
no... no...  we would love to hear it. would not we?
er... well... we... we... would be terribly grateful if you... all... would sing for us.
you are just saying that.
well, of course he is!
sh!
of course we are not; we would genuinely like to hear you sing.
really?
really.
and you are not just saying it because you think we want you to?
no.
right! summon the musicians! we will do the one that goes "tum-tum-tum- tum-ti-tum-tum"
we are just not a very musical nation...
no, no... it was very... er, nice.
now i want you to be absolutely, totally, genuinely honest with me. did you really, truly, honestly like it?
no.
they did not like it! oh god! i want to die!
your majesty! we come from a world where there is no music. where men live and die by the axe and by the sword...
well, how d'you think i feel?
the gods are asleep, king arnulf.
you try to be nice to people, when they are rude about your singing...
I will tell you what...
yes?
have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
what... you mean "got into bed with" them?
no, of course not, silly -- i mean felt like this about them?
you mean... you have got into bed with somebody else?
no, i mean have you ever felt that for the first time in your life you would met somebody you could believe in with your whole heart... someone whose goals suddenly seem to be your goals... whose dreams seem to be your dreams?
have you ever been to bed with anyone else?
what does that matter? but you've... you've... felt like this before...
it was different...
what was she like?
oh... oh, i did not know her very well...
but you loved her all the same...
we never went to bed together.
why do you go on about that? what does it matter?
you have been to bed with somebody else, have not you?
I have never loved anybody!
I have never been to bed with anybody!
open up! i know you are in there!
ah! it is my father!
open up! i know you are in there!
right! where is he?
who, father?
who? who? whoever you have got in here of course!
there is no one.
well... where is he?
there is nobody here, father. look for yourself.
ah! so you admit there is someone!
you are losing your temper!
it is all in your own mind, father... it is you who imagine that I am always up here with some man or other....
i do not know how you do it, aud... i sometimes think you have got some of your mother's magic...
there is no magic, father... my mother had no magic...
she did, i tell you! she could blind me as easily as the night the day.
it is your fantasy...
but one day I will catch you... like i caught her...
the cloak invisible. it was my mother's parting gift.
"the fifth one this week"!
oh, for goodness' sake!
and i thought you said it was something special...
that is just what i was trying to tell you. you are...
five this week; how many the week before?
you are as bad as my father.
and the week before that?
we must not let him land!
who?
halfdan the black.
but, erik...
careful!  they are not supposed to hurt you.
you have got to let me go!
it is all part of our safety regulations. you see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
they will be more than "hurt" if halfdan the black lands! ow!
he is trying to stop us waking the gods.
why?
because that is how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
do not talk nonsense.
he wants to kill us!
not when we explain about the great blessing.
you do not know halfdan the black.
i know that the great blessing has kept the peace for a thousand years, and will keep it for the next thousand.
halfdan the black's here!
i know!
he wants to kill us.
is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
that is it!
but. you are not even afraid of death, thorfinn!
i know. i know.
it is magic.
what "magic"?
I have heard stories of a magic that strikes fear into the heart so you cannot fight.
it is not magic! it is just a trick!
do not you feel it?
just give me a hand.
i mean, you could have killed yourself.
where is the cloak invisible?
why?
no!
I will bring it back.
erik. you do not understand.
no. it is you who does not understand, aud. halfdan has come to kill and destroy. we brought him here. we must stop him.
but you do not realize....
goodbye, aud...
and thanks for the cloak invisible!
no! wait! erik! the cloak! the cloak invisible! it only seems to work on my father!
and a sort of slightly sick feeling?
that is it! and you keep wanting to go to the lavatory.
oh, yes! i had not noticed that!
so halfdan the black's using magic, is he? well, i have a magic to match his!
what is it?
a magic dishcloth.
to the oars!
what "magic" have you brought, erik?
you will see!
how did he do that?
do what?
vanish into thin air?
he hasn't.
well, where is he then?
there! that is a true berserk.
I am just building up to it, dad.
well! come on!
i... i...
well, go on! go berserk!
give us a chance, dad!
thorfinn! you can not die!
I am not frightened... of anything...
you will see my grandfather in valhalla!
no... he is not... not... there...
tell him I am coming!
loki! where did you come from?
halfdan wanted to stop you waking the gods... so... i disguised myself to sabotage their plans.
but --
it was my master keitel's idea.
was not it, keitel?
well... i... i thought...
but... how is it you can see me?  you can all see me?
what d'you mean?
were not we supposed to?
oh... i feel a little... oh...
is there something the matter with it?
oh! no! no... of course not... it is just i had not expected it to be quite so big.
well, it is not called the horn resounding for nothing.  you do know how to play the horn, do not you?
yes... oh, yes...
then i expect you will be leaving first thing in the morning.
are you going to let erik wake the gods?
how can we stops him now?
sh! hurry!
you do it!
you will be able to throw it further than i could.
who is that?
it is me. I am just going to water the dragon...
oh...
what?
what are you doing, keitel blacksmith?
get away, snorri.
what have you got there?
what did he say?
look out!
but it is! look!
the important thing is not to panic.
i can not swim! i can not swim!
relax!
I am drowning! help!
urrgh! argh! let go, you idiot!
help!
you will drown us bo...
help!
help!
it is all right! it is not happening!
but, father, it is!
it is sinking! hy-brasil is sinking!
well, my dear, i think you will find it is all a question of what you want to believe in.... i have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
we must blow the first note... he note that will take us to asgaard...
over the edge of the world.
sven!
let me do something for myself for a change!
how do we know this is the way?
we blew the horn resounding.
she blew the horn resounding.
do not you see, erik! she wants revenge!
what are you talking about?
shut up!
she knows it was our fault!
keep your mouth shut, keitel!
no! it is you, loki! i should never have listened to you!
you have lost your mind.
we came to stop you waking the gods, erik! but i did not want anyone to get hurt!
you fool!
i should have got rid of you long ago!
like you got rid of snorri!
no! no! we are in the spell of the horn! hatred will destroy us.
that is right!
no. do not look... the abyss will suck away your strength.
i must look! keitel! hold this!
there is nothing we can do...
helpless...
you still want to go to asgaard?
of course.
do you believe i love you?
i... but i...
you do not have to love me. just: do you believe i love you?
yes -- i believe you do.
then let go!
the second note.
the second note to wake the gods...
erik! you have done what you came to do!
not quite...
blow the third note! the note to take us home!
there is something i must ask the gods...
no living man has ever set foot in the halls of asgaard... the gods will never let you return.
i came to find my grandfather.
i have to go...
then i shall come too.
no... no...
i do not want to live without you.
but, aud... i... i came to find someone...
I have come to take you back to the land of the living.
what a stupid idea.
why?
what is the point of being dead in the land of the living?
I will ask the gods to give you life again!
have you tried to ask the god for anything?
well... no...
is that odin?
you will have to wait till he is finished his game.
odin!
you must help us.
we do not have to help anybody.
fenrir the wolf covers the sun -- men fight and kill each other the whole time.
why should we care?
because... you're... you are the gods....
so?
bring the age of ragnarok to an end and stop all this fighting and bloodshed.
erik the viking! the things you seek are not in our power. we do not make men love each other or hate each other.
but you are the gods!
look... erik...
he drove me mad!
easy, dad!
and his "you'll never be a berserk if you lose your temper"...
dad!
i hate you! i hate you!
made by you, loki!
by you -- keitel blacksmith! do not you know, erik, that is why he went with you? ragnarok was good for his business...
it is not my business any more!
why should you care?
i do not know! i just did!
no! let go, snorri!
I have got you!
you will be sucked down too!
no! arrgh!
oh! who cares? we are home!
mum! dad!
