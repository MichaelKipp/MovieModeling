dolores, give me your shoes.
what?
the ghost can be barefoot.  give me your shoes!
i got the early edition!  it was just dropped off at the newsstand.
this is the big moment...!
hell, I have seen a lot worse reviews. I have seen ones where they did not even like the costumes!  like, that last "francis the mule" picture -- it got terrible notices.  but it was a huge hit.
lines around the block.
so do not take it too seriously. we are all doin' great work.
you really think so?
absolutely!  it is just the beginning. i promise this: if we stick together, one day I will make every single one of you famous.
honey, what if I am wrong?  what if i just do not have it?
ed, it was only one review.
orson welles was 26 when he made "citizen kane."  I am already 30!
ed, you are still young.  this is the part of your life when you are supposed to be struggling.
i know... but sometimes i get scared this is as good as it is going to get...
hey big shot, get off your ass.  they need a potted palm over in the carl laemmle building.
sure thing, mr. kravitz.
eddie, i do not understand.  why are you the most qualified director for the christine jorgensen story?
aw, er, it is just a bunch of hot air. i had to say something to get in the door.
can i help you?
yes, I am ed wood.  I am here about directing the christine jorgensen picture.
yeah, well a couple of things have changed.  it am not going to be the christine jorgensen story no more. goddamn "variety" printed the story before i had the rights, and now that bitch is asking for the sky.
so you are not going to make the movie?
no, of course I am going to make the movie!  I have already presold alabama and oklahoma.  those repressed okies really go for that twisted pervert stuff.  so we will just make it without that she-male.  we will fictitionalize it.
is there a script?
fuck no!  but there is a poster.
it opens in nine weeks in tulsa.
well, mr. weiss, I am your guy.  i work fast, and I am a deal: i write and direct.  and I am good.  i just did a play in hollywood, and victor crowley praised its realism.
hmm.  there is five-hundred guys in town who can tell me the same thing. you said on the phone you had some kind of "special qualifications."
well, mr. weiss, I have never told anyone what I am about to tell you... but i really want this job.  i like to dress in women's clothing.
are you a fruit?
no, no, not at all!  i love women. wearing their clothes makes me feel closer to them.
so you are not a fruit?
nah, I am all man.  i even fought in ww2.  'course, i was wearing ladies' undergarments under my uniform.
you got to be kiddin' me.
confidentially, i even paratrooped wearing a brassiere and panties. I will tell ya, i was not scared of being killed, but i was terrified of getting wounded, and having the medics discover my secret.
and this is why you think you are the most qualified to make my movie?
yeah.  i know what it is like to live with a secret, and worry about what people are going to think of you... my girlfriend still does not know why her sweaters are always stretched out.
excuse me, mr. lugosi??
i told you, i do not want any of your goddamn coffins.
no.  i do not work here.
huh?
who are you?  what do you want?
i do not want anything.  I am just a really big, big fan.  I have seen all your movies.
ha!
why were you buying a coffin?
because I am planning on dying soon.
really?
yes.  I am embarking on another bus- andtruck tour of "dracula." twelve cities in ten days, if that is conceivable.
you know, i saw you perform "dracula."  in poughkeepsie, in 1938.
eh, that was a terrible production. renfield was a drunk!
i thought it was great.  you were much scarier in real life than you were in the movie.
thank you.
i waited to get your autograph, but you never came outside.
i apologize.  when i play dracula, i put myself into a trance.  it takes me much time to re-emerge.
oh, there is my bus.  shit, where is my transfer?!
do not you bave a car?
i refuse to drive in this country. too many madmen.
boy, mr. lugosi, you must lead such an exciting life.  when is your next picture coming out?
i have no next picture.
ah, you got to be jokin'!  a great man like you... I will bet you have dozens of 'em lined up.
back in the old days, yes.  but now -- no one give two fucks for bela.
but you are a big star!
no more.  i have not worked in four years.  this town, it chews you up, then spits you out.  I am just an ex-bogeyman.  make a right.
they do not want the classic horror films anymore.  today, it is all giant bugs, giant spiders, giant grasshoppers -- who would believe such nonsense!
the old ones were much spookier. they had castles, full moons...
they were mythic.  they had a poetry to them.  and you know what else?  the women prefer the traditional monsters.
the women?
the pure horror, it both repels and attracts them.  because in their collective unconsciousness, they have the agony of childbirth.  the blood. the blood is horror.
i never thought of that.
take my word for it.  you want to "score" with a young lady, you take her to see "dracula."
shh!  I am coming!  i will feed you!
well... i guess i should go.  perhaps we could get together again?
certainly.  but now the children of the night are calling me.
sweetie, you will not believe it!  I have got the most incredible news!
you got the job?!!
huh?!  oh, uh, no, i did not get the job. but something better happened!
better than not getting a job?
yeah!  i met a movie star!  somebody really big!
who?  robert taylor?!
no!  a horror movie star!
boris karloff!?
close!  the other one!
you met basil rathbone!
oh, the hell with you.  i met bela lugosi!
i thought he was dead.
no!  he is very alive.  well... sort of.  he is old, and frail -- but he is still bela lugosi!  and he is really nice.
boy, i can not even remember the last time he was in a picture.
it is a shame.  he is such a rest actor, and nobody uses him anymore.
so did you get his autograph?
he is a bum.
no he is not!  do you realize how much money he made for this studio over the years?  "dracula"!  "the raven"! "the black cat"!
yeah?  well now he is a junkie.  he do not deserve to work.
that is not true --
he is so great, you hire him.
well, uh, if i could i would...
ugh!  i hate the way she interrupts the pictures.  she does not show 'em the proper respect.
i think she is a honey.  look at those jugs.
vampira!  you will come under my spell!  you will be my slave of love.
hey bela, how do you do that?
you must be double-jointed, and you must be hungarian.  vampira, look at me!  stare into my eyes.
i am getting tired.  i need to take my medicine.
do you want me to get it for you?
no thank you, eddie.  I will be alright.
are you sure this is okay?
do not worry.  i do it every halloween.
mr. weiss, i was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit.  and i realized, what is the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it will be successful??
tits.
no.  better than tits -- a star!
eddie, you must have me confused with david selznick.  i do not make major motion pictures.  i make crap.
yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you would have something!
yeah.  crap with a star.
no!  it would be something better! something impressive.  the biggest moneymaker you have ever had!
fine, maybe you are right.  but it does not friggin' matter.  i can not afford a star, so i do not even know what we are talking about.
what if i told you you could have a star for $1000??
who?
lugosi?
yeah!  lugosi!
is not he dead?
no, he is not dead!  he lives in baldwin hills.  i met him recently, and he wants to be in our picture.
our picture?
uh, yeah.  our picture.
why would lugosi want to be in a sex-change flick?
because he is my friend.
eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
yeah, it is going to be a great picture! you will love your character!  bunny, bela's here.  look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites!  i need transvestites!
eddie, what kind of movie is this?
well, it is about how people have two personalities.  the side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
oh, like jekyll and hyde!  ah, I have always wanted to play jekyll and hyde!  I am looking forward to this production.
ehh, your part's a little different. you are like the god that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
i do not understand.
well... you control everyone's fate. you are like the puppetmaster.
ah, so i pull the strings!
yeah.  you pull the strings --  "pull the strings"... hey, that is pretty good!
ed, I am so proud!  I will read it as soon as i get home.
well, I would really like to know what you think.  why do not you go in the bedroom and take a look at it?  I will wait...
how long have you been doing this?
since i was a kid.  my mom wanted a girl, so she used to dress me in girlie clothing.  it just kinda became a habit.
jesus christ!  and you never told me?
this is my way of telling you --
what, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?!  what kind of sick mind would operate like that?
and what about this so-called "barbara" character?  it is obviously me!  I am so embarrassed!  this is our life!
of course it is.  and that is why you should play the part.
oh!  you got nerve, buddy.
it is a damn good role.
that's not the issue!!  ugh!  how can you act so casual, when you are dressed like that?!
it takes me comfortable.
oh, just like in the script!
i thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
there is still a sex-change --
yeah!  five pages right before it ends!  the rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
i do not think he is a schmuck.
and what is with this new title?!  my poster says "i changed my sex"!
so change the poster.  trust me, you will be better off.  this is a story that is going to grab people.  it is about this guy.  he is crazy about this girl but he likes to wear dresses.  should he tell her? should he not tell her?  he is torn. george, this is drama.
places, everyone!  roll camera!
rolling.
and, cut!  print it!  let's move on!
do not you want a second take, for protection?
what is to protect?  it was perfect!
the set does not look right!  it looks too... empty.  clutter it up.  put a skeleton in the corner.  and what is that thing over there?
i do not know.
well it looks good.  let's use it!
ed!  what is with these revised pages?!  a scene in a smelting factory?  a buffalo stampede?? three-hundred soldiers storming anzio beach??!  what is going on here?  i can not afford to film this nonsense!
do not worry.  we are not going to film any of it.
then how is it going to get in the picture?!
i know a guy in universal's stock house -- he is giving me the footage for free.  this movie's going to look like a million bucks.
bela! it is so great to see you!  and eight of the clock on the dot.  right on time!
i am always on time.
of course!  well, we got a big day planned for you... first, we are going to start off a little easy, with you in that armchair over there.  then, once you are up to speed and cooking, we will reset and bring out the laboratory equipment --
uh, eddie, do you have my money?
huh?!  oh yeah, of course.
what happened?!  jesus, connie, what did you do?
nothin'!  i told him he was great.
you are right, bela.  now dracula, that's a part that takes acting.
of course!  dracula requires presence.  it is all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
look, you seem a little agitated. do you maybe wanna take a little break, go for a nice walk... and then we will come back and shoot the scene?
bullshit!  i am ready now!  roll the camera!!
um, okay... roll camera
rolling.
sound!
how can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
hon', nobody's bothered but you.  look around -- they could not care less.
ed, this is not the real world! you have surrounded yourself with weirdos!
say it a little louder.  i do not think bela heard you in his trailer.
i think it is fifty-seven minutes long.
yeah?  whatever.  so did you like it?
ed, what was the one thing i asked you to do?  make it seven reels long. I have got contracts with my exhibitors.  if it am not over an hour, they will not play it.
gee, i used every frame of film we shot.  maybe they will not notice.
they will notice.  look, why do not you let me take over from here?  i can do a few tricks: pad it out with more stock footage, add establishing shots...
um, i guess --
good.  and one more thing.  i think your "written, directed, and starring ed wood" credit is a bad idea.
why?!  i did all those things!  hell, i even built the props.
and you did a bang-up job, too.  but you do not want other producers to know that is you in drag.  trust me. it is a career killer.
but I am proud.  i wrote, directed, and starred in it just like orson welles in "citizen kane"!
yeah??  well orson welles did not wear angora sweaters, did he??!
ed, who is daniel davis?
some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
georgie, what is with the stag footage??  you said you were cutting in establishing shots!
i did.  i established some tits and ass.
just like i always promised.  now you are among the immortals.  you are movie stars.
here's to ed.  for making us into something.
from today on, our lives are different!  we will be swimming laps in the same pool jean harlow did.
i do not know.  it is so much money...
who cares?!  we are on a roll!  these are the moments in life you are supposed to grab.
but ed, we are not even married.  and you do not have a job.
but you do!  and anyway, I have got tons of new scripts.  and now that i have a track record, studios are bound to hire me!
look on the bright side.  if we miss the rent, what is the worst they can do?
toss us out on our ass.
exactly.
how 'bout a western?  people love westerns.
but, i do not like horses.  do i have to get on one?
eh, forget it.  what else is big?  teenagers!  jailbait pics!  yeah... you got the juvenile delinquent, his girlfriend from the wrong side of the tracks --
who do i play?
uh, a cop.  no!  you play the father. he is angry!  he does not like seeing his son -- no -- he does not like seeing his daughter behave this way!
well... can not i play the romantic part?  I am tired of always being the bad guy.  you know, back in hungary, i played romeo!  i would like to be the lover again -- me, in a boat, with the girl...
sure.  romance, that is great!  to engineer your comeback, we are going to need a whole slate of pictures.  once "glen or glenda" takes off, we will slam you into one, then another, then another!
that is good.  i could use the money.
but we need to start off with a bang! something we know the audience will want to see.  mmm.  what was your biggest hit?
hmm... my biggest hit?  that would probably be "dracula."
of course!
those bastards at universal.  i made so much money for them, and now i can not get the time of day.
so let's make another "dracula." let's make "the return of dracula"!
we can't.  those sons-a-bitches control the rights.
they do?  shoot.  there must be a way to get around that...
ha-ha!  dr. acula!
dracula?
no!  doctor acula!  you can still wear the cape, have the fangs... but you are a doctor!  not a count.
ah!  this is very exciting.
i got to type this up, while it is still fresh!
mr. ward, it is a delight to meet you.
it is wood.  ed wood.
wood?  ward?  wood.  hey, what do you know.  it is wood. dang secretaries, you can never get a good one.  right?
so what are you bringing me?  looks like you got some film cans.
well, mr. feldman, some people have resumes to show.  I have got my own movie.
really?!  well good for you.
i just made this picture, over at screen classics.  it opens next week.
screen classics?  hmm, do not know them.
nobody in town has seen it, so I am givin' you first crack at my talents.
i can not wait to take a look.  so what is up next?
well, mr. feldman, i do not believe in thinking small.  so I have got a whole slate of pictures for you: "the vampire's tomb," "the ghoul goes west"... and "doctor acula"!
doctor acula?  i do not get it.
dr. acula!
oh, "dr. acula."  i get it.  i do not like it.
but bela lugosi's in it!
lugosi's washed-up.  what else you got?
well... I have got another project i was not going to tell you about. lugosi's in it, but he is got a smaller part.  the lead is an ingenue, a sterling young actress named dolores fuller.  the title is "bride of the atom."
ah!  atomic age stuff, huh?  i like it.  I will tell you what, mr. ward.  why do not you leave those film cans, and my associates and i will take a look at your little opus.  maybe we can do business together.
"where's the ads"?!  the ads are in alabama, indiana, and missouri!  you schmuck, it am not going to play l.a.!
why not??
because i can not sell it to save my life!  you made a goddamn feathered fish.  is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  nobody knows! I am beggin' people to book it.
maybe it needs special handling.
screw you, wood!  i even sunk more money into different titles: "transvestite" "he or she?" "i led two lives"... it does not matter! nobody wants to see the piece of shit.
you can not talk that way about my movie.
"your movie"?!  i wish it was your movie!  i wish i had not blown every dime i ever made into this stinkbomb. if i ever see you again, I will kill you!!!
so guess where I am going next weekend?
i do not know.  where?
mexico!  and guess what I am going to do there?!
i dunno.  lie on the beach?
wrong!  I am getting my first series of hormone shots!  and once those babies kick in, they are going to remove my organs, and make me a woman!
jesus!  are you serious?
yes!  I have dreamed of it for years, but your movie made me realize I have got to take action.  goodbye, penis!
I have never seen anything like him!
and once I am a woman, jean-claude and i are getting married --
ssh!  he is so big!  he is a monster! can you imagine what that guy would be like in a movie?
glad you could fit me in your schedule.
da pleasure be mine.
could we moovf to table?
oh, of course!
so, mr. johnson --
tor!
tor.  have you ever thought about becoming an actor?
mm, not good-lookink enough.
i think you are quite handsome.
no.  with hair, yah.  but i must shave head for wrestlink.  it scare da crowds.  dey like that.
well, i think you would be a sensation in pictures.
but what bout accent?  some people tink i haf too much accent.
nah, that does not matter!  it is a visual medium.
so anyway, I have got this new script, "bride of the atom," and there is a part you are ideal for: "lobo."  he is tough.  a brute.  but he has a heart -- and at the end he saves the girl.
i like.  when do movie shoot?
hopefully, very soon.  I am just awaiting the final okay from mr. feldman at mgm.
bela, what happened?!
i did not feel well...
let me take you to the hospital.
no hospital.  just take me to the couch...
should i call a doctor?
nah.  this happens all the time...
is there anything i can get you? water?  a blanket?
goulash.
i do not know how to make goulash.
what is in the needle?
morphine, with a demerol chaser.  eddie, I am so broke.  i do not know what I am going to do...
do not worry.  I will do something.
I am no good.
ed, it is just one man's opinion!
bela needs a job... i can not even get a film going...  but of course i can not -- i made the worst movie of all time.
that is ridiculous.
all i wanna do is tell stories.  the things i find interesting...
well maybe you are not studio kind of material.  maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
"greetings.  i am the count."
"greetings.  i am slick slomopavitz, seeker of adventure." audience laughs.  applause.  "say, that is a funny place to sleep."
"it is my home."
"oh, tract housing, huh?"  laugh. "you need a new real estate agent."
"beg to differ.  this casket incarpratates, er, inporporates --"
no bela, that is "incorporates."  look, just say "this casket has..."
ach!  how do they expect a hungarian to pronounce this dialogue?  this live television is madness!
greetings.  i am the count.
greetings.  i am slick slomopavitz, seeker of adventure.
say, that is a funny place to sleep.
it is my home.
oh, tract housing, huh?  i guess i should not complain about my duplex in burbank.  what a dump. some places have a murphy bed, this place has a murphy shower.  i still do not know where to hang the towels!
uh, beg to differ.
"beg to differ?!"  hey, I am talkin' about my duplex in burbank!
uh, greetings.  i am the count...
bela, do not worry.  you are better than all this crap.
i never said i could ad-lib...
forget about it.  we will make our new movie, and you will be a star again.
mr. lugosi!  it is an unparalleled privilege to meet you.  allow me to introduce myself... i am criswell!
it is a pleasure...
ah, cheer up!   do not lose heart over what happened tonight.  i predict that your next project will be an outstanding success!
wow.
and who may you be?
edward wood, sir.
ah.  the director of "glen or glenda."
h-how'd you know?!
I am criswell.  i know all.
bring me two more beefeater martinis. eddie will have another whiskey, dagmar's a rum-and-coke, moustapha and king are chablis -- hey bela, would you like a wine?
no.  i never drink -- wine.
hey cris, how did you know we would be living on mars by 1970?  how did you know it would not be 1975, or even 1980?
i guessed.
i do not understand.
i made it up.  it is horseshit!
there is no such thing as a psychic. people believe my folderol because i wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
it is that easy?
eddie, we are in show biz!  it is all about razzle-dazzle.  appearances. if you dress nice and talk well, people will swallow anything.
what do you think you are doin'?!
these shoes are itchy.
you can't sit!  you got to walk around, with good posture.  you want these people to think we have class. otherwise they will never invest in our movie.
goodbye!  goodbye!
so how did we do?
we did not make a dime.
ed, the landlord called again.  he wants his money.
tell him "bride" is in pre- production.
ed, the landlord does not care.
that is the problem!  nobody cares about my movie!  I am tryin' so hard, i do not know what else to do!
do not get angry at me.  maybe you just need a day job.
dolores, do not you understand?  I am a director now!  i made "glen or glenda."  directing is my day job.
all i know is, ever since "glen or glenda," all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!
uh, yoo-hoo.  excuse me!  sorry to interrupt, but i got some big news.
yeah...?
well my cousin fred met this dame from back east.  she is from "old money," and he thinks she is loaded. and here's the kicker: she is very interested in the picture business!
pleased to meet you.  I am loretta king.
i understand you just moved here?
yes.  hollywood is oh so exciting.
so my associate mr. marco tells me you may be interested in investing in a motion picture.
perhaps a small amount of money.  how much do one of your motion pictures cost?
for this one, we need $60,000.
that is all??  that seems very reasonable for an entire picture.
perhaps you would like to look at the photoplay.
oh my, this is very interesting.  say... do you think it would be possible for me to maybe play one of these parts?
oh, of course!!  there is a couple characters you would be perfect for: the secretary at the newspaper office, or the file clerk!
hmm.  those sound kind of small.  oh, here's one that looks good: janet lawton.  I would sure like to play her.
it was the only way i could get the movie made!
who do you think's been paying the rent?!  who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
I am sorry!  what did you want me to say?
i wanted you to say, "no!  i wrote the part for my girlfriend dolores."
but there is plenty of other parts.
like what?!
the secretary.  or the file clerk.
this is going to be bela's laboratory, so it should be real impressive! like one of those mad scientist movies.  i want beakers, and test tubes, and one of those electrical things that buzzes!
you mean a tesla coil?
if you say so.
edvard!   i haf question 'bout script. my vife greta, she read.  and she no like.
really?  was the third act too intense?
no.  she tink lobo is waste of my time.  lobo do not talk.
but tor, it is a starring part! you are second billed.
bela, he talk.  loretta, she talk. but tor, he no talk.
tor, dialogue is overrated.  you look at the classic film actors, who are they?  fairbanks.  chaplin.  they did not talk!  they did it all with their face.
but greta say --
eddie, which dress do you like better?
i do not know.  hey bill, which dress is better for you, the green or the red one?
which one is the red one?
what do you mean?
i mean i can not see the difference. I am color-blind.  but i like the dark gray one.
hey ed, should not we do another take? big baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
no, it is fine.  it is real!  in actuality, lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
wow, this lab looks great.  except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
we could not afford any more props. if it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
nah, it will work.  where is bela?
bela, are you ready?
mmph?  where am i?
you are shooting "bride of the atom." scene 85.
you will be sitting on the right.
I am not getting near that goddamn thing.  one of those burned me on "the return of chandu."
okay.  then you will be sitting on the left.
here's the scene.  loretta, you are in a trance.  you glide in and get on the operating table.  now tor, you are supposed to tie her down.  but you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so bela has to discipline you.
okey-dokey.
"dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  a lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  damn!  eddie, I am sorry i can not remember all this.  I am an old man. it is too long.
that is fine, bela.  we are still rolling.  just say "dear, you are lovely."
"dear, you are lovely."  "strap her to the table."
sorry to bother you while we are shooting, but the guy who owns the stage needs his money.
well then you should pay him, should not you?
yeah.  exactly!
i kinda need it now.
what are you looking at me like that for?  i already gave you my three hundred.
yeah.  well i need the other sixty-thousand.
what other sixty-thousand?
the other sixty-thousand you said you would give me.
you misunderstood.  i gave you everything i have in the world: three-hundred dollars.
excuse me, miss vampira?
yes?
you do not know me, but my name is ed wood.  I am a film producer.  I am currently in production on a science-fiction piece, with bela lugosi and swedish wrestler tor johnson.  and i saw you here, and i thought: kismet!
i do not understand.  do you want my autograph?
no.  i think my film is perfect for you.
you want me to show it on my tv program?  well i got nothing to do with that.  you should call up the station manager at channel seven --
no!  i do not want you to show the movie, i want you to be in it!  see, maybe i should explain: we started shooting, but then after three days we got shut down.  so we are having a backers party, to raise some more money.  perhaps you would like to come next door and meet some of the backers...?
uh, look, I am with some friends, and we are about to eat --
please!  it will only take a minute. you can have some hors d'oeuvres, and meet my backers!  there is a really nice dentist from oxnard...
look buddy, I am a big star.  I have got real offers from real studios.  i do not need to blow some dentist for a part.  so forget it!
goddamn landlord.
i told you this was gonna happen.
maybe if you would come to the backers party, i would have gotten the money.
that is moronic.  why would a bit player impress a backer?
look, how many times can i say I am sorry?  i blew it!  i thought she was rich.
that is a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
i did not dump you!  get it through your skull -- i just recast the part!
you are a fuckin' mess.
so what??  look, we got to figure out where we are going to stay.
I am going to my mother's.
does she have room for me?
bela, i do not know what I am doin' anymore...
stop worrying.  this is going to raise your spirits.
what is this place?
this is the philosophical research society.  a refuge for free thinkers. I have been coming here for twenty years.
was i wrong to cast loretta?
bad decisions are easy to live with. forget.  just keep looking forward.
but was it a bad decision?  at the time, i thought her money would save the movie.
eddie, you screwed up.
yeah, i did.
in life, the decisions that haunt you are the ones where you just do not know... where right or wrong will never be answered.  years ago, the hungarians contacted me.  the government wanted me to come home, to be minister of culture.
really?
it was a very impressive offer. fancy offices, a big home... I would be treated like a king.
so why did not you do it?
i did not know if it was a trick. they might arrest me and throw me in a gulag.  i am hungary's most famous emigrant. they would use me as a lesson to anyone who tries to leave.
but maybe not.
correct.  so instead, i stayed here, waiting for my comeback.  always hoping... the next film, the next film... that would be the one.
honey, you made it! i was not sure you got my message.
of course I am here.  today is the file clerk's big scene.
that is right...
i see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here.  say, who is the lug?
that is tony mccoy.  he is playing lieutenant dick craig.
oh really?  how much money did he put up?
none.  but his dad gave me fifty grand.
wood productions.  the mark of quality.
hey, the movie's getting made. that is the main thing.
eddie, what is my motivation?
oh.  er... well you are the file clerk.  you are hurrying into the next room, when you bump into janet.
but what is our relationship?  are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
dolores, i got five days to shoot this movie.  quit kidding around.
bravo!  bravo!  magnifico!
cris, you made it.  thanks a lot.
my pleasure.  I am always happy to assist in a little larceny.
incidentally, you promise you are not going to scratch my car...?
i told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  this is a piece o' cake.
ed, you said you were getting permission.
uh, i could not reach the guy... he was in meetings all day.  but this'll be great, i promise!
you are sure this is going to work?
yes!
you are sure???
yes!  just do it!
you do not understand!  the octopus is supposed to live in a lake!
this is kind of a stream--
no!  it has to be underwater!
eddie, I am so tired... i do not know if i can handle a night shoot...
nonsense!  you look great --  look, uh, why do not you lie down and take a little nap?  we will film around you for a while.
hey.  this is looking good!  paul, where is the octopus motor?
what octopus motor?
you know, to make the legs move --
hey, do not blame me!  you did not say anything about no motor when i was up on that ceiling!
let's shoot this fucker!  where do i go?
you will be fighting with the octopus.
out there?!  what happened to the stream?
this'll look a lot better.  we have to match the stock footage of the octopus underwater.
oh, for christ's sake.
goddamn, it is cold!
once you are in it, it warms up.
fuck you!  you come out here.  hey, toss me that j.d.
okay!  how do we turn this thing on?
bela, somebody misplaced the motor. so when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it is killing you.
do you know i turned down "frankenstein"?
huh?
after i did "dracula," the studio offered me "frankenstein"!  but i turned it down, the part was not sexy enough.  it was too degrading for a big star like me.
bela, I have got twenty-five scenes to shoot tonight.
do not let me slow you down.
alright!  let's put it on film. camera!  sound!
bela.  i just wanna thank you again for last night.
that is fine, eddie.  all in the line of duty.
no.  seriously.  i want you to know how much i appreciate what you have done for me.  a great man like you should not have to run around in freezing water at four in the morning.
well, there are not too many other fellas I would do it for...
i wrote something special for you. i got to thinking about all the sacrifices you have made... and so i wrote you a new final speech.
eddie, this is quite a scene.
i know it is a lot to give you at the last second.
so you sleep in coffins?!
yes.  there is nothing more comfortable.
i can not believe this!  i sleep in coffins!
no.
yes!  my father ran a mortuary -- it is an old habit!
dolores, wait!
ed, it is over.  i need a normal life.
did you really mean those things you said..?
I am tired of living on the fringe.
but you used to say --
ed... i just stuck it out so you could finish your movie.  now that it is done, so am i.
hey!  you are not eatink.
uh, i do not have much of an appetite lately.
the food will make you feel bedder. look at me -- I am da happiest guy i know!
I would be happy too, if i had such a great family.
do not worry.  you just have not met right woman yet.  oopsy.  that cabbage goes right through me.
tor, i should be getting home.
nonsense!  you must try our hot glug.
my friend, you tink greta is first woman i ever see?  no!  many duds, before i find her.
but i thought me and dolores had something.
forget her!  move on.  a good lookink boy like you as you can have any girl you wish.
vampira!  hi, this is ed wood.
who?
ed wood!  you came to my party.  i directed "bride of the atom"!
oh.  yeah.  you.
well, i was wondering if maybe sometime you would like to go out, and maybe grab some dinner.
you mean like a date?  i thought you were a fag.
me?!  no, uh, I am just a transvestite.
is not that the same thing?
no, no!  i like girls.  so how 'bout friday?
look, you seem like a nice guy, ed, but you are just not my type.  but keep in touch.  let me know when your movie opens.
why... yes.
do not you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
i suppose.  it is very expensive.
it is made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the himalayas.
what are you, an angora wholesaler?
no, i work in pictures.  I am a director-actor-writer-producer.
ah, c'mon!  nobody does all that.
two people do.  orson welles and me.
wow.
you know, you are a very attractive girl.
my goodness, you are embarrassing me.
you should not be embarrassed by the truth.  mind if i order some hotcakes...?
norma, this is bela -- bela, this is norma.  norma, this is tor -- tor, this is norma.  norma, this is paul paul, this is norma.
so how long have you known eddie?
edward, are you sure you know what you are doing?
yeah.  it seems a little crazy, but sometimes you just know.  she is perfect for me.
eddie, I am just a small-town girl. I have never done this before.
do not worry, I will teach you.
what the heck is this?!!
honey, i have a little secret to share with you.
please, be compassionate.  I am your husband!
no you are not!  this marriage was never consummated.  I am getting an annulment!
why are you here??
shit!  bela, what is with the gun?
why are not you on your honeymoon? where is myrna?
norma.  she changed her mind.  she does not wanna marry me.  can you put down the gun?
what are you doing?
i was thinking about killing myself.
jesus christ, what an evening.  what happened?
eddie, i received a letter from the government.  they are cutting off my unemployment.  that is all I have got. without it, i can not pay the rent...
do not you have any savings?
I am obsolete.  i have nothing to live for.  tonight, i should die.  and you should come with me.
buddy, i do not know if that is such a good idea.
it will be wonderful.  we will be at peace.  in the afterlife, you do not have to worry about finding work.
bela, I am on your side.  c'mon, give me the gun...  if you give me the gun, I will make you a drink.  what are you drinking?
formaldehyde.
do not worry.
I am sorry, eddie.  I am so sorry.
do not worry.  everything's going to be all right.
hello.
hello.  you are sleeping in a tuxedo.
i got married last night.
oh.  congratulations.
the marriage already ended.
oh.  my condolences.
what are you making?
booties for my father.  he gets cold in this hospital.
how long's he been here?
this is my thirteenth pair.
excuse me.  doctor?  I am with mr. lugosi.  how is he?
well... there is a lot of junk in his system for such an old man. apparently, he was addicted to morphine, tried to kick it, and got re-addicted to methadone.
will he be okay?
we will do our best.
what happened?!
is not it wonderful?  after all these years, the press is showing an interest again in bela lugosi.
bela, they are parasites!  they just want to exploit you.
fine.  let them!  there is no such thing as bad press.  a man from new york even said he is putting me on the front page!  first celebrity to ever check into rehab.  when i get out of here, i will be healthy.  strong!  i will be primed for my comeback!
oh, it is you again.
oh, hi.
you look beat.
i am.  how is your father?
he is better.  thank you for asking.  how is your friend?
not good...
we thought mr. lugosi was insured though the screen actors guild.
is not he?
no.  they say his eligibility ran out years ago.
look, he does not have any money... but I will give you everything I have got.  i have a few hundred dollars.
I have got some good news.  the doctor says you are all better.  you can come home.
really?  i do not feel so great.
no, you look good.  and the tests came back fine.  c'mon...
eddie, i wanna make another picture. when are we gonna make another picture?
soon, bela... soon.
so eddie, do not we need a sound crew?
no, this is just the second unit. we will do the main footage later.
oh.  so what is the scene about?
uh... you are a very important and respected man.  you are leaving your house... and you are in a hurry to a big social event.
okay.  but what if I am not in too big a hurry?  what if i take a moment to slow down and savor the beauty of life?  to smell a flower?
that is great.  let's do a take.
and, cut...
eddie, how was i?
perfect.
oh, flowers!  i did not know you were so traditional.
i just picked them up on the way over...
they are very nice.  let me get my coat.
so have you always lived in l.a.?
no.  I am from back east.  you know, all-american small town... everybody knew everybody, i was a boy scout, my dad worked for the post office...
sounds like you lived in grovers corners.
did you find it boring?
nah, 'cause i had my comic books. and i read pulp magazines.  and i listened to the radio dramas...
oh.  i loved those shows!  "inner sanctum"... "the shadow" --
yeah!  do not forget "mercury theatre"... and then every saturday, I would go to the little movie theater down the street.  i even started ushering there.
you are not going to believe the first picture i ever saw.  your friend's.
what do you mean?
"dracula."
that is incredible!  you know, i had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie.
i had to sleep with the lights on for a month.  but i never missed a lugosi picture after that.
a few years ago, i actually saw him do "dracula" live.  i thought he was much scarier in person.
kathy, I am about to tell you something I have never told any girl on a first date.  but i think it is important that you know.  i like to wear women's clothes.
huh?
i like to wear women's clothes: panties, brassieres, sweaters, pumps... it is just something i do. and i can not believe I am telling you, but i really like you, and i do not want it getting in the way down the road.
does this mean you do not like sex with girls?
no! i love sex with girls.
oh.  okay.
okay?
no, do not worry, i moved on.  i was just calling to see if you want to attend the world premiere of my new film, "bride of the monster."
did not you just make one called "bride of the atom"?
it is the same film.  but the distributor wanted a punchier title. c'mon!  it is going to be a big event -- we are going all out!  bela, tor, and cris are coming.  you will have fun!
my eyes are killink me.
do not worry.  we are almost there.
eddie, where are we?  we passed that carwash twenty minutes ago.
i predict we are lost.
sorry...
has anyone ever been to downey?
what is happening?
we are escaping!
stop!
stop!
last night was quite a romp.
did you see that kid grab vampira's tits?
i envied him.  hell, i envied you too, having a girlfriend that would jump in front of a car like that.
yeah, she is really somethin'.
i know none of my wives would've.
eddie, i want to thank you.  these last few days have been a good time.
i just wish you coulda seen the movie.
no problem.  i know it by heart...
ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
thanks.  it is actually the only thing i know how to make.  hey, can you grab that strainer?
what was that?
bela died.
I would seen him in a coffin so many times, i expected him to jump out...
ed, you have got to snap out of this. bela's dead -- you're not!
i might as well be.  i made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  i blew it.  all he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
well you tried --
i was a fuckin' hack!  i let people recut the movies, cast their relatives...  i let bela down...
mr. wood?!
hruphh...?
mr. wood, this is mr. reynolds, your landlord.  could you please open up?
yeah...?
mr. wood, you have bounced your third and final rent check.
I am real sorry.  my stockbroker must have transferred the wrong account... c'mon in, I will write you another one.
hmm, so you are in the picture business?
you could say that --
i'm interested in the picture business.  my associates and i wish to produce a series of uplifting religious films, on the apostles. but unfortunately, we do not have enough money.
raising money is tough.
oh!  our church has the money for one film.  we just do not have it for all twelve...
okay -- you know what you do?  you produce a film in a commercially proven genre.  and after it is a hit, you take the profits from that, and make the twelve apostles' movies.
would that work?
absolutely!  you see this script..?
"graverobbers from outer space"! it is money in the bank.
graverobbers from what??
from outer space!  it is science- fiction.  very big with the kids! if you make this picture, you will have enough money to finance a hundred religious films!  and pay my back rent from the profits.
i do not know... this is all a lot to absorb.
it is a guaranteed blockbuster!
um, i understand that this science friction is popular -- but do not the big hits always have big stars?
yeah, well we have got a big star! bela lugosi!!
lugosi??!  did not be pass on?
yes, but I have got the last footage he ever shot!
just, it does not look like very much.
it is plenty!  it is the acorn that will grow a great oak.  I will just find a double to finish his scenes, and we will release it as "bela lugosi's final film"
ed, i got the lugosi lookalikes outside.
great!  bring 'em in!  bunny, i got to run.
too tall... too short...  and this guy does not work at all.
well i was thinkin' like, when bela played "fu manchu."
that was karloff.  paul, you got to try harder.  i do not want this film to be haif-assed. this time, we go for the quality.
you know, when you rewrite a script, it just gets better and better!
do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
the left.  it is more natural.  hey, I have got a scene where the aliens have the ultimate bomb.  what would that be made of?
uh, atomic energy?
no.  they are beyond that!  they are smarter than the humans.  what is more advanced?
dynamite --
no, bigger!  what is the biggest energy??
the sun.
yes!  bingo!  solar energy!  oh that is going to seem so scientific.  this movie's going to be the ultimate ed wood film.  no compromises.
those assholes.
the poor girl's out of a job.
yeah...  i should give her a call.
I am really sorry...
it is terrible.  people will not even return my calls.  it is like i do not exist.
i know what that's like.  anyway, i brought a copy of the script.  you would play the "ghoul's wife."
the ghoul's wife?!  god, i can not believe I am doing this...
you should feel lucky.  ed's the only guy in town who does not pass judgment on people.
hell, if i did, i would not have any friends.
look... would it be possible to make the "ghoul's wife" a little less prominent, so people will not really notice me in the movie?
you do not wanna be noticed?
exactly.  hey, how 'bout this -- what if i do not have any lines?  I will do the part mute!
look, it is dr. tom.  hey, dr. tom!
who is dr. tom?
my chiropractor!
it's uncanny.
what is uncanny?
look at his skull!
...do you accept the lord jesus christ as your savior?
i do.
what are you talking about?!  it is the premise of the movie.  it is even the title, for christ's sake!
mr. wood!
what did you give him all the lines for??  he is unintelligible!
look, lugosi is dead and vampira will not talk.   ihad to give somebody the dialogue.
is not it wonderful?  bela lives!
does not this strike you as a bit morbid?
no, he would have loved it!  bela's returned from the grave -- like dracula.  cue vampira!
and perfect.  cut!
"perfect"?  mr. wood, do you know anything about the art of film production?!
i like to think so.
that cardboard headstone tipped over. this graveyard is obviously phony!
people will not notice.  filmmaking is not about picky details -- it is about the big picture.
oh, you wanna talk about the "big picture"?!  how 'bout that the policemen arrive in the daylight, but now it is suddenly night???
this is our choir director.  he is going to play the young hero.
are you in5ane?  i'm the director! i make the casting decisions around here!
i thought this was a group effort.
nooooo!!!
mr. wood?  what do you think you're doing?!
I am directing.
excuse me, sir...?
yes?
uh, uh, I am a young filmmaker, and a really big fan... and i just wanted to meet you.
my pleasure.  I am orson welles.
oh.  um, I am ed wood!  so, what are you working on now?
eh, the financing just fell through for the third time on "don quixote." so I am trying to finish a promo for something else.  but i can not find the soundtrack --  i think i left it in malta.
i can not believe it.  these sound like my problems!
it is the damn money men.  you never know who is a windbag, and who is got the goods.  and then they all think they're a director...
am not that the truth!  I have even bad producers recut my movies --
ugh, i hate when that happens.
and they always want to cast their buddies -- it does not even matter if they are right for the part!
tell me about it.  I am supposed to do a thriller at universal, and they want charlton heston to play a mexican!
mr. welles, is it all worth it?
it is when it works.  you know the one film of mine i can stand to watch?  "kane."  the studio hated it... but they did not get to touch a frame.  ed, visions are worth fighting for. why spend your life making someone else's dreams?
mr. reynolds!
yes?
we are going to finish this film just the way i want it!  because you can not compromise an artist's vision!
b-but it is our money --
and you are going to make a bundle.  this movie's going to be famous!  but only if you shut up, and let me do it my way!
i can not get it to go up.
ed, you are going to miss your own premiere.
c'mon!  let's just go.
ed, I am so happy for you.
let's get married.
huh?!
right now.  let's drive to vegas!
but it is pouring.  and the car top is stuck!
so?  it is only a five-hour drive. and it will probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  heck, it will probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  i promise.
