you, zack?
yes, sir.
I am byron. nice to meet you.  c'mon. let's go get your luggage.
how was the flight? they take care of you okay? long way from norfolk, is not it?
yes, sir.
listen, kid, i was sorry to hear about your mom. that is pretty rough. i would have returned your call a lot sooner but i was out at sea...
i been calling for four months.
well, that is how long I have been out at sea.
this is it. this is where i live. i suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
great.
I am not finished. I will only be in port one week a month and when I am here you would never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it is not who i am. like i told you on the phone, you I would be better off in that state school back in virginia.
i am not never going back to that school, sir.
you got to kid. let me spell it out for you. this is a whorehouse. and i happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's going to make me change.
i do not care about that. i just am not going back. you do not want me? okay. I will find me another place.
come back here, kid!
what for?
okay, okay. you win.
thank you, sir!
stop calling me 'sir! i am not no officer. my name is byron.
hi, byron.
zack, you little shit! you have not changed a bit!
neither have you, pard!
hey, honey, look at this! my son! is not he beautiful?  you should have called!
you were out at sea! hey, guess what? i graduated. i got my degree.
i thought you quit school. last i heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in brazil.
yeah, i made some money down there, then i talked my way into another college and i did it. i was not magna cum laude but i did okay. you should have seen me in my cap and gown.
why the fuck did not you invite me? i would have come.
ay, palequero. never hochi in the p.i.
wha-chu-say, palequero? short time, long time, only ten dolla.
so what are you doing in seattle?
get ready pard. this one's going to blow you away.
zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you have pulled.
i joined the navy.
you... in the navy?
that is right. I am on my way over to this officer school in port ranier.
why?
to fly jets. to be the fastest motherfucker in the world. you got to come and visit me. I am only a couple hours away.
who gave you this idea?
nobody. it just came to me.
do not be pissed. I am on your side, pard. i just do not want you to do something you will regret. you got to give six years to the navy if you wanna fly... that is six years with the most uptight assholes god put on this earth. officers are not like you and me, man. it is another breed.
you afraid you will have to salute me, chief?
fuck, no! why would i care about something as dumb as that?
i do not know. that is just how it sounded. well, I will see you.
hey, what did you want? a lot of fatherly bullshit? a big pat on the back?
from you, pard? never. thanks for the graduation present.
hey, zackie -- do not go away mad.
now when i say "understand" i want the whole group to say, "yes, sir!" understand?
yes, sir!
louder!
yes, sir!!
i do not believe what I am seeing! where have you been all your lives, at an orgy? listening to mick jagger and bad mouthing your country, I will bet.
stop eyeballing me, boy! you are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. use your peripheral vision! understand?!
yes, sir!
i know why most of you are here. we are not stupid. but before you get to sell what we teach you over at united airlines, you got to give the navy six years of your life, sweet pea. lot of things can happen in six year. another war could come up in six years. if you are too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I am going to find that out. understand?
yes, sir!
hi, son.
how're you doing, sarge?
what did you call me?
pardon?
what did you call me, boy?
i called you sarge.
before that.
i did not call you anything before that.
you said, 'how're you?' i am not a 'ewe,' boy! a ewe is a female sheep, boy! is that what you think i am, boy?
no.
no, sir!
no, sir.
lauder, sweet pea!
no, sir!
do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? is that why you called me a 'ewe'? are you a queer?
no, sir.
where are you from, boy?
oklahoma city, oklahoma.
only two things come out of oklahoma, steers and queers. which one are you, boy? i do not see any horns so you must be a queer.
no, sir.
stop whispering, sweet pea, you are giving me a hard on!
are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
no, sir!
what is your name, boy?
mayo, zack mayo, sir!
how did you slip into this program, mayo? i did not know the navy was so hard up.  you got an injury there, mayo?
not exactly, sir.
where did you get this, mayo? this is really wonder work.
subic bay, sir. in the philippines.
i thought i recognized the work.  be proud of those wings. they are the only ones you are going to leave here with, mayo-naise.
come on, guys. it is five o'clock.
one more minute.
how do you figure that is your bunk?
he said it is up to us and i got here first, did not i?
whatever you say, mayonnaise.
fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your poopie suits!
that foley looks like he is been through a war or two.
I have seen better.
think there is any truth to what he was saying about those girls? is that still going on?
sure it is, sweet pea, but he should have warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'puget dudes.' they will tell you they are wearing a rubber but they have bit a little hole in the end.
you are pretty funny, mayo.
maybe we will be roommates, seeger, and you will find out how funny i really am...
far fucking out! I have been wanting to meet one of the blue angels since i can remember.
lynette, watch your mouth! somebody might overhear.
paula, look at the new poopies.
yeah, i saw 'em. poor guys.
see you in a month when you get liberty!
do not worry. it grows out about an inch by them.
hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
do not lose any sleep over it. i would not mind being the first woman to fly a jet fighter in combat.
great. you can go in my place.
jets.
i hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. which one of you is going with me?
good morning, girls.
ever heard of knocking, mayo?
hey, did you hear? sands and kantrowitz dored last night.  survival of the fittest.
the whole world's a jungle, huh, mayo? dog eat dog down to the last one, right?
you got it, sweet pea.  nice boonies, seeger.
two bucks a buckle, perryman. look at that shine! boonies'll cost you five.
who is got two bucks? it is costing me every penny they pay us just to keep my old lady and my kids in that motel.
hey, man, is the piss-ass money you are making off this worth the risk of getting us all kicked out of here on an honor violation?
i do not notice anyone else complaining.
hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
not if you make it worth my while. how about free boonies for the duration?
you told us it would grow out an inch.
it is grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
that was you guys, huh?
come on. let's go dance.
is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here?
yes, ma'am. four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. but i survived.
hey, what kind of name is pokrifki?
polish. what kind of name is mayo?
italian. my mom was irish. i got her ears. but the rest is all wop.
where are you from, mayo the wop?
everywhere and nowhere, paula the polack.
seriously.
my father is a rear admiral in the seventh fleet.
really?
yeah. we have lived all over the world. katmandu, moscow, nairobi.
really? I have never been out of washington except once when i visited this aunt of mine over to portland. i mean, over at portland. am not it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
you got a girl?
no, and I am not looking for one either.
i hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
not me.
yeah? why are you here?
to meet interesting people, improve myself. you would not believe the losers we got over in port angeles.
do you go to school?
no. i work for national paper. it is a good job. i make eight-twenty-three an hour.  when i get enough money saved, i plan to go on to college.
you been through the dilbert dunker yet?
cake walk. both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so i know i can.
is your brother a flyer?
he was. he died.
vietnam?
yeah.
i had a big brother who died over there, too. he was not no flyer though. he was just your basic marine corps type. i was only twelve when it happened, so i do not remember much about him.
i sure remember tommy.  mind if we talked about something else?
we do not have to talk at all.
think you will make it all the way to getting your wings?
who knows? guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
just think 'i'm going to do it!' program yourself. see yourself making it. it will happen. i know 'cause i just read this article in cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
you are a very pretty girl, paula.
something tells me you have been here before.
now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
you are sure it is okay?
do not worry. I will respect you afterwards.
could you believe those girls!
'nellie's nymphos!'
jesus, that lynette! i rode her hard and put her up wet.
hurry, lynette. it is almost midnight.
i got my foot on the floor.
well, it you are not going to ask, then i will. how was it?
great.
details, pokrif. from what i saw he had an incredible body.
yeah... mmmm...
what did he do? did he do anything that was different?
everything was different.
but in what ways?
how did it go with you guys?
big sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
he ask you out for next weekend?
no, but i told him I would be at the town tavern next saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
i told zack about saturday night, too. the fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. come wednesday, he will be wishing he took my number.
you hope.
he will show. I would bet my paycheck on it.
i know I am late and I am sorry, but mrs. rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
i said, come here!
daddy, i do not want to get into anything with you tonight. I am tired and i...
what are you tired from?
joe!
come over here where i can see you.
i do not know what it is. it could be anything.
but you knew right off what i was talking about, did not you, paula! did you let that boy --
do not you dare ask me that question. I am an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
well, as long as you live in this house, young lady, you live by my rules! you should be dating local boys.
uh-uh! not a chance! there is nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. if i can not have more out of life than that, I would rather be dead!
do you honestly think you will find a boy in that... that officer's school who is serious about marriage?
yes i do!
then you are dumber than i thought! all you will get from their kind is pregnant!
esther, do you think she is using...  ...birth control?
yes, joe.
when did this happen?
a long time ago.
look at foley! can you believe it!
shhhh...
nice, hospitable folks they get around here.  i hope she comes.
she will come, pard. a rich socialite oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
get off my case, mayo. i did not grow up rich.
i think we are making some of the locals jealous.
who cares?  mmmm. now i remember. mayo the wop. gee, I am glad you are here. I have been looking forward to this all week.
me, too.
what would you girls like to do? want to stick around here for a little or... or could i suggest another plan...?
like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
or we could do that yeah.
i vote for the motel.
my kinda group!
god! I have never seen anything like that in my whole life! did you see that guy's nose?
lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. will you do that for me, please.
well, excuse me for livin'!
i should not have done that. i should have walked.
he did not give you much choice.
there is always a choice.
where did you learn to fight like that?
i do not feel like talking, if you do not mind.
opening up just a little would not kill you, ya know.
you want me to fuck you? is that it? okay, come here. take your clothes off. get into bed.
where is that coming from? i would not fuck now if my life depended on it!
forget it. just get out of here.
i do not know who you think you are talking to! i am not some whore you brought here! I have been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
be a friend. leave.
you got no manners and you never tell the truth! you are nothin' special. and if you ask me, you got no chance at all of being an officer!
you stayed after all.
wrong. I have driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty hail mary's since i saw you. hungry?
I am starving.
paula, i never try to fool anybody about who i am, what i want... so if even in the back of your --
i know who you are and what you want.
what do you want, paula? what do you really want?
to have a good time with you until you have to go.
that is it?
zack, i dare you not to fall in love with me. i am not going to get serious with you, no way. but how can you resist me? I am like candy.
you are better than candy.
I am serious. it is going to be hard to get enough.
zack, when you are through with a girl, what do you do? do you say something or do you just... disappear?
I have never had a girl.
i forgot to thank you for breakfast.
any time, sailor.
you okay?
sure.
I will never get it polished in time. give me a buckle, zack.
i can not risk it.
you would make it. he is just getting to the girls. come on, zack. i got to see my family, man. i could not take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
sorry, pard. would not want you to get an honor violation.
i want your d.o.r.
no, sir. you can kick me out, but I am not quitting.
get into your fatigues, mayo. before the weekend's out, you will quit.
she may not make it through the program, but she is got more heart and more character than you will ever have. I have seen your college record. I have never heard of most of those schools. tell me something, mayo. did you buy that degree?
no, sir! it was the hardest thing i ever did, sir! until this.
that is a lie, mayo. you have gone through a lot worse, have not you?
stop eyeballing me, mister! I have looked through your file and done a little checking, and i know it all. i know about your mother. i know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser.  life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! has not it, mayo?
I am doing okay, sir.
no you are not. you are failing the big one, baby, and i do not just mean in here. i mean in life. I have watched you, mayo, and you do not mesh. you grab-ass and joke around but you do not make friends, not the way the others do.
hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at trader jon's...? come on, man. you are about as close to being officer material as me.
sir, this candidate believes he will make a good officer, sir!
no way, mayo. you do not give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. think they would trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? hey, man, i figure you for the kind of guy who would zip off one day in my f-14 and sell it to the cubans.
sir, that is not true! i love my country!
sell it to the air force, mayo!
i want to fly, sir!
that is no reason. everybody wants to fly. my grandmother wants to fly. you going after a job with one of the airlines?
i want to fly jets, sir!
why? because you can do it alone?
no, sir!
what is it, the kicks? is that it?
i do not want to do something anybody can do.
pity you do not have the character.
that is not true, sir! I have changed a lot since I have been here! and I am going to make it, sir!
not a fucking chance, asshole!
mayo, are those your friends?
yes, sir!
maybe there is hope for you yet.
i see you did not dor, mayo.
hey, sid, thanks.
hey, you guys still awake?
yeah.
hey, do you guys ever... feel like you do not belong here...?
yeah. all week long.
what is the matter, sweet pea. foley finally starting to get to you?
naw.
that is not true, is it?
a little.
how about that prick! he told me he was not officer material because he grew up poor like me.
he said he grew up poor?
the kid on the windy side of the baker's window. that is how he put it.
foley's not poor. buddy of mine in oh-four told me he is the son of a rich doctor down in louisiana.
that was great.
it sure was.
want me to get a towel?
I will get it if you want.
i do not want you to move.
i do not want to move. but somebody has to move sometime. eventually.
they found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
you know, sometimes i wish i was one of those girls they are letting in the flight program these days. god, I would love to fly.
what is stopping you?
i do not care what the magazines say... it is just not as easy being a girl, especially from a catholic family. you do not know the junk i grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
that is no excuse for not going after what you want.
who says I am not going after what i want? my mother's thirty-nine years old and she still works in that factory. every time i see her, i know exactly what i do not want.
my old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while i was at school.
god.
the thing that really got to me... she did not leave a note. nothing. I have always hated her for that.
does it still hurt?
naw. you are alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down.
I am sorry. i can not sit with you.
i understand. maybe we will see each other after the show...
who is that?
nobody. just a girl I have been making it with the last couple of weekends.
great ass.
yeah, i sort of thought so myself.
better watch out for that kind, zackie. you know what they call 'em, do not ya?
yeah, i know.
back east in newport, rhode island, they call 'em the fall river debs. in pensacola, the mobile debs. in norfolk --
that what she was... a norfolk deb?
who?  aw shit, zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
what if i want to talk about her, pard? what then? you know, that is all I have ever heard from you, since i was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it is important.
there is nothing to talk about. two goddamn times i made it with your old lady. we barely even talked.
that is not how she told it. she said you wrote her every week you were away.
i wrote. not every week...
she said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
i never said any of that!
i found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
okay, i wrote those things... and yeah, i had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, i saw who she was. I would had quiff lay that shit on me before!
what did you call her? what did i hear you call her, you son of a bitch?
what is the matter?
nothing. go back to the show, paula.
I have seen all that a hundred times.
hey, will you just leave me alone?
come on. invite me. all day the idea of a family sunday dinner's been coming into my head. since you are the only one i know around here with family...
zack, i do not know if i want to do that...
hey, what about sunday dinner? when're you going to let me know?
when I am good and ready.
you serious about having him over?
i have not made up my mind.
paula, how far would you go to catch zack?
what do you mean?
you know what i mean. would you... let yourself get pregnant?
no way... would you?
i never used to think I would do something like that, but now I am not so sure. you ask me, nine weeks just am not long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
that do not justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, lynette! nothing justifies that. i can not believe you are even thinking like that. i mean, that is really backward.
no more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  do not you ever feel used, paula? do not you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
no. i never feel like that.
i do.
hi.
are those for me?
no, they are for your mom.
he does not mean anything by it, zack. do you, joe?
i do not mean anything by it.
I am so embarrassed. i knew i should not have brought you here.
no, it is okay. it was a great free meal. everybody was so uptight i felt sorry for you.
that is okay. I am used to it.
so, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? is that in pensacola?
yeah, then if i get jets, it is on to beeville, texas.
zack, do you ever think about what it would be like to have kids... a family.
no. is that what you want?
some day. when I am sure i can do a better job of it than my folks.
what would you do differently?
for a start, i would not marry a man i was not in love with.
why did your mom marry that guy if she did not love him?
because my real father would not marry her.
your real father?
your real father was an officer candidate like me?
twenty-two years ago.
no wonder he was looking at me like that.
call me during the week if you get the chance.
I will try, but this week we go into survival training, so i can not make any promises.  well, thanks again for dinner. thank your mom again for me, will you?
sure.  zack, i hope you know i did not have to show you that picture.
i know that.
i kid you not, mayo, i am in love. we must have set a new indoor record today. you want to know how many times we did it?
you would better get smart, man. it is time to walk away.
what? you have got to be kidding!
remember what foley said? his little warning? those are the girls he was talking about. they are out to marry us any way they can.
i do not believe that. they are just having a good time, same as us.
that is what they want you to think, but i saw where she lived, what is she is trying to get away from.  just take my word for it, pard. break it off now. do it this week.
sid worley, i think you are ashamed of me.
ashamed? no -- i love you, lynette. i mean that. after i leave them, I will meet you at the motel, okay?
if you will not take me to dinner with your parents, i will not meet you at the motel.
lynette, i told you already, it will not work.
then, I will see you around.
thanks for covering for me.
no problem, but who is susan?
my girl back home. we are supposed to get married after i get my wings. she was tommy's girl. they were engaged to be married before he died.  i should have told you about her. i do not know why i didn't, except i did not want you to think i was a shit for making it with lynette.
I am not your folks, man. you love this... susan?
she is the sweetest person I have ever known. loves kids. works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. everybody loves her.
i did not ask you all that, sweet pea. i asked if you loved her.
listen, I am not going to go to that little reunion party. I am meeting lynette at the motel.  best head in fifty-two states. after three days of survival training, how could i resist?
you should have done what i did. a clean break.
lynette told me it really tore her up when you did not call this week.
zack, we have got to go.
just trying to have fun. that fucking prison is really starting to get to me. c'mon, seeger. gimme a push.  fuck you guys! I will do it myself!
by the way, should not you have had a period by now?
I am a little late, that is all.
how late?
what difference does it make? if anything was to happen, which I am sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
exactly how late are you, lynette?
what do you care? suppose i was pregnant. just suppose it. you do not think I would try to make you do anything you do not want to, do you?
no. but that is not the only issue here, sweetheart. there is a lot more to it than that.
what other issue is there, sid?
my responsibility as its father, for one. i mean, if I have made you pregnant, I would want to... do the right thing.
...i'd want to pay for the abortion... I would want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side.  so how late are you, lynette?
let's just wait and see what happens.
talk to me in the morning. i feel like shit.
but it can not wait.
calm down, sweet pea. she seen a doctor?
no, but she is got to be at least a month late.
does not mean shit. get her to a doctor. you can not do anything until you hear what he says. make the appointment yourself.
go on, zack! go for the record!
fuck the record. now you listen to me and do exactly what i tell you.  start back ten yards and take off from here. not here... or there... but right here!  no excuses, seeger! you are going to plant those legs here and then you are going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! you want jets? then do it, goddamnit!
it is a big religious thing with her and she will not even discuss it.
but she expects you to marry her?
she said it was up to me. if i don't, she will go off and have the baby on her own somewhere.
so what is the problem? girls do that all the time.
i can not let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. if it is my kid, too, then I have got a responsibility, do not i?
not if she will not even talk about an abortion.
but it would still be my kid. that is the point.
do you know that for sure?
it is mine.
okay, but what if it is like foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility?
no matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" zack, there'll be a child in the world that is mine -- and i could not go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
jesus christ, sid! is everything your responsibility?
sid, what happened?
i do not know... i felt like... like i was suffocating... christ, zack... i was so scared... so godddamn scared...
you did not kick him out...? wait, did not he tell you what he is been going through?
it does not matter what he is going through. that is the whole purpose of this zoo. what matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can not ever happen again.
but you do not understand. there is this girl he is gotten pregnant and she is putting him through hell, sir.
he is right, zack. it does not matter.
just like that it is all over? with less than two weeks to go, you are out?
what did you call me, mayo?
zack, don't!
i thought the d.i.'s were supposed to help you in this place! what kind of human being are you?
stop eyeballing me, mayo, or you are out!
please, zack -- go back to the barracks!
i do not get it! he is the best candidate in our class! ask anyone! the best student! the best leader! the best friend to everybody! could not you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
zack, it was not him! he did not ask me to d.o.r. i came to him on my own.  I am glad it is over, zack. i really mean that. he was right. i was not doing this for me.
I am looking for sid.
so?
paula, he dored and nobody's seen him.
why did he do it?
hey! you know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
I am not playing any games! go look at lynette's!
i do not know where that is.
hi, babe. come on. I have got a couple of things i want to tell you.
what are you doing out of uniform, sid? you do not want to get in trouble.
forget that. come on. got a little surprise...
i can not go like this. can not you wait a few minutes 'til I am ready?
no way. I am so happy I am about to bust. here, honey. this is for you. it cost me my whole savings, but i said what the fuck.
sid! oh, it is beautiful! you mean...
that is right. let's get married, lynette. let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
let's go tell paula! god, i wonder where we will be stationed first. i hope it will be hawaii. I have always wanted to go to hawaii.
we are not going to be stationed anywhere, baby. i dored.
you what?
i had to, baby... I am no aviator. i was faking it, like i was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
but... but what would we do? where would we go?
oklahoma. i can get my old job back at jc penney's. in a couple of years, I will be floor manager. oh, you are going to love oklahoma, lynette. you and mama'll get along just great. of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we will make it.
sid, there is no baby.
what?
I am not pregnant. i got my period this morning. there is no baby, sid.
well, I will be goddamned.
lynette, where is sid?
already come and gone. can you believe it? he dored in the twelfth week. how can you win?
what did you tell him about the baby?
that there is not one, as of today. i had my period.  i could not believe it. he still wanted to marry me.
and you turned him down??
of course. i do not want no okie from muscogee. i can get that right here in port angeles.
you little bitch! how could you? was there ever a baby, lynette? that is all i want to know! did you make up that baby, lynette? did you??
of course there was a baby. I would never lie about something like that. would i, paula?
god help you, lynette!
you are no better than me, paula! you are just the same!
no! that is not true!
I would like to come with you.
why?
because he is my friend, too.
please stop it. none of that is true. goddamnit, i love you. i loved you ever since i met you.
come on, paula! you were looking for a ticket out of here and you did not care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! or the class before that!
yeah. you got the whole story just right.
beware of the puget debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
I am not a puget deb. i hate that goddamn term!
i bet you do!
however you got it figured, i did not kill sid and lynette did not kill him! he killed himself!
that is brilliant.
maybe not, but it is the truth. and zack, you did not kill him either.
