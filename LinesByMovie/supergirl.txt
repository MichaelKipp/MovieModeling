what are you making:
it's going to be a tree, i think.
what's a tree?
it's something they have on earth. you know, where your cousin went.
where is earth?
didn't you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
yes, i know the equations---i just can't see it in my head.
even i have trouble with that sometimes. earth is in outer space. and we're in inner space.
i don't understand.
wait till you're older. here -- watch this.
you see, a tree is a living thing.
can you create life?
you and your husband have been kind to me, alura. i have something to tell you: i'm going away. soon.
but where?
i've discovered a new way into the phantom zone.
but the phantom zone is for criminals.
it's big. and empty. i'm tired of limiting myself to  argo city. i want to do something new. i'm starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff....
i'm an artist, alura. my work comes first. other people come second.
how can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? the spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. her look of delight turns to fear. she tries to shoo the creature away. it flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
i'm sorry... i didn't know.
it was my fault. you aren't old enough to use the wand. i shouldn't have given it to you.
but the power source, zaltar.
it couldn't be helped. the city will have to make do with three.
but what will happen?
the guardians will be angry. they may even send me to the phantom zone. you see, i didn't really have permission to borrow it. i must go explain to them...
you sure are a good cook, selena. man, that looks too pretty to eat.
better eat it quick. it won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
selena, i've been thinking. it's time i settled down---and i don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.
why george, are you proposing?
marry me, selena. the hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
george---i thought you'd never ask.
hey, where you going?
i've got things to do.
what about my proposal?
call me next week. maybe we can have lunch.
i am almost an adult. this is what i want.
but kara, no one has ever gone from here to earth. the journey is dangerous.
it was my fault we lost the power source.
years ago. and it was zaltar who stole it.
i allowed it to escape the city.
superman will return it.
why haven't you been able to contact him? he should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. he may be dead. zor-el but what can you, a mere girl-
be brave, my .daughter. be wise.
as brave as my father. as wise.
i don't want much, selena. i have simple tastes.
what do you want?
western europe.
i'm sorry, but i already promised bianca she could have switzerland. you know how she loves to ski.
no problem. she can have it. i hate mountains.
cheer up, nigel. it's not the end of the world.
it may well be. i know how you won that election selena. you can't fool me.
i have plans nigel. you could come with me... i'm going places.
you're not going anywhere. except back to nowheresville. you're too impatient, selena. look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. some of their families have been in the craft for generations. you can't join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
i just did. because i have the power.
you're going to pay a terrible price. the power of shadow is tricky. use it too much and it takes over.
bianca's taught me all! need to know. i'll be safe, as long as i don't go too far.
cigarette?
nigel, get out of here. and don't come slithering back. nigel shakes his head.
you need me, selena. i'm the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
i need you like an eskimo needs a lawnmower. now burn rubber.
balefire on you, selena!
you scorpios can never take a joke.
you think you are on top now. well there is someone coming to challenge you. i saw it in the cards this morning.
throw him out.
is this nigel's doing?
it's a warning, that's for sure.
maybe it was just an accident.
there's no such thing as an accident. everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
don't you believe in knocking?
oh, yes. knocking. the pre-entry signal. i forgot.
what can i do for you?
i'm linda lee.
i mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
here it is. oh...of course. you're the orphan. i'm so sorry about your parents. we'll try to make you happy here.
i can do that.
no sweat. when's the rest of your stuff arriving?
there isn't any.
this is all your clothes?
i have money to buy more, but i haven't had a chance since...
since what?? did you have a fire at your house or something?
i'd rather not talk about it.
you're not...an orphan are you?
my cousin clark is my only relative on earth.
oh wow, i should've known. me and my big mouth. listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. any time.
thank you. you're very kind.
she did that deliberately.
she's a beast.
how'd you do that?
must've been a defective puck.
keep an eye peeled for myra. she's out to get you.
but what for?
she just hates anybody who isn't afraid of her.
i said stop, i didn't say run into a brick wall.
what is it?
the coffer of shadow. look at it.
what does it mean?
the danger. the one nigel spoke of. it must be near .
oh, fiddlesticks. what could be dangerous about a baseball game?
softball.
it must be the girls. one of the girls.
but which one?
drive on. we have already attracted enough attention.
we'll bide our time and keep watch. young girls just can't keep a secret. if one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
and then, like great cats---we pounce! and destroy!
bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you're at the wheel. ok?
sorry, mistress.
your hair looks the same.
it was just a trim.
no thanks. you go on.
you sure?
no plans for the weekend, linda?
no, mr. danvers.
can't have you moping around the campus. why don't you come home with us for dinner?
i'd love to.
is he your entertainment for tonight?
he will be. in about five minutes.
have fun.
finished your estimate?
well, there's several ways to go .
come in, have a drink, we'll talk.
you must be very popular in the neighborhood. i always see your truck parked around.
i have a lot of repeat business. people seem to like my service.
i bet they do.
what's that big black scar on the ground? like a fire.
oh, you know how parties are. always some damage.
what is it?
a passionfruit smoothee.
well, just one.
to us. and to the seeds we'll plant together.
i'll drink to that.
nigel, get lost.
i have to talk to you.
you're wasting your breath.
you used to listen to me. when you asked me to teach you something of the craft.
i could teach you a thing or two now.
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the great mother to protect us... why. are you staring at me like that?
i was just thinking, if i had your skin problems, i'd use a good tannisroot ointment. every night.
nothing's wrong with my skin.
such a shame. you ought to take better care of yourself.
thank you both so much. it was a lovely lunch, mrs. danvers. i had a wonderful time. and you're a terrific chess player mr. danvers.
what? me?
sure. mate in five moves.
linda babes! there's this all-night party at eddie's... his folks are away...
oh, i don't know. i'm not signed out for an overnight.
go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. mccloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
it doesn't seem right.
please, as a favour to me? so i won't  be the only girl?
why is he acting so strangely?
i dunno, but he's gonna get creamed.
lucy; come back!
somebody's gotta do something!!
that was meant for me!
thank you. i'm going to close this up again.
wait...don't leave me in here...
it's for your own protection.
what's happening?
i'm taking you to the hospital.
let me out. i have to talk to you.
later.
i came as quickly as i could. what is the danger?
it's what we were warned about.
a storm dragon?
no, a super girl.
don't leave me.
i have to.
when can i see, you again ?
relax. tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. goodbye.
why did she have to show up now?
eliminate her.
that's easy for you to say, bianca.
you can do it. you're the most powerful woman on earth.
am i? still?
yes! you own the coffer of shadow. nothing can withstand its power.
i've been saving it. for the right moment.
that moment is now! what good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. no one.
what do i do?  i don't know her name.
the naming of names is not necessary. just concentrate on her face. your shadow will do the rest.
next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
i think i'd better keep it.
whatever you say.
yes. whatever i say.  from now on.
nice to meet you. lucy's told me all about you. your cousin clark taught me everything i know about the newspaper business.
nice to meet you.
i'm afraid i have some bad news about your car.
mr. danvers called. i'll get a new one with the insurance money. b.f.d.
do you have any theories about last night?
theories?
how lucy and that guy got to the hospital. and all that damage at the school. the police are calling it a freak tornado. i'd like to interview you for the daily- -
oh, jimmy, can't you forget about your career for one second?
-- planet. i mean, you were there. do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
i believe there's a rational explanation for everything. but i don't know what it is.
can i quote you?
jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
oh, sure.
listen, i know i've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? he's private property. i've been waiting years for him to develop.
he's nice.
nice? he's cute enough to melt lead!
where is your cousin clark, by the way?
he's off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
i knew it ! he's working on a  hot scoop !
oh no, not you again.
what an adorable hat.
they think i have a concussion.
and you think you're in love.
i know it.
this "love" of yours will soon wear off. i gave you a temporary love potion.
why should i believe you?
it's the truth. in twenty-four hours you'll forget all about that girl.
yes, yes i saw the whole thing. how could you be interested in that puny little girl?
but she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
forget her, you're mine. i saw you first.
nurse! nurse!
you can't escape from me that easily. i'm afraid you don't know who i am.
nurse!
don't think i'm weak, just because i'm a woman. i have power. give in, stop fighting me, ethan. i always get what i want.
nurse! help !
this is your problem, right here. this girl's driving you insane, ethan. let me help you.
i don't want your help.
come back to my house. my car's outside.
no!
i never met a man i couldn't have--and you're no different from the rest!
gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
well, lucy, it's nice to see you're feeling better. nice to meet you, jimmy.
you're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
i have to get back. i'm having dinner with the danvers.
again? you're getting real tight with them. you're gonna be a straight-a student---just kidding, thanks for coming.
can i give you a lift?
oh, no thanks.
it's no trouble. i'd like to ask you some more questions.
someone's chasing him.
say---you think that's the same guy who was in the accident with lucy?
yes.
the scoop of the year!
you're alive! she didn't kill you!
who didn't?
that woman who's after me. she hates you. because she knows i love you.
you love me?
my angel. my goddess. i feel i've always loved you all my life. i'll die if i can't spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
we have to have a long talk about all this.
i know just the place. hang a left at the amalgamated tower.
home?
no way. i'm not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
is it her that's bothering you--or your gardener?
this is my favourite place in the city.
are you sure it's all right for us to be here?
they don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre.
like it?
yes. it reminds me of home.
where superman's from? krypton?
no. argo city. it was on a chunk of rock that was part of krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
i'm sorry, i don't understand.
it's not important. the important thing is i'm here to find something and i think you can he1p me.
come on, let's ride.
i used to work here summers when i was a kid.
ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you.
let's talk about us, not her.
tell me where i can find her.
i don't want you to go near her. she's bad news.
but be reasonable. if i don't do something to stop her she'll try again. and maybe hurt you.
i'll be safe with you. we can stay together the rest of our lives.
we can't do that.
why not ?
we're from different worlds.
just give me a chance to show how much i love you. love changes everything. love makes everything possib1e.
all this talk about love, it's silly.
you don't like me? you hate me?
of course i don't hate you. i  don't hate anyone.
what do you feel about me?
there's one sure way to find out how you feel.
what's that?
let me kiss you.
no.
you're not afraid are you?
of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
if we wait until we understand everything we'll be dead. come on. you can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
well...i guess one is all right.
is this how?
terrific.
who are you ?
i am selena. give him to me. now. or you'll both be sorry.
i don't scare that easily.
that ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
a cheap trick.
cheap but effective.
sure glad you didn't let make a monkey of you.
shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
i don't feel like it right now.
she didn't take it from you, did she?
that little girl? ha.  now go on, get me some tools.
there's no need. i learned the craft from my 						grandmother.
i thought i'd show you one of my favourite places.
it's paradise . we could be very happy here.
but i have to go back. i brought you here so you'd be safe. from her.
you can't just abandon me.  alone.
great! i'ii build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. and i'll plant a garden! papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. and i'ii fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
ethan---when i said 'a while' i meant a couple of hours.
you better have a pretty good explanation for this, selena.
we are in great danger. a being has come to earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the craft.
which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
you would! you revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
maybe you'd like to get rid of this supergirl yourself, nigel?
why get rid of her at al1? you've used the coffer of shadow too much.  it is beginning to rule your heart.
nonsense.
she said it wouldn't last.
what wouldn't last? what's the matter with you?
i don't love you any more.
just like that?
like turning off a light.
away. from you.
but why?
because you remind me of all the dumb things i said.
i sort of like what you said.
that makes it worse.
but i don't understand.
at last. ultimate power.
and the first thing we do is get rid of supergirl!
what do you mean we?
hi.
hello. are you still mad at me?
i'm not mad at you.
it seemed that way to me.
i know i was acting funny---i'm sorry. it's just...i miss it.
miss what?
what i had before. what's not there now. it's like i woke up and found part of me wasn't there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. it was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song...
and now?
and now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words don't make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
you think so?
i don't see why not.
but what if---it wasn't real?
feelings are real. once you've had them, they're yours forever.
hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. and maybe something might. happen again. what do you think?
are you asking me for a "date"?
why not? you're a good-looking girl. and i'm--- available.
aren't you forgetting about selena?
she'll forget about us eventually.
there's something very dangerous about her. something evil...
i know what it is. she has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. inside there's a silvery ring...
that's the power source that was lost from argo city! that's what i came: to find! where does she live?
in this big old house on orchard avenue---but you better stay away from there.
i can see through walls. i could surprise her. the only thing i can't see through is lead, that's why i didn't see the power source at the amusement park.
wait. don't leave me.
you'll be safe here. i'll come back as soon as i have the power source.
before you go...
what?
just one kiss. for old times' sake.
and you can see how you feel about me, right?
yes.
i'm wise to your tricks, lady.
i could force you.
if that worked, you would've done it already. no, you want me to drink it of my own free will. well let me tell you, sweetheart, it'll be a cold day in hell before i fall for that one again.
go on,  talk big! i'll soon have you purring like a kitten.
you've been without water for a whole day. let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
you vicious--
careful, don't make me angry. i start fires when i'm angry.
what is this place?
this is the phantom zone. but why did you come here from argo city?
i was on earth...
earth? you crossed the dimension barrier? by yourself?
yes. i went there to find the lost power source...
shouldnt've done that.
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the phantom zone.
it's dangerous to use a power source on earth. it can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
i know.
well, nothing we can do about it. come into my house. you can stay with me, until i build you your own place. i expect you won't want to mix with the others-- not our type of people.
others?
criminals.
...mid pleasures and palaces though i may roam..."
what? palace? hardly.
just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of argo city...
it's lovely. . .
no, no. not lovely. 'perfect'. did everything just right. nobody telling you to change this, move that around. please yourself. that's the secret of happiness.
are you happy, zaltar?
what kind of a question is that? of course: i am. i do whatever i want. all the time.
but what about other people? don't you miss them?
you look at them? how?
the phantom zone overlooks everywhere.. if you have the right tools.
they want me. doesn't it make you proud?
yeah.
that horrible woman!
told you. wouldn't listen to me. knew it would make you sad.
i had to dump the papers in a trashcan. the danvers have been arrested!
how do you know?
i saw them dragged out of the administration building.
did anybody notice you?
i can't help it if men notice me.
lucy! be serious. we could be executed for  treason!
i sure wish superman was around. he wouldn't let any of this go on. not for one minute.
i wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
i heard stories.  i don't think you wanna know.
hey! ethan!
hmmm?
remember me? we were in a disaster together.
a little.
can you get us out? it's all a misunderstanding. we thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
i'll mention it upstairs.
zaltar, please help me.
of course, my dear. what can i do?
help me to get back to earth. where my friends are. they need me.
there's no way out of the zone. no one's ever escaped. that's why they send the criminals here.
if there's a way in, there must be a way out.
no, that's not true---there's well...no--
there is a way.
i knew it!
but it's impossible.
why?
no, it wouldn't work, you couldn't, it's too--- if it didn't work you'd be swept into a singularity--- no, you'd never make it. forget i mentioned it.
then teach me how.
no, it's no good---you can't practice--- you only get one go. a thing like that. no. sure you don't want a sip of this? it's delicious, i think.
takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. just begun to understand it myse1f. give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. besides i can't let you take my wand. only have the one, what would i do? i'd be helpless. it's out of the question.
then come with me.
leave the zone? what would i do on earth?
you could do anything. you could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! you'd have superpowers.
superpowers. got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
please. i have to get back to earth. my friends are in trouble. and unless i bring back the power source, argo city will die.
you're going to take me back?
going to try. didn't say i could.
i heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" she was wrong, zaltar, you have a generous heart.
not doing this for you. just sick of this place, that's all. wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. boring!
hey, i thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
i did.
well thanks a pile, fella.
guess! go on.
i don't know. you seem afraid.
you're a regular einstein, aren't you?
supergirl?
you can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
well...i guess i can't.
i'm ready for her. i'll show you.
why the empty cage?
that one was for you. but i thought i'd wait and see how you behave when supergirl gets here. i'd hate to lose you, ethan.
i've been in love with you for years. remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? and put your fingerprints on my lens.
remember? i was trying desperately to get you're attention.
you were? you mean we could've been... you-know-what... all this time?
you bet your ass.
why didn't you tell me?
you're supposed to guess.
you can use the wand.
better than when i was a child.
what's that? never saw anything like that.
don't stop. keep moving.
yes, mustn't stop.
it's selena. i'm getting so i can recognise her work.
zaltar. use the wand!
too late. too late. save yourself.
goodbye...
zaltar!
you've had your fun, selena, the game is over.
she has hostages.
the danvers. and two of your little friends.
it's just one more crime you'll have to pay for.
you've run out of things to throw, selena.
not yet.
it's her shadow-self! her dark side!
how do i fight it?
turn it against her.
i'm free. i can never thank you enough.
for what?
ever since i found that thing i've been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. you have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
your nightmares are over. i'm taking this back to argo city where it won't be misused.  you could come too. it might be safer for you.
no thanks. i have friends in the resistance. they'll vouch for me. i figure i might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
i'll come back as soon as i can.
she's right. they'll string her up.
do you want to come to argo city?
what's it like?
it's the most beautiful place in the universe.
sounds o.k. to me. let's go.
where is inner space?
it's everywhere. but water is always the door.
they'll be grateful. if you hadn't found it, it would still be lost. look, up ahead.
yes, i see it. shining like a jewel.
that's home.
