what are you making:
it is going to be a tree, i think.
what is a tree?
it is something they have on earth. you know, where your cousin went.
where is earth?
did not you study six-dimensional geometry in school?
yes, i know the equations---i just can not see it in my head.
even i have trouble with that sometimes. earth is in outer space. and we are in inner space.
i do not understand.
wait till you are older. here -- watch this.
you see, a tree is a living thing.
can you create life?
you and your husband have been kind to me, alura. i have something to tell you: I am going away. soon.
but where?
I have discovered a new way into the phantom zone.
but the phantom zone is for criminals.
it is big. and empty. I am tired of limiting myself to  argo city. i want to do something new. I am starting to repeat myself here with this airy, glittery stuff....
I am an artist, alura. my work comes first. other people come second.
how can you create beauty...with a selfish heart? the spiky insect-creature flies closer and closer around the little girl's head, buzzing angrily. her look of delight turns to fear. she tries to shoo the creature away. it flies off toward the thin membrane that encloses the city.
I am sorry... i did not know.
it was my fault. you are not old enough to use the wand. i should not have given it to you.
but the power source, zaltar.
it could not be helped. the city will have to make do with three.
but what will happen?
the guardians will be angry. they may even send me to the phantom zone. you see, i did not really have permission to borrow it. i must go explain to them...
you sure are a good cook, selena. man, that looks too pretty to eat.
better eat it quick. it will not look too pretty when it is all covered with ants.
selena, I have been thinking. it is time i settled down---and i do not know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.
why george, are you proposing?
marry me, selena. the hardware store does not bring in much now, but...
george---i thought you would never ask.
hey, where you going?
I have got things to do.
what about my proposal?
call me next week. maybe we can have lunch.
i am almost an adult. this is what i want.
but kara, no one has ever gone from here to earth. the journey is dangerous.
it was my fault we lost the power source.
years ago. and it was zaltar who stole it.
i allowed it to escape the city.
superman will return it.
why have not you been able to contact him? he should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. he may be dead. zor-el but what can you, a mere girl-
be brave, my .daughter. be wise.
as brave as my father. as wise.
i do not want much, selena. i have simple tastes.
what do you want?
western europe.
I am sorry, but i already promised bianca she could have switzerland. you know how she loves to ski.
no problem. she can have it. i hate mountains.
cheer up, nigel. it is not the end of the world.
it may well be. i know how you won that election selena. you can not fool me.
i have plans nigel. you could come with me... I am going places.
you are not going anywhere. except back to nowheresville. you are too impatient, selena. look around you--all these people have served years and years of apprenticeship. some of their families have been in the craft for generations. you can not join and take over our whole organization in a few months.
i just did. because i have the power.
you are going to pay a terrible price. the power of shadow is tricky. use it too much and it takes over.
bianca's taught me all! need to know. I will be safe, as long as i do not go too far.
cigarette?
nigel, get out of here. and do not come slithering back. nigel shakes his head.
you need me, selena. I am the only one who can save you from a terrible fate.
i need you like an eskimo needs a lawnmower. now burn rubber.
balefire on you, selena!
you scorpios can never take a joke.
you think you are on top now. well there is someone coming to challenge you. i saw it in the cards this morning.
throw him out.
is this nigel's doing?
it is a warning, that is for sure.
maybe it was just an accident.
there is no such thing as an accident. everything has meaning, if you can read the signs.
do not you believe in knocking?
oh, yes. knocking. the pre-entry signal. i forgot.
what can i do for you?
I am linda lee.
i mean, it would probably be there, if you received it.
here it is. oh...of course. you are the orphan. I am so sorry about your parents. we will try to make you happy here.
i can do that.
no sweat. when is the rest of your stuff arriving?
there is not any.
this is all your clothes?
i have money to buy more, but i have not had a chance since...
since what?? did you have a fire at your house or something?
I would rather not talk about it.
you are not...an orphan are you?
my cousin clark is my only relative on earth.
oh wow, i should have known. me and my big mouth. listen, you can borrow any of my clothes you want. any time.
thank you. you are very kind.
she did that deliberately.
she is a beast.
how did you do that?
must have been a defective puck.
keep an eye peeled for myra. she is out to get you.
but what for?
she just hates anybody who is not afraid of her.
i said stop, i did not say run into a brick wall.
what is it?
the coffer of shadow. look at it.
what does it mean?
the danger. the one nigel spoke of. it must be near .
oh, fiddlesticks. what could be dangerous about a baseball game?
softball.
it must be the girls. one of the girls.
but which one?
drive on. we have already attracted enough attention.
we will bide our time and keep watch. young girls just can not keep a secret. if one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
and then, like great cats---we pounce! and destroy!
bianca, try not to be so bloodthirsty when you are at the wheel. ok?
sorry, mistress.
your hair looks the same.
it was just a trim.
no thanks. you go on.
you sure?
no plans for the weekend, linda?
no, mr. danvers.
can not have you moping around the campus. why do not you come home with us for dinner?
I would love to.
is he your entertainment for tonight?
he will be. in about five minutes.
have fun.
finished your estimate?
well, there is several ways to go .
come in, have a drink, we will talk.
you must be very popular in the neighborhood. i always see your truck parked around.
i have a lot of repeat business. people seem to like my service.
i bet they do.
what is that big black scar on the ground? like a fire.
oh, you know how parties are. always some damage.
what is it?
a passionfruit smoothee.
well, just one.
to us. and to the seeds we will plant together.
I will drink to that.
nigel, get lost.
i have to talk to you.
you are wasting your breath.
you used to listen to me. when you asked me to teach you something of the craft.
i could teach you a thing or two now.
...trust the wisdom of the ancients, trust the great mother to protect us... why. are you staring at me like that?
i was just thinking, if i had your skin problems, I would use a good tannisroot ointment. every night.
nothing's wrong with my skin.
such a shame. you ought to take better care of yourself.
thank you both so much. it was a lovely lunch, mrs. danvers. i had a wonderful time. and you are a terrific chess player mr. danvers.
what? me?
sure. mate in five moves.
linda babes! there is this all-night party at eddie's... his folks are away...
oh, i do not know. I am not signed out for an overnight.
go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. mccloskey's always zonked out: she will never hear you.
it does not seem right.
please, as a favour to me? so i will not  be the only girl?
why is he acting so strangely?
i dunno, but he is going to get creamed.
lucy; come back!
somebody is got to do something!!
that was meant for me!
thank you. I am going to close this up again.
wait...don't leave me in here...
it is for your own protection.
what is happening?
I am taking you to the hospital.
let me out. i have to talk to you.
later.
i came as quickly as i could. what is the danger?
it is what we were warned about.
a storm dragon?
no, a super girl.
do not leave me.
i have to.
when can i see, you again ?
relax. tomorrow this will all seem like a bad dream. goodbye.
why did she have to show up now?
eliminate her.
that is easy for you to say, bianca.
you can do it. you are the most powerful woman on earth.
am i? still?
yes! you own the coffer of shadow. nothing can withstand its power.
I have been saving it. for the right moment.
that moment is now! what good is a sword unless it be unsheathed? use it, and no one will dare oppose you again. no one.
what do i do?  i do not know her name.
the naming of names is not necessary. just concentrate on her face. your shadow will do the rest.
next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
i think I would better keep it.
whatever you say.
yes. whatever i say.  from now on.
nice to meet you. lucy's told me all about you. your cousin clark taught me everything i know about the newspaper business.
nice to meet you.
I am afraid i have some bad news about your car.
mr. danvers called. I will get a new one with the insurance money. b.f.d.
do you have any theories about last night?
theories?
how lucy and that guy got to the hospital. and all that damage at the school. the police are calling it a freak tornado. I would like to interview you for the daily- -
oh, jimmy, can not you forget about your career for one second?
-- planet. i mean, you were there. do you think it was natural, or like some people are claiming, supernatural?
i believe there is a rational explanation for everything. but i do not know what it is.
can i quote you?
jimmy, would you please put those poor flowers in water before they die?
oh, sure.
listen, i know I have been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? he is private property. I have been waiting years for him to develop.
he is nice.
nice? he is cute enough to melt lead!
where is your cousin clark, by the way?
he is off doing a top secret uh, investigation.
i knew it ! he is working on a  hot scoop !
oh no, not you again.
what an adorable hat.
they think i have a concussion.
and you think you are in love.
i know it.
this "love" of yours will soon wear off. i gave you a temporary love potion.
why should i believe you?
it is the truth. in twenty-four hours you will forget all about that girl.
yes, yes i saw the whole thing. how could you be interested in that puny little girl?
but she is real, it was not just a concussion.
forget her, you are mine. i saw you first.
nurse! nurse!
you can not escape from me that easily. I am afraid you do not know who i am.
nurse!
do not think I am weak, just because I am a woman. i have power. give in, stop fighting me, ethan. i always get what i want.
nurse! help !
this is your problem, right here. this girl's driving you insane, ethan. let me help you.
i do not want your help.
come back to my house. my car's outside.
no!
i never met a man i could not have--and you are no different from the rest!
gosh, what do you suppose .that is?
well, lucy, it is nice to see you are feeling better. nice to meet you, jimmy.
you are not going to stay for the ice cream?
i have to get back. I am having dinner with the danvers.
again? you are getting real tight with them. you are going to be a straight-a student---just kidding, thanks for coming.
can i give you a lift?
oh, no thanks.
it is no trouble. I would like to ask you some more questions.
someone is chasing him.
say---you think that is the same guy who was in the accident with lucy?
yes.
the scoop of the year!
you are alive! she did not kill you!
who didn't?
that woman who is after me. she hates you. because she knows i love you.
you love me?
my angel. my goddess. i feel I have always loved you all my life. I will die if i can not spend the rest of my life just looking at you, holding you in my arms...
we have to have a long talk about all this.
i know just the place. hang a left at the amalgamated tower.
home?
no way. I am not going to let that little hussy make a monkey out of me.
is it her that is bothering you--or your gardener?
this is my favourite place in the city.
are you sure it is all right for us to be here?
they do not care, they are tearing it down for a shopping centre.
like it?
yes. it reminds me of home.
where superman's from? krypton?
no. argo city. it was on a chunk of rock that was part of krypton once---but we moved it to inner space.
I am sorry, i do not understand.
it is not important. the important thing is I am here to find something and i think you can he1p me.
come on, let's ride.
i used to work here summers when i was a kid.
ethan, tell me more about this woman who is after you.
let's talk about us, not her.
tell me where i can find her.
i do not want you to go near her. she is bad news.
but be reasonable. if i do not do something to stop her she will try again. and maybe hurt you.
I will be safe with you. we can stay together the rest of our lives.
we can not do that.
why not ?
we are from different worlds.
just give me a chance to show how much i love you. love changes everything. love makes everything possib1e.
all this talk about love, it is silly.
you do not like me? you hate me?
of course i do not hate you. i  do not hate anyone.
what do you feel about me?
there is one sure way to find out how you feel.
what is that?
let me kiss you.
no.
you are not afraid are you?
of course not, but...there are things we do not understand.
if we wait until we understand everything we will be dead. come on. you can learn more from one kiss than from years in school.
well...i guess one is all right.
is this how?
terrific.
who are you ?
i am selena. give him to me. now. or you will both be sorry.
i do not scare that easily.
that ought to keep you out of my hair for a while.
a cheap trick.
cheap but effective.
sure glad you did not let make a monkey of you.
shut up, and get me a hacksaw.
i do not feel like it right now.
she did not take it from you, did she?
that little girl? ha.  now go on, get me some tools.
there is no need. i learned the craft from my 						grandmother.
i thought I would show you one of my favourite places.
it is paradise . we could be very happy here.
but i have to go back. i brought you here so you would be safe. from her.
you can not just abandon me.  alone.
great! i'ii build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. and I will plant a garden! papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. and i'ii fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
ethan---when i said 'a while' i meant a couple of hours.
you better have a pretty good explanation for this, selena.
we are in great danger. a being has come to earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the craft.
which of you is willing to make that sacrifice?
you would! you revealed our existence so you could have all of our power.
maybe you would like to get rid of this supergirl yourself, nigel?
why get rid of her at al1? you have used the coffer of shadow too much.  it is beginning to rule your heart.
nonsense.
she said it would not last.
what would not last? what is the matter with you?
i do not love you any more.
just like that?
like turning off a light.
away. from you.
but why?
because you remind me of all the dumb things i said.
i sort of like what you said.
that makes it worse.
but i do not understand.
at last. ultimate power.
and the first thing we do is get rid of supergirl!
what do you mean we?
hi.
hello. are you still mad at me?
I am not mad at you.
it seemed that way to me.
i know i was acting funny---i'm sorry. it is just...i miss it.
miss what?
what i had before. what is not there now. it is like i woke up and found part of me was not there any more: something that made me feel really alive and aware of things. it was like, for the first time in my life, everything fitted together perfectly---you and me and the world around us--like we were a wonderful song...
and now?
and now...the guitars are out of tune, and the words do not make sense, and somebody unplugged the mike...
you think so?
i do not see why not.
but what if---it was not real?
feelings are real. once you have had them, they are yours forever.
hey, listen, when all this blows over, maybe we could get together every now and then and see each other. and maybe something might. happen again. what do you think?
are you asking me for a "date"?
why not? you are a good-looking girl. and i'm--- available.
are not you forgetting about selena?
she will forget about us eventually.
there is something very dangerous about her. something evil...
i know what it is. she has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. inside there is a silvery ring...
that is the power source that was lost from argo city! that is what i came: to find! where does she live?
in this big old house on orchard avenue---but you better stay away from there.
i can see through walls. i could surprise her. the only thing i can not see through is lead, that is why i did not see the power source at the amusement park.
wait. do not leave me.
you will be safe here. I will come back as soon as i have the power source.
before you go...
what?
just one kiss. for old times' sake.
and you can see how you feel about me, right?
yes.
I am wise to your tricks, lady.
i could force you.
if that worked, you would have done it already. no, you want me to drink it of my own free will. well let me tell you, sweetheart, it will be a cold day in hell before i fall for that one again.
go on,  talk big! I will soon have you purring like a kitten.
you have been without water for a whole day. let's see how thirsty you get in a week.
you vicious--
careful, do not make me angry. i start fires when I am angry.
what is this place?
this is the phantom zone. but why did you come here from argo city?
i was on earth...
earth? you crossed the dimension barrier? by yourself?
yes. i went there to find the lost power source...
shouldnt've done that.
...but the person who has it. tricked me, and sent me to the phantom zone.
it is dangerous to use a power source on earth. it can unleash all sorts of terrible forces---
i know.
well, nothing we can do about it. come into my house. you can stay with me, until i build you your own place. i expect you will not want to mix with the others-- not our type of people.
others?
criminals.
...mid pleasures and palaces though i may roam..."
what? palace? hardly.
just feels, a little, like a tiny bit of argo city...
it is lovely. . .
no, no. not lovely. 'perfect'. did everything just right. nobody telling you to change this, move that around. please yourself. that is the secret of happiness.
are you happy, zaltar?
what kind of a question is that? of course: i am. i do whatever i want. all the time.
but what about other people? do not you miss them?
you look at them? how?
the phantom zone overlooks everywhere.. if you have the right tools.
they want me. does not it make you proud?
yeah.
that horrible woman!
told you. would not listen to me. knew it would make you sad.
i had to dump the papers in a trashcan. the danvers have been arrested!
how do you know?
i saw them dragged out of the administration building.
did anybody notice you?
i can not help it if men notice me.
lucy! be serious. we could be executed for  treason!
i sure wish superman was around. he would not let any of this go on. not for one minute.
i wish they would tell us what they are going to do with us.
i heard stories.  i do not think you wanna know.
hey! ethan!
hmmm?
remember me? we were in a disaster together.
a little.
can you get us out? it is all a misunderstanding. we thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
I will mention it upstairs.
zaltar, please help me.
of course, my dear. what can i do?
help me to get back to earth. where my friends are. they need me.
there is no way out of the zone. no one's ever escaped. that is why they send the criminals here.
if there is a way in, there must be a way out.
no, that is not true---there's well...no--
there is a way.
i knew it!
but it is impossible.
why?
no, it would not work, you couldn't, it is too--- if it did not work you would be swept into a singularity--- no, you would never make it. forget i mentioned it.
then teach me how.
no, it is no good---you can not practice--- you only get one go. a thing like that. no. sure you do not want a sip of this? it is delicious, i think.
takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. just begun to understand it myse1f. give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. besides i can not let you take my wand. only have the one, what would i do? I would be helpless. it is out of the question.
then come with me.
leave the zone? what would i do on earth?
you could do anything. you could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! you would have superpowers.
superpowers. got you in a lot of trouble, did not they?
please. i have to get back to earth. my friends are in trouble. and unless i bring back the power source, argo city will die.
you are going to take me back?
going to try. did not say i could.
i heard my mother ask you once "how could a man with such a selfish heart create beauty?" she was wrong, zaltar, you have a generous heart.
not doing this for you. just sick of this place, that is all. wretched singing sculptures, always yowling at you. boring!
hey, i thought you were gonna mention us upstairs.
i did.
well thanks a pile, fella.
guess! go on.
i do not know. you seem afraid.
you are a regular einstein, are not you?
supergirl?
you can not put her out of your mind, is that it?
well...i guess i can't.
I am ready for her. I will show you.
why the empty cage?
that one was for you. but i thought I would wait and see how you behave when supergirl gets here. I would hate to lose you, ethan.
I have been in love with you for years. remember how you used to visit your sister in the newsroom? and put your fingerprints on my lens.
remember? i was trying desperately to get you are attention.
you were? you mean we could have been... you-know-what... all this time?
you bet your ass.
why did not you tell me?
you are supposed to guess.
you can use the wand.
better than when i was a child.
what is that? never saw anything like that.
do not stop. keep moving.
yes, must not stop.
it is selena. I am getting so i can recognise her work.
zaltar. use the wand!
too late. too late. save yourself.
goodbye...
zaltar!
you have had your fun, selena, the game is over.
she has hostages.
the danvers. and two of your little friends.
it is just one more crime you will have to pay for.
you have run out of things to throw, selena.
not yet.
it is her shadow-self! her dark side!
how do i fight it?
turn it against her.
I am free. i can never thank you enough.
for what?
ever since i found that thing I have been like a prisoner in a terrible nightmare. you have no idea how awful it is to be mean all the time.
your nightmares are over. I am taking this back to argo city where it will not be misused.  you could come too. it might be safer for you.
no thanks. i have friends in the resistance. they will vouch for me. i figure i might get a million bucks for my memoirs.
I will come back as soon as i can.
she is right. they will string her up.
do you want to come to argo city?
what is it like?
it is the most beautiful place in the universe.
sounds o.k. to me. let's go.
where is inner space?
it is everywhere. but water is always the door.
they will be grateful. if you had not found it, it would still be lost. look, up ahead.
yes, i see it. shining like a jewel.
that is home.
