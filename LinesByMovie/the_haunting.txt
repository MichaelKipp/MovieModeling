it is still an electric shock!
come on malcolm, it is only seven ohms, it is nothing, it is like a joy buzzer!  and it is not about the pain, it is about the interference with concentration...
malcolm, this is essential work I am doing.  just think what my research can do for education. elementary school classrooms near train tracks or airports, where loud noise is random; this helps to prove the need for sound insulation if the children are ever going to learn to read.
and that will be a good place to end this study.
no, malcolm!  individual performance is only part of it.  i know why baseball players choke for no reason, i know why violinists throw up with fear before every concert, and need to, to give a great performance, but what i want to know is, how fear works in a group...
not the way you have constructed your group, it is just not ethical!
but if the group knows it is being studied as a group, you contaminate the results.  the deception is minor.
are you working with her?
mary, I will meet you outside.
why are you working with her? mary lambretta was thrown out of the department for trying to get a ph.d. in psychic studies.
and after she was thrown out, she needed a job.
you do not believe in the paranormal.
no, but she does, and that is all that matters.
does she know that is why you are using her?
no.
i, i just can't...
she needed a job, malcolm.  and she is smart.  and she helps me.
i have a bad feeling about what you are doing.
this is the last chapter.  please, please give me clearance.  it is for science.
you know what he is really upset about?
what?
you are going to publish, he is going to perish... and why did you hire me for this?
you hear the vibrations in the wire.  there is a magnetic pulse in the wires, you feel it.  i could test it.
test it.
yes, this is doctor marrow.
how did i know it was for you?
because it is my phone.  yes... mrs. dudley, just leave the boxes inside, thank you.  see you soon.  thank you.
here's how they are organized. groups of five, very different personalities: scored all over the kiersey temperament sorter just like you asked for.  and they all score high on the insomnia charts.
good.
what is this?  what is this... this picture?
that?  that is hill house.
this is where we are going?
yes.  it is perfect, is not it?
what do you want?
oh!  you scared me.
me?  no.  what are you doing here?
are you mister dudley, the caretaker?
yeah, I am mister dudley, the caretaker.  what are you doing here?
I am with dr. marrow's group.  I am supposed to check in with mrs. dudley up at the house.  is she here?
why do you need a chain like that?
that is a good question.  what is it about fences?  sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  why would that be?
is there something about the house?
mrs. dudley'll be waiting for you.
it is make the soup or answer the door.  can not do both.
mrs. dudley.
so far.
they are so beautiful.  are not they?
I have seen 'em.  lot to dust.
well, I have never lived with beauty.  you must love working here.
it is a job.  i keep banker's hours.  i set dinner on the dining room sideboard at six.  you can serve yourselves.  breakfast is ready at nine.  i do not wait on people.  i do not stay after dinner.  not after it begins to get dark.  i leave before dark comes.  we live in town.  nine miles.  so there will not be anyone around if you need help.  we could not even hear you, in the night.
why would we --
-- no one could.  no one lives any nearer than town.  no one will come any nearer than that.  in the night.  in the dark.
and what you are wearing, that is great, too.
this?  it is from a thrift shop.
what did it cost?
fifteen dollars.
that would be seventy in new york. you stole it!
it is all i could afford.
wait.  you are not wearing that ironically?  this is really you?
i do not know what you mean.
no one could.  no one lives any nearer than town.
no one will come any nearer than that.
do not worry, i probably will not be in here much.  light sleeper.
that is why we are here.
what do you do?
I am between jobs right now.  my last job... it... the person i was working for... the job ended. over.  so... and you?
that depends.
not really.
do not tell me boston is different from new york.
ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
my boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  if we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  it is hard to be miss perversity when you are the only one at the party.  d'you know what i mean?
no.
a blank canvas!  i could paint your portrait, directly on you. or maybe not.  so, you?  husbands? boyfriends?  girlfriends?  where do you live?
i do not have anyone.  but i do have a little apartment of my own.  it has a little flower garden.  you can just see the ocean.  at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the buoys in the harbor.
jeez.
i know.
i love this house.  i really love this house.
you are okay.
hi, luke sanderson, bad sleeper, I am your basic tosser-turner, and you are...
uh... nell vance...
and what kind of sleeper?
well, i... uh...
obsessive worrier.  join the club.  and you?  I would guess...
hi.  I am todd aubochon.
greetings fellow insomniac.
greetings fellow sheep counter.
and this is my assistant, mary lambretta.
greetings.
eleanor, how was the drive?
you can call me nell, dr. marrow.
nell.  good enough.  and I am jim.
I am really... honored to be part of this study, jim.
well... we are glad to have you.
have either of you seen david watts?
no, but nell's been here longer than i have.
i only saw theo drive up.
who is watts?
these old victorian houses are great, are not they?
it is not victorian, everyone thinks that the whole nineteenth century was victorian.  this is gothic, this is english craftsman, this is romanesque.  this is... insane.  who lives here?
you know what i love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
what?
every year is a good year.
the rest of you may hate your insomnia, but i find it the best time of the day for me.  I am alone.  nobody's talking to me but myself.  my mind is racing with ideas, and i can think.
nah, you are going crazy with doubt, all of your mistakes are coming back up the pipes, and it is worse than a nightmare. --
you wrote that you had trouble sleeping.
yes, because someone was always keeping me awake.  ever since i was little.  that was my job.  i took care of my mother and i had to be there for her all night long, and she woke up all the time.  and after she died, well, it is been a few months, but i still, i still wake up, it's... a habit.  i know we have only known each other a couple of hours, but I am really glad to be with people who let me talk about this.  I am really happy to be here with you.
so why did you need the addam's family mansion for a scientific test?
i thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and i wanted to make sure that it was not so pleasant you would all sleep too easily.  you will be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you have got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
when do we take the tests?
every day.  basically we will be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
all the carvings.
but there is a sad catch to the story.
what happened?
there were no children.  rene died, and then hugh crain built all of this, and then he died. his heart was broken.
that could have been worse.
yeah.
luke, can i talk to you?
sure.
because... well, i know i can trust you.
why?
I have read your tests.
he said that hugh crain... hugh crain was a monster.  he said that he was a brutal, horrible man.  he told me that crain drove his workers to early deaths.  crain had children chained to the looms in his mill.  and listen to this: his beautiful rene killed herself.
and why did not marrow tell us? does not he trust women?  that fuck.
a monster?  but he built this for the woman he loved, like the taj mahal.
the taj mahal was not a palace, it was a tomb.  why did not he tell us?
you have been out of the world for a long time, have not you?
yes.  I have missed it.
no.  the world has missed you.
good night, theo.
you, too.  happy tossing and turning.
hey!  i heard screaming...
luke.
do you need me anymore?  cause I am going to bed.  they can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but i got to try to get some sleep.
go ahead.
if this was some sort of joke, I am going to kill him.
you know it was not a joke, theo.
the cold sensation.  who felt it first?
theo i think.  you have asked us that three times, doctor marrow. what is going on?
how do you feel about luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing?  water hammer, something like that?
sorry.
for an american you do a good imitation of the british at their most apologetic.  pardon me.  excuse me, sorry, sorry...
well this is a cozy breakfast.
good morning, theo.  luke.
yes.  i feel realy rested, too. theo?
i guess.  oh, your hair!  it looks good.
the children.  the children hugh crain built the house for.  the children he never had.
come on.  these are the typically sentimental gestures of a depraved industrialist.
could not get the last ones.  you?
i did okay.
maybe they are mary's.
mary came with me.
and those are luke's and mine.
there is a carriage house around back.
well, this lot is full!
he must have left.  did not like the looks of the place or something.
how could he have left without his keys?
two sets.  i do not know.  maybe they are not even his.
watts?
what is his first name?
david.
david?  david watts?  can you hear us?  david!  daviiiiid!
david?
maybe he never came in.  if he would come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right?  or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell.  maybe he is outside.
is it over?
no, it is getting worse.
nell!  what is wrong?
that smell... oh, god.
what did it smell like?
it was very specific.
all right...
in the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table.  it smelled like that wood.
so... smell... is... smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  and a memory can trigger a smell.
i was not thinking about my mother's bathroom.
what happened after you smelled it?
i looked at theo.  she had a look on her face.
like she smelled it too?
yes.
and then what happened?
i got more scared.
hmm.
I am sorry.  I am messing up the study.
no you are not.  something moved you.  you saw something.
welcome home eleanor.  welcome home?  I have never been here.  who did this?
it is somebody is idea of a joke.
i did not do it.
you could have.
so could you!  is this some fucked up idea of art, putting someone else's name to a painting?
no.
theo... did you?
maybe you did it yourself.
why?
i do not know.  you have been alone for a long time, maybe you want attention.  maybe he did it...
are you coming to confess?
i wish i were.  i wish i had done it, then i could confess and you would be at peace.  that great moral philosopher frank sinatra once said to someone he loved, i wish you had an enemy, so i could beat him up.
let's say it was not you.  who did it?
i do not know.
it was a stupid thing to do.
it was.
welcome home.
you will never see it again.  mr. dudley's taking care of it.  I am sorry, nell.  can i show you something you would like to see?
sure.
that is where she hanged herself.
who?
rene crain.  up there.  rope. ship's hawser.  hard to tie. do not know how she got it.
why?
why did she kill herself?
yes.
she was unhappy.
why?
can not say.  have not been here that long.  well, it is labor day, got to get to work.
someone is playing with you.
why?
i do not know.
it does not matter.  even if they are tormenting me, someone wants me.  what i do with this is up to me.  i can be a victim, or i can be a volunteer.  and i want to be the volunteer.
what is that tune?
i do not know.  a lullaby i guess. my mother used to hum it to me. and her mother before that, and so on.  hugh crain, would you care to dance?
that is so sad.
there is hundreds of them.  this must be a record of the children who died at the mills, like luke said.
before he painted your name over mister crain.
well, it was not me.  mister dudley had to clean it and he knows that he is in charge of all the messes so why would he make more work for himself and...  you said the good doctor was with you.
i do not know what to think anymore.
just think about one thing right now: what color?
I have never had a pedicure before.
well?
red.  what else?
I am sorry i was mad at you, theo.
me too.  although i learned one thing about you, that you do not know about yourself.  you can be a pretty decent bitch.
I will take that as a compliment.  in the city, what kind of place do you live in?
i have a loft.
you want to move to new york, you want to move in with me?
i do not know, you know...
my place is not like yours, nell, it does not have a view of sea.  it does not have a view of anything. what is interesting about the way i live is what goes on inside the walls.  living with me... my boundaries are not very well defined, nell.  do you know what i mean?
I am trying.  have you ever kept something to yourself because you were afraid it would ruin things.
are you sure?
i think so.
okay.
marrow said the same thing as last night, he says --  -- that he checked with mrs. dudley.  and he says that she told him that all the fireplaces in the west wing connect to the main chimney.  he says that he thinks that the flue was open, and with the windstorm, he says that what probably happened was some kind of freak air current --
-- what do you think?
mister very talky, would you please say what it is about this study that bothers you?
the whole thing feels like experimental misdirection.  like he says it is about one thing, a psychological profile of environmental effects on insomnia... and that would be a legitimate study, but i think that we have been subjected to an academic bait and switch; he is really looking at something else.
then who is?  come on, nell.  deep down, if you really thought it was not jim, why would not you be leaving right this second?  why would not you be afraid?  really afraid.
because i do not want to ruin things.  because home is where the heart is.
get a blanket!
it is okay... we are all here...
nell, what happened?
carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
nell... please, nell... take a deep breath...
and they are all locked together in here... and he will not let go of them!
modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations.  you brought us here to scare us.  insomnia, that was just a decoy issue.  you are disgusting.
is this true?  I have been hypnotized?
i had not done a study of how group fear affects individual performance.  mass hysteria is like a story, nell.  a communal story.  someone starts it.  then we all add a little more to it. and then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it.  this story shapes what we see and hear.  we interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. i started our story when i gave you the history of hill house. you have added to it.  that is what this experiment has all been about.  that is what it was about, the experiment's over.  I am pulling the plug.  this is my fault.
it is not real?  crain?  he is not real?
your fear of him was real.  that is all the ghost anyone needs.
how could you do this to people?
this is real, I am not making it up!  theo, you saw it!  you were there -- the banging and last night.  you, you all saw the painting!
nell, it makes sense.  it all makes sense.  you and i, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
-- but the painting!
why would we want to do that, nell?
because that is where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills!  because that is where their bones are!  he killed <i>hundreds</i>.  he took them here and he killed them.  their bones are in the fireplace!
I am going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  and then I am going to get some brandy.
i do not think i want any.
i do.
i gave my key to the gate to todd, but the dudleys'll be here in the morning.
do we still get paid for the week?
you get your money.
is that the question of compassion or science?
it is a question.
she got the child labor stuff from me.
is she asleep?
yes.  but i promised i would not let her alone the whole night.
we are fucked.  we are in a haunted house and we can not get out until the morning.
you do not really believe it is haunted... do you believe in ghosts?
that depends on your definition of ghosts.  I am going to check on her, and then I am going to stay awake.
all night?
yeah.
you want company?
maybe someday.
it is not going to hold your weight.
just stay there, nell!
the children want me.  they are calling me.  they need me.
nell.  you will come here now.
she needs help.
I will take her with me to the university tomorrow.  i can not believe i read the test wrong.  i did not see anything that looked like she was suicidal.
you used the wrong test.
will the two of you shut up!  god damn it!  maybe the tests were right, marrow.  she is sensitive, she is vulnerable, but i do not think she is suicidal and i did not have to test her.  maybe she was not trying to kill herself. maybe she was really scared. maybe she really heard voices.
you are not telling us something.
watts.  those were his keys nell found.  his roommate called and said watts left when he was supposed to.  i think he is here.
he is wandering around the house, and nell heard him.  she thought it was ghosts.  let's go look for him again.
no.  if he is lost somewhere in the house... he will have to stay lost until tomorrow, until the night is over.  what we have to do now is be together, with nell.
they are all in here.  all the ones he killed.  they are just children! we have to help them!
come on!  why are we waiting?
but you told me to look in the paper!  you told me I would be perfect!
nell, the first time i ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
then who called me?
nell --
-- how much is this car worth?
was sure she would be in here.
where in the hell can she be.
nell!
we can not stay here looking for her.  she does not want to be found...
what did you come back for, babe?
just had to be sure.
oh, theo.  you know i do not have an apartment.
then let's go get you one.
no.
my mother used to hum this to me. like her mother hummed it to her. and my great grandmother carolyn hummed it to her.
come on.
no --
what will happen to us, nell?
nothing, if you leave right now. there is a war going on all around us.  do not get in the way, please.
oh god, we can not get out!
nell, what do we do?
I am not going back to new york city.  I am going to find an apartment with a little flower garden, where you can just see the ocean and at night, when the wind comes in just right, you can hear the sound of the harbor.  what about you?
I am a scientist.  i just conducted an experiment.  now i have to write it up.
but the experiment was a failure.
