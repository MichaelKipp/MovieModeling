turn on the flashlight.
I am trying.    it does not work.
do they come with batteries?
you did not buy batteries?
i thought they came with batteries.
i can not believe you did not check.
i bought everything you put on the list. gloves. pen knives. flashlight. batteries were not on the list.
why should i have to put it on the list? it is like saying to buy a car with tires.
you know what makes a good get away driver?  being able to get away!
you are always pointing out my negative qualities. my analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
a black panther was a member of an african american militant group in the sixties, marcel. i think you are referring to the pink panther.
pink panther, black panther. who gives a shit? and i do not remember asking you a god damn thing, you little turd.
there is no reason to be abusive. you are projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.
what the hell is he talking about?
I am talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
how about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
where is your brother?
vincent's in the states on business.  that it?
hey daniel! hello?  do you guys speak english?
uh, yeah.
good.   i have a job for you in america.
besides, we do not know the city and--
mr. bastaldi is not asking you if you want to go. he is telling you you are going! and if he is telling you you are going to be going then you are going to go!
thank you marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.
c'mon, laurant, america?
the job is worth about two million euros. pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, daniel. you leave tomorrow.
going somewhere?
oh, marcel! i thought you were somebody else. if i knew it was you i would have never run.
today's your lucky day, sami.
yeah, i can see that.
normally I would be breaking your fingers right now, but I am going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. we have a group going to chicago to do a job. you are going with them.
me?
you lived there. you know the city.
I have still got a few legal problems back in the states.
I am sami.    marcel sent me.
what is it you do, sami?
you know, a little of this, a little of that. I have boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. right now I am into pick-pocketing.
i see.   a master criminal.
hey, i was told to come here by marcel. you guys do not want me, I will be more than happy to leave.
this is zero.
hi. I am one and this is two, three, four and five.
in english.   sami does not speak french.
where are you from?
algeria.
and you do not speak french?
well, you know, not all algerians speak french. it is a matter of what school you went too. me i never really --
-- zero is not interested in your life story.  who gets killed?
hopefully no one.
no one? then why is zero here?
he speaks about himself in the third person?
feel free to correct him if you want.
i just want you there in case there is trouble.
and if there is, then zero can kill someone?
we will see.
i thought i would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that marcel will be going with you.
what?
this is a considerable move up for you, daniel. the temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.
you do not trust me?
i do not trust anyone. you do not get to the top of this game by trusting people... and after all, you are a thief. it is in your nature to steal. I am just protecting my investment.
he said to go fuck yourself.
we are tired and bored with your bullshit. so, put that stupid little knife away before zero shoves it up your ass.
you put a loaded gun in your bag and brought it through customs? how stupid is that?
zero did not put it in his bag.    he put it in yours.
i was not expecting this many of you. I have got a few sleeping bags you can use.
thanks.
i am raymond.     thank you for allowing us to stay here.
no problem, man.  hey, you wanna hit?
no thank you.
oh, pepe le pew. he is very funny and quite well known in france.
yeah, i dig him.
although a cartoon i feel he shares a universal theme: we are all searching for love. no?
they do not have a wine list.
oh, then we will have the house wine.
they do not serve wine here.
what kind of restaurant does not serve wine?
this kind.
okay.    i will have a beer.
what did i tell you? huh, vinny? what did i tell you when you came to me for money? did not i ask you not to do it? did i not say that?  what did i say to him?
you said do not do it, boss.
that is right. i said do not do it. did you listen to me? no. you wanted the money. so, i lent you twenty large. now it is been three weeks and you am not paid a dime. what do you think that makes me look like on the street? i do not do something to you and everyone will think they can skate.
frankie, i --
-- shut up! do not you try to make me feel bad about this. you knew what would happen to you if you did not pay. this is on your head, not mine.  break his arm.
jesus, frankie, I am your brother!
that is why we are only breaking one arm.
there is an exterior alarm system. there is also another one in the hall that leads to the bedroom with a motion detector. the control panel is in the bedroom.
i can handle the exterior alarm, but the one in the bedroom is a problem.
after the outside alarm is off we go in through the bedroom window.
good. zero and julien will go in through the window and disable the motion detector. the rest of us will come in through the front door.
what about transportation?
you can use my car.
not a good idea. someone gets a license number and it all leads back to you. raymond, you will steal one.
no problem.
when do we go?
tonight.
tonight?
i know they will not be home tonight.
you ever hear of jet lag?
take a nap.
i can not even hear myself think.
how are we supposed to sleep with this noise?
good. I am doing good. how you doin', frankie?
good.   I am good.
mr. maranzano sends his warmest regards.
when you return please extend my regards to mr. maranzano and his family.
can i offer you something.    a drink? coffee?
no thank you.
you sure? i just got a shipment of espresso from sicily. special blend. can not find anything like it in the states.
I am good.   really.
okay. i understand you are interested in one of our properties?
yeah. that warehouse over on merchant street. the volume on our import business has risen dramatically. the proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the --
-- super what?
supernumerary. it means better than expected.
then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? everybody knows what better than expected means.
I am taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills.
okay.   how much?
I am not here to negotiate.
why are you here?
to tell you that we are interested in the property.
you told me that on the phone. what the hell are you doing here? showing off your communication skills? go back to your people and tell them when they are serious to put a number on the table.
i will relay the particulars of our conversation to mr. maranzano.
yeah -- you do that.
how is my brother?
he is over at st. james. they had to put two pins in his arm.
i said a clean break.
hey boss, it is not a science.
send some flowers. something nice. roses or carnations. and one of those get well soon cards.
you like shoes?
no, i like the bag. it would be good for the job tonight.
it belongs to vincent bastaldi. he left it last time he was here. I am sure he would not mind if you used it.
so, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
just lucky i guess. how did you start working for the bastaldi's?
the art world does not fully appreciate my talent yet. i needed some way to pay the rent. laurant and vincent pay well for information.
so you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
they are not nice people.
casandra. old girlfriend?
something like that.
did she break your heart?
something like that.
it looks old.     did you get it a long time ago?
you ask a lot of questions.
that is how you get to know someone.       did it hurt when you got it?
i do not remember.    i was drunk.
you got it in a bar?
no. i got it in prison. i went in for three years. when i came out she was married to my best friend. happy?
sorry.   i did not mean to pry.
it is okay.   it was a long time ago.
I have been thinking about getting tattoo. you know, a flower or something. on my ass.
who is going to see it there?
the lucky ones.
I am glad you did not get something flashy.
watch this.
maybe you should call the police.
hey, idiot -- I have got stolen wheels and a stolen radio in the car.
i just thought that--
-- do not think. okay?        you are not good at it.
i think we went the wrong way.
oh, you think?
the map said to go left.
yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
oh yeah.
frankie, come in. good to see you.      you want something?
no, I am good, angelo.
i understand bobby beans came to see you today.
yeah. seems maranzano wants to talk about buying the merchant street warehouse.
and?
and nothing.     he is just feeling us out.
he is trying to get a foot hold in our territory.
he sticks his toes in the water again, we will cut 'em off.
business must be good if he can afford to buy up useless property.
i heard this quarter his profits are gonna be supernumerary.
they are going to be what?
supernumerary. it means better than expected.
good word.
someone else coming?
nah, that is just tony's way of telling me judge judy starts in ten minutes. you ever watch it?
uh, no --
you should. you can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. very informative. stay and watch it with me.
you know, I am kind of tired. I am just going to go home if it is all the same to you.
oh frankie, what is this i hear about your brother?
he missed three weeks.
your own brother? you could not send someone else to do it?
i did. joey "two tons" and nicky "the rake" did the deed.
but you were there?
angelo, we live and die by the rules we make. we are men of honor, but honor without respect is a... horse-less carriage.
we have got to be careful not to use our real names while we are in here.
good idea.
I will be elvis and you--
-- i want to be elvis.
it is my idea.
c'mon, i look more like elvis than you do.
okay.   you can be elvis.
there has to be.
I am telling you I have pulled out everything in the safe. there are not any jewels.
there must be half a million dollars here though.
we have a problem. problem is not the right word. dilemma. no that really does not describe --  do you know who that is?
mr. taylor?
no, that is not mr. taylor.
it is not?
that is frankie zammito.   the under boss of the chicago mafia.
why would they want us to rob the mafia?

hello?
it is elvis...
who?
it is me...
marcel?
yes. we went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some mafia guy.
you are there now?
oui.
you are calling me on your cell phone, right?
no.
you are calling me on is phone?
oui.
my number's going to show up on his bill!
should i call you back?
you have already robbed the safe?
oui.
take what you have got and get out of there.
you think it is smart to tell him we are french?
i think he is already figured that out.
we are being watched. daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
cops?
what do we do?
i was told to take what we have and go.
go where?   the police are outside.
i do not know.     maybe if we did just leave --
c'mon, get real, will you. you think he is just going to forget about this? these guys are all about respect. all about honor. he is coming after us, so we might as well take the money.
how did it go? i do not know.     daniel, how would you say it went?
i would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. you gave us the wrong address sophie.
no, i didn't.
bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
yes.
and he gave it to us.    145 ridgeway road.
no.    145 ridgeroad way.
that moron.
it was an honest mistake. ridgeway... ridgeroad... ridgeway road.
everyone get some sleep.    we are leaving in the morning.
-- you stole my cousin enrique's car.
hector, do not interrupt me.
he told enrique he did not know anything about his car.
i do not give a shit about your cousin's car. we are here about my car. so, shut your mouth! you think you can do that? you think you can keep your big mouth shut?
they were all french guys.
french guys?    you mean like from france?
yeah, french guys from france.
what did they take?
everything.
everything?
everything.
boy, you must be pissed.
well, you know, when five guys break into my house in the middle of the night, stick guns in my face, tie me up and steal from me... it does irritate me.
well, i must say you are handling it very well.
you know why I am handling it very well? because you are going to get these guys for me.
okay boss.   where are they?
if i knew where they were you would not have to find them, would you?
you did not say find them. you said, "get them."
just find them!
okay boss.
can not sleep?
no.
I am sorry things went so wrong today.
it is not your fault.
what are you doing?
i thought I would listen to some of the tapes. see what is so important that a mob guy has to lock it away in his safe.
sounds boring.
it is three in the morning.    not much else to do.
oh, man... this is bullshit!    you can not trust anyone these days.
she took everything!    did not even leave us cab fare.
what is the big deal? it is not like i was on guard duty or something.
you did not think it was little suspicious that someone you only knew for a few hours wanted to sleep with you?
no.   chicks dig me.
holy shit.
what?
no wonder zammito did not want us to walk out with this stuff. he is planning on killing bonanno and taking over the family.
this was not the deal! the deal was to steal a necklace, not get in the middle of a mafia war.
the deal is whatever mr. bastaldi says it is.
you know, if you could get your nose out of bastaldi's ass for two seconds you might see what is going on around you.
i knew this was a mistake! i knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. i could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! do not you do it!" jesus, why do not i ever listen to myself?
yeah, but you did do it.   so let's deal with that.
yeah.   we just go home.
we can't.
i agree with marcel. i say we go to the airport and get on a plane.
they will be waiting for us at the airport.
you steal some money from a man he gets over it in time. but these tapes. he is never going to stop looking for us.
we have to find sophie.
how are we going to do that?
i know where she went.
tell me the truth hector... do you think we will find my car?
hard to say.
how do we know what room she is in?
wait here.
i really thought we had something special going. i can not tell you what a disappointment you have turned out to be.
after last night i could say the same for you.
the money is not here.
where is it, sophie?
i do not know.
if you think because you are a women this can not go hard on you, think again.
who are you waiting for?
stick around and find out.
they send us to zammito's house. the fbi is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they do not move. a crime is going down and they do not move. why?  because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.
what does arresting us get them?
you wanna tell him?
why?
vincent bastaldi is in jail.
for what?
laurant and vincent were in business with zammito.
what kind of business?
black market art. zammito got to a few key security guards at the metropolitan museum. the bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. they would switch the paintings, send the originals to paris and the bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
we are talking matisse, renoir, monet. we know for sure they replaced van gogh's "vase with twelve sunflowers" last week with a copy. it was on loan from the london national gallery and they are not going to be very happy when they find out about it.
so bastaldi makes a deal with the feds to trade up for his brother?
yeah. he delivers the goods on zammito. if we got what we wanted we would let his brother go providing he tells us where the van gogh and the other paintings are.
no one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
we are leaving. raymond get the bag.
zero.   that is all i know.
you will never get out of the city.
bastaldi's dead. he is fuckin' dead!
you want zero to kill him?
I am going to kill him myself!
what about the money?
it has to be at sophie's. she did not have time to go anywhere else before she came here.
we do not know that for sure.
forget the money! we have got bigger problems than the money right now.
she probably hid it at her place.    the six of us could find it in --
this is turning to shit. if word gets out of my involvement in this I will go to prison.
listen, we know their names. they do not know the city. you will find them. you are the fbi.
i can not bring the bureau into this.    if i do the tapes become evidence.
they are supposed to be evidence.    that is why bastaldi set this up.
fuck bastaldi and his brother. these tapes are gold. do you have any idea what zammito would pay to get them back?
i thought you wanted zammito?
what for? the minute i get him some other gavone will take his place. I have been doing this for twenty years. when i retire it is not going to be to some trailer park in the suburbs.
too many people know about my involvement in this.
then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can not say anything.
i would like to thank you for your hospitality.  if you are ever in paris here is my number.
cool.
I will be right back. he gets out of the car and walks over to him.
what do you want now?
guns.   can you get them?
man, i can get anything.
do not bullshit me.
i am not bullshittin'. i can get guns. i can get any kind of gun you want. but they am not going to help your sorry ass. you am not been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in chicago looking for you. how is that possible?
I have got a way with people.
i can see that. the man's car you stole. raphael ruiz. he is head of the 19th street gang and one crazy motherfucker. and frankie zammito's got the word out he is looking for some french dudes. you are french am not ya?
I am from belgium.
yeah, I would be from belgium too if i was you. you know zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. i mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
why have not you turned us in?
i am not no rat.  you got money, right?
and, uh, I am going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
how much?
a thousand dollars?
fine.
uh... excuse me, but do not you need a warrant or something?
not today.   where are your friends?
they left about a half hour ago.
where did they go?
i dunno.
hey man, you can not do that!
what?   this?
jesus.   what kind of fbi agent are you?
I am your worst fuckin' nightmare. now, if you do not want me to keep on hurting you, it is important that i believe you and right now i don't. so tell me, where did they go?
i swear man, i do not know. they packed up and left a half hour ago.  all i got is one of their phone numbers in paris.
did you know about bastaldi's deal with zammito?
no.
you are sure?
i think if he told me he was going to steal van gogh's "sunflowers in a vase" i would remember it.
"vase with twelve sunflowers."
whatever! he never told me about the van gogh or any of the other paintings.
it makes sense. i mean, do you really think he would come along if he knew we were being set up?
i think he would cut his dick off if bastaldi told him to.
fuck you! you know I would never go along with something like this.
do i?
this am not about that and you know it. this is about you never forgiving me for leaving the crew.
you guys used to work together?
yeah and he can not stand it that i tried to do something to better myself.
you call being bastaldi's lap dog better?
better than spending my life crawling through windows in the middle of the night.
all right, knock it off.
all you are is a professional ass-kisser.
I am not a guy who is known for his patience and right now you are testing mine.
what is that a threat? are you fuckin' threatening me, marcel?
i said knock it off! now as far as I am concerned you two girls can bitch slap yourselves silly when this is over, but right now we have got to figure out what is going on.
it is simple. bastaldi's moving up. he is closing down his operation and this is his way of saying thanks to all of us.
hadley --
has to be.
this is bad. this is really fuckin' bad. am i the only one who sees how bad this is?
hey, it is not your picture on the tv, it is mine. so, try to be cool.
do not tell me to be cool! we were supposed to be in and out. in and out! in the last twenty four hours we have managed to get the mafia... the fbi... the chicago police department and a group of latin gang members after us. i have not left out anyone, have i?  i do not think so, because we have already pissed off everyone in the fuckin' city!
we have got to get out of here.
that is brilliant! care to elaborate?
you are not helping.
julien, what you are doing right now is a very normal psychological reaction to stress. you are projecting your anger onto us.
yeah?
it is me.
hey you guys are becoming famous.      i was just watching the news and--
-- did you set it up?
yeah. all set. tomorrow morning. ten o'clock. room 211. barclay hotel on river street. oh, and due to your recent notoriety and the heat that comes with it, I am going to have to increase my brokerage fee to twenty five hundred.
we had a deal.
we had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
fine.     ten o'clock.
sami, tomorrow you lift a wallet from someone who looks like one of us.
what for?
we need to rent a car and for that you need a credit card.
why not just steal another one?
too risky. we do not need to get pulled over because of a stolen car.
maybe I am missing the obvious, but why are not we leaving town? any place has to be safer for us than chicago.
it does not matter where we go. between zammito and the fbi they will find us. we have to end this here.
and how do we do that?
i do not know.
that is an excellent plan.     very comforting.
we will think of something.
why did not you tell me about this?
you have enough to worry about, angelo. you do not need my problems.
they knew who you were when they broke in your house?
yes.
what is happening with the world? there was a time no civilian would touch a made man. now every babbo in the world thinks he can get away with something. what did they take?
some cash. jewelry. the other stuff i can replace, but there is a cardboard box... photos of my mother. they are the only ones i have of her.
we are doing everything we can to find these people. right tony?
who is closer to the wall, joey or me?
get in the car.
just tell me who is closer to the wall?
there is ten grand in here. it is yours. I am going to call you again. there is one more thing i need you to do.
what?
I will tell you when it is time.
i am not comfortable with this.   I am not a good liar.
relax. it will be fine.
she seems pleasant enough.
she does not know. she thinks i fell down the stairs.
that is good.    that is what a stand-up guy does.
so, i just come by to see how you are doin'?
you broke my arm. how the hell do you think I am doin'?
yeah. i mean besides that.    they treating you all right? food okay?
yeah. I am going home today.    what do you want, frankie?
i do not want anything. i just wanted to say... that i may have... overreacted a little the other day.
a little?
yeah. i mean, you are my brother and... well i should have found another way of expressing my disappointment. so, I have decided to make it up to you.
you gonna forget about the money i owe you?
what are you nuts? a debt is a debt. i was thinking I would throw a little extra work your way. you know, you come down to the club, make espresso for the boys... wash their cars... run some errands... things like that.
agent hadley.
do you know who this is?
yeah.   i figured I would be hearing from you.
if you ever want to get those tapes, meet me in one hour at grant park near the statue.
I will drive.
I am the driver.
I have never driven a cadillac before.
this is a car. i think this is the best american car I have ever driven.
this is the only american car you have ever driven.
what are you doing?
you think I am going to talk to you until i know if you are wired.
wired?    i am not wired.
okay.   okay.    i believe you.
you killed her!
no. you killed her. manager remembers you going into her room. your fingerprints were found all over the place.
bullshit! she was alive when we left her with you.
you are fucked, sami. you know it.   that is why you are here.
look, i just want out of this nightmare. i do not know these guys. a few days ago I am in paris picking pockets and now I am america's most wanted.
where are the tapes?
i can get them -- but what do i get if i do?
a pass.
a pass? how you gonna give me a pass? a witness can put me at the crime scene.
witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. without the murder weapon the d.a. will not have enough to prosecute you.
they do not have a murder weapon?
no. i have it. the lamp? the one with your fingerprints and her blood on it?  remember?
you want the tapes for yourself.     you are going to sell them.
I am going to retire with a shit-load of money. find me a small country that does not have an extradition treaty with the states and live the good life.
you did not have to kill sophie.
yes i did.    lose ends are messy.
what about me? are not i a loose end?
when this is over you can say whatever the hell you want. I will be long gone. besides, who is going to believe you? you are just a two-bit crook.
and you are a dirty cop. at least i do not pretend to be something different than what i am.
i knew i should have driven.
stop talking. I am trying to concentrate.
when we get to the next corner jump out.
I am not going to leave you.
we both know I am already dead.
it is not your fault, daniel.
no?
we had a chance to walk out of zammito's house.
we all agreed to it. you had no way of knowing bastaldi was setting us up.
i just want to live long enough to get back to paris. just long enough to kill bastaldi.
i say we make him pay first. after that you can do whatever you want to him.
he is right. do you have any idea what van gogh's "vase with twelve sunflowers" is worth?
no.   how much?
i do not know.     it is got to be millions.
we still have to get out of here.
maybe if we gave the tapes back --
they killed our friend. it is personal now. besides, if we do that, then julien died for nothing. the tapes are the key.
he is right. the tapes give us leverage with bastaldi.
what did you guys find?
dead bodies. the ones in the lincoln are your... associates.
and the other car?
some french guy. at least that is what his passport said. you know joey, i should not be talking to you about this.
are you forgetting who supplements your income?
no. it is just that the french guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. so, this is a homicide. are you guys involved in this?
yeah. I will come down and make a full confession later. right now, tell me what else you found?
a wallet.    a hotel room card.    some cash.
what hotel?
the holiday hotel.
what room number?
i do not know.     i did not look.
go look.
okay. airports, train stations, bus station are out. we know they are connected to the car rental agencies because that is where they picked up raymond.
even if we get out of town and go to another airport I am sure the fbi and chicago p.d. has alerted customs.
how about canada?
what are we going to do, take a taxi?
get that, will you?
why do i always have to answer the phone?
because you are the closest.
I am not any closer than you are.
why is everything an argument with you?
I am just setting my boundaries.
hello?
get out of the room! you have got company coming up. I will meet you at the chevy.
raymond, grab the tapes.    we are leaving!
why do i have to pick up the tapes.
jesus!
bring me the scissors.
and the vodka.
cut his pants up the leg to the groin.

can i trust you, sami?
hey, who warned you that they were coming up to the room?
if they had taken us by surprise they would have gotten the tapes back. that would have left us with nothing.
no, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
you have not answered my question.
does it really matter what i say?
I am leaving you with my friends. I am trusting you to do the right thing today.
i will.
you better.
either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. which one is it?
i guess we are going to find out.
you rob an associate of mine... a friend and--
not such a good friend.   may i reach in my pocket?
I have got to tell you, mr. bonanno, this guy's an idiot. how he is lived this long is a mystery.
i do not think it will be a mystery much longer.
he is recorded every conversation he is had with you for years.
i assume you want something?
we have got a lot of people looking for us. we would just like to go home.
you want me to help you get out of the country?
and for my help i would get what?
half the tapes.
and the other half?
I will destroy them when we get back to paris.
i only have your word for that.
i just want to get my people home. i know who you are and what you could do to me if i do not honor my word.
where are you staying?
i only ask so i can call you when the arrangements are made.
how about if i call you?
what the fuck was all that about at the hotel last night? i thought we had a deal?
hey, you are not exactly the most trustworthy guy in the world. i took a shot. it did not work. did you bring the tapes?
okay, we are square now, right?
there is just one more thing i need you to do.
you want the tapes for yourself.     you are going to sell them.
I am going to retire with a shit-load of money. find me a small country that does not have an extradition treaty with the states and live the good life.
you did not have to kill sophie.
yes i did.    lose ends are messy.
mr. zammito?
uh huh.
i represent a person who wishes to remain anonymous, but is aware of your current financial problems with your brother.
i do not know what you are talking about.
i understand. the person who sent me wishes to help you.
how?
you see that car?
yeah.
it is yours. a gift. a gift you could give to your brother... or anyone you owe money to as partial payment.
no shit?
the papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
can you believe that guy?    what a moron.
good song though.
great fuckin' song.
this plane will take you to canada. from there you can fly back to paris.
thank you.
you have something for me?
what is this?
a car.
oh really? thanks. i thought it was a sewing machine. what the hell is it doing here?
it is for you.
for me? what am i going to do with a piece of shit like this?
i do not know. sell it. it is got to be worth something. someone gave it to me. c'mon frankie, I am trying to make good here.
okay.    okay.
I will get you the papers tomorrow.
anybody know about that car outside?
yeah.   it is mine.
no.   it is mine.
the hell it is.
I am telling you that is my car!   and someone is going to pay for it!
and I am tellin' you it ain't! now, turn your taco-eating ass around and get the hell out of here.
fuck you, grease-ball!
fuck me?   fuck you!
hello?

daniel. listen I am afraid there has been a big--
-- I have got the tapes. if you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what i say. bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
a million! i do not have that kind of money.
do not bullshit me, laurant!   i know about the van gogh.
i do not have it. that is why vincent went to chicago. they arrested him before he could bring it back.
well, you better get the money somehow. six of the clock and come alone. if you do not we will destroy the tapes.
did you have to use that much explosive?
i promised bonanno I would destroy the tapes.
this is great. after everything we have been through we have got eight hundred euros and an autographed baseball.
the baseball is mine.
no! you can not have the baseball! you are not entitled to the fuckin' baseball!
fine. all of you want to be angry? be angry... but I am the one who took the ball and that makes it mine.
no.
give it to me, sami.
no!
