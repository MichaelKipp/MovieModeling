is he in his room?
of course he is in his room.  all his "friends" are in there.
maybe i should talk to the natives.  shoom boom boo ba!  shoom boom boo ba --
andy!
oh!
but I have got a sports show. championship wrestling, at five.
you know that is not what i meant! look, I am going to put my foot down! no more playing alone.  you wanna perform, you got to have an audience!
b-but i have them.
no!  that is not an audience!  that is plaster!  an audience is people made of flesh!  they -- live and breathe!  got it?!
so, mr. besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
eh, i dunno... andy.  i'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
you are firing me??  you do not even pay me!
look -- i do not wanna seem insulting.  but... your act is like amateur hour: singalongs... puppets... playing records...
what do you want?  "take my wife, please"??
sure!  comedy!  make jokes about the traffic.  do impressions.  maybe a little blue material...
i do not swear.  i -- i do not do what everyone else does!
well, everyone else gets this place cookin'!  pal, it is hard for me to move the booze when you are singin' "pop goes the weasel."
hey, i really enjoyed your set.
tank you veddy much.
so i understand you are from lithuania?
no.  caspiar.
caspiar?  i have not heard of that.
it is a veddy small island in de caspian sea.  it sunk. george oh.  hm.  I am uh, sorry.  well, look, I am probably out of my mind -- but i think you are very interesting.  if you ever need representation... we should talk.
people love... comedians.
I am not a comedian.  i have no talent.  I am a song-and-dance man.
you show a lot of promise... but... my concern is i do not know where to book you.  you are not a stand-up... your act does not exactly translate to films... help me... where do you see yourself?
I have always wanted to play carnegie hall.
uh, yeah.  is this george shapiro?
er, yes.  speaking.
"speaking"!  reeking, seeking, creaking... freaking!
can i help you with something?
yeah!  you stay away from that andy kaufman, if you know what is good for you!
who is this? tony clifton  you -- you know damn straight who it is.  tony clifton!  a name to respect.  a name to fear.  beer.  gear.  deer.  ear.
look... i do not know what your problem is...
kaufman's a lying bastard!  if you sign him, I will ruin you!
are you at peace with your family?
um, yes.  i have not fought with them, since i started here.
goals are important.
i stopped drinking.  i gave up drugs.  and I am meditating three hours a day.  it is the center of my life...
we are all impressed.
andy, c'mon in!  thanks for flyin' out here!!
the stewardess let me keep my headphones.
that's... terrific!  but i got something better.  this is big...  you are getting a once-in-a- lifetime, unbelievably lucrative opportunity to star on... a primetime network sitcom!!!!
sitcom...?
and this is a class act!  it is the guys who did the mary tyler moore and bob newhart shows!  it takes place in a taxi stand!  and you are going to be the fonzie!
I am -- fonzie? george no!  the fonzie!  the crazy breakout character!  the guy that all the kids impersonate and put on their lunchboxes!
george, i hate sitcoms.
hang on, you am not heard the best part!  abc has seen your foreign man character, and they want to turn him into --  "latka," a lovable, goofy mechanic!!!
no.
"no"?  "no" to which part??
no to the whole thing.  none of it sounds good.
andy... this is every comedian's dream.
i told you, I am not a comedian.  and sitcoms are the lowest form of entertainment: stupid jokes and canned laughter.
b-but, this is classy... they did bob newha--
I am not interested.  i want to create my own material.
you have to do it.
i refuse.
listen, you arrogant putz!  I have been in this business for twenty years!  i know!  if you walk away from this opportunity, you will never, never see another one like it again!!!!
okay.  fine, I will do it.  but i have a few terms.
of course!  that is what negotiations are for.
are you makin' fun of me --?  this is ridiculous!
those are my terms.
they are impossible!!  jesus!  i mean -- "two guaranteed guest shots for tony clifton"??!  who is this tony clifton?!
he is a vegas entertainer.  i used to do impressions of him.  we sorta... got in a fight over that.
andy?
hi george!
eh, hi, andy.  look, this tony clifton... is he performing anywhere?
of course.  but only on monday nights.
that is alright.  where...?
sure...
what is your name?
bob.
"bob"?  bob!  bob bob bob.  bob what?
bob gorsky.
"gorsky"?  what is that, polish?
yes.
are you tryin' to do some of that polack humor?  well if that is so, you can just get the hell out of this restaurant!
it is my name.
shut up!  i hate them polish jokes!
a -- a tourist.
see, that is exactly what I am talkin' about!  here!  I will give you a little humor!
hey andy, good show.
oh george, this is bob zmuda.  bob and i have been buddies for years.
that was a really hot house!
so your name's not gorsky.
do not believe everything you hear.
andy!
what is up?
I am going to quit.
what?!?
each show is worse than the next.
are you nuts?!  40 million people watch you every week!
so?  what do they know?
absolutely nothing!  that is the beauty!  it is credibility.  you make them love you... and then later, on your special, you will screw with their heads!
andy... we do not want the viewer to get out of their chair.  they might change the channel.
but it is funny!  it is a practical joke.  they will get frustrated!
andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: the viewer must be able to see the program.
but it is only for thirty seconds!
five.
twenty!
ten.
deal.
excuse me -- ?
do you wanna wrestle?  it is a good way of breaking the ice.  that instant physical intimacy really brings two people together.
what are you talking about?!  we just met an hour ago.
no no no, it is not sex!  i mean -- it can lead to sex... but really, it is just wrestling.
i do not wanna talk about it!
what do you mean?
i mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  i love this time of day.
I have never understood that.  it is just... getting dark.  but i like you!  hey!  why do not we fill the car with gas, drive to tijuana, and get married???
look, I am sorry.  they are assholes! but we work in a creative business. you can not predict what people are going to like --
the only reason i did taxi was so i could have my own special!
tell you what.  I will book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we will show the special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
yeah, we can have a garage sale. "hey look, i got a floor lamp and a network tv special for only fifty cents!"
you signed for five years --  so four years, seven months.
okay... I will go back.  but just let them know, first they am not gettin' latka.  they are gettin' tony!
give me the book.
no!  andy, do not do it --
they are asking for it.
I am sorry, george...
you are damn right you are sorry!  and you -- you are the road manager! you should be watchin' out for him!
when you play the midwest and south, you do not mindfuck these people! it is not postmodern -- it is rude.  if you wanna perform in texas, you give 'em mighty mouse!  you give 'em elvis!!
but george, i like to push the boundaries...
and that is great.  but do it in la and new york!  there you experiment! show up with a sleeping bag and take a nap on stage!  i do not care!
how long would they let me sleep?
i do not know!  andy... you need to look inside: who are you trying to entertain?  the audience... or yourself?
I am worried about andy.  his stress level is affecting his work.
is not tony clifton going on taxi soon?  maybe that will chill him out.
bob, andy needs to relax.  see if you can get him away from all this. take him to hawaii, or bali... find something special.  something nice...
i dunno about this...  what will my mother think?
she will say, "now my son is a man."
it is so dirty.
nah.  the girls sponge off between johns.
hi, george!  good to hear from you!
hi, andy.  how is the weather up there?
oh, you know the bay area!  always foggy!
I am here with ed over at taxi. there is been some trouble with tony.
oh no!  did he get hurt?
"burlesque"?
andy, I am calling you up like this because i have the utmost respect for your artistry.  but -- i need your permission to fire him.
oh dear!  george, this is going to kill tony. he is waited his whole life for this break.
there'll be other shots.
we had a deal!!
i do not know what yer talkin' about. you musta talked to someone else --
yeah!!  i talked to andy kaufman!
i do not know nothin' about no kaufman.  he is been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. been usin' my good name, to get places.
get off my stage!  you are fired!
i got a contract!!  I am going to take you to the department of labor!
"was this in actuality andy kaufman? and if it was andy kaufman, is andy kaufman crazy?"
boy, they totally fell for it!  I am only acting crazy!
ehh -- andy does not really like playing casinos.  the audiences do not work well for him.
oh.
really?!  you want tony clifton to headline harrah's tahoe??
eh, sure.  we are trying to expand our audience base -- and i know the college kids really love andy kaufman.
look -- i gotta be clear with you. tony clifton is not andy kaufman.
yeah, yeah, yeah.  i know!  wink wink!  nudge nudge!
no, I am serious.  if you book tony, do not expect to get andy.
I will take my chances!!
gene, you misunderstood!!  you are not getting both of them!  it is physically impossible!
why is that?  you said over and over and over, tony clifton is not andy kaufman --
yeah, i know what i said!  but -- trust me, it is not going to happen!
sure it is.  tony called me himself. he yelled at me, insisting that his dressing room be bigger than andy's. they are both going on tonight, believe me!
you are so proud.  you are like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "look, dad, i got an f!"
but was not it funny?
"funny"?  i dunno.  but "intriguing"... "mindboggling"... perhaps "headache-inducing"... sure.  like, that moment, when you both came onstage...
so you have got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.  you... and you.
sure!  but we think it is kickass! now i get to be tony.  i get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!
but what is the point?  how will any of this make you the biggest star in the world?
george... I am at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them.  but short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, i do not know what else to do.  'cause I have always got to be one step ahead of them.
but i feel you are extending this philosophy to real life.  it is obsessive.  nothing's ever on the level anymore.
look at this!  an evil russian! ooo, here's an evil nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  hey, here's an evil japanese guy!
what is this, world war two...?
you know, i always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
no offense, pal, but i just do not think you are built for it.  these he- men'll kick your ass!!  they are huge!
gosh, you scored!  look at all those goodies!
buzz off.  go patronize somebody else.
hey, i hope you did not take that stuff i said seriously.  it was just part of the show!  it is like the old days, when a carnival barker would try to rile up the crowd.
oh.  so you were just pretending to be an asshole.
that means it was a success.  i woke up the audience -- like punk rock!  here, take this.
no, I am not going to take it.  if i take it I will break my back.
they are having a laugh...
wrong!  you have not given them any clues that it is a parody!
that is because they have only seen it once.  but I will do it again, and again, and again...  they will catch on!
hi...
hi... am i late?
no, I am sure we will be fine.
popcorn?
no thanks.
i really want one.  one large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
andy, the theater's that way!
hey, i love movie theater popcorn... but that does not mean i have to sit through "on golden pond."
why did you call me?  the last person i ever expected to get a call from was you.
gosh.  gee, lynne... i was just so impressed with your wrestling moves. ext. movie theater - day
hi...
hi... am i late?
no, I am sure we will be fine.
popcorn?
no thanks.
i really want one.  one large tub of popcorn, please, extra butter.
andy, the theater's that way!
hey, i love movie theater popcorn... but that does not mean i have to sit through "on golden pond."
why did you call me?  the last person i ever expected to get a call from was you.
gosh.  gee, lynne... i was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
you were impressed with something. it is pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television.
oh!  uh, i hope i did not offend you.
I am here, am not i?
do you wanna to go to memphis and get married?
do i wanna go to memphis and get married?
yes.
why memphis?
because memphis is the wrestling capital of the world!  I will go in the ring, and I will announce that i will shave my head and marry any woman who beats me!  then you will come up, we will wrestle and I will let you win!  then you will scalp me, and we will get married on letterman, like tiny tim did on carson... right there on the show!  what do you say???
and all this will be for real?
if you want...
ooo, the little lady's upset.  well i say -- get back in the kitchen!
no!  you get in the kitchen.  I am going to make you dry my dishes!
is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
i can shtop whenever i want...
then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
i-i'm sorry.  i got caught up in the action...!
andy, do you realize you do not do comedy anymore?  where is that sweet guy who used to do  "here i come to save the day!"?  please, enough with the wrestling! you have lost touch with reality!
what, you do not think i can beat him?
he is the southern heavyweight champion.  he will kill you.  first, you piss-off women.  then you piss-off the south.  then you get killed!  and i did the bookings.
I am not comfortable with the last sketch.  i do not do drug humor!
andy, it will be fine!  it is what we are known for!  "maui?  "wowie!"
you are not listening to me --
do not worry!  the kids will love it --
but i do not do drugs!  and i do not enjoy making light of them!  i was promised creative control!
i saw michael!
where?
there!
hmph!  they sure did not give andy much to do.
he said he is coming back!
go to commercial, man!  get off the stage!
i said i did not want to do the sketch.
get off!
do not touch me!
right...
okay, great!  so let's reset!
cue the commercial!
these kinds of things go on everyday at the networks, only you never see it, because they cut to commercials.  now for sure they are going to fire me, so if you want to see me again, you will have to come to memphis...
what is in memphis?
who knows?!  that kid is totally meshuga.
why is he saying these things?!
they are going to lynch him!
jesus christ!!!!!
why is not he moving??
b-but... we saw... your neck...
nah, it is phony baloney -- i faked the whole thing.  it did not hurt at all.  it was just a yoga move.  i tucked my head in.
b-but... we saw... your neck...
nah, it is phony baloney -- i faked the whole thing.  it did not hurt at all.  it was just a yoga move.  i tucked my head in.
andrew -- how dare you!!  for all we knew, you were dying!  look at your mother -- she is still shaking!
but that is it.  i needed you to believe!  our family will be in the newspapers.  people will look, and they will be touched.  because your emotions were honest!
i do not see any injury to your neck, mr. kaufman.
are you sure?
positive.
but my neck hurts... and i have a slight cough...
it is probably just a strained muscle.
doctor, i think i need a neck brace.
"... has been rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors are checking him for possible paralysis.  his parents are at his bedside.  fans will best remember kaufman as lovable latka on television's taxi"...
it is a rave!  boy, if i ever fake my death, they will really miss me.
it is working for elvis.
yeah, he is just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  god, listen to this!  "it was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."
wow, you can not buy this kind of publicity!
t-there was not a reason to purposely hurt me --
you are a wimp.
my father said i should have gotten a lawyer --!
then your father's a wimp.
and you are just poor white trash!
t-there was not a reason to purposely hurt me --
you are a wimp.
my father said i should have gotten a lawyer --!
then your father's a wimp.
and you are just poor white trash!
we were just trying to push the envelope --
you are blind!  there is no envelope anymore!!  it hurts me to say this... but there is only one solution --  i do not want you two to ever work together again.
maybe i can turn it into a bit.  i can go back on the show, and say it was rigged.  demand a recount...
andy!  you do not get it!  they do not want you back.
excuse me, andy...
yes, your holiness?
this is very difficult for me to say... but -- perhaps it would be best if you did not attend the retreat.
why??  i... i attend every year.
yes -- we do not doubt your devotion to tm.  but we feel that perhaps... you and the program have grown apart philosophically.
"philosophically"?
the wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  it seems you have no respect for anything.
please!  you have got to let me take the classes!  it is how i keep myself balanced!!
it is apparently not working.
so help me!  all i wanna do is meditate!!
andy, do not raise your voice.  we do not wish your presence here.
go away.
it is me.
oh, it is open.
i brought you haagen dazs. chocolate.
i do not deserve haagen daz.  I am a horrible person.
andy, you are not horrible.  you are just... complicated.
you do not know the real me.
andy... there is no real you.
hey!  our first phone call!  hello?
andy... it is me.  I have got some crummy news.  taxi's been canceled.
sir, do you have a problem?
yeah, my problem is you are tired.
i, i was asked to do this material - -
sure, because your new stuff's a bunch of crap.  kaufman, people are sick of you.  the wrestling... the hoaxes...
hey -- that stuff gets written-up in the papers --
who gives a shit?!  it is not funny!
why...?  andy, why...?
i used to think you were original.
i was very original!
yeah, exactly -- "was"!  but now, you are creatively bankrupt.  in fact, ladies and gentlemen, kaufman's so desperate, he paid me to do this tonight!!  I am a plant. it is just a fresh coat of paint on an old broken-down routine.  is not that true???
the world thinks andy kaufman sucks. so i was just giving 'em what they want...
andy, they do not think you suck. they have just... lost a reason to love you.
hey, that is good!  we can make that play.  and we will really drag it out.  you get better, you get worse... you die...
forget it.  it is in terrible taste! i want nothing to do with this.
no, it is true.  i have lung cancer.
that is ridiculous.  you do not even smoke.
i -- i got some freaky rare kind. it is called large-celled carcinoma.
jesus, andy!  can they cure it?
they do not know... they have got to run more tests.
have you told your family?
no, no!  not yet.  i feel bad -- I have jerked 'em around so many times.
if i find out you are behind this, I will kill you.
what are ya talkin' about?!  i was the one saying i did not believe it!
how can you be so casual??!
even if I am dying -- i still need clean socks.
you are not dying!
okay.  you are probably right.
what was that all about?
it is visualization therapy.  he is helping me turn inward and fight the disease.
you must take a little pleasure in it.
of course!  but that does not mean i do not need everyone's support!  i can not be surrounded by negative energy.
andy, you are surrounded by what you create.  you are the king of negative energy.
y-yeah?  well, then it has to stop! because if these bad vibes get out... then everyone will be talkin' about how sick i am, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy, and then -- I am dead.
so how can i help you...?
i wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  the best show anybody's ever seen!
do you wanna tour the clubs?
no clubs.  i wanna reach the top!  carnegie hall...!
this is great.  the crowd's going to love this!  hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?
i dunno.  if they were, they would be pushin' 80.
well, call sag.  it would be cool to get one on the show.  i want the evening to build and build.  it is going to have the most incredible ending: singers, dancers, the "hallelujah chorus" -- then the sky opens, and santa claus comes flying down!
and you say, "santa, what am i gettin' for christmas?"  and he says, "cancer!"
no!  no no no!  none of that!  i want this show to be positive!
i do not care about the money.  i just want the show to deliver.
so who is going to pay for it?
tony clifton.
you know tony does not have that kind of money.
then he will borrow it.  i know tony better than you do.  even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he will do it!
i can not move my arm.
you have got good days and bad days.
my hair is coming out.
yeah...
did your -- doctor say it is okay for you to go back to work?
ehhh, you know those guys.  if he had his way, I would be stuck in the hospital, running tests all day.  and anyway, I have found a new guy who is going to be able to instantly remove the cancer.
really?
yeah!  he is a psychic surgeon in the philippines, and he is amazing!  he rubs you and sucks the disease right out!
it is a perfect kaufman audience.
yeah.  they do not know whether to be sad, or angry.
