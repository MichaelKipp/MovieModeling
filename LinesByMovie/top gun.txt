i've got a six strobe.  i think he's locked on us.
it's a mig 21. they don't have radar missiles!
let's hope you're right!
what is he doing?
he's pissing me off!
can't shake him.
what's mig one doing?
maintaining course. straight for mustang.
that's missile lock!
he better be kidding!
lordy!  eyeball to asshole. hope nobody burps!
i'll lock on them, cougar.  gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
i'm up here too, maverick.
roger, cougar.  okay boys, pull out with your hands up and nobody'll get hurt.
we're locked on mig one. why doesn't he disengage?
these guys are getting on my nerves.
ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  we're gonna get them wet unless we find a sonoco station.
cougar, this is maverick.  i'm getting hungry, let's head for the barn. ...cougar, where are you?
hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... instead of just us.
you.
help me with this one, i'm really screwed up.
bring it left. bring it left, you're high.
this is crazy!
what is?
wait! hell!..something's wrong!
what?  what is it?
were upside down!
you're crazy. we're level.
can't you feel it? i'm hanging in my straps!
you're not. we're level. look at the instruments, we're okay!
they must be broken. i'm hanging in my straps! we're inverted!
we're not! trust me! we're okay.
i...forgot something.
what the hell you doing?
helping him in.
what makes you think we can get back in?  we don't have the fuel for this. maverick just get me to him.
i'm pulling up.
no! now we're inverted!
what are you doing here?
everybody's got to be somewhere. ..now we're right with you. you are inverted.  roll it, cougar.
we're on vapor, cougar, you got to put it down.
it's crazy, man. instruments are crazy. we're gonna have to eject.
tell him, will you tell him? our instruments are okay.
maverick.
yeah, cougar?
you better not be ragging me... if you're flying upside down...
no joke, cougar. on the level. even i wouldn't do that to you.
i'm upside down. i know it. i'm gonna eject.
look at the weather! they'll never find us! we're near out of fuel. put it down.
cougar, you're on the ball.
okay... okay. but if i land this thing upside down. and i live. i'll have your butt!
you'll have mine, cougar. it'll be where your head used to be.
don't worry. i'll talk to him.
don't.
he's a good pilot.
i talked a man back once. three months later, we lost him. it's his decision. only he knows.
he's the best you have. he's going top gun!
was.
was going.  now you are.
me?
well, he's going  and he needs someone to fly the plane.
skipper, you can't do this!
i didn't do it, he did it himself. something about a wife and kid. the fact is, he's lost it. he knows it. i know it. you were up there, you know it, too. goose give him a break, skipper. it was raining snakes up there. he'll be alright, soon as all the gorillas go home...
but, skipper, cougar's been picked for top gun...he's the best of the best!
well, you'll just have to make do with him .
mav's a great flyer but....
he's a hell of a flyer. in fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for top gun himself. except for one thing.  he just can't seem to follow orders!
you just did an incredibly brave thing! what you should have done was land your plane. you don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. i should ream you out for it. but it just doesn't work with you. you're a hell of a flyer. you are maybe ...too good. you never really stepped in it yet. so this is your chance. i'm gonna send you up against the best. they are better than you. maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. maverick hasn't really heard anything but topgun. he snaps out of it.
sir?
that is all. tell me about the mig some other time...
yes sir!
yes sir..
the wings..
well... what   is   it?
sir. you are going to give me a warning, sir!
yes sir. i do, sir.
well?
sir. i was going mach point one five.
one sixth the speed of sound!
yes sir.
lieutenant... what do you... usually fly?
f-14's sir.
tomcats?
yes sir!
lieutenant... is there... a russian attack?
no sir! but you have to be ready.
yes, sergeant?
remember one thing.
sir?
outside of this gate... i...am top gun.
yes sir!
what are you doing?
nothing...that's mcgown...that's singer, isn't it? goose turn around, pay attention. what are you doing?
considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
yes sir.
i like that in a fighter pilot.  it's okay to be confident. you have to think you're king kong to want to try to land on carriers. just keep in mind the other component of success...teamwork.
a plaque?
it's not the plaque. the winner can get assigned here as instructor. he gets to fight every day.
keller, black lion squadron. i knew him at pensacola. he's damn good.
is there anybody in the navy you don't know?
gotta keep track of the competition.
slider -- they let you into top gun? if you're among the best in the navy, i tremble for the security of this country.
why goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
the list is long, but distinguished.
so's my johnson.
this is maverick.
so i've heard.
who's your pilot?
tom kazansky.
no shit. the iceman....
mister to you.
you think you can stay up with us.
i think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
this is evan mitchell, he steers the thing.
so i heard. steers it pretty close. sorry to hear about cougar. he was a good man.
what was that?
flaming hooker. sort of an institution around here. or maybe this is the institution, i forget which. it's the house drink. it'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.
you ever done this before?
what, been drunk? sure! plenty!
how was it?
could use a dash more jet fuel.
that's kazanski.
no shit! that why they call him ice?
nope. it's the way he flies - ice cold. no mistakes. wears you down. after enough time, you just get bored and frustrated, you do something stupid, and he's got you.
why do you all have such funny names?
you gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. then, if someone shouts "wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
why do they call you wolf?
hey mav, this is sally. she doesn't believe a word i say. tell her i'm married, will you?
yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
well, i don't know. that depends.
on what?
well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
like what?
oh...i'll think of something.
figured it out yet?
figured out what?
who is the best.
nope.
need a hint?
i think i can work it out on my own.
you like to work alone. i've heard that about you.
i've heard of you, too. you were in 124 with bargamian.
and you were with cougar. he was my roommate in flight school.
it's not cougar's place. it's ours.
what do you think it was? was it that mig contact that did it?
did what?
got you here.
we're here because we're the best flyers in the wing. not because of some mig encounter.
what do these guys think, i made cougar quit?
pay no attention to it. they're just trying to rattle you. it's all psychological. sit down..and drink.
i'll bet!
uhhh...anything i can do for you? she laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
yeah. hold this. it might be safer.
now i know why all the girls come here. they know how horny you guys get. but this...is ridiculous.
it's not that.
it isn't?
well, it is. it is that, too.
that's a big comfort to me.
i could be, too.
how so?
save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
and on to a bigger one with you?
yeah, most likely.
was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
i heard of one once.
can i walk you out?she turns back to him, a smile.
i'm with someone.
i thought he'd never leave.
yeow!
everybody's got to be somewhere.
what if captain dawson had come with me?
it would have been really embarrassing!
how did you know this was my car?
simple deduction. it's fast. it's pretty. sleek and stylish...it's your color...matches your lipstick.
that's all!
and i asked someone. charlie you think you're pretty smart.
i beg your pardon.
no, i beg yours. but i don't think you're right on that.
why not?
i saw one.
you saw a mig 21?
i saw a mig do a 4 g negative dive.
where did you see that?
it's classified.
it's what?
it's classified. like hollywood says, i could tell you, but then i'd have to kill you.
lieutenant, i have a top secret clearance. the pentagon sees to it that i know more than you.
not in this case. charlie  you saw a mig push negative 4g?
yes, ma'am.
where were you?
on his six.
he was in a 4g negative dive and you were on his six?
yes, ma'am, at first. then i was directly above him.
if you were directly above him, how did you see him?
i was inverted.
two.
two miles.
two meters.
the what?
you know. the finger.
it never came up.
you let me make a fool of myself.
you seemed determined to do that anyway.. why didn't you tell me you were a famous mig insulter? maverick would it have made a difference?
no.
what would?
you know, i'm assigned to this school. i see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. your attention is flattering, but not really productive. why don't you keep your mind on flying.
maverick... where'd you get that call sign?
ahhh... runs in the family, sir.
you're father was marvin mitchell..
yes sir.
a good man. good flyer.
i've lost him -- where is he?
on your six -- coming hard. four hundred. losing airspeed! he's on your six and closing fast! hard left! hard left!
great move. great
he should've had me. goose take it down. let's bug out of here. call for a draw.
we did it!
look, ma, top of the world!
ahhh...a little high on the left, don't you think?
right.
it's a victory roll.
i wouldn't call it victory.  it's more like...self immolation.
hi...hi there. how ya doing in there?  mav... ahhh...you know, at one point i did want a navy career.
come on, relax...
you see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... oh, no, i think that was johnson, air boss of the kitty hawk!
come on, we beat an instructor. how many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
just once, if they take your plane away.
nice. always a good idea to show up your instructors. he nods toward jester, glaring at them from his a4. goose indicates the backseat of the tomcat.
hey, see any controls back there?  and anyway...we beat the son of a bitch!
you won?!!!
didn't everybody?
no, we...got our butts kicked.
thirty seconds. that's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
that's not what i heard.
we won! ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
below the hard deck doesn't count. you guys are the second team, aren't you?
i had him in view. i was peeling over the egg, into a dive. he saw me when i moved in for the kill. there wasn't any danger...
is that how you remember it?
the hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
just below ten thousand.
but you continued to fight.
why?
we weren't below for more than ten seconds. there was no danger. i had the shot. i took it.
the rules of engagement are not flexible. they exist for your safety. you will obey them. is that clear?
i don't know what to tell you, skip.
tell me one thing.
he's seat of the pants... completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. all over the sky. but i don't know, skip, he's really got something.
yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "maverick!"
man, you guys gooned it. your laser butts are scattered across kansas.
come on. i died enough for one night.
what would you say, too fast...too quick...
and far too aggressive.
it is combat. every second counts.
well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. who can match you move for move. then you've got something.  i'm sorry.
for what?
that stuff about the mig. i was out of line.
apology acknowledged.
is that all? charlie what else do you want?
um. you.
there you go with those moves again.
too aggressive?
i don't mix with the boys. i work here. let's keep it professional.
i'm special.
yes. i'll give you that!
give me a break, i'm asking you out.
i can't.
i thought there was something... that night in the club...
lieutenant...
evan... or maverick.
maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
the what?
some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
what are you talking about?
you turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
i'm not your foe. charlie and if he's harmless, you disengage.
harmless!
uh hum.
what if he's not?
you have to shoot him down....if he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
and probably never again. it's nothing personal. it's just...i know a lot of pilots. maybe i'm immune...
don't worry, i'm a new strain. and i don't give up. everything i've ever wanted i've had to work like hell for. well, how about it?
how about what?
how about anything, anything you want to do.
hard to argue with that, isn't it...
a date... coffee... a drink...a walk in the park.
what about the plane?
what plane.
most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. maverick well, get used to it.
used to what?
i'm different.
i'm starting to sense that now.
let's make it at eight.
make what?
anything.
okay, anything. just...go. i've gotta work.
why'd you do that?

it dies. we live.
you're an animal.
that's true. what are you?
i don't enjoy watching things suffer.
no!
it's not suffering anymore.
you're horrible
you're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    things die. every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. every time you eat, something had to die.
you don't have to kill it.
somebody does. it's more honest this way. you do your own dirty work.
you ever think about killing another human being?
about as much as they think about killing me.
does it bother you?
they know the rules... that's the deal. that's why you're up there. it's him or me. that's the price of admission.  it bothers you, why? you're part of it.   everybody dies. most people don't get to die for something.
you know what really scares me? living too long. losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. and my brains...sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime tv.
you don't believe any of this. you don't think you'll ever die.
that's it, of course. when i'm up there and doing it, i'm cheating it every second. i'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. i'm skating the edge of it.
winston churchill.
what he said..."there's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
all you've got is one life. i guess it's worth about the same to every body. you ever see an old woman after her husband has died? and the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  when you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. that's your whole future. that's as far as it goes. but imagine what those seconds are worth.
what if you kill yourself? think of everything you'll miss. maverick there is lots of stuff i don't know about...  fine wine... great art... the opera. i guess if i live long enough, i'll get to it. if i don't, i'll never miss it.
are you really that brave?
i watched my mother die. cancer. she had a long time to think about it. they say you reach an agreement with death. come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. i didn't see that. she... was very brave...braver than i am. you go up there, there isn't time to think. if you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. simplifies funeral arrangements.
it's just as i thought.
what?
you're totally insane.
thanks very much.  care for some suchi?.
come on, we're next.
what?
come on, i got over six bucks on the line.
come on, come on! it's double or nothing.. we're talking twelve bucks american, here.
i've had enough...for now.
come on.
where?
you want to go ballistic?
i don't know. i don't like being out of control.
i always wanted to fly... ever since i first saw a jet. i wanted to fly jets, then i wanted f-14's, then i wanted to fly off carriers, then i wanted top gun.
and now?
and now i want you.
you always get what you want?
i don't know yet.
i want it understood.
anything.
no fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. by anyone.
why?
i'm a professional. you guys are in my line of work.
i wasn't thinking. i just did it.
big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
what the hell is this?
don't chew it, you won't have it that long. easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
i was a victim of circumstance.
they should have warned you about that one.
she's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. the noise alone kept me up.
what'd you do?
pulled left, rolled out, underneath.
it's kind of ironic. all you guys have women troubles and i don't.
that's because you don't have any women.
until last night. did you see the moves i was making on that girl at the party?
the girl with the purple fingernails?
that's her--tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. it was great.
it was bad.
bad?
the girl with the purple fingernails was coogan's sister.
coogan spent half the night looking for her. he said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister.
i didn't ruin her.
you didn't help.
no, really. she came ruined!... ya think he knows it was me?
hear about ice?
what now?
he won again.
something bothering you?
nothing. let's just go fight.
morning, coogan.
how's it goin', coog?
stay with him! tighten your turn!
bogey at three o'clock high! nose on!
snapshot..missed him..
engaging the other guy. wood, you're on your own.
just cover wood, maverick. mutual support, man!
i'm gonna take him, goose.
don't be greedy. stay with wood.
i want him!
what what are you doing? we're cover!
wood's okay. i want viper.
walked right into it.
not only that, but zorro got your wingman. nice going.
twenty years' experience, i couldn't shake you. you may be a great flyer. i mean that.
i lost.
of course you did. i said a great flyer, not a smart one. you fly reckless. great instincts. no discipline. that ambush today, you followed your emotions instead of your wingman. of course you got killed...and well deserved to. it was a really stupid mistake. in battle, it gets people killed.
i can take care of myself.
talent is no holy shield. von richtofen was killed by a farm boy. instincts are not enough. do it our way. we've worked these things out. the good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    why do you have to do everything the hard way?
it's my own way. it works for me. i don't care about the rest of that stuff.
then why are you here?
for the same reason you are.
oh, you mean the thrill!
the flying. the fighting.  i'd go up there ten times a day to fight. i'd win at least nine of them. that's all i want to do. it's what i do best. i am real good.  just give me the jet.
relationships are a bitch, here. it's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. having a woman here is asking for it.
i guess that's what i'm doing, then.
where do you find the time? where do you find the energy. it's tough enough to keep your mind on school. a woman here is a real pain in the...
food...and you...my f-14!
in that order?
well no...inverse order.
i'm still second best.
you ever fly an f-14?
i don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.
danger?
. yeah!
doesn't it ever bother you?
why, what's gonna happen?
lucky charm.
what do you take me for? it's a navy cross.
just good luck.
where'd you get it.
pawn shop. what's to eat?
engaging bandit 12 o'clock.
shit!!
come off right--come off high--i'm in--i'll engage.
stay where you are. he's mine. i'm engaged. i'm in.
get out of there, you're unsafe. get out of there.
fire, or clear out, ice.
get lost!
you got too much nose to tail -- i'm coming in.
it's my shot.
come off--come off right. i'm on my way in. you go free, i'm engaging.
stay out of it. stay out of it, maverick.
you can't shoot him, i can. i'm in.
ice, roll off, i can shoot him.
no, no, no, he's mine.
if you can't shoot him, i can.
no, i got him. i can take him.
i'm pinned to the panel.
time to go.
i can't eject.
3000 feet. i'll do it.
go ahead. i can't reach. 2000 feet!
1000.
let's go. eject.
how do you feel?
all right.
goose is dead.
i know. i was there.
he was...my responsibility--my rio.
my first squadron in vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. ten guys. the first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
...they say you're alright.
i'm fine.
this is it, then.
what?
the dark side. the price you pay for all the fun you're having. you knew about it, of course. didn't you?
he was a friend of mine. a good guy...great guy. it was my fault.
that's not what i hear.
i was flying...my responsibility.
that's what you get flight pay for.
maybe i shouldn't take it.
why? you act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
not to me.
you knew it. you all do. it's part of it. maybe the most important part.
where are we?
where are we? you know where we are. it's called the beach. it's where life first crawled up out of the sea. i come here sometimes... when i feel like crawling back in.
you don't have to do this.
do what, show you a good time?
i'm not good company. i should be alone.
i don't think so, but if that's what you want...
no.
what do you want?
i want it back.
what?
yesterday.
you look way out there. out past the date line. west becomes east, all things change. you cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, i forget which.
that's what i want.
of course the line's just imaginary. you can cross it twenty times...nothing really changes.
you don't believe that.
hardly ever.
only when you're depressed. then it passes.
it does.
everything passes. immutable law of the universe.
what do you do when you come here?
i sit. i think. i play games.
what kind of games?
i like to play "reality".
how do you play reality.
it's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
strip reality! how do you play that?
it's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  one person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
you're crazy.  that's a pretty silly game.
not as silly as some. you know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. that we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
want to play the game?
how does it go?
you say the truth.  go ahead. don't be afraid. you want to win the game, don'tcha?
what truth?
the big one. the one that's most on your mind.
goose is dead.
true.
now?
take something off.
off me or off you?
that's up to you.
what does it mean?
that wasn't fair. it was a question. penalty round!
you didn't mean it. you didn't think. you'd do anything to take it back.
that's three.
and that's one!
one more.
your watch.
looks like a tie.
who's gonna win?
we'll say it together. on the count of three...one...two...
what? where're you--hey, where in the hell are you going?
didn't ... ahhh...look good.
what do you mean? it doesn't get to look much better than that?
no. no good.
he just won't engage. he can't do it, skipper. he can't get back on the horse.
it's only been a week. keep sending him up.
i've seen this before.
so have i.
some guys never get it back.
what are you doing?
saving them some paperwork.
since when did you care about paperwork?
if i could fly like you i'd have everything i want. if i could fly at all. i can't fly. i can't fly like that. nobody can. whatever it is, you've got it!
not anymore.
so, you're scared--so what? you ever get a good look at me in the back seat, i'm goddamn terrified.
you weren't gonna say goodbye?
i was, later.
long distance? i wouldn't do that to you. i'd at least talk to you.
i didn't want to see you. i mean, i did...but i didn't..
i know exactly what you mean.
how could you?
i've got a gift just like you do. my gift is i just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. it helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. like what you just said was "i'm embarrassed, i feel i've done something wrong, that i've failed, and i don't think i can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." that about it?
...something like that.
and i'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until i can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
hey, i never said i was a fighter pilot...i never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. i can find contentment in a good book. i don't have to roar by someone at mach two with my hair on fire. sometimes...i just get happy being with the right man.
i hope you find him.
i think i have... i could be wrong. i have been before. just remember one thing. if you're not top gun, if you're not fighting jets, you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot... you're gonna have to act like the rest of us. you're gonna have to master humility. for you guys, that's the toughest maneuver of all.
skipper, sorry to bother you.
no bother.
i called your house.
my wife's house.
she said you took your kid to the each. every second sunday. zoo or beach or the ballgame. y'have the option... what about me?
we can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "cnc" --course not completed, no explanation required. theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
or....
or you can quit.
i don't know...
i didn't know either. that's why i told jester to prepare your papers.
it's no disgrace, kid. that spin was hell. it would wreck anyone's confidence. you could be a good pilot again someday...
you think i should quit?!
i didn't say that. that's up to you. but i have responsibility for the other guys up there, not just you. they need to know you're all right...that they can depend on you.
sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... i served with your old man.
i know.
vf 51, the oriskany. you remind me of him. you're just like he was, only better...and worse.
i'm nothing like him.
you may not think so, but you are.
he was by the book, all the way.
they waved him off. he thought he knew better. he hit the ramp.
i never heard that.
not something they tell dependents.
it's not true.
how can i go on? i feel so... responsible.
kid, the plain fact is...you are. i'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. technically, they absolved you. you and i know what really happened. you pushed it. you are responsible and you'll always carry that. you know what, i'll carry it too. i should have taken you out of that cockpit. i guess i'm a hopeless romantic... i always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. it's no trade-off. it's not one for one. what you learned isn't worth his death. it couldn't be. but maybe there is some value in it. i know it's the first thing i've ever seen that's really gotten to you. now the question is, what will you do with it. if it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. that's one good thing. you were an accident waiting to happen.
you think i shouldn't fly.
i didn't say that. that's up to you. i think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
would you take me back? would they?
i'll have to think about it. i don't know about them. i do know one thing, we've got a lot invested in you. we'd hate to lose it. even more than those other guys, naval aviation needs a very few, very good men.
i've got two more bogeys coming in at four o'clock high.
got 'em.
bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. take him. pull on the goddamn stick, man!
okay, okay.
don't tell me okay. do it!
break left! break left!   chaff! flares!
breaking left!
okay, going up. ice, go high.
look out!
on the nose?
got 'em. got good tone.
there's another one up there!
i got one coming up.
and he's gunning.
ohhh mother!
goddamnit, mav, you really are a slow learner. don't worry, fung, i've got it.
don't worry!!!?   you've got it!!? are you crazy?
roger, i've got it.
now have you got it?  have you still got it?
yawing right.
i know!
rudder's left, stick's forward.
swell! passing ten thousand!
i've got it -- hold on!
passing 8. passing 6. lock your harness!
i can recover. hold on!
5000 feet. speed two hundred.
okay.
no! not again!
what are you talking about, we gotta go!
i'm not losing it again!
gotta go, man.
280, 290, 300 knots.
3,000 feet.  we gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
you go. i'm staying with it.
i'm gonna go! three...two...one...
i got a winder left, but no good tone on it.
i can't lose him, can you get off a shot?
i got no tone. it might get you.
what choice do i have?   shoot it.
when i shoot, you break left..3..2
is there something i should know?
just relax.
is it the plane?
the plane is fine.
is it you?
yeah, i guess it is. we did it! we did it...damn! we sure did it!
you're not supposed to...
but i have to!
then...shit! go ahead. i'm right behind you.
mustang, this is maverick, request a flyby.
i guess i owe you one.
you don't owe me anything. we're on the same team.
you saved our lives. you did it!
we did it.
you're a hell of a flyer.  you can be my wingman any time.
no. you can be mine!
you hear that? anything we want. anything...well???
well what?
what do you want?
what do i want?
what do you want?
any more migs?
who's the hell is that?
three guesses.
well, he's in trouble and he didn't even get here yet.
let me do the talking.
oh, no. you did the flying, i'll do the talking!
well?
well what?
you got your f-14, you got top gun, you got your migs....you're our new top gun instructor...now what?
oh...i'll think of something... what are you doing here?
i live here, remember?
right on the flight line?
i've got a six strobe.  i think he's locked on us.
it's a mig 21. they don't have radar missiles!
let's hope you're right!
what is he doing?
he's pissing me off!
can't shake him.
what's mig one doing?
maintaining course. straight for mustang.
that's missile lock!
he better be kidding!
lordy!  eyeball to asshole. hope nobody burps!
i'll lock on them, cougar.  gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
i'm up here too, maverick.
roger, cougar.  okay boys, pull out with your hands up and nobody'll get hurt.
we're locked on mig one. why doesn't he disengage?
these guys are getting on my nerves.
ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  we're gonna get them wet unless we find a sonoco station.
cougar, this is maverick.  i'm getting hungry, let's head for the barn. ...cougar, where are you?
hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... instead of just us.
you.
help me with this one, i'm really screwed up.
bring it left. bring it left, you're high.
this is crazy!
what is?
wait! hell!..something's wrong!
what?  what is it?
were upside down!
you're crazy. we're level.
can't you feel it? i'm hanging in my straps!
you're not. we're level. look at the instruments, we're okay!
they must be broken. i'm hanging in my straps! we're inverted!
we're not! trust me! we're okay.
i...forgot something.
what the hell you doing?
helping him in.
what makes you think we can get back in?  we don't have the fuel for this. maverick just get me to him.
i'm pulling up.
no! now we're inverted!
what are you doing here?
everybody's got to be somewhere. ..now we're right with you. you are inverted.  roll it, cougar.
we're on vapor, cougar, you got to put it down.
it's crazy, man. instruments are crazy. we're gonna have to eject.
tell him, will you tell him? our instruments are okay.
maverick.
yeah, cougar?
you better not be ragging me... if you're flying upside down...
no joke, cougar. on the level. even i wouldn't do that to you.
i'm upside down. i know it. i'm gonna eject.
look at the weather! they'll never find us! we're near out of fuel. put it down.
cougar, you're on the ball.
okay... okay. but if i land this thing upside down. and i live. i'll have your butt!
you'll have mine, cougar. it'll be where your head used to be.
don't worry. i'll talk to him.
don't.
he's a good pilot.
i talked a man back once. three months later, we lost him. it's his decision. only he knows.
he's the best you have. he's going top gun!
was.
was going.  now you are.
me?
well, he's going  and he needs someone to fly the plane.
skipper, you can't do this!
i didn't do it, he did it himself. something about a wife and kid. the fact is, he's lost it. he knows it. i know it. you were up there, you know it, too. goose give him a break, skipper. it was raining snakes up there. he'll be alright, soon as all the gorillas go home...
but, skipper, cougar's been picked for top gun...he's the best of the best!
well, you'll just have to make do with him .
mav's a great flyer but....
he's a hell of a flyer. in fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for top gun himself. except for one thing.  he just can't seem to follow orders!
you just did an incredibly brave thing! what you should have done was land your plane. you don't own that plane, the taxpayers do. i should ream you out for it. but it just doesn't work with you. you're a hell of a flyer. you are maybe ...too good. you never really stepped in it yet. so this is your chance. i'm gonna send you up against the best. they are better than you. maybe they'll knock that shine off your eagle and you'll see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. maverick hasn't really heard anything but topgun. he snaps out of it.
sir?
that is all. tell me about the mig some other time...
yes sir!
yes sir..
the wings..
well... what   is   it?
sir. you are going to give me a warning, sir!
yes sir. i do, sir.
well?
sir. i was going mach point one five.
one sixth the speed of sound!
yes sir.
lieutenant... what do you... usually fly?
f-14's sir.
tomcats?
yes sir!
lieutenant... is there... a russian attack?
no sir! but you have to be ready.
yes, sergeant?
remember one thing.
sir?
outside of this gate... i...am top gun.
yes sir!
what are you doing?
nothing...that's mcgown...that's singer, isn't it? goose turn around, pay attention. what are you doing?
considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
yes sir.
i like that in a fighter pilot.  it's okay to be confident. you have to think you're king kong to want to try to land on carriers. just keep in mind the other component of success...teamwork.
a plaque?
it's not the plaque. the winner can get assigned here as instructor. he gets to fight every day.
keller, black lion squadron. i knew him at pensacola. he's damn good.
is there anybody in the navy you don't know?
gotta keep track of the competition.
slider -- they let you into top gun? if you're among the best in the navy, i tremble for the security of this country.
why goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
the list is long, but distinguished.
so's my johnson.
this is maverick.
so i've heard.
who's your pilot?
tom kazansky.
no shit. the iceman....
mister to you.
you think you can stay up with us.
i think, yeah, we'll show you a thing or two.
this is evan mitchell, he steers the thing.
so i heard. steers it pretty close. sorry to hear about cougar. he was a good man.
what was that?
flaming hooker. sort of an institution around here. or maybe this is the institution, i forget which. it's the house drink. it'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.
you ever done this before?
what, been drunk? sure! plenty!
how was it?
could use a dash more jet fuel.
that's kazanski.
no shit! that why they call him ice?
nope. it's the way he flies - ice cold. no mistakes. wears you down. after enough time, you just get bored and frustrated, you do something stupid, and he's got you.
why do you all have such funny names?
you gotta have a call sign that's just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. then, if someone shouts "wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
why do they call you wolf?
hey mav, this is sally. she doesn't believe a word i say. tell her i'm married, will you?
yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
well, i don't know. that depends.
on what?
well, it doesn't just happen, you gotta do something famous.
like what?
oh...i'll think of something.
figured it out yet?
figured out what?
who is the best.
nope.
need a hint?
i think i can work it out on my own.
you like to work alone. i've heard that about you.
i've heard of you, too. you were in 124 with bargamian.
and you were with cougar. he was my roommate in flight school.
it's not cougar's place. it's ours.
what do you think it was? was it that mig contact that did it?
did what?
got you here.
we're here because we're the best flyers in the wing. not because of some mig encounter.
what do these guys think, i made cougar quit?
pay no attention to it. they're just trying to rattle you. it's all psychological. sit down..and drink.
i'll bet!
uhhh...anything i can do for you? she laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
yeah. hold this. it might be safer.
now i know why all the girls come here. they know how horny you guys get. but this...is ridiculous.
it's not that.
it isn't?
well, it is. it is that, too.
that's a big comfort to me.
i could be, too.
how so?
save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
and on to a bigger one with you?
yeah, most likely.
was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
i heard of one once.
can i walk you out?she turns back to him, a smile.
i'm with someone.
i thought he'd never leave.
yeow!
everybody's got to be somewhere.
what if captain dawson had come with me?
it would have been really embarrassing!
how did you know this was my car?
simple deduction. it's fast. it's pretty. sleek and stylish...it's your color...matches your lipstick.
that's all!
and i asked someone. charlie you think you're pretty smart.
i beg your pardon.
no, i beg yours. but i don't think you're right on that.
why not?
i saw one.
you saw a mig 21?
i saw a mig do a 4 g negative dive.
where did you see that?
it's classified.
it's what?
it's classified. like hollywood says, i could tell you, but then i'd have to kill you.
lieutenant, i have a top secret clearance. the pentagon sees to it that i know more than you.
not in this case. charlie  you saw a mig push negative 4g?
yes, ma'am.
where were you?
on his six.
he was in a 4g negative dive and you were on his six?
yes, ma'am, at first. then i was directly above him.
if you were directly above him, how did you see him?
i was inverted.
two.
two miles.
two meters.
the what?
you know. the finger.
it never came up.
you let me make a fool of myself.
you seemed determined to do that anyway.. why didn't you tell me you were a famous mig insulter? maverick would it have made a difference?
no.
what would?
you know, i'm assigned to this school. i see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. your attention is flattering, but not really productive. why don't you keep your mind on flying.
maverick... where'd you get that call sign?
ahhh... runs in the family, sir.
you're father was marvin mitchell..
yes sir.
a good man. good flyer.
i've lost him -- where is he?
on your six -- coming hard. four hundred. losing airspeed! he's on your six and closing fast! hard left! hard left!
great move. great
he should've had me. goose take it down. let's bug out of here. call for a draw.
we did it!
look, ma, top of the world!
ahhh...a little high on the left, don't you think?
right.
it's a victory roll.
i wouldn't call it victory.  it's more like...self immolation.
hi...hi there. how ya doing in there?  mav... ahhh...you know, at one point i did want a navy career.
come on, relax...
you see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... oh, no, i think that was johnson, air boss of the kitty hawk!
come on, we beat an instructor. how many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
just once, if they take your plane away.
nice. always a good idea to show up your instructors. he nods toward jester, glaring at them from his a4. goose indicates the backseat of the tomcat.
hey, see any controls back there?  and anyway...we beat the son of a bitch!
you won?!!!
didn't everybody?
no, we...got our butts kicked.
thirty seconds. that's all it took to blow us out of the sky.
that's not what i heard.
we won! ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
below the hard deck doesn't count. you guys are the second team, aren't you?
i had him in view. i was peeling over the egg, into a dive. he saw me when i moved in for the kill. there wasn't any danger...
is that how you remember it?
the hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
just below ten thousand.
but you continued to fight.
why?
we weren't below for more than ten seconds. there was no danger. i had the shot. i took it.
the rules of engagement are not flexible. they exist for your safety. you will obey them. is that clear?
i don't know what to tell you, skip.
tell me one thing.
he's seat of the pants... completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. all over the sky. but i don't know, skip, he's really got something.
yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "maverick!"
man, you guys gooned it. your laser butts are scattered across kansas.
come on. i died enough for one night.
what would you say, too fast...too quick...
and far too aggressive.
it is combat. every second counts.
well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. who can match you move for move. then you've got something.  i'm sorry.
for what?
that stuff about the mig. i was out of line.
apology acknowledged.
is that all? charlie what else do you want?
um. you.
there you go with those moves again.
too aggressive?
i don't mix with the boys. i work here. let's keep it professional.
i'm special.
yes. i'll give you that!
give me a break, i'm asking you out.
i can't.
i thought there was something... that night in the club...
lieutenant...
evan... or maverick.
maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
the what?
some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
what are you talking about?
you turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
i'm not your foe. charlie and if he's harmless, you disengage.
harmless!
uh hum.
what if he's not?
you have to shoot him down....if he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
and probably never again. it's nothing personal. it's just...i know a lot of pilots. maybe i'm immune...
don't worry, i'm a new strain. and i don't give up. everything i've ever wanted i've had to work like hell for. well, how about it?
how about what?
how about anything, anything you want to do.
hard to argue with that, isn't it...
a date... coffee... a drink...a walk in the park.
what about the plane?
what plane.
most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. maverick well, get used to it.
used to what?
i'm different.
i'm starting to sense that now.
let's make it at eight.
make what?
anything.
okay, anything. just...go. i've gotta work.
why'd you do that?

it dies. we live.
you're an animal.
that's true. what are you?
i don't enjoy watching things suffer.
no!
it's not suffering anymore.
you're horrible
you're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    things die. every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. every time you eat, something had to die.
you don't have to kill it.
somebody does. it's more honest this way. you do your own dirty work.
you ever think about killing another human being?
about as much as they think about killing me.
does it bother you?
they know the rules... that's the deal. that's why you're up there. it's him or me. that's the price of admission.  it bothers you, why? you're part of it.   everybody dies. most people don't get to die for something.
you know what really scares me? living too long. losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. and my brains...sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime tv.
you don't believe any of this. you don't think you'll ever die.
that's it, of course. when i'm up there and doing it, i'm cheating it every second. i'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. i'm skating the edge of it.
winston churchill.
what he said..."there's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
all you've got is one life. i guess it's worth about the same to every body. you ever see an old woman after her husband has died? and the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  when you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. that's your whole future. that's as far as it goes. but imagine what those seconds are worth.
what if you kill yourself? think of everything you'll miss. maverick there is lots of stuff i don't know about...  fine wine... great art... the opera. i guess if i live long enough, i'll get to it. if i don't, i'll never miss it.
are you really that brave?
i watched my mother die. cancer. she had a long time to think about it. they say you reach an agreement with death. come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. i didn't see that. she... was very brave...braver than i am. you go up there, there isn't time to think. if you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. simplifies funeral arrangements.
it's just as i thought.
what?
you're totally insane.
thanks very much.  care for some suchi?.
come on, we're next.
what?
come on, i got over six bucks on the line.
come on, come on! it's double or nothing.. we're talking twelve bucks american, here.
i've had enough...for now.
come on.
where?
you want to go ballistic?
i don't know. i don't like being out of control.
i always wanted to fly... ever since i first saw a jet. i wanted to fly jets, then i wanted f-14's, then i wanted to fly off carriers, then i wanted top gun.
and now?
and now i want you.
you always get what you want?
i don't know yet.
i want it understood.
anything.
no fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. by anyone.
why?
i'm a professional. you guys are in my line of work.
i wasn't thinking. i just did it.
big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
what the hell is this?
don't chew it, you won't have it that long. easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
i was a victim of circumstance.
they should have warned you about that one.
she's kinky for flight suits--said that she'd never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. the noise alone kept me up.
what'd you do?
pulled left, rolled out, underneath.
it's kind of ironic. all you guys have women troubles and i don't.
that's because you don't have any women.
until last night. did you see the moves i was making on that girl at the party?
the girl with the purple fingernails?
that's her--tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. it was great.
it was bad.
bad?
the girl with the purple fingernails was coogan's sister.
coogan spent half the night looking for her. he said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister.
i didn't ruin her.
you didn't help.
no, really. she came ruined!... ya think he knows it was me?
hear about ice?
what now?
he won again.
something bothering you?
nothing. let's just go fight.
morning, coogan.
how's it goin', coog?
stay with him! tighten your turn!
bogey at three o'clock high! nose on!
snapshot..missed him..
engaging the other guy. wood, you're on your own.
just cover wood, maverick. mutual support, man!
i'm gonna take him, goose.
don't be greedy. stay with wood.
i want him!
what what are you doing? we're cover!
wood's okay. i want viper.
walked right into it.
not only that, but zorro got your wingman. nice going.
twenty years' experience, i couldn't shake you. you may be a great flyer. i mean that.
i lost.
of course you did. i said a great flyer, not a smart one. you fly reckless. great instincts. no discipline. that ambush today, you followed your emotions instead of your wingman. of course you got killed...and well deserved to. it was a really stupid mistake. in battle, it gets people killed.
i can take care of myself.
talent is no holy shield. von richtofen was killed by a farm boy. instincts are not enough. do it our way. we've worked these things out. the good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    why do you have to do everything the hard way?
it's my own way. it works for me. i don't care about the rest of that stuff.
then why are you here?
for the same reason you are.
oh, you mean the thrill!
the flying. the fighting.  i'd go up there ten times a day to fight. i'd win at least nine of them. that's all i want to do. it's what i do best. i am real good.  just give me the jet.
relationships are a bitch, here. it's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. having a woman here is asking for it.
i guess that's what i'm doing, then.
where do you find the time? where do you find the energy. it's tough enough to keep your mind on school. a woman here is a real pain in the...
food...and you...my f-14!
in that order?
well no...inverse order.
i'm still second best.
you ever fly an f-14?
i don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.
danger?
. yeah!
doesn't it ever bother you?
why, what's gonna happen?
lucky charm.
what do you take me for? it's a navy cross.
just good luck.
where'd you get it.
pawn shop. what's to eat?
engaging bandit 12 o'clock.
shit!!
come off right--come off high--i'm in--i'll engage.
stay where you are. he's mine. i'm engaged. i'm in.
get out of there, you're unsafe. get out of there.
fire, or clear out, ice.
get lost!
you got too much nose to tail -- i'm coming in.
it's my shot.
come off--come off right. i'm on my way in. you go free, i'm engaging.
stay out of it. stay out of it, maverick.
you can't shoot him, i can. i'm in.
ice, roll off, i can shoot him.
no, no, no, he's mine.
if you can't shoot him, i can.
no, i got him. i can take him.
i'm pinned to the panel.
time to go.
i can't eject.
3000 feet. i'll do it.
go ahead. i can't reach. 2000 feet!
1000.
let's go. eject.
how do you feel?
all right.
goose is dead.
i know. i was there.
he was...my responsibility--my rio.
my first squadron in vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. ten guys. the first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
...they say you're alright.
i'm fine.
this is it, then.
what?
the dark side. the price you pay for all the fun you're having. you knew about it, of course. didn't you?
he was a friend of mine. a good guy...great guy. it was my fault.
that's not what i hear.
i was flying...my responsibility.
that's what you get flight pay for.
maybe i shouldn't take it.
why? you act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
not to me.
you knew it. you all do. it's part of it. maybe the most important part.
where are we?
where are we? you know where we are. it's called the beach. it's where life first crawled up out of the sea. i come here sometimes... when i feel like crawling back in.
you don't have to do this.
do what, show you a good time?
i'm not good company. i should be alone.
i don't think so, but if that's what you want...
no.
what do you want?
i want it back.
what?
yesterday.
you look way out there. out past the date line. west becomes east, all things change. you cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, i forget which.
that's what i want.
of course the line's just imaginary. you can cross it twenty times...nothing really changes.
you don't believe that.
hardly ever.
only when you're depressed. then it passes.
it does.
everything passes. immutable law of the universe.
what do you do when you come here?
i sit. i think. i play games.
what kind of games?
i like to play "reality".
how do you play reality.
it's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
strip reality! how do you play that?
it's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  one person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
you're crazy.  that's a pretty silly game.
not as silly as some. you know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. that we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
want to play the game?
how does it go?
you say the truth.  go ahead. don't be afraid. you want to win the game, don'tcha?
what truth?
the big one. the one that's most on your mind.
goose is dead.
true.
now?
take something off.
off me or off you?
that's up to you.
what does it mean?
that wasn't fair. it was a question. penalty round!
you didn't mean it. you didn't think. you'd do anything to take it back.
that's three.
and that's one!
one more.
your watch.
looks like a tie.
who's gonna win?
we'll say it together. on the count of three...one...two...
what? where're you--hey, where in the hell are you going?
didn't ... ahhh...look good.
what do you mean? it doesn't get to look much better than that?
no. no good.
he just won't engage. he can't do it, skipper. he can't get back on the horse.
it's only been a week. keep sending him up.
i've seen this before.
so have i.
some guys never get it back.
what are you doing?
saving them some paperwork.
since when did you care about paperwork?
if i could fly like you i'd have everything i want. if i could fly at all. i can't fly. i can't fly like that. nobody can. whatever it is, you've got it!
not anymore.
so, you're scared--so what? you ever get a good look at me in the back seat, i'm goddamn terrified.
you weren't gonna say goodbye?
i was, later.
long distance? i wouldn't do that to you. i'd at least talk to you.
i didn't want to see you. i mean, i did...but i didn't..
i know exactly what you mean.
how could you?
i've got a gift just like you do. my gift is i just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. it helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. like what you just said was "i'm embarrassed, i feel i've done something wrong, that i've failed, and i don't think i can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." that about it?
...something like that.
and i'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until i can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
hey, i never said i was a fighter pilot...i never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. i can find contentment in a good book. i don't have to roar by someone at mach two with my hair on fire. sometimes...i just get happy being with the right man.
i hope you find him.
i think i have... i could be wrong. i have been before. just remember one thing. if you're not top gun, if you're not fighting jets, you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot... you're gonna have to act like the rest of us. you're gonna have to master humility. for you guys, that's the toughest maneuver of all.
skipper, sorry to bother you.
no bother.
i called your house.
my wife's house.
she said you took your kid to the each. every second sunday. zoo or beach or the ballgame. y'have the option... what about me?
we can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "cnc" --course not completed, no explanation required. theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
or....
or you can quit.
i don't know...
i didn't know either. that's why i told jester to prepare your papers.
it's no disgrace, kid. that spin was hell. it would wreck anyone's confidence. you could be a good pilot again someday...
you think i should quit?!
i didn't say that. that's up to you. but i have responsibility for the other guys up there, not just you. they need to know you're all right...that they can depend on you.
sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... i served with your old man.
i know.
vf 51, the oriskany. you remind me of him. you're just like he was, only better...and worse.
i'm nothing like him.
you may not think so, but you are.
he was by the book, all the way.
they waved him off. he thought he knew better. he hit the ramp.
i never heard that.
not something they tell dependents.
it's not true.
how can i go on? i feel so... responsible.
kid, the plain fact is...you are. i'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. technically, they absolved you. you and i know what really happened. you pushed it. you are responsible and you'll always carry that. you know what, i'll carry it too. i should have taken you out of that cockpit. i guess i'm a hopeless romantic... i always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. it's no trade-off. it's not one for one. what you learned isn't worth his death. it couldn't be. but maybe there is some value in it. i know it's the first thing i've ever seen that's really gotten to you. now the question is, what will you do with it. if it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. that's one good thing. you were an accident waiting to happen.
you think i shouldn't fly.
i didn't say that. that's up to you. i think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
would you take me back? would they?
i'll have to think about it. i don't know about them. i do know one thing, we've got a lot invested in you. we'd hate to lose it. even more than those other guys, naval aviation needs a very few, very good men.
i've got two more bogeys coming in at four o'clock high.
got 'em.
bandit at seven o'clock low--solo. take him. pull on the goddamn stick, man!
okay, okay.
don't tell me okay. do it!
break left! break left!   chaff! flares!
breaking left!
okay, going up. ice, go high.
look out!
on the nose?
got 'em. got good tone.
there's another one up there!
i got one coming up.
and he's gunning.
ohhh mother!
goddamnit, mav, you really are a slow learner. don't worry, fung, i've got it.
don't worry!!!?   you've got it!!? are you crazy?
roger, i've got it.
now have you got it?  have you still got it?
yawing right.
i know!
rudder's left, stick's forward.
swell! passing ten thousand!
i've got it -- hold on!
passing 8. passing 6. lock your harness!
i can recover. hold on!
5000 feet. speed two hundred.
okay.
no! not again!
what are you talking about, we gotta go!
i'm not losing it again!
gotta go, man.
280, 290, 300 knots.
3,000 feet.  we gotta go, man. 3,000 feet, we gotta go!
you go. i'm staying with it.
i'm gonna go! three...two...one...
i got a winder left, but no good tone on it.
i can't lose him, can you get off a shot?
i got no tone. it might get you.
what choice do i have?   shoot it.
when i shoot, you break left..3..2
is there something i should know?
just relax.
is it the plane?
the plane is fine.
is it you?
yeah, i guess it is. we did it! we did it...damn! we sure did it!
you're not supposed to...
but i have to!
then...shit! go ahead. i'm right behind you.
mustang, this is maverick, request a flyby.
i guess i owe you one.
you don't owe me anything. we're on the same team.
you saved our lives. you did it!
we did it.
you're a hell of a flyer.  you can be my wingman any time.
no. you can be mine!
you hear that? anything we want. anything...well???
well what?
what do you want?
what do i want?
what do you want?
any more migs?
who's the hell is that?
three guesses.
well, he's in trouble and he didn't even get here yet.
let me do the talking.
oh, no. you did the flying, i'll do the talking!
well?
well what?
you got your f-14, you got top gun, you got your migs....you're our new top gun instructor...now what?
oh...i'll think of something... what are you doing here?
i live here, remember?
right on the flight line?
