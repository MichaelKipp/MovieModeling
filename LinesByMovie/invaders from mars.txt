what's the story on jimmy gardner?
gardner?  oh, um -- he's a new student. just moved here.  why?
his teacher brought him in to see me. said he'd been acting up in class. creating a disturbance.  i couldn't get a thing out of him.
oh?
what's his family background?
they're from out of state.  father's an engineer at the nuclear power plant. i really don't know much about them.
this is a new town for you.  do you like it here?
no.
why not?  moving is hard for anybody.  was it hard for you to leave all your friends?
i don't have many friends.  dad's all the time moving.
can you tell me about that?
son ... are you awake?
yes.
we're going to be moving, son.
do we have to?
i know, son.  but you'll like it where we're going.  i'm getting a good job.  it's a pretty part of the country.
i'll have to go to a new school -- again.
you'll meet new friends.  i know ... it's rough.  but i have to move, son.
what's that, dad?
that's the air force base.
wow.  look at the mountains.
this can be your room if you want it. what do you say?
is the hill ours too?
if we want it, it is.
let's check it out, dad.
wow.  there's the town.  and there's the air base.  this is a great hill.
it's got a name.  copper ridge. there used to be a copper mine near here.
let's see what's on the other side. maybe we'll find some copper.
a meteorite, dad, look!
it's that time of year again. we should get a pretty good show out here.
why, dad?
because the sky is so clear out here.
there are more this year than last.
this should be the heaviest shower of the year.
there's cassius ...
... and rigel.
and that one -- to the right of rigel?
which one's that?  the dull, red one.
that's mars.  the closest planet to us, now.  that's why it's more than just a point in the sky.
well, come on, you two.  time to go to bed.
mom -- this is the best show all year.
i know.  but you have a full day of school tomorrow --  you, too.
well, son?  should we call it a night?  i for one have had a long day.
okay.
jim -- what's wrong?!
you've got to come see -- a big thing went down over the hill!
it was big -- and it glowed -- and it went down over there -- behind the hill.
what did it look like?
it was -- it was -- it changed shape. first it was big and round, then it was flat, then it was long and thin.
are you sure you saw that?  in the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
i don't know, dad.  but it was big.
i'll go take a look when the rain lets off.
what do you think he saw?  could it have been something from the air base?
no, mom.  it wasn't a plane.
are you all right, dad?
sure ... fine.
george, where have you been?
what happened to your other slipper?
i lost it.  it's kind of muddy out there.
was there anything over the hill?
your father asked you a question.
what? -- i...
i have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. this house needs just <u>everything</u>. i'll probably be gone all day. jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
i'll take you to school.
you don't have to.  the school bus stops right outside here, at 7:30. i've got to run.
it's probably the solenoid.  take it back to gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
i will.  but isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
hi.  sorry i'm late.
the back door was open.
what happened to you?  who was that?
that's ed.  ed works with the bell telephone switching division.
where's your car?
i left it at work.
you did?  why? where were you? they said you left hours ago. we were worried.
i'm home now.
yes -- but ...
you know, it really is beautiful up there.  let me show you.  we'll take a walk after dinner.
george, you're acting very strangely.
mom.  i gotta talk to you.
what?
don't go over the hill, mom. please.
what's wrong, ellen?
it's his nightmare.  he still hasn't gotten over it ... about the other side of the hill.
when?
this afternoon.  it's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
i have school.
i'll pack us a lunch.  hamburgers. you always like that, don't you.
that's quite a story.  you know that, don't you?
yes.
a ufo lands in back of your house and puts something in your dad and mom's necks.  then it gets the police, and your teacher too.
how did it get mrs. mckeltch?
she said the frog came from around the copper ridge.  she must've been behind the hill.
what would you think if somebody told you a story like this?
i'd believe him.
why?
'cause he wouldn't lie.
ms. magnuson, is jimmy gardner with you?
why, yes.
jimmy's father is on the phone.  i wonder if you'd take the call.
all right.  i'll be right back.
hello, this is ms. magnuson speaking.
i understand, miss, that you have my son in your office.
yes, i do, mr. gardner.
may i ask why?
we were having a little talk.
about what?
children often have trouble adjusting to a new school.
i don't know what he's told you --  what <u>has</u> he told you?  would you like to tell <u>me</u> -- ?
mr. gardner, i --
you people have a lot of nerve, taking it on yourselves to encourage young children to speak out of turn. i'm of a mind to pull him out of school if this is your idea of how to handle ... what sort of training do you have anyway?
mr. gardner, i don't think this is the place to discuss this matter.
i'm not particularly interested, <u>ms.</u> magnuson, in what you think is correct. my wife and i are going away on a business trip this afternoon and we want jimmy with us.  keep him in your office until we arrive.
of course.
we'll be by to pick him up in ten minutes.
yes, mr. gardner.
do you know how to follow a map?
yes.  i can even read star maps.
this shows how to get to my home. i'm giving you back roads and footpaths, so there's less chance of you being seen.
what do you mean -- gone?  what the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
i'm sorry, mr. gardner.  i was out of my office for a minute and when i got back -- he was gone.
what did he talk to you about?
he was upset with moving, i believe.
is that all he said?
why, yes.  why?
jimmy, calm down!  what happened? tell me what happened!
i got trapped in mrs. mckeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house.  i saw them.
where, jimmy?
behind my house, up on the ridge.
if we go and look and there's nothing there, you'll have to admit to me that this is all in your mind.
this is where it was -- the tunnel opening.
i don't see anything.
no, but it was here.
i swear it was here.
but it's not, jimmy.
no.
let's go look at the sand pit behind your house.
they'll get us.
we'll be very careful.  but we have to see.  if something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. wouldn't there?
does it look to you like anything landed here?
maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
stay here.  i'm going to make a phone call.
who are you calling?
the state police.
did you call the state police?
all their lines were busy.
no one comes here after dark.
hide the car.
damn.
i know a way.
what is it?
i don't know.  i don't know what i'm doing here --
but you saw -- the men go under the sand ...
yes ... yes, but i'm not sure what i saw anymore.
don't go in.
i'm not.  they must be tunneling under the whole town.
we can't do this alone.  we've got to get help.
there was a man named colonel wilson, from the air force base.  he was talking in our class.  he said we could visit him any time we wanted.  i'll bet he could do something.
let's try.
you're looking for life?
they didn't find any signs of life on the viking missions.
i had an awful dream.
what, jim, what?
first lemme look at your necks.
... and then everything blew up. and then i woke up.
that's a doozy of a dream, son.
it was so real, dad.
it was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days.  the sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
it's all this moving from place to place.  we're never settled.  i'm having nightmares myself.
what kind, mom?
oh, i can't remember.  but people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed.
i know, ellen.  we'll settle down soon.
i was so scared.
better now, son?
better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
good night.
