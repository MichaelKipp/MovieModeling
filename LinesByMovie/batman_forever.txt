mr...?
bruce wayne. in the flesh.
um...i'm pretty sure i'm bruce wayne. and you are?
nygma. edward nygma. you hired me. personally. just like i tell everyone.  well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
i'm gonna need that hand back, ed.
what? ah yes. of course. i'm sorry. it's just that...you're my idol.  and some people have been trying to keep us apart.
mr. nygma, you'll forgive me for being rude. but what exactly is on your mind?
precisely. what's on all our minds? brainwaves. the future of wayne enterprises is brainwaves!
i really do apologize, mr. wayne. his project was terminated this morning...
let me ask you something, bruce. what is man's greatest tool?
why be brutalized by an uncaring world? my res box will give joe q public a realm where he is king.  not that someone like you would need it. someone so intelligent. witty. charming. but for the lonely, the...
paranoid? the psychotic?
...the box can change their lives.  our stock coupons will spike.
hell. might even bring old stickley here a few extra bucks. huh, fred?
fred?
call my secretary, she'll set something up.  factory looks great, folks.  keep up the good work.
wait. you can't go.
we'll talk some other -
no. don't leave me! my invention! i need you!
_we_ sure are.
...you gonna kill me?
might. might not. could say we're of two minds on the subject.
i got family. ...please.
what say we flip for it?
...or death.
please. i swear i won't say noth-
the coin _wants_ to decide.
that floor has got to be very hard. is that better?
uh, yeah. thanks, mr..uh...face.
just call us harvey. can we get you a sandwich? a soft drink? given all the trouble we caused you, how about we cut you in for a share of tonight's haul?
_two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _second_ bank of gotham on the _22nd_ how could harvey? _two_-face resist?
and you are?
...dual personalities. abnormal psychology. washington's poster child for the criminally insane. i read your work.
i'm flattered. not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  you might have some interesting insights into two-face.
why's that?
let's just say i could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
bats aren't rodents, dr. meridian.
i didn't know that. see? you _are_ interesting. and call me chase. by the way, do you have a first name? or do i just call you bats?
wait! you said you'd let me go!
never heard of a double-cross?
i'll show you it works.
what the hell is going on here?
yo. charlie. gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. extra well done. hold the neurons.  patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject.  riddle me this, fred. what is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? your mind of course. and now mine pumps with the power of yours.  new from brain-bok. da pump. think faster. reason higher. out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. da pump. yeah.  ho! mark. i sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. the acrostic. the crypto-graphic. what doth this bode? answer me marcutio, you little runt.  fred, i must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. simply divine. but now i yearn for a meal of substance. the main course. a wide and varied palette. ah, to taste the mind of a hero. a nobleman. a poet.  a chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either.
...fired...your fired...your fired. you understand?! fired!!
i don't think so.
the dreams again, sir?
i think they're getting worse.
it's a wonder you sleep at all.
...would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
then you'd have nothing to complain about.
hardly a worry, sir.
how's the sonar coming, alfred?
a few hitches sir, but i'm confident we'll have a prototype in no time.
it'll never work.
i believe you said the same thing about the batmobile.
scholarly research?
she has an excellent mind.
if i misinterpreted your interest in the lady, i humbly apologize--
i wonder if she'd go out with me.
apology hastily retracted.
do you remember the night i fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
your parents' wake. rain fell like tears.
...the night batman was born.  what was i doing in the fields that night, alfred? what sent me running out into that storm? i keep dreaming about it but i just can't remember.
i don't know, sir. your dear parents.  suddenly gone. so much loss...
i remember the bat, though. his scream. those eyes. i was sure the fear would kill me.  in time i came to believe that if i became a monster, that if i was feared, i wouldn't be scared anymore. i was wrong.  they think i became batman to fight crime. i became batman to fight the fear. and instead i became the fear.
how can i help you, mr. wayne?
somebody's been sending me love letters. commissioner gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
psychiatrists make you nervous?
just ones this beautiful.
the infamous wayne charm. does it ever shut off?
on occasion. usually at night.
still play with dolls, doctor?
she's a malaysian dream warden. she stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  need one?
me? no. only things that need calming in my dreams are the rockettes.
my opinion. this letter writer is a total wacko.
wacko? that a technical term?
patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. work better for you?
so what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
exactly.
i think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
so, this riddler, he's dangerous?
what do you know about obsession?
not much.
it's a stretch but i'll manage.
the letter writer is obsessed with you. his only escape may be...
to kill me.
you understand obsession better than you let on.
no insights here, doc. just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  oops. times up.
that's usually my line.
look, i'd love to keep chatting-
would you? i'm not so sure.
but i'm going to have to get you out of those clothes.
excuse me.
and into a black dress.
i'm surprised you aren't blind by now.
i'm sorry. who are you?
like normal folks.
what? this isn't normal?
that kid is amazing.
i don't get you bruce wayne.
me? i'm easy. especially after a couple of martinis.
the glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
don't believe it. i'm just skin deep.
look, i'm rock climbing sunday. how about coming along?
bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
but...
well, i met someone...
fast work. you just moved here.
you could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. i think he felt it too.
he sure did.
what?
i said i'm sure he did.
welcome, master grayson. i'm alfred.
how ya doin', al?
al?
big house. how many rooms?
gee, i'm not sure.  alfred? how many rooms? total?
ninety-three, including the sauna.
take any three you like. after you get settled we can...
okay. i'm outta here.
excuse me.
i figure telling that cop i'd stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. so no offense but thanks. see ya.
where will you go? the circus is halfway to metropolis by now.
i got no place at the circus without my family. i'm going to get a fix on two-face. then i'm going to kill him.
listen, dick. killing two-face won't take the pain away. it'll make it worse.
look, spare me the sermons, okay. you're just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. you don't even know me.
it's happening again. just like my parents. a monster comes out of the night. a scream. two gunshots. i killed them.
what did you say?
he killed them. two-face. he slaughtered that boy's parents.
no. you said i. i killed them.
don't be ridiculous.
he's home. i sent the signal.
what's wrong?
last night at the circus. i noticed something about dent. his coin. he's obsessed with justice. it's his achilles' heel. it can be exploited.
i wish i could say my interest in you was purely professional...
are you trying to get under my cape, doctor?
a girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
it's the car, right? chicks love the car.
what is it about the wrong kind of man? in grade school it was guys with earrings. college, motorcycles and leather jackets.
now black rubber.
try a fireman. less to take off.
i don't mind the work. pity i can't see behind the mask.
we all wear masks.
my life's an open book. you read?
i'm not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
we could give it a try. i'll bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
you are direct, aren't you?
you like strong women. i've done my homework. or do i need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
i haven't had much luck with women...
maybe you just haven't met the right woman...
how'd you find us?
you _are_ two-face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. only one spot in gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
congratulations. you get to die on the dean's list.
yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  it's so you.  and yet so _you_!  very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. but you pull it off nicely.
a man with a death wish.
harvey. you need me. since you've gotten out of arkham, you've managed, what? to bungle stealing a safe? wreck a statue? and, correct me if i'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
let's see if you bleed green.
holy shit.
so not everyone can be a poet. still, i respect the sentiment.
no.  wait...
addictive isn't it? just say no. until i say yes. a little fringe benefit of working with me. now here's the concept, counselor. crime. my i.q., your ak-47. you help me gather production capital so i can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse bruce wayne's forever. and, in return i will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. who is batman?
may i help you, master grayson?
how come this is the only locked door around this museum? what's back there?
master wayne's dead wives.
where are you sending batboy this time?
here. get a good seat.
sure, e = mc squared. until you factor in more than three dimensions. then... damn. hit us again.
haven't you had enough? don't think and drive.
not until you do that thing i like.  on se tue pour des mesnonges. j'ai gache ma vie...  woah. harsh toke.
don't bogart that 'trode.
oh my god. jim morrison was right.
about what?
everything.
up here, al.
just checking, young sir.
four seconds from...
the style of the letters i'm getting matches those found at the crime sites. why would the riddler be sending me riddles?  who's your decorator? u-haul?
sorry. i haven't even had time to unpack. instant coffee okay?
a lot of what happened is jagged. pieces missing. i can't really remember. i just get flashes. usually in my dreams. i'd kind of gotten used to them. at least accepted them....
and now....
they've changed. the dreams, i mean. there's a new element i don't understand. a book. black. covered in leather....
find anything interesting?
why do i feel like the other man, here?
come on, bruce. this is what i do for a living.
i'd say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
what do you want me to say? that i'm not attracted to him?
why do you do that?
what?
throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. if you're jealous...
i'm not-
you want me close but you won't let me near. what's the terrible, dark secret you're protecting everyone from?
in a sense we are all two people. the side we show in daylight. and that side we keep in shadow.
rage. anger. passion. pain.
sorry to bother you, sir. i have some rather distressing news about master dick.
is he all right?
i'm afraid master dick has... gone traveling.
he ran away?
actually, he took the car.
he boosted the jag?  is that all?
not the jaguar. the _other_ car.
the _rolls_?
_no_, sir. _the_ _other_ _car_!
i need to be part of this.
absolutely not.
me and my brother chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. dad's knee was going. chris was engaged, you know that? two-face took...everything. now i can pay him back.
what i do isn't about revenge.
back off, man.
you don't understand. it's an addiction. you fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. but the pain's back in the morning. and somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  i want better for you.
save the sermons about how great you want my life to be, okay, bruce? if it weren't for batman my parents wouldn't be dead. you don't get it, do you? this is all your fault.
too much wealth. too fast. half of gotham zombied-out. a technology that self destructs. he's protecting more than industrial secrets, alfred.
i shall be near at hand. should you need me. and sir, i know it's difficult but try and have a good time.
if i didn't know better, i'd say you were sulking.
keep me off the couch, doc. your fees are a little rich for me.
touchy, touchy.
so how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of batman?
oh god, bruce. you're still jealous.
spare me the diagnosis, okay? you're being ridiculous. i can't be jealous of batman.  can i?
so glad you could come.
what? oh, edward. hi. congratulations. great party-
the press were just wondering what it feels like to be outsold, outclassed, and generally outdone in every way...  and what light through yonder window breaks? `tis the east. and you are...
chase?
of course you are. and what a grand pursuit you must be.  what do you think of my new invention?
what? oh, it's very impressive.
gracious even in defeat. how vaguely disappointing. when all this could have been ours together.
no grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. but we make due. to your charms.  skol.
nostrovia.
la'chiem.
slanta.
rinka.
banzai.
i notice you've sub-divided your b coupons. feeling a little light on principle?
actually, i like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
and the beast slouches towards bethelem.
excuse me, boys. i'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
what the hell did you think you were doing?
you have a real gratitude problem. you know that, bruce? i need a name. batboy? the dark earl? what's a good side kick name?
how about richard grayson, college student?
...i missed two-face by a heartbeat. when we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
we don't kill. killing is what damns you. it-. what am i talking about? this conversation is over. you're going away to school.
i saved your life. you owe me. so either you let me be your partner or i'm going after harvey on my own.
maybe they're right.
which `they' might that be, sir?
jack napier's dead. my parents are avenged. the wayne foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs.
why do i keep doing this?
why, indeed?
could i let batman go? for dick. for me. could i leave the shadows? have a life. friends. family...
dr. meridian...
she's the first woman in a long time that's... no. she's the first woman ever. and she loves batman. not bruce wayne. if i let go of batman i'll lose her.
perhaps. perhaps not. why not ask the lady?
how? as batman, knowing she wants me? or as bruce wayne and hope...?
why do we need you? you only come between us. we can be the smartest person in gotham city. we want the empire for ourselves. time's up, laughing boy.
kill me? well, alright. go ahead. take the empire. all yours.  hell, harv, old pals. i'll kill me for you.
go ahead. you can say it.
you're a genius.
you can't-.
dick, let go. revenge will eat you alive. trust me. i know.
but what about all the good we can do? there are monsters out there. gotham needs us.
and when you finally get two-face?
exactly. and once you'd killed him you'd be lost. like me.  all this has to be a choice. otherwise...it's a curse.
bruce, you can't.
chase is coming for dinner. why don't you join us.
there's something i want to talk with you about. it's...well, we.. i...
okay, tiger, take it slow. you going to give me your pin or something?
your memories are repressed. they're trying to break through. relax. try to remember-.
i don't want to remember!
stop fighting.
my parents are laid out in the library. their skin smells like talcum powder. i'm so small. my father's diary is on his desk like always. i'm opening the book. reading. i'm running out into the storm. the book is in my hands. i can't hear my screams over the rain. i'm falling...
what does it say? what hurts so much, bruce? what does the book say?
i don't-.
you do know. try.
the last entry read, bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  bruce insists. i made them go out. i made them take me to the movie. to that theater...  it was my fault. i killed them.
oh god, bruce, you were a child. you weren't responsible.
...not the bat?
what?
i always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. but it wasn't. the real fear was hiding underneath: what i read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. that's what i couldn't remember. that's the crime i've been paying for all these years.
what are you talking about?
chase. there's something i need to tell you--
we want to dust him. we truly want to dust him bad.
oh yes, and certainly _we_ will!
how are you feeling, young man?
not that young. it's been a long time since you've called me that.
old habits die hard. are you alright?
as well as can be expected, i guess. give me the bad news.
dick has run away. they have taken dr. meridian. and i'm afraid they found the cave, sir. it's been destroyed.
i'm batman? i remember my life as bruce wayne.  but all this. it's like the life of a stranger.
perhaps the fall...
there's one other thing. i feel..
what?
...afraid.
bruce. son. listen to me. you are a kind man. a strong man. but in truth you are not the most sane man.
...a bat.
what?
i remember a bat. a monster. a demon. chasing me.  oh my god, alfred.
no demons, son.  your monsters are here. until you fact that, i fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
master, bruce?
...batman, alfred. i'm batman.
all the answers are numbers.
but 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. what do they mean?
what do maniacs always want?
recognition, of course.
precisely. so this number is probably some kind of calling card.
letters in the alphabet.
of course. 13 is m....mre.
how about, mr. e.
mystery.
and another name for mystery?
enigma.
exactly. mr. e. mister edward nygma.
what now sir?
claw island. nygma's headquarters. i'm sure that's where they're keeping chase.  are all the batsuits destroyed?
all except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. but it hasn't yet been tested.
tonight's a good night.
a-14.
miss.
b-12.
a miss. and my favorite vitamin, i might add.
a hit.
you sunk my battleship.
welcome to my parlor said the riddler to the bat. how's tricks?
no more tricks, edward. release chase and dick. this is between you and me.
death.  death. without taste, sound and all around us.  because there is no way for me to save them or myself. this is one giant death trap.
excellent. see. who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? well, it's been grand. sorry you all have to die now.
wait. i have a riddle for you.
for _me_? really? tell me.
i see without seeing. to me, darkness is as clear as daylight. what am i?
oh please. you're blind as a bat.
exactly!
help chase. i'll be back.
did two-face call him bruce?
edward...
who is it?
it's dr. meridian. chase. do you remember me?
how could i forget?
dr. burton tells me you know who batman is.
yesssssss. i know!
who is the batman, edward?
can't tell if you don't say please.
you're right, edward. i didn't mean to be impolite. please.
