mr...?
bruce wayne. in the flesh.
um...i'm pretty sure I am bruce wayne. and you are?
nygma. edward nygma. you hired me. personally. just like i tell everyone.  well, we have never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
I am going to need that hand back, ed.
what? ah yes. of course. I am sorry. it is just that...you're my idol.  and some people have been trying to keep us apart.
mr. nygma, you will forgive me for being rude. but what exactly is on your mind?
precisely. what is on all our minds? brainwaves. the future of wayne enterprises is brainwaves!
i really do apologize, mr. wayne. his project was terminated this morning...
let me ask you something, bruce. what is man's greatest tool?
why be brutalized by an uncaring world? my res box will give joe q public a realm where he is king.  not that someone like you would need it. someone so intelligent. witty. charming. but for the lonely, the...
paranoid? the psychotic?
...the box can change their lives.  our stock coupons will spike.
hell. might even bring old stickley here a few extra bucks. huh, fred?
fred?
call my secretary, she will set something up.  factory looks great, folks.  keep up the good work.
wait. you can not go.
we will talk some other -
no. do not leave me! my invention! i need you!
_we_ sure are.
...you gonna kill me?
might. might not. could say we are of two minds on the subject.
i got family. ...please.
what say we flip for it?
...or death.
please. i swear i will not say noth-
the coin _wants_ to decide.
that floor has got to be very hard. is that better?
uh, yeah. thanks, mr..uh...face.
just call us harvey. can we get you a sandwich? a soft drink? given all the trouble we caused you, how about we cut you in for a share of tonight's haul?
_two_ million dollars waiting to be transferred from the _second_ bank of gotham on the _22nd_ how could harvey? _two_-face resist?
and you are?
...dual personalities. abnormal psychology. washington's poster child for the criminally insane. i read your work.
I am flattered. not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  you might have some interesting insights into two-face.
why is that?
let's just say i could write a hell of a paper on a grown man who dresses like a flying rodent.
bats are not rodents, dr. meridian.
i did not know that. see? you _are_ interesting. and call me chase. by the way, do you have a first name? or do i just call you bats?
wait! you said you would let me go!
never heard of a double-cross?
I will show you it works.
what the hell is going on here?
yo. charlie. gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. extra well done. hold the neurons.  patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject.  riddle me this, fred. what is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? your mind of course. and now mine pumps with the power of yours.  new from brain-bok. da pump. think faster. reason higher. out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. da pump. yeah.  ho! mark. i sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. the acrostic. the crypto-graphic. what doth this bode? answer me marcutio, you little runt.  fred, i must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. simply divine. but now i yearn for a meal of substance. the main course. a wide and varied palette. ah, to taste the mind of a hero. a nobleman. a poet.  a chick in a short skirt would not be so bad either.
...fired...your fired...your fired. you understand?! fired!!
i do not think so.
the dreams again, sir?
i think they are getting worse.
it is a wonder you sleep at all.
...would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
then you would have nothing to complain about.
hardly a worry, sir.
how is the sonar coming, alfred?
a few hitches sir, but I am confident we will have a prototype in no time.
it will never work.
i believe you said the same thing about the batmobile.
scholarly research?
she has an excellent mind.
if i misinterpreted your interest in the lady, i humbly apologize--
i wonder if she would go out with me.
apology hastily retracted.
do you remember the night i fell into that cave and the bat chased me?
your parents' wake. rain fell like tears.
...the night batman was born.  what was i doing in the fields that night, alfred? what sent me running out into that storm? i keep dreaming about it but i just can not remember.
i do not know, sir. your dear parents.  suddenly gone. so much loss...
i remember the bat, though. his scream. those eyes. i was sure the fear would kill me.  in time i came to believe that if i became a monster, that if i was feared, i would not be scared anymore. i was wrong.  they think i became batman to fight crime. i became batman to fight the fear. and instead i became the fear.
how can i help you, mr. wayne?
somebody is been sending me love letters. commissioner gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
psychiatrists make you nervous?
just ones this beautiful.
the infamous wayne charm. does it ever shut off?
on occasion. usually at night.
still play with dolls, doctor?
she is a malaysian dream warden. she stands sentry while you sleep and calms your dreams.  need one?
me? no. only things that need calming in my dreams are the rockettes.
my opinion. this letter writer is a total wacko.
wacko? that a technical term?
patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. work better for you?
so what you are saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
exactly.
i think the question would be, do you have a thing for bats?
so, this riddler, he is dangerous?
what do you know about obsession?
not much.
it is a stretch but I will manage.
the letter writer is obsessed with you. his only escape may be...
to kill me.
you understand obsession better than you let on.
no insights here, doc. just trying to get comfortable on your couch.  oops. times up.
that is usually my line.
look, I would love to keep chatting-
would you? I am not so sure.
but I am going to have to get you out of those clothes.
excuse me.
and into a black dress.
I am surprised you are not blind by now.
I am sorry. who are you?
like normal folks.
what? this is not normal?
that kid is amazing.
i do not get you bruce wayne.
me? I am easy. especially after a couple of martinis.
the glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, is not it?
do not believe it. I am just skin deep.
look, I am rock climbing sunday. how about coming along?
bruce, much to my surprise, you seem like a really great guy...
but...
well, i met someone...
fast work. you just moved here.
you could say he kind of dropped out of the sky and bang-. i think he felt it too.
he sure did.
what?
i said I am sure he did.
welcome, master grayson. I am alfred.
how ya doin', al?
al?
big house. how many rooms?
gee, I am not sure.  alfred? how many rooms? total?
ninety-three, including the sauna.
take any three you like. after you get settled we can...
okay. I am outta here.
excuse me.
i figure telling that cop I would stay here saved me a truckload of social service interviews and good will. so no offense but thanks. see ya.
where will you go? the circus is halfway to metropolis by now.
i got no place at the circus without my family. I am going to get a fix on two-face. then I am going to kill him.
listen, dick. killing two-face will not take the pain away. it will make it worse.
look, spare me the sermons, okay. you are just some rich guy who is trying to do a good deed. you do not even know me.
it is happening again. just like my parents. a monster comes out of the night. a scream. two gunshots. i killed them.
what did you say?
he killed them. two-face. he slaughtered that boy's parents.
no. you said i. i killed them.
do not be ridiculous.
he is home. i sent the signal.
what is wrong?
last night at the circus. i noticed something about dent. his coin. he is obsessed with justice. it is his achilles' heel. it can be exploited.
i wish i could say my interest in you was purely professional...
are you trying to get under my cape, doctor?
a girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
it is the car, right? chicks love the car.
what is it about the wrong kind of man? in grade school it was guys with earrings. college, motorcycles and leather jackets.
now black rubber.
try a fireman. less to take off.
i do not mind the work. pity i can not see behind the mask.
we all wear masks.
my life's an open book. you read?
I am not the kind of guy who blends in at a family picnic.
we could give it a try. I will bring the wine, you bring the scarred psyche.
you are direct, are not you?
you like strong women. I have done my homework. or do i need skin-tight vinyl and a whip?
i have not had much luck with women...
maybe you just have not met the right woman...
how did you find us?
you _are_ two-face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. only one spot in gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
congratulations. you get to die on the dean's list.
yet so bright and chipper and conservative!  it is so you.  and yet so _you_!  very few people are both a summer _and_ a winter. but you pull it off nicely.
a man with a death wish.
harvey. you need me. since you have gotten out of arkham, you have managed, what? to bungle stealing a safe? wreck a statue? and, correct me if I am wrong here, but were not you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
let's see if you bleed green.
holy shit.
so not everyone can be a poet. still, i respect the sentiment.
no.  wait...
addictive is not it? just say no. until i say yes. a little fringe benefit of working with me. now here's the concept, counselor. crime. my i.q., your ak-47. you help me gather production capital so i can produce enough of these  to create an empire that will eclipse bruce wayne's forever. and, in return i will help you solve the greatest riddle of all. who is batman?
may i help you, master grayson?
how come this is the only locked door around this museum? what is back there?
master wayne's dead wives.
where are you sending batboy this time?
here. get a good seat.
sure, e = mc squared. until you factor in more than three dimensions. then... damn. hit us again.
have not you had enough? do not think and drive.
not until you do that thing i like.  on se tue pour des mesnonges. j'ai gache ma vie...  woah. harsh toke.
do not bogart that 'trode.
oh my god. jim morrison was right.
about what?
everything.
up here, al.
just checking, young sir.
four seconds from...
the style of the letters I am getting matches those found at the crime sites. why would the riddler be sending me riddles?  who is your decorator? u-haul?
sorry. i have not even had time to unpack. instant coffee okay?
a lot of what happened is jagged. pieces missing. i can not really remember. i just get flashes. usually in my dreams. I would kind of gotten used to them. at least accepted them....
and now....
they have changed. the dreams, i mean. there is a new element i do not understand. a book. black. covered in leather....
find anything interesting?
why do i feel like the other man, here?
come on, bruce. this is what i do for a living.
I would say this goes a little beyond taking your work home.
what do you want me to say? that I am not attracted to him?
why do you do that?
what?
throw up that ridiculous superficial mask. if you are jealous...
I am not-
you want me close but you will not let me near. what is the terrible, dark secret you are protecting everyone from?
in a sense we are all two people. the side we show in daylight. and that side we keep in shadow.
rage. anger. passion. pain.
sorry to bother you, sir. i have some rather distressing news about master dick.
is he all right?
I am afraid master dick has... gone traveling.
he ran away?
actually, he took the car.
he boosted the jag?  is that all?
not the jaguar. the _other_ car.
the _rolls_?
_no_, sir. _the_ _other_ _car_!
i need to be part of this.
absolutely not.
me and my brother chris were putting money aside so our folks could retire. dad's knee was going. chris was engaged, you know that? two-face took...everything. now i can pay him back.
what i do is not about revenge.
back off, man.
you do not understand. it is an addiction. you fight night after night, trying to fill the emptiness. but the pain's back in the morning. and somewhere along the way it stops being a choice.  i want better for you.
save the sermons about how great you want my life to be, okay, bruce? if it were not for batman my parents would not be dead. you do not get it, do you? this is all your fault.
too much wealth. too fast. half of gotham zombied-out. a technology that self destructs. he is protecting more than industrial secrets, alfred.
i shall be near at hand. should you need me. and sir, i know it is difficult but try and have a good time.
if i did not know better, I would say you were sulking.
keep me off the couch, doc. your fees are a little rich for me.
touchy, touchy.
so how goes your `scholarly' pursuit of batman?
oh god, bruce. you are still jealous.
spare me the diagnosis, okay? you are being ridiculous. i can not be jealous of batman.  can i?
so glad you could come.
what? oh, edward. hi. congratulations. great party-
the press were just wondering what it feels like to be outsold, outclassed, and generally outdone in every way...  and what light through yonder window breaks? `tis the east. and you are...
chase?
of course you are. and what a grand pursuit you must be.  what do you think of my new invention?
what? oh, it is very impressive.
gracious even in defeat. how vaguely disappointing. when all this could have been ours together.
no grape could be more intoxicating than you, my dear. but we make due. to your charms.  skol.
nostrovia.
la'chiem.
slanta.
rinka.
banzai.
i notice you have sub-divided your b coupons. feeling a little light on principle?
actually, i like to divest just before a major re-capitalization.
and the beast slouches towards bethelem.
excuse me, boys. I would hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
what the hell did you think you were doing?
you have a real gratitude problem. you know that, bruce? i need a name. batboy? the dark earl? what is a good side kick name?
how about richard grayson, college student?
...i missed two-face by a heartbeat. when we catch him, you gotta let me kill him!
we do not kill. killing is what damns you. it-. what am i talking about? this conversation is over. you are going away to school.
i saved your life. you owe me. so either you let me be your partner or I am going after harvey on my own.
maybe they are right.
which `they' might that be, sir?
jack napier's dead. my parents are avenged. the wayne foundation contributes a small fortune to police and crime prevention programs.
why do i keep doing this?
why, indeed?
could i let batman go? for dick. for me. could i leave the shadows? have a life. friends. family...
dr. meridian...
she is the first woman in a long time that's... no. she is the first woman ever. and she loves batman. not bruce wayne. if i let go of batman I will lose her.
perhaps. perhaps not. why not ask the lady?
how? as batman, knowing she wants me? or as bruce wayne and hope...?
why do we need you? you only come between us. we can be the smartest person in gotham city. we want the empire for ourselves. time's up, laughing boy.
kill me? well, alright. go ahead. take the empire. all yours.  hell, harv, old pals. I will kill me for you.
go ahead. you can say it.
you are a genius.
you can't-.
dick, let go. revenge will eat you alive. trust me. i know.
but what about all the good we can do? there are monsters out there. gotham needs us.
and when you finally get two-face?
exactly. and once you would killed him you would be lost. like me.  all this has to be a choice. otherwise...it's a curse.
bruce, you can't.
chase is coming for dinner. why do not you join us.
there is something i want to talk with you about. it's...well, we.. i...
okay, tiger, take it slow. you going to give me your pin or something?
your memories are repressed. they are trying to break through. relax. try to remember-.
i do not want to remember!
stop fighting.
my parents are laid out in the library. their skin smells like talcum powder. I am so small. my father's diary is on his desk like always. I am opening the book. reading. I am running out into the storm. the book is in my hands. i can not hear my screams over the rain. I am falling...
what does it say? what hurts so much, bruce? what does the book say?
i don't-.
you do know. try.
the last entry read, bruce insists on seeing a movie tonight.  bruce insists. i made them go out. i made them take me to the movie. to that theater...  it was my fault. i killed them.
oh god, bruce, you were a child. you were not responsible.
...not the bat?
what?
i always thought it was the bat that scared me that night that changed my life. but it wasn't. the real fear was hiding underneath: what i read in the journal, that my parents' deaths were my fault. that is what i could not remember. that is the crime I have been paying for all these years.
what are you talking about?
chase. there is something i need to tell you--
we want to dust him. we truly want to dust him bad.
oh yes, and certainly _we_ will!
how are you feeling, young man?
not that young. it is been a long time since you have called me that.
old habits die hard. are you alright?
as well as can be expected, i guess. give me the bad news.
dick has run away. they have taken dr. meridian. and I am afraid they found the cave, sir. it is been destroyed.
I am batman? i remember my life as bruce wayne.  but all this. it is like the life of a stranger.
perhaps the fall...
there is one other thing. i feel..
what?
...afraid.
bruce. son. listen to me. you are a kind man. a strong man. but in truth you are not the most sane man.
...a bat.
what?
i remember a bat. a monster. a demon. chasing me.  oh my god, alfred.
no demons, son.  your monsters are here. until you fact that, i fear you will spend your life fleeing them.
master, bruce?
...batman, alfred. I am batman.
all the answers are numbers.
but 1, 3, 1, 8, & 5. what do they mean?
what do maniacs always want?
recognition, of course.
precisely. so this number is probably some kind of calling card.
letters in the alphabet.
of course. 13 is m....mre.
how about, mr. e.
mystery.
and another name for mystery?
enigma.
exactly. mr. e. mister edward nygma.
what now sir?
claw island. nygma's headquarters. I am sure that is where they are keeping chase.  are all the batsuits destroyed?
all except the prototype with the sonar modifications you so disapprove of. but it has not yet been tested.
tonight's a good night.
a-14.
miss.
b-12.
a miss. and my favorite vitamin, i might add.
a hit.
you sunk my battleship.
welcome to my parlor said the riddler to the bat. how is tricks?
no more tricks, edward. release chase and dick. this is between you and me.
death.  death. without taste, sound and all around us.  because there is no way for me to save them or myself. this is one giant death trap.
excellent. see. who says a guy in a rubber suit can not be smart? well, it is been grand. sorry you all have to die now.
wait. i have a riddle for you.
for _me_? really? tell me.
i see without seeing. to me, darkness is as clear as daylight. what am i?
oh please. you are blind as a bat.
exactly!
help chase. I will be back.
did two-face call him bruce?
edward...
who is it?
it is dr. meridian. chase. do you remember me?
how could i forget?
dr. burton tells me you know who batman is.
yesssssss. i know!
who is the batman, edward?
can not tell if you do not say please.
you are right, edward. i did not mean to be impolite. please.
