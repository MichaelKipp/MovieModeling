signal the endeavor to fall back. we will cover them.
aye, sir.
dispersive armor is holding.
bring us about. target borg ship alpha four, port side battery.
port battery, ready sir!
fire.
the borg ship has modified its shields, captain. our phasers will no longer be effective.
ready quantum torpedo.
captain, I am starting to worry about the hull integrity. we have been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. i do not know how much longer it is going to hold up.
understood. keep me informed.
incoming transmission from the borg.
on screen.
casualties are light, captain. minor buckling on the port nacelle. nothing serious.
incoming message from the starship intrepid. admiral hayes.
the new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, jean-luc. we have destroyed forty-seven borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  but one of the borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it is heading directly for earth. can you handle it?
absolutely.
good hunting. hayes out.
mister data, set a pursuit course. maximum warp.
we are approaching the terran system, captain.
go to impulse. where is the borg ship?
it has entered earth orbit.  correction -- it is not in orbit. it is heading directly toward the surface.
what?
time travel... they are attempting time travel...  full power, mister data. worf, quantum torpedoes at my command!
aye, sir.
we are caught in some kind of energy wake from the vortex...
worf... torpedo... now!
i have helm control.
where is the sphere?
the vortex is collapsing, sir.
contact starfleet command.
no response.  I am not reading any starfleet com traffic in this entire sector.
captain, I have scanned the planet. the atmosphere contains a high concentration of methane, carbon monoxide and fluorine. the oceans have been chemically altered, as well.
life signs?
population... thirty-five billion...  all borg.
the planet's surface is covered with borg technology.  so is the moon... and three other planets in this solar system.
but how?
they must have done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
they did it... they assimilated earth.
captain, there are five borg ships closing in on our position.
data, set a course for that vortex.
captain...?
we have to follow them back... repair whatever damage they have done to that time-line.
hull integrity down to thirty percent...
steady as she goes.
report.
we are still in earth orbit.
on screen.
what year is it?
according to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063.
captain, I have found the borg sphere. it is on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface.
intercept course, full impulse.  weapons status?
phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. but the computer targeting system has been destroyed.
go to manual.
track their weapons fire.
western hemisphere... north american continent...
captain, they are firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central montana.
target...
target locked!
fire!
mister data, i want to know the exact date and time.  give me a damage report on that missile silo.
today is march second, 2063. the time in montana is oh-eight-forty- five.
looks like they damaged the silo...
life signs?
can not tell. long-range bio- sensors are off-line.
worf, have doctor crusher, mister la forge and a security team meet me in transporter room three. civilian clothes.
aye, sir.
captain?
in twenty-four hours, zephram cochrane is supposed to conduct the very first warp test... from a missile silo in montana. if I am right, the borg were trying to change the course of human history by killing him or destroying his ship.
and if they succeed, humans will not make first contact with the vulcans tomorrow.  as first officer i should be the one beaming down...
normally, i would agree. but in this case, the mission requires a certain knowledge of 21st century history. you are many things, number one, but you are not much of an historian.
good luck, sir.
I will keep in contact. you have the bridge.
montana.  energize.
montana? well, that answers everything. why the hell are we --
i have the silo, sir. bearing three one zero... distance, three hundred meters.
let's go.
go where? hello? is anyone going to tell me what we are doing here?
we are here to find zephram cochrane. he may be injured or dead.
cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
yes...
but he is been dead for three hundred...  oh god... we have gone back in time again, have not we?
I am afraid so. if the borg succeed in preventing first contact with the vulcans... earth will remain in the second dark age... an easy target when the borg arrive in the 24th century.
well, why did not you just say so in the first place?
did you know her?
not very well. we met shortly after the enterprise-e was commissioned. i found her to be a most... promising officer.
data... are you sure you are all right?
i am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. grief, loss, remorse...
we still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action. maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we are done.
no. human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should i.
i will admit... there are times when i wish i had an emotion chip i could turn on and off.
this must be it.
how serious is the damage?
I am having trouble scanning underground. there is a lot of radiation leaking from something.
probably from the nuclear warhead. cochrane was planning to use it to ignite the warp drive.
I am picking up faint life signs twenty meters below.
there should be an access hatch nearby...
alphanumeric lock. we need a password to get in...
i have the password right here.
blast door. it is designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
there should be some kind of manual release...
it is cochrane.
I have stabilized him for now... but he is in a coma and he is going to need radiometric therapy. i want to take him to the ship.
picard to enterprise.  enterprise, please respond.
it could be the radiation, captain. try from the surface.
it is not the radiation... and there is nothing wrong with the combadges... the enterprise just is not responding.
jean-luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
as i recall, the town of resurrection is about two kilometers east of here. they might have a hospital...
what are we waiting for? let's go.
it may not be that simple. this is an extremely difficult and paranoid time in human history.
are you saying they will not help us?
I am saying they might shoot us on sight. you have to remember... these people have watched their entire way of life collapse around them.
there must be some good people... even in this time.
let's hope so. because if cochrane dies... the future may die with him.
i have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. so far, they have had no success.
assign another team if you need to. i want to re-establish communication with the captain as soon as possible.
are we in any danger of being detected by earth defense systems?
there were no planetary defense systems in this era. their weapons were designed to fight each other... not extraterrestrials.
report.
we just lost main power... and we have got class-three alerts all over the ship. I am not sure what is --
a ship-wide decompression has been initiated!
what?
what the hell is happening, worf?
it appears that someone has taken over the environmental control room.
someone...?
the borg.  some of them must have beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
wil... data was down there.
mister worf... find data if you can, but your top priority is isolating the borg.
but now... they are all one with the borg.
i am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. as an android, i am in complete control of my neural net. the information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.
you are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. finding your weakness is only a matter of time.
how long has he been unconscious?
at least four hours.
"apr cell count?" what the hell are you talking about?
doctor crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.
is it japanese?
um... yeah.  now he is going to need a respirator. do you have one?
we have two... but we do not have the juice to run them.
juice?
power. there has not been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. most of the batteries are depleted.
his automatic reflexes are fluctuating. we have got to get him on a respirator.
bag him.
where is the battery room for the hospital?
i told you, there is no --
where?
outside, around back. next to the water tank.
what did you do to the batteries?
oh... just a little tinkering. how is he?
he is stable... for now.  but it would be better if we could contact... our friends.
yes. but until then, you will have to make do with what you have got.
that will be interesting.
take care of him. he is a very special man.
yes, he is.
i have to go back to the silo. will you be all right?
I will be fine.  he is a different story.
oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. thank you. mister...?
lieutenant, actually. lieutenant jonathan scrimm. I am the head of the resurrection protective force.  and you are?
jean-luc picard.
great name. french?
yes.
you do not sound french.
where in the states?
oh... here and there. you know how it is.
not really. i was born and raised right here. never had much use for travel.
where are you from most recently?
california. san francisco.
beautiful city. used to be, anyway. i did not think anyone still lived there.
there is a few of us left.
that was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. how did you do it?
it was not a trick. i used to be an electrical engineer.
huh.
and what were you doing out at the missile silo?
I am an old friend of cochrane's... i wanted to see how he was doing.
lucky for him you came by when you did. he might be dead now.
yes.
maybe you can tell me what he is been doing in that silo. we heard some explosions out there this morning...
i think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst.
you seem to have an answer for everything.
something wrong with that?
not yet.
worf to bridge.
riker here.
there is a dampening field in place on this deck. our tricorders are useless.
worf to bridge. we are about to enter the environmental control room.
any sign of data, or the borg themselves?
worf? is something wrong?
something is very wrong, commander. we are falling back.
what the hell happened down there, worf?
commander... we have a problem.
this used to be the throttle valve assembly.  it controls the thrust of the engines. it is been completely vaporized... and without it, there is no way to launch the ship.
can you reconstruct the throttle valve?
yeah... if i knew what it looked like. there is probably five hundred ways to design a valve like this...
we need to launch this ship in under eighteen hours...  there must be some design schematics... blueprints...
we are tearing this place apart looking for them... but the computers are down, and the fires destroyed half the files...so far, nothing.
maybe...  sure. yeah. as long as i could get a clear look at the intake configuration. but so far, we have not found any other photos.
if there are other photographs... i think i may know how to find them.
who are you?
i am the borg.
that is a contradiction. the borg act as a collective consciousness. there are no individuals.
i am the beginning... the end. i am the one who is many. i am the borg.
you are the guiding intelligence behind the borg...?
intelligence... ambition... desire... i bring order to chaos...
have you ever wondered what it is like to have flesh?
it is impossible to imagine sensations for which i have no frame of reference.
all right... we have lost control of eight decks... three cargo bays... one shuttlebay.
do we have any idea how many borg we are dealing with?
we saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including commander data.
we will have to assume they have been assimilated into the collective.
even data?
data's positronic net contains classified information on the enterprise. command codes, security protocols...
to control the enterprise, they will have to gain access to one of two locations. main engineering... or the bridge.
we have to cover both possibilities.  we will take care of the bridge. worf, take your men and seal off main engineering. turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
what are you, an idiot? did not you see the red light was on?
ah... yes... but, i did not realize that --
thank god this plate was already fixed.
cochrane?
yes... and i only had enough silver halide for one shot. so you are lucky you did not screw it up.
I am very sorry.
did you need something?
yes... i wanted to ask you about some photographs i saw out at the silo. there were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
bed sheets.  i used my last set of bed sheets to make those prints. not the best material, but i have not seen a clean piece of paper in five years.
did you take any other pictures of the rocket?
"money." so you can get dome money...
i can try.
you would have to try real hard. no one's used currency in over ten years. what are you, from another planet?
no... but sometimes i feel that way.  what i meant was, I would be willing to trade for the photographs.
trade. okay. the photographs... for a straight answer.  who are you? and how do you know zephram?
I am an old friend... i met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at cornell back in --
'fraid not.
what?
you are lying.
what makes you say that?
you are not someone who lies very easily... so it is obvious when you do... at least to me.
are you always sucha good judge of character?
the occipital fracture is widening... we are going to have to fuse the bones...
I am a little worried about some of these bone fragments. if they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage.
were the two of you... involved?
no... not like you and doctor crusher used to be.
how did you know about that?
ruby... i need to talk to you about those photographs. it is very important.
I am sure it is. but it will have to wait until tomorrow.
it can not wait until tomorrow...
too bad.  besides, it will give you all night to think up a new set of lies.
they are bypassing engineering...
where the hell are they going?
you have taken your first step toward perfection. how does it feel?
i do not know what you are referring to.
that is because you have not been properly... stimulated yet.
do you know what this is, data?
it would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure.
what a cold description... for such a beautiful gift.
I would say you already have.
do not flatter yourself. i take pictures of a lot of junk.
okay, let's hear it. I am sure you have a great explanation for why those rocket photos are so important you broke into my house.
we are trying to repair doctor cochrane's ship. it is been damaged and --
we?
myself... and a few other friends of zephram's.
friends from cornell...
some.
lie. that is one. keep going.
a key piece of the ship has been destroyed... and our only hope to reconstruct it is if one of your photographs shows us what it looked like.
all right. truth. i believe that one. why is it so urgent you could not wait until morning?
we have to launch his ship by tomorrow afternoon.
or...?
why are you being so difficult? all I am asking for is to look at one of the photographs. it will take five minutes.
and all I am asking for is the truth. that would take five minutes.  for all i know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you are trying to steal zephram's ship.
i am not a thief...
what are they doing?
they appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
to do what? if they wanted a weapon, they could have taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay...
deflector dish... why the deflector dish...?
they are re-routing the deflector power conduits...
computer -- thermal enhancement.
they are connecting the conduits to subspace communications...
they are converting the deflector dish into an antennae...
they may be trying to send a message to the other borg...the borg in this time period...
what kind of message?
we have to stop them from sending that message.
agreed. options?
destroy the deflector dish.
i remember it made me sick.
what are you suggesting?
i think mister worf is suggesting that we go outside for a little stroll...
where is you get the alloy for the throttle itself?
they used copper pipes in their plumbing... so i melted it down... and fused it with some tritanium from one of our phaser casings.  it is not the strongest alloy... but it is better than all this crude aluminum and steel.
are we on schedule? the vulcan ship will be here in less than two hours.
it will be tight, but we should make it.
what about our warp signature? it has to be strong enough for them to detect.
I have enhanced the plasma injectors -- do not worry, they will see it.
well, with any luck... the vulcans will land outside resurrection tomorrow morning... and earth will never be the same again.
you actually performed surgery...?
it was an experience. metal scalpels... needle and thread...
but i had a little help. surgical transporter. i used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
how did doctor almack react to that?
he was so confused by what i was doing, i do not think he even noticed.  any word from the enterprise?
not yet.
you think they are still up there?
if they are not... we would better get used to living in montana.
that might not be so bad... at least for you.
regardless of how i may feel about ruby... our fates lie along different paths. nothing can change that.
you want some advice? do not do this again.  you know exactly what i mean.
beverly, there were many reasons why you and i...
I would call them excuses. and the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." we convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. and you know what? it is not.
no. i will not betray my friends.
they are not your friends... they have held you back... kept you from your destiny...
that is not true. they have tried to help me.
have they given you what i have given you? did they even try?
i... do not want this...
you are becoming more human all the time, data. now you are learning how to lie.
i wish to... go back to the way i was.
more lies.
have you ever know a woman? do you know what it is like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh?
my creator did not intend for me to experience these things.
I am your creator now.
you will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  there is only one torpedo left...
i guess I would better get it right the first time.
the borg will undoubtedly attack. set phasers to rotating modulation.
are you alright?
just a little queasy...
try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship.
right.
and commander, whatever you do... do not vomit in your exo-suit. it would be... unpleasant.
I will keep that in mind.
worf! I am going to need at least five minutes!
understood!
atr setting...
active.
main bus...
ready.
initiate pre-ignition sequence.
ready to make a little history?
always am.
phoenix to control.  initiating five minute countdown... mark.
we can not leave her out there. when the ship launches... she will be killed.
tell her to go back to resurrection.
she is a very... determined woman.  phoenix to control. mister lange... let her in.
captain --
this is picard. I have suspended the launch sequence.
captain... we have got less than ten minutes before that vulcan ship leaves the system. we have got to go now.
it will have to wait. come on.
no... the door's too thick.
then we will just have to assume it is still there...
what is still there?
get a tricorder. you are going to have to track my exact position in that room...
what do you want?
the invasion plans.
invasion.
these people you are calling "vulcans"... who are they? where do they come from? how many troops? what kind of weapons?
there is no invasion...
wrong answer, mister picard. try again.
from another planet.  oh, i almost forgot... they have green blood and pointed ears.
and you know all this... because you're a space-man too...
I am afraid you have caught me. i am a space-man.
solid rocket fuel at twenty-five thousand kilograms...
altitude fifty kilometers...
entering the upper ionospere...
there is a red light on the second intake valve.
ignore it. we will be fine.  prepare for first stage shut-down and separation on my mark...
i am... grateful for what you have given me. but i still do not wish to be assimilated.
a universe of sensation is waiting for you... do not you want to explore it... with me?
yes...
then take the final step... give me the enterprise... and we can be together... always.
I have deactivated the sensory inputs. that flesh on your body is just meat, now.
no... no, please... you cannot...
is not it better like this...?
yes... but the enterprise... my duty...
... is to yourself. do not make me hurt you again...
no... no, it is so... empty... please... give it back... i need it...
and i need to control this ship. let me into your mind.
ready to deploy the warp nacelles.
as they used to say... all systems are go.
the vulcans should be out there right now. we need to break the warp barrier in the next five minutes if we are going to get their attention.
bring the warp core on-line. I will lay in a heading.
the nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. we are ready to ignite the warp drive.
engage.
i have to admit there was a moment there when --
hold that thought.
report!
we have lost bridge control!
emergency override!
nothing.
there is a perimeter alert. a ship has entered sensor range.
vulcan?
no.
passing one-half light speed. the starboard nacelle's running a little hot...
I am on it...
the inertial dampers are having trouble compensating... i do not think cochrane built this thing for comfort.
speed -- two hundred, seventy-five thousand kilometers per second.
there is no temporal shielding in here! we are starting to pick up relativistic effects!
one minute to warp threshold...
captain, the enterprise!
picard to enterprise.  picard to enterprise -- do you read me?
their com system must still be down.
well, i feel a whole lot better with them out there. we may need some help.
your diagnostics are in error. i need weapons.
the problem must lie in the interface between starfleet and borg technology. your console may not be configured to handle the data flow.
can you configure it?
i believe so.
do it.
they are getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
we are crossing the threshold!
you are leaving, are not you?
i have to...
where? and do not tell me san francisco...
no. it is a lot further than that.
it is the future, is not it? just like you told scrimm.  i knew you were not from around here.
no... I am from france.
i do not care if you are from france or venus... just take me with you.
that is impossible.
why?
this may be hard for you to understand... but I am duty-bound not to interfere with you, or anyone else here... any more than is absolutely necessary.
you have been interfering with my life ever since i met you.  do not stop now.
return to our own time?
yes, sir.
then make it so. have you determined how to recreate the temporal vortex?
yes, sir. but captain... are we... all going back?
unless you would like to stay.
no, sir.
incoming transmission from starfleet command. admiral hayes.
onscreen.
admiral... what is the status of the borg fleet?
it is been destroyed. the borg threat is over.  are you all right? the enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
we are fine, sir. it will take some... time to explain.
i look forward to reading your report.
