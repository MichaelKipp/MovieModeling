the superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
i do apologize.    a student had a crisis.
how wonderful, darling.  what does that mean for you?
I will be running it three days a week, and...
will you get time off to do that?
not now, but maybe later, if they like the program.
what is up with you?
me? nothing. tell me more about the job.
just go ahead and tell us.
there is nothing to tell.
are you sure, dear?
come on.
no, really. tell me about the promotion.
well, my theory is that people can really enjoy math, but they lose interest...
my goodness. a wedding.      my goodness.
wow.   congratulations.
tell us every detail.
you have only known jake a few months.
so, another one bites the dust.
it is not another one. it is my sister.  are not you happy for her?
she is only known the guy a few months.
can i put these here for tonight?
in there is better.  it is kind of romantic, do not you think?
i really think if you are going to spend your life with someone you want to know them pretty damn well.
believe me, i know your feelings on the matter.
the receptionist said you called earlier about something.
my math program. the superintendent said he would fund it.
good going. i knew you could do it.
yeah?
huntley told me today that if i come through on the benton deposition, they may consider me for senior associate.
i was thinking dinner on friday with james and meg at the saint mark.
i mean tonight.
actually, i need to review the deposition questions tonight. maybe tomorrow?
oh, ok.   maybe.
but i thought if you do not mind, you could listen and see how i come across?
sure. of course.
she says she will not even come if dad brings monica.
mom will not miss your wedding. she will come around. i promise she will.
how?
I will talk to her, and to dad, too.  a few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they will be ours.
maybe if we had them both to dinner or something.
maybe.
you always throw the best dinner parties, letty.
oh, wait a minute, now i see where you are going.
please, letty.
mom and dad? at dinner together? are you crazy?
maybe, though. maybe it would work. i could throw you an engagement party maybe.
really?
you know what, ruthie? i better get back to my class, ok?
and the party?
yeah, it will be fun.
what are you doing?    you are going to be late.
I am calling in sick.
you do not have a fever.
i do not feel like going to work today.
will not it be hard for them to get a substitute this late?
but what about that math project?
paul, i just can not go. is that ok with you or am i committing some horrible crime?
forget i asked.
I am sorry.  I am just...i'm so tired lately.
maybe you ought to see a doctor.
no, it is not like that.
it is just I have got those parent conferences, and I am supposed to set up the math program by next week. and shopping for ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner.
you can get out of the dinner.
no, i can't. I have already convinced both mom and dad to come.
come on, letty.   it will get done.
i do not think so.
of course it will. remember the big talent show you planned last year? and what about the christmas benefit when santa canceled at the last minute? but you still pulled it off.
yeah.
you just need to get more organized. l
where is the old bag i sometimes call mommy?
she said she would be here at 10.
what do you think of this one?
I would have to see it on.
things have been kind of stressful lately.
but everything's ok?
yeah, everything's under control.
what about the engagement party?
everything's ready for tomorrow night--except the artillery.
thanks so much for planning it, letty. jake's really looking forward to it.
what about this one?
you look beautiful.
really?
truly.
hi, mom.
look, mom, i think I have found the dress.
has paul heard about his promotion?
no, not yet. but you know paul. he is sure to get it.
oh no.
paul could pop the question at any time.
mom, please.
especially with a promotion in the offing.
go on, letty. i want to see it on you.
do you think i should?
i gather he is late as usual.
can i get you a glass of champagne?
you know what i think we need? martinis. how about martinis to celebrate?
yes.
how can i help?
paul, can you hand me the olives? ruth, i need you to, what was it?
what about the souffle?    has that gone in?
fuck me.
what is the matter?
what is all the dreck?
sage, rosemary...  les herbes.
it will be fine.
no, no. they have got to be puglia olives, packed in a light brine with a flavor that does not overpower the palate.
what are you doing?
can you loan me a 20?
sure. why?
I am going to the store.
i think you are overreacting.
letty, dinner's almost ready.   the souffle...
I will be back before you can say souffle.
do you mind if i call you letitia?
letty.
first off, letty, can you tell me where you are?
i answered these questions last night.
i know this can be a real drag, but the attending physician on day shift is required to do his own prelim exam when a patient is admitted during the night.
no, 79. sorry, this makes me nervous.
it is ok. it is not a pass-fail kind of thing.
chair, cup and ball.
terrific.
let me shift gears here a minute...  do you ever hear voices that other people do not hear or see things they don't?
no.
what about patterns? do you find yourself checking and re-checking locks? or washing your hands over and over again?
yes?   go right ahead.
sometimes my food, and my clothes, and my underwear.
how do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
by color.
what if it is got a pattern?
is this really important? because i do not think it is a problem.
a while, i guess.
that must be really difficult.
hello, letitia. I am dr. emlee, and i have some questions to ask you...
i did this already.
it is hospital policy...
I am the only doctor making rounds this morning.
well, i do not have hallucinations. honest.
this doctor, was he tall, with dark hair?
yeah, and a dimple.
I am afraid lhe's not a doctor.
psychologist, therapist, whatever.
patient.
what?
what kind of place is this?
i apologize for the inconvenience, but i must ask you some...
i want to see my mother immediately.
we discourage family visits for the first 48 hours after an emotional trauma like the kind you have experienced.
i do not think you understand.    i will not wait.
all tapped out.
I will float you.
I am really not that hungry.
just eat whatever you want. this will give you a chance to meet some people.
I am here, sweetheart. I am here. it is going to be ok.
I am sorry. I am so sorry.
oh, letty, what happened?
mom, i was there, and i just, i was so... they did not have the olives, and i, i got so upset. i do not know how it happened.
I have talked to doctor emlee, and he says...
I am so glad to see you. you can not believe the people in here. they have got patients posing as doctors...
everyone says it is the best facility in the area for this sort of thing.
i just want to go home.   can we go home now?
maybe i should talk about this with ruth, or paul.
we all agree with the doctor, dear. he thinks it is safer for you to stay here for a while.
yes.
but what about beast?   who'll...?
ruth's already taken him home.
and my class. it will be hard to find a good substitute. and what about my math program?
paul said he would call the school.  and your father thinks he is convinced the guard not to press charges as long as you get help.
I will see you soon.
tomorrow?
as soon as dr. emlee says.
hey there. they are showing "groundhog day" if you...
you took bets on my diagnosis?
it is no big deal.   we all compare.
who do you think you are?
do not take it personally.
you have no right, no right to take the worst thing that is ever happened to me and make it into some kind of game.
stop acting like you are someone special. you are just like the rest of us.
I am not the one who is masquerading as a doctor. I am not the one who's, who's...
do we have to talk about this?
i think in the spirit of group therapy, it is beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
what are you looking to read?
anything interesting.
but you are checking it out.
I have already checked it out 17 times.
it is prettier here than i thought it would be.
yeah, i guess it is all right.
are you all right?
that is a big question.
i hope it was not something i did.
something you did?
of course not, no.  is that why you are here?
i think we need to talk about some things.
yes, i suppose so.
this has been really difficult, this whole thing.
no.
especially this last year.
especially now.
so, I have been thinking a lot...
i talked to ruth a little bit, and i think it is about time...
i know. we can not just keep going through the motions.
exactly. it is time to make decisions.
you do not have to say anything else. I have known for a while that this was coming.
i just wish we would done it sooner.
i had to smuggle it in here. i guess you are not really supposed to have jewelry.
or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
i hope you like it. it is a marquis cut, 1.5 carats. they had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines.  letty?
it's, it is really nice, paul.
no, you have done a perfect job.
so, what do you say, let?
sure. we will save the formal announcement for when you are out. i already told your mother. i hope you do not mind.
no, no.
so will you?
of course. yes. i will.     i do.
you missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
i was not hungry.
john even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into mrs. hallstrom's milk.
finally. i was getting tired of watching him try every night.
was it bad news--the visit from peter?
paul.
he asked me to marry him.
very romantic setting.
it was romantic.   he is very romantic.
so are you engaged, or what?
what have you done with the ring?
it is magic.
guess which hand.
enough with the abracadabra.
guess.
the left one.
really, this is not funny.
ok, ok, I will give it back.
for a price.
good god.
a small price.
i will not do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
no.
and I am not covering for you when you sneak out to call dominos.
the medicine's still bothering me. it feels like i have cotton wrapped around my brain.
we will see about adjusting the dosage if that does not clear in the next  how are other things going?
the question, letty, is how are you feeling?
i miss beast a lot, too.
i can not believe you finally gave me the shirt.
loaned you. and it is only 'til you get out of here.
that settles it. I am never leaving.
i can hardly wait 'til you are free. planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
you are slowing.
mom and i fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
what do you think?
ecru.
and then the gold scroll or the black romanesque print?
do we have to talk wedding details?
oh, no, of course not.
what is his name, letty?
i did not say...
we are supposed to be asleep.
exactly.
we will get caught.
no rounds for another three hours.
nervous? scared? worried you are not fit for a caper of epic proportions?
do not be ridiculous.
rendezvous at the closet in 30.
letty, you should be in bed.
there is a spider in my room.
yeah?
it is got a green dot on its back. i can not go to sleep with it watching me.
sounds awful. i guess we better check it out.
it had this red spot on its back.
green spot.
mottled really.   green and red.
i do not know why you feel you have to lie, letty.
lie?
if you feel lonely, or need to talk, all you have to do is say so.
to talk?  well, ok, that might be good.
i understand you just got engaged. maybe that is where we should start.
i do not mean to go on and on like this.
it is ok.   it is good to let it out.
you can only do what feels best to you now.
i guess so. i think that is right.
you have been so great. i just feel a lot clearer about things.
I am glad.
how is it look?
shhh. they are coming to the cubic zirconium.
i like those sapphire earrings myself.
simulated sapphires. i bet my daughter would love those, too.
i could not really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
well, letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
I am a grown woman, dr. emlee.   i can take care of myself.
what about michael? do you know the extent of his...
i know michael's a schizophrenic, and mrs. hallstrom's manic- depressive, and john lockyer has episodes of psychosis, and i heard a rumor that you suffer from delusions of grandeur.
go ahead and put the guard back up, letty. but you need to know what you are dealing with.
i do not need a lecture.   i care about michael.
then that is even more reason to listen. look, schizophrenics tend to withdraw from reality. they experience emotional disturbances that result in personality changes.
look, i know he is almost through with treatment here. and, he is on medication.
drugs can help suppress symptoms. but lots of patients stop taking them when they are on their own because the side effects are so harsh.  and, michael's condition is often worsened by periods of stress. he is been in and out of...
i do not want to hear anymore.
first you tell me to do what i want to, then you tell me to stop.
all i want you to do is think about what is best for you. really think about it.
a daisy for the lady.
the lady knows this is a dandelion.
a rose is a rose.
thanks.    where have you been all day?
back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
I am not allowed to see you anymore.
really?    me too.
i had to sneak by the guards to get here. they say you are highly unstable, have a depressive personality, and may hold back my own recovery.
wow.    I am bad news.
what is my rap?
schizophrenic recidivism marked by hallucinations and paranoid delusions.
really, though. my thoughts go haywire sometimes.
what are the delusions like?
shocking, huh?
sure. but i took out a whole grocery store.
i wish i could have seen that.
I am starting to think that everyone's crazy to some extent.
my grandma rosa says that some trees get planted in rich top soil, and they grow right up to the sun, tall and straight. other trees, they start as seeds in the crevices between rocks so they have to twist and bend to reach the light.  but even though they end up crooked, they are still trees, just like the straight ones.
why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? that is no way for us to break up.
break up?    they wish.
it is so good to see you, sweetheart.
you too, mom.
you are looking good.    a little thin, but good.
which flowers did you order?
we haven't. i wanted to talk that over with you, too.
oh, ok, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
i was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
we are not allowed to wear jewelry in here, mom.
just think, pretty soon, we will be doing all these wedding preparations for you.  of course, if that is what you still want. ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here.
i have not had a crush since i was
when did you start smoking?
i hear this michael fellow is schizophrenic.
mom, please.
do not forget that paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much...
mom, look, if i want to dump paul, I will dump him. if i want to screw michael or live with him or marry him, then I will do that.
I am only looking out for you.
and if i want to smoke, I will fucking smoke.
mrs. hallstrom, why do not you join my family for dinner. you will love my grandma rosa.
that is so sweet, michael. but, really, I have so many things to do.
you must have thought about it. everyone does.
i just want to see beast.  where would you go?
the mission up in santa barbara.
no way.
that is where i always go when i get out.
what else would you do?
I would like to drink a bottle of red wine with you and then make love to you and spend the whole night together. and we would get up in the morning and spend hours lounging around and reading the paper.
and we would eat spaghetti-o's in bed from the can.
how can you even mention spaghetti- o's after eating grandma rosa's dinner tonight?
i have a terrible confession.
tell the doctor.
i do not like lamb.
then it is over.
lie down.
it is a good thing my family loves you.
your family just met me.
you are right. i guess i was projecting. what i should have said is, "it's a good thing i love you."
do you?
i do.
michael, i...
it is ok. you do not have to say anything.
but i do.     i love you, too.
john and nurse gates are waiting for you.
oh, right.     I am ready.   how do i look?
great. i came to tell you to break a leg, and to give you this for good luck.
what is so urgent?   you have got me worried.
i need to tell you something, and I am not sure how.
you can tell me anything.  do you want to postpone the wedding? is it too much pressure?
no...
that is a load off my mind.
you what?
i do not mean to hurt you.    i know this is a terrible thing.    and i have really loved you.
whoa. whoa. have really loved me? letty, it is natural to be nervous. but we are going to work through our problems.
I have met someone else.
who?
it does not matter who.
have you been seeing another teacher?
no.
it is a doctor, is not it? that is unethical. I will have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
he is a patient here.
of all the crazy things. i understood when you dropped out of law school. and during this whole mess, I have tried to be supportive. but, really, letty, what can you be thinking?
i love him.
you are going to throw away our life together for some shared experience with a looney-tune that you misguidedly think is love?
here's the ring.
no way. you keep the ring.     you will come to your senses.
well?
home free.
tell me all.
i was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
so there were no problems?
not a one.
and did you go to the mission?
just checking.
i saw paul leaving.    did you do the dirty deed?
yeah.
so, it is over?
all over.  did you see your new apartment?
furnished?
no, i need some serious household advice.
first off, you will need to go to target. and, let's see, what should you buy?
i better make a list.
list schmist. you will remember.
but what i really can not believe is that I am starting to actually miss work.
have you been in contact with the principal about your job?
i thought about calling, but i want to wait until i know when I will be out.
then, you should call.
what?
i think it is about that time, letty. the charges against you have been dropped, the drugs have evened out and you seem to be dealing with your life quite well.
are you saying I am through with therapy?
must you walk so quickly?
it is good exercise, mom.
I am so thankful you will be leaving next week. if you want me to pick you up, i will.
I have already made arrangements.
mom, we agreed. you can visit, but you are not allowed to mention michael.
not even if it is something positive?
honestly, letty.
a deal's a deal.
so, we will meet every tuesday and friday. and if you have any kind of emergency, you can page me.
ok, good. that is good. thanks an awful lot for everything, and for coming down here to see me off.
it was just a little going-away gesture.
i have a going-away gesture for you, too.
oh?
are not you supposed to throw a bouquet or something?
are not you ever quiet?
where to?
I have heard the mission in santa barbara is the place to go.
this is it -- 3b.     check it out.
open up.    i want to see.
wow.
you like it?
i love the pillows.
throw pillows, letty. the sales lady said they are the latest thing.
very trendy. let's see the rest.
it is tv heaven.
i was tired of watching what everyone else wants to watch. now we can watch two shows at once.
let's try out the bed.
you have got to see the kitchen first.
do you like it?
i love your apartment.
really?
what do you say we go out to dinner to celebrate?
out? are you kidding?     I have got all the fixings here.
how can you not like the top 10 list?
i like it.     but headlines are better.
you are so wrong.
hey.
it is sex time.
did i get spaghetti sauce on my face?
no.
michael.
shhhh.
not yet.
I will be forced to tickle you.
I am supposed to meet the principal in half an hour.
I will see you tonight.
good luck.
you, too. kick ass today.
sounds good. oh, and letty?
yeah?
you have got one hell of a great body.
well, i understand.     i know my behavior was poor.
so, in light of how the parents feel, and the fact the students are doing so well with the substitute, i do not think i can put you back in the classroom just yet.
look, gail, I have been a good teacher.
i know, letty. but the incident with zach was frightening for the children.  now if you would come to me, explained what was going on...
believe me, i wish I would understood what was going on. I have worked really hard to get better.
I am glad you are doing well.
I have already thought about how to tell the kids where i was.
it is a very nice letter. but i have to go with what is best for the students.
what does that mean?
i need someone to work on budget projections.
office work?
or, of course, you could take a sabbatical the rest of the year.
gosh, letty, this is a great place.
thanks.
this must be beast.
that is mr. beast to you.
i bombed. it is either work in the office or nothing.
sounds grim.
yeah.    how was the job search?
who ever said sanity was fun?
it does not matter.    it will work out.
promise?
promise.  as long as we have steak.
steak?
the store was busy.
you got wine. that is great.
would you mind if we just called it an early night?
you go ahead and relax. I will cook.
i think i should go home.
are you ok?
big restaurant interview tomorrow.
four interviews. four no-gos.
the restaurant, too?
i could not even face that one.
that is ok. we can call and reschedule in the morning.
you do not have to take care of me, you know.
just promise you will love me even if i end up in a job where i have to wear a blue polyester cap.
i think you know I would love you even more in a blue polyester cap.
you are going to miss the top ten.
coming.
hey, letty. mrs. mayer.
i got worried. are you ok?
how may i help you?
congratulations.
michael just got a job.    could not you congratulate him?
i will, dear. i promise.  why mcdonald's?
he is been looking everywhere for weeks, mom.   it is not that easy after you have been locked away.
I am going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.
do not be fresh.
just remember that i love him.
aunt lily is the one who married your father's cousin?
no, that is aunt connie. lily is the one who looks like a hooker.
oh. and, harry, he is the one who likes magic?
you do not have to know all this by saturday. it took me years.
aunt lily?
bingo.
i do not think people even noticed. i thought the ceremony was perfect.
that is thanks to all your help.
something like that.
when he could get time off from the restaurant business.
how about a dance?
bye, uncle cort.  what is with the lie?
it was not exactly a lie.
what is it? are you ok?
always the drugs.
what?
i saw you talking to my mom.
we both talked to her, michael. and your dad.
what do you mean not taking your meds?
why did you tell?
i did not talk to her about medications, michael. do not be silly.
silly?   silly am i?
michael, take it easy.
silly, silly, silly.
i think i should call someone.
do not upset my mom.     do not you upset my mom.
michael, calm down. please. it is ok.
you did the right thing.
i ruined your wedding night.
oh, ruthie, what am i going to do?
you do not have to make any decisions tonight.
but what am i going to do?
do you want to go see him? I will take you if you want to go.
i can't.    i can not see him there.
i was so sure. i really thought it would work.  we have plans, ruth.
i know.    i know.
I am glad you agreed to see me.
I am just glad there are not any hard feelings.
oh, none. none. i completely understand what was going on.
oh.
how is work going?    are you back at school?
i start on monday.
getting back.
i heard about your friend.
what?
i heard your friend was back in the hospital.
michael.   yes.
our relationship meant a lot to me, too, paul. but it is over.  and michael being in the hospital does not really change things.
i think I have heard this speech before.
I am really sorry.
I have got a deposition that i really need to get cracking on, so if you do not mind...
sure, i understand.
i guess we need to talk.
i guess so.
it is hard to know where to start.
i sure know what that feels like.
and all the plans we have.
yeah, the plans.
I have been thinking i could try to visit you at night after work, and then there would be more time on weekends to see...
letty, please.
like I have told you before i do not want you taking care of me.
someone has to take care of you right now, michael. you tore up the apartment. you stopped taking your medications.
but that was not me.    i did not mean to do that.
well then why did it happen?
i do not know. i do not fucking know.
I am sorry.     i did not come here to blame you.
i did not mean for any of this to happen.
oh, god, michael, i know.  why does everything have to be so hard?
what are we going to do?
what do you want to do?
i know i do not want to lose you.     i do not think i could stand it.
i love you so much.
i love you too, letty.     i love you, too.
maybe we could just run away to tahiti and live on the beach.
that is the best idea I have heard in a long time.
do not you have a magic trick or something to make this easier?
how about something better?   like a kiss.
would that really be such a good idea for either of us?
just promise me you will be ok, ok?
i will. and you make sure you take care of yourself.
i guess i should go now.
you should go.
