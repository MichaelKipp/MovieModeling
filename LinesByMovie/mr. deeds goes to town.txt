newspaperman?
wants to know who the heir is.
hang up.
sorry, mac, i can't. yeah, mac. sure, but i ain't the attorney—
hang up.
mr. cedar is, and i haven't seen him in two days.  listen, cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
i'm not interested in the newspapers.
but it's a great story. somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
yes, i know. my first concern is to locate the lucky man. when i do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
it's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in.
thank heaven.
better wire him right away, john.
i'll do no such thing. i'm going there myself. you're going with me too, anderson - and you too, cobb.
yes?
make three reservations on the first train out to mandrake falls, vermont.
where?
mandrake falls.  m-a-n—
that's pretty.
are you sure this is the town he lives in?
good morning.
morning, neighbors. morning.
i say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of longfellow deeds?
deeds?
yes.
yes, sir. yes, indeedy. everyone knows deeds.
yes, i—
we'd like to get in touch with him. it's very important.
who's that?
deeds! who do you think i'm talking about?
oh, yes - deeds. fine fellow. very democratic. you won't have no trouble at all. talk to anybody.
i guess we'd better try somebody else.
no, we won't! the next time that jumping jack comes out, i'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
is mr. deeds in?
no - he's over to the park arranging for the bazaar, so's to raise money for the fire engine.  mal, you shoulda knowed he was in the park.
come in, please. come in. can i get you a cup of tea?
no, thanks.
sit down. sure i couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
that's very kind of you. are you related to him?
no, i'm his housekeeper.
well, we'd like to find out something about him. what does he do for a living?
he and jim mason own the tallow works. but that's not where he makes his money. he makes most of it from his poetry.
who are they?
i don't know.
mr. longfellow deeds?
yes.
how do you do.
how do you do.
i'm john cedar - of the new york firm of cedar, cedar, cedar and budington.
new mouthpiece. been waiting two weeks for this. kids keep swiping them all the time. they use 'em for bean shooters.  what can i do for you gentlemen?
you gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
i'd like to ask you a few questions.
all right.
mr. deeds, are you the son of dr. joseph and mary deeds?
yes.
are your parents living?
why, no.
mr. deeds, does the name of martin w. semple mean anything to you?
not much. he's an uncle of mine, i think. i never saw him, but my mother's name was semple, you know.
well, he passed on. he was killed in a motor accident in italy.
he was? gee, that's too bad. if there's anything i can do to—
how about lunch? are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
of course they're going to stay.  she's got some fresh orange layer cake. you know, with the thick stuff on the top?  sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.
perhaps you didn't hear what i said, mr. deeds! the whole semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
oh, yes, i heard you all right. $20,000,000. that's quite a lot, isn't it?
oh, it'll do in a pinch.
yes, indeed. i wonder why he left me all that money? i don't need it.
mr. cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
buffer?
yeah. a glorified doormat.
yes. you see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. the world's full of pests. then there's the newspapers to handle. one must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
cedar, cedar, cedar and budington. funny, i can't think of a rhyme for budington.
why should you?
well, whenever i run across a funny name, i always like to poke around for a rhyme. don't you?
nah.
i've got one for cobb—
"there once was a man named cobb, who kept semple away from the mob. came the turn of the tide and semple - he died - and now poor cobb's out of a job!"
sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
huh?
i've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
oh, i don't mean that. i'm sure i'm going to need your help.
oh, that's different if it's just poetry.
are you a married man, mr. deeds?
who - me? no.
no, he's too fussy for that. that's what's the matter with him. there are lots of nice girls right here in mandrake falls who're dying to be married—
don't pay any attention to her.
he's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
now you keep out of this!
saving a lady in distress, eh? well, i suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  incidentally, we'd better get started. you'll have to pack.
what for?
you're going to new york with us.
when?
this afternoon - at four o'clock.
i don't think we've got any suitcases.
well, we could borrow a couple from mrs. simpson. you know, she went to niagara falls last year.
i'm kind of nervous. i've never been away from mandrake falls in my life. kind of like to see grant's tomb, though.
i can understand that.  we'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  congratulations, mr. deeds. you're one of the richest men in the country. we'll see you later.  goodbye and thank you.
see you later, kid.
hear what he said? you know how much twenty million is?
i don't care how much it is. you sit right there and eat your lunch. you haven't touched a thing.
i can't find him.
you can't?
i looked everywhere. i even went to his house. it's locked up.
look!
what?
that tuba player!
have a drink?
no, thanks.
will you have a cigar?
no, thank you.
i wouldn't worry if i were you. of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. so don't worry. leave everything to me.
oh, i wasn't worried about that.
no?
i was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
we've got nothing to worry about. he's as naive as a child.
john—
close that door.  will you get mrs. cedar on the phone, please?
come on, john. what happened?
the smartest thing i ever did was to make that trip.
i know, budington. we can't afford to have the books investigated right now. you must have said that a thousand times already.
but what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh—
well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
but a half million dollars! my goodness, where are we going to get—
will you stop worrying! it was i who got old man semple to turn everything over to us, wasn't it? and who got the power of attorney from him ! all right, and i'll get it again!  i'll take it easy. those books'll never leave this office.
look, i can do it!
what's gotten into you, babe? i remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let cobb get away with a thing like this.
oh, he's not getting away with anything.
listen, babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have—
can i have a month's vacation?
with pay!
with pay!
uh-huh.
leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow.
now you're talking, babe. i'll keep the whole front page open. what are you going to do?
have lunch.
it's merely a suggestion. i don't wish to press the point, mr. deeds, but if you'll give me your power of attorney we'll take care of everything. it'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. strangest kind of people. salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. i haven't had a minute to myself. haven't seen grant's tomb yet.
well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. he left everything to us. he traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. you should do the same thing, mr. deeds.
besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
yes. that is to say—
well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
oh - nothing. no extra charge.
that involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
yes, but that's an added service a firm like cedar, cedar, cedar and budington usually donates.
budington. funny, i can't think of a rhyme for budington yet.
the gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. they're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
they are? i forgot all about them.  what do you think they want?
well, your uncle was chairman of the board of directors. they probably expect you to carry on.
i'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
thanks  oh, did you send that telegram to jim mason?
jim mason?  oh, yeah. yeah. no, i didn't send it. i've got it written out, though. here it is.  "arthur's been with the tallow works too long. stop. don't think we should fire him. longfellow."
fine. send it right away. i don't want him to fire arthur.
oh, sure. sure. we don't want to fire arthur.
he was the last baby my father delivered, arthur was.
i think you ought to give this matter some thought, mr. deeds.
huh?
i mean, about the power of attorney.
oh, yes. yes, i will.
why not? who is he?
a lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  tell him to see me at my office.
well, if he has a claim, we'd better see him.  send him in.
he's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, mr. deeds.
how can he make any trouble for me? i haven't done anything.
mrs. semple?
yes. your uncle's common-law wife. she has a legal claim on the estate.
i leave it to you, mr. deeds. can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
what kind of wife did you say she was?
common-law wife. on top of that, there's a child.
a child? my uncle's?
yes, sir.
that's awful. the poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
i'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, mr. deeds.
if she was his wife, she should have all the money. that's only fair. i don't want a penny of it.
you'd better get right down there. that opera mob is about to break into the mad song from "lucia."[2]
oh, i don't want to keep them waiting any longer. they're important people.  i wish you'd go along with me, cobb. they're all strangers to me.
well, what about it, mr. deeds?
you'll excuse me, won't you? i'll be right back.
gee, i'm busy. did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
uh-huh.
that's funny. why is that?
why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
i'm chairman?
oh yes, of course - you've just been elected.
i'm chairman.
wait a minute. what does the chairman do?
why, the chairman presides at the meetings.
that's what i thought. if you don't mind, i'm rather interested in the treasurer's report. i'd like to hear it.
you see, mr. deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
it isn't? what is it conducted for?
why, it's an artistic institution—
we own an opera house, don't we?
we provide opera.
but you charge. i mean, you sell tickets?
that's impossible. the opera has never paid.
well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
the wrong kind! there isn't any wrong or right kind. opera is opera!
i guess it is. but i personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. that wouldn't be common sense. incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
me?!
naturally.
excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
now, where were we?
you see, mr. deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
why not?
because it just isn't a business, that's all!
well, maybe it isn't to you, but it certainly is a business to me, if i have to make up a loss of $180,000. if it's losing that much money, there must be something wrong. maybe you charge too much. maybe you're selling bad merchandise. maybe lots of things. i don't know. you see, i expect to do a lot of good with that money. and i can't afford to put it into anything that i don't look into. that's my decision for the time being, gentlemen. goodbye, and thank you for making me chairman.
sorry to keep you waiting so long. those opera people are funny. they wanted me to put up $180,000.
what about it, mr. deeds?
why, i turned them down, naturally.
no, i mean - about my client.
oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
tails tonight, sir?
what - tails?  why, that's a monkey suit![5] do you want people to laugh at me?  i never wore one of those things in my life.
yes, sir.
of course, we don't want to appear greedy, mr. deeds.
huh?
i say we don't want to appear greedy.
oh. that.
what do you think you're doing?
why, i'm assisting you, sir.
get up from there. i don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. get up from there!
yes, sir.
imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
mrs. semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
and don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
no, sir.
excuse me. what did you say?
mrs. semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
one-third? that's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
well, we didn't expect that much. i'm sure i can get her to settle quietly for one million.
you're making a mistake, mr. deeds.
oh no, i'm not. i don't like your face. besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. i'm surprised that mr. cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
now wait a minute, buddy—
there's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. when the servant comes in, mr. hallor, i'm going to ask him to show you to the door. many people don't know where it is.
no use in getting tough. that'll get you nowhere, mr. deeds.  you know, we've got letters.
will you show mr. hallor to the front door?
yes, sir.
i can't hold out on you any longer. lamb bites wolf.  beautiful.
only common sense.
i can't hold out any longer either, mr. deeds.  being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
you're not my attorney yet, mr. cedar. not till i find out what's on your mind. suppose you get the books straightened out quick so i can have a look at them.
yes, of course, if you wish. but you must be prepared. this sort of thing will be daily routine.  if it becomes annoying, you let me know. goodbye, mr. deeds. goodbye, sir.
well, how about tonight? what would you like in the way of entertainment?
entertainment?
your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. how would you like yours? dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
what're you talking about?
women! ever heard of 'em?
oh.
name your poison and i'll supply it.
some other time, cobb. some other time.
okay, you're the boss.  when your blood begins to boil, yell out. i'll be seeing you!
he talks about women as if they were cattle.
every man to his taste, sir.
tell me, walter, are all those stories i hear about my uncle true?
well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
twenty! what did he do with them?
that was something i was never able to find out, sir.
no. don't ever want to go out without telling us.
who are you?
yeah, mr. cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
that's very nice of mr. cobb - but i don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
that's going to be fun.
some people like it.
put that away, slug!  at your service!
i got a trunk in that room. will you get it out for me?
certainly.
i suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
i tell you that dame's nuts.
right.
you fainted.
oh, did i? i'm sorry . . .
no, thank you. i'll be all right.
look, this is my house. i'd like to—
oh, no, really - i'll be all right.
what happened?
well, i guess i walked too much. i've been looking for a job all day. i found one, too. i start tomorrow.  you've been awfully kind. thank you very much.
come on, come on!
hurry up!
feel better now?
mmm, it tastes so good. mr. deeds, i don't know how i can ever thank you.
tell me more about yourself.
well, i guess i've told you almost everything there is to tell. my folks live in a small town near hartford. i'm down here alone trying to make a living.  oh, i'm really just a nobody.
oh, that was so lovely. thank you.
you were a lady in distress, weren't you?
what?
oh - uh - nothing.
huh? on, no. nobody important.
be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
uh-huh.
i'm a writer myself, you know.
uh-huh.
i write poetry.
uh-huh.
you've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  all those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
no. that is, i didn't—  until i met you. i like talking to you, though—  imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
brookfield just came in.
oh, the poet? where?
over at that big round table. the one that looks like a poodle.
look - there's brookfield, the poet.
really?
no - i don't want it, thank you.
why, you must drink! all poets drink!
well, i don't know. i—
mr. morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off.
yes. have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
well, i play the tuba.
no.
you mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
look, he's temperamental.
yeah, what if i am? what about it?
there's just one thing more. if it weren't for miss dawson being here with me, i'd probably bump your heads together.
oh, i don't mind.
say fellow, you neglected me - and i feel very put out.  look, sock it right there, will you? lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard.
that's all right. i got it off my chest.
the difference between them and me is i know when i've been a skunk. you take me to the nearest news- stand and i'll eat a pack of your postcards raw. raw!
oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. pal, you've added ten years to my life!  a poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! delicious!  you're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
thanks, but miss dawson and i are going out to see the sights.
fine, fine. swell, you just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and i'd like to reciprocate. listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet—  —thanks - and i'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
i'd kind of like to see grant's tomb - and the statue of liberty.
well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the leaning tower of pisa - you'll mount mt. everest. i'll show you the pyramids and all the little pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
binge?
yes. i mean the real mccoy. listen, you play saloon with me, and i'll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in new york. we'll go on a twister that'll make omar the soused philosopher of persia[7] look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet.
that ought to be fun.
fun?  say, listen, i'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  boy! boy! my headpiece!
cinderella man! that's sensational, babe! sensational!
it took some high-powered acting, believe me.
did it?
i was the world's sweetest ingenue.
is he really that big a sap?
he's the original. there are no carbon copies of that one.
cinderella man! babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. can you imagine cobb's face when he reads this?
if we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
how'd you get the picture?
had the boys follow us.
marvelous!  "at two o'clock this morning, mr. deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. when asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'i just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  beautiful! what happened after that?
i don't know. i had to duck to get the story out. he was so far along he never even missed me.
when're you going to see him again?
tonight, maybe.  i'll phone him at noon.  oh, my lunch hour. i'm a stenographer, you know. mary dawson.
you're a genius, babe - a genius!
i even moved into mabel dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy cobb might start looking around.
good! good!  stay there. don't show your face down here. i'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. they'll never know where the stories are coming from. stick close to him, babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. we'll have the other papers crazy.  babe, i could kiss you!
oh, no. no. our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
sure.
with pay!  she is out the door.
you'll get it, babe. you'll get it.
mr. deeds - mr. deeds, sir - you really must get up. it's late!
you're walter, aren't you?
yes, sir.
i just wanted to make sure.
yes, sir.
what's that?
a prairie oyster, sir.[10]
prairie? oysters?
yes, sir. it makes the head feel smaller.
oh. oh!  has miss dawson called yet?
miss dawson, sir? no, sir. no miss dawson has called, sir.
she was a lady in distress. she wouldn't let me help her. got a lot of pride. i like that.
oh, i do too, sir.
i'd better call her up and apologize. i don't remember taking her home last night.
i'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
what do you mean? i remember everything!  hand me my pants - i wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
you have no pants, sir.
you came home last night - without them.
i did what!
as a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. you were in your - uh - shorts. yes, sir.
oh, don't be silly, walter. i couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. i'd be arrested.
that's what the two policemen said, sir.
what two policemen?
the ones who brought you home, sir. they said you and another gentleman kept walking up and down the streets, shouting: "back to nature! clothes are a blight on civilization! back to nature!"
please!
but how'll i put on the slipper, sir?
yes, sir. i beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
looking for?
you kept searching me last night, sir. going through my pockets. you said you were looking for a rhyme for budington.
better bring me some coffee, walter.
very good, sir.  oh, i beg pardon. a telegram came for you, sir.  i'll get you some black coffee, sir.
did you see all this stuff in the papers?
arthur wants to quit!
arthur! who's arthur?
he's the shipping clerk at the tallow works. wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
what do i care about arthur! did you see this stuff in the paper? how'd it get in there? what'd you do last night? who were you talking to?
and what'd you do to those bodyguards? they quit this morning. said you locked them up.
oh, they insisted on following me.
what do you think bodyguards are for?
what do they mean by this - "cinderella man!"
are those stories true?
i don't remember. "cinderella man!" what do they mean by that?
they'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. they've got you down as a sap.
i think i'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
no, you don't! get this clear: socking people is no solution for anything.
sometimes it's the only solution.
not editors. take my word for it. not editors!
if they're going to poke fun at me, i'm going to—
listen. listen, longfellow. you've got brains, kid. you'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. don't talk to anybody! these newshounds are out gunning for you.
but what about this "cinderella man"?
that's my job. i'll take care of that. i'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. but i can't do anything if you go around talking to people. will you promise me to be careful from now on?
yes, i guess i'll have to.
thank you.  if you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
cobb's right. i mustn't talk to anybody.
miss dawson on the phone, sir.
who? miss dawson?
yes, sir.
fine. i'll talk to her. give me the phone, quick. she's the only one i'm going to talk to from now on.
it's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
i enjoy it.
the aquarium was swell. if i lived in new york, i'd go there every day. i'll bet you do.
well, i'd like to - but i have a job to think of.
it don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
babe ought to get him drunk again.
sure. i met you.
oh. what's happening about the opera?
oh, that - well, we had another meeting. i told them i'd go on being chairman if—
i told 'em i'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
what did they say?
gosh, you look pretty tonight.
what did they say?
huh?  oh. they said i was crazy. said i wanted to run it like a grocery store.
what are they going to do?
do you always wear your hair like that?
have you seen the papers?
uh-huh.
that's what i like about you. you think about a man's feelings. i'd like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose that's writing that stuff—
would you like to walk the rest of the way? it's so nice out.
yes.
yeah, let's.
there you are. grant's tomb. i hope you're not disappointed.
it's wonderful.
to most people, it's an awful letdown.
huh?
i say, to most people it's a washout.
that depends on what they see.
now, what do you see?
me?  oh, i see a small ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. i see thousands of marching men. i see general lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and i can see the beginning of a new nation, like abraham lincoln said. and i can see that ohio boy being inaugurated as president—  things like that can only happen in a country like america.
don't want to be critical, john, but here it is—
yes, i know. a week's gone by and we haven't got the power of attorney yet!
yes, but you said—
i don't care what i said. i can't strangle him, can i!
relatives of old man semple.
they keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
nuisance value?
they say if it hadn't been for deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
nuisance value.  maybe they have! maybe they have! maybe they have!  mr. and mrs. semple, please. how do you do?
there's times square.
you can almost spit on it, can't you?
why don't you try?
you're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
i'm not worrying any more. i suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. you don't believe all that stuff, do you?
oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
yeah, i guess so. what puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
here's a nice place.
yeah. anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
you know, you said something to me when you first met me that i've thought about a great deal.
what's that?
you said i was a lady in distress.
oh, that—
what did you mean by that?
nothing—
no. are you?
no.
you don't go out with girls very much, do you?
i haven't.
why not?
oh, i don't know.
you must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. don't you like them?
i haven't met anybody here that i like, particularly. they all seem to have the st. vitus dance.[12]  except you, of course.  people here are funny. they work so hard at living - they forget how to live  last night, after i left you, i was walking along and looking at the tall buildings and i got to thinking about what thoreau said. they created a lot of grand palaces here - but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them.
i'd rather have mandrake falls.
i'm from a small town too, you know.
really?
probably as small as mandrake falls.
gosh! what do you know about that!
i've often thought about going back.
you have?
oh, yes. i used to have a lot of fun there when i was a little girl. i used to love to go fishing with my father. that's funny. he was a lot like you, my father was. talked like you, too. sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. and after awhile, for no reason, i'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. he never said very much but once i remember him saying: "no matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
he sounds like a person worth while knowing.
he played in the town band, too.
he did? i play the tuba—
yeah, i know.
what did he play?
the drums. he taught me to play some.
he did?
yes. i can do "swanee river." would you like to hear me?
sure!
oh, i suppose you could do better.
sure. i can sing "humoresque."
"humoresque"? i'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
sure. look! you sing it over again, and i'll do "humoresque" with you.
it had better be good.
i wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
shhh!
what's the matter, hon?
nothing.
what's up, babe? something's eating you.
no. it's nothing.
my unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
don't be ridiculous.
you haven't gotten very far, have you? that's where you were an hour ago. come on, let's knock off and go down to joe's. the gang's waiting for us.
i can't write it, mabel! i don't know what's the matter with me.
couldn't sleep. kinda wanted to talk to you. do you mind?
no - not at all. i couldn't sleep either.
i wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  huh? well, i don't know what i'd do without you. you've made up for all the fakes that i've met.
well, that's very nice. thank you.
you know what i've been doing since i got home? been working on a poem.  it's about you.  sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so i write 'em.
i'd like to read it some time.
good night.
mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. i can't make him out.
uh-huh.
i'm crucifying him.
people have been crucified before.
why? why do we have to do it?
you started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
yeah, then what?
search me. ask the gypsies.
here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. to us he looks like a freak. you know what he told me tonight? he said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
the guy's balmy.
is he? yeah, i thought so, too. i tried to laugh, but i couldn't. it stuck in my throat.
aw, cut it out, will you? you'll get me thinking about charlie again.
he's got goodness, mabel. do you know what that is?
huh?
no - of course you don't. we've forgotten. we're too busy being smart-alecks.  too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
madame pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
who?
madame pomponi. she says everything is all set for the reception.
what do you mean by coming in here when i'm playing?
but she's on the telephone—
get out.  the evil finger's on you. get out!
hey, did you hear that?
what, sir?
why, that's an echo, sir!
you try it.
me, sir?
yeah.
you try it.
me, sir?
you're a fool, babe.
i just couldn't stand seeing him again.
running away is no solution.
what'll i tell him if he calls up?
tell him i had to leave suddenly. i got a job in china - some place.
you're acting like a school girl.
what else can i do? keeping this up is no good. he's bound to find out sometime.  at least i can save him that .
yeah. mac threw cobb out again.
boy, was he burning.
just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot.
just a minute. no, you don't.
we're not going out tonight.
you're mabel - her sister - aren't you?
huh? oh, yes - yes, of course. her sister. yes, i've been her sister for a long time.
is she home?
yeah. what?
is mary home?
why there she is!  of course she's home.  stupid of me . . .
hello.
i didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
oh, i wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. so i threw them out!
you threw them out!
you mean—  —by the neck or something?
sure. they got on my nerves, so i threw 'em out.
i don't mind though. i had a lot of fun doing it.
would you like to go for a walk?
yes, if it isn't too late.
i'll get my hat.
nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
yes, lovely. we've had a lot of nice weather lately.
it would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
oh yes, i think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. a nice long one.
ready?
gosh, she looks better every time i see her.
thank you.
goodnight. don't worry. i won't keep her out late.
thank you so much. good night.
ow! my foot's asleep!
come on - let's go!
the reason why i wanted to take a walk, mary, is 'cause i wanted to talk to you.
let's just walk, okay?
all right.
mary, i'm going home.
are you? when?
in a day or so, i think.
i don't blame you.
do you mind if i talk to you, mary? you don't have to pay any attention to me.
no, i don't mind.
all my life, i've wanted somebody to talk to. back in mandrake falls, i always used to talk to a girl.
a girl?
oh, an imaginary one. i used to hike a lot through the woods and i'd always take this girl with me so i could talk to her. i'd show her my pet trees and things. sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
well, here we are again.
yes, here we are again.  good night.
mary - i - excuse me—
would you like to read it? it's to you.
yes, of course.
what's bothering you, huh?
last night he proposed to me.
proposed to you! you mean he asked you to marry him?
yes.
why, babe - that's terrific!  "cinderella man woos mystery girl! who is the mysterious girl that—"
print one line of that, and i'll blow your place up!
sorry, babe. sorry. it would have made a swell story. i just got carried away. that's too bad. so he proposed to you, huh?  what a twist! you set out to nail him - and he—
yeah. funny twist, isn't it?
say, you haven't gone and fallen for that mug, have you?
what're you going to do?
i'm going to tell him the truth.
tell him you're babe bennett? tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
i'm having lunch with him today. he expects an answer. it's going to be pretty.
you're crazy! you can't do that!
he'll probably kick me right down the stairs. i only hope he does.
i'll put you on another job. you need never see him again, eh?
that's the rub.
oh, as bad as that, huh?
telling him is the long shot - i'm going to take it.
how's it going? okay?
yes, quite all right. thank you, sir.
gold, eh?
yes, sir.
fourteen carat?
yes, sir.
is that the best you've got?
oh, yes sir.
those flowers are too high. won't be able to see her.  get a smaller bowl, will you?
a smaller bowl of flowers.
stuff, sir?
that goo. that stuff that tastes like soap.
oh, yes, sir. here it is, sir. the pate de fois gras, sir.
yeah, that's fine. have a lot of it because she likes it.
yes, sir.
sit over there, will you?
me sir?
yes.
how is this, sir?
perfect! perfect!
i wish you luck, sir.
thank you. now don't touch a thing. leave everything as it is.
yes, sir. what is it, sir? anything happened3
anything happened? i've got to get dressed! i can't meet her like this!
but she isn't due for an hour, sir.
an hour? what's an hour! you know how time flies, walter. my tie? get it.
yes, sir. very good, sir. here it is right here, sir. there, sir.
just as i suspected, wise guy! i don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
will you tell the gentleman i'm not in?
mary dawson, huh? mary dawson, my eye. that dame took you for a sleigh ride that new york will laugh about for years. she's the slickest, two- timing, double-crossing—
she's the star reporter on the mail. every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. she's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "cinderella man." you've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
shut up!
this is for you , mac. the names of all the headwaiters in town. you can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
aw, listen babe, i can't let you quit now. you're not going through with this thing, are you?
it's for you. in a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing.
hello . . .
hello, mary?
oh, hello darling.
pack my things, walter. i'm going home.
yes, sir.
you shouldn't be running away like this. what's going to happen to the estate?
they can have the estate.
you can't come up here!
let me go! i wanna see him!
he's not home, i tell you!
i wanna see that guy!
we'll send for the police!
let me go!
let him alone.
let me alone!  if you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  how did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  get a kick out of it, huh? got a big laugh?  did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! no!
shall i call the police, sir?
no!  what do you want!!
yeah - that's all that's worrying you. what do i want?  a chance to feed a wife and kids! i'm a farmer. a job! that's what i want!
a farmer, eh! you're a moocher, that's what you are! i wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! you're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
sure - everybody's a moocher to you. a mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you!
are you married?
yes, sir.
any children?
no, no children.
all right, mr. dodsworth. i think you'll qualify.  take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
thank you very much.
next, please.
here's the order for the plows. we got a good price on them.
that's fine. thanks. i'll look 'em over later.
oh, mr. deeds—
—my wife wanted me to tell you she—  —she prays for you every night.
well, thanks, i - uh—  how do you do? what is your name?
charlie, we're off! papers all set?
all set.
okay, then. go to it.  and, charlie—
yeah?
find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
okay.
what is your name?
christian svenson.
farmer?
yes, ma'am.
where is your farm?
south dakota north.
south dakota - north?
south dakota - but on the top.
oh. oh!
what about your knocking off for lunch?
not hungry. i want to get through this work in a hurry, and then i want to go home. what price did you get on those trucks?
come on, come on. what are you trying to do, kid? keel over? you haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
well, maybe i will have a sandwich.  do you mind waiting a few minutes?
cobb! get lunch for the rest of them.
what? there must be 2000 of them out there.
well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
okay, santa claus. 2000 lunches.
miss bennett please!
this is outrageous!
it's obviously a frameup! they're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
your honor!
thank you, your honor. are you employed by the morning mail?
no!
you are under oath, miss bennett. i ask you again - are you employed by the morning mail?
no! i resigned last week!
were you given an assignment to follow the activities of longfellow deeds?
yes.
did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
yes!
are these the articles?
yes!
were you present when all these things took place?
yes!
are they true!
no!!
but they did take place?
they're colored! just to make him look silly!
and you saw them happen?
yes, but i—
that's all, miss bennett.
it isn't all! i'd like to explain—
that's all, miss bennett. that's all.
the falkner sisters are rather timid, your honor, and wish to be together. if the court pleases, i will only have one of them testify.
yes! yes! let's get on with it.
since he was born.
yes. elsie taggart was the midwife.
he was a seven-months baby.
most every day.
sometimes twice.
must we have the echo?
suppose you just answer, miss jane. now, will you tell the court what everybody at home thinks of longfellow deeds?
they think he's pixilated.
oh yes, pixilated.
he's what?
what was that you said he was?
pixilated.
uh-huh.
he walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
sometimes he whistles.
and sings.
for no reason, i guess. he always does it. we always run into the house when we see him coming.
never can tell what he's going to do.
he sure is pixilated.
oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
you remember, dr. fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples.
uh-huh.
especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
oh, yes. yes, of course dr. von holler. very interesting.
it reminds me very much of this one. nicht wahr?
ja.
it takes so long to detect them—  —because their mood changes so often and so quickly. now, your honor, may i show you? may i use the chart?
oh, thank you!
your honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. i object.
your honor, this is absurd. the woman's obviously in love with him.
what's that got to do with it?
well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
what's that got to do with it?
you are , aren't you?
yes!!!
your honor—
yes?
i'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
take the stand!
proceed.
well, i don't know where to begin. there's been so many things said about me that i—
a what?
an o-filler. you fill in all the spaces in the o's, with your pencil.  i was watching you.
mr. deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
oh, yes. yes. about my throwing those people out of my house. mrs. pomponi told the truth. i did throw them out because i didn't want the party in the first place. i didn't invite anybody. mrs. pomponi did all that. they just came to see what kind of a freak the "cinderella man" was. i don't know how people like that are supposed to act, your honor, but if that pomponi woman is an example, i'll stick to simple folks. she just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. if i were a friend of hers, i'd have her examined.
your honor, i object.
proceed.
now about the falkner sisters. that's kind of funny. i mean about mr. cedar going all the way to mandrake falls to bring them here. do you mind if i talk to them?
not at all.
why, you own it, longfellow.
yes, you own it.
why, you've always been pixilated, longfellow.
always.
why, everybody in mandrake falls in pixilated - except us.
uh-huh.
oh, yes.
yes, indeedy.
mr. deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. this rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. it is, to say the least, most uncommon.
oh yes, i was getting to that, your honor.
please, mr. cedar!  proceed.
personally, i don't know what mr. cedar's raving about. from what i can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
it's a lie!
mr. cedar!
mr. deeds is drawing on his warped imagination!
you will please permit mr. deeds to finish.
but your honor—
mr. cedar!
anything else, mr. deeds?
no.  yes. there's just one more thing i'd like to get off my chest before i finish.
proceed.
thank you, your honor.
he's still pixilated.
he sure is.
newspaperman?
wants to know who the heir is.
hang up.
sorry, mac, i can't. yeah, mac. sure, but i ain't the attorney—
hang up.
mr. cedar is, and i haven't seen him in two days.  listen, cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
i'm not interested in the newspapers.
but it's a great story. somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
yes, i know. my first concern is to locate the lucky man. when i do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
it's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in.
thank heaven.
better wire him right away, john.
i'll do no such thing. i'm going there myself. you're going with me too, anderson - and you too, cobb.
yes?
make three reservations on the first train out to mandrake falls, vermont.
where?
mandrake falls.  m-a-n—
that's pretty.
are you sure this is the town he lives in?
good morning.
morning, neighbors. morning.
i say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of longfellow deeds?
deeds?
yes.
yes, sir. yes, indeedy. everyone knows deeds.
yes, i—
we'd like to get in touch with him. it's very important.
who's that?
deeds! who do you think i'm talking about?
oh, yes - deeds. fine fellow. very democratic. you won't have no trouble at all. talk to anybody.
i guess we'd better try somebody else.
no, we won't! the next time that jumping jack comes out, i'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
is mr. deeds in?
no - he's over to the park arranging for the bazaar, so's to raise money for the fire engine.  mal, you shoulda knowed he was in the park.
come in, please. come in. can i get you a cup of tea?
no, thanks.
sit down. sure i couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
that's very kind of you. are you related to him?
no, i'm his housekeeper.
well, we'd like to find out something about him. what does he do for a living?
he and jim mason own the tallow works. but that's not where he makes his money. he makes most of it from his poetry.
who are they?
i don't know.
mr. longfellow deeds?
yes.
how do you do.
how do you do.
i'm john cedar - of the new york firm of cedar, cedar, cedar and budington.
new mouthpiece. been waiting two weeks for this. kids keep swiping them all the time. they use 'em for bean shooters.  what can i do for you gentlemen?
you gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
i'd like to ask you a few questions.
all right.
mr. deeds, are you the son of dr. joseph and mary deeds?
yes.
are your parents living?
why, no.
mr. deeds, does the name of martin w. semple mean anything to you?
not much. he's an uncle of mine, i think. i never saw him, but my mother's name was semple, you know.
well, he passed on. he was killed in a motor accident in italy.
he was? gee, that's too bad. if there's anything i can do to—
how about lunch? are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
of course they're going to stay.  she's got some fresh orange layer cake. you know, with the thick stuff on the top?  sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.
perhaps you didn't hear what i said, mr. deeds! the whole semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
oh, yes, i heard you all right. $20,000,000. that's quite a lot, isn't it?
oh, it'll do in a pinch.
yes, indeed. i wonder why he left me all that money? i don't need it.
mr. cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
buffer?
yeah. a glorified doormat.
yes. you see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. the world's full of pests. then there's the newspapers to handle. one must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
cedar, cedar, cedar and budington. funny, i can't think of a rhyme for budington.
why should you?
well, whenever i run across a funny name, i always like to poke around for a rhyme. don't you?
nah.
i've got one for cobb—
"there once was a man named cobb, who kept semple away from the mob. came the turn of the tide and semple - he died - and now poor cobb's out of a job!"
sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
huh?
i've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
oh, i don't mean that. i'm sure i'm going to need your help.
oh, that's different if it's just poetry.
are you a married man, mr. deeds?
who - me? no.
no, he's too fussy for that. that's what's the matter with him. there are lots of nice girls right here in mandrake falls who're dying to be married—
don't pay any attention to her.
he's got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
now you keep out of this!
saving a lady in distress, eh? well, i suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  incidentally, we'd better get started. you'll have to pack.
what for?
you're going to new york with us.
when?
this afternoon - at four o'clock.
i don't think we've got any suitcases.
well, we could borrow a couple from mrs. simpson. you know, she went to niagara falls last year.
i'm kind of nervous. i've never been away from mandrake falls in my life. kind of like to see grant's tomb, though.
i can understand that.  we'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  congratulations, mr. deeds. you're one of the richest men in the country. we'll see you later.  goodbye and thank you.
see you later, kid.
hear what he said? you know how much twenty million is?
i don't care how much it is. you sit right there and eat your lunch. you haven't touched a thing.
i can't find him.
you can't?
i looked everywhere. i even went to his house. it's locked up.
look!
what?
that tuba player!
have a drink?
no, thanks.
will you have a cigar?
no, thank you.
i wouldn't worry if i were you. of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. so don't worry. leave everything to me.
oh, i wasn't worried about that.
no?
i was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
we've got nothing to worry about. he's as naive as a child.
john—
close that door.  will you get mrs. cedar on the phone, please?
come on, john. what happened?
the smartest thing i ever did was to make that trip.
i know, budington. we can't afford to have the books investigated right now. you must have said that a thousand times already.
but what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh—
well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
but a half million dollars! my goodness, where are we going to get—
will you stop worrying! it was i who got old man semple to turn everything over to us, wasn't it? and who got the power of attorney from him ! all right, and i'll get it again!  i'll take it easy. those books'll never leave this office.
look, i can do it!
what's gotten into you, babe? i remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let cobb get away with a thing like this.
oh, he's not getting away with anything.
listen, babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have—
can i have a month's vacation?
with pay!
with pay!
uh-huh.
leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow.
now you're talking, babe. i'll keep the whole front page open. what are you going to do?
have lunch.
it's merely a suggestion. i don't wish to press the point, mr. deeds, but if you'll give me your power of attorney we'll take care of everything. it'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. strangest kind of people. salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. i haven't had a minute to myself. haven't seen grant's tomb yet.
well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. he left everything to us. he traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. you should do the same thing, mr. deeds.
besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
yes. that is to say—
well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
oh - nothing. no extra charge.
that involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
yes, but that's an added service a firm like cedar, cedar, cedar and budington usually donates.
budington. funny, i can't think of a rhyme for budington yet.
the gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. they're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
they are? i forgot all about them.  what do you think they want?
well, your uncle was chairman of the board of directors. they probably expect you to carry on.
i'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
thanks  oh, did you send that telegram to jim mason?
jim mason?  oh, yeah. yeah. no, i didn't send it. i've got it written out, though. here it is.  "arthur's been with the tallow works too long. stop. don't think we should fire him. longfellow."
fine. send it right away. i don't want him to fire arthur.
oh, sure. sure. we don't want to fire arthur.
he was the last baby my father delivered, arthur was.
i think you ought to give this matter some thought, mr. deeds.
huh?
i mean, about the power of attorney.
oh, yes. yes, i will.
why not? who is he?
a lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  tell him to see me at my office.
well, if he has a claim, we'd better see him.  send him in.
he's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, mr. deeds.
how can he make any trouble for me? i haven't done anything.
mrs. semple?
yes. your uncle's common-law wife. she has a legal claim on the estate.
i leave it to you, mr. deeds. can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
what kind of wife did you say she was?
common-law wife. on top of that, there's a child.
a child? my uncle's?
yes, sir.
that's awful. the poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
i'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, mr. deeds.
if she was his wife, she should have all the money. that's only fair. i don't want a penny of it.
you'd better get right down there. that opera mob is about to break into the mad song from "lucia."[2]
oh, i don't want to keep them waiting any longer. they're important people.  i wish you'd go along with me, cobb. they're all strangers to me.
well, what about it, mr. deeds?
you'll excuse me, won't you? i'll be right back.
gee, i'm busy. did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
uh-huh.
that's funny. why is that?
why do mice go where there's cheese?[3]
i'm chairman?
oh yes, of course - you've just been elected.
i'm chairman.
wait a minute. what does the chairman do?
why, the chairman presides at the meetings.
that's what i thought. if you don't mind, i'm rather interested in the treasurer's report. i'd like to hear it.
you see, mr. deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
it isn't? what is it conducted for?
why, it's an artistic institution—
we own an opera house, don't we?
we provide opera.
but you charge. i mean, you sell tickets?
that's impossible. the opera has never paid.
well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
the wrong kind! there isn't any wrong or right kind. opera is opera!
i guess it is. but i personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. that wouldn't be common sense. incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
me?!
naturally.
excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
now, where were we?
you see, mr. deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
why not?
because it just isn't a business, that's all!
well, maybe it isn't to you, but it certainly is a business to me, if i have to make up a loss of $180,000. if it's losing that much money, there must be something wrong. maybe you charge too much. maybe you're selling bad merchandise. maybe lots of things. i don't know. you see, i expect to do a lot of good with that money. and i can't afford to put it into anything that i don't look into. that's my decision for the time being, gentlemen. goodbye, and thank you for making me chairman.
sorry to keep you waiting so long. those opera people are funny. they wanted me to put up $180,000.
what about it, mr. deeds?
why, i turned them down, naturally.
no, i mean - about my client.
oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
tails tonight, sir?
what - tails?  why, that's a monkey suit![5] do you want people to laugh at me?  i never wore one of those things in my life.
yes, sir.
of course, we don't want to appear greedy, mr. deeds.
huh?
i say we don't want to appear greedy.
oh. that.
what do you think you're doing?
why, i'm assisting you, sir.
get up from there. i don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. get up from there!
yes, sir.
imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
mrs. semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
and don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
no, sir.
excuse me. what did you say?
mrs. semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
one-third? that's about $7,000,000 isn't it?
well, we didn't expect that much. i'm sure i can get her to settle quietly for one million.
you're making a mistake, mr. deeds.
oh no, i'm not. i don't like your face. besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. i'm surprised that mr. cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
now wait a minute, buddy—
there's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. when the servant comes in, mr. hallor, i'm going to ask him to show you to the door. many people don't know where it is.
no use in getting tough. that'll get you nowhere, mr. deeds.  you know, we've got letters.
will you show mr. hallor to the front door?
yes, sir.
i can't hold out on you any longer. lamb bites wolf.  beautiful.
only common sense.
i can't hold out any longer either, mr. deeds.  being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
you're not my attorney yet, mr. cedar. not till i find out what's on your mind. suppose you get the books straightened out quick so i can have a look at them.
yes, of course, if you wish. but you must be prepared. this sort of thing will be daily routine.  if it becomes annoying, you let me know. goodbye, mr. deeds. goodbye, sir.
well, how about tonight? what would you like in the way of entertainment?
entertainment?
your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. how would you like yours? dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
what're you talking about?
women! ever heard of 'em?
oh.
name your poison and i'll supply it.
some other time, cobb. some other time.
okay, you're the boss.  when your blood begins to boil, yell out. i'll be seeing you!
he talks about women as if they were cattle.
every man to his taste, sir.
tell me, walter, are all those stories i hear about my uncle true?
well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
twenty! what did he do with them?
that was something i was never able to find out, sir.
no. don't ever want to go out without telling us.
who are you?
yeah, mr. cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
that's very nice of mr. cobb - but i don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
that's going to be fun.
some people like it.
put that away, slug!  at your service!
i got a trunk in that room. will you get it out for me?
certainly.
i suppose it's going to be the same old thing.
i tell you that dame's nuts.
right.
you fainted.
oh, did i? i'm sorry . . .
no, thank you. i'll be all right.
look, this is my house. i'd like to—
oh, no, really - i'll be all right.
what happened?
well, i guess i walked too much. i've been looking for a job all day. i found one, too. i start tomorrow.  you've been awfully kind. thank you very much.
come on, come on!
hurry up!
feel better now?
mmm, it tastes so good. mr. deeds, i don't know how i can ever thank you.
tell me more about yourself.
well, i guess i've told you almost everything there is to tell. my folks live in a small town near hartford. i'm down here alone trying to make a living.  oh, i'm really just a nobody.
oh, that was so lovely. thank you.
you were a lady in distress, weren't you?
what?
oh - uh - nothing.
huh? on, no. nobody important.
be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
uh-huh.
i'm a writer myself, you know.
uh-huh.
i write poetry.
uh-huh.
you've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  all those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
no. that is, i didn't—  until i met you. i like talking to you, though—  imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
brookfield just came in.
oh, the poet? where?
over at that big round table. the one that looks like a poodle.
look - there's brookfield, the poet.
really?
no - i don't want it, thank you.
why, you must drink! all poets drink!
well, i don't know. i—
mr. morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off.
yes. have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
well, i play the tuba.
no.
you mean to tell me you don't carry a pocketful around with you?
look, he's temperamental.
yeah, what if i am? what about it?
there's just one thing more. if it weren't for miss dawson being here with me, i'd probably bump your heads together.
oh, i don't mind.
say fellow, you neglected me - and i feel very put out.  look, sock it right there, will you? lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard.
that's all right. i got it off my chest.
the difference between them and me is i know when i've been a skunk. you take me to the nearest news- stand and i'll eat a pack of your postcards raw. raw!
oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. pal, you've added ten years to my life!  a poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! delicious!  you're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
thanks, but miss dawson and i are going out to see the sights.
fine, fine. swell, you just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and i'd like to reciprocate. listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet—  —thanks - and i'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
i'd kind of like to see grant's tomb - and the statue of liberty.
well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the leaning tower of pisa - you'll mount mt. everest. i'll show you the pyramids and all the little pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
binge?
yes. i mean the real mccoy. listen, you play saloon with me, and i'll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in new york. we'll go on a twister that'll make omar the soused philosopher of persia[7] look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet.
that ought to be fun.
fun?  say, listen, i'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  boy! boy! my headpiece!
cinderella man! that's sensational, babe! sensational!
it took some high-powered acting, believe me.
did it?
i was the world's sweetest ingenue.
is he really that big a sap?
he's the original. there are no carbon copies of that one.
cinderella man! babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. can you imagine cobb's face when he reads this?
if we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
how'd you get the picture?
had the boys follow us.
marvelous!  "at two o'clock this morning, mr. deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. when asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'i just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'"  beautiful! what happened after that?
i don't know. i had to duck to get the story out. he was so far along he never even missed me.
when're you going to see him again?
tonight, maybe.  i'll phone him at noon.  oh, my lunch hour. i'm a stenographer, you know. mary dawson.
you're a genius, babe - a genius!
i even moved into mabel dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy cobb might start looking around.
good! good!  stay there. don't show your face down here. i'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. they'll never know where the stories are coming from. stick close to him, babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. we'll have the other papers crazy.  babe, i could kiss you!
oh, no. no. our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
sure.
with pay!  she is out the door.
you'll get it, babe. you'll get it.
mr. deeds - mr. deeds, sir - you really must get up. it's late!
you're walter, aren't you?
yes, sir.
i just wanted to make sure.
yes, sir.
what's that?
a prairie oyster, sir.[10]
prairie? oysters?
yes, sir. it makes the head feel smaller.
oh. oh!  has miss dawson called yet?
miss dawson, sir? no, sir. no miss dawson has called, sir.
she was a lady in distress. she wouldn't let me help her. got a lot of pride. i like that.
oh, i do too, sir.
i'd better call her up and apologize. i don't remember taking her home last night.
i'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
what do you mean? i remember everything!  hand me my pants - i wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
you have no pants, sir.
you came home last night - without them.
i did what!
as a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. you were in your - uh - shorts. yes, sir.
oh, don't be silly, walter. i couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. i'd be arrested.
that's what the two policemen said, sir.
what two policemen?
the ones who brought you home, sir. they said you and another gentleman kept walking up and down the streets, shouting: "back to nature! clothes are a blight on civilization! back to nature!"
please!
but how'll i put on the slipper, sir?
yes, sir. i beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
looking for?
you kept searching me last night, sir. going through my pockets. you said you were looking for a rhyme for budington.
better bring me some coffee, walter.
very good, sir.  oh, i beg pardon. a telegram came for you, sir.  i'll get you some black coffee, sir.
did you see all this stuff in the papers?
arthur wants to quit!
arthur! who's arthur?
he's the shipping clerk at the tallow works. wants a $2 raise - or he'll quit.
what do i care about arthur! did you see this stuff in the paper? how'd it get in there? what'd you do last night? who were you talking to?
and what'd you do to those bodyguards? they quit this morning. said you locked them up.
oh, they insisted on following me.
what do you think bodyguards are for?
what do they mean by this - "cinderella man!"
are those stories true?
i don't remember. "cinderella man!" what do they mean by that?
they'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. they've got you down as a sap.
i think i'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
no, you don't! get this clear: socking people is no solution for anything.
sometimes it's the only solution.
not editors. take my word for it. not editors!
if they're going to poke fun at me, i'm going to—
listen. listen, longfellow. you've got brains, kid. you'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. don't talk to anybody! these newshounds are out gunning for you.
but what about this "cinderella man"?
that's my job. i'll take care of that. i'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. but i can't do anything if you go around talking to people. will you promise me to be careful from now on?
yes, i guess i'll have to.
thank you.  if you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
cobb's right. i mustn't talk to anybody.
miss dawson on the phone, sir.
who? miss dawson?
yes, sir.
fine. i'll talk to her. give me the phone, quick. she's the only one i'm going to talk to from now on.
it's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
i enjoy it.
the aquarium was swell. if i lived in new york, i'd go there every day. i'll bet you do.
well, i'd like to - but i have a job to think of.
it don't look as though we're gonna get any pictures tonight.
babe ought to get him drunk again.
sure. i met you.
oh. what's happening about the opera?
oh, that - well, we had another meeting. i told them i'd go on being chairman if—
i told 'em i'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
what did they say?
gosh, you look pretty tonight.
what did they say?
huh?  oh. they said i was crazy. said i wanted to run it like a grocery store.
what are they going to do?
do you always wear your hair like that?
have you seen the papers?
uh-huh.
that's what i like about you. you think about a man's feelings. i'd like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose that's writing that stuff—
would you like to walk the rest of the way? it's so nice out.
yes.
yeah, let's.
there you are. grant's tomb. i hope you're not disappointed.
it's wonderful.
to most people, it's an awful letdown.
huh?
i say, to most people it's a washout.
that depends on what they see.
now, what do you see?
me?  oh, i see a small ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. i see thousands of marching men. i see general lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and i can see the beginning of a new nation, like abraham lincoln said. and i can see that ohio boy being inaugurated as president—  things like that can only happen in a country like america.
don't want to be critical, john, but here it is—
yes, i know. a week's gone by and we haven't got the power of attorney yet!
yes, but you said—
i don't care what i said. i can't strangle him, can i!
relatives of old man semple.
they keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
nuisance value?
they say if it hadn't been for deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
nuisance value.  maybe they have! maybe they have! maybe they have!  mr. and mrs. semple, please. how do you do?
there's times square.
you can almost spit on it, can't you?
why don't you try?
you're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
i'm not worrying any more. i suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. you don't believe all that stuff, do you?
oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
yeah, i guess so. what puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
here's a nice place.
yeah. anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
you know, you said something to me when you first met me that i've thought about a great deal.
what's that?
you said i was a lady in distress.
oh, that—
what did you mean by that?
nothing—
no. are you?
no.
you don't go out with girls very much, do you?
i haven't.
why not?
oh, i don't know.
you must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. don't you like them?
i haven't met anybody here that i like, particularly. they all seem to have the st. vitus dance.[12]  except you, of course.  people here are funny. they work so hard at living - they forget how to live  last night, after i left you, i was walking along and looking at the tall buildings and i got to thinking about what thoreau said. they created a lot of grand palaces here - but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them.
i'd rather have mandrake falls.
i'm from a small town too, you know.
really?
probably as small as mandrake falls.
gosh! what do you know about that!
i've often thought about going back.
you have?
oh, yes. i used to have a lot of fun there when i was a little girl. i used to love to go fishing with my father. that's funny. he was a lot like you, my father was. talked like you, too. sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. and after awhile, for no reason, i'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. he never said very much but once i remember him saying: "no matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
he sounds like a person worth while knowing.
he played in the town band, too.
he did? i play the tuba—
yeah, i know.
what did he play?
the drums. he taught me to play some.
he did?
yes. i can do "swanee river." would you like to hear me?
sure!
oh, i suppose you could do better.
sure. i can sing "humoresque."
"humoresque"? i'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
sure. look! you sing it over again, and i'll do "humoresque" with you.
it had better be good.
i wonder if they'd want to make it a quartet.
shhh!
what's the matter, hon?
nothing.
what's up, babe? something's eating you.
no. it's nothing.
my unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
don't be ridiculous.
you haven't gotten very far, have you? that's where you were an hour ago. come on, let's knock off and go down to joe's. the gang's waiting for us.
i can't write it, mabel! i don't know what's the matter with me.
couldn't sleep. kinda wanted to talk to you. do you mind?
no - not at all. i couldn't sleep either.
i wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  huh? well, i don't know what i'd do without you. you've made up for all the fakes that i've met.
well, that's very nice. thank you.
you know what i've been doing since i got home? been working on a poem.  it's about you.  sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so i write 'em.
i'd like to read it some time.
good night.
mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. i can't make him out.
uh-huh.
i'm crucifying him.
people have been crucified before.
why? why do we have to do it?
you started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
yeah, then what?
search me. ask the gypsies.
here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. to us he looks like a freak. you know what he told me tonight? he said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
the guy's balmy.
is he? yeah, i thought so, too. i tried to laugh, but i couldn't. it stuck in my throat.
aw, cut it out, will you? you'll get me thinking about charlie again.
he's got goodness, mabel. do you know what that is?
huh?
no - of course you don't. we've forgotten. we're too busy being smart-alecks.  too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
madame pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
who?
madame pomponi. she says everything is all set for the reception.
what do you mean by coming in here when i'm playing?
but she's on the telephone—
get out.  the evil finger's on you. get out!
hey, did you hear that?
what, sir?
why, that's an echo, sir!
you try it.
me, sir?
yeah.
you try it.
me, sir?
you're a fool, babe.
i just couldn't stand seeing him again.
running away is no solution.
what'll i tell him if he calls up?
tell him i had to leave suddenly. i got a job in china - some place.
you're acting like a school girl.
what else can i do? keeping this up is no good. he's bound to find out sometime.  at least i can save him that .
yeah. mac threw cobb out again.
boy, was he burning.
just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot.
just a minute. no, you don't.
we're not going out tonight.
you're mabel - her sister - aren't you?
huh? oh, yes - yes, of course. her sister. yes, i've been her sister for a long time.
is she home?
yeah. what?
is mary home?
why there she is!  of course she's home.  stupid of me . . .
hello.
i didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
oh, i wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. so i threw them out!
you threw them out!
you mean—  —by the neck or something?
sure. they got on my nerves, so i threw 'em out.
i don't mind though. i had a lot of fun doing it.
would you like to go for a walk?
yes, if it isn't too late.
i'll get my hat.
nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
yes, lovely. we've had a lot of nice weather lately.
it would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
oh yes, i think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. a nice long one.
ready?
gosh, she looks better every time i see her.
thank you.
goodnight. don't worry. i won't keep her out late.
thank you so much. good night.
ow! my foot's asleep!
come on - let's go!
the reason why i wanted to take a walk, mary, is 'cause i wanted to talk to you.
let's just walk, okay?
all right.
mary, i'm going home.
are you? when?
in a day or so, i think.
i don't blame you.
do you mind if i talk to you, mary? you don't have to pay any attention to me.
no, i don't mind.
all my life, i've wanted somebody to talk to. back in mandrake falls, i always used to talk to a girl.
a girl?
oh, an imaginary one. i used to hike a lot through the woods and i'd always take this girl with me so i could talk to her. i'd show her my pet trees and things. sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
well, here we are again.
yes, here we are again.  good night.
mary - i - excuse me—
would you like to read it? it's to you.
yes, of course.
what's bothering you, huh?
last night he proposed to me.
proposed to you! you mean he asked you to marry him?
yes.
why, babe - that's terrific!  "cinderella man woos mystery girl! who is the mysterious girl that—"
print one line of that, and i'll blow your place up!
sorry, babe. sorry. it would have made a swell story. i just got carried away. that's too bad. so he proposed to you, huh?  what a twist! you set out to nail him - and he—
yeah. funny twist, isn't it?
say, you haven't gone and fallen for that mug, have you?
what're you going to do?
i'm going to tell him the truth.
tell him you're babe bennett? tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
i'm having lunch with him today. he expects an answer. it's going to be pretty.
you're crazy! you can't do that!
he'll probably kick me right down the stairs. i only hope he does.
i'll put you on another job. you need never see him again, eh?
that's the rub.
oh, as bad as that, huh?
telling him is the long shot - i'm going to take it.
how's it going? okay?
yes, quite all right. thank you, sir.
gold, eh?
yes, sir.
fourteen carat?
yes, sir.
is that the best you've got?
oh, yes sir.
those flowers are too high. won't be able to see her.  get a smaller bowl, will you?
a smaller bowl of flowers.
stuff, sir?
that goo. that stuff that tastes like soap.
oh, yes, sir. here it is, sir. the pate de fois gras, sir.
yeah, that's fine. have a lot of it because she likes it.
yes, sir.
sit over there, will you?
me sir?
yes.
how is this, sir?
perfect! perfect!
i wish you luck, sir.
thank you. now don't touch a thing. leave everything as it is.
yes, sir. what is it, sir? anything happened3
anything happened? i've got to get dressed! i can't meet her like this!
but she isn't due for an hour, sir.
an hour? what's an hour! you know how time flies, walter. my tie? get it.
yes, sir. very good, sir. here it is right here, sir. there, sir.
just as i suspected, wise guy! i don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
will you tell the gentleman i'm not in?
mary dawson, huh? mary dawson, my eye. that dame took you for a sleigh ride that new york will laugh about for years. she's the slickest, two- timing, double-crossing—
she's the star reporter on the mail. every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. she's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "cinderella man." you've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
shut up!
this is for you , mac. the names of all the headwaiters in town. you can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
aw, listen babe, i can't let you quit now. you're not going through with this thing, are you?
it's for you. in a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing.
hello . . .
hello, mary?
oh, hello darling.
pack my things, walter. i'm going home.
yes, sir.
you shouldn't be running away like this. what's going to happen to the estate?
they can have the estate.
you can't come up here!
let me go! i wanna see him!
he's not home, i tell you!
i wanna see that guy!
we'll send for the police!
let me go!
let him alone.
let me alone!  if you know what's good for you - you'll let me get this off my chest!  how did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  get a kick out of it, huh? got a big laugh?  did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! no!
shall i call the police, sir?
no!  what do you want!!
yeah - that's all that's worrying you. what do i want?  a chance to feed a wife and kids! i'm a farmer. a job! that's what i want!
a farmer, eh! you're a moocher, that's what you are! i wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! you're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
sure - everybody's a moocher to you. a mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you!
are you married?
yes, sir.
any children?
no, no children.
all right, mr. dodsworth. i think you'll qualify.  take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
thank you very much.
next, please.
here's the order for the plows. we got a good price on them.
that's fine. thanks. i'll look 'em over later.
oh, mr. deeds—
—my wife wanted me to tell you she—  —she prays for you every night.
well, thanks, i - uh—  how do you do? what is your name?
charlie, we're off! papers all set?
all set.
okay, then. go to it.  and, charlie—
yeah?
find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
okay.
what is your name?
christian svenson.
farmer?
yes, ma'am.
where is your farm?
south dakota north.
south dakota - north?
south dakota - but on the top.
oh. oh!
what about your knocking off for lunch?
not hungry. i want to get through this work in a hurry, and then i want to go home. what price did you get on those trucks?
come on, come on. what are you trying to do, kid? keel over? you haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
well, maybe i will have a sandwich.  do you mind waiting a few minutes?
cobb! get lunch for the rest of them.
what? there must be 2000 of them out there.
well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
okay, santa claus. 2000 lunches.
miss bennett please!
this is outrageous!
it's obviously a frameup! they're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
your honor!
thank you, your honor. are you employed by the morning mail?
no!
you are under oath, miss bennett. i ask you again - are you employed by the morning mail?
no! i resigned last week!
were you given an assignment to follow the activities of longfellow deeds?
yes.
did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
yes!
are these the articles?
yes!
were you present when all these things took place?
yes!
are they true!
no!!
but they did take place?
they're colored! just to make him look silly!
and you saw them happen?
yes, but i—
that's all, miss bennett.
it isn't all! i'd like to explain—
that's all, miss bennett. that's all.
the falkner sisters are rather timid, your honor, and wish to be together. if the court pleases, i will only have one of them testify.
yes! yes! let's get on with it.
since he was born.
yes. elsie taggart was the midwife.
he was a seven-months baby.
most every day.
sometimes twice.
must we have the echo?
suppose you just answer, miss jane. now, will you tell the court what everybody at home thinks of longfellow deeds?
they think he's pixilated.
oh yes, pixilated.
he's what?
what was that you said he was?
pixilated.
uh-huh.
he walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
sometimes he whistles.
and sings.
for no reason, i guess. he always does it. we always run into the house when we see him coming.
never can tell what he's going to do.
he sure is pixilated.
oh, yes - he's pixilated all right.
you remember, dr. fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples.
uh-huh.
especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
oh, yes. yes, of course dr. von holler. very interesting.
it reminds me very much of this one. nicht wahr?
ja.
it takes so long to detect them—  —because their mood changes so often and so quickly. now, your honor, may i show you? may i use the chart?
oh, thank you!
your honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. i object.
your honor, this is absurd. the woman's obviously in love with him.
what's that got to do with it?
well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
what's that got to do with it?
you are , aren't you?
yes!!!
your honor—
yes?
i'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
take the stand!
proceed.
well, i don't know where to begin. there's been so many things said about me that i—
a what?
an o-filler. you fill in all the spaces in the o's, with your pencil.  i was watching you.
mr. deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
oh, yes. yes. about my throwing those people out of my house. mrs. pomponi told the truth. i did throw them out because i didn't want the party in the first place. i didn't invite anybody. mrs. pomponi did all that. they just came to see what kind of a freak the "cinderella man" was. i don't know how people like that are supposed to act, your honor, but if that pomponi woman is an example, i'll stick to simple folks. she just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. if i were a friend of hers, i'd have her examined.
your honor, i object.
proceed.
now about the falkner sisters. that's kind of funny. i mean about mr. cedar going all the way to mandrake falls to bring them here. do you mind if i talk to them?
not at all.
why, you own it, longfellow.
yes, you own it.
why, you've always been pixilated, longfellow.
always.
why, everybody in mandrake falls in pixilated - except us.
uh-huh.
oh, yes.
yes, indeedy.
mr. deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. this rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. it is, to say the least, most uncommon.
oh yes, i was getting to that, your honor.
please, mr. cedar!  proceed.
personally, i don't know what mr. cedar's raving about. from what i can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
it's a lie!
mr. cedar!
mr. deeds is drawing on his warped imagination!
you will please permit mr. deeds to finish.
but your honor—
mr. cedar!
anything else, mr. deeds?
no.  yes. there's just one more thing i'd like to get off my chest before i finish.
proceed.
thank you, your honor.
he's still pixilated.
he sure is.
