who we got here...?
john levy, staff, and amy cain, press off....
alright.  look here, any of you kids hear in this room:  what you hear here, what you say here, what you <u>do</u> here, f'it got out, you leaked it.  tell'em what they need to know.
when it broke, he said one word:  get me ronnie brean.
well.  alright.  what is it?  what's, he, uh...?  he had an illegal immigrant, was his gardener, some years back...?  what's the thing?  you people get ahead, you sure get nervous.
it can be documented that he displayed the...
this ain't the illegal immigrant nanny.
there was a group of girlscouts here from indiana last month.  one of them expressed an interest in a frederick remington bust.  the president took her into the oval office, for a period...
three minutes.  it couldn't have been over three minutes, the secret service...
okay.  and she's alleging...?
we are virtually certain it isn't...
who's got the story?
don't you want to know if it's true?
what difference does it make if it's true?  it's a <u>story</u>, and, it <u>breaks</u> they're gonna have to <u>run</u> with it -- how long've we got til it breaks?
front page.  washington post.  tomorrow.
well, yeah.  now.  that's not good.  <u>okay</u>:  <u>okay</u>.  we'll set up the war room <u>here</u>...
china.
when's he coming back...?
touchdown, andrews, fourteen hundred, today.
alright, now, here:  he stays on the ground in china til tomorrow.
...why?
...you the press office?
...yes.

...good...
when do we bring'em back?
you gotta give me a day.  i need a day.  he's sick, get it out <u>now</u>.  get him on the phone'n tell him how sick he is.  we got to get it out before the story breaks, so we aren't quote, responding to it. issue is as a bulletin.  he's got some rare strain of...
it won't hold.
all i need is the one day.
it won't even hold the one day, ronnie --
yes -- it will... now:  why is the president in china?
trade re1ations.
you're goddamn right.  and it's got nothing to do with the b-2 bomber.
there <u>is</u> no b-2 bomber,
that's what i'm telling you.  the two things:  the two things:  rare strain of flu, no cause to be alarmed.  and the b-2 bomber...  clear me a space.  get me a copy, go rob one, get it off the computer, wash post, n.y. <u>times</u>,
you want some research, flu?  side-effects of medi....
naw, we can't play this one catch-up.  that's how long since you stopped beating the wife.  we have to...
we're going to have to explain away the...
they caught him in the closet with a girlscout.  side- effects of a pill ain't gone trump that.  you have to keep'em guessing for  two weeks.  you  don't have to cure cancer, pal, you just have to give them something more interesting than...
what's more interesting than boffing the girlscout?
well, that's what we're <u>doing</u> here...
car and a driver, mr. brean, the westgate, now, please...
okay, look, who's takin' the press conference today?
is there a press conference today?
what do <u>you</u> think?  what i need from you:  i need a base of operations.  some place in the district.  i need some clean <u>money</u> ...
how much...?
and, to hold it together, i need two days.  there <u>is</u> no b-2 bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the post, lets it slip, "geez, i hope this doesn't screw up the b-2 program..." "what b-2 program, and why should it screw it up?"  "if the president moves to deploy the b-2 before it is fully tested."  "deploy the b-2, <u>why</u>?"  "in the crisis."
what crisis?
i'm working on it.  same time, you call billy scott at joint chiefs, and pour him onna plane <u>right now</u> to seattle, y'got that...?  all flustered and worried. to talk to the <u>boeing</u> people.
<u>do</u> it...
and you?
but there isn't a b-2 bomber.
where'd you go to school, kid.  wellesly?
dartmouth
then show a little spunk.  there <u>is</u> no b-2 bomber, general scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in seattle to talk with boeing...
it won't hold.
one day, two days?  <u>course</u> it's gonna hhhh....
it won't hold, ronnie, it won't prove out.
we don't need it to prove out.  we need it to <u>distract</u> them for two weeks til the election.
what would do that...?
what in the <u>world</u> would do that?
i'm working on it.
gimme twenty thousand dollars.
i'll be back within the hour.  now,
it's going to be fine.  it's going to be ... you remember in 88, when...
what is it?
it's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.
twenty thousand dollars.
yeah, i'm gonna have to go to l.a.
gemme a plane.  business aviation, national, one hour. fly to chicago.  o'hare, lax 6 a.m.
i'll see you at national.
tell, tell, tell me again.
....we landing?
tell me again.
lookit, don't worry about it.  it's not a new concept. wake me when we touch down, will...
we can't <u>afford</u> a war.
we aren't going to have a war.  we're going to have the "appearance" of a war.
i'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
what's it gonna cost?
but, but, but, "they" would find out.
who would find out?
...the...
the american "people"?
yes
who's gonna tell'em.
...but...
what did they find out about the gulf war?  one shot: one bomb, falling though the roof, building coulda been made of <u>legos</u>.
...you want us to go to war...
...that's the general idea.
why?
why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  also:  they sound... ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the b-2 <u>bomber</u>...
...they sound what?
<u>shifty</u>.  who knows anything <u>about</u> em...
hold on, hold on, hold on:
well, i'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  you wanna change this subject, you better have a war.  what do you need?  it's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  okay?  what do you need in an enemy?  somebody you fear.  who do you fear? som'b'y you don't know.
<u>who</u>?
well, i'm <u>working</u> on it....
yes.
why?
what do you know about them?
...<u>nothing</u>...
precisely.
what did albania ever do to us?
what did they ever do <u>for</u> us...?  you see, this is why we have to mobilize the b-2 bomber.
...you want us to go to war with albania.
here's what you got to do:  get your press office, right now.  to deny;  there <u>is</u> no report of albanian activity.  they have to deny it. now, get the c.i.a.
do i know you?
we have some mutual friends in washington.
waal, mr. moss, i wouldn't....
you wouldn't be here if it wasn't true.  it's true, right?
and you're here <u>why</u>...?
i'm here, mr. moss, because you've shown yourself a great supporter of the party.
party's gonna need more than a couple bucks now.
what one has to do, mr. moss.  is to fight a holding action.
...holding action.  they're going to tear this guy to <u>shreds</u>.
if we can hold the break-in-the-dam for ten days, til the election, we...
yeah, hut you can't hold the dam.  how the hell, n'nu'n', i don't get what you want <u>me</u> to ...
what do you want the kid to say?
have him say, 'i know we're all concerned for the president, there will he an update at 5:45.'
string a few together.  all i need's eleven,
how you going to stretch it?  this won't hold for eleven days.  guy fucked a twelve- year-old...whadday're gonna do to hold that off?
what do you think would hold it off?
uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>war</u>, uh...  you're kidding.
i'm a jew in show business.  why come to me?
i'm gonna <u>tell</u> you why...
here's the short course:  fifty-four, forty or fight. what does <u>that</u> mean?
uh, it's a slogan.  from, uh...
remember the maine...
that's from the ... it's got to be from the...
tippecanoe and tyler, too!
...uh ... no, that's...
we remember the slogans, we can't even remember the fucking <u>wars</u>.  y'know why.  cause it's <u>show business</u>. that's why i'm here.  naked girl, covered in napalm. five marines raising the flag, mount suribachi. churchill, v for victory, y'remember the picture, fifty years from now, they'll have forgotten  the war.  gulf war?  smart bomb, falling through the roof.  2500 missions a day, 100 days, <u>one shot</u> of one bomb.  the american people bought that war. m'i getting through to you?  war in the balkans, don't mean nothing, till some g.i. flyer, went down, eating snakes for ten days. n'then it's show business, mister moss.  that's why i'm here.
it's like being a producer, mr. moss.  the things in trouble.  somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  you get the actors get up there, and strut and <u>posture</u>.  but somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and save the thing.
why albania?
why not?
who?
the...
"they got to know?"  <u>stan</u>...?  get with it.  who killed kennedy...?  i read the first draft of the warren report, said he was killed by a drunk <u>driver</u>.  you watched the gulf war.  what did you see?  day after day, the one "smart bomb" falling into a building. the <u>truth</u>, i was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, falls church virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
is that true?
how the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  you take my point?
...going to war...
it's not "war."  it is a <u>pageant</u>.  it's a <u>pageant</u>... like the oscars... why we came to <u>you</u>...
i never won an oscar.
n'it's a crying shame.  but you <u>staged</u> the oscars...
yes.  indeed i did.
you know, you're a <u>writer</u>, that's your script.  you're a <u>director</u>...  but if you're the <u>producer</u> ... what did you do?  what did you do?  all you've got is the <u>credit</u>...  some plaque on the wall...
and <u>if</u> you never won an oscar, how'd you like an ambassadorship...
hell, i'd just do it for the <u>hell</u> of having <u>done</u> it, for a story to tell...
well, no, well, you couldn't <u>tell</u> any...
hey, i know that, hey, i'm <u>kidding</u>...  "it's a pageant"
...that's what it is.
"the country is at war."
it's miss america, n'you're bert parks.
...yoha, yoha... yoha.  <i>why</i> albania?
because.
they got to have something that we want.
i'm sure they do.
what do we have that they want?
"freedom."
why would they want that?
alright, well, alright:  geopolitically...
we've just found out they have the bomb.  we've just found out they have the <u>bomb</u>, aaaand... no, no wait a second, no, no, wait a second, no.  the bomb's not... it's not <u>there</u> -- because they'd have to have a rocket and that shit n'they're a buncha wogs-- it's ... it's a <u>suitcase</u> bomb.  ooookay.  it's a <u>suitcase</u> bomb, and it's .... in canada!  eh?  albanian terrorists have placed a suitcase bomb in canada, in an attempt to infiltrate the bomb into the usa.
you know what?  this is good.  this is terrific, and i'll tell you why:  it's <u>cost effective</u>.  this is....
it's <u>producing</u>.
no, this is great.
i could tell you stories:  cecil b. demille:  alright? the greatest show on earth:  he needs an elephant,
i have the white house on the line.
...one minute:  demille needs an elephant for a reshoot.
ames here.  <u>yessir</u>...
okay.  okay.  the <u>suitcase</u> bomb...
...the suitcase bomb.  act one albania denies it. president comes on the air, "be calm."  okay, now: good.  now, alright.  act <u>two</u>...  i need the following here.  right now:  johnnie green, liz butsky, and get me the fad king.
isn't johnny green in the...
no, he's back in nashville.
...who is this guy...?
act two:  and then, act two...
we don't need an act two.
and get me the fad king.  no.  get him first...  we don't need an act two?
we've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the election.
...it's a teaser!
it's a teaser, absolutely right,
the <u>thinking</u> is, as of this moment, <u>terrorism</u>...  ...they're getting a good reaction on the "albania" thing...
hello, <u>king</u>.  how the heck <u>are</u> you...?  <u>get</u> out...  <u>get</u> out... well, man, you fall in love like a <u>hillbilly</u>...  ditch the wife, toss the kids in the pick-up,   listen, king:  <u>get</u> your fat redneck ass out here, <u>willya</u>...
...but the president wonders about the possible albanian backlash...
you can't have a war without an enemy.
no, king, i need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  how long do i need him for?
well, you could <u>have</u> one, but it'd be a very ineffective war...  we're <u>done</u> in 10 days...
ten days.  there going to be any back end in this thing?
w...what?
...there gonna be any money in this thing?
"back end" ... count on it.
lots n lotsa cash.  stay on for gracie, she'll get you a ticket
...where is the back end coming from?
it's like that thing with the yellow ribbon...
the thing with the yellow ribbon...
the hostages...?
the hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring...  it was a put-up job?  but where was the, where was the money in that?
in the yellow ribbon.
...the yellow ribbon, but who, who'd profit from <u>that</u>...
the ribbon manufacturers.
king, king, i got a thing here, a product placement, gonna have a bigger back-end than hattie mcdaniel. now:
i gotta protect the canadian horder,
why can't it be a ribbon?
it can't be a ribbon cause aids had a ribbon, cause the yellow ribbon thing had a ribbon, cause...
look, look, look, look, canada, okay...?  our neighbor to the north, alla sudden, transformed, into that place, where, like the north wind, <u>terror</u> comes...
keep talking....
what guards us against canada...?
uh...uh... mounties.  the mounties guard the border. uh... those mountie hats.
they look stupid.
we had davy crockett hats... they made a fortune.
we had davy crockett hats, but you could <u>crush</u>'em ... you could <u>crush</u>'em, see, when you felt stupid. crush'em, put em in your pocket.  you can't put a mountie hat in your...
y'see, <u>this</u> is what producing is:  you put me in a <u>room</u>...
...and he's got a <u>negative</u> rating of...
king, we've got to be on the streets in...
...what am i <u>doing</u>?  do you see me working...?  here's what you want to do, you want to come out of the box, an item, someone 'ready <u>has</u>, but <u>then</u> you sell it to'em.  torn <u>jeans</u>, uh ... faded levi jackets, uh... uh...
where are we on the image?  grace?  <u>grace</u>...
over a sleeping brean, stretched out on a poolchair, grace, the secretary, comes out on to the pool area, holding the shot of a small, foreign looking child, in front of a pile of rubble. she shows it to moss.
...we own it?
public domain.
and what?  what?  she was driven from her home, by albanian terrorists.  it is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?
we-are-mobilizing-to-defend-<u>her</u>.
can we give'er a <u>kitten</u>?
no problem.  here's the...
i gotta get something, i gotta get ...shoes?  ties? hats...?  good.  good.

and one of them is in love with the <u>sister</u> of...

ny times, washington post, war, war, war.  times got the girlscout page twelve, post in section two.... horses in mid-stream...?
i don't think you're gonna need it.
well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
they got the guys on a <u>retainer</u>, it's cheaper, <u>pay</u>'em, but don't lettem touch it... let'em leave us alone.
what can it hurt.
what can it hurt is they offend me.
i need a ruling on the hats.  i say a leopard-skin, and...
hey, <u>you're</u> getting the big bucks....  i think we're up-and-running...

better.
you like it?
yes.
fine.  good.
would somebody wake me in five minutes?
does it <u>have</u> to be albania?  because, lookit:  i can get my hands on a lot of walking-around-cash, i think, if it's <u>italy</u>...look at the tie-in here:  <u>the</u> <u>boot</u>, "givvem the <u>boot</u>,"... if we were to go wide with a <u>shoe</u> as the fad.  a "shoe-fad"...  here's what it offers us...
we're locked into albania.
well, let's not be too sure, why is that?
the president is going to declare war against albania in a half an hour.
okay.  here's what we're gonna do.
i need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?

stanley moss, ladeesngennlmen... and she says...
is she saying this in albanian...?
<u>yes</u>:  she is saying this in albanian, <u>but</u> she's doing it not to be uh...  but because, she explains, that is the only way it can be understood by her aged and sainted mother, who is standing there with her, dressed in her traditional...
our adopted land...
...but to the old world; you are stilling the forces of hatred and of war which have, since i was a child...
...uh huh...

<u>so</u> forth...

speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow moss want?
<u>i</u> dunno.... ambassador to <u>togo</u>, somethin', <u>i</u> dunno... he...
maybe he's just a <u>patriot</u>.
yeah...what was i talking about...?
how long you been up, you need a nap.
due in nashville.
<u>nashville</u>...?
we're gonna do the <u>team song</u>.
you're tired, ronnie.
y'wanna follow the cattle drive?  sleep in the winter. what does <u>moss</u> want...?  matchmaker comes to the levinsky family.  mr. levinsky, mrs. levinsky, would you entertain an offer of marriage for your son saul, from princess margaret of great britain.  well, they think, she isn't jewish, but she's well to-do, a nice old family.  alright, yes, they say.  we would consider such an offer.  wonderful, matchmaker says, my job is half done.  now, look:  i got the <u>file</u>, from the l.a. contingent, i got the day-by-day, of how...
...this is magnificent.
...stanley moss...
8 days and we bring it back home....
none of these are ours.  <u>none</u> of em are ours....  ....that's <u>real politik</u>, buddy.
waal, i gotta tell you.  i've been inside the beltway fourteen years, and i feel like i just got my feet wet.
...i just missed my plane.
you missed your <u>plane</u>?  my <u>life</u> is over.  my <u>life</u> is over.  what have you <u>done</u> to me?  what have i done?  fourteen years of public service...
well, keep your <u>wits</u> about you, and let's see if we can't...
...fourteen years...
...brazen-it-through...
brazen it through?  brazen it <u>through</u>?  they're going to hang us out to dry like the <u>laundry</u> --- do you know what we've <u>ddd</u>...
oh, migod.
guess who <u>i</u> am.
i'd like to mention a few <u>names</u>, who...
i know who you are, mr. ames.
i was acting as a private citizen.  nothing that i've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe i am connected with.  or in whose <u>employ</u>...
quite touching.
and i take this <u>opportunity</u> to suggest that, equally, i admit to <u>nothing</u>, and that i would like my lawyer present.
guess what?  we show, and n.s.a. confirms, there <u>are</u> no nuclear devices on the canadian border.  there are no nuclear devices in albania.  z'at put us in something of a pickle?  albania <u>has</u> no nuclear capacity.  our spy satellites show "no secret terrorist camps" in the albanian hinterland.  the f.b.i. and the border patrol, and the r.c.m.p. report no repeat no untoward activity along our picturesque canadian border.  the albanian government is screaming its innocence, the world is listening.  there is no war.
course there's a war.  i'm watching it on television.
n'who might <u>you</u> be, when all's said and done?
my name is ronald brean.
who're you working for?
nobody whose name you want me to say, mr. young, i promise you.
s'all very well, but when the fit hits the shan, somebody's going to have to stay after school, and who do you 'spose that might be.
s'only got to hold for another few days.
well, i'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
what <u>are</u> you interested in?
i'm interested in the security of my country, mr. brean.
as are we all, and i'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
and i think that the security of the country would be best-served by its citizens obeying its laws.  gemme a federal judge, gemme search-warrants, all premises controlled by our friends, and bench-warrants for the two of...
well, i'm sure that speaks very well of you and for your parents.  but if forced to choose between the security of the country and the security of your job, which would you pick.  and, while you hesitate, permit me to suggest that they are one and the same.  your country and your job.
i'm <u>doing</u> my job, mr. brean.  that's what you see me doing here.  what <u>is</u> it you thought <u>you</u> were doing?
and i'd like to point out that i've been on prescription <u>medication</u>, the side-effects of which...
i'm doing my job, too.  would you give me a... do you think you could call off your dogs for a minute.
what's on your mind?
i have a question for you.
ask it.
why do people go to war?
why do people go to war?
i'll play your silly game.
why do they go to war?
to preserve their way of life.
would you go to war to do that?
i have.
well, i have, too.  would you do it <u>again</u>...?  in't that why you're here?  i guess <u>so</u>.  n'if you go to war again, who is it going to be against?  your "ability to fight a two-ocean war" against who?  sweden and <u>togo</u>? who you sitting here to go to war against?  that time has <u>passed</u>.  it's <u>passed</u>.  it's <u>over</u>.  the war of the future is <u>nuclear terrorism</u>.  it is and it will be against a small group of dissidents who, unbeknownst, perhaps, to their own <u>governments</u>, have blah blah blah. and to go to <u>that</u> war, you've got to be <u>prepared</u>.  you have to be alert, and the <u>public</u> has to be alert. cause that is the war of the <u>future</u>, and if you're not gearing up, to fight <u>that</u> war, <u>eventually</u> the axe will fall.  n'you're gonna be out in the street.  and you can call this a "drill," or you can call it "job security," or you can call it anything you like. but i got one for you:  you said, "go to war to protect your way of life,"  well, chuck, <u>this</u>  is your way of life.  innit?  and if there ain't no war, you can punch out, go home, and take up oil painting.  and there <u>ain't</u> no war but ours.
no.  i was busy.  yes, i need the new poll fig.... <u>how</u> long?  i'll call in from nashville.  and patch me through to the big bird, will...?  i've got to <u>hand</u> it to you.  <u>they</u> sure let us out of there easy....
...they just hadn't thought it through...
we got the guy, we got the guy, we got the guy!

the threat of nuc1ear terrorism has been quelled.  we are in <u>contaot</u> with the albanian premier, who assures me, and this government <u>credits</u> his assurances, that his country does not wish us ill, and <u>has</u> not.  that the threat which we perceived was not of his wish, or of his making.
cain, mouthing along, with the speech, she looks down, and we see written, on her copy. of his making
as we look up, we see the president biting his lip, and continuing with the speech.
from whence did it come?  our information states it came from a small group of armed, dissidents.  of armed and violent dissidents...
on cain, as she looks around.
but that group has been, in the main, subdued.  now: how did we come by this information?  and.  who subdued that group?
cain looks down at her script.  shrugs, and looks up.
on the presscorp, the reporters, listening widemouthed, to the president's speech.
it falls to me to <u>reveal</u> to you a <u>secret</u>.  to reveal the existence of a secret group of warriors. men, yes, and <u>women</u>, trained and pledged their <u>strength</u>, their <u>skills</u>, and, if called upon, their <u>lives</u>, in the service of their fellow americans. a group so secret, its very existence has been known to just a few, and known not by a name, but by a designation number, three-oh-three...
...member of the group, was left behind what were, then, enemy lines.
on liz, as she walks through the h.q., on a board we see "days till election 6" and % in favor 82%.  a huge tv shows the president.
and i can only say, to those family members, <u>of</u> group 303, which members are, i know, as i speak, gathering to comfort you, the parents of the missing man, i can only say,
not bad for government work.  having a good time.
haven't had so much fun since live tv.
the president, holding the photograph
dashes and dots.  and those dots spell out a message in the morse code. and that message is, "courage, mom..."  and he got the message through. "courage.  mom..."  well, to the family of william a. schumann, to the men and women of unit 303, to my fellow citizens <u>i</u> say "courage."  i have informed the albanian government, and i inform <u>you</u>, that we will not rest until the safe return of sergeant schwn&nn.  i'm told his unit mates gave him the nickname, "old shoe."  ladies and gentleman, we will not <u>treat</u> him like an old shoe, we...
young person's apartment, night.
...we will <u>not</u> be swayed, will, will not be <u>swayed</u> from <u>every</u> effort to find <u>our</u> old shoe, our...
mmm...
you do your job right, nobody should notice.
mmm.
s'only when you fuck up, everything gets full of shit.  do you think we could line him up for the peace prize?
hey, our job ends at the finish line.
yes, but i, well, <u>you</u> know...
just for the symmetry of the thing...?
...that's right.
if they can give kissenger the peace prize, i wouldn't be surprised to wake up and find i'd won the preakness.
well, yes, but the guy <u>did</u> bring peace.
yes, but there wasn't a war.
all the greater accomplishment.
what about it?
for schumann.
well, well, well, well, wait a minute, we got 86 percent.  we bring'em back <u>tomorrow</u>, the charts go up, they don't go <u>down</u>...
all part of the service we render.
he ain't seen <u>nothin'</u> yet.
when do you bring'em back?  schumann.
schumann. we're gonna go pick him up tonight.
where is he?
out in oklahoma.
going to make a little stop back home, pick up my shirts, show him a little treat.
see y'at the finish line.
tell'em to fly the inaugural speech past me.
inaugural speech, press corp's gonna be jealous of giving up that one...
hey, lemme close out the thing in style.
i've come to feel it's my thing.  you know, you take a job... you take a job, and, many times, it's <u>just</u> a job.  and then...
hell of a ride, stanley...
...<u>isn't</u> it?  hey, what-the-hey ... it's all part of the bittersweet...
pride of a job-well-done...
it's the pride of a job well done, stanley, yes, but it's <u>more</u> than that.
...mmm?
it's the gratitude of your <u>party</u>, and of your <u>president</u>...
izzat the thing...
indeed it is.
against...who could be aggressor....help me out here...units of 303, the defense department confirms, early this morning, albanian time, stormed a mountain hideaway, near the city of -- help me out here -- and freed a tired, but happy william schumann, suffering no casualties.  his condition is reported as guarded, and his route to the us has not been disclosed, but a high white house source confirms he is expected in washington tomorrow morning...no, that's for the wire service.  moss's working on big bird's inaugural.  nine a.m...?  nine?  miss the commuters, but...
...we'll gettim in their cars.
yeah, we'll gettem in their cars.  i'm slowing down...  no, no.  look, lookit:  i think it's a mistake, well, i'll <u>tell</u> you why:  you got'em by the balls, <u>squeeze</u>.  because schumann's the shark.  he's ...<u>jaws</u>.  you have to <u>tease</u>'em... you don't puttem in the first reel of the movie...  bring'em back <u>slow</u>, the president...  no, no, put him on.  put him on.  president wants to reveal scbumann before the election.
big mistake.
hell, yes, we're, we're on our way to get him now.  no. lookit:  it's like a girl with her virginity, y'understand...
guy says he'll respect her tomorrow, he <u>might</u>, but why take a chance?  hold out til after you're married. that's... that's.... looky, we're offering'em schumann, make em <u>vote</u> for hhhh.... psychologically, they will understand that that's the bargain.  make them pay for him.  make... that's right, the price is their vote. now, we bring him home, the president announces he is flying <u>home</u>, he's <u>here</u>, he's <u>there</u>... f'there the election, ta da, here he is.  have him say it like i wrote it, it'll be fine. thanks.  labor, five bucks an hour.  if you <u>watch</u>, <u>ten</u> bucks an hour.  if you <u>help</u> ... if you <u>help</u>, a <u>hundred</u> bucks an hour.
hey, lcokit:  <u>any</u> business...

what am <u>i</u> gonna do?  i'm gonna "fade away."  what are you gonna do?
well, i'll be damned if i <u>know</u> ... you know... doing this <u>thing</u> ...  you know what the worst word is, in the english language?  it's ïretirement."  what the <u>hell</u> was i thinking of?  hell, i used to...
we pick up schumann.  sneak him back inside the beltway. and we plan his homecoming.  zt's gone be neil armstrong, dr. livingston, and <u>lindy</u>...they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget, they're gonna forget that there <u>is</u> an election...the pres's gonna have to say, one of his speeches, "don't forget to vote..."
i got it in the inaugural.  "thank you for voting for me, but, <u>as</u> importantly:  thank you for <u>voting</u>...
getting off on the inaugural?  gonna go...

but, you know, <u>this</u> is the meeting, ron?  you think about it.  <u>this</u> is the meeting.  this, here.  schumann and us.  king kong and the trainers...this's it... what are you working on?
on brean, who is doodling.
medal.  medal and ribbon.
of what?
the albanian campaign.
...the albanian campaign.  this... this is history...
...the albanian campaign...
...like the <u>sound</u> of it, eh...
we've got to put that, into the inaugural.  "i have here, a ribbon.  you haven't seen it before, and you will not see it too often <u>now</u>.  for it is the proud possession of a few, a very few men and women... it is the ribbon of the albanian campaign...."
wilfred, that's not bad.
that's not bad at all.
well, you know, "the whole thing's theatre..."
napoleon said, fellow won't sell you his life, but he will trade it to you for a little piece of ribbon.
...the albanian campaign.  and we won't even be a footnote...

...a masterpiece...
...givem what they want...but...

...child at the airport...  breaks through the ranks, runs to "old shoe" -- should we have <u>flower</u> or a <u>bear</u>...?
uh...didn't we <u>do</u> this?
never quit a winner.
i thought they weren't meeting him at the airport...
they insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  i told'em they're wrong, i can't convince'em. they're concerned that the last kid had the <u>wheat</u>. variations include, the kid is a <u>boy</u>, the kid is <u>twins</u>, it's a little <u>dog</u> ... they rub meat on schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him...
uh...
i think we asked for "special programs" and they gave us "special prisons."
yeah, well -- it's only one word difference.
he, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?
...twelve years.
much more...uh, he have much more time to "serve?"
yeeaahhh...  ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...

look, look, look....  he's fine, as long as he has his medication.
what happens if he doesn't have his medication?
he's not fine.
the plane, in a violent rainstorm, bucking wildly.  ames, on his knees, gathering up the pills, replaces them in the vial, shakes out two, and gives them to schumann.  who takes them.  moss then straps himself back in and brean continues talking on the telephone.
you gonna git me back tomorrow?  cause they havin <u>beans</u> tomorrow...

he's fine, as long as he gets his medication.
speaking of that...  we're gonna need a whole lot <u>more</u> of this....
well, get on the phone, and <u>get</u> it...
you know, i think you people are looking at this all wrong.  if you look at the <u>backstory</u> -- the guy's coming back from combat and torture.  of <u>course</u> he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  of <u>course</u> he's gonna "need a little help"...
oh, lord....

eh?  i'm like the rest of america.  i don't <u>care</u> -- i'm just <u>addicted to it</u>...
the crowds at andrew's airkorce base, the "old shoe" banners, the "courage, mom," banners.  the still band.  a shot of the bandmaster, surreptitiously, glancing at his watch.
how's our friend?  what is he, "dead?"
wake up.

courage, mom.
oh.  hell.  and what do we do now?  what do we do <u>now</u>? boy producer?  mister win-an-emmy, social conscience, <u>whaleshit</u>, save- the-rainforest, liberal hire-a-convict <u>shithead</u>? mister affirmative-action peacnik.  commie... <u>shithead</u>....?
this is nothing. ...piece of cake.  y'know, producing is being a samurai warrior.  they pay you, day in, day out, for years, so that, one day, when <u>called</u> upon, you can respond, your training at its peak, and save the day.
brean, shaking his head.  in the b.g., moss, drinking. the tv comes to life.

you can't tell this story.  he's not kidding you.  you can't tell this story.  <u>you</u> knew that.  the pay off was, you get to be ambassador, or...
no, no, no...
you would be, two, if you'd gone through what he went through.
he raped a <u>nun</u>...
what he went through in <u>albania</u>...
he's doped to the <u>gills</u> ...
...where's my l'il <u>pill</u>?
show some compassion.
... and he spent the last twelve years in a milit&ry prison...
how do we explain <u>that</u>?
...how do we explain that?  hey?  am i worried...?
...how do we explain that?  with the world watching.
<u>fuck</u> the world.  try a ten a.m. <u>pitch</u> meeting, no sleep, coked-to-the-gills, and you haven't even read the <u>material</u>.
but how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
how do we explain that?  ah, well, you see, wilfred, this is where you've never been at a <u>pitch</u>.  you see? his <u>records</u> say he was in prison ... as they must, as <u>all</u> the records of group 303 have the men and the women, carried on their roster, as belonging somewhere else, the <u>secrecy</u> required of....
on brean and moss, who walk schumann across the highway. in the b.g. we see ames talking to the driver of the harvester, who is a small, hispanic man.
..."down safely," crew perished in the crash....
no, i'm on top of it...
"...unsure whether or not enemy action..."
no, i'm fine... i got it together....

on moss, as he walks the groggy schumann toward the gas station.
...how ya feeling, boy?
...mmm.

how 'bout a cold drink...?
"...where's my pill..."
the group watching television.
i'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
what rig?
...the harvester...
what about him?
well, he doesn't have his green card.  he doesn't have his greencard.
on schumann, who has cone to the back of the counter, and is emptying the cannisters.
where's my pill...?
... you want schumann saved by an illegal alien...?
well, what do you want to do about it?  what do you...
pals:  get on the <u>phone</u>... r'they flying it?

on the gas station owner, who has retreated to his counter and produces a shotgun, and starts to load it.
shoe, boy...?  you know, you were telling me you wanted beans?  remember, you were concerned about the beans...?
naa, fuck this, this is nothing.  oh, lord -- this just got <u>big</u>.  i see it -- <u>big</u> -- big for <u>you</u> and big for <u>me</u>.

you're not <u>thinking</u> right, pal...

and <u>what</u> is bigger than a triumphal homecoming...?
hell of a show.  hell of a job, stan.
...one more day.
naw, naw, we own the airways...
what would be true, then.
well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if i may rephrase, that the success of the president, in the polls...
...as of today, 89% favorable.
eighty-<u>nine</u> percent favorable, is based not on <u>events</u>...
...by you?
by the  media, by, yes, by, in this case, our organization.
well, there's a lot to be said for that.  and i'm going to show a clip.  you've seen it before, you've seen it <u>many</u> times...  but i'm going to ask you to look at it once more.  with the election one day off, and the president's standing in the polls...
you see?  what's the lesson here?  <u>never</u> give up. <u>never</u> give up.
no.  you're right.
