andrew mc-dair-mo?
that's mcdermott, but yeah.
he's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my english is better.  this way... so you're from new york eh? i love those hill street blues...
right. listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? did he eat some bad snails? slip on the bidet? what?
merde.
he says -
jesus...
how well did, er, do you know him?
not too well. he taught at the sorbonne, right? dad always calls him his "hippie brother". did some work with timothy leary i think, and - is he... is he going to die?
no. the doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. but basically he is, how you say, a legume.
legume? you mean, a vegetable?
vegetable, right. my mistake. it seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. they fled into the tunnels beneath paris, that's all we know...
what do you mean, maniacs?
well, here's what i think happened. a chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. why? perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. the psychedelic drug market is big these days. he gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws.
maybe we should go now. you must be very tired. we'll call if any new -
i can't believe this. why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
andy, it's not so easy. there are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under paris. it's a whole other city, crawling with drug addicts, lunatics, skinheads... it's no man's land.
here.
your uncle was carrying this. the keys to his apartment are in there. i talked to his assistant, madame flocquet. you'll be staying there a while?
yeah. i guess so.  did he say anything? before the coma?
just the name of this hospital, st. severin. he repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
why would he pick this one?
i don't know. there were others much closer. he was religious?
not that i know.
well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? thanks for your help.
oh fuck, you are his nephew...
yeah, that's the word. and you are?
serafine flocquet. i work for your uncle.
you? you're madame flocquet? i pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - i don't know - la femme nikita.
sure. i can follow that.
it's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
yeah. true. the cops weren't much help either. their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. make sense to you?
police. they have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
well put. so, what exactly has uncle terrence been up to lately?
salots! shitfucker!
what?
if you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. now i must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. he was security crazy.
you must not have known him very well. he's not like that.
hey, sorry if i was out of line.
you were. i have work to do. the publisher wants the transcripts by monday. go. make yourself at home.
fine. my mistake. you know, i'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
uh-huh. good for you.
medusa... what's this? some kind of club?
it's nothing. a stupid party. not really a night club, it's, uh...
like an underground club?
yes. it's a bad place. weird people. strange things go on.
and who's claude?
professor claude rousel. the one your uncle was working with. he teaches cultural history.
in an underground club? i'd like to see that.
i'm serious. there's nothing for you down there. it's dangerous.
come on. i'm from new york - the "shoot me" state. don't wait up.
what good can you do? why are you being so fucking stupid?
maybe i didn't know him like you did. but he's my uncle. and i owe it to him to get some answers. it's a quest like, uh, hemingway, the old man and the sea. except instead of an old man i'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under paris. and instead of a big fish it's... who knows? that's what i'm going to find out. au revoir.
i'm sorry my friend, i'm not signing books right now. there's been a tragedy.
i know. i'm andy mcdermott. terrence's nephew.
it's horrible. terrence was one of the most brilliant men i've known.
yeah, well, why did he hang out here? the cops said it's dangerous -
the cops. it's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.
psychic awareness. right.
you think it's silly. but do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
what?
he's on a new drug called zbh, or "daydream". it allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. he is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off?
andy...
yeah?
terrence and i came down here to do serious work. for centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate.
you didn't know? but then why did you... well, don't worry. it's relatively mild.
yeah, well if i claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? jesus... the cops were probably right. my uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
wait a second, are you like the steven king of france or something...
andy!
so you came after all. just in time, it's getting interesting.
you must get out of here. it's not safe.
not you too -
my god! serafine's right. it's time to go. we'll talk soon.
in paris we have an expression for people like you: encul d'americain.
yeah? in new york we got an expression too. goes like this...
hey! you shouldn't be down there!
for god's sakes, let me out!!
get me the fuck out of here!!
"fuck"? you think i don't know this word "fuck"? is that how you talk to policemen in america?
okay, what the hell are you up to?
it bit me! my leg! jesus, it's down there, shoot it! shoot it for christ's sakes!
there's something down there! a bear or something! a god damn monster! beau coup teeth! huge, grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed serafine! my god...
you on drugs? huh?
no... i...
well?
okay. so maybe you were right.
hmmph. at least now there's one person around here who doesn't think i'm crazy.
twelve thirty-six a.m. here. twelve forty a.m. here. there's two of them. at least.
merde.
two more nights in this lunar cycle.
double merde.
you better follow that mcdermott kid. he's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
right. little twerp thinks he's colombo.
saint severin...
you never heard the story of saint severin driving the werewolves from paris?
you think that's what mcdermott was raving about in the ambulance?
what, you think everyone's as ignorant as you?
andy! holy shit!
serafine...?
thank god! what a relief! i thought... after you disappeared... i couldn't find you... i thought all sorts of horrible things...
yeah... ditto. i saw, er, i thought i saw you get munched... like uncle terrence...
what happened? did you cut yourself?
um... sort of... maybe... it's all kind of blurry. we met at the club, then... damn, that was some weird shit.
you have to be a hero. all americans think they are cowboys.
i was an indian, actually. man, that damn psycho paint...! if that's supposed to be mild, i don't want to know about medium.  the planet earth. it's good to be back.
so... you feel okay now?
fan-fucking-tastic?
hey, what more could i want? i survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. i'd say i feel almost as great as you look.
come on serafine. let's go out. show me the real paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with german tourists.
go to jim morrison's grave at pere lachaise. it's overrun with american tourists. i have to work.
i know! let's go hock loogies off the eiffel tower!
what about food? even beautiful women have to eat. it's true. i read it. please? a half an hour?  my treat?  pleez! don't make go out there alone again! i'm begging you!
okay. but i'm back in half an hour.
what about your glasses?
it's okay. i can see fine.
don't you want to change?
man! our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! you french women work quick!
shit! you bought enough pate for a fucking army!
so tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study english with?
like i should talk. monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. i'm really sorry about that whole woody allen thing...
so's woody allen.  no, your uncle really helped me. i was sort of messed up for a while. wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. he kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  you know, he and claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. totally dedicated.
that's what counts. if you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. that's why i quit college... plus i'm a lazy bastard.  wait, i know this... a votre sante.
a la votre.
this looks familiar...
ahh, rodin. mmm! he's the fuc-  i mean, he's the best. you must go to the rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
serafine...
i'll be right back. stay put.
fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? who the fuck are you calling?
professor roussel. there's something wrong with you. i know it.
roussel? you mean claude? you're calling dr. demento so he can come paint my face again? fuck that.
andy, stop! i think he can help you -
allo?
andy!
serafine? is that you? what's going on?
claude, it's andy, he's acting really weird, i think something happened last night...
god, well don't let him go! catch him!
actually, i'm waiting for someone.
what a coincidence, i am someone!  mmm. calvin klein's obsession. now it's mine too.
god. how can you eat like that?
it's all in the tongue. another bottle?
wow. you know kung fu or something?
yeah. apparently.
ha ha. you were probably right about his mom.
hope i didn't hurt him too bad.
who gives a shit? i've had it up to here with arrogant frenchmen.
up to there? really? i bet i could beat that.
ha ha! yeah right, white boy! ha ha ha.  i think maybe i drank too much.
ah. the mating call of the blonde. the night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
i don't know... surprise me.
ahh! jesus! you're burning hot! what the hell -
ahhhhhhh!
hello?
are you okay?
no, i don't think so... i was having a nightmare. wait a second...
where did you go last night? what did you do?
i don't... i... i can't remember...
listen, i'm coming over. don't go anywhere. stay right there.
you recognize her?
what?!
we know you were with her.
oh shit... no...
that's not all...  marcel - officer boulard was following you.
oh no... no....
he was a good man. now his wife is a widow.
this is... it's like a sick joke, i -
merde... wait here. when i return you tell me about last night, huh?
but... i don't remember anything, i swear...
i leave these open. maybe something comes back to you.
thanks for the lovely evening, shithead!
aaaaa! jesus! this isn't happening. i'm still hallucinating. shit!
okay. so he's weird. maybe on drugs. still, that's not -
i'm telling you. it's not drugs. it's something more. someth -
don't give me your black magic bullshit! seven mutilations in forty eight hours and all you find is a scrawny american boy? do you have a motive?  do you have a weapon? or do you want me to believe he did it with his own two hands?
i told you. these murders are not normal.
face it boyfriend. this is really happening.
no it isn't! you're dead!
i'm afraid she's not so lucky. she's undead. and so am i.
aaaaa!!! get the fuck away from me!
what are you so damn angry about? did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out? huh?
okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
a-duh... you're a werewolf. and we, as your victims, have to walk the earth until your curse is lifted.
uh huh... and, supposing i believed that, what could i do about it?
enough. cut him loose.
i can't! at midnight tonight, he will kill again. it's crazy!
are you crazy? we have nothing. let him go, then watch him. if you're right, you can pick him up at midnight. or maybe he'll lead you to the others. just let him go.
hanging is nice. never goes out of style. what about hare-kare - a taste of the orient? but no! you're in paris! try the guillotine! there's one in the louvre!
i'd use pills. they're painless.
oh give me a break! he could use pills back in america! why not get a little culture?
look, i didn't mean to hurt anybody... god, i didn't mean to... to...
rip my face off? hey, we all make mistakes. hell, i didn't mean to sleep with you on the first night, especially without a condom. but i did, and now i'm paying the price.
let's face it. it's a, how do you say... mother-fucker. but we're all in it together. that's why we're trying to help you.
exactly.
merde! just missed!
uhh! would you die already!
fuck you! if i'm gonna kill myself i'll do it when i'm good and ready! you can go to hell!
no we can't. that's the problem. god knows it would beat hanging around with you!
hey, you can't kick me! you're an apparition!
what, all of a sudden you got a degree in supernatural law?
ha-ha!
oh, big man. you can beat up a couple of cadavers. well let me make something real clear, asshole. if you don't kill yourself, at midnight tonight you're gonna transform and murder innocent people!
alright. let me write a letter.
good man. now can i have my arms back?
geez, i feel bad for him. maybe we should've told him abou -
are you crazy!? you know that's totally impractical. besides, like the bible says...  an eye for an eye...
what the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. hemingway, van gogh... um... herve villachaise...
but this is class kid, all the way. what a way to go.
shit. i feel sick.
don't worry. in a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
look, the more you think about it, the harder it is.
just like sex with my wife.
the key is don't look down.
also like sex with my wife.
would you shut up?
tell you what, we'll jump together.
sure. we wouldn't ask you to do anything we wouldn't do. now give me your hand... that's it...
merde! i can't believe this!
you try to be a good sport, and look what happens.
where's the adm? where did your uncle put it?
man, i don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
bullshit! your uncle told you!
my uncle's in a coma you moron!
before the coma!
he didn't tell me anything. all he said was saint severin...
saint severin? the church? so you know all about the adm!  where is it! tell me! tell me or else!
or else what? you'll kill me?
no. but i'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
you'll never get the chance.
don't be an idiot! i'm not the only one. if i die, serafine dies!
bullshit! you're bluffing!
what, you think claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance?
claude...?
and you call me a moron...
the adm. let's go.
yeah, okay. just gimme a minute to freshen up.
so, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? you like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
if you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
what's the problem?
hey, i'm new here, what do you want?
do you think i'm an idiot?
sure. don't you?
i'm not alright. we both know that. the only reason i'm here now is to warn you. you're still in danger. gaston told me that claude has got the curse too. he's a werewolf.
i know. he told me.
what?! he told you? when?
you two faced bastard. i knew you were full of shit.
andy! no!
you're exactly right, andy. i enlisted both serafine and your uncle to obtain adm. and now i'm counting on your assistance too.
why the fuck would i do that?
because, andy. it's a cure.
a cure?
andy... i should never have let you go underground. i'm sorry...
i had to be a damn hemingway hero. well i'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
"simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed."  these pictures are not just myth, andy. the scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. this is the medieval version of a newspaper.
yeah, well what if it's the weekly world news...
i mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. i was gonna tell you but marcel wouldn't let me.
oh sure, it was all mean old marcel's idea. give me a break! we didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! not to mention disgusting. look...
i don't believe we've been introduced.
what?... oh, right, you can see these guys too. jesus...
great. later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. right now i kinda have to hurry before i grow a lot of hair and eat people.  say this heart thing works. what's it got to do with adm?
it's chemistry, andy. nothing more. mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. there were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. when i discovered this ancient cure i knew who to go to.
uncle terrence.
yes. i was able to decode the old texts and give terrence the specifications. it took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: adenine di-methyloxide. adm. i call it adam. but just before he was attacked, he hid it...
because gaston was after it.
yes, that sociopath. he's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. to him, adam is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. to us, it's salvation.
yeah, well i don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. otherwise it's -
yeah, i know. back to the eiffel tower.  and what about you?
eight o'clock. shit. you'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
that's what serafine is searching for. without much luck, i'm afraid. if only we could speak with him. but alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
what makes you so sure this will work?
i told you. he already tried to contact me once. if you saw his face... he was desperate to tell me something. i owe him this.
i don't know...
listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. he's a mcdermott. i know what his choice would be.
i suppose you're right. but i still don't like it.
they're coming!
shit. what have i done?  stall them! i'll meet you out back.
uncle terrence?
andy? andy is that you?
yeah. look, uncle terrence -
andy, i have to tell you about the dream i had - or that i'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. but it is hyper-real. i'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... i'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. shit. i'm, uh, dead, aren't i?
sort of...
undead. right. sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. what a pisser. tell you one thing though, timothy leary will be jealous as hell.
great, but listen, i need to know where you hid the adm?
the adm! be careful, andy. it's very powerful. how do you know about it?
i went to st. severin church.  now look -
oh shit! no! andy, don't let them take me back there!
the adm! quickly! where is it?!
where is it! please!
ahhh!! the wine cellar!! in a bottle of chateau margaux. a metal cylinder... don't... don't - aaaah!
i saw him. just before those bastards zapped him back. the adm is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of chateau margaux.
i didn't know he had a wine cellar.
guess that's why he hid it there. let's go.
are you crazy!?
before hemingway, there was starsky and hutch.
pull over! now!
shit!
another step and he's dead!
go ahead serafine. blow him away.
you bastard! god! i should've known. you wanted the cure all for yourself!
cure!? ha-ha-ha!
no, it's no cure. it's something much more interesting.
you fucking liar!
oh, did i hurt the little girl's feelings? well excusez moi... i confess my desire for adm is quite "intense". so i deceived you and our poor friend terry - a competent technician, but let's face it, a bit naive. "the great cure for lycanthropy!" hmph. he didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of adam, until it was too late. and even then, he came rushing down to tell me, as if i would be just as shocked! ha.
what the fuck!? you too!?
i... i didn't think you would... i'm sorry... i believed that son-of-a- bitch...
ha. some wonder drug...
why isn't it doing anything!?
nothing's happening!
looks like he lied to you too.
i hope they fucking fry us all.
yeah. french fries...
it killed him... you coulda just used draino. it's cheaper.
i told him it wasn't ready...
holy mother of god...
fuck me...
all my life i've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. well this is it. this is power!
you sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
andy?... what? what is it?  andy... are you okay?
it was you... that night in the tunnels. you. you did this to me.
no i.... andy, you can't be sure.
that's the scar where i stabbed you! oh god... you deliberately took me down there so you could... god, i can't believe it!
you made me go there. i tried to stop you! you wouldn't listen!
what was i? your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? huh?
shut up! you fucking shut up! what do you want? huh? what the hell do you want?
here! come on! do it! go ahead.
what...?
you know what. kill me. cut out my fucking heart. go on! do it!
we don't both have to die.
i couldn't do it. not to you.
we can't stop him. not now. handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. please andy...
no. we have to try. we'll figure something out. and if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. deal?  shake a paw?
i know where he'll go.
where?
somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.
didn't even have to ask.
all your weapons, on the floor! now!
no wonder he let her go.
really.
god. i can't believe it.
what?
it's making me hungry.
what does it say?
"stop! beyond this passage lie the catacombs of paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
whoa...
after the revolution, the paris cemeteries overflowed. they dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. seven million people. mostly very poor.
pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
well, they are french.
right.
these tunnels must loop around and connect.
let's go from both ends. we'll cut him off.
okay. be careful.
you too.
what've you got?
just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. i wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
what did she say?
something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under place denfert.
i need two tactical assault squads at place denfert immediately. you can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
but inspector, this girl, i wouldn't call her reliable.
now!
yes sir.
uncle terrence, you're...
yeah, i finally "checked out", thank god. but there's a bit of unfinished business.
claude.
i never thought i'd ask this of anyone, andy, but do me a favor and kill the evil son-of-a-bitch, will you?
oh god. shit...
andy...
either way works for us...
but you better hurry.
it's you. you should be dead in that wreck with bazin and racine!
shhh! be quiet, man! we're not alone -
shut up! save your stories. the only thing i want to hear is you begging for your life. i want to see you suffer, like they did.  haha! you're scared now, eh? come on. where's the scary monster now huh? ha ha... we'll see who -
i always wanted to do that. i saw it in a movie.
what about me?
my men think you died and floated away in the seine. if i wanted to, i could let them believe that.  but that would be illegal...
