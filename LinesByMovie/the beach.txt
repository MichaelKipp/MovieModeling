bonsoir.
eh - bonsoir.
excuse me.
yes?
i'm daffy.
richard. hi.
look, i'm sorry to bother you but i was wondering if you could help me out.
help you out?
yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
i'm sorry, i don't think so.
i'm waiting on some money coming through. it's just that at the moment, you know, i'm short. they're going to chuck me out. on the street in bangkok, that's bad.
i'm really sorry but i just arrived; i'm on a pretty tight budget myself. i just can't afford it.
just five dollars, please.
i'll share something with you.
i'm sorry. i can't lend you any money.
if you could see your way to lending me some cash -
here.
thank you, sir. thank you. i promise i will repay you.
just take it, ok.
you. you're the guy that lent me the money.
yeah, that's right. now could you be quiet so i can get some sleep.
ten dollars. i'll find a way to pay you back. how would you like to know about somewhere special? the perfect beach. paradise. no one else knows about it. that's got to be worth something. what do you say?
look i don't care about the money right now: i just want some sleep. so if you could be quiet -
yea, ok. i will be, i will be, i promise.
thanks.
bonjour.
good morning.
did you sleep well?
not too bad.
i hope our noise did not keep you awake.
the noise? don't worry. you're on holiday.
she means your neighbor. the scotsman
oh, that noise! yes, he certainly did.
we moved rooms because of him.
he tried to borrow money from us.
what idiot would lend him money? it would disappear.
he said if we lent him money h would tell us about a secret beach.
it's on an island that no one get to.
but he has been there, off course.
it was ridiculous; all this at three o'clock in the morning.
it would be nice though, if there was a place like that. you know, that no one could get to.
of course, but look; all these people. if that place existed, they'd all be there.
what are you doing in thailand? tourist?
traveler.
you go to patpong? see smoke from pussy, ping pong ball from pussy, razor blade from pussy; bird from pussy.
i don't think so.
why not? thai girls best in the world. thai food best in the world. thai dope best in the world.
i wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
hi.
hi there. here, take a look.
it's arranged. tomorrow morning. eight hundred bath.
nice work.
there is one problem.
he will not take us to the island. it's in the national park and it is forbidden to go there. but we are allowed to travel to this one to stay for one night.
that's the wrong one.
so from there to there?
we swim.
swim?
we leave our rucksacks on this island and then we swim.
you can swim?
yes, of course i can swim. how far do you think it is?
one or two kilometers.
oh. great. not far at all. i don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
why?
we're going to swim "one or two kilometers" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. something goes wrong. what then?
have you told someone?
no.
i think it's a bad idea to tell anyone.
richard, it's secret. that's the whole point.
yeah, ok. forget it. we won't tell anyone.
we lost our key.
where did you lose it?
do you know the kentucky friend mouse story?"
woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. or a rat. it's an urban myth.
exactly. always happened to someone else.
so?
so there's an urban myth, well more of a rural myth, going around here at the moment. it's about a beach.
uh-huh.
francoise -
sshh. etienne will be angry if i wake him. he thinks i waste film taking photographs of the sky.
i think so too.
one night i will get the perfect photograph.
you realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. you're photographing yourself.
incredible.
there are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
so on one you are rich, on another poor. on one you are a murderer, on another the victim.
exactly.
richard, you know something -
that is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that englishmen and americans always say to french girls so that they can sleep with them.
sorry. i thought i was doing quite well.
it's just the sky, richard.
one kilometer
two.
richard?
i don't know - i'm american.
so?
we think in miles, not kilometers.
so how many miles do you think it is?
i have no idea but it looks like a long way.
too far?
if it's too far, then we'll drown. but if we don’t try then we'll never know.
everyone ok?
we're ok.
i think we're about half way.
richard - i saw a fin!
what!
a fin!
a shark fin?
i don't know, just a fin. over there. about a hundred meters.
big?
yes.
well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
nothing. i just thought you ought to know.
well to be honest, etienne, i would rather have not known about it.
i'm sorry.
a bit fucking late.
she is gone!
what happened?
she just went under the water. she was pulled under. oh god, i don't see her.
was there a shark? did you see a shark?
what about moliere?
fuck off.
