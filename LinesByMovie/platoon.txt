i know barnes six months and i'll tell ya something - that man is mean, red in his soul like a dick on a dog.
barnes gets killed, his jaws'd go on clacking...
where's he from?
barnes comes from hell.
tennessee someplace. hill country.
barnes took a bullet right there. at ia drang valley...  and the cocksucker survived - that's baaad man. that's his high, baby. high on war!
he done a year in japan in the hospital, then when he gets out, the first thing he done is re-up. four years he been in the field...
...and you know how many times he done been shot?  seven times!  seven.
the good lord works his revenge in strange ways.
yeah, you done said it. revenge on us.
does he have a metal plate in his head?
you mean he's crazy? no more crazy'n the rest of us been out in the bush too long.
well he ain't normal that's fo sure.
that's what he is... baaaa!
baaa, got no time to go to the movies. love and hate too busy fighting for possession of my soul.
where's elias come from?
'lias come naturally.
not the only man to meet his jezebel either.
so he got a reduced and come over here. nam's his freedom man, nam's his pussy. three years he been here.
three years, jesus, he's crazy as barnes...
well sometimes a man jes don' wanna go back. how you gonna talk to civilians man? people back in the world just don't give a shit, y'know what i mean, to them you're a fuckin' animal is all -
i was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking twilight zone back there - you wouldn't even know there's a war on here. my sister says to me why you have to go there like i started this...
baaaa! fuck it, they sold us out - so what! what'd you'all expect? civilian life is phoney bullshit man. they're robots man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. that's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. cause it don't really matter. don't mean shit. so what! whatcha want - a parade! fuck that too! no war time no grunt never got no respect. till he was dead - and even then! you're fighting for yourself man! you're fighting for your soul, dat's all. remember dat. and it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...love and hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...
...i can't sleep, why don't you get some sack time.
...don't feel like it either.
...beautiful night.
yeah. i love this place at night. the stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
that's a nice way of putting it.
barnes got it in for you, don't he?
barnes believes in what he's doing.
and you, do you believe?
in '65 - yeah. now...  no. what happened today's just the beginning. we're gonna lose this war...
you really think so... us?
oh shit! sometimes there's things in my head... man. grass does that to me, fucks me all up like a crazy indian...
do you believe that stuff about... knowing you're gonna die?
yeah, those are the guys that live. i really don't think death gives a shit, it's like a giant garbage can, i think it takes whatever it can get... you never know where it's gonna come from anyway... so why spin your wheels?
where's lerner?
out there man - behind the log.
where the fuck is red platoon! tell 'em to get their asses up here! what the fuck you doin' back here elias? round up your assholes and move 'em up front, we're getting chopped to shit.
barnes, listen to me... there's 5-6 spiderholes back there  next to the church.  third platoon's coming up the stream to reinforce us. flank's wide open, dinks get 3-4 snipers in these holes, when third platoon comes up, they'll get us in a crossfire with 'em. we'll shoot each other to shit, then they'll hit us with everything they got. it'll be a massacre!
sounds pretty far out to me 'lias.
maybe but i seen it happen at ia drang in '66, first cavalry and they cut us to fuckin' pieces!  give me three men, if i'm wrong, i can still roll up that flank.
...you keep pouring out that suppressing fire, barnes. i don't wanna be caught out there with my ass hanging out you hear me?
don't tell me how to fight this fucking war, 'lias, you go crying to fucking brigade on your time. out here you belong to me. now move.
taylor - get your ass over here. move!
hang tough, gator. hang in there, man, you're gonna be ok... just hang on.
i'll go with you.

yeah. back about 100 metres. he's dead, now get going, the gooks are all over the fuckin' place.
shit boy you been out in the sun too long. you try that, he'll stick it right back up your ass with a candle on it.
then what do you suggest big shot?
i suggest you watch your own asses cause barnes gonna be down on all of 'em.
then you jes gonna forget 'bout elias and all the good times we done had? right in here.
he dugged his own grave.
fuck this shit!
you guys trying to cure the headache by cutting off the head. 'lias didn't ask you to fight his battles and if there's a heaven - and god, i hope so - i know he's sitting up there drunk as a fuckin' monkey and smokin' shit cause his pains he done left down here. baaaaaaaaa!
you're wrong man! any way you cut it rhah, barnes is a murderer.
right on.
i remember first time you came in here taylor you telling me how much you admired that bastard.
i was wrong.

'people say i'm the life of the party cause i tell a joke or two although i may be laughing loud and hardy deep inside i'm blue...'

way out of anything, man. just keep your pecker up, your powder dry, the worm will turn. how many days you short?
not just me... it's the way the whole thing works. people like elias get wasted and people like barnes just go on making up rules any way they want and what do we do, we just sit around in the middle and suck on it! we just don't add up to dry shit.
