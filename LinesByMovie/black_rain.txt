i think she got to you, pappy.
you want a popsicle, go to good humor.  and do not call me 'pappy.'
still, you got to wonder how she would look in handcuffs.
... it is not like you were slow or anything... i think you did just fine.  i think you did great.
thanks.
hey, hey, where you goin'?
home.
wait up.  you know the guy who did the weismuller through the window --
-- cavello.  ronnie cavello.
he works for frank abolofia. atlantic city.  casinos.
so why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
what is this?
let go...
back-up.
get rid of it.
why?
it is not regulation.  and the only way you are going to stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he is laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
I will get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater.
nick, let's go hunting.  bag cavello.
charlie...
short shift?
yeah... i came to save you.  if you are hopeless, I will pull the plug.
it is getting too cold even for me, nick.
connie...
all right, how is the new partner?
high spirits, desire, commitment.
you will take care of that.
give me a break, would you?
if you give me one.
are you expecting anyone?
i was not expecting you.
... i found the goombah... cavello. he is --
-- i should tear your head off.
whoa, i knew you were going to say that.  i absolutely anticipated that, nick.  but i said to myself, charlie, charlie, we can move up on this, so go find nicklaus... he will be pissed for a moment, but then it will dawn on him --
-- hey, i got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
what are they doing now?
eating scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
who do you think the jap is?
maybe cavello's buying a subaru. how would i know?
i do not blame you for being sore. it will pass when we bag him.
charlie, do not do anything.  promise me?
what?
frank abolofia.
the wolf?
some party.
maybe we should do something?
charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.
what are you doing?
saving your life.
how big a package we talking about?
this by this...
dope?
not in that company.
the old man was a japanese paper manufacturer.  hotel room and rental car were full of it.
one guy do all the damage?
yeah.
thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective.
does not speak a word of english. and he will not speak japanese either. no papers.  the japanese embassy is very interested.
why?
he is wanted in japan.  they want him first.  then we can have him.
what?
you and charlie are taking the jap home, tonight.
what...?  what if i say no?
check your gun before you leave. they are not allowed in japan.  it is a nice, safe country.
why me?
they said send a detective if i could spare one.  i can always spare you.
... nick, you are the one that is always saying you never go anywhere.
i was thinking the poconos, charlie. maybe vegas.
what are you missing?  riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. that shit is sadder than ethiopia.
beats forty hours on a plane.
they say we got to turn around and come right back.  that is what they say.  i got a plan.
i call, right?  i say i got the dreaded thirty six-hour asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days.  you and i become a driving force on the local geisha scene.
not a prayer.
hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from new york.  you are going to be the biggest thing to hit town since godzilla.
what did you say?
where is the subway station, please.
nick... you up?
no.
nick, have i been a good partner?
number five with a bullet.
i just want you to know... i mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
go to sleep, charlie.
you did not take, did you...?  you hear things.
i worked the three nine in queens, charlie.
i did not know.
the lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad.  i was new, did not know shit.  when the feathers flew, i got called in front of the special prosecutor.  it is on the top of my personnel file.  they think I am dirty or i cut a deal. does not leave you with a lot of friends either way.
givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
hey, when in rome --
in rome, I will bow.
you lost a man we wanted for some time.  it was very incompetent on your part, officer.
incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
i want a gun.
it is not allowed.
we are police officers.
you are foreigners.
work with me.  i want your best detective.
hey, inspector, i do not intend to take the rap for this.
do you know what this is?
let's go.
nick, we can not just --
i said let's go, charlie.
... detective ich-iro matsu-moto. hey, we are getting mr. moto on our side.
let's grab some food.
first decent idea you have had.
this should be it...
you said that in the last two places.
this the right place?
i hope not.
getting very weird.
I would feel better if we had some heat.
maybe we should bail?
where do we start looking for this guy?
where would you look for the mafia?
where are you going, ichiro?
the mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at lombardi's.  and call me ich.
"goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  to the killer.  jerry lee lewis.
jerry lee lewis, elvis, dinky doo and the don't's.  let's book, charlie.  if he starts on motown, we will be here all night.
no, this is the place for the young yakuza.
that is what you said in the last three piss pots.
it is incredible.  hit him or something.
i do not think he would feel it.
squid?
pussy, ass, soft personnel.
do not give him any more.
he gets as much as he wants.
joyce can be nice.
what did she say?
that i should let you pay for the drinks.  kampai.
... we got to keep looking.  track him down!  great balls of fire!
what is the problem here?
... he is a sorry old guy, but i like him.
he could not find his ass with both hands.
now that is the kind of motorcycle i want to see you on.
sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help?  maybe i should work on that girl joyce, she speaks the language.
nick!
give us a break...
it is ichiro.  ich.
leave the rice cake outside and go home!
could you fill me in?
why do not you ask your chief detective?
because i want you to tell me.
the young are eating the old, something that usually does not happen here.
can we skip the poetry, inspector?
you know, inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
i do not deserve ohashi's respect.
why the hell not?
i don't, that is all.
you cool, ich?
cool?
you all right?  you okay?
what does ichiro mean, anyway?
what does charlie mean?
hey, all right.
it is not your job.
he was my partner.
they are blaming it on you.  christ, conklin, you did not even tell me you lost the prisoner!
i planned on catching him, captain.
how?  you do not know the place.  you do not know the language.  get on the plane.
he killed a police officer.
your plane's at nine a.m.  be on it. that is orders.  period.
what happened?
they made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
it may be too soon to talk about it. when someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  a tie, a pen.
why were not you at the platform?
i could not keep up.  my shame is complete.
you must leave?
yeah...
I will get him for you, nick.
ich said you left.
there was a change in plans.
dead gaiijin's are big news.
gaiijin?
an outside person.  a foreigner.  a barbarian.  you, me.  more you.
i could use some help.  show me around.  I will pay you for your time.
i do not give tours.
you can count on the truth from people who do not like you.
you have a helluva way of asking for help.
you have a helluva way of answering.
look, you need ich.  I have been here five years and i still can not read all the street signs.
maybe I am a quicker learner.
i do not think so.
I have continued working on the case!
i can see that.
how did you get this?
i stole them.
know her?
we can ask someone i used to work with.  a criminal.  someone i pay money to...
a snitch?
what is he saying?
he says they are very nice.  he wants to know if you have anymore.
nick, no one's seen kobo in three days.  he might not even be in tokyo.
only one way to find out... get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
you said you could keep up with her! 'no problem, nick-san.'
no.  do not say anything.  do not do anything, and for christ's sake, do not apologize!
nick...
what did i tell you?
there she is!
did i say that?
you toler -- yes, tolerate me.
are we getting married?
you are doing fine, ich.  now drop it, okay?
sure.
nick...
if you are going to give me a hard time, wait outside.
work, lunch, groceries, laundry... fabulous...
four goddamn days.  this is going nowhere...
she ever pull down her shades?
sure, but then i just pull out the photos.
chikuwa, hampen, kobu, konnayaku, ganmodoki --
ichiro --
broiled fish paste cake, kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
smells like bayonne at low tide.
do not be an ass.
he is on duty.
i paid for that.
yakuza.
good.  very good...
she disappeared... shit!
you were too far behind.
you can not come in.  they do not want --
gaiijin.
I will check it out.
if i smell one drop of scotch on your breath, my friend --
you can trust me.
I am not drunk...
we are through.  i mean it.  this is the end of the line, matsumoto.
nick --
shut-up.
... a godfather.  his man was killed at the printing plant.
i want to yank kobo.
not without a small army, nicklaus- san.
ich, my name is nick.  not nicklaus, not nicklaus-san, not nick-san. nick.
san is an honorable title.
keep the change.
I am taking you back.
nick!
a few minutes faster, we might have nailed him.
what is this?
your visa has expired.  be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
while you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
look.
hey...!  hey, I am talking to you, inspector!
twenty-four hours, detective.
where does this sugai live?
a resort city, beppu.
i want to go talk to him.
what...?  why?
because he knows how to get to our man.
he will never speak to a gaiijin.
I will be a nice gaiijin.
it is very small.
big enough.
it is illegal, nick.
it is a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, nick.  no.  i will not put myself in danger for you anymore.
you know where i can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I am buying.
somebody must be suffering somewhere, you are being so nice.
i need your help, joyce.
where is ich?
unavailable.
I have heard of sugai.  I have also heard of the emperor.  they are both national treasures.  one's a hood.
i need someone to translate for me.
my japanese is not that hot... besides, you will never get in.
it is my last shot.  i have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
and I am supposed to care?
you could fake it.
you are wrong to sell ich short.
he drinks.
he is got a reason.
where is the wife?
you met her.
I would invite you up but i know you would hate the incense.  i chant.
what do you chant?
'nam oyo ranged kyo.'  you think it is dumb of course.
not if it works.  I will meet you at the train?
i do not remember saying yes.
i do not remember you saying no.
they want your autograph.
who am i supposed to be?
this little guy thinks you are robert redford... the other one thinks you are charles bronson...
tell them I am not.
what is in the box?
for sugai.  caviar, french cheese, ham... if you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, sugai may feel obligated to see you.
so i bring some cheese?
we are in?
the cheese...
seven years work by the finest engraver.  mass produced, sequentially numbered.  the best there has ever been, mr. conklin.
I am impressed.  but let's use the short form.  I am looking for --
-- kobo... i know.  he killed two of my partners.  one in new york, one at the printing plant.
i took kobo from the street.  i gave him a home, a future... but my ways were too slow for him... i served seven years in prison for my boss when i was a young man.  kobo would not serve seven minutes for his oyabun.  he was supposed to take over this syndicate when i retired.
i want him.
he will be dealt with.
our associates in new york were close to closing a deal with us.
the families who control the casinos?
yes.  unlike our syndicates, your criminals do not understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... we can not afford not to deal with them.
imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
the feds would be onto you in a month.
not with these bills.  and even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?
why tell me this?
the other plate is currently in new york, in the hands of kobo's man. find it for me.
you trust me?
I will pay you.
with these?
swiss bank deposit.  gold bullion. whatever you want.  you know the city and the police.
if i say no?
you are smarter than kobo.  you know the price of deceit.  think about it.
i do not have to.
no...
let's go.  him first.
nick, you can not do this.
it is done.  you do not have to come.
grab the keys, ich, and get inside.
no.
not now, man, okay, not now.  work with me.
start it.
i can't...
good.
he will find out you took me.  I am unprotected.  he will kill us.  all of us.  you do not stand a chance.
you will get ich killed.
no one's keeping him here.
bullshit, nick.  and do not tell me this is all just about charlie. it is not.
why would you care?
i still think you are a bastard.
what if i chant?
would not help.  watch out for ich.
that was not our deal.
you want him dead too.
after a court convicts him.  he belongs to me.
just one, compadre... kampai.
kampai.
you did great, ichiro.
i called ohashi, he will be waiting.  i like him waiting.
ugly... a couple of thousand years they have been bound by these little rules.  looking in.  always afraid. ugly little lives...
save it, i already took the tour.
you are a lucky man.  where you come from a man can stand out.  it is expected.  here a man is made to look a fool for standing out.
i like your friend, joyce.  you are lucky.
guess I am on a roll.
she is such a long way home for you.
time, I have got plenty of.
this is my stop.
I am amused.
do not be.
sugai will not give it to me, you know that.
then take it from him.
your plane leaves at six.  two officers will escort you.
for god's sake, ohashi, i need your help.  let me out of here!
you had my help, detective.
if anything happens to her while I am here --
-- do you know where she is, detective?  do you know how to find her?  even where to start?  we will find them.
i have to get to sugai.
goodbye, officer.
i was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
i followed them.  an hour from the train station.
how many men?
i could not tell.
joyce?
i do not know.
we need the plate to negotiate with.
someone attacked him.
now we have got nothing to negotiate with.
thank you.  you have one?
a wife.  she left.
I am sorry.
me too.
what is that for?
luck.
you know, nick, we can not lose.
why is that?
because we are the biggest things to hit this town since godzilla.
you all right?
yes...
call for help.
can not make you change your mind?
last time you asked me to come along i nearly got a hole in my head.
might be different in new york.
maybe.  if i come visit, we can find out.
I would like that.
louder, pal, louder.
joyce, give the assistant chief inspector a drink, would you?
... remember, counterfeiting is the feds.  they will be all over abolofia's place.  stick tight. you i.d. the other plate, he does real time.
right.
think we will get him, nick?
we can not lose.
how can you be so sure?
