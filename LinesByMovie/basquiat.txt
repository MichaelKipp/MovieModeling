hey  willie mays.
willie mays.
who is that?
the devil, man. rene ricard. art critic  writes for artforum. people read him. tell him who you are..
who am i?
samo.
oh yeah..
ok! goodbye!
pipe down, lech. let him order.
you nuts? let him order? you on his side? you are not such a good waitress. you get out, too.
i just do not think you are being fair.
i need this?
i need this?
no, do not tell me  you just got fired by your crazy boss.
i guess you did.
guess i just got sick of him.
can i walk you home?
i think i could do that alone.
have you been camping? you could use a scrub.
I am clean. smell me. i always smell good. i do not know why, i just do!
you do! you definitely do.
just come to the mudd club on friday.
i do not go there. too many party girls.
party girls? can i call you?
yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477- 0496.
"she loves me. oh yeah she loves me! she loooooooves me, oh yeah she loves me!" bring me some chicken, baby!
would you shut the fuck up? you hear what I am doing?
yeah man. I am jealous. you are always great, benny.  "her name is g-i-n-a gina and she lo-oooves me." i did say chicken!
i knew i left these somewhere. one of these'll send your kids to college someday.  here  i made this for you.
thanks.  your dad called again  something about a job.
you got a date already?
we are getting married. she said she could tell i was a great artist  she could see it in my eyes. she said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
that is a beautiful name. french?
haitian. I am going to kill myself. I am taking pills. reds, blues, greens.
what? wait a minute... talk to me.
life doesn't... make... sense. this city's k-killing me. i want my liquid hijack marlboros!
what? life's beautiful. depression is not permanent. do not you believe that?  what is it  did your girlfriend leave you?
no! i have a boyfriend. he loves me.
you see? you have someone to live for.
no, i don't. I am alone. we all are. especially here. the world's unjust. the respect fools get. the disrespect i get.
what is it you want? respect? i have respect for you, just for making this call. one philosopher said "sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." think about it. feel it.
you do not even know me. i want real respect.
what? what do you want?
fame. my liquid hijack marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.
i thought you hated this place?
i do.  i just said that. i was never here before. i actually like it.
wanna go get some breakfast?
a friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. he is an electrician. i was supposed to be there an hour ago.
jean, could you get me a phillips screwdriver?
a what?
a phillips head. from the toolbox.
yeah.
'phillips head,' right?
yeah.
you do not have any!!!
that is impossible. I have got, like, five of 'em!
jean? hold this, please.  you will get there. but it is good to have something to fall back on. that is why i became an electrician. it pays the rent. y'know, I am an artist, too.
i did not know.
i sculpt. I am really just starting to find myself. how old are you? twenty? you are just like i used to be. I am forty-one. and I am glad i have not gotten any recognition. it gave me time to develop.
my name is jean michel basquiat. have you heard of me?
no. should i have?
I am a painter, too.
really. huh. too bad.
come on, jean. get rid of your cigarette. concentrate.
i am... on gina.  fuck  i did not think we were actually going to do this.
concentrate on the ball. shoot.
you are shattering all my myths.
about what?
your people.
oh  you mean black people!
whatever. famous. to where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
ummm... four years. six to get rich.
famous people are usually pretty stupid. you are too smart. you would get bored to death. you do not wanna be like john henry  fighting the machine. just do what you do. it is about integrity. follow your heart.
who is john henry?
oh man! folklore guy  worked on the railroad. y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. then one day they invented a machine to do it. and he says "fuck that, I am a man" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. it takes two days. neck and neck the whole time. they get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  got a cigarette?
so then what?
he drops dead! see? just do your shit like you do it! your friends like you, you get laid, everyone walks by, sees your stuff everywhere. it is good. what else do you want?
what are you doing? you are doing something.
he is the best painter in the world. I am going to give him one of these.
do not give him anything, man. your art's worth a lot. trade. that is what real artists do with each other. besides, he will just use you. he is famous for that.
you wanna buy some ignorant art? ten bucks.
ignorant art?
yeah... like  stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
ohhh. that is new. that sounds good.
ten bucks apiece.
i can give you five. you did not do very much to these.
you do not even work on your stuff!
it does not matter how much you worked on them. it matters how much you can get for them.
i can get ten.
check you later, man.
hi gina.
basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! what are you doing?
c'mon, baby, i painted them for you. they are beautiful now.
I am going to my parents this weekend. what am i going to wear?  how could you do that to me?
... I will buy you some new ones.
you do not have any fucking money..
do you know what he is saying?
what who is saying?
manzanita....  ... if one day i die, and you read this piece of paper, i want you to know how much i love you. although I will never see you again, gypsy, gypsy, your hair, your hair, your face, your face'
willie mays!!! willie mays!!!
come on in!
... what is the matter?
oh, god, basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. how the fuck could you do that to yourself?
you are back.
it is monday morning.
it is not sunday? i missed you. you should not leave me alone.
you are blaming me? i had to go see my family.
I am your family.
basquiat, what did you take?
basquiat, do not lie.  this is smack.
you want some?
we got beat.
for real?
you gonna carry that around all night?
yeah... I will paint on it.
chill, man! be cool! this is not even my apartment!
oh man, you a fine nigga! you know that?
cut it out, man! and do not be callin' me that shit!
who did this?  who did this?
i do not know. i told you, this is not my apartment.
naaaa. poor thing has a little dick.
how do you know?
just look at him.  little silver thingies on his cowboy boots? honey, i do not think so.
mothafuckah!
that is the same guy who did this painting.
i know that. do not let him get away.
you heard of albert milo. i made that niggah. I am rene ricard. did not you read "not about albert milo?" i know who to hype. baby, I am going to make you a star.
can you put me in the ring with him?
i can put you in the ring with him. even book the dates.  but those big boys know how to fight. they could make you look real sissy.  i was looking at that painting upstairs. it is the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  so what is your real name? 'samo?'
jean michel basquiat.
you look fucking beautiful, beautiful.
well thanks!
no.
you have not been by lately.
I would love to see some more of your work... where is your studio?
you name it, i paint there.
well, i do not want to get mugged on a bowery street corner. maybe i could find a place for you to work. take my card.
you want a drink?
which island of hawaii do you want our house to be on? maui? kaui? molokai?
i had not thought about it.
oahu, lanai, niihau, kahoolawee
staten island would be ok.
it looks done.
think so?
... babies.
you mean babies with you?
what is wrong with me?
you are your own baby.
who is it?
annina nosei.
who?
is jean michel here?
no.
these are great.
are not they?
how much for these five?
you should talk to him about this.
I am interested in showing jean's work.
i really think you should talk to him about this.
when?
how about right now?
what is the rush, john henry?
i am not john henry.
good.
what is your fuckin' problem, anyway?
i do not really have any problems.
good. what do you have?
what is your fuckin' problem? you get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
'uppity?' like as in 'uppity nigger?'
that is not how i meant it.  for all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! you can never tell.
hey fuck you! i deserve this shit. you are just jealous 'cause it am not happening to you!
uh huhh... band practice?  it is benny. he wants to know why you are not at band practice...?
fuck...  i forgot about that.
fuck band practice... if you are going to be a painter you are going to have to break a few hearts  you do not wanna be like tony bennett..
tony bennett... what do you mean?
singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
i did not know tony bennett painted.
my point exactly.
so keep painting.
yes, boss.  if you are so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
you are news. i want the scoop. i write it down. when i speak, no one believes me. but when i write it down, people know it is true.  there is never been a black painter in art history that is been considered really important, you know?
so what?
so shut up and keep painting..
what time is it?
5:11.
that one's for you.
thanks... I will take it tonight.
i can't. after the show.
hey  it is the big a.m..
rene's been telling me about your work.
is this finished yet?
i do not know.
when is your show?
not sure. how was yours?
i have not decided yet.  rene, you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow. i wanna make a painting of you.
tom and cynthia kruger.
i know.
I will take three big macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
you want three big macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
forget it .i'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a big mac, and two apple pies.
you only want one big mac?
how can i ever thank you?
I would like to squeeze your titties.
come on.
wanna mac?
no, I would like the scarf.
have a mac.
i do not eat junk food.
oh. i did not know. I will take you to the best restaurant in town.  you will miss a great meal and I will keep the scarf, anyway. what is your name?
you are a fast mover.
no name? that is ok. I will just call you big pink.
hi.
hi.
what is that?
a present i picked up for you.
andy, man, thanks for coming. I would like to paint your jacket.
my jacket? gee, great...  your show looks great. quite a turnout. you look great. you kids. you drink red wine with fish. you can do anything! make paintings in the basement of your gallery? first time I have heard of that!
jean michel, this is mary boone. she is got the great new gallery.
yeah, i met her already.
jean, your parents are here.
hi dad. hi nora.
you should not have put it in the show. this is the one i absolutely have to have. i really love it.
sure, ok..
do you think i could borrow your limousine? I will get it back to you in an hour.
it is ok. just have him bring you to dinner at mr. chow's later. we will be there.
you fucking little whore! you sold my painting! I am going to tell you something, brother  when you are climbing up the ladder of success, do not kick out the rungs! believe that shit.
I will make you another one.
forget it.
i really... admire you.
me? why?
you did it! you made it. I am a painter, too.
that is great.
would you check out my studio some time?
sure. I would be glad to.
what is your name, man?
they call me steve, but i prefer shenge.
nice to meet you, shenge. want a job?
nixon lives in saddle river, new york.
saddle river's in new jersey.
saddle river, new york!
it is in new jersey.
new york.
i think it is in new jersey.
it is in new york.
oh, i did not know that.
i hear your show was sold out already. there is a very important collector who is interested in some of your works.
bring him over sometime. i have some other stuff to show him.
it is great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I will handle it for you. everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
sure.
what is it that gets you out of bed in the morning?
i hate this. turn that off.
... can you... decipher this for us?
decipher?
yes. what do they... stand for?
they are just words.
yes, i understand  but where do you take them from?
where? do you ask miles where he got that note from? where do you take your words from?  everywhere.
what are they?
leeches. a long list of leeches.  it looks good like that.
hmmm. and 'parasites.'  you seem to be a primal expressionist.
you mean like an ape?
a primate?
well, you said that.  you have got a lot of references from leonardo da vinci, do not you?
oh, that is a "leonardo's greatest hits" painting. you like it?
yes, but as a black painter
i use a lot of colors  not only black.
what?
I am not black.
you are not?
not what?
not black.
no, I am haitian-puerto rican.
yes, yes... let's talk about that.... your roots... your father is from haiti, is not he?
yup.
hmmmm. interesting. and when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
we do not hang them at home, y'know  just in the streets..
i see..  and... how do you respond to being called  hmmm...   yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
who said that?
why, that is from time magazine.
no, he said i was the eddie murphy of the art world. he said the eddie murphy.
is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution?
or rather, do you think you are being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto?
are those the only two possibilities?  you wanna french fry?
ok. one last thing. is there any anger in you? any anger in your work?
should there be?
tell me about it. what are you angry about?
is that the best quality you have?
yeah, it is the best one.
I will take the whole tin.
it is three thousand dollars!
I will take it.  andy, gimme three thousand dollars.  just the caviar  I will get the rest.
i wish they would quit writing this shit about me.
that is good. at least they are interested.
everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors  anything with a samo tag on it.  the other day, i just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so i did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. a week later this gallery calls me up: "somebody's offering us the drawing. should we buy it for five thousand?"
wow... stop giving them away.  i got an invitation to model for comme de garcons... you wanna do it with me?
yeah  I would do that... you could teach me.
gee. i do not need to. you are a natural. you should sign up with my modeling agent.
cool.
my dog, archie... i woke up with flea bites... creepy. i ran out and bought flea collars. they work really well.
let's leave this town and go someplace. some island.
let's go to the carnegie museum. they have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. it is really great. it is in pittsburg.
ouch..
what is wrong?
that girl looks just like my old girlfriend gina.
do you still love her?
yeah. i really blew it. i still think about her.
well, have you asked her to come back?
so are you really friends with andy? he seems like such a weirdo.
he is not. he is out of town and he calls me every day. what is weird about him?
do not you think he is using you?
why does everybody say that? he is the only person i know who does not need to use me.
would you like to see the wine list?
chateau latour '64, please.
so. are you ready? i start columbia next fall. of course, there is like, a year of pre-med stuff, but  whatever. I am really excited.  and: rene gave me a job as his secretary. his poems are getting published.
how is he?
pretty much the same.
wow. congratulations. i hate that asshole.  thanks for coming. i guess i just wanted to find out how you are
what is that about?
forget it.
that is amazing. what year is it?
george?
I am sorry, mr. basquiat.
see that table over there? I would like to pay their bill.
yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
really?
yeah.
very well.
baby, i think about you a lot. I am really sorry about everything. you have to believe me. I am serious. i wish, y'know, that we were
i do not believe it, jean  they are picking straws.
you do not have to be sorry. there is no one to blame. jean, you are a real artist. i thought i was one. you made me realize i wasn't.
what is his name?
what do you think?
i like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. but the black one's filled up with too many heads...  I would take some of them out.  i think you are painting too fast. i would not put in so many heads. let it breathe a bit.
it is always how you would do it. this is my version.
you are right. it is your version. you should come over to the studio sometime.
why, so you could humiliate me?
no, i wanted to make a painting of you.
what is with the wigs?
I am going to send them to my friends for christmas presents.
you think those are good presents? who wants an old wig?
piss painting?
i wanted to make a few more of these. frank's been drinking this mexican beer. it makes a good green.
how come you are not peeing on them yourself?
i do not like beer.
that was my favorite part!
we can do better. it needed more white.
i do not even have any friends anymore besides you. and everyone says "warhol? that death-warmed over person on drugs? he is just using you."
gee. you should not take it so seriously, jean. that is why you can not stop taking drugs. you always think people do not like you. everyone likes you.
people are only interested in you because you are famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
bruno called. in europe, people are saying you are going to die from drugs. they think they can cash in on your death.
when i was poor, everybody doubted i could make it. when i got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he will never keep it up.' now everyone says `he's killing himself.' so i clean up, and then they say `look. his art's dead.' i do not take drugs, anyway. I am healthy now.
after the show we should take a nice long vacation. maybe go to hawaii. that is what I am going to do. I am going to give up painting and start playing music again. i wanna sing.
that would be a pity because you are a real painter.
yo! jean, this is ramellzee.
yo... you know why rammellzee's here, do not you?
uh-oh!
I am here for an interrogation. you have been called a graffiti artist and i wanna know why. all i see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
man, i was up on him years ago on the irt.
you are selling and ending the culture. not one bit of information. only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
that is ignorant.
hey, rene.
thanks again for not inviting me. I am only here on business.
paint it out.
out?
yeah... maybe just his arms.  put some cerulean blue there.
it is andy again.
still not here.
in this corner?
yeah..
you want me to put it here?
use your fucking instinct.
it is maria portos. what should we do?
why do not you try letting her in, steve  i mean shenge.
get up. she will not buy anything if she sees me working on it!
wanna bet? if you show too much respect for people with money, they do not have respect for you.
blue? where?
what is wrong with you today?
jean michel... crawling from the wreckage?
i need a dealer.
you have a bunch of them, do not you? albert milo walks in from another room.
naa..
let's get out of here.
see ya in an hour.  so what do you think?
bruno spoke to me already. we could talk about it.
I am here.
ok. I will be at your studio thursday three o'clock.
this is painted on a backdrop from the kabuki theater in japan. i painted it after joseph beuys died. a rebirth painting. i felt like he could have painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. the chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
do you ever get sick of it?
of what?
the whole thing  painting.
no. it is one of the few times i feel good. i used to have to go to work and cook every day. that i got sick of.
what about the shit they write?
you are asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. i read that. the person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. that is your enemy, not your audience. your audience has not even been born yet. it is a lie that art is popular. the only thing popular about it is that it is written about in newspapers. I am surprised when anybody comes to my openings. there are about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and andy's one of them.
i have not felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
as long as I have known andy, he is never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs. he is painted my picture, we have eaten dinner in god knows how many places together. but he does not care about me. he cares about you. you are the only person he cares about. he is your friend. fuck that article. you want a toasted bagel with cream cheese?
hi.
hi.
I have seen you before. i like your paintings a lot. your hair was different.
you like your dad's paintings?
some of them.
stand still.
see you later.
thanks
b.b. it is me  jean! what is the matter? no snow in switzerland this year?
i did not see you.
what do you mean?
you have not heard? andy's dead.
she is good.
i guess it was a long time ago.
come on, let's get out of here.
sit down! you are going to fall out!
me fall? let's get some drugs!
drugs??!
medicine, man! like health food. I am taking care of my health!
