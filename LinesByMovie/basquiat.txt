hey  willie mays.
willie mays.
who's that?
the devil, man. rene ricard. art critic  writes for artforum. people read him. tell him who you are..
who am i?
samo.
oh yeah..
ok! goodbye!
pipe down, lech. let him order.
you nuts? let him order? you on his side? you're not such a good waitress. you get out, too.
i just don't think you're being fair.
i need this?
i need this?
no, don't tell me  you just got fired by your crazy boss.
i guess you did.
guess i just got sick of him.
can i walk you home?
i think i could do that alone.
have you been camping? you could use a scrub.
i'm clean. smell me. i always smell good. i don't know why, i just do!
you do! you definitely do.
just come to the mudd club on friday.
i don't go there. too many party girls.
party girls? can i call you?
yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477- 0496.
"she loves me. oh yeah she loves me! she loooooooves me, oh yeah she loves me!" bring me some chicken, baby!
would you shut the fuck up? you hear what i'm doing?
yeah man. i'm jealous. you're always great, benny.  "her name is g-i-n-a gina and she lo-oooves me." i did say chicken!
i knew i left these somewhere. one of these'll send your kids to college someday.  here  i made this for you.
thanks.  your dad called again  something about a job.
you got a date already?
we're getting married. she said she could tell i was a great artist  she could see it in my eyes. she said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
that's a beautiful name. french?
haitian. i'm going to kill myself. i'm taking pills. reds, blues, greens.
what? wait a minute... talk to me.
life doesn't... make... sense. this city's k-killing me. i want my liquid hijack marlboros!
what? life's beautiful. depression isn't permanent. don't you believe that?  what is it  did your girlfriend leave you?
no! i have a boyfriend. he loves me.
you see? you have someone to live for.
no, i don't. i'm alone. we all are. especially here. the world's unjust. the respect fools get. the disrespect i get.
what is it you want? respect? i have respect for you, just for making this call. one philosopher said "sadness is a sin against the richness of the world." think about it. feel it.
you don't even know me. i want real respect.
what? what do you want?
fame. my liquid hijack marlboros and the moon and the cow that jumped over it.
i thought you hated this place?
i do.  i just said that. i was never here before. i actually like it.
wanna go get some breakfast?
a friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. he's an electrician. i was supposed to be there an hour ago.
jean, could you get me a phillips screwdriver?
a what?
a phillips head. from the toolbox.
yeah.
'phillips head,' right?
yeah.
you don't have any!!!
that's impossible. i've got, like, five of 'em!
jean? hold this, please.  you'll get there. but it's good to have something to fall back on. that's why i became an electrician. it pays the rent. y'know, i'm an artist, too.
i didn't know.
i sculpt. i'm really just starting to find myself. how old are you? twenty? you're just like i used to be. i'm forty-one. and i'm glad i haven't gotten any recognition. it gave me time to develop.
my name is jean michel basquiat. have you heard of me?
no. should i have?
i'm a painter, too.
really. huh. too bad.
come on, jean. get rid of your cigarette. concentrate.
i am... on gina.  fuck  i didn't think we were actually gonna do this.
concentrate on the ball. shoot.
you're shattering all my myths.
about what?
your people.
oh  you mean black people!
whatever. famous. to where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else.
ummm... four years. six to get rich.
famous people are usually pretty stupid. you're too smart. you'd get bored to death. you don't wanna be like john henry  fighting the machine. just do what you do. it's about integrity. follow your heart.
who's john henry?
oh man! folklore guy  worked on the railroad. y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. then one day they invented a machine to do it. and he says "fuck that, i'm a man" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. it takes two days. neck and neck the whole time. they get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  got a cigarette?
so then what?
he drops dead! see? just do your shit like you do it! your friends like you, you get laid, everyone walks by, sees your stuff everywhere. it's good. what else do you want?
what're you doing? you're doing something.
he's the best painter in the world. i'm gonna give him one of these.
don't give him anything, man. your art's worth a lot. trade. that's what real artists do with each other. besides, he'll just use you. he's famous for that.
you wanna buy some ignorant art? ten bucks.
ignorant art?
yeah... like  stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
ohhh. that's new. that sounds good.
ten bucks apiece.
i can give you five. you didn't do very much to these.
you don't even work on your stuff!
it doesn't matter how much you worked on them. it matters how much you can get for them.
i can get ten.
check you later, man.
hi gina.
basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! what are you doing?
c'mon, baby, i painted them for you. they're beautiful now.
i'm going to my parents this weekend. what am i going to wear?  how could you do that to me?
... i'll buy you some new ones.
you don't have any fucking money..
do you know what he's saying?
what who's saying?
manzanita....  ... if one day i die, and you read this piece of paper, i want you to know how much i love you. although i'll never see you again, gypsy, gypsy, your hair, your hair, your face, your face'
willie mays!!! willie mays!!!
come on in!
... what's the matter?
oh, god, basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. how the fuck could you do that to yourself?
you're back.
it's monday morning.
it's not sunday? i missed you. you shouldn't leave me alone.
you're blaming me? i had to go see my family.
i'm your family.
basquiat, what did you take?
basquiat, don't lie.  this is smack.
you want some?
we got beat.
for real?
you gonna carry that around all night?
yeah... i'll paint on it.
chill, man! be cool! this isn't even my apartment!
oh man, you a fine nigga! you know that?
cut it out, man! and don't be callin' me that shit!
who did this?  who did this?
i don't know. i told you, this isn't my apartment.
naaaa. poor thing has a little dick.
how do you know?
just look at him.  little silver thingies on his cowboy boots? honey, i don't think so.
mothafuckah!
that's the same guy who did this painting.
i know that. don't let him get away.
you heard of albert milo. i made that niggah. i'm rene ricard. didn't you read "not about albert milo?" i know who to hype. baby, i'm gonna make you a star.
can you put me in the ring with him?
i can put you in the ring with him. even book the dates.  but those big boys know how to fight. they could make you look real sissy.  i was looking at that painting upstairs. it's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything.  so what's your real name? 'samo?'
jean michel basquiat.
you look fucking beautiful, beautiful.
well thanks!
no.
you haven't been by lately.
i'd love to see some more of your work... where's your studio?
you name it, i paint there.
well, i don't want to get mugged on a bowery street corner. maybe i could find a place for you to work. take my card.
you want a drink?
which island of hawaii do you want our house to be on? maui? kaui? molokai?
i hadn't thought about it.
oahu, lanai, niihau, kahoolawee
staten island would be ok.
it looks done.
think so?
... babies.
you mean babies with you?
what's wrong with me?
you're your own baby.
who is it?
annina nosei.
who?
is jean michel here?
no.
these are great.
aren't they?
how much for these five?
you should talk to him about this.
i'm interested in showing jean's work.
i really think you should talk to him about this.
when?
how about right now?
what's the rush, john henry?
i ain't john henry.
good.
what's your fuckin' problem, anyway?
i don't really have any problems.
good. what do you have?
what's your fuckin' problem? you get a girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with me.
'uppity?' like as in 'uppity nigger?'
that's not how i meant it.  for all you know, you might just be a flash in the pan! you can never tell.
hey fuck you! i deserve this shit. you're just jealous 'cause it ain't happening to you!
uh huhh... band practice?  it's benny. he wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
fuck...  i forgot about that.
fuck band practice... if you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts  you don't wanna be like tony bennett..
tony bennett... what do you mean?
singing on stage and painting in your spare time.
i didn't know tony bennett painted.
my point exactly.
so keep painting.
yes, boss.  if you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement?
you're news. i want the scoop. i write it down. when i speak, no one believes me. but when i write it down, people know it's true.  there's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know?
so what?
so shut up and keep painting..
what time is it?
5:11.
that one's for you.
thanks... i'll take it tonight.
i can't. after the show.
hey  it's the big a.m..
rene's been telling me about your work.
is this finished yet?
i don't know.
when's your show?
not sure. how was yours?
i haven't decided yet.  rene, you wanna come over to the studio tomorrow. i wanna make a painting of you.
tom and cynthia kruger.
i know.
i'll take three big macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
you want three big macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.
forget it .i'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a big mac, and two apple pies.
you only want one big mac?
how can i ever thank you?
i'd like to squeeze your titties.
come on.
wanna mac?
no, i'd like the scarf.
have a mac.
i don't eat junk food.
oh. i didn't know. i'll take you to the best restaurant in town.  you'll miss a great meal and i'll keep the scarf, anyway. what's your name?
you're a fast mover.
no name? that's ok. i'll just call you big pink.
hi.
hi.
what's that?
a present i picked up for you.
andy, man, thanks for coming. i'd like to paint your jacket.
my jacket? gee, great...  your show looks great. quite a turnout. you look great. you kids. you drink red wine with fish. you can do anything! make paintings in the basement of your gallery? first time i've heard of that!
jean michel, this is mary boone. she's got the great new gallery.
yeah, i met her already.
jean, your parents are here.
hi dad. hi nora.
you shouldn't have put it in the show. this is the one i absolutely have to have. i really love it.
sure, ok..
do you think i could borrow your limousine? i'll get it back to you in an hour.
it's ok. just have him bring you to dinner at mr. chow's later. we'll be there.
you fucking little whore! you sold my painting! i'm gonna tell you something, brother  when you're climbing up the ladder of success, don't kick out the rungs! believe that shit.
i'll make you another one.
forget it.
i really... admire you.
me? why?
you did it! you made it. i'm a painter, too.
that's great.
would you check out my studio some time?
sure. i'd be glad to.
what's your name, man?
they call me steve, but i prefer shenge.
nice to meet you, shenge. want a job?
nixon lives in saddle river, new york.
saddle river's in new jersey.
saddle river, new york!
it's in new jersey.
new york.
i think it's in new jersey.
it's in new york.
oh, i didn't know that.
i hear your show was sold out already. there's a very important collector who's interested in some of your works.
bring him over sometime. i have some other stuff to show him.
it's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, i'll handle it for you. everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio.
sure.
what is it that gets you out of bed in the morning?
i hate this. turn that off.
... can you... decipher this for us?
decipher?
yes. what do they... stand for?
they're just words.
yes, i understand  but where do you take them from?
where? do you ask miles where he got that note from? where do you take your words from?  everywhere.
what are they?
leeches. a long list of leeches.  it looks good like that.
hmmm. and 'parasites.'  you seem to be a primal expressionist.
you mean like an ape?
a primate?
well, you said that.  you've got a lot of references from leonardo da vinci, don't you?
oh, that's a "leonardo's greatest hits" painting. you like it?
yes, but as a black painter
i use a lot of colors  not only black.
what?
i'm not black.
you're not?
not what?
not black.
no, i'm haitian-puerto rican.
yes, yes... let's talk about that.... your roots... your father is from haiti, isn't he?
yup.
hmmmm. interesting. and when you grew up were there any primitives hanging in your home?
we don't hang them at home, y'know  just in the streets..
i see..  and... how do you respond to being called  hmmm...   yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
who said that?
why, that's from time magazine.
no, he said i was the eddie murphy of the art world. he said the eddie murphy.
is it true that your mother resides in a mental institution?
or rather, do you think you're being exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black artist from the ghetto?
are those the only two possibilities?  you wanna french fry?
ok. one last thing. is there any anger in you? any anger in your work?
should there be?
tell me about it. what are you angry about?
is that the best quality you have?
yeah, it's the best one.
i'll take the whole tin.
it's three thousand dollars!
i'll take it.  andy, gimme three thousand dollars.  just the caviar  i'll get the rest.
i wish they'd quit writing this shit about me.
that's good. at least they're interested.
everybody's paying top dollar for scraps of paper, refrigerator doors  anything with a samo tag on it.  the other day, i just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so i did a drawing and sold it for two bucks. a week later this gallery calls me up: "somebody's offering us the drawing. should we buy it for five thousand?"
wow... stop giving them away.  i got an invitation to model for comme de garcons... you wanna do it with me?
yeah  i'd do that... you could teach me.
gee. i don't need to. you're a natural. you should sign up with my modeling agent.
cool.
my dog, archie... i woke up with flea bites... creepy. i ran out and bought flea collars. they work really well.
let's leave this town and go someplace. some island.
let's go to the carnegie museum. they have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. it's really great. it's in pittsburg.
ouch..
what's wrong?
that girl looks just like my old girlfriend gina.
do you still love her?
yeah. i really blew it. i still think about her.
well, have you asked her to come back?
so are you really friends with andy? he seems like such a weirdo.
he's not. he's out of town and he calls me every day. what's weird about him?
don't you think he's using you?
why does everybody say that? he's the only person i know who doesn't need to use me.
would you like to see the wine list?
chateau latour '64, please.
so. are you ready? i start columbia next fall. of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but  whatever. i'm really excited.  and: rene gave me a job as his secretary. his poems are getting published.
how is he?
pretty much the same.
wow. congratulations. i hate that asshole.  thanks for coming. i guess i just wanted to find out how you're
what's that about?
forget it.
that is amazing. what year is it?
george?
i'm sorry, mr. basquiat.
see that table over there? i'd like to pay their bill.
yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
really?
yeah.
very well.
baby, i think about you a lot. i'm really sorry about everything. you have to believe me. i'm serious. i wish, y'know, that we were
i don't believe it, jean  they're picking straws.
you don't have to be sorry. there's no one to blame. jean, you're a real artist. i thought i was one. you made me realize i wasn't.
what's his name?
what do you think?
i like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. but the black one's filled up with too many heads...  i'd take some of them out.  i think you're painting too fast. i wouldn't put in so many heads. let it breathe a bit.
it's always how you would do it. this is my version.
you're right. it's your version. you should come over to the studio sometime.
why, so you could humiliate me?
no, i wanted to make a painting of you.
what's with the wigs?
i'm going to send them to my friends for christmas presents.
you think those are good presents? who wants an old wig?
piss painting?
i wanted to make a few more of these. frank's been drinking this mexican beer. it makes a good green.
how come you're not peeing on them yourself?
i don't like beer.
that was my favorite part!
we can do better. it needed more white.
i don't even have any friends anymore besides you. and everyone says "warhol? that death-warmed over person on drugs? he's just using you."
gee. you shouldn't take it so seriously, jean. that's why you can't stop taking drugs. you always think people don't like you. everyone likes you.
people are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.
bruno called. in europe, people are saying you're gonna die from drugs. they think they can cash in on your death.
when i was poor, everybody doubted i could make it. when i got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' now everyone says `he's killing himself.' so i clean up, and then they say `look. his art's dead.' i don't take drugs, anyway. i'm healthy now.
after the show we should take a nice long vacation. maybe go to hawaii. that's what i'm gonna do. i'm going to give up painting and start playing music again. i wanna sing.
that would be a pity because you're a real painter.
yo! jean, this is ramellzee.
yo... you know why rammellzee's here, don't you?
uh-oh!
i'm here for an interrogation. you've been called a graffiti artist and i wanna know why. all i see are scribble scrabble abstractions!
man, i was up on him years ago on the irt.
you're selling and ending the culture. not one bit of information. only to get the money and growl with the power, man.
that's ignorant.
hey, rene.
thanks again for not inviting me. i'm only here on business.
paint it out.
out?
yeah... maybe just his arms.  put some cerulean blue there.
it's andy again.
still not here.
in this corner?
yeah..
you want me to put it here?
use your fucking instinct.
it's maria portos. what should we do?
why don't you try letting her in, steve  i mean shenge.
get up. she won't buy anything if she sees me working on it!
wanna bet? if you show too much respect for people with money, they don't have respect for you.
blue? where?
what's wrong with you today?
jean michel... crawling from the wreckage?
i need a dealer.
you have a bunch of them, don't you? albert milo walks in from another room.
naa..
let's get out of here.
see ya in an hour.  so what do you think?
bruno spoke to me already. we could talk about it.
i'm here.
ok. i'll be at your studio thursday three o'clock.
this is painted on a backdrop from the kabuki theater in japan. i painted it after joseph beuys died. a rebirth painting. i felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. the chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
do you ever get sick of it?
of what?
the whole thing  painting.
no. it's one of the few times i feel good. i used to have to go to work and cook every day. that i got sick of.
what about the shit they write?
you're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. i read that. the person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. that's your enemy, not your audience. your audience hasn't even been born yet. it's a lie that art is popular. the only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. i'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. there're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and andy's one of them.
i haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
as long as i've known andy, he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs. he's painted my picture, we've eaten dinner in god knows how many places together. but he doesn't care about me. he cares about you. you're the only person he cares about. he's your friend. fuck that article. you want a toasted bagel with cream cheese?
hi.
hi.
i've seen you before. i like your paintings a lot. your hair was different.
you like your dad's paintings?
some of them.
stand still.
see you later.
thanks
b.b. it's me  jean! what's the matter? no snow in switzerland this year?
i didn't see you.
what do you mean?
you haven't heard? andy's dead.
she's good.
i guess it was a long time ago.
come on, let's get out of here.
sit down! you're gonna fall out!
me fall? let's get some drugs!
drugs??!
medicine, man! like health food. i'm taking care of my health!
