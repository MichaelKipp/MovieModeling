salvy, would i steer you wrong? let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
hey but joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. the money's with your brother.
what do you want from my life, salvy? he's my brother.
he ain't doin' the right thing. he's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. can't you make him understand that?
hey, leave the kids alone.
get lost.  hey kids, "a cop is a rat." remember that, "a rat."
this looks done.
it's not done.
it looks done. i'll take it the way it is.
here's your steak. you can't wait for it to be done. here.
here's your carrots. you're in such a hurry. you can't wait.
no, i can't wait. you know when i wait? when it's important to wait. it's not important to wait for no steak. it's important to wait for reeves to leave the ring. it ain't important to wait for no steak! i won that fight. so, i stayed in the ring, and that way i made sure everybody knew it. i shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
i can't convince him. he's got such a thick head, i'd like to crack it open myself. believe me, my own brother. it's very hard. you don't have to convince me -- i know we should be with tommy. you talk to him. he don't listen to nobody.
look, i'm just tellin' you how tommy feels. jake is makin' it hard on himself. tommy wants him with us. it's as simple as that.
talk some sense into him, will ya? you're still his brother. if he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
all right, i'll try. see you later.
tomorrow, at the gym. don't forget.
right, the gym.
what's wrong?
nothing...
hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
i ain't ever gonna fight joe louis, that's what's the matter.
what're you talking about? he's a heavyweight. you're a middleweight.
that's what i'm sayin'. you shouldn't even think like that. it's crazy.
i tell you one thing. ok, i'll never be big enough to fight louis, but i know joey, i know...
you know?
yeah. do me a favor.
sure. what is it?
hit me in the face.
you want me to do what?
you heard me, i said hit me.
c'mon, jack. you had a few drinks.
go ahead. i ain't drunk. take your best shot. on the jaw.
jack, i got no gloves.
here's your glove.
harder.  take the towel off.
jack! enough!
go ahead.
what was that for? i know you can take punches. i can hit you from now to doomsday. what the fuck does that prove?
see that, i don't feel it. i can take it. i know i can take anybody.
answer me when i talk to you.
yeah, yeah. they just wanted to talk to you. so i...
don't ever bring those kids up here again! i'm working out, i'm killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood.
and that hard-on, salvy. who's he think he is? i'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
what are you getting so hot about -- tommy como told him to come down here...
hey, i don't care about tommy como. i don't care about jesus christ on the fuckin' cross. i gotta give them a percentage of what i make! i'm in here breaking my ass, not them. don't ever bring them up here again.
i didn't tell them to come. tommy como...
who's that?
whadda you care?
whadda ya mean, whadda i care? who is she? what's a matter? you afraid i'm gonna take her on you?
no, i'm not afraid. why? you wanna meet her?
yeah --
cause i'll go right over there and bring her here.
go 'head.
you sure you wanna meet her? don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. she's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
how do you know? you know her that good?
no, i see her around the pool. i know her. i know her like that -- not like that.
nah, not now... i wanna wait. i don't feel right...
i'm tellin' you, she'll be there, i know she'll be there.
'cause i wanna catch her alone.
how you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... i don't know if she'll be there alone... she'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
she ever go with them? like salvy?
nah, she don't go with nobody. she's only 15 years old.
what does that have to do with it? she don't look 15 to me. i heard somethin' with salvy. she was with him once or somethin', i think. it was like some blonde. that's the one...
probably. you know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
yeah, she's nice.
ah, some piece of ass, i'm tellin' you.
you wasn't with her, were you?
huh?
you wasn't with her?
with her? how?
you know, like bang her or anything?
ah, no, no. i didn't bang her. i know her from around here, that's all. you want to meet her or what?
nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. i'll wait. not now.
i'm tellin' you, she'll be there, i know she'll be there. dressed up and everything.
i don't like all those other clowns around. that's all i know.
c'mon, hurry up. we're never gonna get outa here tonight.
where you going at this hour?
what're you, a cop? i'm goin' out -- business.
you fuckin' worm, if you're going out, i'm going out.
and where you goin'?
none of your fuckin' business.
hey, watch your mouth. don't talk like that. she's still my wife.
no, but jake... how much abuse can you take.
how many times do i have to hit her? i hit her enough.
do you see her yet?
give me a chance. let me look.
joey said you wanted to meet me. is that right? you wanted to meet me?
i just wanted to say hello.
you wanted to say hello, eh? i can't believe it. when did you fall outa heaven? anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. you got a baby face. look at mine. whatcha wanna meet me for?
i don't know. 'cause you're cute.
ya hear, joey? she thinks this face is cute? hey, whatcha doin' now? you wanna go for a ride?
you don't talk very much.
i ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
i ain't no movie star. i'm just in high school.
oh no? i thought you was a movie star.
you go first. let me watch how to do this.
you don't get nothin' done by watchin'. you just gotta do it. here, i'll help you.
that's it. just grip up a little tighter. that's it. you're gonna be real good at this. how does that feel?
it feels real good.
just keep your eye on the ball.
should i hit it?
just give it a nice little tap.
i can't find my ball.
can you see it?
can you see it?
no.
what does that mean?
jake, this is your father's bedroom.
that's all right. he don't mind.
jake...
it's ok.
i'm tellin' you now, when i read this, it better not make me look bad.
jake, did i ever make you look bad before?
maybe it wasn't you, but you know what i'm talkin' about.
why not? there's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. i don't see why i shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in new york. and they're saying that you don't cooperate.
you guys know more about that than i do. i just fight...
he fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
i'm the only guy ever to beat sugar ray, and i still don't have a shot at the title.
you just fought sugar ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... are you afraid sugar ray might beat you this time?
i tell you what. you hit me here.  sugar ray hits me here.  i can't tell the difference. i just fight.
are you sure we should be doing this?
come over here.
you said never to touch you before a fight.
if you let me do it, i'll murder you. come here.
you said i couldn't. you've been good for two weeks...
come here.
take off my pants.
jake...
do what i say.
now take the rest off.
jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
go 'head. do it.
i like the gym smell.
now take your panties off.
now, touch me...  ...here.
oh, jake.
they robbed us! those fuckin' judges -- what the fuck fight were they watching? if i see them on the street, i'll break their heads. decision robinson, my fuckin' ass! those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! how else could this have happened?... what do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
whadda i gotta do, joey? i knocked him down. what did i do wrong? i don't understand.
you won and was robbed! you didn't do nothin' wrong.
i dunno. maybe i don't deserve to win. i've done a lot of bad things. i dunno...
you want us to wait for you?
no, take her home. i wanna be alone for a while. everybody go.
i just weighed myself -- i'm 161. no more deals like this janiro bullshit. i didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! what did i do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! now i don't know if i can make it down to 155. i'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if i don't make 155, i forfeit $15,000! you're supposed to know what you're doin'. you're supposed to be a manager!
you want the title shot?
say what you're gonna say.
you want the title shot or not?
say what you gotta say. don't be a smart ass.
this janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. knockout this fuckin' kid! i'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. listen to me: i'm telling you. you been killin' yourself for three years. there's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. this janiro's up-and- coming. he don't know. fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! what are you worried about? your weight? look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. they'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. and if you beat this kid janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. all right?
joey's right. janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking...
what do you mean, "good looking?"
well, he's popular. a lotta people like janiro. you beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. but, what do i know? i should keep my mouth shut, i should...
who asked you?
but, jake, i was just...
who asked you?
i was just...
who asked you?
what're you lookin' at? you lookin' at him?
no, i'm not. i'm looking at you.
don't tell me "no." i saw you lookin' at him. why, you like him?
i'm not interested in him.
you're not interested in him?
no, i'm not.
in other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
jake, c'mon now. don't start.
look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' romeo around here. did you see the way she was lookin' at him?
nah, she would never...
didn't you just see her lookin' at him? she told me no, but i don't believe her.
c'mon, jake. you know she's crazy about you.
excuse me for a minute. be right back.
don't be long. i'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
hi, tommy. how are you?
jake, sit down for a minute.
fuckin' kid! you're the best fuckin' fighter around. loved what you did to satterfield. them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. they're all afraid to fight you.
c'mon, tommy --
how you feelin'? ok? you feelin' good?
never felt better.
tony janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
he should.
this janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid.
how's the weight? ok?
yeah, the weight's ok.
all right, lemme ask you something. let's say i was a good friend of yours. and i was telling you i was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this janiro fight. what would you tell me?
i'd tell you to bet a bundle.
vickie?... vickie, you asleep?
what?
you asleep?
yeah.
huh?
yeah, what?
tell me, you think of anybody else when i'm making love to you?
nobody. i love you, remember?
then why'd you say that thing about tony janiro?
what did i say?
that he's got a pretty face.
i never noticed his face.
you sure you're not thinking of him right now?
positive.
you're the one who said he was good looking. you think he's good looking 'cause i know you think he's good- looking. i'll smash his face inside out. i'll make him into dog meat. nobody's gonna think he's good-looking when i get through with him. so you just go ahead and think about who you want.
what're you doin' with salvy? you shouldn't be here with him. jake's away killin' himself. suppose he found out.
what the hell am i doing wrong? just because jake is training, i can't go out? what am i, a goddamn prisoner?
no, you're his wife.
i'm not doing anything wrong. i'm just trying to have a good time. do i have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
it don't look right.
well, go ahead, tell jake. he's gonna kill me anyway. it's a matter of time.
i'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. what's the matter with you? aren't you happy? you got everything you want.
you don't sleep with him. i do. i don't get to breathe without tellin' him. he keeps me in a cage. if he thinks i'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, i get used as a punching bag. he don't trust nobody. if he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. look at me, joey. i'm 19 years old. i wanna enjoy my life. i love jake, but you don't know. he gets crazy sometimes. i'm scared.
try to understand, vickie. jake's got a lotta aggravation. he's been a top contender too long.
that's right, take his part. you're his brother. he's never gonna be champ. too many people are against him.
and you're drinking with them right now.
and i'm gonna finish my drink. and, i'm gonna have a good time, because i ain't doing nothing wrong.
i said, let's go.
joey, relax. you're taking this the wrong way. why don't you sit down and have a drink?
excuse me, i'm talking to my sister in-law.
excuse me for living.
what do you think, i'm blind? my brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
hey joey, i'm here with patsy and vera and sandy. and vickie just happened to come along. we're just trying to have a good time. what do you want from me? so, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
hey joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
i'll suck your eyes out! i'll fuckin' take the two of you.
all right. i don't have to hear any more. i think i understand what happened. i understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. i'm not sayin' salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. but, joey, you don't raise your hands. you don't do that kind of thing. this time we forget about it but no more after this. you understand?
yeah, i understand, tommy.
all right, you guys, shake hands.
aside from everything else, your family all right?
yeah, they're good. they're good, tommy.
what is it with you? can't you talk? you got like a funny attitude. i can't figure you out, joey. what's with you and the quick answers? you wanna get outa here fast?
aw, tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
look joey, i wanna tell you something. your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. and i'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
how can he embarrass you?
he's an embarrassment because frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and i'm lookin' very bad. i can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. why's he make it so hard on himself? he comes to me, i can make it easier for him.
tommy, jake respects you. he won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. but you know when jake gets set on somethin', jesus christ almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. i'm his kid brother. i got no say with jake on this. he thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
make it on his own? does he know the kind of money involved? i mean the real money. he thinks he's gonna become champ on his own? we're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? a nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody? is he really crazy? listen, joey, you understand, you tell him. i don't care how great he is or how colorful. he could beat all the sugar ray robinsons and all the janiros he wants to. he ain't gonna get a shot at the title without us. i'm not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head!
whatcha doin'?
i remember the first time i met vickie... i know there's somethin' up. i know she's doin' somethin', but i can't catch her...
maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
what do you mean?
try talkin' to her. she's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
when i'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? tell me the truth.
jack, if there was anything funny, i would tell you.
i want you to keep an eye on her when i'm not here. understand?
sure, i'll keep an eye on her.
what did tommy say?
i got good news, and i got bad news. the good news is you got your shot at the title. the bad news is...
yeah, i know.
what's up, colonel?
i'd like to talk to jake a minute.
what who's been sayin'?
you were a big favorite in this fight. then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
i don't follow no gamblin' commissioner. i'm just a fighter.
now the fight's off the books altogether. meyer lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. some people are saying you're going into the tank.
believe what you want.
i want to believe you, lamotta.
i'm gonna kill him. that fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. you got any money?
what?
you got any money you want to bet on billy fox, you can put it right here...  'cause jake lamotta don't go down for nobody.
don't fight anymore!  it's a free country, don't fight anymore!
why did they have to stop it? why did they have to stop it?
stick out your hands, jake.
c'mon, joey.
g'wan, do it.  protect yourself, rummy.
see? that's all there was to it.
what the fuck they want? i took the dive. they want me to fall down too? i don't fall down for nobody. i never went down in my life. joey, what do i gotta do? crawl on my hands and knees? i made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' garden! all the newspaper writers make fun of me. i'm the bum of the year. all i want is a shot. just a fuckin' shot. what do i gotta do? i'll do anything.
except fall down like a normal person.
yeah, except fall down. that's right.
all right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. so, you enjoy the suspension. 'cause there's nothin' you can do about it. let the commissioner and the d.a. jerk you around. so you wait.
jesus christ! seven months! what am i gonna do for seven months? i'm gonna go crazy. how do i keep my strength? by that time i'll be too weak to win the title. and my weight? forget about it -- i'm gonna blow up like a balloon. i ain't never gonna hold my weight down. seven months! i don't know...
we did what we had to do. tommy don't forget. sooner or later you'll get your shot -- if tommy don't die.
i'm gonna order up some stuff. have a steak.
i can't eat a steak. if i eat a steak, i'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
so eat just a little. you gotta eat something.
what am i gonna do for 24 hours? i can't even eat!
hey champ!
tommy, thanks for coming over.
you just take it easy, now. you'll do all right. feelin' ok?
i'm ok.
just come by to wish you luck.  need anything?
no, we're all right. thanks anyway, tommy.
ok, champ.
hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
what did i do?
you don't kiss like that. hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
all i did...
you know what i'm talking about. don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
you're hurting my arm.
but jake... i didn't say anything...
don't ever do that again. you don't  do it!
jake...
what's the matter with you?
tryin' to get this fuckin' tv to work. paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. and mr. wizard here ain't no help.
screw you, jack.
where you been?
i went out.
what's that kissing on the mouth shit?
what? i just said hello. since when i can't kiss my sister-in-law?
ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? i never even kissed mama on the mouth.
well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
well, that's what i mean.
how's that?
i can't tell. you're stomach's in the way.
answer me somethin'. what happened at the copa with salvy when i was out of town?
when?
you know, when you gave him a beatin'.
nothin'. salvy was out of line. he was drunk or somethin', i dunno. anyway, the windup was i gave him a beatin'. tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. it's all forgotten about.
why didn't you tell me about it?
it didn't have nothin' to do with you.
didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
no, i just told you what happened.
who did it have anything to do with... vickie?
jack, no. i just explained the whole thing to you. it was just between me and salvy, if it had anything to do with you and vickie, i woulda told you about it.
well, i heard some things.
whatever you touched, that's good now.
did salvy fuck vickie?
what?
you're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. i'm askin'...
i did keep an eye...
then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? you and him been friends a long time.
some things changed between us. now, he thinks who the fuck he is. he's been passing certain remarks that i don't like.
don't bullshit me, joey. you ain't tellin' me the truth.
what bullshit? hey, i'm your brother. you wanna believe me -- you trust me?
when it comes to her, i don't trust nobody. i'm askin' you somethin'.
well, you're wrong jack. i'm tellin" you what happened. he got outta line, we had a fight, and it's straightened out now.
you givin' me that look. i gotta accept your word, but if i find out anythin', i'm gonna kill somebody...
so, go ahead. kill everybody. kill salvy, kill vickie, kill tommy como, kill me while you're at it. what do i care? you're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
what do you mean, "you"?
what?
what do you mean, "you"?
i meant, kill everybody. you or me or anybody. you're a big shot. kill, kill... g'head.
but you said "you."
so what?
eh, joey, even you don't know what you meant. you mentioned salvy, tommy como, you -- that means somethin'. why'd you say them? you coulda said anybody.
you're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... you wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
did you ever fuck my wife?
what?
i don't mean now. i mean before -- before we met.
whadda ya mean?
did you ever fuck my wife?
whatsa matter with you?
you're very smart, joey, very smart. nobody gives me a straight answer around here. you're givin' me these answers, but you still didn't answer my question. did you fuck vickie?
i gotta go. i gotta get outta here. i can't take this shit. lenore is waitin' for me. i gotta go. you're a definite wacko. you're fuckin' crazy, you know that, crazy.

i got bored so i went to the movies.
what'd you see?
i went to the movies.
what'd you see?
"father of the bride."
what was it about?
oh, c'mon. for christsake, do i have to tell you everything?
did you ever go to the copa when i was away?
what're you talking about?
answer me when i talk to you. what happened that night?
i am answering...
what do i have to do to get a straight answer around here.
jake, no --
do i have to kill you, eh?  do i have to kill somebody to get an answer?  i know about you at the copa. i know all about it.
i didn't do anything wrong. i swear. i just had a few drinks.

you're a fuckin' liar.
i'll say anything you want me to say. i fuckled salvy. i fucked tommy. i fucked your brother. i fucked everybody! what do you want to hear? i sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
you did?
yeah, i sucked his cock.
was vickie part of the deal with tommy? was my wife part of the deal? tell me, was that it?
stop it. what're you, crazy?
you're killing him. you're killing him for nothing. stop it.
get the fuck outa here. whadda you mean nothing'? you stupid bitch!
nothing is what i said! go on, kill me.  kill me.  i'm not afraid of you anymore. i don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. you're a sick animal.
you're the fuckin' animal! you ran around with every guy i knew while i was breakin' my ass for you.
you're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal.  you're rotten.  rotten.  rotten.  you're a sick maniac. a maniac! you belong in a mental hospital.
you know, if there's one thing -- i just don't understand you, not one single little bit. you love me?
yeah --
it ain't worth it, jake. get out.
what time is it?
nine o'clock.
at night?
yeah. at night.
how many pounds i gotta lose?
three more, i figure.
just give me a chip of ice to put in my mouth. just a chip of ice.
i'll give you anything you want, jake. i think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
are you outa your mind? if i come out, i'll lose the title.
jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.
i don't know what it is. i dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
jake --
what?
i want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
ok. talk.
why don't you just call him up?
what do i say to him? call him up on the phone and say, "joey, i'm sorry about that little trouble we had. how about havin' dinner?" is that what i say?
no, not that.
then what?
i don't know.
i miss joey. i wish joey was here.
why don't you just call him?
i dunno.
tell him how you feel -- you miss him. tell him you're sorry.
ok, all right. telephone's in the hall. dial his number.
he ain't hurting me, but i can't get him down.
don't talk. keep at it. jab, jab, jab. you're ahead on points.
i'm pulling out of next wednesday's tv bout 'cause i can't make the weight. i'm fighting at light heavyweight, and i still can't make the weight.
does that mean...
it means i'm through with boxing. i'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. i'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
you sound bitter.
why should i be bitter? boxing's been good to me. i got a nice house, three kids, a beautiful wife -- take a picture of her. vickie.
ain't she beautiful? coulda been mrs. america if i didn't pull her outa the contest. didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.
what do you think of jake's retirement, mrs. lamotta?
j.r., glad you could make it.
you were great, jake. just like old times. good thing sugar ray wasn't here tonight. oh jake, this is state's attorney bronson and his wife.
you're a good sport, lady.
i saw you fight bob satterfield in '46, jake. in chicago. you were great.
yeah, i really cleaned up on him.
where's your wife, jake?
do you think i'd let her in a place like this with guys like you hangin' around?
i'm sorry. i had to work late last night. slept at the club.
i'm leaving you jake.
sure, what else is new?
no. this time it's true. i didn't bother to tell you until i had everything worked out.
open the door, vickie.
no. i won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
aw, c'mon. don't say that.
i got a lawyer, jake. we're getting a divorce. i'm getting custody of the kids.
aw, c'mon, vick --
i'm sick of it. i can't watch you this way. you're too drunk all the time. there's too many girls. i can't... i don't wanna talk about it. i made up my mind.
let's go, jake, wake up!
huh? whadda ya mean, get up?
we're from...
i know where you're from. you guys look the same every place.
they wanna talk to you.
about what?
i don't run the joint. they just told me to bring you in.
for what?
vickie, open up. i need to come in.
are you drunk?
no. open the door.
the kids are sleeping.
i promise i just gotta pick up one thing.
all right, just don't make any noise.
what are you doing?
i need ten thousand dollars. my lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
but they don't have a case against you.
are you kiddin'? did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? did you see the papers? "lamotta on vice rap." everybody likes a shot at the champ.
jake, be careful! what're you doing to the belt?!
don't make no difference no more.
can't you get the money from your friends?
what friends?
salvy, would i steer you wrong? let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
hey but joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. the money's with your brother.
what do you want from my life, salvy? he's my brother.
he ain't doin' the right thing. he's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. can't you make him understand that?
hey, leave the kids alone.
get lost.  hey kids, "a cop is a rat." remember that, "a rat."
this looks done.
it's not done.
it looks done. i'll take it the way it is.
here's your steak. you can't wait for it to be done. here.
here's your carrots. you're in such a hurry. you can't wait.
no, i can't wait. you know when i wait? when it's important to wait. it's not important to wait for no steak. it's important to wait for reeves to leave the ring. it ain't important to wait for no steak! i won that fight. so, i stayed in the ring, and that way i made sure everybody knew it. i shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
i can't convince him. he's got such a thick head, i'd like to crack it open myself. believe me, my own brother. it's very hard. you don't have to convince me -- i know we should be with tommy. you talk to him. he don't listen to nobody.
look, i'm just tellin' you how tommy feels. jake is makin' it hard on himself. tommy wants him with us. it's as simple as that.
talk some sense into him, will ya? you're still his brother. if he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
all right, i'll try. see you later.
tomorrow, at the gym. don't forget.
right, the gym.
what's wrong?
nothing...
hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
i ain't ever gonna fight joe louis, that's what's the matter.
what're you talking about? he's a heavyweight. you're a middleweight.
that's what i'm sayin'. you shouldn't even think like that. it's crazy.
i tell you one thing. ok, i'll never be big enough to fight louis, but i know joey, i know...
you know?
yeah. do me a favor.
sure. what is it?
hit me in the face.
you want me to do what?
you heard me, i said hit me.
c'mon, jack. you had a few drinks.
go ahead. i ain't drunk. take your best shot. on the jaw.
jack, i got no gloves.
here's your glove.
harder.  take the towel off.
jack! enough!
go ahead.
what was that for? i know you can take punches. i can hit you from now to doomsday. what the fuck does that prove?
see that, i don't feel it. i can take it. i know i can take anybody.
answer me when i talk to you.
yeah, yeah. they just wanted to talk to you. so i...
don't ever bring those kids up here again! i'm working out, i'm killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood.
and that hard-on, salvy. who's he think he is? i'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
what are you getting so hot about -- tommy como told him to come down here...
hey, i don't care about tommy como. i don't care about jesus christ on the fuckin' cross. i gotta give them a percentage of what i make! i'm in here breaking my ass, not them. don't ever bring them up here again.
i didn't tell them to come. tommy como...
who's that?
whadda you care?
whadda ya mean, whadda i care? who is she? what's a matter? you afraid i'm gonna take her on you?
no, i'm not afraid. why? you wanna meet her?
yeah --
cause i'll go right over there and bring her here.
go 'head.
you sure you wanna meet her? don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. she's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
how do you know? you know her that good?
no, i see her around the pool. i know her. i know her like that -- not like that.
nah, not now... i wanna wait. i don't feel right...
i'm tellin' you, she'll be there, i know she'll be there.
'cause i wanna catch her alone.
how you gonna catch anybody alone at a dance?... i don't know if she'll be there alone... she'll probably be there with her girlfriends or something.
she ever go with them? like salvy?
nah, she don't go with nobody. she's only 15 years old.
what does that have to do with it? she don't look 15 to me. i heard somethin' with salvy. she was with him once or somethin', i think. it was like some blonde. that's the one...
probably. you know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
yeah, she's nice.
ah, some piece of ass, i'm tellin' you.
you wasn't with her, were you?
huh?
you wasn't with her?
with her? how?
you know, like bang her or anything?
ah, no, no. i didn't bang her. i know her from around here, that's all. you want to meet her or what?
nah, not now -- all those hard-ons around. i'll wait. not now.
i'm tellin' you, she'll be there, i know she'll be there. dressed up and everything.
i don't like all those other clowns around. that's all i know.
c'mon, hurry up. we're never gonna get outa here tonight.
where you going at this hour?
what're you, a cop? i'm goin' out -- business.
you fuckin' worm, if you're going out, i'm going out.
and where you goin'?
none of your fuckin' business.
hey, watch your mouth. don't talk like that. she's still my wife.
no, but jake... how much abuse can you take.
how many times do i have to hit her? i hit her enough.
do you see her yet?
give me a chance. let me look.
joey said you wanted to meet me. is that right? you wanted to meet me?
i just wanted to say hello.
you wanted to say hello, eh? i can't believe it. when did you fall outa heaven? anyone ever tell you you're the most beautiful one here, princess of the pool. you got a baby face. look at mine. whatcha wanna meet me for?
i don't know. 'cause you're cute.
ya hear, joey? she thinks this face is cute? hey, whatcha doin' now? you wanna go for a ride?
you don't talk very much.
i ain't ever talked to a movie star before.
i ain't no movie star. i'm just in high school.
oh no? i thought you was a movie star.
you go first. let me watch how to do this.
you don't get nothin' done by watchin'. you just gotta do it. here, i'll help you.
that's it. just grip up a little tighter. that's it. you're gonna be real good at this. how does that feel?
it feels real good.
just keep your eye on the ball.
should i hit it?
just give it a nice little tap.
i can't find my ball.
can you see it?
can you see it?
no.
what does that mean?
jake, this is your father's bedroom.
that's all right. he don't mind.
jake...
it's ok.
i'm tellin' you now, when i read this, it better not make me look bad.
jake, did i ever make you look bad before?
maybe it wasn't you, but you know what i'm talkin' about.
why not? there's nobody else around who wants to fight me; they're all afraid. i don't see why i shouldn't have a shot at the title right now.
well, the word is to get a title shot you have to cooperate with the people who control boxing, in new york. and they're saying that you don't cooperate.
you guys know more about that than i do. i just fight...
he fights the toughest guys around that everybody else is afraid to fight...
i'm the only guy ever to beat sugar ray, and i still don't have a shot at the title.
you just fought sugar ray two weeks ago and you're training like this right now... are you afraid sugar ray might beat you this time?
i tell you what. you hit me here.  sugar ray hits me here.  i can't tell the difference. i just fight.
are you sure we should be doing this?
come over here.
you said never to touch you before a fight.
if you let me do it, i'll murder you. come here.
you said i couldn't. you've been good for two weeks...
come here.
take off my pants.
jake...
do what i say.
now take the rest off.
jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
go 'head. do it.
i like the gym smell.
now take your panties off.
now, touch me...  ...here.
oh, jake.
they robbed us! those fuckin' judges -- what the fuck fight were they watching? if i see them on the street, i'll break their heads. decision robinson, my fuckin' ass! those judges give him the decision 'cause he's goin in the army next week! how else could this have happened?... what do you think they gave him the decision for, that's why.
whadda i gotta do, joey? i knocked him down. what did i do wrong? i don't understand.
you won and was robbed! you didn't do nothin' wrong.
i dunno. maybe i don't deserve to win. i've done a lot of bad things. i dunno...
you want us to wait for you?
no, take her home. i wanna be alone for a while. everybody go.
i just weighed myself -- i'm 161. no more deals like this janiro bullshit. i didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! what did i do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! now i don't know if i can make it down to 155. i'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if i don't make 155, i forfeit $15,000! you're supposed to know what you're doin'. you're supposed to be a manager!
you want the title shot?
say what you're gonna say.
you want the title shot or not?
say what you gotta say. don't be a smart ass.
this janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. knockout this fuckin' kid! i'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. listen to me: i'm telling you. you been killin' yourself for three years. there's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. this janiro's up-and- coming. he don't know. fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! what are you worried about? your weight? look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. they'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. and if you beat this kid janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. all right?
joey's right. janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking...
what do you mean, "good looking?"
well, he's popular. a lotta people like janiro. you beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. but, what do i know? i should keep my mouth shut, i should...
who asked you?
but, jake, i was just...
who asked you?
i was just...
who asked you?
what're you lookin' at? you lookin' at him?
no, i'm not. i'm looking at you.
don't tell me "no." i saw you lookin' at him. why, you like him?
i'm not interested in him.
you're not interested in him?
no, i'm not.
in other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
jake, c'mon now. don't start.
look at this, all of a sudden everybody's a fuckin' romeo around here. did you see the way she was lookin' at him?
nah, she would never...
didn't you just see her lookin' at him? she told me no, but i don't believe her.
c'mon, jake. you know she's crazy about you.
excuse me for a minute. be right back.
don't be long. i'm afraid with all these tough guys here.
hi, tommy. how are you?
jake, sit down for a minute.
fuckin' kid! you're the best fuckin' fighter around. loved what you did to satterfield. them "moulan yans" -- forget about it. they're all afraid to fight you.
c'mon, tommy --
how you feelin'? ok? you feelin' good?
never felt better.
tony janiro's gotta watch out, eh?
he should.
this janiro's a good fighter, pretty good-lookin' kid.
how's the weight? ok?
yeah, the weight's ok.
all right, lemme ask you something. let's say i was a good friend of yours. and i was telling you i was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this janiro fight. what would you tell me?
i'd tell you to bet a bundle.
vickie?... vickie, you asleep?
what?
you asleep?
yeah.
huh?
yeah, what?
tell me, you think of anybody else when i'm making love to you?
nobody. i love you, remember?
then why'd you say that thing about tony janiro?
what did i say?
that he's got a pretty face.
i never noticed his face.
you sure you're not thinking of him right now?
positive.
you're the one who said he was good looking. you think he's good looking 'cause i know you think he's good- looking. i'll smash his face inside out. i'll make him into dog meat. nobody's gonna think he's good-looking when i get through with him. so you just go ahead and think about who you want.
what're you doin' with salvy? you shouldn't be here with him. jake's away killin' himself. suppose he found out.
what the hell am i doing wrong? just because jake is training, i can't go out? what am i, a goddamn prisoner?
no, you're his wife.
i'm not doing anything wrong. i'm just trying to have a good time. do i have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
it don't look right.
well, go ahead, tell jake. he's gonna kill me anyway. it's a matter of time.
i'm not gonna tell him nothing; but if he finds out, he will kill you. what's the matter with you? aren't you happy? you got everything you want.
you don't sleep with him. i do. i don't get to breathe without tellin' him. he keeps me in a cage. if he thinks i'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, i get used as a punching bag. he don't trust nobody. if he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. look at me, joey. i'm 19 years old. i wanna enjoy my life. i love jake, but you don't know. he gets crazy sometimes. i'm scared.
try to understand, vickie. jake's got a lotta aggravation. he's been a top contender too long.
that's right, take his part. you're his brother. he's never gonna be champ. too many people are against him.
and you're drinking with them right now.
and i'm gonna finish my drink. and, i'm gonna have a good time, because i ain't doing nothing wrong.
i said, let's go.
joey, relax. you're taking this the wrong way. why don't you sit down and have a drink?
excuse me, i'm talking to my sister in-law.
excuse me for living.
what do you think, i'm blind? my brother's breaking his ass in a ring, and you're here with his wife.
hey joey, i'm here with patsy and vera and sandy. and vickie just happened to come along. we're just trying to have a good time. what do you want from me? so, why don't you just take it easy before this gets out of hand.
hey joey, whadda ya lookin' to die young?
i'll suck your eyes out! i'll fuckin' take the two of you.
all right. i don't have to hear any more. i think i understand what happened. i understand it was your brother's wife and there was probably a misunderstanding. i'm not sayin' salvy shouldn't have acted the way he did. but, joey, you don't raise your hands. you don't do that kind of thing. this time we forget about it but no more after this. you understand?
yeah, i understand, tommy.
all right, you guys, shake hands.
aside from everything else, your family all right?
yeah, they're good. they're good, tommy.
what is it with you? can't you talk? you got like a funny attitude. i can't figure you out, joey. what's with you and the quick answers? you wanna get outa here fast?
aw, tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
look joey, i wanna tell you something. your brother ain't gonna get nowhere without us -- nowhere. and i'm tellin' you between the two of us, it's gettin' to the point where it's gettin' to be a real embarrassment to me, a real embarrassment.
how can he embarrass you?
he's an embarrassment because frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and i'm lookin' very bad. i can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. why's he make it so hard on himself? he comes to me, i can make it easier for him.
tommy, jake respects you. he won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. but you know when jake gets set on somethin', jesus christ almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. i'm his kid brother. i got no say with jake on this. he thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
make it on his own? does he know the kind of money involved? i mean the real money. he thinks he's gonna become champ on his own? we're gonna sit by and see some nut come in there and hold one of the most important titles in the world? a nut who don't listen to nobody or respect nobody? is he really crazy? listen, joey, you understand, you tell him. i don't care how great he is or how colorful. he could beat all the sugar ray robinsons and all the janiros he wants to. he ain't gonna get a shot at the title without us. i'm not askin' you to do another thing except get that message into that thick head!
whatcha doin'?
i remember the first time i met vickie... i know there's somethin' up. i know she's doin' somethin', but i can't catch her...
maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
what do you mean?
try talkin' to her. she's your wife -- ask her what's the matter.
when i'm away, did you ever notice anythin' funny with her? tell me the truth.
jack, if there was anything funny, i would tell you.
i want you to keep an eye on her when i'm not here. understand?
sure, i'll keep an eye on her.
what did tommy say?
i got good news, and i got bad news. the good news is you got your shot at the title. the bad news is...
yeah, i know.
what's up, colonel?
i'd like to talk to jake a minute.
what who's been sayin'?
you were a big favorite in this fight. then two days ago the odds start jumping all over the place until you're a 12-5 underdog.
i don't follow no gamblin' commissioner. i'm just a fighter.
now the fight's off the books altogether. meyer lansky couldn't get a bet down on this fight. some people are saying you're going into the tank.
believe what you want.
i want to believe you, lamotta.
i'm gonna kill him. that fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. you got any money?
what?
you got any money you want to bet on billy fox, you can put it right here...  'cause jake lamotta don't go down for nobody.
don't fight anymore!  it's a free country, don't fight anymore!
why did they have to stop it? why did they have to stop it?
stick out your hands, jake.
c'mon, joey.
g'wan, do it.  protect yourself, rummy.
see? that's all there was to it.
what the fuck they want? i took the dive. they want me to fall down too? i don't fall down for nobody. i never went down in my life. joey, what do i gotta do? crawl on my hands and knees? i made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' garden! all the newspaper writers make fun of me. i'm the bum of the year. all i want is a shot. just a fuckin' shot. what do i gotta do? i'll do anything.
except fall down like a normal person.
yeah, except fall down. that's right.
all right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. so, you enjoy the suspension. 'cause there's nothin' you can do about it. let the commissioner and the d.a. jerk you around. so you wait.
jesus christ! seven months! what am i gonna do for seven months? i'm gonna go crazy. how do i keep my strength? by that time i'll be too weak to win the title. and my weight? forget about it -- i'm gonna blow up like a balloon. i ain't never gonna hold my weight down. seven months! i don't know...
we did what we had to do. tommy don't forget. sooner or later you'll get your shot -- if tommy don't die.
i'm gonna order up some stuff. have a steak.
i can't eat a steak. if i eat a steak, i'm gonna have trouble making the weigh-in.
so eat just a little. you gotta eat something.
what am i gonna do for 24 hours? i can't even eat!
hey champ!
tommy, thanks for coming over.
you just take it easy, now. you'll do all right. feelin' ok?
i'm ok.
just come by to wish you luck.  need anything?
no, we're all right. thanks anyway, tommy.
ok, champ.
hey, you don't say goodbye to him like that.
what did i do?
you don't kiss like that. hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
all i did...
you know what i'm talking about. don't ever make me look bad on the night of my big fight.
you're hurting my arm.
but jake... i didn't say anything...
don't ever do that again. you don't  do it!
jake...
what's the matter with you?
tryin' to get this fuckin' tv to work. paid all this money for it and still can't get a station a mile away. and mr. wizard here ain't no help.
screw you, jack.
where you been?
i went out.
what's that kissing on the mouth shit?
what? i just said hello. since when i can't kiss my sister-in-law?
ain't a cheek ever good enough for you? i never even kissed mama on the mouth.
well, you're not supposed to kiss your mother on the mouth.
well, that's what i mean.
how's that?
i can't tell. you're stomach's in the way.
answer me somethin'. what happened at the copa with salvy when i was out of town?
when?
you know, when you gave him a beatin'.
nothin'. salvy was out of line. he was drunk or somethin', i dunno. anyway, the windup was i gave him a beatin'. tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. it's all forgotten about.
why didn't you tell me about it?
it didn't have nothin' to do with you.
didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
no, i just told you what happened.
who did it have anything to do with... vickie?
jack, no. i just explained the whole thing to you. it was just between me and salvy, if it had anything to do with you and vickie, i woulda told you about it.
well, i heard some things.
whatever you touched, that's good now.
did salvy fuck vickie?
what?
you're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. i'm askin'...
i did keep an eye...
then why did you give him a beatin' if he didn't do anything? you and him been friends a long time.
some things changed between us. now, he thinks who the fuck he is. he's been passing certain remarks that i don't like.
don't bullshit me, joey. you ain't tellin' me the truth.
what bullshit? hey, i'm your brother. you wanna believe me -- you trust me?
when it comes to her, i don't trust nobody. i'm askin' you somethin'.
well, you're wrong jack. i'm tellin" you what happened. he got outta line, we had a fight, and it's straightened out now.
you givin' me that look. i gotta accept your word, but if i find out anythin', i'm gonna kill somebody...
so, go ahead. kill everybody. kill salvy, kill vickie, kill tommy como, kill me while you're at it. what do i care? you're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
what do you mean, "you"?
what?
what do you mean, "you"?
i meant, kill everybody. you or me or anybody. you're a big shot. kill, kill... g'head.
but you said "you."
so what?
eh, joey, even you don't know what you meant. you mentioned salvy, tommy como, you -- that means somethin'. why'd you say them? you coulda said anybody.
you're worried about this girl, you're gonna let this girl ruin you're life for you... you wanna worry, worry about your fuckin' stomach that you can't bend over -- that you gotta step in the ring in a month.
did you ever fuck my wife?
what?
i don't mean now. i mean before -- before we met.
whadda ya mean?
did you ever fuck my wife?

i'll give you anything you want, jake. i think you should come out for a few minutes -- give yourself a break.
are you outa your mind? if i come out, i'll lose the title.
jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.
i don't know what it is. i dunno, it's the kind of thing that -- the words won't come out.
jake --
what?
i want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
ok. talk.
why don't you just call him up?
what do i say to him? call him up on the phone and say, "joey, i'm sorry about that little trouble we had. how about havin' dinner?" is that what i say?
no, not that.
then what?
i don't know.
i miss joey. i wish joey was here.
why don't you just call him?
i dunno.
tell him how you feel -- you miss him. tell him you're sorry.
ok, all right. telephone's in the hall. dial his number.
he ain't hurting me, but i can't get him down.
don't talk. keep at it. jab, jab, jab. you're ahead on points.
i'm pulling out of next wednesday's tv bout 'cause i can't make the weight. i'm fighting at light heavyweight, and i still can't make the weight.
does that mean...
it means i'm through with boxing. i'm tired with tryin' to make the weight anymore. i'm sick of thinkin' about weight, weight, weight.
you sound bitter.
why should i be bitter? boxing's been good to me. i got a nice house, three kids, a beautiful wife -- take a picture of her. vickie.
ain't she beautiful? coulda been mrs. america if i didn't pull her outa the contest. didn't want her wearing a swimsuit for nobody but me.
what do you think of jake's retirement, mrs. lamotta?
j.r., glad you could make it.
you were great, jake. just like old times. good thing sugar ray wasn't here tonight. oh jake, this is state's attorney bronson and his wife.
you're a good sport, lady.
i saw you fight bob satterfield in '46, jake. in chicago. you were great.
yeah, i really cleaned up on him.
where's your wife, jake?
do you think i'd let her in a place like this with guys like you hangin' around?
i'm sorry. i had to work late last night. slept at the club.
i'm leaving you jake.
sure, what else is new?
no. this time it's true. i didn't bother to tell you until i had everything worked out.
open the door, vickie.
no. i won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
aw, c'mon. don't say that.
i got a lawyer, jake. we're getting a divorce. i'm getting custody of the kids.
aw, c'mon, vick --
i'm sick of it. i can't watch you this way. you're too drunk all the time. there's too many girls. i can't... i don't wanna talk about it. i made up my mind.
let's go, jake, wake up!
huh? whadda ya mean, get up?
we're from...
i know where you're from. you guys look the same every place.
they wanna talk to you.
about what?
i don't run the joint. they just told me to bring you in.
for what?
vickie, open up. i need to come in.
are you drunk?
no. open the door.
the kids are sleeping.
i promise i just gotta pick up one thing.
all right, just don't make any noise.
what are you doing?
i need ten thousand dollars. my lawyer says if we can spread ten thousand bucks around, we can get the case dropped.
but they don't have a case against you.
are you kiddin'? did you ever see a 14-year-old testify in court? did you see the papers? "lamotta on vice rap." everybody likes a shot at the champ.
jake, be careful! what're you doing to the belt?!
don't make no difference no more.
can't you get the money from your friends?
what friends?
