you know less than nothing.  if you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
yes, sir.
eating solid breakfasts, utah?
sir?
all the food groups?  avoiding sugar?  caffeine?  i see to it that my people maintain cardiovascular fitness.  we stay off hard liquor, cigarettes...
i take the skin off chicken.
this is us.  bank robbery.  and you're in the bank-robbery capital of the world--
1322 last year in la county.  up 26 percent from the year before.
that's right.  and we nailed over a thousand of them.  we did it by crunching data.  good crime-scene work, good lab work, good data-base analysis.  nobody had to tackle a car once.  you getting the signal, special agent?
zero distortion, sir.
you're a real blue-flame special, aren't you, utah?  i don't know why they sent you to la.  must be an asshole shortage.
not so far.
added to which indignity, i got three months left to retirement and they saddle me with some blue-flamer fresh out of quantico for a partner. some quarterback punk, johnny unitas or something.
the shit they pull, huh?
pappas.  angelo pappas.
punk.  quarterback punk.
welcome to sea world, kid.
good move.
yeah, they control the room well. stick strictly to the cash drawers.
they don't go for the vault?
never go for the vault.  they never get greedy.
smart.  you burn time in the vault.
reagan usually drives.  stolen switch car, they leave it running at the curb, looks parked from a distance.  when they run, they dump the vehicle and vanish.  and i mean vanish.
surgical.  look at them separate the dye packs.  dick and ronny know their jobs.
the ex-presidents are the best i've seen, kid.
they found the drop car up on mulholland.  i want you two to go work it.
what?  now i'm working the drop car? who's handling the scene here?
cole and munoz.  i'm uh... letting them run with the ball for a while.
cole and munoz?  i been on this case for two years.
that's the point, isn't it?
yeah, i get it.  time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, harp?
supervising special agent, harp. now i want you to go work the drop car, okay, angelo?  okay?
you through, mr. wizard?  let me know if you find jimmy hoffa under the seat while you're at it.  hell, it's only 7:30.  the night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.
well, what're your ideas on these guys?
forget about it, kid.  they're ghosts.  let the goddamn yuppie mormon affirmative action assholes handle it.  see i'm almost 55... so i must be senile, right?  they better get me out before i start pissing myself in public.  drooling. it would look bad for the bureau, right?
so you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.
you watch your fucking mouth!  mr. hoover himself pinned the seal of honor right here!
sorry.
yeah.  that was thirty years ago anyway.  l.a.'s changed a lot since then. the air got dirty and the sex got clean.  so you want to nail the ex- presidents?  be a big hero?
yeah.  what's your theory?
the fucking punks are surfers.
oh well he must be a surfer.
shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... so last year nixon scuffs a counter going over. there was a soil sample.  non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  so i became a wax expert.  there's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
candle wax.  car wax.  mustache wax? could be anything.  guy's waxing his mustache at the beach.  gets sand in it.  wipes it off with a shoe.  shoe scuffs the counter.
the lab made three possible matches, this was one of 'em.
sex wax?  you're not into kinky shit, are you angelo?
surfers use it on their boards. they rub sand into it for traction.
thanks for the tip.  i needed this knowledge.
... four months.  june to october. mmmm...same the year before.
another month and we don't see 'em again 'til next summer.
johnny, it's the only way.
why can't i just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  ask a few questions.
they're like some kind of tribe. got their own language.  you can't just walk up to these guys.  you've got to get out there.  learn some moves.  get into their head.  pick up the speech.
angelo, this stuff is for little rubber people who don't shave yet.
it's all balance, right?  and coordination.  how hard can it be?
i think you gotta hit them straight on!
got it...
well, i saw you and--
yeah, you saw me and you figured that if a mere girl can do it, a big strong stud like you shouldn't have any problem.  right?!  well you figured wrong, dork!
hey!  uh, how do i get back in?
carefully, tough guy.  very carefully.
my name's johnny utah!
who cares!
i'm telling you so when you look back on this moment, you can think... there was this guy named utah and he was pretty much a dork but maybe not such a bad person and i let him drown in conditions he had no business being in whatsoever... when i could have easily helped him.
bye.
wait!  jesus christ!  you're fucking crazy, you know that? you go in there you're gonna eat it on the rocks.  here, follow me.
what do you want?
shrimp and fries.
i mean, what do you want?  what are you doing hanging around here.
i need you to teach me.
gimme a break.  one shrimp and fries to go!  anything to drink?
i'm serious.
i can see that.  but forget it. stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at.  miniature golf.  here, your number's 37.
well, i'm just gonna go back out there till i catch on to it or break my neck.
what is it?  you all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? this is a line, right?
no, no.  see, all my life i've done things for other people.  in high school i played football because my old man expected me to.  then my parents always figured i'd go to law school, so i did.  football scholarship.  graduated phi beta kappa--
this gonna take long?
wait, so i'm a big hero to my folks, right?  but two years ago they got killed in a car wreck and i just suddenly realized all my goals had been their goals.  and i hadn't been living my own life.  so i wanted something for myself.  something that maybe didn't make any sense.  you know what i mean?
i came out here from ohio a month ago.  never saw the ocean before.  i didn't think it would effect me so much.  like i'm drawn to it, or something.  i want to do what you do.  it's the truth.
tomorrow, 6 am.  here.  if you're a minute late i'm gone.  and stud... i didn't take you to raise.  i can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. that'll be four fifty.
stop here.  do you agree to do exactly what i say when i say it?
sure.
something happened.  you got nuked in the last quarter.
yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
and that's why you never went pro?
two years of surgery.  i missed my window.  limped through law school instead.
mmm.  a lawyer, huh?  too bad.  but at least you're surfing now.  so your life's not over yet, right?
not yet.
how was the beach?
fine.
surf conditions okay?
a little mushy.
a little mushy!  you think the taxpayers would like it, utah, if they knew they were paying a federal agent to surf and pick up girls?
babes.
what?
the correct term is babes, sir.  uh, this type of undercover operation is entirely dependent on picking up the idiom of the speech.  otherwise penetration is not possible, sir. of the social infrastructure, i mean.
special agent utah, this is not some job flippin' burgers at the drive-in. yes, the surfboard bothers me.  yes, your approach to this case bothers me.  and yes, you bother me.  you two have produced squat in the last two weeks, during which time the ex- presidents have robbed two more banks!!  do you have anything even remotely interesting to tell me?
caught my first tube this morning.
what, you couldn't have just left the thing in your car?
it sticks out, so i can't lock it. look, angelo, you think i joined the fbi to learn to surf?  this was your lame-o idea in the first place.  you gotta back me up on this.
johnny, all i can say is we better come up with something real soon.
angelo, pay attention.  there's gonna be a test afterward.  lab is showing traces of toxins.  pcbs. heavy elements... selenium, titanium and arsenic.
guy's the toxic avenger.
the beaches are always being closed because of waste spills, right?  and surfers are territorial.  they stick mostly to certain breaks.  if we can get some hair samples, and get a match to a certain beach, we'd know which break the ex-presidents surf. you buyin' this?
no.  but let's do it, anyway.  it's gonna bug the shit out of harp.
big zippo so far.  how about you?
patience hotshot.  patience.  it'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
no, but there are four guys back there you might check out.
thanks, buddy.
friends of yours, huh?
the one you decked is bunker wiess. the big one is his brother, warchild.  the other two always hang.  they think they're some kinda death squad around here.
what's their program?
they're punks.  nazis.  their brains are wired wrong.  they hurt surfing because they give nothing back, and they have no respect for the sea. they just want to get radical.  it's mindless aggression.  they'll never get it, the spiritual side of it.
you always talk like this?  you're not gonna start chanting or anything are you?
no.  so i was up the beach.  i saw it going down.  you didn't hesitate... they never backed you up an inch. that's rare in this world.
thanks for stepping in.
de nada.
gonna be some people at my house tonight.  maybe you can make it.
where?
come with tyler.  she knows.
look, if you're gonna go leavin' your piece and your shield in the car, you can damn well stay in sight.  okay?
okay, dad.
... felony b and e, three months in juvey.  better.  felony assault. postgraduate work at chino. excellent.  i'm lovin' it.  what about the brother?  great!  another model citizen. these guys really fit the profile.
remember, all bank robbers are losers, but not all losers are bank robbers.
when did harp say they'd have the warrant?
he's pushing it through first thing. you better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
nice place.
he rents it for the summer.  bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  most a these guys can't keep a job.  when the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
don't you gamble?
only make bets i can't afford to lose.  only way to be 100% committed.
who's the girl?
catch of the day.
oh, oh.  that sounds personal.
people are expendable to bodhi.
meaning you were expendable.
we went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  but you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
sure, he's "the bodhisattva".
yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something.  maybe he has.  you've seen him surf... that frenzy.  it seems like anger.  it's not.  it's the energy of lovemaking.  the sea is the woman in his life.  she's his only true lover.
so what's the biggest?  waimea?
no, bells beach, australia.
bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. i hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of bodhi's moonies.
what are you talking about?
i've seen that kamikaze look, johnny.  you've got it.  and bodhi can smell it a mile away.  he'll take you to the edge... and past it.  hey, bodhi.
what's goin' on?
swell's here, johnny.  bodhi always knows.
i can barely do this in broad daylight.
come on.  at least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
i gotta be fucking crazy.
yeah, but are you crazy enough?
football's a man-made game.  you keep score with numbers.  but in this, there's no field, no rules, no opponent.  just you and the wave.
i know that part.  tell me something i can use, here.
i've watched you once or twice.  you surf like it's some kind of street fight.  you jerk along from moment to moment, fighting everything that comes at you.  always trying to win.
a flaw i'm working on.
the only way to win out here is to surrender.  you have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
you had enough?
yeah.  i just want to sit out here for a minute.
look at you.
what?
well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... i don't know, like something's driving you.  see, it's gone.  if i didn't know better i'd say you looked almost happy.
i... i don't know.  i can't describe what i'm feeling.
you don't have to.
those are cold.
warm them up.
did that worthless punk partner of mine ever show up?
right here, partner.
i'm ready to rock, angelo.  where you want me?
cole and munoz are going in the back door.  babbit is backing me.  so i want you at the side window by the hedge.  you're strictly backup, got it?
got it.
awright.  get into position.  i'm rolling.
yeah?  what?
have you seen a little dog?  kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  about this big.
no.
you sure he isn't out back?  you mind if i go take a look?
look, i don't know anything about your dog, okay--
well is there anyone else here that might have seen him?
there's nobody else here...
aw shit.
nice tattoo, dietz.
i... i gotta go.
johnny... what's going on?  i don't get it... did i do something?
no.  i'm sorry.  i have to go. i'll, uh... i'll call you later. i'm sorry.
johnny!  uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  hey, where the hell were you all day?  you gotta at least call in or something.  you okay?
angelo, we gotta talk.
... so i started tailing him.
this zen master surfer.
bodhi, yeah.  i'm on him all day, right.  he goes here, he goes there, he goes to tower records and buys come cds, he has lunch at patrick's road house...  ... he goes into the assured trust savings and loan.
did he rob it?
cute.  he was inside for about 20 minutes.  the other guy, roach, waited in the truck.  they were scoping it out, right?!
yeah, or cashing a check.
wait, wait.  then these guys go back to their beach house and box up all their shit.  load it in bodhi's truck and take it to a public storage unit.  you see?  summer's almost over.  they're splitting. they're gonna pick up a little traveling money tomorrow.  the next day at the outside latest.  i got a feeling.
last time you got a feeling i had to kill a man, which i always hate because it looks bad on the report.
angelo... i'm right this time.  we can still win this one.
they're on their way to maui.
no way.  not yet.  come on.
i say we call it in.  get some backup.  but you gotta do it.  harp won't listen to me.
sure.  no problem.  i'll just call up and tell him his favorite agent saw this one surfer moon another surfer yesterday and it looked real suspicious.  shit, he'll probably call out the national guard.
i say we don't call it in.  under no circumstance are we to call this in.
look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  we cover the bank, whatever.  you and me.  that way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... i don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
time for lunch.
angelo, it's eleven thirty.
that place up the street has meatball sandwiches.  get me two.
the hell are they?!
they took a left at the next light!
you sure?!
nothing?
nothing.
ouch.
betadyne doesn't hurt.
you're kneeling on my hand.
so what'd the other guy look like?
never saw him, was your basic hit and run.
but you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?
jesus christ, johnny -- you've been using me!  your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... oh god, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
tyler, put the gun down.
you tell me the fucking truth johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash?  did they?!
i work bank robbery.  guys i'm after are surfers.  i needed you, at first, but not--
fuck you, johnny utah.  fuck you!! don't you have a soul?  goddamn you to hell!
how you figure?
news, last night... those guys, the ex-presidents... they robbed my bank yesterday.  and i was just there the day before, cashing a check.  see... look.  assured trust... same place.
one shot stopping.
'one shot stopping'... good, very good.  i like you, johnny.  i like you because you'll sacrifice anything to win.  i respect that. it elevates you a little above the drones who have learned compromise. here, hold it.  check out the weight.
ever done this before?
once.
pure adrenalin, right?!  the ultimate rush.  other guys snort for it, jab a vein for it -- all you gotta do is jump.
sure, it's a blast, but listen, i sorta screwed up my knee yesterday--
yeah, i noticed you limping.  but don't worry about it, brah. don't worry at all.  we're not gonna land on land!
it's a little ceremony we always have at the end of summer.  one last speedstar.
so, who... uh, who packed my chute?
i did.  what's the matter?  don't trust me?
you gotta earn trust.
then we'll earn it together.  here, take mine.
we gonna jump or jerk off?
my man!
utah, you copy bruddah?
whoooaaah!  shhiiittt!  whoooaaah!
i'll take that as a yes.
you gonna pull?
after you, alfonse.  i insist!
don't screw around man, pull it!
you do it... you first!
one thousand feet.  pull the goddamn cord!
you first!
okay!
what's this?
insurance policy.  now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  press play.
you're a fucking dead man--
whoa, whoa!!  think it through!  i'm the only one knows where they are. just let me talk for a second.
talk.
she'll be fine, rosie won't do anything.  at least not as long as i meet him at a certain place and time, about... let's see...  ... six hours from now.
you call him... right now... and tell him to let her go.
sorry, can't do it, brah.  he's on the road.  and where they're going there's no phones.  damn, i hate this johnny, i really do.  i hate violence.  see, that's why i need rosie.  i could never make this thing work, myself.  no way i could hold a knife to tyler's throat, man! she was my woman, once.  we shared time in this world.  but rosie, he's kind of a... mechanism.  once you set him in motion, he won't stop. that's his gift, a kind of... blankness.  noon comes, straight up, he'll gut her like a pig and try not to get any on his shoes.  nothing i can do, unless i get there.
we're wasting time.
see!  that's what i like about you, man!  you're just sharp as a razor blade.
i can't do this.
sure you can!  you may even like it... it's a killer rush.  you'll see.  hey, don't i show you things, johnny u?
bodhi, this is your wake up call, man -- i... am... an... eff... bee... eye... agent!!
wild, ain't it?!  see, we exist on a higher plane, you and i.  we make our own rules.  why be a servant of the law johnny u... when you can be it's master?
three men dead.  one of them a cop. how's that sit in your gut, utah?
take your hand off my shoulder right now.
look, harp.  don't turn him over to the uniforms like some punk.  let me ride him in.
yeah, sure.  why not?  you two screw-ups deserve each other. that's why i put you together in the first place.  christ pappas, you're as bad as he is... talk about the blind leading the blind--
harp, let me tell you something.  i was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing i learned in all those years that you still haven't?
what that?
i know where they're going.
figured you did.
i'm not armed.
but you're not alone.
good guess.  there's a gun on you right now.
where's roach?
around somewhere.  listen, i'm in kind of a hurry, johnny u.  what can i do for you?
you gotta tell me where she is.
and let my policy expire?  sorry.
look, bodhi man.  people are dead. the ride is over.
i say when it's over!
the guy you killed was an off duty cop!  if you get out of here they'll nail you wherever you land.  they have a new thing called radar. maybe you've heard of it.
angelo!  don't fire!
kid, get outta the way!!
nooo!!
why should i?
what if your chute fails, bodhi? rescind the order.  let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  do it, man, you owe me that much.  let me hear it before you check out.
pretty radical, johnny.  even for you.  why don't you pull it?
no games, bodhi.  pull the cord! now!!
naw, you pull it!
go on, johnny.  pull it.  but you gotta drop the gun, first!  right?! you use your other hand what you gonna hold on with?
pull it right now or i'll blow your fucking head off and pull it myself!
well that's the only way it's gonna happen, man.  do it!  come on, you want to do it.  you're gonna die, johnny.  five more seconds.  four...
three seconds... two... one...
shit!!
wild ride, huh?
jesus christ, bodhi!
and i always knew i could count on you, agent utah.
i'm not fbi anymore.
you never were...
i asked them to give me a couple minutes...
