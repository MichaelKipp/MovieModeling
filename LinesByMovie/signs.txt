i think it's contaminated.
you don't even know what that word means.
it's not contaminated. it's just tap water. pour it in his bowl.
it tastes funny.
he licks his butt everyday. he's not going to mind.
it's the strangest thing father.
don't call me father.
what's that?
don't call me father. it's just graham now.
sorry.
you said something was strange. what's strange?
the footprints.
what about them?
there are none.
it's not broken.
what kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
second thing this week i can't explain.
what was the first thing?
some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. sometimes violent behavior. theo henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
sounds like a virus.
no father, they're edgy. on alert. like they act when they smell a predator around... peeing on themselves and everything.
houdini's sick.
please tie up isabelle to the back of the shed. make sure the knot's tight.
what's the matter?
i saw a monster. can i have a glass of water?
what's wrong with the water next to your bed?
it tastes old.
what's the rule about getting up in the middle of the night?
only for pee or poop.
right.
what are you thinking about?
why do you talk to mom when you're by yourself?
it makes me feel better.
does she ever answer back?
no.
she doesn't answer me either.
okay, this guy is trying to scare us. he's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. it's time for an ass whoopin'!
this is not an intelligent way to approach this.
explain, act crazy?
curse and stuff.
i'm not going to curse.
you don't mean it. it's just for show.
it doesn't sound natural when i curse.
just make noises then.
explain noises.
are you going to do this or what?
no i'm not.
you want him coming in the house next time?
i cursed.
i heard.
it was very dark.
yes it was.
you can't describe him at all? don't you think that's find of odd?
it does seem kind of odd doesn't it?
i don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
he definitely wasn't a midget.
okay.  so he was tall?
i would say so.
it was very dark.
yes, it was.
let me ask you two something. don't be embarrassed by the answer. it is possible... just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? you said you went in opposite directions.
edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. but we couldn't see him. he stayed mostly in the shadows. all we could make out was movement.  but i'll tell you something with absolute certainty. there was someone watching our house last night. he was looking in my children's windows and i want you to find him edgar.  i need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.
can i use bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
yes.
it needs batteries.
edgar, come inside.
these are d's; i need double a's.
i have some upstairs.
this guy got on the roof in like a second.
bo, can you turn down the volume until officer paski leaves?
that roof is over ten feet high.
he's telling you the truth, edgar. whoever it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.
there's dust in it.
this one?
a hair.
this one?
morgan took a sip. it has his amoebas in it.
i don't think so.
do you owe anybody money? you can tell me off the record if you need too.
no.
is anything missing?
no.
it's still making the noises. it's broken.
it's old morgan.
but i'll tell you something, what i said in their, still goes. you and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
six months.
and three weeks.
it's left its mark still. the last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. take them into town. get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. it's good medicine.
it's good advice...  say hi to marcia for me.
you take care of yourself...  graham.
you do?
i've had two separate folks tell me they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of nights. can't tell what they look like, cause they're staying in the shadows -- covert like. no one's got hurt mind you... and that's the give away.
i see.
it's called probing. it's a military procedure. you send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out things. not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. evaluate the level of danger. make sure things are all clear...
clear for what?
i got the bat at home... on the wall.
you got two minor league home run records don't you?
five. the five longest.
boy, why aren't you in the pros making stacks of cash and getting handfuls of t and a?
pharmacy crowded?
i don't want any one of you spending time with tracey abernathy alone. is that understood?
is that him?
yeah.
it's noise.
it's broken morgan. it'll just keep doing this.  let's get out of the car okay?
we might lose the signal.
we can't just sit in the car in our own driveway like this.
i'm getting out now.
don't do it.
not english though. you heard the voices right uncle merrill?
i heard them morgan.
it's probably picking up another baby monitor.
that's right.
see this is why we're not watching those news reports. people get obsessed.  i'm letting go now.
no dad!
don't do it!
you'll lose the signal!
morgan?
it gets clearer, the higher you hold it.
morgan, be careful.
i got him.
listen bo. this is very important. everything people have written about in science books is going to change. the history of the world's future is on the tv right now. we need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  for your children bo.
my ballet recital.
dad!
do you think it's a possibility?
yes.
how can you say that?
that wasn't the answer you wanted?
can you at least pretend to be like you used to be? give me some comfort?
do you feel comforted?
yes.
what does it matter then?
for the kids protection. all they were doing was watching tv from five a.m. i felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. they should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
what's furry, furry rabbit?
that's a game isn't it?  anyway...  there's been some interesting developments.
what time is it?
eleven a.m. they're gone.
they caught it on tape and they've been playing it all morning. they found the bird. his head crushed in. when you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.  they think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical illusion.
the bird could have had a heart attack and crushed his head when he fell.
already thought of. two other birds did the same thing an hour later. not as dramatic. they lived. but you could see they hit something.
so the aliens can't read our minds.
oh.
they tell you everything in this book.
it says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. it says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
who wrote this book?
scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
that means they're unemployed.
dr. bimboo, one of the authors of the book --
bimboo?
dad.
i just asked his name.
the same windows.
that's weird.
where are you going?
ray reddy's house.
i don't want you to die.
who said i was going to die?
tell me something morgan. in that book of your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were hostile?
yes. they would invade us using only ground tactics. hand to hand combat. they wouldn't use their technology or fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.
i'm sorry, what book is this?
did they say what our chances would be if they did invade?
they said one of two things could happen. one, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.
what's two?
they win.
what do you think about the idea that they don't like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake or something?
sounds made up.
they think these look like stages immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.
it's like war of the worlds.
they think it might happen all at once.
some guy had a sign that said it was the end of the world.  nothing really bad is going to happen, is it uncle merrill?
don't worry.
we'll have to board up the bedroom doors.
where are we going to sleep?
the family room.
what about isabelle?
we'll keep her in the garage, after dinner.
french toast... and mashed potatoes.
now we're talking.  how about you merrill?
chicken teriyaki.
good choice... i'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  extra bacon.
i'm scared.
me too.
stop crying!
don't yell at her!
should we turn off the lights?
they already know we're here.
they're on the roof.
while they were trying to fix her up, all she kept asking about was you.
this is going to do nothing.
we have to go in the basement.
did i ever tell you, i dislocated uncle merrill's arm?
should we make a run for it out the back?
they're right behind the door.
he was only a year and half old.
what are you doing?
he was trying to eat a second chocolate bar. your grandma said, "no." he tried to take a bite, so i grabbed it.
we won't be able to get out of there.
i'm sorry i hurt your arm.
they'll read our minds!
you're scaring your sister.
merrill --
i'm looking!
merrill!
got it!
i can't even imagine.
i hope they're doing better than we are. we don't even have helmets.
they're distracting us?
from what?
the book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
what book!
they'll find a way in.
i can feel air.
me too.
it's getting stronger.
i'm close.
they're broadcasting...
it came on about two hours ago. woke me up.  we won graham.
how many died?
they think over a hundred thousand. they're just estimates.  but we held strong.
how do they know it's over?
a mass evacuation by them started about eight o'clock this morning. it's eleven now.  they're leaving. beat.
no.
listen, there's things i can take and a couple things i can't and one of them i can't take, is when my older brother --  -- who is everything i want to be, starts losing faith in things. i saw your eyes last night.  i don't want to ever see your eyes like that again, okay? i'm serious.
he's been like that for awhile. we need to get him some medicine.
have they said anything about our area?
philadelphia and its outlying counties are cleared, but who knows for sure?
he's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
i know.  we need to be sure, before we open that door graham.
that's good enough for me.
me too.
there was an accident. drunk driving. they weren't sure.
he wasn't drinking. ray fell asleep at the wheel.
is he okay?
yes... that's the first thing colleen asked too.
she's not in an ambulance father.
why not?
see father, ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... hit colleen and then a tree. she was pinned between the two.
pinned? what does that mean?
the truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
what did you say?
hi sweetie.
hi baby.
i was just taking a walk before dinner.
you love walks.
does it hurt?
i don't feel much.
good.
...tell morgan to play games -- it's okay to be silly.
...i will.
...tell bo to listen to her brother. he'll always take care of her.
...i will.
...tell graham --
i'm here.
tell him... see. tell him to see.
and tell merrill to swing away.
what?  colleen?... colleen?
don't touch him.
graham.
daddy.
don't touch him.
graham.
don't.
did someone save me?
yeah baby. i think someone did.
i think it's contaminated.
you don't even know what that word means.
it's not contaminated. it's just tap water. pour it in his bowl.
it tastes funny.
he licks his butt everyday. he's not going to mind.
