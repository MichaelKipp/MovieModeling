no thanks, I have seen seattle.
my name's larry mitchell. i live in vancouver.
same as an hour ago. remember? I am the steady type.
I am afraid there is nothing i can do about it, mr. mitchell.
you could tell me your name. and where you are going.
how far does this train go?
vancouver, b.c.
I am going to vancouver, mr. mitchell.
or reno?  they always throw them off the bridge there, I have heard.
perhaps i do not take it so lightly.
where are you staying in vancouver royal. it is pretty crowded you know.
is it? i expected to go to the vancouver royal. should i have a reservation?
I will make one for you.  i live there.
well..
a very small service. it does not even ask for thanks. how long for?
i really do not know.
indefinitely?
i do not know.
you do not know.
I am getting positively haggard. in a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
i see out friend larry mitchell is with us again.
I am afraid you are not very glad to see me, margo.
with your charm? how could i help it? have a nice trip?
so-so.
who is the girl?
her name's mayfield. betty mayfield.
nice.
she is just a girl i met on the train. you do not mind do you?
why should i mind?
you shouldn't. you washed me up very thoroughly.
as thoroughly as i could. it was not easy. but you are helping me.
margo, darling. you washed me up. remember? we are just friends. you wanted it that way.
she is very beautiful. she is much younger than i am. and she is rich, i hope.
rich? i have not the faintest idea. why?
you ought to know why.
i don't. my hunch is she is just torn up an unhappy marriage. i was able to do her a small favor.
splendid. now she can return the compliment.
i hoped to get enough to cover them before they cleared. i was not lucky.
you know what would happen to you if i turned these over to the police?
i have a rough idea.
you would go to jail. for a long term.
correct. i could not even afford to pay a lawyer to defend me.
what will we do about it, margo?
she is much younger than i am. that is something I am going to have to get used to. is not it, larry? they will all be much younger than i am. here.  tear them up.
I have always been a heel. i guess i always will be.
you do not have to make a pose of it.
it is the only pose i have left. I am sunk. broke. i do not even have my hotel bill.
i seem to recognize this routine. first the kiss then the touch.  oh, what is the use. you are you.
i seem to remember that you like to help yourself.
that is not very kind.
kind or not kind. what is the difference? it always ends up the same way.
what is this?
what does it look like?
how long have you had it?
years, why?
it is against the law to cross the border with a gun. the canadian police might like to know about this.
you already have the checks, darling.
i did not mean it that way  I am sorry.
oh, forget it. clark brandon's throwing a party up in his penthouse this evening. take me?
of course.
how about your new friend?
i told you she is just..
a girl you meet on the train. excuse my bringing it up again.  be back in an hour. right?
right.
in an hour, larry.
good afternoon, mr. campbell.
mr. mitchell.
a little something on account perhaps?
rather more than a little something, mr. mitchell.
I am afraid this is all for the moment.
i think we would better discuss this in my office, mr. mitchell.
nothing to discuss. tomorrow the sun will shine even brighter. be grateful for small mercies.
nice room. balcony and everything. lovely view too.
very nice mitchell turns.
no thanks?
thank you.
suppose i had not known that immigration inspector? had not put in a good word for you?
I am supposing.
i think you are a nice girl. i like you. but i can read signs if the print is large enough. it was your manner more than the wedding ring that bothered the inspector.  a sort of tenseness, as if you were afraid of something.
i have a darned good idea you are name is not betty mayfield at all.
yes?
how about taking to uncle larry into the old firm? he is a useful guy to have on your side.

do not get me wrong, betty. I am not suggesting you murdered anybody, you know.
dine and dance tonight? I have got fifty bucks to throw away.
not tonight.
what is the matter?
I am not in the mood for dining and dancing.
we have some nice places around vancouver.
I am sure you have.
well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  a friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
i have not been invited.
nobody gets invited to clark brandon's parties. they just go.
perhaps I would better get you straightened out, mr. mitchell. you have been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. and I am grateful. but i do not think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
nobody I would rather have on a leash.
the brush-off, huh?
I am trying very hard to be polite about it.
do not i even get my face slapped?
would you mind?
okay. you win.
if you change your mind about the cocktail party, or anything else, give me a buzz.
if i change my mind.
you can have the table yourself, if you would rather. I am only killing time.
no, please.
sit down then. we often have a double up here.
i see.
yes, miss.
I would like a dry martini. very dry, please.
sorry, miss. beer and ale only. canadian law.
beer?  well, all right.
beer or ale, miss?
ale. i do not mind.
right, miss.
your liquor laws..
disgusting, are not they? if you really want a martini, i know where you can get one.
a fellow named brandon has a penthouse here. he is holding open house. i was up there. too noisy. bored.
i see.
it might be worth a martini to you.
i do not need it that badly. i do not enjoy crashing other people's parties.
it is open-house. no crashing involved. anybody in the hotel's welcome.
what did you say his name was?
brandon. clark brandon. fellow about my age. lot of money... that he did not make. former american. now naturalized in canada. social standing indeterminate. manners not quite perfect. scotch superb.
you do not sound as if you liked him very much.
no.. not very well. and i like his friends even less. but..  if you really want a good dry martini..
as i said before...
sure. but I would hate like the dickens to be held to everything I have said before, would not you?
you are not paying for this. it is quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
i never pay for anything. they just keep me here to amuse the guests.
and do you amuse the guests?
no.  are you really going to drink that stuff?
you are drinking it.
i can be talked out of it. as a matter of fact, I would like a dry martini myself.
would it make you anymore amusing?
whatever you say.
i did not say anything.
i do not know you and you do not know me. i made a reasonably polite suggestion. but I am sure you would rather be alone.
i hate to be alone. but I have heard all the approaches there are... even yours.
neatly said...but to the wrong man. the trouble with pretty girls is that they can not imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. i get tired of it.
do you think i don't?
thanks for the fresh air. that felt good.
you are sure mr. brandon will not mind?
he does not even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor.
hello, mitchell. having fun?
the liquors lovely. the rest of the party you can have.
what is the matter, baby. do not you like me anymore?
lay off, can not you?
lay off what? this is my new girl friend. met her on the train. she is very fond of me. love at first sight. was not it, baby?
oh, the coldstream guards.  do not you take your hat off in elevators?
i never wear a hat.  oh, so i am. i forgot.  i guess I am terribly sorry again, mrs. west.
may you what?
oh nothing.
are you always this witty?
hi margo. hello killaine. you two come together?
in the same elevator. it is a public conveyance.
let me introduce you. mr.  killaine, mrs. west.
fascinated.
what will you have, margo?
martini.
you, killaine?
scotch and plain water, i think.
warm water, no doubt.
what?
a private joke.
it goes with this... cold houses and warm drinks...the effete englishman.
you are not english.
I am sorry. i forgot about calling for you.
it is quite unimportant, mr. mitchell. after all, you got what you wanted.
be nasty.
i have no intension of being nasty, mr. mitchell.
in that case, there is someone here I would like to introduce to you. over there.
she is beautiful. and young.  no thank you.
i say yes!
that is what i like about cocktail parties. everyone is so perfectly natural.
how is life treating you?
the usual grind.
round of golf saturday?
if i can get off.
betty, this is margo west. she wants to meet you. miss mayfield.
how do you do?
you are very attractive, my dear. and you look very unsophisticated.
unsophisticated?  if i knew about this babe...
i think I would like to dance.
why certainly, baby.
please be a little more careful how you talk, mr. mitchell.
how careful should i be?
i do not like being referred to as babe, or addressed as baby. i do not like your possessive attitude, nor your hints of secret knowledge. in fact, to be very frank, mr. mitchell, i do not think i like you.
maybe you are going to have to like me.
i think you are drunk.
just drunk enough.
what is the matter, baby? do not you like being kissed?
next time you try that, mr. mitchell...  ..don't. I am warning you.
do me a favor, mitchell. find yourself a nice secluded park bench.
did i do something wrong?
i would not know. just do it somewhere else. there is such a thing as good manners.
how would you know, brandon?
want to walk out... or get thrown out?
you do not throw guests out, brandon.
do not bet on it. I am eccentric.
dance?
no thank you.
would it have helped if I would knocked him down?
hardly. who is the girl?
somebody mitchell picked up on the train. i do not even know her name.
she does not look like a girl who would let herself be picked up on a train.
that is what i thought, at first.  maybe somebody else ought to have thrown this party.  with my liquor of course.
good evening, miss.
how soon can i get a plane to seattle?
I am afraid there is nothing more tonight, miss. unless you charter a plane.
how long would that take?
well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there is one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
immigration officer?
crossing the border this time of night they are a bit particular. you would have to prove your identity, you know... unless you have got a passport. they might even want to know why you are in such a hurry.  otherwise they might think...
they might think i was running away from something.
possibly, miss.
i know it is a littler late for an apology.
much too late.
do not take it so big... it is not a tragedy.
you said it was not a tragedy.
what is funny about that? if you pick up people like larry mitchell other people are bound to get funny ideas about you. the world is full of larry mitchells.
there is one less tonight.
there is not one.. that anyone would believe. i went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... i came up and went to bed. i did not sleep very well. then there was a thunderstorm. and it began to rain. i went across to close the french door. that is the first time i saw him out there.
he got in here how?
not with my consent, strange as it seems. i do not know how he got in. i do not know anything.
no. and I have never fired a gun in my life, are not you supposed not to touch it?
sure... but somebody always does..
they will know whether he killed himself.
i don't.
how did you meet him?
on a train. he said he lived here, and he offered to make a reservation for me.
nice of him.
he knew the immigration officer. he eased himself in.
he was a great boy for that. what else?
that is all there is.
go ahead...if you want to. it does not matter.
I would rather wait until it does matter.
you tried to run away.
there was not any plane.
it is always a mistake to run away. always.
want a spike in it?
no thanks.
you make friends quickly, do not you, clark?
sometimes.
and without much discrimination.
leave that one lay.
they still hang women in canada, I have heard.
so much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
oh, shut up!  you have not even got your spats on.
I am sorry. this thing has just knocked me silly.  how long do we have to wait for this police character?
until he comes. he is a nice guy. you have met him.
that comedian?
you in charge here?
so it seems sergeant.
right.
i hate to pull rank on you sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as "inspector". in moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me "sir".
i knew him. he was easy to dislike, poor chap.
they tell me he will be a great loss to the liquor trade. this mayfield girl...
... i supposed you knew her, too, inspector.
I have met her.
it is her room. she only got to the hotel this afternoon,. with him.  i guess he took too much for granted. here's the gun.
pearl-handled .25 automatic, uh?  no, it is a belgian gun... 6.6 mm.
correct, inspector. a woman's gun. u.s. 125 caliber ammunition in it. it was on a table in there.
this make of gun throws a shell backwards, high, and to the right. the chaise is only about four feet from the wall.
so the shell ought to have gone over?
unless the gun was slanted up.
so the wound and the shell give you the same answer.
right. a clean deduction from observed facts. they have got to be simple once in a while, inspector.
I have always looked forward to it. all right, let's get him out of here and tidy up.
mr. clarendon, have you ever seen this before?
I am sorry, inspector, i do not know much about..
recently, then.
no, not recently. I am sure of that.
thank you.
i never saw it before.
positive?
thank you.
yes, I have seen it before.
where?
on miss mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, i picked it up. do not ask me why. i ought to know better.
quite sure you had no motive?
could be.
i rather thought so. and before that, had you ever seen the gun?
no.
it was lying where on the balcony?
near his right hand. about a foot away. perhaps more. good heavens, one does not use a tape measure.
we do, when we get the chance.
i need not keep you any longer, mr. clarendon.
thank you. it is rather late... and I am not young anymore. good night.
what about me?
not quiet yet.
you knew mitchell pretty well, did not you, mrs. west?
i was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  why do not you ask her about the gun?
i shall. from your knowledge of mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I have felt it myself.
then why not give miss mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
I would be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I will wrap it up in tissue paper and put a christmas seals on it for her.
thank you very much, mrs. west.
how about a cup of coffee?
no thanks. i had some. how would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?
mrs. west is a very emotional woman.
i do not know her.. or particularly want to.
you probably know the type. you find them in hotels and resorts all over the world. they always have clothes, and money, and usually have had three or four husbands. they dress and enamel themselves with great care. they worry a great deal about those little lines at the corner of the eyes.. and they demonstrate their incompetence at the art of living bet getting mixed up with people like larry mitchell.  tell me about yourself, miss mayfield.
i was born in new york city. i grew up. and here i am.
I will have to know a little more than that.
I am sorry, that is all there is.
miss mayfield, the humor of the situation escapes me. within 24 hours i shall know officially whether mitchell was murdered. privately, I am quite sure of it now. it happened in your room, and you came to vancouver with him.. at any rate, he made your hotel reservation.. and you arrived together. here in this room he behaved nastily to you, and you said something to him which might be taken as a threat.  a few hours later he was found dead on your balcony. would it be too much too suggest that all these circumstances taken together are a little suspicious?
please answer my question.
you did not ask a question. you made a speech.
that is an evasion and you know it.
it is?
what are you doing here?
i do not think you locked your door.
what do you want?
see how easy it is? perhaps miss mayfield left her door unlocked. or if she didn't, there is a passkey on every floor in the linen room. the head porter has a passkey. the bell captain has a passkey. the hotel's full of passkeys.
passkey?
or--since one is a well-known and respected guest--one could go to the desk in the lobby and say "miss mayfield seems to have lost her room key--have you another"?  they always have another.
do not be a fool. i loved him. he was not worth it, but i loved him.
and now that he is safe from all other women, you can go on loving him.
you nasty, sardonic--
sardonic, if you will my dear. bust nasty. you lied about the gun.
I am a very observant man. you had something in your bag this afternoon, something that causes you to hold it in a particular way. something that made a particular sound when you put it down on the bar. you went out with mitchell. none of us ever saw him again.
that is not enough.
i saw your face this evening when the detective showed you the gun. you lied. it was obvious.
he saw my face too.
so he did--but he has not told you what he saw. i have.
they will arrest that girl. everything points to her.
convenient, is not it?
one of these days, you are going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you have cut your throat.
how clumsy. I would never forgive myself. good night my dear.
you could have got in that room, just as you got in here. how do i know you did not kill larry?
with what motive?
nastiness. you are nasty with words. why would not you be nasty with deeds once in a while? you hated him--and i know why.
he was very easy to hate. if you will look in your mirror, when you are in a better temper- you will know why.
well, that is not getting us anywhere. you will not tell me who you are, or give any account of yourself. you will not even give me your address in the united states. why? unhappy marriage?
who told you i was married?
there is the clear mark of a wedding ring on your finger.
your family coat of arms, mr. killaine?
regimental! seaforth highlanders.
I am sorry.
stop saying you are sorry. i want information, not regrets.
would you be satisfied if i said i shot him?
what this?
yes.
where is you get it?
a graduation present.
an unhappy marriage hardly seems a sufficient reason for that.
why do not you arrest me and be done with it.
i probably shall--after I have tortured you a little more.
how are you two getting along?
delightfully. every time miss mayfield says something, i know less than i did before.  well, i may as well knock off for tonight.  good night, miss mayfield. do let me thank you for your cooperation.
there is one thing i may as well tell you. you will find it out anyhow. i tried to run away--when i found him out there on the balcony. there was not any plane.
you did not have to tell him that.
bad?
bad enough.
he could hardly help suspecting you.
that is putting it mildly.
what time is it?
quarter after one. why?
there is a lot of night left to live through.
so there is. you do not want to go to bed. i do not want to go to bed. let's go somewhere and hear some music--have something to drink-- something to eat--even dance.
dance? tonight?
let's not pretend mitchell meant anything to either of us.
certainly not to me.
just who are you, anyway?
you, too?  my name is betty mayfield. i was born, and i am here. message ends. that is what i told him. he did not like it.
I am different. i like it fine.
in case you want to have us followed.
i don't.
well--good night.
cold?
is this the best you can do?
at this time of night. it is not as bad as it looks.
want to dance?
dance? here?
why not?
they know you here--know your name.
i know everybody. i do not look at half of life, just the nice half, i look at all of it.
that man over there. he was in the hotel lobby.
i did not notice him.
we walked right passed him. he is following us.
killaine's not that sort of guy. he said no--he meant no.
then he is got to be a detective.
could not be.
then he's--
quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
absolutely sure.
we will find out.
all right, let's see the buzzer.
what is a buzzer?
so you are not a cop.
me a cop? what made you think that, mr. brandon?
who told you my name?
I have got good ears.
how are your teeth getting along?
the new ones are fine. the last set i had gave me all kinds of trouble.
what is this in favor of?
i do not like to be tailed. the lady I am with does not like to be stared at. to put the matter in a couple of nutshells, i do not like you.
he is a fellow with a very hard knee, and he knows how to use it.
you do not know who he is?
he is not a cop. a cop would not have kneed me.
he was following us--but he is not a policeman.
us?
all right--following me.
why?
no matter. there is nothing i can do about it.
anything i can do about it?
take me home--and forget you ever saw me. that is a silly remark is not it?
try not talking.
it still does not matter if i kiss you?
nothing matters.
no use waiting, then.
that is the second round I have lost tonight.  that fellow hurt me.
so have i.
from you, i like it.
good morning. can i do something for you?
I am miss mayfield. is mr.  campbell here?
I am mr. campbell, miss mayfield.  purely as a matter of routine, i want to ask the name of your bank.
bank?
merely for our records, miss mayfield. it is usual for the guests who come here for the first time.
I am carrying quite a large sum in travelers checks. how much of a deposit would you like?
good morning, mr. killaine. I am sorry i can not give you the name of my bank--because i have no bank at the moment.  that was a crude trick.
they are all crude, when they do not work. had breakfast?
care for a stroll outside? beautiful morning. the air is like wine, the sky is a deep blue.
deep blue? I would call it grey-blue.
you must come from pretty far south.
florida?
I have never been to florida.
good morning, mr. brandon.
morning. any calls?
mr. reed would like you to call him.
all right. get him.
and there is a mr. goble to see you. says his business is personal.
who is goble?
I would like a few words with you, in private.
I am not interested in blind dates.
mr. reed, please, for mr.  brandon.  very well. have him call. mr. brandon is in his office now.  mr. reed stepped out, mr.  brandon.
this way.
nice friendly approach you have got. goble. i could hardly walk when i got out of bed this morning.
you asked for it.
I am still asking. what do you want?
I am not sure i want anything from you. you might want something from me.
name it.
information--protection--you might even want to hire me to go home and listen to the radio.  that is the funny part of my business-- once in a while, i get hired not to work.  nice girl you were with last night. known her long?
private eye?
you guessed it. the card's phony. i got plenty of 'em. different names, different jobs. i work out of san francisco. go anywhere, do anything. all it takes is the folding.
what are your rates?
$40 a day and expenses. expenses run pretty high on a case like this. I am a long way from home. i do not have a b.c. licence. I would need about $500 for a retainer.
what have you got on miss mayfield?
mayfield? oh, that girl you were with last night. you have not hired me yet. mr. brandon.
that is a nice hard knee you have got, goble. how did you like to trade it for a broken neck?
quit trying to scare me, mr. brandon, I am neurotic.
i do not know whether to knock your teeth down your throat--or call the police--or just give you twenty bucks to go out and buy yourself a clean nose.
you hurt my feelings. i ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
if i call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
bluff. you have waited too long.
for five hundred, what do i get?
i go home and paint the kitchen.
for two hundred?
i stick around and wait for the five hundred.
you mentioned information.
sorry. another client paid for that. you can hire me not to use it.
a thousand.
got it on you?
got the information on you?
get it in half an hour.
there is two hundred. I will meet you in an hour--where we met last night
why not here?
i do not like your perfume in my office. make it somewhere else if you do not like charlie's.
charlie's suits me fine. i do not scare.
down below's stanley park. on the other side of the trees, there is a beach. you can see it.  steveston's over there. coast guard station.  there is the yacht club, and beyond it, the docks. the over on the other side of the inlet, there is grouse mountain. it is about 4000 feet high. there is a restaurant on top of it. very nice restaurant.  I am sorry we could not have met in pleasanter circumstances, miss mayfield.
we would not have met at all.
true. i was a bit irritable last night. i apologize.
you were a galahad, compared to some cops I have known.
you have had dealings with the police before?
who hasn't--one way or another?
but not in the investigation of a major crime, i hope.
is it a crime?
we are 98 per cent certain mitchell was murdered. there are a lot of reasons.  was he very drunk when you last saw him?
you were there when i last saw him.
I would like to believe that. it is not too easy.
I will find out, you know. perhaps not today--perhaps not tomorrow. but in the end, I will find out.
the police always do, do not they?
you have has an experience that you do not want to talk about. an unhappy marriage, for example.
i would not make you talk about it. my job is the death of marry mitchell.  why can not you give me your confidence?
you--or the vancouver police department?
we try to be decent.
you are a police officer. a very nice one--but you have a job to do. I am a girl who is in a jam, and it is your job to keep me there. do not go considerate on me. i might start to bawl.
you will not tell me who you are? you will not even give me a chance to help you?
nobody can help me. you, least of all.
if i understand what you meant by that.
you understand perfectly.
then there is not much i can do, is there?
there is not anything you can do.
I am looking for mr. brandon.
the joint's not open, mac.  who is brandon?
i have an appointment with him, right here, right now.
go live in a tent.
it will be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
talk english.  how do i know you are you?
mr. brandon could not be here.  he might have left something for you. what would it look like?
one of those nice long manila envelopes--sealed.  not too fat- not too thin.
what do i get for it?
you get it is brother.
sounds like a fair swap.  let's take a look.
i need a receipt.  sign your name across the flap.
open it and count it.
when you sign for it, you count it.  it is your dough.
remember that time, did not i? good morning mrs. west.  does your visit here mean you have changed your mind?
how did you know?  clarendon.  you cops never tell anybody anything, do you.
other people always know so much more than we know--so much more than they are willing to tell us.
it was clarendon.  he knew i had the gun in my bag.
you could not possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
of course not.  thanks for telling me.  i have not seen mr. clarendon.
i am a fool.
that depends upon your motive. you were in love with mitchell, were not you?
yes--and he is already becoming vague to me.  funny!  last night i was furiously jealous.  jealous of what?  i out that gun in my bag deliberately.  who was i going to kill with it?  a girl i did not even know?  a man i knew to be a thief and a forger?  a half-man? a gigolo?  it is already ludicrous. love!  what a comedy!
you did not play it for laughs last night.
did you ever have a serious operation?
mortar shells are not funny, either.
at first, it does not hurt at all. that is shock.  then it hurts terribly--you would not believe such pain could exist--and six months later you can not remember what pain felt like.  it has not taken six months this time.  it has not even taken twenty- four hours.  is that a beastly thing to say?
not if it clears the air.
it does.  may i go now?
I will investigate mr. clarendon's financial position--
i do not understand.
perhaps a rich widow would have solved all his problems.
now, you are being beastly.
sure.  you did not come here in person just to tell me about the gun.  you wanted me to be looking across the desk at you while you talked about mitchell.  if i believe you, it would be psychologically impossible for you to have killed him last night.
and if you did not believe me?
you would still have planted information that clarendon knew about the gun--and not as an accusation, but in the process of defending yourself by making a confession.  very neat.  good morning, mrs. west.
killaine, this is mr. mitchell, senior.  young mitchell's father. he just flew in from toronto.
how do you do, sir.
I have explained the situation to mr. mitchell up to a point.  now about this mayfield girl?
she is a suspect, naturally.  but not the only one.
she is the only one who had a dead man in her room.  the only one who will not give an account of herself. the only one who tried to run away. and the only one, so far, I have been told, who went to such lengths to disguise her identity that she even removed the labels from her clothes.  what more do you want?
no.
i hear she is a very pretty girl.
which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
aye.  you have a point there.
am i to interpret that as an order to arrest miss mayfield?
when i give an order, you will not need it interpreted.  you have an hour to make your mind up.  well, are ye satisfied, mr. mitchell?
the harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
floater?
not a floater.  only just dead.
you are the waterfront specialist. find out about it.  I have got a murder to investigate.
you have two murders to investigate. this man's head was beaten in. and there is nothing in his pockets.
drunk-rolling job.  they hit him too hard.
I have been on the waterfront detail for twelve years.  this man had not been dead an hour.  he was not killed last night.  he was killed today. in broad daylight.  that is no drunk- rolling job.
let me know when you have identified him
and do not get too logical, driscoll. in police business it does not work. i wish it did.  but it does not
I am an irishman, sir.  an irishman is always logical.
this is not a very good place to talk.
i do not want to talk.
I have come here to arrest you for murder.
i expected nothing else.
i might be able to save you.  if i knew enough.
you would not even try  there must be some copper in you, or you would not be an inspector.
there must be-- but when I am with you i can not find it.
I am about to be very silly.  a man passes a girl on the street--a very lovely girl--his eyes meet her eyes, and something reaches out and takes hold of his heart-- and then she goes on and is lost in the crowd--and he says to himself, "there goes my lost love"-- and it is true--if he never sees her again, it is still true.  of course, after a while, he forgets-- or almost forgets--because after a while we forget almost everything.  but this man is a copper.  he gets orders--routine orders--to go to a place and investigate a murder-- and everything points to a certain girl.
points very straight to her.
he looks at the girl, looks into her eyes--
what does he see?
palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the taj mahal by moonlight--roses in an english garden, just after a shower--  clichs, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  pretty ridiculous, is not it?
very ridiculous.
that is my hard luck--i'm man enough to tell you about it--and not be sorry.
what do your friends call you?-- the ones that know you well?--and like you very much?
they call me jeff.
jeff.  shall we go now, jeff, and get it over with?
not quiet yet.  we know who the gun belonged to. margo west.  she told us this morning.  it does not mean much.  mitchell took it away from her.  he had a habit of going through her bag.
looking for peanuts, i suppose.
so mitchell had handled it. afterwards, brandon picked it up.  there is no indication you handled it.
i always wear gloves when i shoot people.  a bad joke--but better than tears.
time's up.  I am off the case.
they will only find someone else-- who will not be so kind.
that is something i can not spare you.  but i will not do it myself.
because you think your in love with me?
I am enough of a copper to do my duty.  my boss made it tough for me.  if i do not arrest you, I have gone soft.  if i do, it is to save my face.  i do not play those rules.
you have got a couple of hours, maybe.
to do what?
i can not answer that.
what will they do to you?
that is they are business.  can i drop you somewhere?
you are still a police officer, jeff.  i saw you send those two men away. i know they were watching me.
what are you going to do--toss your job into puget sound?  because i make you think of magnolias?  i thought policeman was something like a soldier.  that his duty came first.  however much he might happen hate it.
I have been a soldier too.  there is a difference.  a policeman, like a judge, has a right to disqualify himself on proper grounds.
what proper grounds?  you can not be in love with me.  you hardly know me.  I am not in love with you.
i know that.
but even if you were in love with me.
there is an empty taxi across the street.  if you are so anxious, take it.  he will know the way to the police headquarters.
you do things the hard way, do not you?
sometimes.
not sometimes.  always.  just because it is the hard way.  you are that kind of man, jeff.
goodbye, betty.
are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
a little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
it will not look pretty good on your record, killaine.  where is the girl now?
i do not know, sir.
well, find out.  who is covering her?
nobody's covering her, i detached the officer assigned to that duty.
this girl is a murderess, killaine.
i disagree, sir.  as inspector in charge of the case i have the right to form that opinion, the right to act on it.
ye have, have ye?
we lifted seven fairly good prints from miss mayfield's toilet articles.  washington ought to teletype us within a few hours.
and in the meantime this girl goes where she pleases, does what she pleases?
yes, sir.
"superintendent j. mckechnie, vancouver police department. vancouver b.c. replaying to your e.p. teletype classification no. 2684 incomplete.  we advise identification possible.  elizabeth kinsolving, arrested greenwater, north carolina, january 8, 1948, on a charge of murder.  signed, fbi., washington, d.c. h. cleary, inspector in charge."  have ye any comment, killaine?
identification on possible, sir. not conclusive.
"superintendent j. mckechnie, vancouver police department. replying your inquiry elizabeth kinsolving.  subject was indicted, first degree murder her husband, lee kinsolving, january this year. guilty verdict set aside by presiding judge.  prisoner discharged, whereabouts now unknown. fingerprint classification"--  and exact correspondence, killaine.
"physical description: age 26, height 5  1 3/4 inches: weight, 188 pounds: light brown hair: deep blue eyes: small, perfectly formed features: ears and earlobes small: slender build: wears size 4 aa shoe: quiet refined manner: new york accent: no charges pending. no prior criminal record.  mayfield, mother's name.  air-mailing you photographs today.  signed hubert tollison, chief of police, greenwater, north carolina."  she bleached her hair, or course.  would your sensibilities be offended, if i sent out a general alarm to pick up this girl?
i think you would be entirely justified, sir.
but you still think she is innocent.
i do.
i believe you won decorations during the war.
two.
there are people in this world who do not think a police badge is a badge of honor.  I am not one of them.
nor i. this is why i gave it to you.
you are a young man.  you are romantic.  you think a pretty face and a clean conscience go together. you think a soft voice means a soft heart.  you will grow out of that.
not too far, i hope.
this badge is not an old newspaper you can cast down on the desk.  it is not a thing you can give up as of no value.  it may be taken from you--and you may die defending it. but you will not use it to make cheap dramatic gesures with.  it is a naked steel of the sword of justice.  put it back in your pocket and hold tight to it--and someday you might grow into a worthiness ye lack now.
get out of here!
what are my orders, sir?
you think I am wrong about this bit of a girl.  go out and prove it against me!
got a moment, inspector?
I have got a year.  or a second. I am not sure which.
you told me when we would identified this fellow--
we have done that.  he is a san francisco private eye.  name martin j. goble, g-o-b-l-e.  had initials in his hat and for once he lived where he bought it.  goble and greer is the firm name.
swimming with his hat on?  that is original.
if you would seen the blood on his head--and some body had to carry him out to sea--
i understand.  pity to mess up a nice clean boat.
i got through to greer, his partner in the detective business.  greer will not give out.
I would suggest a telegram.  something like this: chief of police, san francisco.  a licensed private detective named named martin j. goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  his partner, name something-something greer, refuses to give us any information. correction.  refuses information necessary to our investigation. can you assist?  signed detective sergeant driscoll, vancouver, british columbia, police.
send that?
would you?
if you are asking my opinion, no. I would read it to greer over the phone. ask him if he had any objections.
catch me at the vancouver royal if it is important.
how important would it have to be? it is only murder, inspector.
the super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I have ever had.  I am still reeling from it. and believe me, i had it coming. i apologize.  what you think is important--i think is important.
thanks, inspector.  what are your orders about this wire to san francisco?
men like you do not need orders.
time for a little chat?
if it does not take too long.  drink?
thanks.  i do not mind.
thanks.  lovely view you have, have not you?
i never notice the view after the first week.
i would.  fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  wonderful thing, money is.  remember what somerset maugham said about it ?
i would not know.
"money is a sort of sixth sense that gives meaning to all the others." very appealing, especially to a poor man.
could we discuss that some other time?
sure.  let's discuss betty mayfield.  how long since you saw her?
a couple of hours.
i have a warrant for her arrest.
that must hurt.
I have always thought you were a pretty nice guy, brandon.  I would like to go on thinking so.  if you tried to help her get away--
would that make me a heel?
you would be breaking the law.
does not answer the question.
the only answer i have for you.
you passed up a dozen chances to arrest her.  what toughened you up?
information.
do not kid me.  you do not think she murdered mitchell.
it could have been an accident.
that could be told.
not if she knew she would not be believed.
your concentrating too hard, killaine.  what about margo west? she had a motive.  i guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
and old man clarendon?  he had a motive, too.  margo and her money.
mitchell was killed down here.  how could clarendon get in to do it?  or margo for that matter.
how could mitchell?  after that act he put on up here, is it likely she would let him in?
she did not have to.  he could have climbed down from here.
mitchell was too drunk.
or just drunk enough.  he was with her when she registered.  he knew where her room was.  you were out most of the evening.  there was a lot of mess to clean up . waiters coming and going, the door standing open.  suppose mitchell came in to grab a drink for himself, then wandered out on this balcony, then realized betty's balcony was just below yours.
romeo in reverse.  uh-uh.  no sale, killaine.
you do not buy it.  okay.  so i still want betty mayfield.  where is she?
no idea.
it sounds like a fair location. could you be a little more exact?
I am in the hudson bay company's store.  that man last night--the one that followed me--
i do not think that is on the market anymore.  I would like something much closer to the water.
cant be too close for me.  right across the street from it suits me.  anything else listed?
there is another man--right outside the booth here.  i never saw him before.
you are probably mistaken about that.  let's get together sand talk it over.  there is always a solution to these problems.  but it must be near the water.  quite near--  yes, if you do not mind waiting.
no more for me, thanks.  remember what i said.  i can not interfere with the law.
where would she go, anyway.  do not tell me you have not got her covered.
you forgetting the gag line, killaine.  the police do not take anything for granted.
I am afraid they do.  far too often. so long.
wait a minute.  I will go with you.
you do a lot of real estate trading, brandon?
now and then.  mostly just for the fun of it.
i tried it once.  i lost my shirt.
i buy my shirts by the dozen. fortunately.
where did it all come from?  or is that a permissible question?
i had a father who knew how to steal.
what?
you asked me where it all came from.
oh.  that was just one of those idle questions.  one does not expect an answer.
i hated to go to that place.  i almost went to the police station instead.
no percentage in that.
they are going to arrest me.
i know.  killaine has a warrant.
i have my own warrant.  stop a minute, please.
if you meant it, you would not show it to me, betty.  or am i supposed to deliver it to dear inspector killaine?
wrote it in the waiting room of the hudson bay store.  with somebody is pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  perhaps you are right.  perhaps i did not mean it. all i know is that I am licked.
there is a lot of water between vancouver and the u.s.a. this note is a suicide note.  after you are gone where would they look for you?  why would they look for you? darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  and i have a pocket full of money.  and if i helped you, I would be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
that was not why i called you.  why did i hope--when i had not any right to hope?
how bad is it?  bad enough for--
yes.  I have never been very far from it, for a long time.  will you do something for me?
take me where i have not the courage to take myself.
how bad is the other thing?  the secret?
i was tried for murdering my husband.  guilty.  the judge set the verdict aside.  there was one man on the jury--  --but he was afraid.  they were all afraid--of my father-in-law. that man followed me last night-- he came from him of course.  my father-in-law will never give up. never.  he promised me that.  so i came to vancouver, b.c. as far away as i can get from north carolina.  and it happens all over again.  almost the same thing. almost the same way.  do you wonder about this--
this is the ace, betty.  but not of spades.  they will find out about the other.  they might know already. and when they get this--  what would they look for?  where? out there somewhere?
they will look for you.
i run over to victoria.  play some golf with some people i know.  do it all the time.  that is why i have a cabin cruiser.  custom- built.forty knots.  mr clark brandon an almost gentleman of almost complete leisure.  member of six golf clubs.  broke 70 once on the shaughnessy heights course.  you have to be good to do that, and if you look out of a front window of the empress hotel in victoria, in a few hours you can look right down on mr. brandon's boat, the valkyrie.  came alone?  sure.  he always comes alone.  mr brandon's a rather lonely man.
and betty mayfield--
blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  and where to go.  she might have dyed her hair.  bleached it before probably.  and changed her name again.  but look at this note.  and look at her room in the hotel. her stuff is all there.  has not a rag except what she stood up in. you do not run away like that.  not if you are young and beautiful. no chance.
but that is what I am doing.  could not they think of that?
if they had any reason to.  why make it tough for themselves?  why go to all that trouble?  here's an open book.  close it.  no reason to keep it open.  she was a nice girl, anyway.  and perhaps she did not kill him on purpose.  perhaps she did not kill the other one. you never know.  give her the benefit of the doubt.  leave her stay where she is.  close the book. finis.
killaine...
the best interference runner we have got.  he thinks he is in love with you--and he is a gentleman.  come here, baby.
you will be safe here.  i will not be long.  help yourself to anything you want. the galley's through there.  you can make coffee if you like.
this must have cost a fortune.
it did, but it never paid off-- until now.  i ought to be back within an hour. we can not leave until near dark anyway.
do you have to leave the note?
it is the frame on the picture. but not if you say so.
I would still go through--even if i ended up in jail.
you would not like it.  I have been there.
my father died in jail, and he was twice the man i am.
well?
you leave it.
she did not seem the type to lam out--even if she got the chance. that stuff was all gone through last night.  anything special you are looking for, inspector?
I will know when i find it.
i guess I am just ballast around here.
"g.g. market one-eight-four-two."
gigi, huh?  sounds french--one of those fancy ladies.  must have been very fancy, if he scratched her phone number in gold.
market... it seems to me that is a san francisco exchange.
killaine's wise.  we can not wait any longer.  here, put this on.  but stay out of sight until we clear the harbor.  I will tell you when.
killaine's wise to what?
that is pretty risky business, inspector.
somebody did it twice last night-- in the dark.
not too hard, is it?
maybe we have been pretty dumb--
there was not any motive...let's try out the act.
was that about the right angle?
i think so.
where is the shell?
should be over there.
you have got a dead man on your hands. you killed jim--even if it was not murder.  what are you going to do about it?
if I have got any sense I am going to call headquarters.
they will probably believe you.  but they will want to know what you were fighting about.  why mitchell had a gun.  you will tell them a simple story.  they will pretend it sounds all right to them.  now you are headquarters.  how does it sound to you?
before i took the story and closed the case, I would want to know a lot more about these people.  I would want to know just about everything about them.
exactly.  now I am the killer.  and there is something i do not want you to know.  something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
such as?
assume there is something to hid. i go to a lot of trouble.  what do i do?  what would you do?
do i know who lives down there?
you can find out.
do i know that she is out of the room?  likely to be out of it for some time?
you can find out the first part. the second part you have to take a chance on.
pretty big chance, huh?
you have got a dead man on your hands. like this.
this is the shell.  what about the gun?
well.  what about it?
I have handled it.  mitchell's handed it.  if i wipe it off, no suicide. if i take it out and lose it, no suicide.  if i leave it here....no suicide.
so?
I have got to find a way to handle it, openly.  like brandon.
how did he know he would get the chance? he could not have arranged it.
he could have tried.  if he was up there in the dark, listening, he would know when she came home, know when she found mitchell dead, know what she did about it.  if she telephoned, he would probably hear that.
and she did give him the chance, the way it worked out.
if she didn't--if luck was against him--he wipes the gun off, reaches the wall up there--drops it on the chaise.
no suicide.
did we ever really think it was suicide?
you win, inspector.  you win all along the line.  why did not we think of brandon before--or did we-- some of us.  yeah.  of course you did.  when a suspect thinks he is safe, you go on letting him think he is safe. wait for a mistake.
and a motive--which we have not got.  so this could all be a dream.
greer and goble in the call building, san francisco.  just like you thought...two murders in two days.  different places, different methods, different people. nothing connects them, but a telephone number.
a think wire---but very, very strong.  let's get out of here.
see anything?
i can still see the shoreline. the moon is rising.
there would be a moon tonight.
cold?
frozen.
go down into the cabin and get yourself a drink.  careful how you go, we are hitting the swell now.
i decided i did not want a drink...i'm beginning to wonder.
wonder what?
if you are doing all this just for me.
that, and the fun of it.
i thought you had to be back to the hotel.  to leave my--my note.
that is right.
funny, i never thought of you that way.  you were so close too.  we were all pretty stupid about you.
including killaine.
including killaine...i still can not think of you that way.
i told you my father died in jail. he stole a fortune.  most of it pretty dirty money.  i do not care to have that known.
larry mitchell found out.  so you killed him.
in a way.
if it was an accident, you could have told the truth.
so could you.  but our records were a little against us.
what your father did does not condemn you.
nobody believed i was not in on it. i was just a dumb-smart collage boy, and he was my father.  i thought it was a legitimate business.  he was a politician, with fingers in a lot of pies.  i never saw the pies.  they had names. for the record.  innocent names.  you know where that kind of money comes from, do not you?
the money that makes you mr. clark brandon.  let's you live in a penthouse, on top of the vancouver royal.  lets you own a cruiser. lets you do as you please, go where you please.  you big, open-handed, generous guy.  that is the kind of money it takes, is not it?
it buys things, just like any other kind.
that man that was following us last night--he did not come back this morning.  I am beginning to wonder about him, too.  was he really following me--or you?
no.  i paid him off.
he will come back...they always come back when you give them money.
not this one.  and not mitchell.
you-killed-him?
magruder obliged me.  no use my saying it was not planned that way. i had to clean up.  I am not a dumb- smart college boy anymore.  nobody in the world would believe i did not plan the whole thing.
i guess I am a little screwy.  maybe i could believe it.  should i try?
do not go soft on me, baby.  I have got your note in my pocket.  you wrote it, all by your own self. and i have to use it.  it has to be found in exactly the right place.
so that i will never be found.
yes, i think so.  here are two glazed manila envelopes.  one is the bag type.  the other one had the money in it.  do not ask me how i know.  i know.
I am interested in who handled it.
four different people, inspector. three men and a women.  I have made slides for two.  they handled both envelopes.
no doubt about that one.
how about magruder?
he checks too.
that leaves two strangers.
so far.
try betty mayfield.  the mitchell case.
mayfield?  she fit into this?
she might.
you will have to take my word for it.  we do not make slides until we have perfect prints for comparison.
I will take your word.
this gun permit was issued to clark brandon?
the card says so, does not it?
brandon handled the money envelope.
what is the face for, driscoll?
magruder's conked out.  adrenaline injections, oxygen tent.  he may come out of it and he may not.  as a source of quick information, we can not forget him.
we do not need him.
you will never make it.  you have out- smarted yourself.
I am still on course to victoria. nobody saw you get on board, nobody seen you since.
it was not the time or place.  do not worry about the note, baby.  I am playing for my neck now.
and I am begging for my life--and yours.
mine?
yes.  yours.  you have not murdered anybody.  you killed mitchell. was not that an accident?  it must have been.  if you kill a blackmailer, you kill him dead--so that he can not talk anymore.
mitchell was dead enough.
and that nasty man that followed us last night.  you did not kill him.
who would believe it but you?  i took him out to sea and threw him in the water.  even if they find him, what connects him with me?
magruder does.
you think magruder wants to hang beside me?
but the next one is murder.  first the little step, then the longer step , and then the step you can never take back.  you could tell about mitchell.  you could tell about magruder--and the detective. it would hurt, but you could do it.  you could never tell about me.
would i want to?
every day of your life you will want me.  you will never get over it. every time you see your face in the mirror--
shut up!  cut it out!  even if i have to kill both of us--
this is it, betty.  they will find us again, fog or no fog.
if it has to be--do you mind if i do it myself?  oh, i do not mean with the gun. this is no trick.  when i wrote that note you have in your pocket-- that was no trick either.  it is not so hard for me as you think. I am not crying about it, I have been skating close to it for quite some time.  the water is cold down there--  but so is everything else.  and there is you.
me?
yes.  you.  you are not really a murderer yet.
i think you mean that.
do you think i was faking?
if i did-i don't-now.
he could have killed me a dozen times.  you would never have known.
we know everything.
no, jeff.  you don't.  he is not a murderer, i tell you.  he;s not a murderer.
i hope he can prove it.  come on. you do not want to get pneumonia.
but i tell you---if you would only understand.
i understand, betty.  i understand perfectly.
