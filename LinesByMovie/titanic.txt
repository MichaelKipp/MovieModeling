i'm in the sitting room. heading for bedroom b-54.
stay off the floor. don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
i'm tryin' boss.
who's the best? say it.
you are, lewis.  you rolling?
shit.
you know, boss, this happened to geraldo and his career never recovered.
get that outta my face.
the partners want to know how it's going?
how it's going? it's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
there's a satellite call for you.
bobby, we're launching. see these submersibles here, going in the water? take a message.
no, trust me, you want to take this call.
this is brock lovett. what can i do for you, mrs...?
rose calvert.
...mrs. calvert?
i told you you wanted to take this call.
alright. you have my attention, rose. can you tell me who the woman in the picture is?
she says she's rose dewitt bukater, right? rose dewitt bukater died on the titanic. at the age of 17. if she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
a hundred and one next month.
okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. i traced her as far back as the 20's... she was working as an actress in l.a. an actress. her name was rose dawson. then she married a guy named calvert, moved to cedar rapids, had two kids. now calvert's dead, and from what i've heard cedar rapids is dead.
is your stateroom alright?
yes. very nice. have you met my granddaughter, lizzy? she takes care of me.
there, that's nice. i have to have my pictures when i travel. and freddy of course.  isn't that right, sweetie.
would you like anything?
i should like to see my drawing.
louis the sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the blue diamond of the crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time louis lost everything from the neck up. the theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became le coeur de la mer. the heart of the ocean. today it would be worth more than the hope diamond.
it was a dreadful, heavy thing.  i only wore it this once.
i tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. do you know who the claiment was, rose?
someone named hockley, i should imagine.
nathan hockley, right. pittsburgh steel tycoon. for a diamond necklace his son caledon hockley bought in france for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on titanic. and the claim was filed right after the sinking. so the diamond had to've gone down with the ship.  see the date?
april 14, 1912.
if your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day titanic sank.  and that makes you my new best friend. i will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery.
we've put together the world's largest database on the titanic. okay, here...
rose might not want to see this, lewis.
it's been 84 years...
just tell us what you can --
it's been 84 years... and i can still smell the fresh paint. the china had never been used. the sheets had never been slept in.
your daughter is much too hard to impress, ruth.  mind your step.
so this is the ship they say is unsinkable.
it is unsinkable. god himself couldn't sink this ship.
steerage swine. apparently missed his annual bath.
honestly, cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family.
all part of my charm, ruth. at any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late.
you told me to change.
i couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. it's bad luck.
i felt like black.
let's see... fabrizio's got niente. olaf, you've got squat. sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.  sorry fabrizio.
what sorry? what you got? you lose my money?? ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo --
sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...
'cause you're goin' to america!! full house boys!
porca madonna!! yeeaaaaa!!!
goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs! on the titanic!! we're ridin' in high style now! we're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!
you see? is my destinio!! like i told you. i go to l'america!! to be a millionaire!!  capito?? i go to america!!
you know somebody?
of course not. that's not the point.  goodbye! goodbye!! i'll miss you!
those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
you're wrong. they're fascinating. like in a dream... there's truth without logic. what's his name again...?  picasso.
he'll never amount to a thing, trust me. at least they were cheap.
you know i don't like that, rose.
she knows.
my god, rose, what's gotten into --
excuse me.
take my hand. i'll pull you back in.
no! stay where you are. i mean it. i'll let go.
no you won't.
what do you mean no i won't? don't presume to tell me what i will and will not do. you don't know me.
you would have done it already. now come on, take my hand.
you're distracting me. go away.
i can't. i'm involved now. if you let go i have to jump in after you.
don't be absurd. you'll be killed.
the fall alone would kill you.
it would hurt. i'm not saying it wouldn't. to be honest i'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
how cold?
freezing. maybe a couple degrees over.
ever been to wisconsin?
no.
well they have some of the coldest winters around, and i grew up there, near chippewa falls. once when i was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on lake wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
i know what ice fishing is!
sorry. just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. anyway, i went through some thin ice and i'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. you can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  which is why i'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. but like i said, i don't see a choice. i guess i'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
you're crazy.
that's what everybody says. but with all due respect, i'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship.
i'm jack dawson.
pleased to meet you, mr. dawson.
help! help!!
i've got you. i won't let go.
what made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! look at me, you filth! what did you think you were doing?!
cal, stop! it was an accident.
an accident?!
it was... stupid really. i was leaning over and i slipped.
i was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. and i slipped and i would have gone overboard... and mr. dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.
you wanted to see the propellers?
is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
rose is displeased. mmm... what to do?
i know.  perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
sure. count me in.
good. settled then.
this should be amusing.
can i bum a cigarette?
my god... cal. is it a --
diamond. yes it is. 56 carats.
it was once worn by louis the sixteenth. they call it le coeur de la mer, the --
the heart of the ocean. cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
i can still feel its weight. if you could have felt it, not just seen it...
well, that's the general idea, my dear.
so let me get this right. you were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the titanic?  that's great!
lewis...
rose, tell us more about the diamond. what did hockley do with it after that?
i'm afraid i'm feeling a little tired, mr. lovett.
wait! can you give us something go on, here. like who had access to the safe. what about this lovejoy guy? the valet. did he have the combination?
that's enough.
hey, lizzy. i need to talk to you for a second.
don't you mean work me?
look, i'm running out of time. i need your help.
i'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and one year old grandmother. i came down here to tell you to back off.
lizzy... you gotta understand something. i've bet it all to find the heart of the ocean. i've got all my dough tied up in this thing. my wife even divorced me over this hunt. i need what's locked inside your grandma's memory.  you see this? right here?
what?
that's the shape my hand's gonna be when i hold that thing. you understand? i'm not leaving here without it.
look, brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. don't forget, she contacted you. she's out here for her own reasons, god knows what they are.
maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
what past? she has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the titanic until two days ago.
then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
you think she was really there?
oh, yeah. yeah, i'm a believer. she was there.
hello again.
could i speak to you in private?
uh, yes. of course. after you.
so, you got a name by the way?
rose. rose dewitt bukater.
that's quite a moniker. i may hafta get you to write that down.
mr. dawson, i --
jack.
jack... i feel like such an idiot. it took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
well, here you are.
here i am. i... i want to thank you for what you did. not just for... for pulling me back. but for your discretion.
you're welcome. rose.
look, i know what you must be thinking! poor little rich girl. what does she know about misery?
that's not what i was thinking. what i was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
i don't... it wasn't just one thing. it was everything. it was them, it was their whole world. and i was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  i just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then i was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the titanic wasn't big enough. not enough to get away from them. and before i'd really though about it, i was over the rail. i was so furious. i'll show them. they'll be sorry!
uh huh. they'll be sorry. 'course you'll be dead.
oh god, i am such an utter fool.
that penguin last night, is he one of them?
penguin? oh, cal! he is them.
is he your boyfriend?
worse i'm afraid.
so you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.
yes, exactly!
so don't marry him.
if only it were that simple.
it is that simple.
oh, jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
well, i guess i will tonight.
what's this?
just some sketches.
may i?
jack, these are quite good! really, they are.
well, they didn't think too much of 'em in paree.
oh no! oh, i'm so sorry. truly!
well, they didn't think too much of 'em in paree.
and these were drawn from life?
yup. that's one of the great things about paris. lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
you liked this woman. you used her several times.
she had beautiful hands.
i think you must have had a love affair with her...
no, no! just with her hands.
you have a gift, jack. you do. you see people.
i see you.
and...?
you wouldn'ta jumped.
so you've not lit the last four boilers then?
no, but we're making excellent time.
captain, the press knows the size of titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. we must give them something new to print. and the maiden voyage of titanic must make headlines!
i prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in.
of course i leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into new york tuesday night and surprise them all.  retire with a bang, eh, e.j.?
you know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!
you wouldn't last two days. there's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
listen, buster... i hate caviar! and i'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
i'm sorry. really... i am.
well, alright. there's something in me, jack. i feel it. i don't know what it is, whether i should be an artist, or, i don't know... a dancer. like isadora duncan.... a wild pagan spirit...
so then what, mr. wandering jack?
well, then logging got to be too much like work, so i went down to los angeles to the pier in santa monica. that's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. i sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
a whole ten cents?!
yeah; it was great money... i could make a dollar a day, sometimes. but only in summer. when it got cold, i decided to go to paris and see what the real artists were doing.
why can't i be like you jack? just head out for the horizon whenever i feel like it.  say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
alright, we're going. we'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
you mean one leg on each side? scandalous! can you show me?
sure. if you like.
i think i would.  and teach me to spit too. like a man. why should only men be able to spit. it's unfair.
they didn't teach you that in finishing school? here, it's easy. watch closely.
mother, may i introduce jack dawson.
charmed, i'm sure.
i saw that in a nickelodeon once, and i always wanted to do it.
cal, surely you remember mr. dawson.
just a soupcon of lemon...  ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
no caviar for me, thanks.  never did like it much.
your ship is a wonder, mr. andrews. truly.
thank you, rose.
no thanks. i'm heading back.
probably best. it'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. wouldn't interest you. good of you to come.
jack, must you go?
time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
may i cut in, miss?
you're still my best girl, cora.
i don't know the steps.
just move with me. don't think.
how you two doin'?
i don't know what she's say, she don't know what i say, so we get along fine.
you're not one of them. there's been a mistake.
a mistake?
uh huh. you got mailed to the wrong address.
i did, didn't i?  look! a shooting star.
that was a long one. my father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
i like that. aren't we supposed to wish on it?
i had hoped you would come to me last night.
i was tired.
yes. your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
i see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
you will never behave like that again! do you understand?
i'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! i am your fiancee --
rose, this is not a game! our situation is precarious. you know the money's gone!
of course i know it's gone. you remind me every day!
your father left us nothing but a legacy of bad debts hidden by a good name. and that name is the only card we have to play.
i don't understand you. it is a fine match with hockley, and it will insure our survival.
how can you put this on my shoulders?
do you want to se me working as a seamstress? is that what you want? do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds? my god, rose, how can you be so selfish?
it's so unfair.
of course it's unfair! we're women. our choices are never easy.
mr. andrews, i did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
about half, actually. rose, you miss nothing, do you? in fact, i put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here.  but it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. so i was over-ruled.
rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl i've ever known and --
jack, i --
no wait. let me try to get this out. you're amazing... and i know i have nothing to offer you, rose. i know that. but i'm involved now. you jump, i jump, remember? i can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright.
you're making this very hard. i'll be fine. really.
i don't think so. they've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. but sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
it's not up to you to save me, jack.
you're right. only you can do that.
i have to get back, they'll miss me. please, jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone.
fabrizio said you might be up --
sssshh. come here.
will this light do? don't artists need good light?
zat is true, i am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions.  hey... monet!
cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
should i be expecting him anytime soon?
not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.
what is it? a sapphire?
a diamond. a very rare diamond, called the heart of the ocean.
i believe you are blushing, mr. big artiste. i can't imagine monsieur monet blushing.
he does landscapes.
none of the stewards have seen her.
this is ridiculous, lovejoy. find her.
i don't think i've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
yes, like a mill pond. not a breath of wind.
it's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base.
mmmmm. well, i'm off. maintain speed and heading, mr. lightoller.
yes sir.
and wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful.
pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
he's an ex-pinkerton. cal's father hired him to keep cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
kinda like we're doin' right now -- uh oh!
where to, miss?
to the stars.
are you nervous?
au contraire, mon cher.
you're trembling.
it's okay. i'm alright.
you can smell ice, you know, when it's near.
bollocks.
well i can.
when this ship docks, i'm getting off with you.
this is crazy.
i know. it doesn't make any sense. that's why i trust it.
cor... look at that, would ya.
they're a bloody sight warmer than we are.
well if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, i'd rather not, if it's all the same.
oy, mate... that was a close shave.
smell ice, can you? bleedin' christ!
looks okay. i don't see anything.
could it have damaged the ship?
it didn't seem like much of a bump. i'm sure we're okay.
why have we stopped?
we've struck ice.
well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?
excuse me.
it's bad.
we have to tell mother and cal.
now it's worse.
come with me, jack. i jump, you jump... right?
right.
something serious has happened.
that's right. two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. now that one is back...  ...i have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  search him.
this is horseshit.
cal, you can't be serious! we're in the middle of an emergency and you --
don't you believe it, rose. don't!
he couldn't have.
but i was with him the whole time.
maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
water 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six.
that's right.
five compartments. she can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. but not five. not five. as she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at e deck... from one to the next... back and back. there's no stopping it.
the pumps --
the pumps buy you time... but minutes only. from this moment, no matter what we do, titanic will founder.
how much time?
an hour, two at most.
it's just the god damned english doing everything by the book.
there's no need for language, mr. hockley.  go back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back.
i saw the iceberg, mr. andrews. and i see it in your eyes. please tell me the truth.
the ship will sink.
you're certain?
yes. in an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the atlantic.
please tell only who you must, i don't want to be responsible for a panic. and get to a boat quickly. don't wait. you remember what i told you about the boats?
yes, i understand. thank you.
oh, mother shut up!  don't you understand? the water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. half the people on this ship are going to die.
not the better half.
rose, get in the boat!
goodbye, mother.
where are you going? to him? is that it? to be a whore to that gutter rat?
i'd rather be his whore than your wife.
keep pulling... away from the ship. pull.
ain't you boys ever rowed before? here, gimme those oars. i'll show ya how it's done.
mr. andrews, thank god! where would the master at arms take someone under arrest?!
what? you have to get to a boat right away!
no! i'll do this with or without your help, sir. but without will take longer.
take the elevator to the very bottom, go left, down the crewman's passage, then make a right.
bottom, left, right. i have it.
hurry, rose.
that guy lovejoy put it in my pocket.
i know, i know.
see if you can find a key for these. try those drawers. it's a little brass one.
so... how did you find out i didn't do it?
i didn't.  i just realized i already knew.
you have to go for help.
i'll be right back.
i'll wait here.
will this work?
we'll find out.
she's not on the starboard side either.
we're running out of time. and this strutting martinet...  ...isn't letting any men in at all.
the one on the other side is letting men in.
then that's our play. but we're still going to need some insurance.  come on.
the boats are all going.
we gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. where's tommy?
i make my own luck.
so do i.
the suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going.
we got room for lots more. i say we go back.
no! it's our lives now, not theirs. and i'm in charge of this boat! now row!!
we're too late.
there are still some boats forward. stay with this one... murdoch. he seems to be quite... practical.
i'm not going without you.
get in the boat, rose.
there are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. jack and i can get off safely. both of us.
i'll be alright. hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
get in... hurry up, it's almost full.
you're a good liar.
almost as good as you.
i always win, jack. one way or another.  pity i didn't keep that drawing. it's going to be worth a lot more by morning.
you jump, i jump, right?
right.
what could possible be funny?
i put the diamond in my coat pocket. and i put my coat... on her.
won't you even make a try for it, mr. andrews?
i'm sorry that i didn't build you a stronger ship, young rose.
good luck to you, rose.
and to you, mr. andrews.
look for something floating. some debris... wood... anything.
it's so cold.
i know. i know. help me, here. look around.
they'll pull us right down i tell ya!
aw knock it off, yer scarin' me. come on girls, grab your oars. let's go.  well come on!
i don't understand a one of you. what's the matter with you? it's your men back there! we got plenty a' room for more.
if you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!
it's getting quiet.
just a few more minutes. it'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
no... don't say your good-byes, rose. don't you give up. don't do it.
i'm so cold.
you're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. not here. not this night. do you understand me?
i can't feel my body.
rose, listen to me. listen. winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me.
you must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
i promise.
never let go.
i promise. i will never let go, jack. i'll never let go.
yes, i lived. how awkward for you.
rose... your mother and i have been looking for you --
is this in any way unclear?
what do i tell your mother?
tell her that her daughter died with the titanic.
you're precious to me, rose.
jewels are precious. goodbye, mr. hockley.
i'm sorry.
we were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
don't come any closer.
you had it the entire time?!
holy shit.
don't drop it rose.
rush her.
it's hers, you schmuck.  look, rose, i... i don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, i know that... but please... think about this a second.
