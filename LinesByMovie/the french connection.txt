sale boulot.

j'ai pas confiance en lui.
sois gentil avec lui.  on ne sait jamais.  il peut te faire travailler à la télévision.
henri c'est gentil d'être venu.  je vous présente mon associé, pierre nicoli.  henri devereaux.

there's about a hundred years' parole time in there night or day.

no - no.
cause if i do.
how's everything?
everything is everything.
how come there's nothing out there? that stuff is all milk.
there's nothing around.  nobody's holding.
i got a name - sal boca, brooklyn.
boca?
b.o.c.a.
doesn't register.
got a wife named angie.
no, nothing.  there's only some talk.
what?
coming in this week, week after. everybody going to get well.
who brings it?
who knows?
where do you want it?
this side.
i'm goin' check on this address in the bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
we're goin' now!  goodbye.
we got information that there's no shit in the street -- it's like a desert full of junkies with a big score coming in to make everybody well.
this could be it, walter.  this candy store guy, putting on a big show in a fancy nightclub with known connections all over him. then on our own, after working the whole day and night, we tail him out to brooklyn and sit on him for a week practically, and who do we come up with?  joel weinstock.  you gotta let us have it.
there are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.
just for mistakes of parking?
no.  many are involved in crimes and confiscated... or just abandoned. this is, as you know, your prime source of scrap metal, m. charnier.
darling, may i have this one?
where are you?
takin' care o' business, honey.
takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
you know i hadda meet some people tonight --
-- well finish all your meetin' people and get back here now -- and bring a pizza with you.
where'm i goinna get a pizza this time o' night?
well try, okay?
i don't know where i'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
sal --
yeah?
don't forget anchovies.
it's beautiful.
it was built in 1917 - and was one of the two heaviest bridges in the world.  the arch is still the largest in the world.
who financed it?
two railroads as part of a connecting railway which provided passage from new england to the south.  it was actually the first railroad through new york city.
why is it called hellgate?
the river at this point is the most dangerous on the east coast.  years ago, hundreds of ships went down here.
if this bridge were in europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
most new yorkers never notice it - most americans have never heard of it.
look how gracefully they conceived that arch.  like a bowstring.  it was built from both ends.  with no support in the middle.  beautiful.
mmm.
alain is the only man i know who can become as enthusiastic about a bridge as he can about a woman.
not any woman, marie.  just one.
i'm afraid the rest of ward's island isn't nearly as romantic - a pollution plant, a hospital, a training school for garbage men and that area over there, where the old cars are kept, prior to being processed for shipment to, among other places, the charnier shipping company, of marseilles, france.
what is that old building?
oh, it's been abandoned for years.
what was it?
it was a crematorium.
for garbage?
for dead bodies.
allo... salvatore...
who's this --
... salvatore?...
twelve o'clock... yes...
yes --
hey, bo.
hiya, jesus.
can you use a new suit for christmans?
whatta you got?
where'd you get this fag shit?
this is what the tough guys are wearin'.  you know i only steal from the best.  it's bonwit teller.
pass.
forty dollars -- was $250.
whyn't you get it dry cleaned and burned.
what about you, doyle?  who's the best fighter you ever seen?
willie mays.
what ya doin' out so late?  hidin' from the cops?
i hear the health department is going to close this joint for selling dirty beer.  i come by to help you carry out your money.
they'll close you down if they ever get a look at those busted-valise broads you run with.
you want some eggs.
why not?
hey, mutch!  you want bacon?
yeah!
where the hell is it?
where the hell do you think it is, potato head?
i got this little chick i'm tryin' to hit on.  she's about 20, 21... i take her to jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... i says, "hey, this is 1971, baby, i'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
strike out, eh?
yeah.  in the late innings.  ya look like a night's sleep wouldn't kill ya.
a piece of ass wouldn't kill me.
when ya go back on?
morning.  sometime.
whyn't ya stretch out on the pool table for a couple hours.  the kid comes in at six will wake ya.  a couple eggs and a beer is cheaper than keepin' a dog around the joint.
popeye.
yeah.
it's cloudy.  open the door.
i can't.
why not?
let yourself in.
what happened to you?
the crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  with my own cuffs.
you got the warrant?
we also got bill mulderig and phil klein.
throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? how good are the warrants?
sixty days.  here.  don't mention it.
you want the red or the white?
pour it in your ear.
i'm sorry, i don't know who you mean.
he got off on six.
we have four rooms and six suites on six.  there's a man in almost every one of them.
there's nobody like that on six.
perhaps he's visiting a guest.
no, i figure he stays here.  where's your registration?
there may be two... no, three who could fit it.
names.
a mr. paul ganapolos, he's here alone.
where from?
des moines.
what's he do?
businessman.  owns a department store in des moines, i think.
mr. and mrs. alain charnier, would be another.  he's in shipping.
yeh?  who else?
and a mr. michael lowenstein, i don't know what he does.
this charnier guy.  he's in shipping?
i think so.  but they're in room 408.  on the fourth floor.
where's he from?
marseilles.

that's in france.
yeah, i know.
the guy's a frog -- i'm pretty sure. also he made me.  stayin' on four but went up to six -- cute.
the other guy's a frog too.  checked in at the edison.  had a hooker sent up.
christ you should o' collared him right there.
who's on him?
what about sal?
we put him to bed for the night.
why don't you do the same, doyle? you look like shit.
look.  my partner and i found this case and i don't want no feds screwing it up.
case?  so far i haven't seen a damn thing.
bill, keep shootin' your mouth off and i'll knock you into the middle of next week.
what am i, a shmuck?  what's the hurry?  he could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the empire state building.
joel, don't jerk me.  i spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.
so whatta you want a badge?  it's your first major league game sal. one thing i learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  you'll never be sorry.
i been damn careful up to now.
which is why your phone lines are tapped and the feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
i'm straight, joel.  they haven't got shit on me.  look, i'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
he could go someplace else with his sixty kilos of heroin and see how easy it is to pull together a half million cash.  he wouldn't find there was any hurry to do this kind of business.
yeah, we got the westbury covered like a tent.
the westbury?  balls.  i got him down at the subway at times square. what the hell's goin' on?  i make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  not a soul awake.
this fella nicoli's got a record in france, walter.  he's wanted for questioning in the murder of a french cop.
i say we keep sittin' on boca.
that's crazy.  you lost the frog in the subway and you blew our cover. if they haven't moved already they're not gonna move now.
walter, i can make this case if the feds will get the hell out of my way.
my ass.  the only reason you're in this is because you've got a big expense account for buying junk and you like to see your picture in the papers.
this is my case.  get these guys off my back and let me handle it.
everything's smooth.  beautiful.  i will need a few more days though, the boys think we oughta cool it for awhile -- make sure there's no heat.
you must take me for an imbecile. why do you think i asked you to meet me in washington?  i haven't spent five minutes in new york city without the company of a gendarme.
look, i'll level with you -- i need a little more time -- i got to shift gears.
are you having trouble raising the half million?
hell no -- my end is covered -- my associates just feel we ought to wait for a more opportune time to make the switch.
it has to be by the end of this week.
look, mr. charnier, you got to be reasonable.
it's your problem.
it's yours too!
are you sure it is dead?
i'm going to put them on the cat.
that's a relief.
i'm afraid they've become a bit... over-cautious.  our american friends.
what happens to the schedule?
we must follow it.
but will they?
i don't know.  boca is scared. he's not strong enough.  he sees policemen in his soup.
he is not wrong.
mmmmm.  that bastard who followed me on the subway, he's the eager one.
there'll be someone else.
what difference does it make? we'll be out of the country friday.
timezit?
four.
same car.
third time around.
a bunch of lousy little spic car thieves.
nothing in there except a new york street map.
tumble it.  one end to the other.
did you pick up the car?
it is waiting for you in the garage.
did they follow you?
i wasn't looking.
henri... i need one more favor from you.  i know i am imposing...
my friend, i am not sure about what is going on -- but for me, i am finished.
not quite -- you are in it whether you like it or not.  the police know you brought the car into the country.  this makes you an accomplice.
calm down -- henri!  you must trust me -- this is an extremely complicated situation to which there is a simple solution if you do exactly what i tell you.  it's worth more money to you.
goodbye.
