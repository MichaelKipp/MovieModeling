think i should put the skateboard in bed with him?
too kinky.
ellie, you know i think it is about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  we can afford it now.
amen to that.  the supermarket's full of assholes.
take my advice, do not buy any...
mike?
what?
my ass if falling.
your what...?
my ass is falling.  it is.
what are you talking about?
i just saw it in the mirror, it does not look like my ass anymore.
get in bed.
what am i gonna do?  i jog, i do the exercises on tv in the morning... gravity...
you got a great ass!  i love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
tomorrow, i start looking for our house... you love me?
you got no idea...
imagine... I am sleepin' with a dt.
claire!
hello, win.
skiddy and kit?  i have not seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape.
they have got two monsters now.  both boys.
and so what is with steinhart?  is it serious?
you did not like him?
looks a little constipated to me.
it is called "solid"... nice to find someone you can count on, win.
it is terrific win.
you still writing the occasional magazine article?
occasionally.
then c'mon.  follow me.  the art's in the basement, you are going to get a privileged peek.
hey mike, out of the bag into the bureau, huh... how do you like it so far?
right behind you, t.j.
who is joey venza?
bad fuckin' news.  even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  but he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  it would cap it for garber if he could bring him in.
are you in charge here?
no, sir...
i asked for the man in charge...
that would be lieutenant garber, and he is very busy upstairs...
do not tell me he is "busy".  i asked for an ambulance for this woman and...
is she injured?
you are not going to talk to anyone without a lawyer.
she is not a suspect, sir, she is a witness.  could i ask you to step outside, please.
no, i will not step outside.
sir, i am just trying to do my job, it is standard procedure to question the witness alone.  help me out here, could you please leave.
i do not really see what that has to do with...
I have never seen anyone killed before.
it is okay... I have never been a detective before either...
i do not know how you did it, but whatever it was, keep doing it.
i just sat and listened.
safe and secure is how we want her. until she i.d.'s venza.
why not patrol?  they would do just as good a job.
when i want your advise, keegan, I will make an appointment.
shit!  a nursemaid!  my first detail, and I am a fuckin' slug!  i got a 'choice' at all.
do it, or look for another profession.  that is a choice i guess.
you in this with me?
yeah!  seniority gets the day shift.
what are we having?
my special, scrambled eggs surprise.
scrambled eggs surprise?
so how did it go?
not great.  I have got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
for how long?
'til they pick up the perp.  seniority gets day shift... you know what that means.
do not start... the only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  i just do not like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
i can still use a gun.
just keep it someplace safe, but handy.
keep what handy?
nothing.
the gun?  it is in the upstairs closet.
how do you know where the gun is?
i know where everything is.
except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere!  I would like to kill the guy who invented those things.
lay back, mack.
lay back, mack!!  what is this "lay back, mack?"  where does he get this?
god!  scrambled eggs surprise?! these are pickles...!  god!
just "lay back, mack"... lay back...
not koontz.
be happy.  he is good at this.
what about when she goes out?
discourage it.  but stay with her if you can't.  call it in first so we can have a car on tail.  she is agreed to travel only with her own driver and limousine... okay, let's check it out.
straight ahead.
hard to find doors in this place.
... just saying you should think twice about it...
... i do not want to talk about it...
... you know, and i know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
claire...
... he killed win... he enjoyed it...
win made his choices, claire.  we all do --
and I am making mine.
you are dealing with a psychopath. he gets out of jail in ten years, or five... or ninety days, and you will be looking over your shoulder for the rest of your life...
what am i supposed to do?!  i saw one of my oldest friends get killed! and i saw who did it!  i can not just -- "let it go away"!!
claire...
you are here 'til what time?
I am relieved at 4:00 a.m.
changing the sparks.  they showed it on tv.  what d'you think?
i think television's a dangerous thing.
it is twenty bucks in the bank.
hey.  the neighbors.
let 'em eat their hearts out.
i read the article.  you did not tell me she was so beautiful.
well, actually, she looks better than that.
okay?
unbelievably handsome.  you look fantastic in a suit.
nice threads dad.
yeah, i think so.
hi.
I am sorry.  I am not sure how this works.  i have to go out... is that all right?
uh...
i have to pick something up before bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
i think, maybe, that is not such a great idea...
lieutenant garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
right.  that is true.
can we go then?
I am supposed to call in.
there is a phone in the car.
do you have another tie?  something more conservative?
oh... yes... i do not have it with me.  it is at home.
what did he say?
he thinks you are being a little careless.  he made the point several times.
you live in manhattan?
queens... you know queens?
my father founded a music school there.  the milton gregory school.
I am supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
nice.  maybe you will stop by... have an aperitif...
are you nervous?
no, ma'am.
would you pick one out, please?
beg pardon?
since you are going to be my escort, you will need a new tie.
put it on my account, please.
i got money.
you can touch me, i will not bite.
not too sure about that.
uh, yeah.  I am a policeman.
ever shot anyone?
yes.
does it make you... hard?
... hard?
erect.  you know, a "boner?"  I would heard that it gives you a boner, to shoot a man.
people think I am stepping out on neil.  we are causing quite a scandal.
hey!  there are crazy people here.
let's get a drink.
ah... i shouldn't... on duty.
I will have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... i must go for a pee.
I will come with you.
i think i can probably do that on my own.
but i got him!  he is in jail! was not that the point...?!
you apprehended him after he gave himself up --
it was not a bad bust.  he gave himself up because he knew i was going to nab him.
anyone who turns himself in makes a good case for bail.
even joey venza?!
he is got a good lawyer, and he made a smart move.  we have got a scared witness and a suspect who proved "good will" by turning himself in.
what about when she identifies him?!
if she identifies him.  where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  venza was meat.  he walked right past you, and now we are the ones playing catch-up!  you better hope she identifies him.
was not your fault.
it was my fault, t.j.  fuck!
the real estate lady left, she could not wait anymore.  what took you?
oh, some shit.
what shit, honey?
you do not want to hear about it.
honey.  you got him.
i do not know that ellie.  he might get out.  garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it is my job to convince her she will not be.
she is got to identify him.
why?
because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  i can not believe you are talking this way mister detective -- i think she is got a lot of guts.
i think -- she is crazy.
I would identify him.
i might stop you.
oh i can see you have had a bad day. we will see the house another time, okay?
no!  no!  I am sorry.  ninety-seven five right?
where did you get the tie?
bought it.
it is not your taste.
what did she say the down payment was?
she did not like the other one, so she picked this one.
she took you shopping for a tie?
i had to follow her to a store.
what is wrong with your paisley tie?
ellie, it was a formal party...
excuse me!  you went to a party with her?
I am her bodyguard, goddamnit...
i know you are her bodyguard.  did she buy it or did you?
she bought it.
why?
i do not know why she bought me a tie! -- she is a generous person -- and she is a nice person -- and i could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
hi.  just checking to see if you are here.
i came on at 8:00.
you all right?
yeah.
I am sorry about what happened.
listen, that was my fault.
i should not have listened to you, i should have followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
if i had known i was going to have company, he was right next to me.  i think he heard me peeing!  i hate that, i am glad he is in jail.
i guess I am supposed to do it in the morning.  identify him.
sooner, the better.
he said he would kill me.
big talk... desperate guy.
right.  how could he do that if he is in jail and they have thrown away the key...?
claire?
hmm...
you would not happen to know what language they speak in india, do you?
urdu and hindi.
yeah, what a woman.
did not do very well, did you?
nope... never finished one yet.  i hate these things.
you were reading my renoir.
how did you know?
you put it back in the wrong place... do you like renoir?
they are kind of fuzzy.
you know why they are like that...? he was myopic... going blind.
no kidding.
so, this could be your last night, huh?
could be, i guess.
want to go out for a drink?  i mean, we are both sitting here, and joey venza's in jail...
yeah, i like that!  where you go, i follow.
you mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
absolutely.  look at this.
that is the dumbest walk i ever saw!
no, no seriously!  there is a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are going to single you out.
and die laughing, because you are walking so stupid!
hey.  this is my business.  do i tell you your business.
okay.  let's just see if a mugger gets me.
... it was like... the minute i saw her... i knew.  she looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
so it was "love".
yeah.  it was.
and "is"...?
yeah.
that is nice.  and you live in queens?  with a child, and a dog...?
no dog.
i saw you with a dog, in my mind.
no dog.
but "nice".
very nice.
what about neil?
you do not like him, do you?
what is to like?
tell it like it is.
you asked.
he is very caring, in his way.  you have not seen him at his best.
you could do better.
I will miss you, mike...
it was nice having you "watch over me"...
yeah.  i liked being around you too... claire.
good night, mike.
sleep good.
coming to bed?
few minutes.  want to catch the news.
should i wait up?  we have got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
I will be right up.
what?
goddamn venza assaulted a taxi driver in the bronx, thirteen months ago.  it is coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
mike, take it easy...
take it easy!  i set her up.  i saw it coming.
it is not your fault.  mike, please get off the case.
it is my fault!  I am responsible for her!
did you hear what i said?
did you hear what i said?!!
we are not going to the game, are we mom?
sure we are, let's go!
claire?
what do you want?
open the door, will you?
i can not open it.
it is just me.  i want to talk to you.  let me in...
you put me life in danger.
no, you will be safe.  we are going to pick him up again...
and then what?  I will never be safe. I will have to leave the country!  you can not protect me, and you can not keep him in jail!  and you knew that all the goddamn time!
you told me I am safe?  I am going for a walk in the park.
claire, will you calm down?
I am perfectly calm, I am a normal human being.  I am going for a walk in the park.
claire...!
stop, will you?!
let go!
stop being nuts!
i trusted you!  i thought you cared about me?!
i do care about you!
more bullshit!  more bullshit!  what kind of odds are they giving me?  there must be some kind of office pool.  one month?  a couple of days?
I am sorry.  i know i heard noises... the detective's wife...
i want you and tommy to stay with my mother.
c'mon, do not make an issue of it. do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
d'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
what was that?
you heard me.
jesus, mike, somebody is been feeding you a line of crap.
what are you talking about --
I am talking about I have been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it is vulgar!
yeah.
they called here after you left...
she is okay.  everything's okay...
i do not know you...
this is me, mike.  there is nothing else...
you do not wash your clothes at the boulevard laundromat... you do not pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this?  a fuckin' joke?
okay, then let's make it easy.  it was a mistake.  do not make me feel guilty now that it is over, let's forget about it.
you got to get another tour.  we are gettin' too old for this.
I am sorry.
I am not saying it is your fault.
what did you do tonight?
i watched tv.
what did you watch?
i do not remember michael, go to sleep.  you do not have to make conversation with me.
hey, we qualify for the senior citizens early-bird special... did you see tommy today?  he misses you...
well.  this'll be over soon. venza's such a nut job, we are bound to pick him up soon.
I would like you to switch to the day shift, mike.  to be home for dinner. helen insists that t.j. be home for dinner... that is why he is on the morning shift.
well, t.j.'s... seniority... and all.  I will talk to garber about it.
i already did.  i mean, i talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
you talked to his wife?
my wife talks to his wife about what shift I am going to take?
what is the difference?
let me drive...
get away from me... get away!  she means that much to you, you stay with her.  but you come back, you come back for me.  not for tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
el?  I am sorry.  i do love you.  and you are a lady.  i have so much respect...
tell me I am dreamin'.
i just gotta talk to her, t.j.
you told her?
not exactly.
what do you want to do?
i do not know.
they are operating on him.  he is still alive.
i heard.
i heard a lot... anything you want to deny, mike?
it should have been me...
I am going to visit my sister for a few days.  I would like you to get your stuff out.
what about tommy?
he will live through it.  they all live through it.  what a world, huh?
was it venza?  did you get him?
no.
you do not want to know.
oh, i do want to know.  i tried to reach you at the precinct.
I have moved into scotty's... good news about t.j., though.  looks like that tough son of a gun is going to pull through.
oh god, that is great!
are you okay?
oh, I am fine.  they have replaced you with quite an entourage.  it is a regular "marching band".  you should see me on the street, you would think i was the first lady --
I am taking them all out to queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  there is an event at my father's school... an anniversary... i thought maybe you could come...
oh that thing in queens.
I am going away after that, the next morning.
where?
pretty far.  I am told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it is tapped... they think it is best, safer, if i go away, at least till venza's found.
when can i see you?
i do not know.  garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
oh yeah.  when is it?  this thing in queens.
tomorrow night.  can you come?
i do not know.  it would not be very smart.
listen, you are right.  do not do it. I will just... send you an address, okay?
claire...
no really, it is okay, I have got to go. I am expecting some calls.  I will be fine, really.
I will think about wednesday.
how are things going, pal?
okay, i guess.
how about dinner tonight?
mom and i got plans.
what "plans?"  you and mom got "plans?"
she is taking singing lessons.
she is what?
she met some friend of aunt millie's who works for a record company.  he thinks she is got a great voice.
what!  what kind of pathetic line is that?
we are going to pass the street.
you coming in?
no, I am not coming in.  and if you would rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
we are not going to a singing lesson, she is just going to start taking singing lessons.
so, what are you doing tonight?
shooting.
shooting?
yeah.  she says we got to get used to being alone in this neighborhood.  'bye, dad.
tommy!  the guy's a sleaze-bag.  she can not sing.
i do not think she can sing, either.
take care, pal.
mom, what is going to happen with you and dad?
i do not know tommy.
hey, can we go to mcdonald's?
absolutely.
hello, claire.  how extraordinary that you came.
it was something my father always liked me to do.
you are planning to speak?
not if you do not want me to.
well, of course, we would be... honored...
just putting in an appearance then.
what a memory.
do you dance?
do you?
pretty bad.
let's do it.
they guys treatin' you all right?
yeah.
I have been doing a lot of thinking.
i know.
it would not work.
i know.
I would miss my life...
... do not explain.
how long you going away for?
long enough.
"for"...?
"to"... forget about you.
I will have to pack a lot of clothes.
yeah...
at my house...!
call a cruiser!
... mike.
it is venza.  he wants you.  you, for ellie and tommy.
let's go.  we are takin' her home!  move it!  get the cars!
koontz!  i need you guys!
we will call swat.  we will get the locals.  throw it!
no, i need'm now!
no one-seventeen, they will fuck it up!  he told me not to tell anybody, to bring claire and come alone!  he will not wait, he knows I am two minutes away!  koontz, please!
i can not do it, you know that... he is not going to allow it anyway, mike.  no way is he going to let anybody walk out of that house alive, who can finger him.
you made a terrible mistake, keegan. you did not do what i said.
that is right, you are going to do what i say.  joey.  i want to help you out of this.
you should'a brought the girl.
i brought the girl.  she is outside.
hold it...!
I will prove it!
claire!
mike...?
how do i know that is her?
I will bring her in.  you let them go, and I will bring her in.
why should she come in?
she trusts me.  she will do what i say.
bullshit!  prove it.
koontz!  let her come in!  claire! it is pitch dark in here!  you are going to have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall.  then stand at the door so we can see you. we want to see your face and we will not be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
i want your guarantee they will be turned loose when she opens the front door.
i get my hostage first.  no one's turned loose until i say so.
let my kid go.
I am not lettin' no one go.
get that gun away from his head, or I will keep her from coming in!  put the gun on me, he can not hurt you! he is tied up!  put him under the table!
do not you fuckin' give orders to me...
put him under the table or I will stop her from coming in.
under the table.
I will take his place, all right?  put the gun to my head.
watch your step!
what the fuck you doin'?!
tommy...!
I am all right.
ellie...
I am all right.
everyone's all right...?
yeah.  it is all over.
so.
so.
you still going away?
i do not know...
you do not have to, now.
i think it is probably still a good idea.
I will miss you, mike.
listen, i'll... see you again.
i like your coat.
you have a weakness for lady cops.
i do.
say goodbye, mike.
you take care.
what do you think?  any chance?  there is nothin' else I am any good at, but this.
call me next week.  we will talk about it.
he does not want to sleep here.  neither do i.  it is not my house anymore.
me neither.
