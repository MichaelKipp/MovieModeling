the space shuttle has landed!
hold still, damn it!
what're you doing later?
taking my boyfriend to the airport.
i thought i was your boyfriend.
i don't talk that way.
remember, skiers stay up longer.
shut up, tod!  be serious!
i am serious.
watch it, i'm gonna fall.  i'm gonna go!
balance, kelly.  bal-lance!
thank you.
want another one?
well, not much longer to go.
what is it, 97 days?
till this opens, not our wedding.
hope i make it through both.
you will.  i'll see to it.
look, kathryn.  they're jealous.
they're acting very strange suddenly.
pre-opening jitters.
i guess.
what kind of trouble?
it's not closing, mike.
that's impossible.
i know.  but we show it's not closing.
okay, okay... we'll get someone on it.
damn it.  i can't understand!  i gotta go, hon.
don't forget you have your brother.
yeah.
see you later.
bring the crane over.  come down. easy down.
hey.
hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
calvin said it was all right.
yeah, well i didn't!
well, we're not going to hurt it, old boy.  i say, love, is flipper ready to go?
go where?
on the telly.  we're to film him for the evening news.
nobody told me.
i just did.  can you make them do tricks?
they're not tricks.  they're behavior patterns.
fine.  have them do some.
i don't know.  they're nervous and skittish right now.
yes, aren't we all.
that macho pompous english --
don't let him get you.  just continue your patterns and pretend he's not around.
my imagination isn't that good.
honey, i gotta go.
okay, bye.
make sure you put this back.
aww, can't i keep it?
okay now.  have flipper flip or something.
make this quick!
ahhh, ahhh...
now what?
gotta sneeze.
don't you dare.
can't help it... ahh...
it's no use.  they won't come into the lagoon.
well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
wait a minute.  these aren't kangaroos, mr. hutton.  they're dolphins.
i thought they were clever.
i can have them walk backwards.
no, no.  that won't do.
i told you, something's upset them.
well, i have to get this into the networks.  if you can't do it, you can't do it, that's all.
i'm sorry.
well, we'll just try again, dear. keep working on it.  maybe you'll get it one of these years.  pack up, boys.  flipper's a flop.
you called, doctor?
everything's going wrong.  i'm having more trouble with bobby than i ever have before.  i can't get him to respond.
how come?
i don't know.  i can't understand it.  something's bothering them.
and what else is bothering you?
... hutton.  he really pisses me off.
yeah, you really don't like him.
i don't like what he does.
it's his work.
he doesn't need the money.  he inherited a fortune.  he kills for kicks.  tv battles between non-predator fish and divers. the diver always wins.
okay, forget him now.  i'm going to pick up sean.  take a ride?
i can't leave now.  we taking sean out?
sure.  want to try that new italian place?
no, you don't need all that starch.  you're getting too fat.
not enough loving.
get out of here!
it's miller time!
you buying?
sure am.
coming with us?  overman's buying.
you see the three-quarter socket?
yeah.  down there.
shit.
hey, what's goin' on, little brother!
damn!  you sonuvabitch!  look at you!
look great, don't i?
got a job for me?
yeah, we'll find something for you.  shoveling shark shit or something.
sharks???
in a restaurant.  you sit there and they swim around you.
... i'll go to mcdonalds.
how'd you do in school?
great.  i got one b, two c's, and eight incompletes.
hey, i'm proud of you, kid.
so was dad.
took it this morning.
he needs a haircut.
yeah, right.
how is he?  still fighting crime?
last week he broke up a major counterfeiting ring.  gang of kids were using slugs in the pac-man games.
big bust!  he confiscate their water pistols?
booked them all at baskin- robbins.
that's dad...
he taught us good, though, didn't he, sean?  we were lucky to grow up the way we did.
who's grown up?
gee, it's good to see you!
i want to see kathryn.
just find your own.  like dad says, there's plenty of fish in the sea.
give me a ride?
sure.
'preciate it.
so, you just get here?
yeah, from boston.
i was seeing this guy off.  he flew in from dallas.  wants to marry me.  he's okay, but texans are so possessive.
massachussettans aren't.
'course they're also so rich.
... massachussettans aren't.
how long you staying?
i don't know, it depends.
you like florida?
i haven't seen that much, but so far it looks great.
well, wait till you see the rest.
you gonna work at the kingdom?
depends on big brother.
i'm a water-skier.
are you really?
sure am.
that's too bad.  i don't like water.  i don't like being around in.  i never go in it.
how come?
goes back to when i was a kid. mike's okay, he's gotten over his fears, but i haven't.  i can't even drink it.
come on, let's go.
something wrong?
you know overman?
musclehead?
he's missing.
hope with none of my girl friends.
kelly, could you look after sean for a while?  show him around for me?
sure.  no problem.
thanks.
okay, you two, have a good life without me.  i gotta go.
don't hurry back.
i don't understand.  overman's too good a diver to disappear.
have you checked the bars?  the guy's irresponsible;  he's done this before.
i'll need more men to look.
can't help you, mike.  don't have the manpower.
we're going to have to cover the entire lagoon.
i know, but you're just going to have to find another way.  so you better start.
i think they'll come out now.
they still seem nervous.
i know.
they're coming with us?
we play hide and seek all the time.  they find a lot of things.
where's the rubber band?
look, michael... you don't have to come.
i don't have a choice.
what do i do now?
take a deep breath and hold it.
that's cute, kathryn.  real cute.
just put your mask on.
honey... you all right?
no.
are you scared?
yes.
damn it!
hi, baby.
baby goddamn scared me to death!
they just wanted to say hello.
... friggin' fish.
let's head to the gate and work our way back.
that's a lot of ground to cover.
i know, i built it.  i've just never seen it this way.
well, i needed a cold shower.
come on!  check this out!
it's romantic down here.
oh, yeah.  very.
you know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
let's not talk about that now, okay?
this is where to be.  high and dry.
and alone.
what's wrong?
nothing.
... if nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
... electrical connection malfunctioning.
you sound like houston mission control.  what the hell does it mean?
that we swim.
swim where?  out there?  oh, no, forget it, not me!  you go, i'm staying.
michael, the sub's dead.
yeah, and so will i be if i start swimming in that blackass jungle.
okay, stay.  we'll come back for you.
where are you going?
up.
and leave me down here???
make up your mind.
what mind?  if i had a mind, i'd never have let you talk me into this.
i talked you into this?
i'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
are you coming...?
no, i don't want to leave now. i'm having too good a time... of course i'm coming!  you'd think you're gonna leave me?
you would, wouldn't you?  i'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care.
get your reserve bottle and let's go.
you all right?
i think so.  i'm not sure... are you?
i'm okay.
michael...
it's all right, baby.  we're safe...
how the hell did it get in here?
god, they're horrible.  i hate them.  did you see its eyes?  how black they are?  the look in them?
don't think about it.  it's over.
it's never over...  here comes another six years of bad dreams.
what you're saying is we have a great white shark in the lagoon.
and a missing man.
unhappy combination.  most likely one's inside the other.
sharks are man-biters, mister hutton.  not man-eaters --
that's a load of codswopple.  a great white doesn't fear man.  it doesn't fear beast.  it's an orgy of food and blood.
i think we can capture it.  i'd like to try.
that's preposterous!
go on, doctor.
no one's ever caught a great white except indirectly in fishing nets. i want to dart it and keep it alive.
it would make a marvelous attraction;  the only great white in captivity.
i can get it.
you can get killed!
i've handled sharks before. bigger than this one.
calvin, let me go down there and kill the bastard.
no!
it'll chop up half a million dollars of your tropical fish in two minutes.
calvin, i insist i be allowed to capture it!
three hundred million years of evolution have created the greatest butcher the world's ever known.
it's one of the world's greatest creatures.
a shark could have a hundred embryos in its sack.  you know how many are born?  maybe five. they eat each other before birth! they're born killers!
the only great white in captivity, calvin.  all those people standing in line...
i will.
well, then i'm going to film it.
like hell!
make a lovely item for "good morning, america"
absolutely.  good idea.
with those camera lights and...
he's going with you, doctor.
no, it will be too much distraction.  i don't want that many people in the water.  i'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
and philip will be there to film it.  now that's the end of it!
i want that shark alive.
so do i, love.
you're going down there again?
yes.
after what happened to us?
i know i can capture it.
kathryn, you're crazy.  really crazy.  a suicidal maniac.
we'll shoot this with an .18, boys.
that bugger moves fast.
give me a 400-foot magazine;  we may be down there for a while.
i wouldn't mind going down with her.
she is a lovely bit of crumpet at that.
aren't you suiting up, mate?
no.
well, don't worry about your fiancee.  we'll watch over her.
she can take care of herself. she doesn't need you.
never know down there.  helps to have a friend, sometimes.
how many sharks have you killed?
me?  i don't know.  twenty, thirty.  i love them, think they're the greatest.
oh, yeah.  really nice.  who's your designer?  sassoon shark?
i got it on sale.  a real steel.
here.
what's that?
bracelets.
fine piece of engineering.
should protect you a little, from the compression.  if that thing gets ahold of you.
thank you.
kathryn...
yes?
let us know as soon as you have anything.
right, mike.
wouldn't this whole thing be a little safer in the daytime?
it's easier to lure sharks at night.
why?  'cause they're hungrier?
you look like an orange worm.
shark bait.  draws them over for closeups.
what in hell is that?
lunch for whitey.  something to munch on in case things get dicey.
we're taking that shark alive!
let's hope he knows that.
i know it and i will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
why?
because i don't trust you, that's why.
you set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.
precisely.
i insist you get rid of that bomb.
afraid i can't do that.
you're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
look, doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. it's a torpedo of muscle. murderous expertise!  i've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves!  don't be so concerned about them.  worry about yourself.
we see him, mike.  between the stadium and the ski show island.
all right, hit those lights too.
change your mind?
no.
you amaze me.  i'm more scared than you.
no, you're not.
i can use a shot of what he's got.
... me, too.
after this has opened, when everything's settled down, you and i are going away.  just the two of us.  no dolphins, no sharks, no whales, no penguins. just you and me.
sounds wonderful.
we'll go to palm springs, death valley, arizona desert, anyplace where there's no water.
we're ready for you.
i have to walk him till the drug wears off.
you want me to stay?
get some sleep.  and tell sean i'm sorry.
sean, that's right...
watch it, brody.  you're ruining the shot.
kind of dull in there for you, isn't it?  why don't you throw in another shark?
he's a young one.
and big for his age.
sean.  sean, where are you?
someone's looking for you.
why don't you take a rest, brian?
i'm only walking him.  you caught him.  you have to be exhausted.
go on, you're tired.
no, i'm fine, thanks.
how's sleeping beauty?
still sleeping.
kiss him, maybe he'll turn into a frog.
should be coming out of it soon.
just watch it when he does.
could be a new dance...  walking the shark.
thanks for helping.
not at all.
why are you?
i like it when they wake up.
so do i.  but for different reasons.
and i like you.
you were quite daring in capturing him.  very skillful indeed.
skillful?  i missed my first shot.
some miss all their shots.
somebody could have gotten hurt.
that's what life is, doctor. full of chances to hurt yourself, or somebody else.
you're a strange man, mr. hutton.
philip.
before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
that's because i am the shark.
we're all from the sea, mr. hutton. our destiny is linked to the fate of the oceans.  by continuing to destroy fish, man destroys himself.
the grenade's just to intimidate whitey.  he knows i have it, so he watches out.  same is true when i film lions, tigers, rhinos...
i think that you and i are natural enemies.
and here i thought i was charming you.
hello.  i think his nap's over.
get ready to go.
believe me, i am.
brian, he's coming around!
well, doctor.  you've got your shark.
thanks to you.
finally.
how's your patient?
recovering nicely.
me, too.
mmmm... you smell good.
you don't.
it's my new perfume.  great white, the man-eater.
you want to show this?
absolutely.  the audience will stain their drawers.  i did.
they said you'd be here.
what's up?
i need more pressure in the shark tank.
okay.
i want to make sure the white is getting enough flow.  would you do that for me?
sure.  let's go.
no, we'll go through here.
... mean through the tubes?
yes.  it's faster.
no,  i'm not going through there.
michael, come on, don't be silly. this is the quickest way.  you're not going to walk all the way around?
i'm not going to walk through that shark arcade.
they're not going to hurt you. they're encased in plastic.
i don't want to see them, kathryn.
michael, i don't have time. please!  it's time you dealt with this and got over it.  now come on!
calvin wants me to move the white for tomorrow.
... he ought to put him in here.
it's too soon to move him.
so tell calvin.
i did.  he wants it on exhibit.
well, that's why you got it.
honey, what is it?
hydrophobia...
michael, take deep breaths.
i have to get out of here.
come on.
i can't take water, kathryn.
yes, you can.
i can't!  my dad had it, and i don't know if you can inherit it or what, but i got it, and i hate it.  i can't stand it!
back, kelly.  lean back!
ohhhhh shhhhiiiit.
when did this happen?
ten minutes ago.
it hasn't adjusted.
get the hose!  we've got to force more water through the gills and oxygenate him!
i knew it;  it's my fault.  we moved it too soon.
don't blame yourself.
i should have never listened to calvin.
no one's ever done it before. it was a good try...
not good enough.
we got it to live for ten hours. that's some kind of record.
don't feel bad.
okay... have them get it out of the tank.
mike, this is fantastic.  i mean, you're responsible for building all this.  what a job you've done! maybe i'll quit school and come down here and work with you. brody brothers construction. we've always wanted to do that together.  boat building.
it's not that easy.  worked construction every summer to get through school.  three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  finish school first, sean.  then make up your mind.  if you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
you and kathryn gonna stay here?
this company's expanding.  they got parks in texas, ohio, california.  i think i'm gonna be going to waco.
well, dad asked me to ask you this, about the wedding.  is there any chance you and kathryn will get married in amity?
tell dad we're getting married in las vegas.  in one of those chapels.  he can meet us there.
yeah, he'll really go for that.
it's all up to kathryn.  amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
she still talking to you?
we're in love.
sure.
no, really.  i've never met anyone like her before.  this is it.
yeah, right.  that's what you said about janet, and beth, and barbara --
puppy love.  this time it's real! we can have a double wedding.
you were great out there!
did you see me?!  wasn't i terrific?
as always.
hi, mike.
how you doing, kelly?
i'm neo-senephrened out.  think i'm catching a cold.
better than catching sean's herpes.
herpes?
why you sonuvabitch...
sean, do you have herpes?
no.  of course not.  don't listen to him.  he's - he's...  ... my brother.
besides that.
i don't know, what else is there?
i know!  we can take the gondola ride!
the one that goes underwater?
yes, it's great!
no, kelly, i don't want to...
come on, it's fun!
not for me.  i don't go in the water, remember?
you're not in the water.  you're in a gondola.
no, think of something else.
sean, this is ridiculous.  you're acting very immature.
i'm not acting!  i don't want to go in it, okay?
did you see that?
what?
on monitor three.  was a glimpse of something.
that?
yes, there is goes.
it's disappeared.
your friend overman picked a hell of a time to come back.
yeah, poor bastard.
i lost a good cameraman in australia last year.  a great white chopped him in half with one bite.
hey, i don't want to hear.
that's how they do it, you know. seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely.  teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
buzz off.
i will, old boy, tomorrow.  our work is done here.  just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
yeah?  well, in that case, have a drink.
thanks.  bullshot.
so where you go off to, hutton? some expedition in new guinea or outer mongolia?
no, south georgia.
what the hell's there?
polar bears.
polar bears in georgia???
south georgia, antarctica.
oh...
the world's southern most reaches.
how come you're so brave with all this stuff?
tradition.  royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries.  dates back to the crusades and king richard.  what i was born to do.
yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
reach for the limit i always say.
i'll remember that, my lordship.
put it under your pillow and sleep on it and the tooth fairy will --
it's a shark's tooth!
so?
it was removed from charlie overman's body.
what's the big deal?  a shark got overman, and we got the shark.
that's just it, michael.  we don't!
what do you mean, we don't?
this tooth is from another shark. a shark that could be 30 feet long!
thirty feet???
actually, thirty-five is probably more accurate.
that's impossible.  if it's that big, why hasn't anybody seen it? huh?  tell me that.  it's like not seeing the goodyear blimp in a swimming pool.
that's what i've come to ask you. is there any large place that has a strong current of water flowing?
i don't understand.
sharks have to keep moving.  they can never stop or they'll suffocate. if water isn't always flowing through them, they'll die.
is there such a place?  a cave or something with such a flow?
what did you just say before? about water flowing through them?
that's why they're always moving. they have to have it.
you wanted to know about a cave?
filter system number four.  is it large enough?
it's large enough...
how far away is filter number four?
five hundred yards.
you have a man near it?
somebody better get down there!
it's all controlled from the control room.
i've heard of a white that big, in australia...
how'd it get in here?!
he's big as a bloody bus!
the water ski show!  we have to get them out!
come on!
you two go!  i'll call calvin!
isn't this fun!
can hardly wait to do it again.
told you you'd like it.
now what's this do?
goes up.
no...  it can't be.
what, hon?
let's go, let's go!
it's okay, sean.
take it up.
he's diving!
take it up!
sean!
how is he?
couple of fractures, lacerations. they say he's gonna be all right.
... i have to go, honey.  phillip and i are going down together to kill the shark.
... okay.
we can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
she, mister hutton.
he.  she.  let's blow the bitch up!
after all, that's how you catch fish, isn't it?
you could also try a bamboo pole and a worm.
what's your plan, brody?
it's easy.  put a net on the derrick.  put the net in the water by the intake passage. turn off the intake passage. shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
a piece of pie on sunday.
the net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
that's right.
who's going to do it?
me.
michael, you're not going down there.
i am.  you're not.
but you --
it's a construction job.  i'm the only one that can do it.
i'll go with you.
no way.
i'll stay out of your way.  i won't interfere.
i'm sure you won't.  but you're going to have to wait till we come up.  then you can film all you want.
michael, you don't have to go down there.
i want that shark, kathryn.
you don't have to prove anything.
only to myself.
are you okay?
i'm  fine.
he's big, hutton.  you never saw anything so big.  watch yourself.
always do.
