hey, you guys are milking that job.
that is cause we love freezin' our butts off out here sooo much, boss.
bud!  hippy's on the bitch-box.  it is a call from topside.  that new company man.
kirkhill?  that guy does not know his butt from a rathole.  hey, perry!
what is goin' on, boss?
folks, I have just been told to shut down the hole and prepare to move the rig.
she-hit.
we are being asked to cooperate in a matter of national security.  now you know exactly as much as i do.  so just get your gear off and get up to control.  there is some kind of briefing in ten minutes.
i can not believe you let them do this!
hi, lins.  i thought you were in houston.
i was, but i managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here.  only here is not where i left it, is it, bud?
was not up to me.
we were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work.  we had over seven thousand feet of hole down for chrissake.  i can not believe you let them grab my rig!
your rig?
my rig.  i designed the damn thing.
yup, a benthic petroleum paid for it.  so as long as they are hold the pink slip, i go where they tell me.
you wimp.  i had a lot riding on this.  they bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
I am switching off now.
virgil, you wiener!  you never could stand up to fight.  you--
virgil?
god, i hate that bitch.
yeah, well you never should have married her then.
lady, we better fish or cut bait.
just hold your water, okay?  so kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
deepcore, deepcore... this is cab three on final approach.
gotcha, cab three.  who is that?  that you, lindsey?
howdy, y'all.  hey, lindsey!  I will be damned! you should not be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
could not stay away.  you running mixture for us? good.  could not ask for better.
okay, here we go.  start equalizing, y'all.
get comfortable.  the bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  the worse news is it is going to take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
we have been fully briefed, mrs. brigman.
do not call me that, okay... i hate that.  alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of hpns...
high-pressure nervous syndrome.  muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
very good.  about one person in twenty just can not handle it.  they go buggo.  they are no way to predict who is susceptible, so stay alert.
look, we have all made chamber runs to this depth. we are checked out.
oh... chamber runs.  uh huh, that is good.  well, hey... you guys know any songs?
those guys am not so tough.  i fought plenty of guys tougher'n them.
now we get to hear about how he used to be a contender.
well, well.  mrs. brigman.
not for long.
you never did like being called that, did you?
not even when it meant something.  is that one night up in flatbed?
who else?
i can not believe you were dumb enough to come down.  now you are stuck here for the storm... dumb, hot-rod... dumb.
look, i did not come down here to fight.
you need me.  nobody knows the systems on this rig better than i do.  what is something was to go wrong after the explorer clears off?  what would have you done?
wow, you are right!  us poor dumb old boys might have had to think for ourselves.  coulda been a disaster.
you wanna know what i think?
not particularly.  jeez, look where this is set! morons.
i think you were worried about me.
that must be it.
no, i think you were.  come on, admit it.
i was worried about the rig.  I have got over four years invested in this project.
oh, yeah, right... and you only had three years with me.
what are you still wearing that for?
i do not know.  divorce am not final.  forgot to take it off.
i have not worn mine in months.
yeah, what's-his-name would not like it.  the suit.
do you always have to call him that?  the suit? it makes you sound like such a hick.  his name is michael.
so what about "michael" then... mr. brooks brothers... mr. bmw.  you still seeing him?
no, i have not seen him in a few weeks.
what happened?
bud, why are you doing this?  it is not part of you life any more.
I will tell you what happened... you woke up one day and realized the guy never made you laugh.
you are right, bud.  it was just that simple. are not you clever?  you should get your own show... ask dr. bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.
hippy, you pussy.
what good's the money if your dick drops off in six months?
we will take reading as we go.  if the reactor's breached or the warheads have released radioactive debris, we will back away.  simple.
okay... hippy's not going... mcwhirter, you can run little geek.
look, it is three am.  these guys are running on bad coffee and four hours sleep.  you better start cutting them some slack.
i can not afford slack, brigman.
hey, you come on my rig, you do not talk to me, you start ordering my guys around.  it will not work.  you got to know how to handle these people... we have a certain way of doing things here.
I am not interested in your way of doing things. just get your team ready to dive.
fluid breathing system.  we just got them.  we use it if we need to go really deep.
how deep?
deep.  it is classified... you know.  anyway, you breathe liquid, so you can not be compressed. pressure does not get to you.
hey!
check this out.
cab three, check.  right behind you.
what is you depth, cab three?
1840... 50... 60... 70...
going over the wall.  coming to bearing 065. everybody stay tight and in sight.
okay so far.
how deep's the drop-off here?
cab one, do you see it yet?
the magnetometer is pegged.  side-scan is showing a big return, but i do not see anything yet.  are you sure you got the depth right on this?
cab one, radiation readings?
neutron counter's not showing very much.
wilhite, anything?
copy that, continuing forward.  you just want me to get shots of everything, right?
roger, document as much as you can, but keep moving.  we are on a tight timeline.
copy that.
just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
check.  then i just hang with these guys, right?
stand by on the rov.
perry, stand by on the rov.  sorry about this, little buddy.  better you than me, know what i mean?
radiation is nominal.  the warheads must still be intact.
how many are there?
24 trident missiles.  eight mirvs per missile.
that is 192 warheads... and how powerful are they?
getting a reading?
it is twitching but it is below the line you said was safe.
we will go in through that large breach.
let's go, guys.
how you guys doing?
I am alright, I am dealing.
triple time sounds like a lotta money, bud.  it ain't.  I am sorry...
we are here now.  let's get her done.
where are we?
missile compartment.  those are the launch tubes.
lord almighty.
hey, you okay?
deep and slow, big guy.  deep and slow.  just breathe easy.
i... they are all dead, bud.  they are all dead. i thought... some of them... you know...
I am taking you back out.
no!  I am okay now.  i just don't... i can not go any further in.
okay, jammer.  no problem.  you stay right here. i have to go there to the end... you will see my lights.  we will stay in voice contact.  just hold onto the rope.  five more minutes.  okay?
yeah, okay.  okay.
he is convulsing!
it is his mixture!  too much oxygen!
you got it?!  you got it?
yeah, yeah... yeah.  it is turning.
did you get anything on the cameras.  video or anything?
no.  look, forget it.  i do not want to talk about it.
fine.  be that way.
i do not know what i saw.  okay?  coffey wants to call it a russian submersible, fine.  it is a russian submersible.  no problem.
but you think it is something else.  what?  one of ours?
no.
whose then?  lindsey?  talk to me...
jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
his mixture got screwed up.  he panicked and pranged his regulator.
but what did he see that made him panic?
what do you think he saw?
i do not know.  i do not know!
quiet!  quiet!
turn it up, bozo.
what is the matter with you?
now we are right in the middle of this big-time international incident.  like the cuban missile crisis or something.
figured that out for yourself, did you?
we got russian subs creeping around.  shit! something goes wrong they could say anything happened down here, man.  give our folks medals, know what i mean?
hippy, just relax.  you are making the women nervous.
cute, virgil.
no, i mean it.  those seals are not telling us diddly.  something is going on.
hippy, you think everything's a conspiracy.
everything is.
goddamnit!  d'you tell him we need it right now?
i told him we had to get the umbilical unhooked asap.
coffey, we are a little pressed for time.
monk, schoenick... secure the package.
this am not no drill, slick.  make me proud.
piece of cake, baby.
benthic explorer, benthic explorer.  do you read, over?  this is deepcore--
forget it, sonny.  they are gone.
did you find wilhite?
no.
what is the scoop, ace?
i can get power to this module and sub-bay if i remote these busses.  I have got to get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.
need some help?
thanks.  no, i can handle it.  bud... there will not be enough to run the heaters.  in a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
what about o-2?
brace yourself.  we have got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we are not using.
the storm's going to last longer than 12 hours.
i can extend that.  there is some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module.  I will have to go outside to tie onto them.
hey, lins...  I am glad your here.
yeah?  well I am not.
right through the brainpan.  deader'n dogshit, boss.
where are you?
that is perry.
that is it then.  finler, mcwhirter, dietz, and perry.  jesus.
do we just leave him there?
yeah, for now.  our first priority's to get something to breathe.
cat, you tie onto this manifold.  there is some tanks on the other side; I am going to go check them out.
you watch yourself.
gimme a three-eighths socket on a long extension.  so there you were--
there we were, side by side, on the same ship, for two months.  I am tool-pusher and we are testing this automated derrick of hers.  so, we get back on the beach and... we are living together.
does not mean you had to marry her.
we were due to go back out on the same ship. six months of tests.  if you were married you got a state-room.  otherwise it was bunks.
okay, good reason.  then what?
it was alright for a while, you know.  but then she got promoted to project engineer on this thing, couple years ago.
she went front-office on you.  tighten that for me, right there.  that is it.
well, you know lindsey, too damn aggressive-- son of a--!!
you better not say you missed that.
missed what?
nice shot, lins.
what is that?  you drop your dive light?
come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  you can see how it is kind of zigging around.
if you say so.  it could be anything.
I am telling you what is there.  you are just not hearing.  the impulses somehow are not getting from you ears to your brainpan.  there is something down there.  something not... us.
you all could be more specific.
not us.  not human.  get it?  something non- human, but intelligent...
a non-terrestrial intelligence.
non-terrestrial intelligence.  ntis.  yeah, i like that better then ufos.  although that works too... underwater flying objects.
are we talkin' little space friend here?
right on!  hot rods of the gods.  right, lins? hey, no really!  it could be ntis.  the cia has known about them for years.  they abduct people all the time.  there was this woman i knew in albuquerque who--
jesus, lindsey--
bud, something really important is happening here.
look.  I am just trying to hold this situation together.  i can not allow you to cause this kind of hysteria--
who is hysterical?  nobody's hysterical!
all I am saying is when you are hanging on by your fingernails, you do not go waving you arms around.
i saw something!  I am not going to go back there and say i did not see it when i did.  I am sorry.
god, you are the most stubborn woman i ever knew.
i need you to believe me, bud.  look at me.  do i seem stressed out?  any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
no.
bud, this is me, lindsey.  okay?  you know me better than anybody in the world.  now watch my lips... i saw these things.  i touched one of them.  and it was not some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided.  it was the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.
it was a machine, but it seems almost alive. like a... dance of light.  bud, you have to trust me... please.  i do not think they mean us harm.  i do not know how i know that, it is just a feeling.
how can i go on a feeling?  you think coffey's going to go on you 'feeling'?
we all see what we want to see... coffey looks and he sees russians, he sees hate and fear. bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.
i want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  we need early warning if the soviet craft try another incursion.
gimme a break!  coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  trust me... they are not speaking russian.
'fish'?
yuh?
take the first watch in sonar.  hippy, you handle the exterior surveillance.  one night, see if you can get that transmitter working for me, okay?
come on, man.  what else could it be?
why bring it here?
it is got to be, like, an emergency plan to keep it away from the russians... hotwire one of the nukes with some kinda detonator, put it back in the sub, and fry the whole thing, slicker'n snot. oh, uh... hi, lins.
look, goddamnit, if you will not do something about it, i will.
lindsey!  wait a second--
you have got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig!  with everything that is been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here?  does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
you do not need to know the details of this mission... you are better off if you don't.
you are right... i don't.  i just need to know that this thing is out of here!  you hear me, roger ramjet?
mrs. brigman, you are becoming a serious impediment to this mission.  i believe the stress is affecting you.  escort her to quarters and have monk prepare a tranquilizer.
you dumb jarhead motherf--
chill out, lindsey!!
lins, stay away from that guy.  i mean it.
yeah.  the dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
he is got the shakes?
look, the guy's operating on his own, cut off from chain of command.  he is exhibiting symptoms of pressure-induced psychosis.  and he is got a nuclear weapon.  so, as a personal favor to me... will you put your tongue in neutral for a while?
look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
well, yeah, but the tether off it am not going to be fancy.  when he gets down there he will just sit, like a dumb-shit.  unless something wanders through view of the camera, you will get nada.
let's go for it.  we could get lucky.
no.  just you and me.  we get some proof, then tell them.  hippy, look... if was can prove to coffey it is not russians, maybe he will ease off the button a little.
i got to tell you, that guy scares me a lot more than whatever's down there.  a.j. squared away goddamn jarhead robot.  okay, gimme a couple hours on this.
i think it likes you.
it is trying to communicate.
you done impressing yourself, ace?
no way that could just be seawater.
they must have learned how to control water... i mean at a molecular level.  they can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever.  put it under intelligent control.
maybe their whole technology is based on that. controlling water.
that thing was probably their version of big geek... like an rov.
just checking is out, huh?  how come?
i think they are from 'you know'.  some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  no light.
happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
you boss is having a full-on meltdown.  guy's fixing to pull the pin on fifty kilotons and we are all ringside!
what is the timer set for?
schoenick... your lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
that guy's crazier'n a shithouse rat!
thanks.  how you feeling, big guy?
figured i was dead, there, when i seen that angel comin' toward me.
he is jammed the mechanism.
now what?
okay, I am going to free-swim to hatch six... get inside, get the door open from the other side.
bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
then i guess you better wish me luck, huh?
hafta... go on to... the moonpool.  only way.
i can't... make it... podner.
he can not get to the door... i think he is going to try and take him himself.
he could not be that dumb.  the guy's a trained killer.  bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling one night over laundry duty.
shit!
give me that!!
you owe me one, virgil.
can we negotiate later?  there is big geek.
you did okay, back there.  i was fairly impressed.
not good enough.  we still gotta catch big geek.
not in this thing.
you totaled it, huh?
yeah.  so sue me.
it is flooding like a son of the bitch.
you noticed.
try again.
deepcore, this is cab one.  we need assistance, over.  deepcore, this--
well, that is that.
wonderful.  there is some light from somewhere...
good hundred yards, I would say.
they will come out after us.
yeah, but it is going to take them a while to find us.  we better get this flooding stopped.
you see where it is coming in?
somewhere behind this panel.  hold this.
can not get to it.  have to pull this panel off. you go any tools?
i do not know, look around.
son of a bitch!
calm down, bud.
okay... okay.  we gotta get you out of here.
how?
i do not know how!
we have only got one suit.
i know!  i know!  but we better come up with something.
aaargh!!  I am freezing!
okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
seven, eight minute swim each way... not enough time.  look at this...  time i get back you will be--
alright, put this on.
what, you growing gills all of a sudden?  you got it on, keep it on.
do not argue, goddamnit, just--
no way!  forget it.  not an option.
lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
no!!  now be logical, bud, you're--
fuck logic!!
listen... will you listen to me for a second!? you are for the suit on and you are a better swimmer than me.  right?  so i got a plan...
what is the plan?
i drown, you tow me back to the rig--
what kind of plan is that!??
it is insane.
it is the only way, bud.  now trust me.
oh god, lins... i--
tell me later.
go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. you got all that?
got it. over.
meet me in the moonpool.  move fast.
is that it?  is this right?
yeah!  i mean, i do not know... it looks right.
all right.  do it!
hey... big boys do not cry, remember?
hi, lady.
hi, tough guy.  i guess it worked, huh?
'course is worked.  you are never wrong, are you? how d'you feel.
I have been better.  next time it is your turn, okay?
no, bud, no... not you.
who then?
4800 feet.  it is official.
bud, according to monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive.  bet you did not think you would be doing this when you got up this morning.
8500 feet, bud.  everything okay?
ask him a pressure effects.  tremors, vision problems, euphoria.
ensign monk want to know how you feel.
12000 feet.  jesus, i do not believe he is doing this.
shut up, hippy.  bud, how you doing?
uh, oh...
what kind of luminous things, bud?
he is losing it.  talk to him.  keep him with us.
bud, it is the pressure.  try to concentrate. concentrate on my voice.  just listen to my voice.
he can still make it.
i know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I am there in the dark with you, bud you are not alone...
what kind of light?
he is hallucinating badly.
would we see the flash?
through three miles of water?   i do not know.
we should be dead.  we did not decompress.
out blood oughta be fizzin' like a warm, shook- up coke.
hello, brigman.
hello, mrs. brigman.
