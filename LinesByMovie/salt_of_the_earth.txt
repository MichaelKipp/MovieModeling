are you sick, mama?
no, estellita.
are you sad?  are we going to church? for your confession?
later. when i finish the ironing.
hear you had a little trouble, quintero. defective fuse?  well, you are all in one piece. so what is the beef?
you know the beef. this new rule of yours, that we work alone. we are taking it up with the super.
super's busy -- with your negotiatin' committee.
so much the better.
now wait a minute. super's the one made the rule. he am not going to give you no helper.
he will if he wants us to go on blasting.
foreman wants to get the ore out. miner wants to get his brothers out. in one piece.
you work alone, savvy? you can not handle the job, I will find someone who can.
who? a scab?
an american.
mama, can i put the candles ...
hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
we are only one payment behind. i argued with her. it is not right.
it is not right, she says. was it right that we bought this ... this instrument?
but you had to have it, did not you? it was so nice to listen
i listen to it. every night. when you are out to the beer parlor.
where you going?
got to talk to the brothers.
this water's cold again.
I am sorry. the fire's gone out.
forget it.
forget it? i chop wood for the stove five times a day. every time i remember. i remember that across the tracks the anglo miners have hot water in pipes. and bathrooms. inside.
do you think i like living this way? what do you want of me?!
we did. it got lost in the shuffle.
what?
we can not get everything at once. right now we have got more important demands.
what is more important than sanitation?
the safety of the men -- that is more important! five accidents this week -- all because of speed-up. you are a woman, you do not know what it is like up there.
first we got to get equality on the job. then we will work on these other things. leave it to the men.
i see. the men. you will strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
now do not start talking against the union again.
what has it got me, your union?
esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  when estella was a baby, and we could not even afford a doctor when she got sick? it was for our families! we met in graveyards to build that union!
all right. have your strike. I will have my baby. but no hospital will take me, because I will be a striker's wife. the store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. and we will get behind on the payments again, and then they will come and take away the radio...
is that all you care about? that radio? can not you think of anything except yourself?
if i think of myself it is because you never think of me. never. never. never...
stop it! the children are watching. stop it!
never... never... never!
aaah, what is the use?
take a drink. calm down!
i say we gotta take action. now.
do not horse me. price of zinc's never been higher. they do not want no strike -- not with their war boom on.
then why is the company hanging tough? they have signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
because most of us here are mexican- americans! because we want equality with anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
exactly. and equality's the one thing the bosses can not afford. the biggest club they have over the anglo locals is, "well -- at least you get more than the mexicans."
okay, so discrimination hurts the anglo too, but it hurts me more. and I have had enough of it!
but you do not pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. you wait till you are ready, so you can win.
do the bosses wait? no sanitation. so my kids get sick. does the company doctor wait? twenty bucks. so we miss one payment on the radio i bought for my wife. does the company store wait? "pay -- or we take it away." why they in such a hurry, the bosses' store? they are trying to scare us, that is why -- to make us afraid to move. to hang on to what we got -- and like it! well, i do not like it I am not scared ... and I am fed up -- to here!
what are you doing here?  something wrong with mama?
i thought maybe you forgot...
forgot what?
it is mama's saint's day.
why are they singing, mama?
they are singing for me.
can we light the candles now? on the cake?
yes. we will light the candles.
i did not mean to weep again. why should i weep for joy?
I am a fool.
no, no ...
was it expensive, the beer?
antonio paid for it.
forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
i did forget. lus told me.
to the mine?
sure. where they are negotiating. in the company office. we will go up there and picket the place.
come on, esperanza -- how about it? we got to.
no. no. i can't. if ramn ever found me on a picket line ...
i told you it would happen. it is bound to happen when a man works alone!
why did not you give a warning signal?
your foreman says that is a foreman's job.
i checked the drift just before he blasted. it was all clear ... the man must have been asleep or something.
you were not even there. you were back at the station. kalinsky told me ...
you are a liar, pancho. a no-good, dirty ...
why did not you support her? you are the worst of the lot.
but honey ...
or why do not you just put a sign outside? "no dogs or women allowed!"
mornin'.
how is it going?
well, those new fellows you hired from out of town -- we brought 'em up here in a truck this morning, but they took one look at that picket line and turned tail.
now why do not you let these gentlemen pass? do not you know who is in that car?
it is the paymaster from moscow -- with our gold.
no, no, it is the president of the company himself -- come all the way out here to make jenkins general manager. so why you acting so mean?
want to go up to your office, mr. alexander?
naturally. you think i parked here for a cup of coffee?
you are welcome to one.
no thanks.
the men would like to know who this gentleman is.
that is none of their affair.
that is all right -- it is no secret. my name's hartwell. I am from the company's eastern office.
you mean delaware?
no. new york.
new york? you are not the company president by any chance?
no ...
too bad. the men've always wanted to get a look at the president.  but you have come out here to settle the strike?
well, if that is possible ...
it is possible. just negotiate.
are we talking to a union spokesman?
i mean it. i know your work record. you were in line for foreman when this trouble started -- did you know that? you had a real future with this company, but you let those reds stir you up. and now they will sell you down the river. why do not you wake up, ray?  that is your name, is not it, ray?
no. my name is quintero. mister quintero.
are you going to let us pass -- or do i have to call the sheriff?
there is nothing stopping you.
what is the matter?
it is nothing. just a little catch ...
lus! come down here!
papa! we seen 'em! two scabs! over there!
ramn ... listen for the love of god ...
you ... you ... I would expect it of an anglo, yes ... but you ...
ramn ... listen to me ... I am in a	jam ... i had to get a job ...
you judas ... blood-sucker ...
ramn -- listen my kids ...
t! traidor a tu gente! rompehuelga! desgraciado!
my kids do not have enough to eat!
you think my kids have enough to eat, you rat?
i know, it is wrong. just let me go. I will leave town ... just let me go.
you think i was going to work you over? i would not dirty my hands with you ...
mother of god ...have mercy ...
have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
hear those deputies slugged 'cente.
yeah. lots of provocation lately. they figure if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they can bust the strike.
and another thing. your attitude toward anglos. if you are going to be a leader ...
what attitude?
you lump them all together -- anglo workers and anglo bosses.
he is a guest in my house, is not he?
sure. but you want the truth? you are even suspicious of him.
maybe. i think he is got a few things to learn about our people.
go on. spill it.
well, you are the organizer. you work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you are dead right. but when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you do not give us anything to think about. you afraid we are too lazy to take initiative?
you know i do not think that.
maybe not. but there is another thing ... like when you came in tonight --  i heard you ask your wife, "who's that? his grandfather?"
we can not think of them just as housewives -- but as allies. and we have got to treat them as such.
look who is talking! the great white father, and world's champion of women's rights.
aw, cut it out, ruth.
me, I am a camp follower -- following this organizer from one mining camp to another -- montana, colorado, idaho. but did he ever think to organize the women? no. wives do not count in the anglo locals either.
a fighter, huh?
he was born fighting. and born hungry.
drink, drink, juanito. you will never have it so good.
he will have it good. some day.
what were they saying? about you? in there?
they say i am no good to you.
you are no good to me -- in jail.
I would lie on my cot in the cell and i could not sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. and I would say to myself, think of something nice. something beautiful. and then I would think of you. and my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.
not just juanito. you will have it good too, esperanza. we are going to win this strike.
what makes you so sure?
because if we lose, we lose more than a strike. we lose the union. and the men know this. and if we win, we win more than a few demands. we win...  ... something bigger. hope. hope for our kids. juanito can not grow strong on milk alone.
let them take it!
over my dead body.
i do not want your dead body. i do not want you back in jail either.
but it is yours. i will not let them ...
can not you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time?
jenkins am not no boss.  mean we are going to let people like jenkins stay here?
you can not send him back to oklahoma. it would be inhumane.
it is not fair ... i should be there with them. after all, I am the one who got the women the vote.
no.
but the motion passed. it is ... it is not democratic of you to ...
the union do not run my house.  those anglo dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves -- but you do not see any of them down there.
yes, i do. there is ruth barnes.
she is the organizer's, wife. she is got to be there.
no, she wants to be there.  and there is mrs. kalinsky.
there is jenkins' wife. you do not see her on no picket line.
anglo husbands can also be backward.
can be what?
backward.
not so sure about that. letter of the law, you know. all the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
whose side are you on anyway?
now do not get excited, mr. alexander. they will scatter like a covey of quail.
where is your mama?
she is coming. charley vidal gave her a lift.
boy! did you see the way mama whopped that deputy with her shoe? knocked the gun right out ...
i do not want you hanging around there, hear?
you all right?
sure.
must have been some experience for you, huh?
yes.
i guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
I am going back tomorrow.
you might get hurt.  listen, if you think I am going to play nursemaid from now on, you are crazy ... I have had these kids all day!
I have had them since the day they were born.
I am telling you. i do not stay home with these kids tomorrow.
okay. then, tomorrow, i take the kids with me to the picket line.
well?
I have tried everything but shootin' 'em down.
you have not tried locking them up!
you want 'em all arrested?
no, just the ring leaders. the fire-eaters. and the ones with big families ...  barton -- where is that boy?
he can not drink this milk. it will make him sick. he is on a formula.  i was a fool! i should not have kept him with me.
do not you worry. we will get some action.
how goes it?
it never ends.
three hours! just to heat enough water to wash this stuff!  i tell you something. if this strike is ever settled -- which i doubt -- i do not go back to work unless the company installs hot running water for us.  it should have been a union demand from the beginning.
yeah.
it is like charley vidal says -- there is two kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. the woman question, he calls it.
the woman question?
question, question -- the problem, what to do about 'em.
so? what does he want to do about 'em?
he says give 'em equality. equality in jobs, equality in the home. also sex equality.
what do you mean -- sex equality?
you know ...  what is good for the goose is good for the gander.
papa, can not i leave now? there is a meeting of the junior shop stewards ...
the what!
the junior shop stewards. there is lots of ways we can help.
do not i have enough troubles without them shipping you off to reform school?
but papa -- you need all the help you can get.
you have got to help around the house!
but you have got me doing everything. mama never used to make me dry the ...
you should have helped her without being asked.
how do you feel?
I am okay. but it is nice to be home.
four nights. how did you sleep?
we raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
did you have to sign a pledge? not to go back to the line?
no, no ... we would not do it.
but if you go back they will lock you up again.
no, no ... the sheriff had enough of us. we drove him crazy.
it is all set. consuelo's squad can take they day off tomorrow. we are taking over.
good. come in, we will work it out. sit down, sit down.
we have got to have a talk, you and me.
all right, but later. I have got a meeting now.
a meeting?
yes. to plan for the picket line tomorrow.
i waited up till midnight.
you were not waiting for me.
that meeting only lasted ten minutes.  the first night I am home, and you run to the beer parlor. what is it? can not you bear the sight of me?
be still ...
but you wanted to talk. tell me.
tell me.
we can not go on this way. i just can not go on living with you. not this way.
no. we can not can not go on this way. we can not go back to the old way either.
where are you going?
hunting.
when?
sun up.
alone?
no.
ramn -- you can't.
why not? I am not needed here.
but you are needed. especially now -- with most of the other men away. you are captain of the stand-by squad.
sure, the standby squad. stand-by for the funeral.
whose funeral? we are doing all right. there has not been a scab near the picket line for three days.
and you know why? because the company knows they can starve us out -- even if it takes another two, three months. what is it to them if the mine's shut down a little longer?
it is a lot to them. they would do anything to open that mine.
aah! they have got other mines. you do not see the larger picture.  they have got millions. millions. they can outlast us, and they know it.
you mean you are ready to give up?
who said anything about giving up? I will never go back to the company on my knees. never.
ramn were not getting weaker. we are stronger than ever before.  they are getting weaker. they thought they could break our picket line. and they failed. and now they can not win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
like what?
i do not know. but i can feel it coming. it is like ... like a lull before the storm. charley vidal says ...
charley vidal says!  do not throw charley vidal up to me!
charley's my friend. i need friends.  why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
i do not know what you are talking about.
no, you don't. have you learned nothing from this strike? why are you afraid to have me at your side? do you still think you can have dignity only if i have none?
you talk of dignity? after what you have been doing?
yes. i talk of dignity. the anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "stay in your place, you dirty mexican" -- that is what they tell you. but why must you say to me, "stay in your place." do you feel better having someone lower than you?
shut up, you are talking crazy.
whose neck shall i stand on, to make me feel superior? and what will i get out of it? i do not want anything lower than i am. I am low enough already. i want to rise. and push everything up with me as i go ...
will you be still?
and if you can not understand this you are a fool -- because you can not win this strike without me! you can not win anything without me!
so they had a little taste of what its like to be a woman ... and they run away.
with ramn it is ... pride. i spoke out of the bitterness in me. and he was hurt.
this is what we have been waiting for.
what are you saying?
this means they have given up trying to break the picket line.  now we can all fight together -- all of us.
got any more ideas?
i do not make policy.
