i mean, for good, jeffrey.
for good?. i can't. mom. not right in the middle of the term.
jeffrey. honey. your father's condition is serious. it is going to cost so much. we just will not have the money to keep you in school. I am telling you this now, so that you can get your things together and check out of school, honey, or whatever you have to do. it will save you another trip back. you are going to have to work at the store.
where is all your things, jeffrey?
this is it.
i sent a trunk home yesterday. this is all i have.
you look good, jeffrey. did you have a nice flight?
yeah. how is dad?
jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
be right down.
what time are visiting hours?
I have made arrangements with dr. gynde for 10:30. but jeffrey, you will have to walk over; i need the car this morning.
well. okay.
jeffrey, when you see your father.
yeah?
he does not know you are out of school. he thinks it is a vacation for you.
what?
it would be too much for him. so please let him think as he does, that you are home just to see him.
thanks a lot, mom.
.jeffrey!. nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store. maybe going back to school will be an option one day. i hope so.
i think it is important not to get depressed. depression is a terrible thing. they say it can bring on illness.
aunt barbara. I will try not to get depressed.
hi dad.
hey jeff.
looks like they have got you strapped in pretty good.
uh uh.
are you feeling okay?
uh uh.
good to see you, son.
it is good to see you, dad.
are you detective williams?
yes.
my name is jeffrey beaumont - i live near you. i believe you know my father, tom beaumont - beaumont's hardware store?
sure i do. i understand he is in the hospital. how is he?
he is alright, i guess. i hope. they are doing tests, that is why I am home from school. i was over at the hospital this morning and i was going home and in the field behind our neighborhood. there behind vista, i found an ear.
you did? a human ear?
yeah. I have got it here in this bag. i thought i should bring it to you.
yep, that is right. let's take a look at it.
by the way, jeffrey, this story is not going to the press and I am going to ask you to consider all you have heard strictly confidential. do not discuss this business with anyone, but me, or other police personnel. got it?
got it. thanks for letting me in on as much as you did.
come on. I will drive you home. it is on my way.
I am going out for awhile.
do you want the car?
no, I am just going to walk around.
alright.
jeffrey. you are not going down by lincoln, are you?
no. I am just going to walk around the neighborhood. do not worry.
hello. uh. my name is jeffrey beaumont. is detective williams in?
oh, yes, jeffrey. come in. he will be back any minute now. you are welcome to wait. is it urgent?
i just wanted to ask him a few questions, that is all. maybe i better go.
really, he will be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
alright.
i was sorry to hear about your father. i know your mother from church. it is such a shame.
yeah, i know.
would you like a piece of cake?
no. no thank you.
it is a real good chocolate cake. duncan hines' devil's food. real good.
yeah. okay.
mike's got to go.  nice to meet you.
yeah, nice meetin' yuh.
he comes over to study.
yeah.
come into the study a minute.
excuse me, mrs. williams.
detective williams here. yeah. tell him to go to sergeant milton. yeah, copy.  well, jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. very interesting. i know you must be curious to know more.  but. I am afraid I am going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. one day. when it is all sewed up, I will let you know all the details. right now, though. i can't.
i understand. I am just real curious like you said.
i was the same way when i was you age. i guess that is what got me into this business.
it must be great.
and it is horrible too.  I am sorry jeffrey. that is the way it has to be. anyway. I am sure you do understand.
mrs. williams? thanks for the cake.
oh, you are welcome. nice to finally meet you, jeffrey.
say "goodnight" to sandy.
yeah, how did you know?
i just know, that is all. i remember you from central.
oh yeah?
you were pretty popular. did not you run for some office?
yeah i did. treasurer. should not you be studying or something.
am i bothering you?
no. you are not bothering me. you a senior?
yes.
how is central these days?
terrible. boring.
what else is new?. right?
yeah. what are you doing now?
I am home from school. my father's in the hospital.
that is too bad.
what do you know about the ear?. anything?
did not my father tell you not to talk about it?
come on. you brought it up. do you know anything?
i do not really know much but bits and pieces . i hear things. my room is right above my father's office. the ear. there is no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. that is direct from the coroner's office. the person is unknown. there are a couple of cases i get mixed up on, but i think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. i heard some of the same names.
do you know who was brought in for questioning?
there were at least three, maybe four. but a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. there is also a business man over by the franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.
were all these people questioned this afternoon?
no. this has been going on for some time . several months. about six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. they were from people who were reported missing. they never found one complete body. only parts.
the ear is from a missing person maybe?
maybe so.
it is a strange world is not it? do you know what building the woman lives in?
yeah. it is close by. that is what is creepy. they have had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except i do not know what they have found out because my father is not in charge of her.
i guess you have to get back home soon?
not really, why?  you want to see the building?. come on, I will show you.
that is the building. she lives on the seventh floor. do not stop to look long . the police are watching.
where are they?
i do not know. you are not supposed to see them. they are supposed to see you.
did they find out anything when they questioned her?
i do not know. like i said, she is not my father's case.
oh yeah. what about those other people? . anything?
my father is watching the businessman. the businessman had a partner who disappeared. left his whole business and family, his wife and two kids. they think he is been murdered.
you really do hear a lot, do not you?
yeah, i guess so.  what are you going to do now that you are home?
i have to help out in my father's hardware store. they are giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
still, it must be kinda rough.
it is not bad. but it is bad enough. it is a lot worse for my father.  i used to know a kid who lived there and who had the biggest tongue in the world.
what happened to him?
i do not know. he moved away.
I have got to go in.
thanks for the tour. it was nice talking to you.
i guess so. like you said. it is a strange world.
yeah. good bye.
you hungry or thirsty, or both?
i do not know.
I would like to talk to you about something.
just a minute. pull over and wait a minute.
i do not want to cause any trouble.
I am here, are not i?
i guess mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
ooooo, you are smart. just do not get too smart.
alright, now tell me. what is it?
there are opportunities in life for gaining knowledge and experience. sometimes, in some cases. it is necessary to take a risk. i got to thinking. I will bet a person could learn a lot by getting into that woman's apartment. you know. sneak in and hide and observe.
you said it was a strange world. and you are the strangest part of it. are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. this gives me the creeps.
settle down. i have a plan which i think will work. there is very little for you to do, but i do need your help. .aren't you curious about my plan?
it would not hurt to hear the plan, i guess.
alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that i could crawl into later.
now, how are you going to do that?
right out in the car i happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. i will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. i will spray her apartment. after a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and i will then jimmy a window.
what will i say when she comes to the door?
you will be a jehovah's witness. i have a few "awake" magazines for you. you do not have to keep her very long. a few seconds is all I will need. whatiya think?
i do not know. it sounds like a good daydream, . but actually doing it is too weird. too dangerous.
let's just try the first part. if that goes well, we will see about the rest. no one will suspect us, because no one would believe two people like us would be crazy enough to do something like this.
you have got a point there.
now. we will walk over so there is no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. i can stall if it is more, but i need time to find a good window .alright?
alright.
let's go.
okay, I am going ahead. wait a minute, what is her name?
oh bother. dorothy vallens, seventh floor.  look on the mailbox for her number, bright boy.
thanks. dorothy vallens. okay. good luck . three minutes, no sooner.
alright. good luck, yourself.
yes? what is it?
pest control. gotta do your apartment.
oh god, that stuff stinks.
nope. it is new stuff. no smell.
oh yeah, that is good.
that oughta do it.
yeah.
are you alright?
yeah. let's get outta here. what happened?
i was just about to go to the door, when that man did my job for me. was it alright?
yes and no. did you recognize him?
no. i only saw his back. he went down another stairwell at the end of the hall.
i did not get a good look at him either, but he sure looked at me. i did not have time to get a window, but i found this key.  pretty nifty, huh?
yeah, if it opens the door.
yeah.
so. what is next?
pretty clever. are you game for more?
i owe you. since i goofed up this one.
you did not goof it up, but. you still owe me one. i want to sneak in tonight. it is friday. do you have a date tonight?
yes. i do.
well, it is friday night and you are a beautiful girl. i guess you would have a date. that does that.
you really want to do this, do not you?
i do not want you to get involved, really, i mean, i do, but if something went wrong i mean, like you said, they may be involved in murder.
I will tell mike I am sick. there is a game tonight anyway and he will never miss me. afterwards he can go out with the guys. just so the record is kept straight though, i love mike. what do want me to do?
first of all, we will have a nice dinner. try to find out where dorothy sings.
i already know. the "slow club." it is on route 7.
great. I will pick you up around eight o'clock. is that good?
yeah, but do not pick me up. my father may think it is strange. I will walk over to your house. I will be there at eight o'clock.
okay. you better get out before someone sees us.
doctor gynde. my whole family's sick. what is going on?
I am not sick.
can i use the car tonight?
of course, jeffrey.
what is the plan.
first of all, we are going to the slow club to see dorothy vallens. we will watch her for awhile. I would like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we will know she is there and not in her apartment.
brilliant.
then we will drive back to her apartment and i will plant myself there.
this is not my usual friday night!
I would like an ice-cold heineken.
that sounds good.
two.
here's to. an interesting experience.
I will drink to that.
jeffrey, i do not think you ought to do it.
why not?
it is crazy and dangerous. my god. i should not have told you.
it will be okay. i do not think you should wait out here though. i think you should go home. can you drive this car?
yeah. but.
leave it in the front of your house for me. okay?
o.k.
could you wait a little while. this key may not fit.
. i wish you would not do this.  it does not make any sense. let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
I am going in, sandy. I will see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
i. i do not want to see you tomorrow. mike's coming over.
oh, okay. can i call?
okay. yeah, call.
look. it can wait till sunday.
call tomorrow. it is okay. good luck. i hope you can sneak out okay. you are going to wait until she is asleep?
yeah.
I am going to wait here until she comes.
are you sure?
I will honk four times so you will hear it and know she is on her way up. okay?
okay. thanks.
i do not know if you are a detective or a pervert.
that is for me to know and for you to find out. I will see you. i mean call you. okay?
okay, okay. bye.

well.
i mean, you do not exactly have the build for a football. i mean. no offense.
no. you are right.
i mean. some guys play anyway but they usually get slaughtered.
yeah, well i never wanted to get slaughtered much.
well, most guys don't. i mean that is the point. you all mind if i take my vitamins?

you can change it if you want to.
i do not know why we have to watch t.v.
mike. we do not have to watch it. come on.
here you are. would anyone like coffee?
that sounds great!
anyone else?. alright jeffrey, just a minute.
well, how did it go?. what happened?
well. I have found out some things. nothing really for certain. there are some strange people involved.
what did you see?
well.  maybe we should discuss this somewhere else. you know what i mean?
sandy?. could i talk to you a minute?
sure. just a sec.  excuse me.
come on out a minute, okay?
okay.
please excuse me a moment, jeffrey, and I will get to the dishes.
sure thing. please do not worry about me. can i help you with the dishes?
nice of you to offer, jeffrey, but certainly not. just relax and enjoy your coffee. I am sure sandy will be back soon.
jeffrey?
yes?
if you want to come up a minute, I will show you some pictures.
these are beautiful. how is the case coming?
okay.
anything you can tell me?
the criminals are winning.
is that why you say it is horrible?
yes.
i guess you have seen some bad things.
yes i have - so bad i would not poison your mind by telling you.
why do you do it?
i will not let the bastards get me up against the wall. it is an act of defiance.
yeah. i get it.
what is this? what color is it?
blue. it is blue velvet.
what is with mike?
he got a little jealous.
I am sorry, i didn't.
it is okay. do not worry about it.
you want a dairy queen?
no way. I am about to blow up.
you want to tell me about it?
. ok. it is a strange world, sandy. this is what i have found out. what i think i have found out. dorothy vallens is married to a man named don. they have a son. i think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named frank who has now cut off both of don's ears. i think he is holding them to make her do things for him. i think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. i call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. i do not know what he does but i think he is on drugs supplied by frank. frank is a very dangerous man.
wow. should you tell my father?
i do not see how i can. and i can not prove any of this. i got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
you saw a lot in one night.
. actually. I have been in twice.
twice. without her sensing anything?
yes.
did you see her undressed?
yeah. i mean. a little, . you know.
yeah?
that does not bother you, does it?
who, me? why should it?
that is what i thought.
you are sure right. it is a strange world.
why are there people like frank. why is there so much trouble in this world.?
i do not know. i had a dream. in fact. the night i met you.  . in the dream the world was dark because there were not any robins. you know, birds. robins stood for love. and all of a sudden thousands of robins flew down and brought this blinding light of love. and it felt like that love would be the only thing that would make any difference. i guess. until the robins come there is trouble.
yeah i guess so.  you are a neat girl.
so are you.  i mean you are a neat guy. we better get back.
i guess so. you want to help me watch frank?. I am going to stake out frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.
no, silly - I am still in school you know. but I will meet you after school and you can tell me what you have learned. you better be careful, jeffrey.
i will.  I will pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
okay. be careful.
okay, sandy.
can i give you a kiss good night?
you better not, jeffrey.
okay. okay.
goodnight.
see ya tomorrow.
you were late.
I am really sorry.
what am i going to do?
you want to go talk to him?
yeah, but. i do not think it is going to do much good. let's go. I will try to talk to him later.
you know, that cheese is practically all chemicals.
that is what makes it so good. you wanta hear what i saw today?
shoot.
number one. i saw the yellow man go into frank's building, laughing with frank. now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
nothing really, but it is interesting. they know each other. they seem to like each other.
maybe. but i think the yellow man is on drugs. i think frank supplies him.
oh yeah?
number two. i saw the yellow man come out. this time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. they drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. number three. now get this. in the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
jeffrey!!
then these guys told me the police will find a huge amount of drugs inside the dead man's place.
i can not believe what you are finding out. are you going to continue with this. are you going back to her apartment?
yeah.
jeffrey?. why?
I am seeing something that was always hidden. I am involved in a mystery. I am learning. and it is all secret.
you like mysteries that much?
yeah. you are a mystery. i like you. very much.
you worry about me really?
yes. is that so surprising?. yeah i worry. a lot. i got you into this.
come in.
hello.
it used to make me laugh .but.
I am sorry .maybe i better go dorothy.
yes. frank-
frank is coming?
no. how could he?. do not go. you think I am crazy, do not you? i want you to stay.  . do not hate me.
i sure do not hate you.
I am not crazy.  i know the difference between right and wrong.
that is good.
do you like my body?
sure i do.
what do you want to do?
I am doing it.
are you a bad boy?
whatiya mean?
do you want to do bad things?  anything. anything.
what do you want?
i want you to hurt me.
no. i told you. i do not want to hurt you. i want to help you. i think i know some of what is happening to you.  . dorothy? frank has your husband and son. dorothy? does not he? you have to do something dorothy. go to the police.
you like to open me. do not you?
yes.
what if i told frank that you opened me?
that would not be too good, would it?
frank would open you.
okay. i know you have been scared. now you want to scare someone.

shut up.
beeeee careful.

what if frank came over here and found us?

I am glad you do.
there is so much i want to tell you. I am in so much darkness though with things moving. there is darkness sucking me. it is kissing me and darkness is entering me. in every hole. it is opening me to a death.

sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
aunt barbara. i love you, but you are not going to get it.
great. hey. I have got a bit of a problem. i know some things. that could help your father but you might get into trouble.
jeffrey. are they important things? well forget me - you have to tell him. jeffrey. i mean it.
jeffrey! come on in.
hi. hi sandy. I am sorry to bother you, but I have got to talk to you.
okay. come on in. looks like you had a bad face lift.
yeah.
okay?
okay. i got to tell you. i've. discovered some things. .anyway i have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. the first picture is this.
and that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. i think a girl named dorothy vallens is in trouble with these people. i think frank has taken her husband and her son.
i have no hard proof of any of this. her address is also on the photos. i think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. i think frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow frank is getting all their drugs. i had to tell you i got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it is over now for sure. .i had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
well now jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
i can not tell you the whole story. i. i took it upon myself. i can not say more.
is sandy part of this?
no. not at all.
who knows you have these?
only you. and the photo lab.
you are all through with this now?
for now. alright. you better be. and sandy better not be involved with this, i can tell you. be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
yes sir.

please get to your father and send him and the police to dorothy's apartment right away. be sure your father comes. something is happening over there. they are hurting someone. the guy she loves. tell them to hurry. I am going over right now.
no jeffrey!!
yes I am going. i have to. i love you. i will, believe me.
detective williams!! detective williams!!
detective williams here. is that you, jeffrey?
yes it is me!!! frank is on his way up to dorothy's apartment.  oh no. frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  detective williams. hurry. I am in the apartment. hurry. I am hiding in the back bedroom.
we are ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
because of your information i alerted internal affairs to check out detective gordon.  i had to keep on with him as if nothing was different.  he slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid frank's place.
does dorothy know her husband is dead?
not yet.
oh my god. is her son ok?
we are looking for him. in your opinion, why did frank kidnap dorothy's son and husband?
he became obsessed with her. she hated him. he had to have her. he kidnapped them to control her. to make her do things. then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I am not kidding. frank loved blue. blue velvet. he had to have dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
you seemed to see some very interesting things on your little escapade with dorothy vallens.
yeah. i guess i did.  what is going to happen to me?
we are going to leave that up to detective williams. I will tell you though. you are okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
yeah. i sure know that. yeah, but how many more are out there?
how ya doin' dad?
hey jeff. I am feelin' so much better.
good deal dad.
look jeffrey.
yeah. i just saw him outside. maybe the robins are here.
