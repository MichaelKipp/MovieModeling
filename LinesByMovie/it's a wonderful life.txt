hello, joseph, trouble?
looks like we'll have to send someone down –– a lot of people are asking for help for a man named george bailey.
george bailey. yes, tonight's his crucial night. you're right, we'll have to send someone down immediately. whose turn is it?
that's why i came to see you, sir. it's that clock-maker's turn again.
oh –– clarence. hasn't got his wings yet, has he? we've passed him up right along.
because, you know, sir, he's got the i.q. of a rabbit.
yes, but he's got the faith of a child –– simple. joseph, send for clarence.
you sent for me, sir?
yes, clarence. a man down on earth needs our help.
splendid! is he sick?
no, worse. he's discouraged. at exactly ten-forty-five pm tonight, earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away god's greatest gift.
oh, dear, dear! his life! then i've only got an hour to dress. what are they wearing now?
you will spend that hour getting acquainted with george bailey.
sir . . . if i should accomplish this mission –– i mean –– might i perhaps win my wings? i've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir –– and people are beginning to talk.
what's that book you've got there?
the adventures of tom sawyer.
clarence, you do a good job with george bailey, and you'll get your wings.
oh, thank you, sir. thank you.
poor george . . . sit down.
sit down? what are . . .
if you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
well, naturally. of course.
well, keep your eyes open. see the town?
where? i don't see a thing.
oh, i forgot. you haven't got your wings yet. now look, i'll help you out. concentrate. begin to see something?
why, yes. this is amazing.
if you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
oh, wonderful!
hey, who's that?
that's your problem, george bailey.
a boy?
that's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
two cents worth of shoelaces?
she was here first.
made up your mind yet?
i'll take chocolate.
with coconuts?
i don't like coconuts.
you don't like coconuts! say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from? lookit here –– from tahiti –– fiji islands, the coral sea!
a new magazine! i never saw it before.
of course you never. only us explorers can get it. i've been nominated for membership in the national geographic society.
george! george!
yes, sir.
you're not paid to be a canary.
no, sir.
mr. gower, do you want something . . . anything?
no.
anything i can do back here?
no.
yes, sir. they have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
ummmm . . .
is it a charge, sir?
yes –– charge.
mr. gower, i think . . .
aw, get going!
yes, sir.
avast, there, captain cook! where you headin'?
got to see pop, uncle billy.
some other time, george.
it's important.
there's a squall in there that's shapin' up into a storm.
i'm not crying, mr. potter.
well, you're begging, and that's a whole lot worse.
all i'm asking is thirty days more . . .
pop!
have you put any real pressure on those people of yours to pay those mortgages?
times are bad, mr. potter. a lot of these people are out of work.
then foreclose!
i can't do that. these families have children.
pop!
they're not my children.
but they're somebody's children.
are you running a business or a charity ward?
well, all right . . .
mr. potter, what makes you such a hard-skulled character? you have no family –– no children. you can't begin to spend all the money you've got.
so i suppose i should give it to miserable failures like you and that idiot brother of yours to spend for me.
no . . . no . . . no. . .
don't hurt my ear again!
mr. gower, i won't ever tell anyone. i know what you're feeling. i won't ever tell a soul. hope to die, i won't.
oh, george.
what did you stop it for?
i want you to take a good look at that face.
who is it?
george bailey.
oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
that's the kid.
it's a good face. i like it. i like george bailey. tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
not a soul.
did he ever marry the girl? did he ever go exploring?
well, wait and see.
big –– see! i don't want one for one night. i want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from italy and baghdad, samarkand . . . a great big one.
i see, a flying carpet, huh? i don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job, would you?
now you're talkin'. gee whiz, i could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. how much does this cost?
no charge.
that's my trick ear, joe. it sounded as if you said no charge.
what boat you sailing on?
i'm working across on a cattle boat.
a cattle boat?
mr. gower . . . mr. gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. it's just exactly what i wanted.
aw, forget it.
oh, it's wonderful.
hope you enjoy it.
hey, ernie!
hiya, george!
hi, bert.
george . . .
ernie, i'm a rich tourist today. how about driving me home in style?
good afternoon, mr. bailey.
hello, violet. hey, you look good. that's some dress you got on there.
oh, you two idiots! george, sit down and have dinner.
i've eaten.
well, aren't you going to finish dressing for your graduation party? look at you.
i don't care. it's george's tux.
pop, can i have the car? i'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.
what plates?
oh, mom –– i'm chairman of the eats committee and we only need a couple of dozen.
oh, no you don't. harry, now, not my best haviland.
hope you have a good trip, george. uncle billy and i are going to miss you.
i'm going to miss you, too, pop. what's the matter? you look tired.
oh, i had another tussle with potter today.
oh . . .
i thought when we put him on the board of directors, he'd ease up on us a little bit.
i wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
oh, he's a sick man. frustrated and sick. sick in his mind, sick in his soul, if he has one. hates everybody that has anything that he can't have. hates us mostly, i guess.
got a match?
very funny. very funny.
put those things in the car and i'll get your tie and studs together.
okay, mom. you coming later? you coming later, george?
what do you mean, and be bored to death?
couldn't want a better death. lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
i hope it works.
father, did i act like that when i graduated from high school?
pretty much. you know, george, wish we could send harry to college with you. your mother and i talked it over half the night.
we have that all figured out. you see, harry'll take my job at the building and loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
he's pretty young for that job.
well, no younger than i was.
maybe you were born older, george.
how's that?
i say, maybe you were born older. i suppose you've decided what you're going to do when you get out of college.
oh, well, you know what i've always talked about –– build things . . . design new buildings –– plan modern cities –– all that stuff i was talking about.
still after that first million before you're thirty.
no, i'll settle for half that in cash.
i know it's soon to talk about it.
oh, now, pop, i couldn't. i couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
yes . . . yes . . . you're right, son.
you see what i mean, don't you, pop?
this town is no place for any man unless he's willing to crawl to potter. you've got talent, son. you get yourself an education. then get out of here.
pop, do you want a shock? i think you're a great guy.
i'm going to miss old annie. pop, i think i'll get dressed and go over to harry's party.
have a good time, son.
oh, oh. sam wainwright! how are you? when did you get here?
oh, this afternoon. i thought i'd give the kids a treat.
old college graduate now, huh?
yeah –– old joe college wainwright, they call me. well, freshman, looks like you're going to make it after all.
yep.
hee-haw!
hee-haw!
hey, george . . .
hello, violet.
hello, what am i bid?
george.
hiya, marty. well, it's old home week.
do me a favor, will you, george?
what's that?
well, you remember my kid sister, mary?
oh, yeah, yeah.
oh . . . me? oh, well, i feel funny enough already, with all these kids.
aw, come on. be a sport. just dance with her one time and you'll give her the thrill of her life.
well, hello.
hello. you look at me as if you didn't know me.
well, i don't.
you've passed me on the street almost every day.
me?
uh-huh.
uh-uh. that was a little girl named mary hatch. that wasn't you.
i'm not very good at this.
neither am i.
okay –– what can we lose?
hot dog! just like an organ.
beautiful.
do i look as funny as you do?
i guess i'm not quite the football type. you . . . look wonderful. you know, if it wasn't me talking i'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
well, why don't you say it?
i don't know. maybe i will say it. how old are you anyway?
eighteen.
eighteen? why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
too young or too old?
oh, no. just right. your age fits you. yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
your . . . your caboose, my lady.
you may kiss my hand.
ummmmm . . .
okay, then, i'll throw a rock at the old granville house.
oh, no, don't. i love that old house.
oh, no, george, don't. it's full of romance, that old place. i'd like to live in it.
in that place?
uh-huh.
i wouldn't live in it as a ghost. now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
what'd you wish, george?
well, not just one wish. a whole hatful, mary. i know what i'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. i'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and i'm going to see the world. italy, greece, the parthenon, the colosseum. then i'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then i'm going to build things. i'm gonna build air fields. i'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. i'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
oh, no.
come on, tell me.
if i told you it might not come true.
what is it you want, mary? what do you want? you want the moon? just say . . .
i'll take it. and then what?
well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? and the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair.  am i talking too much?
ouch!
gesundheit. this requires a little thought here.
they're way downtown. they'd be on my side, too.
i'm going to scream!
mary . . . mary, i'm sorry. i've got to go.
come on, george, let's hurry.
did you get a doctor?
i want the board to know that george gave up his trip to europe to help straighten things out here these past few months. good luck to you at school, george.
thanks.
now we come to the real purpose of this meeting –– to appoint a successor to our dear friend, peter bailey.
thank you very much.
it was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
yes, sir.
you see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow money. what does that get us? a discontented, lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class. and all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like peter bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible ideas. now, i say . . .
just a minute –– just a minute. now, hold on, mr. potter. you're right when you say my father was no business man. i know that. why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante building and loan, i'll never know. but neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . why, in the twenty-five years since he and uncle billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. isn't that right, uncle billy? he didn't save enough money to send harry to school, let alone me. but he did help a few people get out of your slums, mr. potter. and what's wrong with that? why . . . here, you're all businessmen here. doesn't it make them better citizens? doesn't it make them better customers? you . . . you said . . . what'd you say just a minute ago? . . . they had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. wait! wait for what? until their children grow up and leave them? until they're so old and broken-down that they . . . do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? just remember this, mr. potter, that this rabble you're talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? anyway, my father didn't think so. people were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!
i'm not interested in your book. i'm talking about the building and loan.
i know very well what you're talking about. you're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. that's what you're talking about, i know.  well, i've said too much. i . . . you're the board here. you do what you want with this thing. just one thing more, though. this town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to potter. come on, uncle billy!
what's that?
that's the best part of it. they've appointed george here as executive secretary to take his father's place.
oh, no! but, uncle billy . . .
you can keep him on. that's all right. as secretary you can hire anyone you like.
i know. i know. he didn't go.
that's right. not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother harry, and sent him to college. harry became a football star –– made second team all american.
yes, but what happened to george?
uh-huh. breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
no, no, no, no! anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
peanut?
oh, am i glad to see you.
say, where's mother?
she's home cooking the fatted calf. come on, let's go.
oh, wait. wait . . . wait a minute.
hello.
how do you do.
well, what do you know –– wife.
well, how do you do. congratulations. congratulations. what am i doing?
oh, thank you, george, old boy, old boy. now, look –– if you'll point me in the right direction . . . would you do that? george?
right down here.
old building and loan pal, huh . . .
now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
that way, huh?
she's swell.
looks like she can keep harry on his toes.
keep him out of bedford falls, anyway.
did you know that mary hatch is back from school?
uh-huh.
came back three days ago.
hmmmm . . .
nice girl, mary.
hmmmm . . .
kind that will help you find the answers, george.
hmmm . . .
oh, stop that grunting.
hmmm . . .
can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on mary?
sure –– sam wainwright.
hmmm?
yes. sam's crazy about mary.
well, she's not crazy about him.
well, how do you know? did she discuss it with you?
no.
well then, how do you know?
well, i've got eyes, haven't i? why, she lights up like a firefly whenever you're around.
oh . . .
and besides, sam wainwright's away in new york, and you're here in bedford falls.
and all's fair in love and war?
mother, you know, i can see right through you –– right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?
uh-huh.
well, here's your hat, what's your hurry? all right, mother, old building and loan pal, i think i'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.
oh, george!
now, if you'll just point me in the right direction . . . this direction?  good night, mrs. bailey.
hello, georgie-porgie.
hello, vi.
what gives?
nothing.
where are you going?
oh, i'll probably end up down at the library.
let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
huh?
then we can go up to the falls. it's beautiful up there in the moonlight, and there's a green pool up there, and we can swim in it. then we can climb mt. bedford, and smell the pines, and watch the sunrise against the peaks, and . . . we'll stay up there the whole night, and everybody'll be talking and there'll be a terrific scandal . . .
hello, mary. i just happened to be passing by.
yeah, so i noticed. have you made up your mind?
how's that?
have you made up your mind?
about what?
about coming in. your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
my mother just called you? well, how did she know?
didn't you tell her?
i didn't tell anybody. i just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
well, are you coming in or aren't you?
well, i'll come in for a minute, but i didn't tell anybody i was coming over here.
when did you get back?
tuesday.
where'd you get that dress?
do you like it?
it's all right. i thought you'd go back to new york like sam and ingie, and the rest of them.
oh, i worked there for a couple of vacations, but i don't know . . . i guess i was homesick.
all right, for a minute. i still can't understand it though. you know i didn't tell anybody i was coming here.
would you rather leave?
no, i don't want to be rude.
well, then, sit down.
well, i see it still smells like pine needles in here.
thank you.
oh . . . yeah, yeah. that's all right.
don't you like her?
well, of course i like her. she's a peach.
oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
no, marriage is all right for harry, and marty, and sam and you.
i have a big deal coming up that's going to make us all rich. george, you remember that night in martini's bar when you told me you read someplace about making plastics out of soybeans?
huh? yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. yeah.
well, dad's snapped up the idea. he's going to build a factory outside of rochester. how do you like that?
rochester? well, why rochester?
well, why not? can you think of anything better?
oh, i don't know . . . why not right here? you remember that old tool and machinery works? you tell your father he can get that for a song. and all the labor he wants, too. half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
that so? well, i'll tell him. hey, that sounds great! oh, baby, i knew you'd come through. now, here's the point. mary, mary, you're in on this too. now listen. have you got any money?
money? yeah . . . well, a little.
well, now listen. i want you to put every cent you've got into our stock, you hear? and george, i may have a job for you; that is, unless you're still married to that broken-down building and loan. this is the biggest thing since radio, and i'm letting you in on the ground floor. oh, mary . . . mary . . .
george . . . george . . . george . . .
mary . . .
if either of you two see a stranger around here, it's me.
hey, look! somebody's driving this cab.
bert, the cop, sent this over. he said to float away to happy land on the bubbles.
oh, look at this. champagne!
where are we going?  look at this. there's the kitty, ernie. here, come on, count it, mary.
i feel like a bootlegger's wife.  look!
you know what we're going to do? we're going to shoot the works. a whole week in new york. a whole week in bermuda. the highest hotels –– the oldest champagne –– the richest caviar –– the hottest music, and the prettiest wife!
after that, who cares?
that does it –– come here.
just a minute, dear. oh-oh . . .
please, let's not stop, george.
i'll be back in a minute, mary.
what is this, uncle billy? a holiday?
george . . .
why didn't you call me?
i just did, but they said you left. this is a pickle, george, this is a pickle.
all right now, what happened? how did it start?
how does anything like this ever start? all i know is the bank called our loan.
when?
about an hour ago. i had to hand over all our cash.
all of it?
every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
holy mackerel!
and then i got scared, george, and closed the doors. i . . . i . . . i . . .
the whole town's gone crazy.
yes, hello? george . . . it's potter.
hello?
george, was it a nice wedding? gosh, i wanted to be there.
yeah . . .  . . . you can take this one off now.
those rockefellers!
get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
we'll save them for seed. a toast!
hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
how would you like to get a ticket next week? haven't you any romance in you?
sure i have, but i got rid of it.
come on, we got to get this up. he's coming.
who?
the groom, idiot. come on, get that ladder.
get that ladder up here.
all right –– all right.
hurry up . . . hurry up . . . hurry up.
i'm hurrying.
oh, mary . . .
remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? this is what i wished for.
darling, you're wonderful.
what's that?
i own the house. me, giuseppe martini. i own my own house. no more we live like pigs in thisa potter's field. hurry, maria.
goodbye, everybody!
all in . . .
we just stopped in town to take a look at the new factory, and then we're going to drive on down to florida.
oh . . .
oh, i'm afraid i couldn't get away, sam.
still got the nose to the old grindstone, eh? jane, i offered to let george in on the ground floor in plastics, and he turned me down cold.
oh, now, don't rub it in.
i'm not rubbing it in. well, i guess we better run along.
so long, george. see you in the funny papers.
goodbye, sam.
have fun.
thanks for dropping around.
thank you, sir. quite a cigar, mr. potter.
you like it? i'll send you a box.
yes. well, most people say you stole all the rest.
the envious ones say that, george, the suckers. now, i have stated my side very frankly. now, let's look at your side. young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
you wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to new york a year, maybe once in a while europe. you wouldn't mind that, would you, george?
would i?  you're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? you know, this is me, you remember me? george bailey.
oh, yes, george bailey. whose ship has just come in –– providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
well, what about the building and loan?
oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? i'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. is it a deal or isn't it?
well, mr. potter, i . . . i . . . i know i ought to jump at the chance, but i . . . i just . . . i wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
sure, sure, sure. you go on home and talk about it to your wife.
i'd like to do that.
in the meantime, i'll draw up the papers.
all right, sir.
hi.
hi.
mary hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
to keep from being an old maid.
you could have married sam wainwright or anybody else in town.
i didn't want to marry anybody else in town. i want my baby to look like you.
you didn't even have a honeymoon. i promised you . . .  . . . your what?
my baby.
george bailey lassos stork.
lassos the stork! you mean you . . . what is it, a boy or a girl?
now, you've probably already guessed that george never leaves bedford falls.
no!
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
yes, but george . . .
on v-j day he wept and prayed again.
joseph, now show him what happened today.
yes, sir.
good morning, sir.
carter –– bank examiner.
mr. carter, merry christmas.
merry christmas.
we're all excited around here.  my brother just got the congressional medal of honor. the president just decorated him.
well, i guess they do those things. well, i trust you had a good year.
good year? well, between you and me, mr. carter, we're broke.
yeah, very funny.
well . . .  . . . now, come right in here, mr. carter.
i guess you forgot something.
huh?
you forgot something.
what?
well, aren't you going to make a deposit?
sure, sure i am.
well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
oh, shucks . . .
how about that one there?
hmm? well, i . . .
george, can i see you for a second?
why, of course you can. come on in the office here.
no, george, don't . . .
here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
i know, but . . .
what do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? want to walk to new york? you know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in bedford falls.
say hello to new york for me.
yeah –– yeah . . . sure i will.
now, let's hear from you . . .
now look, did you buy anything?
nothing. not even a stick of gum.
all right. all right. now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
this way.
and did you put the envelope in your pocket?
yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
is it snowing?
yeah, just started.
where's your coat and hat?
left them at the office.
zuzu! what's the matter with zuzu?
oh, she's got a cold. she's in bed. caught it coming home from school. they gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
what is it, a sore throat or what?
just a cold. the doctor says it's nothing serious.
the doctor? was the doctor here?
yes, i called him right away. he says it's nothing to worry about.
is she running a temperature? what is it?
just a teensie one –– ninety-nine, six. she'll be all right.
where're you going?
going up to see zuzu.
hi, daddy.
well, what happened to you?
i won a flower.
wait now. where do you think you're going?
want to give my flower a drink.
all right, all right. here, give daddy the flower. i'll give it a drink.
look, daddy . . . paste it.
yeah, all right. now, i'll paste this together.
there it is, good as new.
give the flower a drink.
what?
will you try to get some sleep?
i'm not sleepy. i want to look at my flower.
i know –– i know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
it will?
uh-huh.
yes, sir.
have you notified the police?
no, sir. i didn't want the publicity. harry's homecoming tomorrow . . .
no, sir. no, sir. i haven't.
what is it –– a woman, then? you know, it's all over town that you've been giving money to violet bick.
not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? why don't you go to sam wainwright and ask him for the money?
i can't get hold of him. he's in europe.
well, what about all your other friends?
they don't have that kind of money, mr. potter. you know that. you're the only one in town that can help me.
i see. i've suddenly become quite important. what kind of security would i have, george? have you got any stocks?
yes . . . how much is your equity in it?
five hundred dollars.
he's gone. don't worry. his name is welch. he don't come in to my place no more.
oh –– welch. that's what i get for praying.
the last time he come in here. you hear that, nick?
yes, you bet.
where's my insurance policy?  oh, here . . .
oh, no, please, don't go out this way, mr. bailey.
i'm all right.
oh, no –– you don't feel so good.
i'm all right.
please don't go away –– please!
you what? to save me?
well, i did, didn't i? you didn't go through with it, did you?
go through with what?
suicide.
oh, i know all about you. i've watched you grow up from a little boy.
what are you, a mind reader or something?
oh, no.
well, who are you, then?
clarence odbody, a-s-2.
odbody . . . a-s-2. what's that a-s-2?
angel, second class.
that's what i was sent down for. i'm your guardian angel.
i wouldn't be a bit surprised.
ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money. eight thousand dollars.
i told you –– i'm your guardian angel. i know everything about you.
well, you look about like the kind of an angel i'd get. sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? what happened to your wings?
i haven't won my wings yet. that's why i'm an angel second class.
i don't know whether i like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
oh, i've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?
by letting me help you.
only one way you can help me. you don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
oh, no, no. we don't use money in heaven.
oh, that's right, i keep forgetting. comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
oh, tut, tut, tut.
i found it out a little late. i'm worth more dead than alive.
now look, you mustn't talk like that. i won't get my wings with that attitude. you just don't know all that you've done. if it hadn't been for you . . .
what'd you say?
i said i wish i'd never been born.
oh, you mustn't say things like that. you . . .  . . . wait a minute. wait a minute. that's an idea.  what do you think? yeah, that'll do it. all right.  you've got your wish. you've never been born.
what did you say?
you've never been born. you don't exist. you haven't a care in the world.
well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . i haven't heard anything out of that ear since i was a kid. must have been that jump in the cold water.
your lip's stopped bleeding, too, george.
it's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? what's happened here?  come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
our clothes are dry.
i can't fly. i haven't got any wings.
you haven't got your wings. yeah, that's right.
you have no car.
well, i had a car, and it was right here. i guess somebody moved it.
oh, i don't know. either i'm off my nut, or he is . . .  . . . or you are!
it isn't me!
well, maybe i left the car up at martini's. well, come on, gabriel.
you want a martini?
no, no, martini. your boss. where is he?
okay –– all right. double bourbon, quick, huh?
okay.  what's yours?
what's the matter with him. i never saw nick act like that before.
you'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
oh, yeah. hey, little fellow –– you worry me. you got someplace to sleep?
no.
you don't huh? well, you got any money?
no.
no wonder you jumped in the river.
i jumped in the river to save you so i could get my wings.
oh-oh. somebody's just made it.
made what?
every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
look, i think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
why? don't they believe in angels?
that does it! out you two pixies go, through the door or out the window!
look, nick. what's wrong?
well, nick, that's your name, isn't it?
what's that got to do with it? i don't know you from adam's off ox.  hey, you! rummy! come here! come here!
mr. gower! mr. gower! this is george bailey! don't you know me?
no. no.
you see, george, you were not there to stop gower from putting that poison into the . . .
what do you mean, i wasn't there? i remember distinctly . . .
yeah, yeah, i know. you told me that. what else are you? what . . . are you a hypnotist?
no, of course not.
well then, why am i seeing all these strange things?
don't you understand, george? it's because you were not born.
then if i wasn't born, who am i?
you're nobody. you have no identity.
what do you mean, no identity? my name's george bailey.
there is no george bailey. you have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-f card, no insurance policy . . .
what?
zuzu's petals.
hey . . . hey. where did the building and loan move to?
the building and what?
the bailey building and loan. it was up there.
they went out of business years ago.
hey, violet!  hey, listen –– that's violet bick!
i know. i know.
i know that girl!
aw, now, doggone it, ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. you know where i live. three-twenty sycamore. now hurry up.
okay. three-twenty sycamore? . . .
yeah –– yeah –– hurry up. zuzu's sick.
all right.
look, bud, what's the idea? i live in a shack in potter's field and my wife ran away three years ago and took the kid . . . and i ain't never seen you before in my life.
okay. just step on it. just get me home.
is this the place?
of course it's the place.
well, this house ain't been lived in for twenty years.
all right, put up your hands. no fast moves. come on out here, both of you.
bert! thank heaven you're here!
stand back.
bert, what's happened to this house? where's mary? where's my kids?
bert, now listen to me. ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? bert, listen!  it's that fellow there –– he says he's an angel –– he's tried to hypnotize me.
i hate to do this, fella.
well?
mother . . .
mother? what do you want?
oh, mother, mother, please help me. something terrible's happened to me. i don't know what it is. something's happened to everybody. please let me come in. keep me here until i get over it.
get over what? i don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by somebody i know.
well, sure i do.
when'd you see him last?
today, over at the house.
that's a lie. he's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his business. and if you ask me, that's where you belong.
you know where he lives?
sure i know where he lives. he lives in bailey park.
are you sure this is bailey park?
oh, i'm not sure of anything anymore. all i know is this should be bailey park. but where are the houses?
clarence . . .
yes, george?
where's mary?
oh, well, i can't . . .
i don't know how you know these things, but tell me –– where is she?
i . . .
if you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
i'm not supposed to tell.
she's . . .
where is she?
what the sam hill you yelling for, george?
don't . . . george?
know you? are you kiddin'? i've been looking all over town trying to find you. i saw your car piled into that tree down there, and i thought maybe . . . hey, your mouth's bleeding; are you sure you're all right?
what did . . .
daddy!
zuzu –– zuzu. my little gingersnap! how do you feel?
fine.
mary! mary!
george, darling! where have you been?
oh, george, george, george.
mary! let me touch you! oh, you're real!
oh, george, george!
you have no idea what's happened to me.
you have no idea what happened . . .
violet bick!
i'm not going to go, george. i changed my mind.
hello, george, how are you?
harry . . . harry . . .
