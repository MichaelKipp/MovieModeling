ow!!
i thought you said no more aches and pains?
it is this darned corset. it binds. he retrieves the stick.
no three-way stretch? how very un- chic.
well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style.  ah, tomorrow!
what is tomorrow?
tomorrow... the corset comes off. and this thing goes out the window.  i shall be a free man. i shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
more than you think.
how do you know? personal experience?
please!  and what happens after tomorrow?
what do you mean?
what are you going to do? now that you have quit the police force?
you sound so disapproving, midge.
no, it is your life. but you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
i had to quit, midge.
why?
i wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
it was not your fault.
i know. everybody tells me.
johnny, the doctors explained --
i know. i have acrophobia. what a disease. a fear of heights. and what a moment to find out i had it.
well, you have got it. and there is no losing it. and there is no one to blame. so why quit?
and sit behind a desk?  chairborne?
it is where you belong.
not with my acrophobia, midge. if i dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
ah, johnny-o...
well?... what will you do?
nothing for a while. you forget, I am a man of independent means. or fairly independent.
mmm. why do not you go away for a while?
to forget? do not be so motherly, midge. I am not going to crack up.
have you had any dizzy spells this week?
I am having one now.
from that music.
oh!
it is a brassiere. you know about those things. you are a big boy, now.
I have never run across one like that.
it is brand new. revolutionary uplift. no shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. it works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
uh-huh!
an aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. he worked it out in his spare time.
what a pleasant hobby.
how is your love life, midge?
that is following a train of thought.
well?
normal.
are not you ever going to get married?
you know there is only one man in the world for me, johnny-o.
yeah, I am a brute. we were engaged once though, were not we?
three whole weeks.
ah, sweet college days. but you are the one who blew it. I am still available. available ferguson. say, midge, do you remember a guy at college named gavin elster?
gavin? gavin elster? you would think I would would. no.
i got a call from him today. funny. he dropped out of sight during the war, and I would heard he would gone east. i guess he is back.  it is a mission number.
that is skid row... is not it?
could be.
he is probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
well, I am on the bum; I will buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. but not tonight. if you will not drink with me, I will drink alone, tonight.
sorry, old man. work.
midge, what did you mean, there is no losing it?
what.
my... the acrophobia.
i asked my doctor. he said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. and you are not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
i think i can lick it.
how?
I have got a theory. look. if i can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see?
here, I will show you what i mean. we will start with this.
that!?!
what do you want me to start with -- the golden gate bridge?
now. i look up, i look down. i look up, i look down. nothing to it.
stop kidding. wait a minute.
step number two.
okay.
easy, now.
this is a cinch. i look up, i look down. i look up --
johnny!
oh, damn it! damn it, damn it --
how did you get into the shipbuilding business, gavin?
i married into it.
interesting business.
no, to be honest, i find it dull.
you do not have to do it for a living.
no. but one assumes obligations. my wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. her father's partner runs the company yard in the east -- baltimore -- so i decided as long as i had to work at it, I would come back here. I have always liked it here.
how long have you been back?
almost a year.
and you like it.
san francisco's changed. the things a that spell san francisco to me are disappearing fast.
like all this.
I would like to have lived here then. the color and excitement... the power...  the freedom.
should not you be sitting down?
no, I am all right.
i was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  and you have quit the force.  a permanent physical disability?
no, acrophobia is not a crippling thing. it just means i can not climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the top-of-the-mark. but --  -- there are plenty of street-level bars in this town.
would you like a drink now?
no... no, thanks. a bit early in the day for spirits.  well, i guess that about covers everything, does not it? i never married; i do not see much of the "old college gang"; I am a retired detective -- and you are in the shipbuilding business.  what is on your mind, gavin?
not what you think. we are very happily married.
then?
I am afraid some harm may come to her.
from whom?
someone dead.
scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
no.
if i told you i believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
I would say you would better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. and have him check you both.
then you are of no use to me. I am sorry i wasted your time. thank you for coming in, scottie.
i did not mean to be that rough.
no, it sounds idiotic, i know. and you are still the hard-headed scot, are not you? always were. do you think I am making it up?
no.
I am not making it up. i would not know how. she will be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone i do not know. i call to her and she does not hear. and then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and does not know she is been away... can not tell me where... or why...
how often does this happen?
more and more in the past few weeks. and she wanders. god knows where she wanders. i followed her one day.
where did she go?
watched her come out of the apartment, someone i did not know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way i did not know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  golden gate park. five miles. she sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the portals of the past. sat there a long time, not moving... and i had to leave, to got to the office. that evening, when i came home, i asked what she would done all day. she said she would driven to golden gate park and sat by the lake. that is all.
well?
the speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. where did she go?  i have to know, scottie. where she goes and what she does, before i got involved with doctors.
have you talked to the doctors at all?
yes, but carefully. I would want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  scottie --
i can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. they are dependable, good boys --
i want you.
it is not my line.
scottie, i need a friend!  someone i can trust! I am in a panic about this!
how can i see her, to know her?
we are going to an opening at the opera tonight. we will dine at ernie's first.  which is easier?
ernie's.
all right.  you will not know what to look for at first, scottie. even i, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. she looks so lovely and normal...
is there something i can do for you?
yes... you run this hotel.
oh, yes!
would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
oh, I am afraid we could not give out information of that sort. our clients are entitled to their privacy, you know. and i do believe it is against the law! of course, i do not think any of them would mind, really, but still i would have to know who you are, and ask --
oh, dear! has she done something wrong?
please answer my question.
i can not imagine that sweet girl with that dear face --
what is her name?
valdes. miss valdes.  it is spanish, you know.
carlotta valdes?
yes, that is it. sweet name, is not it?  foreign. but sweet.
how long has she had the room?
oh, it must be two weeks. yes, the rent's due tomorrow.
does she sleep here? ever?
no... she only comes to sit. two or three times a week. and i never ask questions, you know. as long as they are well behaved. i must say that I have wondered --
when she comes down, do not say that I have been here.
oh, but she has not been here today. scottie whirls back on her.
i saw her come in five minutes. ago.
oh, no! she has not been here at all! i would have seen her, you know. I have been right here all the time, putting olive oil on my rubber plant leaves!
and there! there you see? her key is on the rack!
would you please go and look?
in her room? well, yes, of course if you ask. but it does seem silly...
her car is gone.
what car?
now, that is the kind of greeting a girl likes.  none of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. just a good straight "who do you know" --
well, who? come on, you know everybody.
professor saunders, over in berkeley.
not that kind of history. the small stuff! about people you never heard of!
oh!  you mean gay old bohemian days of gay old san francisco!  the juicy stories? like who shot who in the embarcadero august, 1879?
yeah.
pop leibel.
who?
pop leibel owns the argosy book shop. what do you want to know?
who shot who in the embarcadero in august, 1879.
wait a minute! you are not a detective any more. what is going on?
do you know him well?
pop leibel? sure.
all right, come on. introduce me. where is your hat?
yes... the beautiful carlotta... the sad carlotta...
what does a big old wooden house on the corner of eddy and gough street have to do with her?
it was hers. it was built for her. many years ago.
by whom?
by... no... the name i do not remember. a rich man, a powerful man.  it is not an unusual story. she came from somewhere small, to the south of the city... some say from a mission settlement... young, yes; very young.  and she was found singing and dancing in a cabaret by the man... wait... wait... ives! his name was ives!  yes. and he took her and built for her this great house in the western addition... and there was a child. yes. this was it. the child.
the poor thing....
and she died...
she died.
how?
by her own hand.  there are many such stories.
thank you, mr. leibel. thank you very much.
now then, johnny-o; pay me.
for what?
for bringing you here. come on, tell!
nothing to tell.
you will tell, or you will be back in that corset! come on!
I will take you home.
here you are.
you have not told me everything.
I have told you enough.
who is the guy, who is the wife?
out. I have got things to do.
i know. the one who phoned. your old college chum, elster.
out!
and the idea is that the beautiful mad carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of elster's wife?  ah, johnny! come on!
I am not telling you what i think! I am telling you what he thinks!
think?  well, what do you think?
is she pretty?
carlotta?
no, not carlotta. elster's wife.
mmm, yeah, i guess...
midge!
bye-bye!
you have done well, scottie. you are good at your job.
that is carlotta valdes.
yes.
there are things you did not tell me.
i did not know where she was going to lead you.
but you knew about this.
oh, yes. you noticed the way she does her hair.
something else. my wife, madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to carlotta. she inherited them. never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
carlotta valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
great-grandmother. the child who was taken from her whose loss drove carlotta mad and to her death - was madeleine's grandmother.
well, that explains it. anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
but she does not know, about her background.  she never heard of carlotta valdes.
knows nothing of a grave out at mission dolores, or an old house an eddy street, or a portrait at the palace of the legion of honor?
nothing.
and when she goes to those places...
she is not my wife.
how do you know all these things she does not know?
her mother told me most of then before she died. i dug out the rest for myself, here.
why did she never tell her daughter?
natural fear. her grandmother went insane and took her own life. and the blood is in madeleine.  scottie, i ask you to watch her closely.
why am i here? what happened?
you...  ...fell into the bay.
you do not remember.
no...
do you remember where you were?
oh, of course i remember that!  but then i must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
where were you?
at...
...old port point!  out at the presidio! of course i remember! i often go there!
why?
because i love it so. it is beautiful there. especially at sunset.  ah... thank you for the fire.
where had you been before?
when?
this afternoon.
oh... wandering about.
before?  where?  where had you been?
please drink your coffee.
i will. you are terribly direct in your questions.
I am sorry. i did not mean to be rude.
you are not. merely direct. what were you doing there? at old fort point?
wandering about.
you like it, too.
the palace of the legion of honor. the art gallery.
oh, that is a lovely spot, is not it? I have never been inside. but it looks so lovely, driving past.
lucky for me you were wandering about. thank you again. I have been terrible bother to you.
no.
when you...  there were pins in my hair...
oh! yes! here!
you should not have brought me here, you know.
i... did not know where you lived.
you could have looked in my car. oh, but you did not know my car, did you?
yes, i knew which one it was. it is out there, now. but i did not think you would want to be brought home that way.
no, you are right,  I am glad you did not take me home... i would not have known you, to thank you...  oh, but i do not know you! and you do not know me! my name is madeleine elster.
my name is john ferguson.
that is a good, strong name. do your friends call you john? or jack.
john. old friends. acquaintances call me scottie.
i shall call you mr. ferguson.
no, i would not like that. and after what happened today i should think you could call me scottie. or even john.
i prefer john. there, that is done.  and what do you do, john?
wander about.
that is a good occupation. and live here... alone?
one should not live alone.
some people prefer it.
no... it is wrong.
will you tell me something? has this ever happened to you before?
what?
...falling... into san francisco bay?
no, never before. I have fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when i was a little girl. and i fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. but I have never fallen into san francisco bay. have you? ever before?
no... this is the first time for me, too.
hello.
scottie, what happened? she is not home, yet.
no, she is all right. she is still here. but I will get her home soon.
what happened?
she... went into the bay.
hello?
did she hurt herself?
no. she is in fine shape. nothing to worry about. but she does not know. you understand that. she does not know what she did.
oh! yes. hello.
good morning. i worried about you, last night. you should not have run like that.
i... suddenly felt such a fool.
i wanted to drive you home. are you all right?
oh, yes. fine. no after effects.  but as i remember now, that water was cold, was not it?  what a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  it is a formal thank-you letter. and a great big apology.
you have nothing to apologize for.
oh, yes! the whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
not at all, i enjoyed --
-- talking to you...
i enjoyed talking to you.
would you like some coffee?
no! no, thank you!
i could not mail it; i did not know your address. but i had a landmark. i remembered coit tower and it led me straight to you.
the first time I have been grateful for coit tower.
i hope we will, too.
what?
meet again, sometime.
we have.
good-bye.
good-bye.
i do not know.
shopping?
no.
well... anywhere in particular?
no, i just thought I would wander.
ah.  that is what i was going to do.
oh, yes, i forgot: it is your occupation, is not it?
do not you think it is sort of a waste for the two of us to...
wander separately? ah, but only one is a wanderer. two, together, are always going somewhere.
no... no, i do not think that is necessarily true.
do you know where you are going?
of course not! I am a wanderer!  I would like to go somewhere I have never been!
how can you be sure?
if I have been there? that is silly! either you have been to a place or you haven't.
how old?
oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
the oldest living things?
what are you thinking?
of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
their true name is sequoia sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
i do not like them.
why?
knowing i have to die...
do you hear anything?
only silence. it is always like this.
and no birds sing.
no birds live here.
no.
would you like a drink of water?
no, thank you.
somewhere in here i was born... and here i died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
madeleine!
where are you now?
here with you.
where?
the tall trees...
have you been here before?
yes...
when?
where were you born?
long ago...
where?
no!... no!
tell me what it is. where do you go? what takes you away?
no, do not ask me!
when you jumped in the bay, you did not know where you were. you guessed but you did not know.
i did not jump, i fell! you told me i fell!
why did you jump?
no!
what was it inside that told you to jump?
no, i can not tell you!
what?!
no! please! please, please, please, please, do not ask me!
take me away from here?
home?
...somewhere in the light.
I am responsible for you now, you know.  the chinese say that once you have saved someone is life, you are responsible for it forever. and so I am committed. and i have to know.
and you will go on saving me? again and again?
there is so little i know. it is as though i were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things i have never done... but still me... and i can not stop to ask why, i must keep on walking. at the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and i know when i walk into the darkness, I will die.  but I have never come to the and; I have always come back, before then. except once.
yesterday.
but the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
vaguely...
what do you remember?
a room... there is a room, and i sit there alone... always alone...
would you know the room?
no... it is in shadow.
what else?
a grave...
where?
i do not know. an open grave. i stand by the gravestone looking down into it. and it is my grave.
how do you know?
i know.
there is a name on the gravestone.
no. it is new and clean, and waiting.
what else?
this part is dream, i think. there is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in spain... a village in spain. and then it clicks off, and is gone.
a portrait? do you ever see a portrait?
no.
of the woman in the mirror. would you know her if you saw her?
but I am the woman in the mirror!
no!
if i could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
and so explain it away?  but there is a way to explain it, you see. if I am mad? that would explain it, would not it?
I am not mad. I am not mad. and i do not want to die, but there is someone inside me, there is a somebody else, and she says i must die... scottie, do not let me go!
I am here, I have got you...
I am so afraid...  ...you will not let it happen...
do not leave me... stay with me...
all the time.
i did. since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
since i stopped being able to get them on the phone. for a man who has nothing to do, you are certainly a busy little bee. where do you go, these days?
just wander.
where?
around.
oh?
mm. better.
did you need it?
yeah.
oh?
what was this desperate urge to see me?
all i said in the note was: "where are you?" that does not sound desperate to me.
well, i detected an undercurrent.
i just thought if i gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you would be so grateful you would take me to a movie.
fair enough. what will we talk about at dinner?
oh... this and that.
what I have been doing?
if you want to. naturally, we will not talk about anything you do not want to talk about.
naturally.
what have you been doing?
wandering.
oh, I am having a wonderful time! I have gone back to my first love... painting.
good. I have always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
well, it is a living. but I am excited about this.
what is it, a still life?
no, not exactly. want to see?
as a matter of fact, i thought i might give it to you.
oh?
i should have phoned... but i wanted to see you... be with you...
why? what is happened?
i had the dream. the dream came back again...
no, do not go away!
only this far.
where is your husband?
i did not wake him. i do not want him to know...
it was a dream, you are awake, you are all right, now. can you tell me?
it was the tower again... and the bell, and the old spanish village...
yes --
but clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
tell me.
there was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed spanish church with a cloister. across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
go on.
at the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old california days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
yes?! but --
it is all there. it is no dream.
you have been there before. you have seen it.
no, never!
madeleine, a hundred miles south of san francisco there is an old spanish mission, mission san juan bautista. it is been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. now, think hard, darling. you have been there before. you have seen it!
no, never! I have never been there! scottie, what is it? I have never been there!
go on with your dream. what was it that frightened you?
i stood alone on the green, searching for something, and i started to walk to the church. but then the darkness closed in, i was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and i fought to wake up...
here with you.
and it is a all real.
yes.
not merely as it was a hundred years ago. as it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it.  madeleine, think of when you were here!
my love... because i love you.
i love you too... too late... too late...
no... we are together...
too late... there is something i must do...
there are things i have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. but they can wait. the only important thing now is that i love you and I am going to keep you safe.
you can't.
why?
let me go.
where?
to the church, i must go there.
madeleine --
please let me go.
it is not fair, it is too late. it was not supposed to happen this way, it should not have happened...!
it had to. we are in love. that is all that counts. madeleine --
let me go! let me go!!
madeleine!!
you believe that i love you?
yes.
and if you lose me, you will know that i loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
i will not lose you.
let me go into the church alone.
why?
please. because i love you.  he stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. she turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. he watches her go and starts to move after her. then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her.  and then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run.
he had no right to say that. it was my responsibility. you did not know her. i should not have got you involved.
i -- i --
no, there is nothing you have to say to me. I am getting out, scottie. for good. i can not stay here. I am winding up her affairs, and mine. I am going to get as far away as i can. probably europe. and I will probably never come back.  good-bye, scottie. if there is anything i can do for you before i go...
doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
it is hard to say. six months, at least. perhaps a year. it depends to a certain extent on him.
he will not talk.
no. we have ways of digging out knowledge. but it takes longer. he is suffering from acute melancholia, together with a guilt complex. he blames himself for what happened to the woman. and we know little of the background.
i can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
ah? that complicates the problem.
I will give you another complication: he still is.
could i ask you a couple of questions?
what for? who are you?
my name is john ferguson, and --
is this some kind of gallup poll, or something?
no, there are just a few things i want to ask you, and --
do you live here in the hotel?
no, i happened to see you come in, and i thought --
0h, i thought so! a pick-up!  well, you have got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! you beat it! go on! beat it!
no, please! i just want to talk to you!
listen, I am going to yell in a minute!
I am not going to hurt you! i promise! please!
just let me talk to you.
what about?
you.
why?
I have heard that one before, too. i remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you have been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  huh!
you are not far wrong.
well, it is not going to work. so you would better go.
let me come in.
i warn you, i can yell awfully loud.
you will not have to.
well... you do not look very much like jack the ripper...
what do you want to know?
your name. and --
judy barton.
who you are --
just a girl, i work at magnin's --
-- and how you happen to be living here.
it is a place to live, that is all.
but you have not lived here long.
about three years.
no, a year ago! where did you live a year ago!!?
i told you! right here!
but before! where did you live before!?!
salina, kansas!
listen, what is this? what do you want?
i want to know who you are.
i told you! my name is judy barton! i come from salina kansas. i work at magnin's! i live here! my gosh, do i have to prove it?
will you have dinner with me?
why?
well, i feel i owe you something for all this...
no, you do not owe me anything.
then will you for me?
dinner... and what else?
just dinner.
because i remind you of her?
because I would like to have dinner with you.
well... I have been on blind dates before... matter of fact, to be honest, I have been picked up before.  okay.
I will get my car and be back in half an hour.
oh, no! give me time to change and get fixed up!
an hour?
mmm.
okay.
thank you again. good-night.
can i see you tomorrow?
tomorrow night? well --
tomorrow morning.
tomorrow m -- but i have to go to work. I have got a job.
do not go.
and what will i live on? my oil wells in texas?
I will take care of you.
oh, well, thank very much. but no thanks.
no, judy, you do not understand.
oh, i understand, all right. I have been understanding since i was seventeen. and the next step is, as long as you are going to see me tomorrow, why do not you stay the night.
no.
no? then what?
i just want to see you as much as i can!
as friends? we would just see a lot of each other as friends, and you would "take care of me"?
yes.
why?  because i remind you of someone?  that is not very complimentary.  and nothing would... happen...
no.
that is not very complimentary, either.
no, judy, I am not going to move! please! stay in the chair!
why?!
please! and do not look at me.
will you, judy?
i suppose i could phone the store in the morning, and say I am sick.
i like that one.
no, there. there is a good one. do you like that?
yes --
okay. now we are going to buy you some clothes.
honest?
there is ransohoff's. nothing but the best. come on.
but scottie, you do not have to!
i want to! come on!
no, that is not it. nothing like it.
but you said grey, sir.
not tweed -- it is a smoother material, with a larger collar and belted.
but i like that one, scottie.
no, it is not right.
scottie, what are you doing?
I am trying to buy you a suit.
but i loved the second one she wore. and this one --  -- is beautiful.
they are none of them right.
but why?
you want me to dress like her?
judy, i just want you to look nice. and i know what kind of suit would look well on you.
ah, no!!! i do not want to be dressed like someone dead!
judy --
it is a horrible idea! is that what I am here for? to make you feel that you are with someone that is dead?
she will be out in a moment.
now, judy, it is not anything to get --
judy, it can not make much difference to you. i just want to see how you would look and i know it will not be the same, but --
no, i do not want any clothes! i do not want anything! i want to get out of here!
judy, you have got to do this for me! please!
yes! that is it!
i thought so!
i do not like it!
we will take it! will it fit?
oh, yes! it may need some slight alterations, but it is madam's size.  all right, dear.  we will have it for you to try in a moment.
how soon can it be altered?
well...
can we have it by tonight?
well, if it is absolutely necessary...
yes, it is. now, i want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this...  ...and the skirt out.
i wish you would leave me alone. i want to go away.
you can.
no, you would not let me.  and i do not want to go...
judy, i want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I have had in a year.
i know. because i remind you of her. the one that is dead. and not even that, very much.
no, it is you too, judy. something in you.
you do not even want to touch me.
yes. yes, i do.
the color of your hair...
ah, no!
judy, please it can not matter to you...
the trouble is, I am gone now. for you. and i can not do anything about it. i want you to love me. if i let you change me, will that do it? if i do what you tell me, will you love me?
yes.
all right. then I will do it. because i do not care about me anymore. i just want you to love me.
well?
it should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. i told them. i told you.
we tried it. it did not suit me.
where shall we go for dinner?
wherever you would like...
ernie's?
you have got a thing about ernie's, have not you?
well, after all, it is "our place."
mmmm.
is that the best you can do?
come here.
oh, no. you will muss me.
that is what i had in mind.
too late. I have got my face on.
I am suddenly hungry. would you rather go somewhere else?
no, ernie's is fine.
I am going to have one of those big beautiful steaks.  and... let's see... to start...
I have got it.  he bends down and bites the back of her neck.
oh! you are supposed to fasten it!
all in good time.
scottie!
how does it work?
can not you see?
oh, yeah. there.
we are going awfully far.
i feel like driving. are you terrible hungry?
no, it is all right.
where are you going?
to complete my cure.
scottie, why are we here?
i told you. i have to go back into the past. once more. for the last time.
but why? why here?
madeleine died here.
no, i do not want to go. i want to stay here.
i need you.
why?
i can not do it alone. i need you, to be madeleine for a while. then, when it is done, we will both be free.
I am scared.
so am i, but it has to be done. i have to tell you about madeleine, now.
...we stood there and i kissed her for the last time. and she said, "if lose me, you will know that i loved you --
scottie --
-- and wanted to go on loving you." and i said, "i will not lose you."  but i did.
and i could not follow her.  god knows i tried.  one does not often get a second chance. i want to stop being haunted. you are my second chances, judy.
take me away...
you look like madeleine, now. go up the stairs.
no!
go up the stairs, judy.  I will follow.
we are going up the tower, madeleine.
no! let me go!
we are going up the tower.
you can't. you are afraid!
I am going to. it is my second chance.
scottie, please...!
but you knew, that day, that i would not be able to follow you did not you. who was at the top when you got there? elster? with his wife?
yes!
and she was the one who died. not you.  the real wife.  you were the copy, you were the counterfeit. was she dead or alive when you got there?
dead. he would broken her neck.
took no chances, did he?  and when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? but you were the one who screamed. why did you scream?
i wanted to stop it, i ran up to stop it --
why? since you would tricked me so well up to then?!! you played his wife so well, judy! he made you over, did not he? just as I have done. but better! not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! those beautiful phony trances! that jump into the bay! I will bet you are really a strong swimmer, are not you! are not you!!
did he train you? rehearse you? teach you what to say and what to do?
yes!
and you were such an apt pupil! what fun you two must have had, playing games with me! why me? why did he pick on me?!!
your accident...
ah, yes! i was a set-up. i was the made-to-order witness. where is he now?
i do not know... switzerland?
we will find him.
i made it.
what are you going to do?
look at the scene of the crime. go on in.
oh, judy!! when he had all her money, and the freedom and the power...  he ditched you? what a shame! but he knew he was safe. you could not talk. did not he give you anything?
some money.
and the necklace. carlotta's necklace. that was your mistake, judy. one should not keep souvenirs of a killing. you should not have been that sentimental.
what are you going to do?
i loved you, madeleine.
i was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! but when i saw you again i could not run away, i loved you so! i walked into danger and let you change me again because i loved you and wanted you!  scottie, please! you love me now! love me! keep me safe!
love me... keep me safe...
too late... too late... there is no bringing her back.
