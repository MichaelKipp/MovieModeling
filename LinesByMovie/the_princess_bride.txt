you feeling any better?
a little bit.
guess what.
what?
your grandfather's here.
mom, can not you tell him that I am sick?
you are sick, that is why he is here.
he will pinch my cheek. i hate that.
maybe he won't.
i brought you a special present.
what is it?
open it up.
a book?
that is right. when i was your age, television was called books. and this is a special book. it was the book my father used to read to me when i was sick, and i used to read it to your father. and today, I am going to read it to you.
has it got any sports in it?
it does not sound too bad. I will try and stay awake.
oh. well, thank you very much. it is very nice of you. your vote of confidence is overwhelming. all right.  the princess bride, by s. morgenstern. chapter one. buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of florin.
her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. his name was westley, but she never called him that.  is not that a wonderful beginning?
yeah. it is really good.
nothing gave buttercup as much pleasure as ordering westley around.
farm boy. polish my horse's saddle. i want to see my face shining in it by morning.
as you wish.
farm boy. fill these with water --  --please.
as you wish.
-hold it, hold it-
what is this? are you trying to trick me? -- where is the sports? -- is this a kissing book?
-- wait, just wait --
-- well, when does it get good?
keep your shirt on. let me read.  westley had no money for marriage. so he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.
it was a very emotional time for buttercup --
i do not be-leeve this.
i fear I will never see you again.
of course you will.
but what if something happens to you?
hear this now: i will come for you.
but how can you be sure?
this is true love. you think this happens every day?
westley did not reach his destination. his ship was attacked by the dread pirate roberts, who never left captives alive. when buttercup got the news that westley was murdered --
-- murdered by pirates is good --
it is fabric from the uniform of an army officer of guilder.
who is guilder?
the country across the sea. the sworn enemy of florin.  go!
once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the prince suspect the guilderians have abducted his love. when he finds her body dead on the guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
you never said anything about killing anyone.
I have hired you to help me start a war. that is a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
i just do not think it is right, killing an innocent girl.
am i going mad or did the word "think" escape your lips? you were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass.
probably he means no harm.
he is really very short on charm.
oh, you have a great gift for rhyme.
yes, some of the time.
fezzik, are there rocks ahead?
if there are, we will all be dead.
no more rhymes now, i mean it.
anybody want a peanut?
making sure nobody's following us.
that would be inconceivable.
stop doing that. we can all relax, it is almost over-
you are sure nobody's following us?
as i told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. no one in guilder knows what we have done. and no one in florin could have gotten here so fast. out of curiosity, why do you ask?
no reason. it is only, i just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
what?
go in, get after her!
i do not swim. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           15.
i only dog paddle.
veer left. left. left!
what?
the eel does not get her. I am explaining to you because you looked nervous.
well, i was not nervous.
well, maybe i was a little bit concerned. but that is not the same thing.
because i can stop now if you want.
no. you could read a little bit more ... if you want. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           17.
look! he is right on top of us. i wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
whoever he is, he is too late --  -- see?  the cliffs of insanity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           19.
he is climbing the rope. and he is gaining on us.
inconceivable!
faster!
i thought i was going faster.
you were supposed to be this colossus. you were this great, legendary thing. and yet he gains.
well, I am carrying three people. and he is got only himself.
-- i do not accept excuses.  I am just going to have to find myself a new giant, that is all.
do not say that, vizzini. please.
he did not fall? inconceivable!!
you keep using that word -- i do not think it means what you think it means.  my god! he is climbing.
i want to duel him left-handed.
you know what a hurry we are in.
well, it is the only way i can be satisfied. if i use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
oh, have it your way.
you be careful.  -- people in masks cannot be trusted.
I am waiting!
slow going?
look, i do not mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. so I would appreciate it if you would not distract me.
sorry.
thank you.
i do not suppose you could speed things up?
if you are in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           26.
i could do that. in fact, I have got some rope up here. but i do not think that you will accept my help, since i am only waiting around to kill you.
that does put a damper on our relationship.
but i promise i will not kill you until you reach the top.
that is very comforting. but I am afraid you will just have to wait.
i hate waiting. i could give you my word as a spaniard.
no good. I have known too many spaniards.
you do not know any way you will trust me?
nothing comes to mind.
we will wait until you are ready.
again. thank you.
do you always begin conversations this way?
my father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. he was a great swordmaker, my father. and when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. he slaved a year before he was done.
how old were you?
i was eleven years old. when i was strong enough, i dedicated my life to the study of fencing. so the next time we meet, i will not fail. i will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "hello, my name is inigo montoya. you killed my father. prepare to die."
you have done nothing but study swordplay?
more pursuit than study lately. you see, i cannot find him. it is been twenty years now. i am starting to lose confidence. i just work for vizzini to pay the bills. there is not a lot of money in revenge.
well, i certainly hope you find him, someday.
you are ready, then?
whether i am or not, you have been more than fair. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           30.
you seem a decent fellow. i hate to kill you.
you seem a decent fellow. i hate to die.
begin!
i thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
naturally, you must expect me to attack with capo ferro.
you are wonderful!
thank you -- I have worked hard to become so.
i admit it -- you are better than i am.
then why are you smiling?
because i know something you do not know.
and what is that?
i am not left-handed.
you are amazing!
i ought to be after twenty years.
there is something i ought to tell you.
tell me.
i am not left-handed either.
who are you?!
no one of consequence.
i must know.
get used to disappointment.
okay.
kill me quickly.
i would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. however, since i can not have you following me either --
give her to me.  catch up with us quickly.
what do i do?
finish him, finish him. your way.
oh, good, my way. thank you, vizzini.  which way is my way?
i did that on purpose. i do not have to miss.
i believe you -- so what happens now?
we face each other as god intended. sportsmanlike. no tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
you mean, you will put down your rock and I will put down my sword, and we will try to kill each other like civilized people?
i could kill you now.
frankly, i think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
it is not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. i do not even exercise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           38.
look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
i just want you to feel you are doing well. i hate for people to die embarrassed.
you are quick.
and a good thing too.
why do you wear a mask? were you burned by acid, or something like that? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           39.
why is that, do you think?
well, i have not fought just one person for so long. I have been specializing in groups. battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
why should that make such a difference?
well ...  ... you see, you use different moves when you are fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
there was a mighty duel -- it ranged all over. they were both masters.
who won? how did it end?
the loser ran off alone.  the winner followed those footprints toward guilder!
shall we track them both?
the loser is nothing. -- only the princess matters --  -- clearly this was all planned by warriors of guilder. we must be ready for whatever lies ahead. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           42.
could this be a trap?
i always think everything could be a trap -- which is why I am still alive.
let me explain-
-- there is nothing to explain. you are trying to kidnap what I have rightfully stolen. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           43.
perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
there will be no arrangement --  -- and you are killing her!
but if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
I am afraid so -- i can not compete with you physically. and you are no match for my brains.
you are that smart?
let me put it this way: have you ever heard of plato, aristotle, socrates?
yes.
morons.
really? in that case, i challenge you to a battle of wits.
for the princess?
i accept.
good. then pour the wine.
inhale this, but do not touch.
i smell nothing.
what you do not smell is called iocane powder. it is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
hmm.
now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I am not a great fool, so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. but you must have known i was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
you have made your decision then7
not remotely. because iocane comes from australia, as everyone knows. and australia is entirely peopled with criminals. and criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
wait till i get going! where was i?
australia.
yes -- australia, and you must have suspected i would have known the powder's origin, so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           46.
you are just stalling now.
you would like to think that, would not you?  you have beaten my giant, which means you are exceptionally strong. so, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. but, you have also bested my spaniard which means you must have studied. and in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so i can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
you are trying to trick me into giving away something -- it will not work --
it has worked -- you have given everything away -- i know where the poison is.
then make your choice.
i will. and i choose --
what is so funny?
I will tell you in a minute. first, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
you guessed wrong.
you only think i guessed wrong --  -- that is what is so funny! i switched glasses when your back was turned. you fool.
who are you?
i am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.
to think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
they were both poisoned. i spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
catch your breath.
if you will release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you will get it, i promise you...
and what is that worth, the promise of a woman? you are very funny, highness.
i was giving you a chance. no matter where you take me ... there is no greater hunter than prince humperdinck. he could track a falcon on a cloudy day. he can find you
you think your dearest love will save you? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           50.
i never said he was my dearest love. and yes, he will save me. that i know.
you admit to me you do not love your fiance?
he knows i do not love him.
"are not capable of love" is what you mean.
i have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.
rest, highness.
i know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
you are the dread pirate roberts; admit it.
with pride. what can i do for you?
you can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
hardly complimentary, your highness. why loose your venom on me?
on the high seas, your ship attacked, and the dread pirate roberts never takes prisoners.
i can not afford to make exceptions. once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it is nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
you mock my pain!
life is pain, highness. anyone who says differently is selling something. i remember this farm boy of yours, i think. this would be, what, five years ago?
does it bother you to hear?
nothing you can say will upset me.
he died well, that should please you. no bribe attempts or blubbering. he simply said, "please. please, i need to live." it was the "please" that caught my memory.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           53.
i asked him what was so important for him. "true love," he replied. and then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. i can only assume he meant you. you should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
and what am i?
faithfulness he talked of, madam. your enduring faithfulness. now, tell me truly. when you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
you mocked me once, never do it again -- i died that day!
... as ... you ... wish...
oh, my sweet westley; what have i done?
can you move at all?
move? you are alive. if you want, i can fly.
i told you, "i would always come for you." why did not you wait for me?
well ... you were dead.
death cannot stop true love. all it can do is delay it for a while.
i will never doubt again.
there will never be a need.
oh no. no, please.
what is it? what is the matter? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           56.
they are kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
someday, you may not mind so much.
skip on to the fire swamp -- that sounded good.
oh. you are sick, I will humor you.  so now, where were we here? yeah, yeah, yeah. ah. oh. okay. westley and buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
we will never survive.
nonsense -- you are only saying that because no one ever has. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           57.
singed a bit, were you?
you? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
this will all soon be but a happy memory because roberts' ship "revenge" is anchored at the far end. and i, as you know, am roberts.
but how is that possible, since he is been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
i myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           59.
finally, roberts decided something. he said, "all right, westley, I have never had a valet. you can try it for tonight. I will most likely kill you in the morning." three years he said that. "good night, westley. good work. sleep well. I will most likely kill you in the morning." it was a fine time for me. i was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. and roberts and i eventually became friends. and then it happened.
what? -- go on --
we will never succeed -- we may as well die here.
no. no. we have already succeeded.
i mean, what are the three terrors of the fire swamp? one, the flame spurts. no problem. there is a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. two, the lightning sand. but you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
westley, what about the r.o.u.s.'s?
rodents of unusual size? i do not think they exist...
we did it.
now, was that so terrible? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           64.
you mean you wish to surrender to me? very well, i accept.
i give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool.
ah, but how will you capture us? we know the secrets of the fire swamp. we can live there quite happily for some time. so, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
i tell you once again -- surrender!
it will not happen!
for the last time -- surrender!
death first!!
if we surrender, and i return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
may i live a thousand years and never hunt again.
he is a sailor on the pirate ship "revenge." promise to return him to his ship.
i swear it will be done.
once we are out of sight, take him back to florin and throw him in the pit of despair.
i swear it will be done.
do not even think --  -- do not even think about trying to escape. the chains are far too thick. and do not dream of being rescued either. the only way in is secret. and only the prince, the count, and i know how to get in and out.
then I am here till i die?
till they kill you. yeah.
then why bother curing me?
the prince and the count always insist on everyone being healthy before they are broken.
so it is to be torture.
you do not believe me?
you survived the fire swamp. you must be very brave...  ... but nobody withstands the machine. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           69.
she is been like that ever since the fire swamp.  it is my father's failing health that is upsetting her.
of course.
you read that wrong. she does not marry humperdinck, she marries westley. I am just sure of it. after all that westley did for her, if she does not marry him, it would not be fair.
well, who says life is fair? where is that written? life is not always fair.
I am telling you you are messing up the story, now get it right!
do you want me to go on with this?
yes.
all right, then. no more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. this time as their queen.
it was ten days till the wedding. the king still lived, but buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.
see? did not i tell you she would never marry that rotten humperdinck?
-- yes, you are very smart. shut-up.
i could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  you returned this westley to his ship?
yes.
then we will simply alert him.  beloved, are you certain he still wants you? after all, it was you who did the leaving in the fire swamp. not to mention that pirates are not known to be men of their words.
my westley will always come for me.
i suggest a deal. you write four copies of a letter. I will send my four fastest ships. one in each direction. the dread pirate roberts is always close to florin this time of year. we will run up the white flag and deliver your message. if westley wants you, bless you both. if not ... please consider me as an alternative to suicide. are we agreed?
your princess is really a winning creature. a trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
oh, i know. the people are quite taken with her. it is odd, but when i hired vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, i thought that was clever. but it is going to be so much more moving when i strangle her on our wedding night. once guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. they will demand we go to war.
now, where is that secret knot? it is impossible to find.  are you coming down into the pit? westley's got his strength back. i am starting him on the machine tonight.
tyrone, you know how much i love watching you work. but, I have got my country's five hundredth anniversary to plan, my wedding to arrange, my wife to murder, and guilder to frame for it. I am swamped. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           75.
yellin.
sire.
as chief enforcer of all florin, i trust you with this secret: killers from guilder are infiltrating the thieves' forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night.
my spy network has heard no such news.
he will come for me.
of course.
she will not be murdered. on the day of the wedding, i want the thieves' forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested.
many of the thieves will resist. my regular enforcers will be inadequate.
form a brute squad then. i want the thieves' forest emptied before i wed.
it will not be easy, sire.
try ruling the world sometime.
hello.
it is you.
true!
you do not look so good.  you do not smell so good either.
perhaps not. i feel fine.
yeah?
he is with the prince in the castle. but the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
how many could you handle?
i do not think more than ten.
that leaves twenty for me. at my best, i could never defeat that many.  i need vizzini to plan. i have no gift for strategy. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           82.
no -- not vizzini -- i need the man in black --
-- what? --
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. he bested me with steel. he must have outthought vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. let's go --
-- where?
to find the man in black, obviously.
but you do not know where he is.
do not bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace.
rise and report.
the thieves' forest is emptied. thirty men guard the castle gate.
double it. my princess must be safe.
the gate has but one key, and i carry that.
ah! my dulcet darling. tonight we marry. tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to florin channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon.
every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
every ship but the four you sent.
yes. yes, of course. naturally, not those four.
you never sent the ships. do not bother lying. it does not matter. westley will come for me anyway.
you are a silly girl.
yes, i am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
i-would-not-say-such things-if- iwere-you-
why not? you can not hurt me. westley and i are joined by the bonds of love. and you cannot track that. not with a thousand bloodhounds. and you cannot break it. not with a thousand swords. and when i say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth.
the man in black?
his true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for ultimate suffering?  excuse me --
-- fezzik, please --
everybody ... move!!
westley's only faking, right?
you want me to read this or not?
who gets humperdinck?
i do not understand.
who kills prince humperdinck? at the end, somebody is got to do it. is it inigo? who?
nobody. nobody kills him. he lives. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           90.
no! I am okay. I am okay.  -- sit down. all right?
okay.  all right, now, let's see. where were we? oh yes. in the pit of despair.
well, we montoyas have never taken defeat easily. come along, fezzik. bring the body.
the body?
have you any money?
i have a little.
i just hope it is enough to buy a miracle, that is all. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           91.
what? what?
are you the miracle max who worked for the king all those years?
the king's stinking son fired me. and thank you so much for bringing up such a painful subject. while you are at it, why do not you give me a nice paper cut and pour lemon juice on it? we are closed!
look, I am retired. and besides, why would you want someone the king's stinking son fired? i might kill whoever you wanted me to miracle.
he is already dead.
he is, eh? I will take a look. bring him in.
sir. sir.
hah?
we are really in a terrible rush.
do not rush me, sonny. you rush a miracle man, you get rotten miracles. you got money?
sixty-five.
sheesh! i never worked for so little, except once, and that was a very noble cause. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           93.
this is noble, sir.  his wife is crippled. his children are on the brink of starvation.
are you a rotten liar.
i need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
your first story was better.  where is that bellows?  he probably owes you money, huh? well, I will ask him.
he is dead. he can not talk.
look who knows so much. well, it just so happens that your friend here is only mostly dead. there is a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. please open his mouth.
now, mostly dead is slightly alive. now, all dead...well, with all dead, there is usually only one thing that you can do.
what is that?
true love. you heard him. you could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
sonny, true love is the greatest thing in the world. except for a nice mlt, a mutton, lettuce and tomato sandwich, where the mutton is nice and lean and the tomato is ripe. they are so perky, i love that. but that is not what he said. he distinctly said "to blave." and, as we all know, "to blave" means "to bluff." so you are probably playing cards, and he cheated
-- get back, witch --
I am not a witch, I am your wife. but after what you just said, I am not even sure i want to be that anymore.
you never had it so good. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           95.
"true love." he said, "true love," max. my god --
do not say another word, valerie.
he is afraid. ever since prince humperdinck fired him, his confidence is shattered.
why did you say that name -- you promised me that you would never say that name --
what, humperdinck? humperdinck. humperdinck. ooo-ooo, humperdinck
I am not listening.
a life expiring and you do not have the decency to say why you will not help --
nobody's hearing nothing!
humperdinck. humperdinck! humperdinck!
humiliations galore!
that is a noble cause. give me the sixty-five, I am on the job.
the chocolate coating makes it go down easier. but you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. and you should not go swimming after, for at least, what?
an hour.
yeah, an hour.
a good hour. yeah.
thank you for everything.
okay. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           97.
bye-bye, boys.
have fun storming the castle.
think it will work?
it would take a miracle. bye!
bye.
inigo -- there is more than thirty --
what is the difference?  we have got him. help me here. we will have to force feed him.
has it been fifteen minutes?
we can not wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
tilt his head back. open his mouth.
how long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
your guess is as good as mine --
I will beat you both apart. I will take you both together.
you have been mostly dead all day.
we had miracle max make a pill to bring you back.
who are you? -- are we enemies? why am i on this wall? -- where is buttercup? --
let me explain --  -- no, there is too much. let me sum up.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           99.
buttercup is marrying humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the princess, make our escape after i kill count rugen.
that does not leave much time for dilly dallying.
and it is guarded by sixty men.
and our assets?
your brains, fezzik's strength, my steel.
where did we put that wheelbarrow the albino had?
over the albino, i think.
well, why did not you list that among our assets in the first place? what i would not give for a holocaust cloak.
there we cannot help you.
will this do?
where did you get that?
at miracle max's. it fit so nice, he said i could keep it.
why? you can not even lift one.
true, but that is hardly common knowledge, is it?  thank you. now, there may be problems once we are inside.
I will say -- how do i find the count? -- once i do, how do i find you again? -- once i find you again, how do we escape? --
do not pester him, he is had a hard day.
right, right, sorry.
inigo.
what?
i hope we win...
you do not seem excited, my little muffin.
should i be?
brides often are, I am told.
i do not marry tonight.
now?
not yet.
now?
light him.
i killed him myself.
then why is there fear behind your eyes?
he is getting away from me, fezzik. please. fezzik!
I will be right back.
oh, westley, darling.  westley, why will not you hold me?
gently.
at a time like this that is all you can think to say? "gently?"
gently!!
hello. my name is inigo montoya. you killed my father. prepare to die.
stop saying that!
no --
-- offer me money --
-- yes --
-- power too -- promise me that --
-- all that i have and more please --
-- offer me everything i ask for --
-- anything you want --
i want my father back, you son- ofa-bitch!
oh, westley, will you ever forgive me?
what hideous sin have you committed lately?
i got married. i did not want to. it all happened so fast.
it never happened.
what?
it never happened. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          117.
but it did. i was there. this old man said, "man and wife."
did you say, "i do"?
well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
then you are not married -- if you did not say it, you did not do it  -- would not you agree, your highness?
a technicality that will shortly be remedied. but first things first. to the death.
no.  to the pain.
i do not think I am quite familiar with that phrase.
I will explain. and I will use small words so that you will be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
that may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me.
-- and then my tongue, i suppose. i killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake i do not mean to duplicate tonight.
i was not finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
-- and then my ears, i understand. let's get on with it
wrong! your ears you keep, and I will tell you why --
where is fezzik?
i thought he was with you.
no.
in that case --
you know, it is very strange -- i have been in the revenge business so long, now that it is over, i do not know what to do with the rest of my life.
have you ever considered piracy? you would make a wonderful dread pirate roberts.
what? what?
no, it is kissing again. you do not want to hear it.
i do not mind so much.
now i think you ought to go to sleep.
okay.
okay. okay. okay. all right. so long. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          124.
maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
as you wish...
