she's ready.
oh, adam, the model looks so good. the historical society will love it.  you've finished the streets?
almost.
manchurian tung oil?  where did you get it?
helen got it for me in oslo.
god... manchurian tung oil? there's enough to refinish the gateleg table <u>and</u> the cherry wardrobe!
yeah, i want to get one coat on the wardrobe and then i'll help you.
oh, honey, i'm so glad we're spending our vacation at home.
god, how i have looked forward to this, honey.
oh no.
it's <u>your</u> turn, darling.
hi, barb!  i'm glad i caught you. i heard you were on vacation!
that's right, jane.  complete vacation.
honey -- today i am three hundred <u>fifty</u> thousand dollars!
no!  jane, it is 6:45 in the morning!
look at me, think of me as cash! this offer is really real!  from a rich man in new york city who only saw a photograph!
jane, don't send photographs of our house around the country! we're not interested in selling.
you could double the size of your hardware store!  you'll be rich.
and live in what, our station wagon?
barbara maitland, sweetie, you just listen now.  this house is too big.  it really ought to be for a couple with a family.
oh, honey... i didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. i know these things.
'bye, jane, i'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
maybe i am three-eighty-five if you carry a second lien!  i can arrange the most creative financing in the six states of new england.
no, jane.
you'll be rich!
we're rich in what really matters.
adam my booyy!  when you're really rich in what matters...  ... nothing matters!  my buyer has just made a killing in condos in the village.  and he's got a little stress problem...  ... so his wife says they want the old peace and quiet!
so do i, jane.  i'm on vacation.
does that mean you'd consider it in two weeks?  you don't have to answer now.  he wants me to check the deed restriction anyway.  you take your vacation, adam.  say 'bye!
get <u>away</u> you little monster.
i will <u>never</u> sell this house. i'll be buried in my yard next to barbara.  holding hands!  and a good paintbrush!
jane said we should sell the house to someone with a family.
ah, the ever-tactful jane.  let's just relax about having children.
we should be flattered that she wants to sell our house.
i know... i just wish she'd leave us alone.
let's not think about it.  we'll have a nice romantic, quiet, vacation.  here comes the bridge chorus.
wave at the lion.
don't forget the balls, ernie.
adam!
adam, your bozman building is a beauty.
yeah it turned out okay.  we applied for a national historical plaque for it.  that'll be the third one on main street.
you're doing it, adam.  you're saving this town.
slow down there, honey... i don't want the vibration to weaken the model.
oh... i'm sorry...
this fire wasn't burning when we left the house.
how's your arm?
i'm not sure.  it feels... frozen.
you'd better sit down, hon.
i am sitting.
i'll tell you what, barbara.  i don't think we survived that crash.
oh, adam.  we're home.  in our own house.  nonsense.  i'll make some coffee.  you get some more firewood.
you saved my -- uh -- life... or whatever... something.
two hours.
what?
that's how long you were gone.
... hmmm?
anything happen while i was away?
yes it did.  yes it did.  i made a couple of small discoveries. here's one.
handbook for the recently diseased.
de<u>ceased</u>.  i don't know where it came from.
look at the publisher.  handbook for the recently deceased press.
i don't think we survived the crash.
this is going to take some time.
i don't like situations like this. i hate it when i'm not in control. so just tell me the basics.
this book isn't arranged that way. what do you want to know?
there are a thousand things... why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  is this a punishment?  are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? and how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
i don't see anything about 'rewards and punishments' or 'heaven and hell.'  this book reads like stereo instructions!  listen to this... 'geographical and temporal perimeters... functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  this is going to take some time.
cabin fever, hon?
i can't clean anything.  the vacuum is out in the garage.  i can't leave the house.  why don't they tell us something?  where are all the other dead people in the world?  why is it just you and me?
maybe this is heaven.
in heaven there wouldn't be dust on the wallpaper.
hon... i didn't want to die, but really, this is fine with me.  as long as i never have to wash dishes again.
dishes?  we haven't eaten in three weeks!  adam, i'm not like you, i really need to be around <u>people</u>, get out to the church and go grocery shopping.
but i'm not hungry, are you?
god, it's jane butterfield!
what's she doing here?
i don't know.  <u>jane, jane, up here</u>!
she can't see you, right?  in the book, rule number two: the living usually won't see the dead.
won't?  or can't?
just says 'won't.'  wait a minute. here it says 'the living are arrogant... they think they'll never die, so they refuse to see the dead.'
arrogant.  that's jane butterfield all right...
at least we won't have to worry about her.
i guess... if i'm going to be dead, i'll just have to be the best dead person ever!
that's my girl!
what do you think, honey?
delia hates it.
it's <u>otho</u>!
otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
it's bad luck.  and i believe hugely in luck.
hold your breath and we'll pull.
that was the single most unattractive window treatment i have ever seen in the entire of my existence.
i'm <u>so</u> glad you could leave the city to consult me, otho.
yes, of course you are.  well, otho had an intuition.  call it a hunch -- that it was going to be a fabled monstrosity of a house.  and it certainly is.  charles, you're lucky the yuppies are buying condos, so you can afford what i'm going to have to do to this place. we are talking <u>from the ground</u> <u>ups'ville</u>!
that's fine, otho.  just keep me out of it.  i am here to relax and clip coupons.  and goddamnit, i mean to do it.
is the rest of the house as bad as this?
the rest of the house is probably worse.  when can you and i get started?
no time like the present, as my wicked stepmother used to say.
otho, that's terrible.
my sentiments exactly.  porcelain is for teeth!
adam, we <u>are</u> in hell.  i hate these people.
they make gypsies look good.
is this a punishment for something we did in life?  what can we do?
i don't know if there's anything we can do.
we're not completely helpless. i've been reading the book. there's a word for people in our predicament, honey.
what's wrong?
i thought i saw something.
okay?
you read my <u>mind</u>!  i love clients who can read my mind.  i don't think people realize how strong a connection there is between interior decoration and the supernatural.
<u>i know</u>... i read your book, <u>the</u> <u>haunted tapestries of the waldorf</u>.
gooood!
what do you think?
viridian?
viridian?  what is...?
blue-green!  hydrated chromic oxide!  remember i'm schooled in chemistry.  i was a hair analyst! briefly.  interior design is a <u>science</u>, delia!  think of me as doctor otho.  and this patient is truly <u>sick</u>!
of course, her favorite color! how <u>beautiful</u>!
<u>oh my god</u>!
<u>i know</u>!  we just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
otho, i can<u>not</u> <u>live</u> with these cheap domestic floor tiles.
be brave!  otho take care!  onward!
is there much more of this torture?
that's charles' study.  but you don't have to even look in there. he'll love whatever you do to it.  he's such a sheep.
oh, as long as we're here...
'i' will tell you what is boring.  once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  what's on the third floor?
attic space.
let's see.  we could turn that into a media room.
you don't have a key?
maybe charles does.
i have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
probably the world's largest <u>reader's</u> <u>digest</u> collection!  c'mon, let's have some chablis, otho, i'm laid bare by this experience.  entirely bare.
oh, honey, we may need that.
no, i'm not putting up with this.
barbara, honey!  don't go out there.  you don't know --
whatever it is it can't be worse than this.
oh, adam, don't ever leave me alone.
<u>you</u> left me.
i know.  i'm sorry.
we're trapped in this house forever... with those... people.
you can't say that for sure.  it could be a transitional thing. like a post-life crisis.  we just have to be tougher with them. come on.  have some brandy. spirits, get it?
death didn't improve your sense of humor.
i can't believe that we're eating cantonese.  is there no szechuan up here?  hunan?
there's only one chinese restaurant in town, darling, the owners are irish and irish people happen to cook cantonese.  they don't know better.
i plan to have a stroke from the amount of msg that's in this food.
this is our first meal in this house, lydia.  why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
lydia, relax.  we'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
my whole life is a darkroom!  one ... big... dark... room.
yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
lydia, we're the first trickle! in a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
we'll be <u>the</u> art center of summer new york.  i'll teach those phony gallery creeps to refuse my sculpture.  and when otho and i get through with this house, you people are not going to recognize it.
i say let's keep it the way it is.
lydia, at your age, you are <u>so</u> <u>young</u>.  charles, we need to call that awful jane butterfield tomorrow and get the key to the attic door.  can't you find a way to hold back some of her commission?
we're going to have a lot to do tomorrow... the goodwill truck is coming, and whatever is up there in that attic goes away with it. should have it fumigated too.  i saw a fly today.
look in the index... maybe there's, like an emergency number or something.
not really...  what's this?
that's it?  no number, or instructions?
nothing.  the bio buster?  i don't get it...
well there's a little deetz at least.  boy, when you city people do something, you do it right, don't you?
what happened to the people who used to live here?
is this the key to the attic?
that's a skeleton key.  it'll open any door in that house.  will you give it to your father?  and you might mention that i single-handedly decorated the house.  in case he needs advice in that area.  come see me.
are we going to be seeing you at miss shannon's boarding school?
yes, but i'm going to live at home.
remind me to talk to your mother about the dress code.  i'm sure you're going to be very happy there.
<u>you jerks</u>!  that is my art, and it is <u>dangerous</u>!  you think i want to die like that?  lydia.  moving is a family affair. so buckle down now and go get mommy some drugs.
any particular kind?
joke!  joke!  aspirin!  it doesn't matter what brand.
that little girl saw us.
she couldn't have.  we can't <u>make</u> them see us.
but she <u>saw</u> us.  i could feel it.
that's all we need.
where is your mother?
stepmother.  she's out torturing the movers.
lydia.  try to be civil.  i'm going to see if i can set up a noise-free zone in the study.
i was just trying to open the door.  mrs. butterfield brought over a skeleton key.
let me have it.
skeleton keys never work.  anyway, this can wait.  we'll get a crowbar later.  your mother...
stepmother.
... asked you for something, didn't she?  i'm going down to relax.  i want a noise-free zone. do you understand?  noise free.
what?
i'm lonely.
there's nothing we can do.  it's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  there goes my model.  there goes our last refuge.
we're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  i can tell you that.  we need help.  i'm going to talk to that little girl.
what about this beetle guy?
we don't know who he is...  ... i'm going to talk to that little girl.
are you crazy?  she can't hear you.
i don't know... what are you looking up?
we need some help.  i found something this morning.  here. emergencies.  'in case of emergency, draw door.'
draw door?  i don't know why we keep looking in that stupid book.
yet another triumph for adam and barbara in the afterlife.
wait.
darling, can't you see i'm relaxing in here!
well i just wanted to tell you what i saw.
lydia.  what the hell is the point of my moving up here if you people won't let me relax?  go help your mother.
... not what i expected when we walked through that door.
no.  but it's somewhere without big worms.
you don't have an appointment, do you?
w... we didn't know how to make one.
nine months?  what difference does that make?
good luck.  you're going to use up all your help vouchers.
help vouchers?
d-90's.  you spend a hundred and twenty-five years on earth, actually, in that house, during which you get only three class- one d-90 intercessions with juno. you probably haven't even read through the manual completely yet.
wait for who?
for juno, your caseworker.  not that it matters to your type.  but there <u>are</u> all these other people here ahead of you.  i'd say three hours.
my god, we're back where we started.
look at this, everything is different down here.  all our furniture is gone.
how long do you suppose we were waiting?
i'd nearly given up on you.  i was about to leave.  i do have other clients.
are you juno, our case worker?
yes.  i evaluate individual cases and determine if help is needed, deserved, and available.
we need help.  we deserve help.
are you available?
no.  what's wrong?
we're very unhappy.
what do you expect?  you're dead.
we'd like some help in getting rid of the people who moved in here.  barbara and i worked very hard on this house.
we probably wouldn't mind sharing the house with people who were --
-- like you used to be?
yes.
hell is other people.  you obviously don't read much. besides things seem pretty quiet here.  you should thank god you didn't die in italy.  the deetzes.  okay.  have you been studying the manual?
we tried.
the intermediate interface chapter on haunting says it all.  get 'em out yourself.  it's your house. haunted houses don't come easy.
i heard.  tore your face right off!  bad news.  it obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
we have to start simpler, is that it?
start simply.  do what you know. use your talents.  practice.  we only help those who help themselves. just do a little at a time.  and of course, practice, practice, practice.  it's tricky but -- you weren't murderers by any chance, were you?
no.
pity.  murderers seem to have an easy time of it.  just look at amityville.  he was one of my boys.  didn't have to give that one any lessons. from day one... but i must be off ... i've got a planeload of football players crashed in the midwest... they need a lot of help, just with the basics.
if... we have trouble.  what about the guy in the flyer?  betelge...
no.  you don't want his help.
no, you don't!  he does not work well with others.
what do you mean?  what's he do?
he's a freelance bio-exorcist. claims to get rid of the living. but he's a troublemaker.  he's pushy.  he's been sleazing around that cemetery for 500 years.
our cemetery?
yeah.  he still tries popping up all over the place.  but he can't join the party unless you call on him.  get the deetzes out by yourselves! i gotta go.
<u>don't say his name</u>!  just practice. do it <u>yourself</u>!
and if we need <u>you</u> again, how do we...?
that guy is in our cemetery.  oh, adam.
look, she's right.  we'll just start simple, honey, be tougher. i feel... confident.  c'mon.
not <u>a building</u>!  that's the beauty of it.  i think i can buy the <u>whole town</u>.  these people don't know the value of their property!
then we own a whole <u>town</u> full of nowhere.
no, no, c'mon, max, you know me. i've got plans.  you gotta come up here and see, then i'll tell you about it.
just a minute, maxie.  somebody...
no listen... we'll talk about this visiting later, i gotta go, i gotta meeting on the japanese joint venture.
great idea, maxie!  those japanese could <u>run</u> it for us.  build them a dormitory in the woods.  listen, think right about it, will you? we've almost got the house ready, you bring sarah with you and i'll show you.
yeah yeah, we'll think on it. 'bye ya, charles.  you relax up there, ya hear?
god, this is so corny.  have we been reduced to this?  sheets?
think of them as death shrouds. and the moaning is important. really <u>moan</u>!  practice, practice, practice.
i feel really stupid.
it's <u>not</u> stupid.  we're ghosts. do you want this woman for breakfast for 125 years?  moan louder!
a... are you the guys who're hiding out in the attic?
we're ghosts.
aren't you scared?
i'm not scared of ralph lauren. those are <u>sheets</u>.  are you gross under there?  are you <u>night of the</u> <u>living dead</u> under there?  like all bloody veins and pus?
what?
<u>night of the living dead</u>?  it's this gross movie.
if i had seen a ghost at your age, i would have been frightened out of my wits.
you're not gross.  why were you wearing a sheet?
we're practicing.
you can actually see us?  without the sheets?
is this like a trick question?
tell the truth.
i always tell the truth.  of course i can see you.
nobody else can.
i'm wearing contacts... also i read through <u>handbook for the</u> <u>recently deceased</u>.  it says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>i am</u> strange and unusual.
why are you creeping around delia's bedroom?
we were trying to scare your mother.
stepmother.  i'm very sensitive about being related to reptiles.
<u>you</u> did this?  you carved all these little figures and houses and things?
i certainly did.  i'd finish it too, but... i don't get out much.
and this used to be your house, i bet.  why do you want to scare everybody?
we want to frighten you away.  so that you'll move out.
you don't know the deetzes very well, do you?  my father bought this place.  he never walks away from equity.  why don't <u>you</u> leave?
we can't.  we haven't left the house since the funeral.
funeral.  god, you guys <u>really are</u> <u>dead</u>!  what was it like?  the funeral. did you cry?
we weren't there.  the handbook says funerals aren't for the dead.
god, if this is true this is like, amazing!  i kinda like it up here. can i visit you sometimes?
well, i don't know... we don't get many visitors.
where are your skulls and bones?
you know you're really a pretty girl.
i don't wear that stuff to <u>bed</u>. besides, there's <u>nothing</u> wrong with it.  i'm getting out of here.
wait... i don't think it would be a very good idea if you told your parents that we're up here.
you tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
wait a minute.  i had some licorice ice cream earlier.  you guys could be gas.  what if... i'm dreaming. can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
dad.  do you believe me?
yes.  except when you creep around in your mother's --
stepmother's...
... sheets.
well this is... i mean, this is the weirdest --
lydia, i don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
<u>this is not a joke</u>!  that sheet was full of ghosts.
i can't believe you are doing this to me!  <u>ghosts</u>.  i am giving a dinner party for seven people tonight.  otho has agreed to come back for the demolition of the attic.  my agent, bernard, is bringing some woman who writes for <u>architectural digest</u>.  in fact, no one here tonight has not been in <u>vanity fair</u>.  except you.
i <u>told</u> them you were too mean to be afraid.
don't you <u>dare</u> talk to others about me.  i'm an <u>artist</u>!  the only thing that scares me is being embarrassed in front of my friends.  do you know how hard it is to get civilized people to set foot in this part of connecticut? not a solitary word of this pubescent tripe to anyone.
lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
she's got <u>photos</u>, barbara.
adam, you had a photo of big foot!
this is different.  eventually she'll take someone to the attic. and then what?  we've got to try to contact this guy betelmyer. we gotta get some help, hon.
did you copy these gravestones right, adam?
of course i did.
then it should be here.
here's something.
i didn't do that one... hmmm.
... yes this must be him.  look... betelgeuse... betelgeuse...
go ahead... third time's a charm.
<u>betelgeuse</u>!
what happened?
three times.  powerful number.
bet... el... geuse.  what an awful name.  i thought it was like -- you know.  the <u>juice</u> of <u>beetles</u>.
has anything been simple so far? from the look of the shovel, we dig.
oh, adam.  i don't have gloves.  my nails keep getting longer.  i'll break them.
i guess we open it.
maybe we should knock first?
all right.  who are you?
we're...
you're the dead.
aren't you dead?
hell no!  i'm rolling.  i'm a businessman.  i'm the man what <u>am</u>. <u>beee</u>tel <u>jooose</u>!  <u>who</u> do i gotta kill?
you don't kill anyone.
just get some people out of our house.
bio-<u>busting</u>.  i <u>loves</u> bio-busting. who do i gotta kill?  family -- right?  obnoxious i bet.  mommie, daddy, piglets.
just one daughter.
hey <u>you've</u> been on saturn!  i <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>yecchhh</u>! i've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  so a daughter?  she got good legs? god i love a young leg.
she's only fourteen...
... acts like she's thirty-five.
<u>so</u> you, the dead, want me, <u>the</u> <u>undead</u>, to throw the live guys -- mommie, daddy and lolita, who might not mind a tumble with an older guy, out into the cold? even though they have paid hard casharoonie for your dump?
but... the deetzes are <u>destroying</u> our house.
you maitlands are the backbone of the afterlife.  so what's my cut?
can you scare them off?
honey.  let's go.
go?  what d'ya mean?  we need help.
no, we don't.  we can work something out ourselves.  we just have to try harder.
folks, be reasonable here.  i'm at your service.  you be the judge. i'm a harmless guy.  try me.
home.  <u>home</u>.  <u>home</u>!
honey, i think that was a mistake.
i am not going to expose that little girl to that... pervert down there.
but <u>we</u> let him out.
i don't care, i've changed my mind.  ... i feel <u>really</u> confident.  we're getting better at this stuff.  we can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  i've got an idea.  you're going to love it... i'm going to hate it.
okay.  but that betelgeuse sure seemed mad.
hi ho, hi ho, it's off to work i go!
otho, you've got to help me get maxie dean up here.  i have a deal that could make all of us very comfortable.
he's a cloven-hooved beast!
he's your cousin.
i am ashamed to say he is.  look, nothing short of giving away free sacks of money would get him up here, charles.  and sarah?  forget it.  you can't get her out of bergdorf's with plastic explosives.
don't you <u>dare</u>.
i saw some ghosts.
lydia tried to play a most amusing joke on me this afternoon.
it wasn't a joke.
tried to convince me that this house is haunted.  kids.  kids. kids!  i love them.
now, lydia... favor us about your ghosts.
<u>no</u>!  do not encourage this little... person.
oh, delia, lighten up!
she's been without therapy up here and i will not allow her to ruin...
and your sushi was remarkable.
the sushi?  i did the wine. didn't you do the sushi?
n... no,  i just did the ink spots.
who did the sushi?
it does indicate a marvelously urbane sense of humor on the part of these ghosts -- that they actually appear in <u>sheets</u>!
we're dealing with tracy and hepburn here, a very sophisticated pair.  we must protect them, treat them with respect, <u>nur</u>ture them.
they don't want to come down.
why not?
i think the reason is they were trying to scare you, and you didn't get scared --
of <u>course</u> we weren't scared.  just a little startled.  one of those sushi dropped down my kamali.
all presences have a home space. a place where they live, so to speak.  where do they hide out?
the attic.
the attic room is locked --
they're ghosts.  they do what they want.
all right, you dead people!  come on out, or we'll break down this door and drag you out on the ropes you hanged yourself with!
shhhh.  they didn't commit suicide.
it doesn't matter.  what matters is i've got a roomful of guests down there, who think i'm a fraud.  i am going to teach you something here lydia.  you've <u>got</u> to take the right tone in things like this, or people -- whether they're dead or alive -- people will walk all <u>over</u> you.  come on out, or i will make death so miserable that you will wish you had never <u>lived</u>!
answer your mother.
listen, you guys.  these ghosts are really nice people.  i think we scared them off.  let's just leave them alone.  okay?
look at that <u>detail</u>!
look at the tiny figures.
look at all that <u>parking</u>!
come on.  leave their stuff alone.
lydia, i will never forgive you for embarrassing me in front of my social inferiors.  you help us with these ghosts or you'll be sorry.
i'm sorry already.
now, let's get back to business. i want to get maxie dean and sarah up here immediately.  i can make history here!  i'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
i cannot believe this.
delia will cook...
i'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  and lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
i can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  they're not here!
otho, could you actually... do something with them?
perhaps if i were properly motivated.
that's slavery and murder.  you don't know these people.  they're just like you and me.  they're nice people!
i hate you!  i can't trust anybody!
no, wait!
maybe they'll leave now.  that snake was a pretty nasty customer.
he might have hurt somebody.
but he didn't.  we've got him where we want him.
i don't like charles deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
hey, i've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  i was out.  every dog has his day. this is my town.  i need a night to howl.
this is <u>my</u> town.
you wish!  i nearly scored with that little blonde.  i need me a short little queen.
<u>adam</u>!  why did you build a whorehouse?  have you ever been to...?
i didn't --
the whorehouse was my idea. i want betelgeuse out of the picture!  we've got some serious talking to do.
about what?
you people have really screwed up!  i received word that you allowed yourselves to be <u>photographed</u>.  and you let betelgeuse out and didn't put him back, and you let otho get ahold of the handbook.
handbook?  when...?
<u>never trust the living</u>!  we <u>cannot</u> have a routine haunting like yours provide incontrovertible visual proof of existence beyond death.
well, we didn't know --
i feel like we've been at war, charles.
at least insofar as we have our first casualty.  me.
otho'll know what to do.
what's he going to do?  viciously rearrange their environment?
otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for max and sarah... because i've bought options on property all over town.  i need max's financing...
just don't tell lydia.
why not?
i think she's in with them.
mr. and mrs. maitland?  i've come for the last time.  where are you?  barb...
they're dead.
cookie, they are dead, dead, deadski.
of course they're dead.  they're ghosts.
no, i mean they've gone. decamped.  split.  vanished.
where'd they go?
the happy hunting ground.  who cares?
are you a spirit too?
sort of.  high spirit.  heh heh. listen, cookie, i've been trapped in this burg for hundreds of years.  all i want is to get out.
i want to get in.
you do?  over here?  on <u>my</u> side?
i think so.
well, yes, of course.  it's great over here.  you'll meet all the greats.  james dean.  buddy holly.  'the little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
that's right.  they treat you like scum i bet?
yeah.
i can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  so <u>simple</u>.  say my name three times. that's all.  i'll be all yours. then i'll bring you over here in style.
i... i don't know what your name is.
minor problem.  the rules.  i can't tell it to you.  but... do you know how to play charades?
yes.
of course you do.
three syllables.
no, dummy.  two.
your fingers are so small i can't see them.  first word -- two syllables.
i don't know what that signal means.
it means look <u>behind</u> you, bimbo.
beetle!
good girrrl!
breakfast beetle?  beetle?  beetle fruit?  fruit bat?  fruit battle? volkswagen?  fruit wagon?
good thing you are beautiful, kid. you are <u>dumb</u>!
i am <u>not</u>!  beetle... juice?
that's it!
your name is <u>beetle juice</u>?  yecch! that's as bad as <u>deee</u>lia <u>deee</u>tz.
it's spelled different, but basically... now you said it twice; just one more time, and i'll be free.  and then <u>you'll</u> be free.
god, you're anatomically correct!
just <u>say</u> it.
you were the snake!  right?  i know.  i saw you.
you've <u>got</u> to say it!
no i don't.  i don't take orders from smurfs.
how'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  right now.  i can do it if i get out.
they'd look silly on me.  i'm fourteen years old!
how'd you like to be married to... the king...?
yes... or no?  do you want the deetzes out or in?
<u>out</u>.
what about betelgeuse?
forget him.  he'll remain with his whores until someone calls him.  you need to worry about people like <u>otho</u>.  there are a lot of phony trance mediums.  they usually can't make the formulas work, but if otho stumbles on the right words in that handbook... he could hurt you.  as in -- <u>exorcism</u>.
you lilly-livered bleeding hearts!
i'm so sorry we frightened you. what were you doing?
he said if i let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
no, lydia, we're dead.
i want to be dead too.
no you don't!  no... lydia... why?
life is just... too awful.
lydia, believe me... we know... all the hard stuff is the same over here.  you're going to be who you are... whether you're alive or dead ... and over here -- it's... it's flat... there's no food, no colors ... you can't smell the flowers.  if we knew then what we know now we'd have been more careful...
... we wouldn't have had our little accident.
so, <u>never</u> let beetle juice out. never.  besides...  we're thinking about letting everyone stay... you and your father and mother can stay too.
step... mother.
what is going on?
really.  i don't know.
they're... not here anymore.
nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
are they still here, otho?
oh, they're still here.  they're just not showing up.
they're probably guilty about what they did to me.
not these people!  they are ruthless!
i don't care from guilt.  i just want to <u>see</u> them.
otho, can you do it?
wait a minute!  what am i worried about?  otho, you can't even change a tire!
i'll need something personal of theirs.
their wedding clothes.
their wedding clothes.
you know, i've been thinking.  i could teach lydia to sew.
little black party dresses?
ah, adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  she's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
let's see if she can get my model back.
you can build another one... with her.
we've been given a gift here, honey.  a real live little girl. she likes us a lot.  she needs us. maybe that's why we died so young, to keep us from getting so... attached to <u>things</u>.  the house, antiques, your model.  look at us. we didn't have room for anyone.
what makes you think she likes me?
<u>adam</u>!  <u>adam</u>!
as flies the lizard serpent fell; as goblin vizard, at the spell of pale wizard, sinks to hell; the buried, dead, and slain... rise again.
what's happening to them?
i don't know.
are they suffering?
they're already dead.  they can't feel a thing.
so... you're ready for me now?
you've got to help them.
can you help <u>me</u>?
... i will.
then <u>i'll</u> help them.  for a price.
w... what is it?

your qu...?  but you're...
i'm beeyoo-teeful.
otho?
it's too late, charles.  i'm sorry.
<u>barbara</u>?!!
now, let's get rolling!
what...?
just a hunch.
hellooo!  how's school?
it's okay.  how's the dirt business?
well, i just placed a call to your mother.  she had stepped out but i have some news for her.
what time is it?
3:30 i guess.
give or take a year.
did you get the paint?
i got it.  and i took pictures of the new church for you, too.
how'd you do on the science test?
it was gross. they wanted me to dissect a frog. i told them no way.  i said it was against my religion.  i got a c.
we studied all day yesterday. don't tell me...
i got an a!
so can i?
uh-uh.  only if you got <u>above</u> a c on science.
oh puh-leeze!
oh, adam, don't tease her.  you never got an a in science in your life!
all right.
