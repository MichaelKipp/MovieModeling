i was just the accountant.
simple engineering, though, wouldn't you think?  change the machines around, whatever you do, you could make other things, couldn't you?
once the war ends, forget it, but for now it's great, you could make a fortune. don't you think?
i think most people right now have other priorities.
get the contracts and i'm sure you'll do very well.  in fact the worse things get the better you'll do.  it was a "pleasure."
the contracts?  that's the easy part. finding the money to buy the company, that's hard.
jews, yeah.  investors.
jews can no longer own businesses, sir, that's why this one's for sale.
well, they wouldn't own it, i'd own it. i'd pay them back in product.  they can trade it on the black market, do whatever they want, everybody's happy.
pots and pans.
something they can hold in their hands.
i don't know anybody who'd be interested in that.
they should be.
what's that?
you don't recognize it?  maybe that's because it's not what i asked for.
you asked for shoe polish.
my buyers sold it to a guy who sold it to the army.  but by the time it got there - because of the cold - it broke, the whole truckload.
so i'm responsible for the weather?
i asked for metal, you gave me glass.
this is not my problem.
look it up.
like this?
there's nothing in the stores.
you have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
nice things cost money.
how many?
i don't know, ten or twelve.  that's a good color.  dark blues, grays.
ghetto police.  i'm a policeman now, can you believe it?
yeah, i can.
what was that about the ss, the rate, the ... ?
the jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the ss, not to the worker. he gets nothing.
but it's less.  it's less than what i would pay a pole.  that's the point i'm trying to make.  poles cost more.
i'd never ask you for money, you know that. i don't even like talking about it - money, favors - i find it very awkward, it makes me very uncomfortable -
no, look.  it's the others.  they're the ones causing these delays.
what others?
whoever.  they're the ones.  they'd appreciate some kind of gesture from me.
that'd be fine.
done.  lets not talk about it anymore, let's have a good time.
you know what, you'd like her.
oskar, please -
what -
i don't have to like her just because you do.  it doesn't work that way.
you would, though.  that's what i'm saying.
it's not a charade, all this?
a charade?  how could it be a charade?
luck.
war.
what?
i feel like an old-fashioned couple. it feels good.
should i stay?
it's a beautiful city.
should i stay?
it's up to you.
how you feeling, all right?
yeah.
what's the matter, everything all right at home?  mila's okay?
she's good.
i could try to read this or i could eat my lunch while it's till hot.  we're doing well?
yes.
better this month than last?
yes.
any reason to think next month will be worse?
the war could end.
what?
there's a machinist outside who'd like to thank you personally for giving him a job.
i want to thank you, sir, for giving me the opportunity to work.
you're welcome, i'm sure you're doing a great job.
the ss beat me up.  they would have killed me, but i'm essential to the war effort, thanks to you.
that's great.
i work hard for you.  i'll continue to work hard for you.
that's great, thanks.
god bless you, sir.
yeah, okay.
you're a good man.
don't ever do that to me again.
do what?
it's got nothing to do with reality, oskar, i know it and you know it, it's a matter of national priority to these guys.  it's got a ritual significance to them, jews shoveling snow.
i lost a day of production.  i lost a worker.  i expect to be compensated.
file a grievance with the economic office, it's your right.
would it do any good?
no.
a one-armed machinist, oskar?
he was a metal press operator, quite skilled.
you try to be fair to people, they walk out the door;  i've never understood that.  what's next?
christmas presents.
ah, yes.
he's essential.  without him, everything comes to a grinding halt.  if that happens -
itzhak stern?  he's on the list.
he is.
well, let's find him.
he's on the list.  if he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. he's on the list.  you can't have him.
i'm talking to a clerk.
what's your name?
sir, the list is correct.
i didn't ask you about the list, i asked you your name.
klaus tauber.
the gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
my plant manager is somewhere on this train. if it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the armaments board will want to know why.
we started without you.
good.
you know, they told me you were going to be trouble - czurda and scherner.
you're kidding.
he looks great, though, doesn't he? i have to know - where do you get a suit like that?  what is that, silk?  it's great.
i'd say i'd get you one but the guy who made it, he's probably dead, i don't know.
i go to work the other day, there's nobody there.  nobody tells me about this, i have to find out, i have to go in, everybody's gone -
they're not gone, they're here.
they're mine!
every day that goes by, i'm losing money. every worker that is shot, costs me money - i have to get somebody else, i have to train them -
we're going to be making so much money, none of this is going to matter -
it's bad business.
some of the boys went crazy, what're you going to do?  you're right, it's bad business, but it's over with, it's done.  occasionally, sure, okay, you got to make an example.  but that's good business.
scherner told me something else about you.
yeah, what's that?
that you know the meaning of the word gratitude.  that it's not some vague thing with you like with some guys.
true.
do you have any idea what's involved? the paperwork alone?  forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  then the engineers show up.  they stand around and they argue about drainage - i'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, i've been through it, i know.
well, you've been through it.  you know. you could make things easier for me.
it's true.  never happen in cracow, though, we all love you too much.
i pay you too much.
you held back stern.  you held back the one man most important to my business.
he's important to my business.
what do you want for him, i'll give it to you.
i want him.  come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
this, i don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
thank you.
i got to go, i'll see you.
oskar -
you think i don't know what you're doing? you're so quiet all the time?  i know.
are you losing money?
no, i'm not losing money, that's not the point.
what other point is -
it's dangerous.  it's dangerous, to me, personally.
you have to understand, goeth's under enormous pressure.  you have to think of it in his situation.  he's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about.  and he's got the war. which brings out the worst in people.  never the good, always the bad.  always the bad. but in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this.  he'd be all right.  there'd be just the good aspects of him.  which is a wonderful crook.  a guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
and killing.
i'll admit it's a weakness.  i don't think he enjoys it.  all right, he does enjoy it, so what? what do you expect me to do about it?
there's nothing you can do.  i'm not asking you to do anything.  you came into my office.
i'll talk to him.
i think it's too late.
well, i'll talk to somebody.  i'll take care of it.
what's he done that's so bad - take money? that's a crime?  come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  we're here to make money, all of us.
there's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  he's taking money.
the place produces nothing.  i shouldn't say that - nothing it produces reaches the army.  that's not all right.
so i'll talk to him about it.
he's a friend of yours, you want to help him out. tell me this, though - has he ever once shown you his appreciation?  i've yet to see it. never a courtesy.  never a thank you note.  he forgets my wife at christmas time -
he's got no style, we all know that. so, we should hang him for it?
he's stealing from you, oskar.
of course he's stealing from me, we're in business together.  what is this?  i'm sitting here, suddenly everybody's talking like this is something bad.  we take from each other, we take from the army, everybody uses everybody, it works out, everybody's happy.
he doesn't deserve your loyalty.  more important, he's not worth you making threats against us.
did i threaten anybody here?  i stated a simple fact.
i tried to call you, i'm running a little late, this is taking longer than i thought.  have a drink.
what's going on?
i got a shipment of hungarians coming in, i got to make room for them.  it's always something.
you took my workers.
they're taking mine.  when i said they didn't have a future i didn't mean tomorrow.  auschwitz.
when?
i don't know.  soon.
oskar - my friend lena.
how do you do?  what can i get you, what're you drinking?
nothing's changed.  then again, something has changed, hasn't it?
things worked out.  i made some money over there, had some laughs, you know. it was good.
now you're back.
now i'm back, and you know what i'm going to do now?  i'm going to have a good time.  so are you.
you want these people.
these people, my people, i want my people.
what are you, moses?  what is this? where's the money in this?  what's the scam?
it's good business.
oh, this is "good business" in your opinion. you've got to move them, the equipment, everything to czechoslovakia - it doesn't make any sense.
look -
you're not telling me something.
it's good for me - i know them, i'm familiar with them.  it's good for you - you'll be compensated.  it's good for the army.  you know what i'm going to make?  artillery shells.  tank shells. they need that.  everybody's happy.
yeah, sure.
if you admit to making three, then it's four, actually.  but how?
i just told you.
you did, but you didn't.
yeah, all right, don't tell me, i'll go along with it, it's just irritating to me i can't figure it out.
all you have to do is tell me what it's worth to you.  what's a person worth to you.
four hundred, four fifty -
more.
eight hundred, give or take.
give or take what, stern - how many - count them.
hey, poldek, how's it going?  you know about the list?  you're on it.
of course i'm on it.
you want to stay on it?  what do you got for me?
what do i got for you?
takes diamonds to stay on this list.
your friend amon goeth has been arrested.
i'm sorry to hear that.
there are some things that are unclear. we need to talk.
i'd love to, it'll have to wait until i get back.  i have to leave.
all right, okay, let's talk.
in breslau.
breslau?  i can't go to breslau.  not now.
that's very generous of you.
yes.
what's wrong with it?
how should i know?  it's broken. see what you can do.
we need to talk.
stern.
they arrived.
they arrived, can you believe it?
well, that's to be expected.  they have to understand.  these are start-up problems. this isn't pots and pans, this is a precise business.  i'll write them a letter.
they're withholding payment.
well, sure.  so would i.  so would you. i wouldn't worry about it.  we'll get it right one of these days.
there's a rumor you've been going around miscalibrating the machines.  i don't think that's a good idea.
no?
i know what you're saying, but i don't see the difference.
you don't?  i do.  i see a difference.
you'll lose money.
oskar, good of you to come.
are you kidding, i never miss a party. police chief rasch, my wife emilie.
how do you do?
thank you.
i need a drink.
oh, god, you don't have a drink?
wine?
one of these days the russians are going to show up unannounced at my gate.  i'd like the chance to defend myself.  i'd like my wife to have that chance.  my civilian engineers. my secretary.
we're losing the war, aren't we.
it kind of looks that way.
pistols?
pistols, rifles, carbines ...  i'd be grateful.
i'll talk to you later.
no, no, what, what is it?
where are the guards?
the guards aren't allowed on the factory floor. they make my workers nervous.
i could've got more ... if i'd just ... i don't know, if i'd just ... i could've got more...
oskar, there are twelve hundred people who are alive because of you.  look at them.
if i'd made more money ...i threw away so much money, you have no idea. if i'd just ...
there will be generations because of what you did.
i didn't do enough.
you did so much.
good.  how's it going?
things are great, things are great.
what are you doing?
i'm having a drink, come on in, we'll have a drink.
i mean where have you been? nobody's seen you around for a while.
i've been here.  i guess i haven't been out.
i thought maybe you'd like to come over, have some dinner, some of the people are coming over.
yeah?  yeah, that'd be nice, let me get my coat.
