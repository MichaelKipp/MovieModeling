oooh, yeah.  oh, baby, you're so good.
yeah, i'm the best, baby.
give it to me!  yes!
oh yeah, baby, i'll give it to you.
don't you love my sexy body?!
i do, baby, i do.
you're so big!
yeah, that's right.
fuck me!  yes!
uh...
what the heck is this?
nothing!
it's a big, thick envelope, vicky. you got in.
you think so?
"dear ms. hughes.  we're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected.  enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."
kevin, this is serious!
you got in.
illegal channels?  shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. lifetime supply of pantyhose, or some shit.
yeah -- hey, did you see the little mermaid on tv the other night?  that ariel, whew.
she's a mermaid, dude.
yeah, oz, but not when she's on land.
she's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
a <u>hot</u> cartoon.
is there anything you don't jerk off to?
c-span?
then she said -- she loves me.
oh shit dude, the l-word!
and you said...
nothing, i just hugged her back.
you think she was serious?
i couldn't tell -- she could've meant like, "i love you grandma" or "i love you vanderbilt."
you guys got the latin homework?
no -- kevin, you?
vanderbilt's not that far from u of m.
yeah right.
what?  we both have cars.
yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and kevin haven't even done it yet.
that's not why we're going out.
what the hell are you expecting him to drive to vanderbilt for?  milk and cookies?
jessica!  he'll drive there for me, and i'll drive to ann arbor for him. we're going to have sex when he's ready and i'm ready.  it's got to be completely perfect.  i want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  so did you do the physics write-up?
please.
there's our man.
finch, you got the latin homework?
nova!!
stifler!!
you coming to party tonight, ostreicher, ya fuckface?
depends if my date wants to stop by.
that junior chick?
nah, gave her the heisman.  i'm working on something new.
yeah right.  i got an idea for something new.  how 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
bullshit.  from where?
she works part-time at my dad's store.
hah!  yeah, oz, i bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
dude, he does not.
stifler, you're such an asshole.
meyers, what's the deal with you and vicky, anyway?  you've been going out since homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  shit, i'd drop her like a steaming turd.
you called me to ask me how to get laid?
what was i gonna do, call dad?  i don't even know his number.
just dial 976-asshole.
yeah, well anyway...i thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  i mean, i think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
have you ever heard of the bible?
what?  not <u>the</u> bible?
well, that's not really the name, but we always called it that.
does it tell me how to get laid?
you know what, nevermind.  you're not ready.
ready for what?
whoop, you're fading out.  good luck at that party.
you ever hear of something called the bible?
once, in church, dude.
ooh, here's an easy one:  "attractive swf, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." okay..."attractive"...ugly.
"fun loving" -- insane.
unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
no, "charming" is old.  "older" is <u>really</u> old.  "youthful mind" is dead.
perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  eat your damn imitation hot dog.
this is no imitation.  removing the hot dog from the ultradog yields a better dog.  behold -- ultradog, no dog.
alright...i'm shooting for a nine o'clock eta.  beer in hand by five after.
you can crash at stifler's?
it's all good.  breath check.
dude, i wish you wouldn't do that.
you got something up your sleeve for tonight, finch?
and little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if i needed i ri-hide --
how the hell do you know all these random songs?
it's early springsteen, dude, this is classic.  this was before the cheesy remake.
this was remade?  into what?
bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
at least now i know what the hell they're saying.
so, does my hair look better --  like this, or...  like this?
who cares?
nadia does, that czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. now, do you think she'd prefer --  cool hip jim...  or laid back jim?
what about you?  you're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
you know, i've never got that shit. what exactly constitutes third base?
contact, dude.
then where does a blowjob figure in?
shortstop.  'course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
so let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
feels like warm apple pie, dude.
apple pie...  mcdonald's or homemade?
what's up, fellas?
hey sherman.  scopin' the babes.
indeed.  some fine ladies here, boys. confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. sherman is moving to defcon two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
you've got something going?
did you see that central chick? brunette?
gotta go.
but --
yes.
i thought so.
no...you...go...ahead.
okay.
oh, kev.
vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
tonight?
yeah, it's such a perfect evening. isn't this how you've always pictured it?
great evening, isn't it?
sure.
there's something about the spring that's just cool.  like the smell of fresh rain or something.
what did you just say?
suck me...beautiful?
uh...you know, my friends call me nova -- as in casanova.
you need some work, buddy!
look, chris.  there are just some things you need to learn, that's all.
like what?
alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  you don't need to go to lookout point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
...okay...
you have to pay attention to a girl. be sensitive to her feelings. relationships are reciprocal.
i'm not good in math.
you actually said that?!  haaaah!!
shut the fuck up.
hey, you did better than i did, nova.
oh that's really reassuring.  and don't call me nova anymore.  i'm a fraud.
let me know.
okay, don't stop.
suck me, beautiful!
god dammit, stifler!
check-out time!  please vacate the room.
god, i can't believe there are so many cool people at this party.
yep.
here, babe.
thanks.
really?
uh huh.
i don't know if i want to be doing this.
doing what?
you know.  if we hook up, tomorrow i'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
no way.
he likes it.
of course he does.  what about you? have you just never had one with kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
i think i've had one.
well that's a no.  no wonder you're not psyched about sex.  you've never even had one manually?
...i've never tried it.
are you kidding?  you've never double- clicked your mouse?
jessica, can you drive me home?
sure.
vicky, wait.
not for you.
ow, what the hell?
sorry, i thought you were dead.
good morning gentleman.
finch!  where were you last night? what happened to the foolproof plan?
i thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance.  when i got here, the bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.
feeling better, oz?
i'm such a loser.
that's the spirit.
you did it.
fellas, say goodbye to chuck sherman, the boy.  i am now a man.
i put in months of quality time with vicky.  sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  this is just wrong.
no shit, i'm never gonna get laid. how the hell am i gonna become this mr. sensitive man?
like a bet?
no, a <u>pact</u>.  no money involved.  this is more important than any bet.  now here's the deal: we all get laid before we graduate.
dude, it's not like i haven't been trying to get laid.
this is different.  this is better. think of when you're working out, oz. you need a partner, someone to spot you.  someone to keep you motivated.
that's what we are, we keep each other on track.  prior to this day, we've postured.  we've procrastinated. we've pretended.  we've -- well i can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
pontificated.
separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  but together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
the sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  now think about it --
so, i'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
dude, prom sucks.
i know, but think about it -- at the parties that night.  chicks are gonna want to do it.
yeah, it's like tradition or something.
right.  that gives us...
exactly three weeks to the day.
can i come in?
yeah, sure.
you're not...busy?
dad, come in.
okay.
these are for you.  from father to son.
i know, dad.
oh, okay.  here's let me show you.
dad!  i know!
do you know about the clitoris?
yes dad.
sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
thank you, dad, i got it.
okay, well that about covers it.
ah, you'll get her back soon enough. that's easy, she likes you.  what you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  you gotta give her what she's never had.
what?
i'll give you a hint.  "ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  comprende?
you mean...and orgasm?
you got it, stud.
well...i'm pretty sure i've --
no you haven't.
but that one time --
no.
well of course i'd want to give her that.  i mean, what do you think, i don't care about her?
do you?
of course.
do you love her?
i -- i don't know, you can't ask me that.
well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  that's how i was duped.
i don't want to dupe her, jessica.  if i say it, i have to be sure i mean it.
well it's up to you.  the big l, or the big o.
hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
yeah, i think you sounded pretty good.
i think you need your balls reattached.
keep it down, dude.
what the fuck are you doing here?
this place is an untapped resource. check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are <u>hot</u>.
you dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
dude, watch me work.  they go for sensitive studs like me.
this is your plan, finch?
yep.
this.  right now.
uh-huh.
you're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
mochaccino.  actually, in the spirit of the pact, i do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
of course, finch.  what?
whatever you hear about me, you agree.
what are we gonna hear?
you'll see.  gotta go.  sixteen minute round trip.
finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
when was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
i have no idea.  finch showers in a bathing suit.
no -- it's true.  he is...really... big.
yeah, enormous.
say that again, kevin?
uh...i thought you might know a trick or something.  to make her, you know...
try the spicy tuna hand roll.
what?!  how do i do that?
uh -- forget that.  look, is that all you're interested in?  ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
well, no.  i think...i guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  i mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as i do.
that's good, that's what i needed to hear.  now you qualify.
qualify for what?
you've just inherited the bible.
jim?
it's not what it looks like!
what the hell was that?
sorry.
no, it was good.
oh, well...  it came from the heart.
well then keep it coming.  alright, people, good work!  keep it up and we'll do great at the state competition.
not bad, chris.
really?  hey, thanks -- heather, right?
yeah...so...you've got this sort of... bobby mcferrin thing going there.
yeah.  right, uh-huh.  i feel like i've discovered this whole new side of me.  music is so expressive.
okay.  i mean, i agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?
oh sure.  i know what people think. it's like, oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- i also play football, by the way -- but that's like...not <u>all</u> that i am.
of course, i didn't --
i mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
you?  you think i don't get that? god, it's like just because i don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
yeah...so like, what else <u>do</u> you do?
well the same things you do.  hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  what do you think i do?
i just -- realized that i didn't know anything about you.  i was interested.
oh...well that's okay.  cool.
i was being selfish.  and majorly insensitive.  and i'm a total idiot.
i think "shithead" really says it.
yes!  i'm a shithead!  i'm a complete and total shithead!
and i want to try to make it up to you.
how?
oh...ungghhhhh!
shhhh.  your parents are downstairs.
oh kevin -- don't stop!
just a second!
dad, please stop.  please.  i'm sure i know what you're talking about.
sure you know, son, but i think you've been having a little problem with it. it's okay, though.  what you're doing is perfectly normal.  it's like practice.  like when you play tennis against a wall.  some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  you do want a partner, don't you son?
yes.
that's great.  now remember, it's <u>okay</u> to play with yourself.  or, as i always called it --  "stroke the salami!"  ho-ho, jim.  there's nothing to be ashamed of.  hell, i'm fifty-two, and i still enjoy masturbating.  uncle mort masturbates.  we <u>all</u> masturbate.
good work, ostreicher.
thanks coach.
you're a killer, ozzy!
-- thanks, coach --
hey, what're you doing here?
just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  you like, "kicked butt."
um...chris --
you can call me oz.
do i have to?
you can call me ostreicher.
what's your middle name?
forget it.
come on!  i won't tell.
neither will i.
okay.  so i had this...thought, and...this may seem like it's out of left field, and i don't know if you can, but since i'm not going with anyone --
<u>yeah</u>!
well, just don't expect oz to pay for the limo.
stifler, fuck --  ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
alright, cool.  i gotta hit the showers, but...i think this'll be really good.
yeah, me too, okay, cool.
hey, you know, what can i say, i dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
i'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
so does your tongue cramp up?
nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
hey, where's finch?
went home to shit.
i don't get it.  how does a guy like that get this sudden reputation?
what reputation?
observe.
okay, explain.
i can't, i have no idea how he's doing it.  and that leaves you trailing, jim.  you gotta get your act together.
you are very good in the world history class, yes?
me?
yes.  no.  yes.
perhaps you can help me with my studies?
okay...that would be cool sometime.  how 'bout tomorrow?
well, i do have ballet practice. perhaps i can come by your house afterwards.  i can change clothes at your place?
i suppose that would be okay.
nice car.
i'm glad you think so.
you don't like it?
no, i like the car.  by the way, though, about prom?  that was like a bad idea.  sorry i invited you.
what?!
oh, please.  i asked you because i thought you might actually be worth going with.  but you are just a jock. no wait.  you're a jerk.
what?  no i'm not.
i saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
i wasn't making fun of you.
give me a break, you're so full of it.
i'll do it.
okay then.  the rest of you okay with that?
why are you doing this?
because i want to.
yeah?  well you can't fake your way through this.  you better practice.
you can do that?
oh -- no way.  i can't do that to her.
you can send me the address too.
well...dammit, if i'm doing this, how the hell am i gonna watch?
i'll save you a seat.
son.  this lady's here for you.
i know.  hey nadia.
dad.
oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. he's a good little kid.  er, guy. man.
dad!!
okay, okay.  i'll let you hit those books.
so you need to change, right?
do you mind?  this fabric is so uncomfortable.
did i miss anything?!
just in time.
you know, jim...you could go back there...and...
seduce her.
but, but -- what would i do?
anything!  just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
that's stupid.
no, you're stupid.  get going!  right now!  she's primed!
oh...oh...oh, shit!
oh boy oh god oh crap oh no.
come on, jim.  where are you?
please, god.  let this be it.
he's going in!
james!  you have come in here on purpose?!
well...uh...
shame on you!
uh...yeah...sorry.
well.  you have seen me.  now it is my turn to see you.  strip.
strip?
yes, slowly.
you mean like, <u>strip</u> strip?
for me?
what do you suppose they're saying?
no idea.
uh...
move with the music.
um...okay...
no, no, you must put your whole body into it.
nadia, i can't --
can't what?  do you not want to be with me?  i wish to be entertained, james.
ho-lee shit.
this just got a hell of a lot better.
jim...
oh no.
you are done, james.  perhaps i should be going now.
no, no, i'm not done!  i've got reserves!  nadia, please please please.  i'm begging you.
did you see this?  this is your more exotic dirty magazine.
yes...james, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
oh yes.  very arousing women.  they arouse me very much.  but not as arousing as you.
holy shit.
holy shit!
no, not again.
i am sorry, jim.  i suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
no!  i've got...reserve reserves!
hey, minuteman.
shut up.  you're supposed to be supportive.
you've still got a chance with nadia, right?
no.  her sponsors here saw the thing on the net.  i don't think they liked it.
how do you know that?
she's already on a plane back home.
yeah?  well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good.
jesus, kevin, rub it in.
hold on.  you have no idea why i'm angry?
is it because we have a test tomorrow? sometimes i get cranky when i know i have a big test to study for.
yeah, that's pretty much it.
i thought so.  because, one time?  i was at this --
what was your name again?
michelle.
okay.  michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
really?  you seriously want to go with me?
yes.  seriously.
are we going to steve stifler's party afterwards?  that would be so cool.
whatever you want.
cool!  we're gonna have so much fun! it's like this one time, at band camp...
you're not doing the extra credit problems.
no, i'm not.  i'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like i'm doing the extra credit problems.  mr. bender doesn't bother to check homework past april.
that's my trick!
it's everyone's trick, kevin.  but i did pick it up from you.
we've come a long way since homecoming.
yeah, we have.  you corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
indeed i did.  but, our relationship. it's progressed a lot.  it's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.
like how?
well, i feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. when two people share...a special moment between them.
i think you're so right, kevin.
you want to do it?
yes --
kevin?  do you not love me?
no, i don't not love you.  i like, i know that we've definitely got <u>something</u> between us.  something good. something special.
but you don't love me.
i didn't say that.  i mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. people say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  it's like they call it off, going "i was wrong."
kevin...you're not your dad.  the two of us, we're not your parents.
i know, vick.  i'm just not ready yet, okay?
okay.
hi...
how did you know i was here?
stifler told me.
you talked to stifler?
well...i needed to find you.  we are gonna have to practice that song.
...okay.  cool then.  i'm um, i'm glad you came by.  i mean, really.
uh...my dad's the manager.
really?  cool.  tell him his subs are great.
ah, he's always too heavy on the vinegar.  if you really want a good one, you gotta let me make it.
my dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and i fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
that's nice.
so you're going to michigan?
yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to northwestern.  i didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- i mean, how am i supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  so when my u of m acceptance came in december, i said the hell with it.
onions?
what?
you want onions?
oh, yeah.  so what're you gonna major in?
well, state's got a good business school.  and i can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  green peppers?
yeah.  so wow, you've got it figured out.
well, i mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am i gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  i really have no idea.
oh thank god, i thought i was the only one.
well, you're not.  oil and vinegar?
yeah.  you know, people are always like, "what're you gonna major in?" and i don't know.  and they're like, "you'll figure it out."  yeah?  when?
i know.  salt and pepper?
sure.
so we're gonna be close next year?
you -- oh, you mean -- yeah, east lansing and ann arbor.
...yeah.
no comment.
no comment?!  are you kidding me?! i've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
thanks.  it was my idea.
did you guys hook up or something?
are you kidding?  no.
then what the hell are you talking about?
well...i guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  that reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  finch comes to me and says, "jessica, i need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  so i told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and i'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  so he did, and i did.
i don't get it, that really works?
duh.  of course.  naturally, i embellished a little bit.  hey, did you hear that finch had sex with an older woman?
oh my fucking god.  you're gay.
come on, you know the words, sing along.
no thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  if you try that at msu this saturday, i'm pretending i don't know you.
our last game is this saturday.
no shit.
...i've got this lacrosse game.  it's really important, it's our last game. and you know, central almost beat us last time, so i really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at state, which means that after the game i might be able to stop by...
you can't sing at the competition.
i'm sorry, i totally spaced.  i just...i didn't realize it...
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
alright...yeah...thanks for understanding.  so i guess...i'll see you later.
kevin!  you seen shitbreak lately?
oh no, stifler, what did you do?
me?  nothing.  i'm the one whose ass he kicked.  i'll tell you one thing, though.  i don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.
finch!  get to the bathroom!  now!
easy, tiger.  what's in there?
just go!
why is this?
you're gonna shit your pants!
charming.
finch, listen -- stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your mocash-chino or whatever.  it's fast acting.  i mean <u>really</u> fast.
first of all, it's <u>mocha</u>ccino, and secondly...oohhhh!
christ!  i didn't say you were out of the game!
sorry, coach.
what the fuck is this?  you got someplace more important to be?
what about the game?!
i'm not playing.
you're missing the game for us?!
no.  i'm missing the game for you.
yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
you fuckin' rule!
hey...
did you know that it's...450 miles from ann arbor to nashville?
it's like a six or seven hour drive. that's easy, i don't mind driving.
about the other day...i've been thinking.
so have i.  and i know you want to make things perfect for me.  and i understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
and i want to make things perfect for you.  you're right, kev, we do have something good...and special.
yeah, we have something great, vick.
kevin...  i want to have sex with you.
now?!
no...i know the perfect time...
you know, at band camp?  we have dances like this.  only they're way funner.  don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
highly, highly overrated.
alright, how do you guys stand?  well, finch, i know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse.  jim?
my date's a flute-toting band dork. that answer your question?
oz, how about you and heather?  now you guys are a couple or something?
dammit, kevin, what's with the attitude?
attitude?  me?  i think that <u>you</u> guys should be more enthusiastic.  shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for.  we're in this together. don't back out on me now!
back out?  you don't need <u>us</u> to get laid.  you afraid or something?
no, but come on guys, we made a pact!
kevin, it was just a --
<u>it was a pact</u>.  you break it and there are no excuses.  you guys have to --
...guess what?
i don't care.
kevin, come on, the bus to stifler's is gonna be here soon.
i'm not going.
i still think you're okay.
so do i, kev.
me too.  for the most part.
nah.  fuck, you guys are right, i don't know what i'm doing.  i mean i'm acting like i've got it all together tonight.  but i know vicky is gonna ask me if i love her.  and i don't know what i'm gonna say.  so now it's like, maybe i'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
and by the way, sherman didn't even get laid.
he didn't?
there it is.  i want to grab my bag. oh, and my date.
come on, kevin.  vicky's looking for you.
stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
it reminds me of this one time --  hey, can i ask you a question?  how come you don't have any stories?  i've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
oh, i've got stories, believe me. they're a little more risque than tales of band camp.
are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  tell me.
okay.  you want a story?  here's a story.  stifler finds this beer, right?  and...
see -- this is the nicest room.
wow, kev...it's perfect.
there's something i've been meaning to tell you, heather.
what's that?
it's gonna sound really bad, but i want you to know.
this isn't the best way to proposition me.
no, that's not what i mean.  i mean -- look.  you know what made me leave that game?  coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
this isn't any better, chris.
no, see heather, what i realized is that...with you, it's not like i'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  and this may sound corny, but --
oz, it's okay, i know.
you called me oz.
well, that's what your friends call you.  i mean...i feel like i'm one of your friends now...and also...your girlfriend.
hmm.  you know that's  really a shitty middle name!
i know, it sucks!
ah, stifler's mom!  thank you for letting us have a great party.
as if there were any alternative in the matter.  are you enjoying yourself?
i'm three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
i'm so happy for you.  takes the edge off, doesn't it?  and where might your date be?
oh no, no date.  bathroom incident.
pardon me?
...nevermind.  you have anything to drink?
i believe the kegs are upstairs.
no, no, that's what the cretins drink. i mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff.
all right, i got some scotch.
single malt?
aged eighteen years.  why don't you get the glasses.  behind the bar.
that is a <u>nasty</u> story!
i told you.
you wanna hear a nasty story of mine? it's kind of sexual.
yeah, bring it on!
well, this one time?  at band camp? we were playing this game, i don't know if you know it?  but it's called spin the bottle?  and i had to kiss this guy named marc wander on the lips?  and...
you comfortable?
yeah, are you?
yeah.
you sure you're comfortable?
yeah.  are you sure?
yeah.
me too.
okay.  did you bring a condom?
yeah, right here.
so, do you want to be -- i mean, how do you want to do it?
i don't know.  how do you?
like, normal style.  the...missionary position.
okay.
yeah vick?
i want to hear you say it.
okay.
victoria...i love you.
i love you.
i can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
then don't.
so, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
yes!  and he was such a dork!  and everyone laughed at me, but i didn't care?  because it was so funny!
okay, i get it.
oh!  and then this one time?  at band camp?  i stuck a flute in my pussy.
...excuse me?!
what, you think i don't know how to get myself off?  hell, that's what half of band camp is!  sex ed!
this'll do.
now, i have two rubbers.  wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  i don't want you coming so damn early.
why, uh, what makes you think that i --
come on.  i saw you on the net.  why do you think i accepted this date? you're a sure thing!
so...would you object if i said you're quite striking?
mister finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
yes ma'am, i am.
i had no idea you'd be this good!
neither did i!
are you gonna do what i think you're gonna do?
don't you want me to?
oh yeah!  put it in your mouth!
okay!
that was a great night.
yeah.
i can't believe we just had our senior prom.
yeah, the time went by so fast.
it did.
kevin, next year...with you in ann arbor, and me in nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
don't say that, we can do it somehow. it might not be perfect, but --
no, kevin --  that's the whole thing, that's what i've been realizing.  that nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything.
vicky...last night...i wasn't lying.
i know.  let's go.  don't you have something to tell your friends?
what?
your little pact.  jessica told me all about it.  way to go, kev!
i guess we'll call you two-ply.
yeah.  so you want double condiments on that?
no, no that's fine.  so you doing okay?
yeah.
i'll tell you, i've learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  of course, i have no frame of reference for this comparison.
so oz, you almost made it, huh?
i'll just say that we had a great night together.
hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
i know.
wow.  you two really have something going, don't you?
i think we're falling in love.
it's true.  i mean, after this, everything'll be different.
after getting laid?
after high school.
yeah, but we'll still see each other.
fuck yeah we will.
hey.  i got another question for you.
what's that?
