oooh, yeah.  oh, baby, you are so good.
yeah, I am the best, baby.
give it to me!  yes!
oh yeah, baby, I will give it to you.
do not you love my sexy body?!
i do, baby, i do.
you are so big!
yeah, that is right.
fuck me!  yes!
uh...
what the heck is this?
nothing!
it is a big, thick envelope, vicky. you got in.
you think so?
"dear ms. hughes.  we are sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we have decided you are now rejected.  enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."
kevin, this is serious!
you got in.
illegal channels?  shit, if there is any channel that should be illegal, it is whatever that women's channel is. lifetime supply of pantyhose, or some shit.
yeah -- hey, did you see the little mermaid on tv the other night?  that ariel, whew.
she is a mermaid, dude.
yeah, oz, but not when she is on land.
she is a cartoon, dude.
a hot cartoon.
is there anything you do not jerk off to?
c-span?
then she said -- she loves me.
oh shit dude, the l-word!
and you said...
nothing, i just hugged her back.
you think she was serious?
i could not tell -- she could have meant like, "i love you grandma" or "i love you vanderbilt."
you guys got the latin homework?
no -- kevin, you?
vanderbilt's not that far from u of m.
yeah right.
what?  we both have cars.
yeah but, no offense, you are talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and kevin have not even done it yet.
that is not why we are going out.
what the hell are you expecting him to drive to vanderbilt for?  milk and cookies?
jessica!  he will drive there for me, and I will drive to ann arbor for him. we are going to have sex when he is ready and I am ready.  it is got to be completely perfect.  i want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
vicky, it is not a space shuttle launch, it is sex.  so did you do the physics write-up?
please.
there is our man.
finch, you got the latin homework?
nova!!
stifler!!
you coming to party tonight, ostreicher, ya fuckface?
depends if my date wants to stop by.
that junior chick?
nah, gave her the heisman.  I am working on something new.
yeah right.  i got an idea for something new.  how 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
dude, it is got to happen -- she is a college chick!
bullshit.  from where?
she works part-time at my dad's store.
hah!  yeah, oz, i bet it is more like your dad works at her store.
dude, he does not.
stifler, you are such an asshole.
meyers, what is the deal with you and vicky, anyway?  you have been going out since homecoming and all she will do is blow you?  shit, I would drop her like a steaming turd.
you called me to ask me how to get laid?
what was i going to do, call dad?  i do not even know his number.
just dial 976-asshole.
yeah, well anyway...i thought you might have some advice, brother to brother.  i mean, i think tonight she might, we might really, there is a chance that -- you know.
have you ever heard of the bible?
what?  not the bible?
well, that is not really the name, but we always called it that.
does it tell me how to get laid?
you know what, nevermind.  you are not ready.
ready for what?
whoop, you are fading out.  good luck at that party.
you ever hear of something called the bible?
once, in church, dude.
ooh, here's an easy one:  "attractive swf, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." okay..."attractive"...ugly.
"fun loving" -- insane.
unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
no, "charming" is old.  "older" is really old.  "youthful mind" is dead.
perhaps you should consider actually answering an ad.
finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick.  eat your damn imitation hot dog.
this is no imitation.  removing the hot dog from the ultradog yields a better dog.  behold -- ultradog, no dog.
alright...i'm shooting for a nine of the clock eta.  beer in hand by five after.
you can crash at stifler's?
it is all good.  breath check.
dude, i wish you would not do that.
you got something up your sleeve for tonight, finch?
and little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if i needed i ri-hide --
how the hell do you know all these random songs?
it is early springsteen, dude, this is classic.  this was before the cheesy remake.
this was remade?  into what?
bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
at least now i know what the hell they are saying.
so, does my hair look better --  like this, or...  like this?
who cares?
nadia does, that czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. now, do you think she would prefer --  cool hip jim...  or laid back jim?
what about you?  you are the one with the girlfriend and you are still stranded on third base.
you know, I have never got that shit. what exactly constitutes third base?
contact, dude.
then where does a blowjob figure in?
shortstop.  'course, you do not make it to third, and you are out.
so let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
feels like warm apple pie, dude.
apple pie...  mcdonald's or homemade?
what is up, fellas?
hey sherman.  scopin' the babes.
indeed.  some fine ladies here, boys. confidence is high, repeat, confidence is high. sherman is moving to defcon two, full strategic arsenal ready for deployment.
you have got something going?
did you see that central chick? brunette?
gotta go.
but --
yes.
i thought so.
no...you...go...ahead.
okay.
oh, kev.
vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
tonight?
yeah, it is such a perfect evening. is not this how you have always pictured it?
great evening, is not it?
sure.
there is something about the spring that is just cool.  like the smell of fresh rain or something.
what did you just say?
suck me...beautiful?
uh...you know, my friends call me nova -- as in casanova.
you need some work, buddy!
look, chris.  there are just some things you need to learn, that is all.
like what?
alright, well...you've got to tone it down.  you do not need to go to lookout point and spout cheeseball lines to be romantic.
...okay...
you have to pay attention to a girl. be sensitive to her feelings. relationships are reciprocal.
I am not good in math.
you actually said that?!  haaaah!!
shut the fuck up.
hey, you did better than i did, nova.
oh that is really reassuring.  and do not call me nova anymore.  I am a fraud.
let me know.
okay, do not stop.
suck me, beautiful!
god dammit, stifler!
check-out time!  please vacate the room.
god, i can not believe there are so many cool people at this party.
yep.
here, babe.
thanks.
really?
uh huh.
i do not know if i want to be doing this.
doing what?
you know.  if we hook up, tomorrow I will just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
no way.
he likes it.
of course he does.  what about you? have you just never had one with kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
i think I have had one.
well that is a no.  no wonder you are not psyched about sex.  you have never even had one manually?
...i've never tried it.
are you kidding?  you have never double- clicked your mouse?
jessica, can you drive me home?
sure.
vicky, wait.
not for you.
ow, what the hell?
sorry, i thought you were dead.
good morning gentleman.
finch!  where were you last night? what happened to the foolproof plan?
i thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance.  when i got here, the bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.
feeling better, oz?
I am such a loser.
that is the spirit.
you did it.
fellas, say goodbye to chuck sherman, the boy.  i am now a man.
i put in months of quality time with vicky.  sherman meets a chick for one night and scores?  this is just wrong.
no shit, I am never going to get laid. how the hell am i going to become this mr. sensitive man?
like a bet?
no, a pact.  no money involved.  this is more important than any bet.  now here's the deal: we all get laid before we graduate.
dude, it is not like i have not been trying to get laid.
this is different.  this is better. think of when you are working out, oz. you need a partner, someone to spot you.  someone to keep you motivated.
that is what we are, we keep each other on track.  prior to this day, we have postured.  we have procrastinated. we have pretended.  we have -- well i can not think of other p-words, but we have probably done them too.
pontificated.
separately, we are flawed and vulnerable.  but together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
the sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
guys, guys -- you are ruining my fucking moment here.  now think about it --
so, I am thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
dude, prom sucks.
i know, but think about it -- at the parties that night.  chicks are gonna want to do it.
yeah, it is like tradition or something.
right.  that gives us...
exactly three weeks to the day.
can i come in?
yeah, sure.
you are not...busy?
dad, come in.
okay.
these are for you.  from father to son.
i know, dad.
oh, okay.  here's let me show you.
dad!  i know!
do you know about the clitoris?
yes dad.
sometimes it can be pretty hard to locate.
thank you, dad, i got it.
okay, well that about covers it.
ah, you will get her back soon enough. that is easy, she likes you.  what you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  you got to give her what she is never had.
what?
I will give you a hint.  "ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  comprende?
you mean...and orgasm?
you got it, stud.
well...i'm pretty sure I have --
no you haven't.
but that one time --
no.
well of course I would want to give her that.  i mean, what do you think, i do not care about her?
do you?
of course.
do you love her?
i -- i do not know, you can not ask me that.
well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  that is how i was duped.
i do not want to dupe her, jessica.  if i say it, i have to be sure i mean it.
well it is up to you.  the big l, or the big o.
hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
yeah, i think you sounded pretty good.
i think you need your balls reattached.
keep it down, dude.
what the fuck are you doing here?
this place is an untapped resource. check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are hot.
you dipshit, you are expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
dude, watch me work.  they go for sensitive studs like me.
this is your plan, finch?
yep.
this.  right now.
uh-huh.
you are just going to sit there and drink your coffee?
mochaccino.  actually, in the spirit of the pact, i do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
of course, finch.  what?
whatever you hear about me, you agree.
what are we gonna hear?
you will see.  got to go.  sixteen minute round trip.
finch, do not you think it is about time you learned to take a dump at school?
when was the last time you looked at the facilities here?
i have no idea.  finch showers in a bathing suit.
no -- it is true.  he is...really... big.
yeah, enormous.
say that again, kevin?
uh...i thought you might know a trick or something.  to make her, you know...
try the spicy tuna hand roll.
what?!  how do i do that?
uh -- forget that.  look, is that all you are interested in?  ways to get your girlfriend into bed?
well, no.  i think...i guess it would be good to be able to return the favor.  i mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as i do.
that is good, that is what i needed to hear.  now you qualify.
qualify for what?
you have just inherited the bible.
jim?
it is not what it looks like!
what the hell was that?
sorry.
no, it was good.
oh, well...  it came from the heart.
well then keep it coming.  alright, people, good work!  keep it up and we will do great at the state competition.
not bad, chris.
really?  hey, thanks -- heather, right?
yeah...so...you've got this sort of... bobby mcferrin thing going there.
yeah.  right, uh-huh.  i feel like I have discovered this whole new side of me.  music is so expressive.
okay.  i mean, i agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?
oh sure.  i know what people think. it is like, oz, he is just this kickass lacrosse player -- i also play football, by the way -- but that is like...not all that i am.
of course, i did not --
i mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
you?  you think i do not get that? god, it is like just because i do not get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
yeah...so like, what else do you do?
well the same things you do.  hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  what do you think i do?
i just -- realized that i did not know anything about you.  i was interested.
oh...well that is okay.  cool.
i was being selfish.  and majorly insensitive.  and I am a total idiot.
i think "shithead" really says it.
yes!  I am a shithead!  I am a complete and total shithead!
and i want to try to make it up to you.
how?
oh...ungghhhhh!
shhhh.  your parents are downstairs.
oh kevin -- do not stop!
just a second!
dad, please stop.  please.  I am sure i know what you are talking about.
sure you know, son, but i think you have been having a little problem with it. it is okay, though.  what you are doing is perfectly normal.  it is like practice.  like when you play tennis against a wall.  some day, there'll be a partner returning the ball.  you do want a partner, do not you son?
yes.
that is great.  now remember, it is okay to play with yourself.  or, as i always called it --  "stroke the salami!"  ho-ho, jim.  there is nothing to be ashamed of.  hell, I am fifty-two, and i still enjoy masturbating.  uncle mort masturbates.  we all masturbate.
good work, ostreicher.
thanks coach.
you are a killer, ozzy!
-- thanks, coach --
hey, what are you doing here?
just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  you like, "kicked butt."
um...chris --
you can call me oz.
do i have to?
you can call me ostreicher.
what is your middle name?
forget it.
come on!  i will not tell.
neither will i.
okay.  so i had this...thought, and...this may seem like it is out of left field, and i do not know if you can, but since I am not going with anyone --
yeah!
well, just do not expect oz to pay for the limo.
stifler, fuck --  ...man, you do not have to be so insensitive.
alright, cool.  i got to hit the showers, but...i think this'll be really good.
yeah, me too, okay, cool.
hey, you know, what can i say, i dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
I will bet you do, you little horndog, she is givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
so does your tongue cramp up?
nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
hey, where is finch?
went home to shit.
i do not get it.  how does a guy like that get this sudden reputation?
what reputation?
observe.
okay, explain.
i can't, i have no idea how he is doing it.  and that leaves you trailing, jim.  you got to get your act together.
you are very good in the world history class, yes?
me?
yes.  no.  yes.
perhaps you can help me with my studies?
okay...that would be cool sometime.  how 'bout tomorrow?
well, i do have ballet practice. perhaps i can come by your house afterwards.  i can change clothes at your place?
i suppose that would be okay.
nice car.
I am glad you think so.
you do not like it?
no, i like the car.  by the way, though, about prom?  that was like a bad idea.  sorry i invited you.
what?!
oh, please.  i asked you because i thought you might actually be worth going with.  but you are just a jock. no wait.  you are a jerk.
what?  no I am not.
i saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
i was not making fun of you.
give me a break, you are so full of it.
I will do it.
okay then.  the rest of you okay with that?
why are you doing this?
because i want to.
yeah?  well you can not fake your way through this.  you better practice.
you can do that?
oh -- no way.  i can not do that to her.
you can send me the address too.
well...dammit, if I am doing this, how the hell am i going to watch?
I will save you a seat.
son.  this lady's here for you.
i know.  hey nadia.
dad.
oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. he is a good little kid.  er, guy. man.
dad!!
okay, okay.  I will let you hit those books.
so you need to change, right?
do you mind?  this fabric is so uncomfortable.
did i miss anything?!
just in time.
you know, jim...you could go back there...and...
seduce her.
but, but -- what would i do?
anything!  just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
that is stupid.
no, you are stupid.  get going!  right now!  she is primed!
oh...oh...oh, shit!
oh boy oh god oh crap oh no.
come on, jim.  where are you?
please, god.  let this be it.
he is going in!
james!  you have come in here on purpose?!
well...uh...
shame on you!
uh...yeah...sorry.
well.  you have seen me.  now it is my turn to see you.  strip.
strip?
yes, slowly.
you mean like, strip strip?
for me?
what do you suppose they are saying?
no idea.
uh...
move with the music.
um...okay...
no, no, you must put your whole body into it.
nadia, i can not --
can not what?  do you not want to be with me?  i wish to be entertained, james.
ho-lee shit.
this just got a hell of a lot better.
jim...
oh no.
you are done, james.  perhaps i should be going now.
no, no, I am not done!  I have got reserves!  nadia, please please please.  I am begging you.
did you see this?  this is your more exotic dirty magazine.
yes...james, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
oh yes.  very arousing women.  they arouse me very much.  but not as arousing as you.
holy shit.
holy shit!
no, not again.
i am sorry, jim.  i suppose we will not be doing any studying now.
no!  I have got...reserve reserves!
hey, minuteman.
shut up.  you are supposed to be supportive.
you have still got a chance with nadia, right?
no.  her sponsors here saw the thing on the net.  i do not think they liked it.
how do you know that?
she is already on a plane back home.
yeah?  well come prom night, those excuses are not going to do you much good.
jesus, kevin, rub it in.
hold on.  you have no idea why I am angry?
is it because we have a test tomorrow? sometimes i get cranky when i know i have a big test to study for.
yeah, that is pretty much it.
i thought so.  because, one time?  i was at this --
what was your name again?
michelle.
okay.  michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
really?  you seriously want to go with me?
yes.  seriously.
are we going to steve stifler's party afterwards?  that would be so cool.
whatever you want.
cool!  we are going to have so much fun! it is like this one time, at band camp...
you are not doing the extra credit problems.
no, I am not.  I am writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I am doing the extra credit problems.  mr. bender does not bother to check homework past april.
that is my trick!
it is everyone's trick, kevin.  but i did pick it up from you.
we have come a long way since homecoming.
yeah, we have.  you corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
indeed i did.  but, our relationship. it is progressed a lot.  it is time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.
like how?
well, i feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. when two people share...a special moment between them.
i think you are so right, kevin.
you want to do it?
yes --
kevin?  do you not love me?
no, i do not not love you.  i like, i know that we have definitely got something between us.  something good. something special.
but you do not love me.
i did not say that.  i mean, love, it is like a term that gets thrown around. people say things, they get married, have kids, and then what?  it is like they call it off, going "i was wrong."
kevin...you're not your dad.  the two of us, we are not your parents.
i know, vick.  I am just not ready yet, okay?
okay.
hi...
how did you know i was here?
stifler told me.
you talked to stifler?
well...i needed to find you.  we are gonna have to practice that song.
...okay.  cool then.  I am um, I am glad you came by.  i mean, really.
uh...my dad's the manager.
really?  cool.  tell him his subs are great.
ah, he is always too heavy on the vinegar.  if you really want a good one, you got to let me make it.
my dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and i fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
that is nice.
so you are going to michigan?
yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to northwestern.  i did not want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- i mean, how am i supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  so when my u of m acceptance came in december, i said the hell with it.
onions?
what?
you want onions?
oh, yeah.  so what are you going to major in?
well, state's got a good business school.  and i can probably walk onto the lacrosse team.  green peppers?
yeah.  so wow, you have got it figured out.
well, i mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am i gonna be, a pro lacrosse player?  i really have no idea.
oh thank god, i thought i was the only one.
well, you are not.  oil and vinegar?
yeah.  you know, people are always like, "what're you going to major in?" and i do not know.  and they are like, "you'll figure it out."  yeah?  when?
i know.  salt and pepper?
sure.
so we are going to be close next year?
you -- oh, you mean -- yeah, east lansing and ann arbor.
...yeah.
no comment.
no comment?!  are you kidding me?! I have never seen someone is image change so...so drastically!
thanks.  it was my idea.
did you guys hook up or something?
are you kidding?  no.
then what the hell are you talking about?
well...i guess it is okay for me to tell you now.  that reputation of his is not going anywhere.  finch comes to me and says, "jessica, i need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  so i told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I will tell a couple girls that you are dynamite in bed.  so he did, and i did.
i do not get it, that really works?
duh.  of course.  naturally, i embellished a little bit.  hey, did you hear that finch had sex with an older woman?
oh my fucking god.  you are gay.
come on, you know the words, sing along.
no thanks, you have been singing that shit all week.  if you try that at msu this saturday, I am pretending i do not know you.
our last game is this saturday.
no shit.
...i've got this lacrosse game.  it is really important, it is our last game. and you know, central almost beat us last time, so i really want to kick their ass, and it is like cool because we are going to get to play at state, which means that after the game i might be able to stop by...
you can not sing at the competition.
I am sorry, i totally spaced.  i just...i did not realize it...
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
alright...yeah...thanks for understanding.  so i guess...i'll see you later.
kevin!  you seen shitbreak lately?
oh no, stifler, what did you do?
me?  nothing.  I am the one whose ass he kicked.  I will tell you one thing, though.  i do not think he is going to have a problem shitting in school anymore.
finch!  get to the bathroom!  now!
easy, tiger.  what is in there?
just go!
why is this?
you are going to shit your pants!
charming.
finch, listen -- stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your mocash-chino or whatever.  it is fast acting.  i mean really fast.
first of all, it is mochaccino, and secondly...oohhhh!
christ!  i did not say you were out of the game!
sorry, coach.
what the fuck is this?  you got someplace more important to be?
what about the game?!
I am not playing.
you are missing the game for us?!
no.  I am missing the game for you.
yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
you fuckin' rule!
hey...
did you know that it's...450 miles from ann arbor to nashville?
it is like a six or seven hour drive. that is easy, i do not mind driving.
about the other day...i've been thinking.
so have i.  and i know you want to make things perfect for me.  and i understand that you really would not tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
and i want to make things perfect for you.  you are right, kev, we do have something good...and special.
yeah, we have something great, vick.
kevin...  i want to have sex with you.
now?!
no...i know the perfect time...
you know, at band camp?  we have dances like this.  only they are way funner.  do not you think prom is just highly overrated?
highly, highly overrated.
alright, how do you guys stand?  well, finch, i know where you are, but you can not use that as an excuse.  jim?
my date's a flute-toting band dork. that answer your question?
oz, how about you and heather?  now you guys are a couple or something?
dammit, kevin, what is with the attitude?
attitude?  me?  i think that you guys should be more enthusiastic.  shit, we have been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we have been waiting for.  we are in this together. do not back out on me now!
back out?  you do not need us to get laid.  you afraid or something?
no, but come on guys, we made a pact!
kevin, it was just a --
it was a pact.  you break it and there are no excuses.  you guys have to --
...guess what?
i do not care.
kevin, come on, the bus to stifler's is going to be here soon.
I am not going.
i still think you are okay.
so do i, kev.
me too.  for the most part.
nah.  fuck, you guys are right, i do not know what I am doing.  i mean I am acting like I have got it all together tonight.  but i know vicky is going to ask me if i love her.  and i do not know what I am going to say.  so now it is like, maybe I will just wimp out on the whole thing.
and by the way, sherman did not even get laid.
he didn't?
there it is.  i want to grab my bag. oh, and my date.
come on, kevin.  vicky's looking for you.
stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
it reminds me of this one time --  hey, can i ask you a question?  how come you do not have any stories?  I have got lots of stories, and you do not have any.
oh, I have got stories, believe me. they are a little more risque than tales of band camp.
are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  tell me.
okay.  you want a story?  here's a story.  stifler finds this beer, right?  and...
see -- this is the nicest room.
wow, kev...it's perfect.
there is something I have been meaning to tell you, heather.
what is that?
it is going to sound really bad, but i want you to know.
this is not the best way to proposition me.
no, that is not what i mean.  i mean -- look.  you know what made me leave that game?  coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
this is not any better, chris.
no, see heather, what i realized is that...with you, it is not like I am running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score.  and this may sound corny, but --
oz, it is okay, i know.
you called me oz.
well, that is what your friends call you.  i mean...i feel like I am one of your friends now...and also...your girlfriend.
hmm.  you know that is  really a shitty middle name!
i know, it sucks!
ah, stifler's mom!  thank you for letting us have a great party.
as if there were any alternative in the matter.  are you enjoying yourself?
I am three sheets to the wind, ma'am!
I am so happy for you.  takes the edge off, does not it?  and where might your date be?
oh no, no date.  bathroom incident.
pardon me?
...nevermind.  you have anything to drink?
i believe the kegs are upstairs.
no, no, that is what the cretins drink. i mean alcohol, liquor -- good stuff.
all right, i got some scotch.
single malt?
aged eighteen years.  why do not you get the glasses.  behind the bar.
that is a nasty story!
i told you.
you wanna hear a nasty story of mine? it is kind of sexual.
yeah, bring it on!
well, this one time?  at band camp? we were playing this game, i do not know if you know it?  but it is called spin the bottle?  and i had to kiss this guy named marc wander on the lips?  and...
you comfortable?
yeah, are you?
yeah.
you sure you are comfortable?
yeah.  are you sure?
yeah.
me too.
okay.  did you bring a condom?
yeah, right here.
so, do you want to be -- i mean, how do you want to do it?
i do not know.  how do you?
like, normal style.  the...missionary position.
okay.
yeah vick?
i want to hear you say it.
okay.
victoria...i love you.
i love you.
i can not think of anything to say that is not cheesy.
then don't.
so, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
yes!  and he was such a dork!  and everyone laughed at me, but i did not care?  because it was so funny!
okay, i get it.
oh!  and then this one time?  at band camp?  i stuck a flute in my pussy.
...excuse me?!
what, you think i do not know how to get myself off?  hell, that is what half of band camp is!  sex ed!
this'll do.
now, i have two rubbers.  wear them both, it will desensitize you.  i do not want you coming so damn early.
why, uh, what makes you think that i --
come on.  i saw you on the net.  why do you think i accepted this date? you are a sure thing!
so...would you object if i said you are quite striking?
mister finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
yes ma'am, i am.
i had no idea you would be this good!
neither did i!
are you going to do what i think you are going to do?
do not you want me to?
oh yeah!  put it in your mouth!
okay!
that was a great night.
yeah.
i can not believe we just had our senior prom.
yeah, the time went by so fast.
it did.
kevin, next year...with you in ann arbor, and me in nashville...it's not going to work, is it.
do not say that, we can do it somehow. it might not be perfect, but --
no, kevin --  that is the whole thing, that is what I have been realizing.  that nothing's perfect, that you can not plan everything.
vicky...last night...i was not lying.
i know.  let's go.  do not you have something to tell your friends?
what?
your little pact.  jessica told me all about it.  way to go, kev!
i guess we will call you two-ply.
yeah.  so you want double condiments on that?
no, no that is fine.  so you doing okay?
yeah.
I will tell you, I have learned one thing: women, like wine, get better with age.  of course, i have no frame of reference for this comparison.
so oz, you almost made it, huh?
I will just say that we had a great night together.
hang in there, buddy, you will get there.
i know.
wow.  you two really have something going, do not you?
i think we are falling in love.
it is true.  i mean, after this, everything'll be different.
after getting laid?
after high school.
yeah, but we will still see each other.
fuck yeah we will.
hey.  i got another question for you.
what is that?
