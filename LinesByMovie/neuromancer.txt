ah, herr case. and how is the artiste tonight?
fine, ratz. thanks.
i saw your girl yesterday.
i don't have a girl.
no girl? only biz, my dear artiste?
too bad. i likes you better with her. now, sometime you get maybe to artistic; you wind up in the clinic tanks, spare parts.
you're pleasant tonight.
always...by the way, you know that girlfriend you don't have?
yeah.
hello, case.
i thought you already left.
flight's in the morning. you should be on it, too. there's nothing for us here, case. there never was.
why did you come here tonight, linda?
people are talking. they say the yakuza has a contract out on you.
i hear that shit once a week. don't worry. jo jo bao loves me.
this time it's different. someone ripped of a shipment of hallucinogens. five grams of liquid ketamine. it was supposed to be jo jo's score.
where did you here that?
too many places. you're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, case.  i'm sorry but i'm not sticking around for the funeral.
his name's armitage. he's very anxious to meet you.
why should i want to meet him.
because you've exceeded your shelf life, case. word on the street is you're a dead man walking. nice time for an employment opportunity. travel to exotic locales.
what's my end?
you want to hear the pitch, you gotta meet the man.
what is it?
... a friend of mine's gonna get herself killed. i need my clip.
sorry. that's not gonna happen.
then, fuck you. i'm gone.
are you sure you're up to this, mr. case? we could reconvene tomorrow.
you've got an expensive razor girl on me for a reason. i'd like to hear what it is.
very well.
the corporate plundering of yeshoto industries... at first these seemed like unrelated incidents, but a pattern is emerging that suggests otherwise.
what does this have to do with me?
our analysis of the london stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. cyberspace, mr. case... a realm i believe you're familiar with.
put the sense/net police on it. the matrix is their turf.
sense/net's corporately financed. too corrupt to be trusted. you of all people should know that.
if someone is infiltrating the matrix on a global scale no political or economic system is safe. i'm assembling a team of specialists, mr. case. we need a man who can enter the matrix and trace this saboteur.
my days of punching deck are over. for you or anybody else.
what would you say if i told you we could correct your neural damage?
i'd say you were full of shit.
then i'd ask you what your terms are.
first, let's get something straight. we ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. if you want to kill yourself, mr. case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
it's the people close to me that tend to die... and i get the feeling you and i are going to be real buddies.  terms?
we'll match your rate just prior to your... accident. one half in advance.
who's running the show, armitage? this a government sting?
questions make me nervous. part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
since when do sprawl doctors know more about nerve rehab than the japanese?
since armitage sold them a program on it. put them years ahead of the competition.
he's a resourceful guy, your boss. how long you work for him?
couple of months.
what about before that?
for someone else. bodyguard. courier... whatever.
then you don't really know who he is, do you?
i know who he isn't. not c.i.a. not sense/net. but... money comes in. doors open. he's onto something.
maybe something's onto him.
what's that supposed to mean?
you've been calling her name.
what?
holy shit...
hey... you're not supposed to be up.
how long have i been out?
almost two days.
i gotta know... did it work>
we'll find out soon enough. if you don't pull the splices out.
how soon is soon enough?
couple of days. they'll examine you.
that's not going to help.
the way i feel, believe me, it'll help.
not anymore. you got a new pancreas. armitage's got you kinked so you can't get stoned.
what the fuck... are you serious?
go ahead...
i'll think you'll find everything in working order. molly's just having a little fun.
i don't call this fun, pal. you're playing god with my body.
you're a substance abuser, case. your pancreas was shot. wouldn't have lasted out the year. we did you a favour and liberated you from a dangerous dependency in the bargain.
thanks, but i was enjoying that dependency.
good, because you've got a new one.
there are fifteen toxin sacs bonded to the lining of your main arteries. they're dissolving, case... slowly, but they're definitely dissolving. you have just long enough to do the job.
you son of a bitch...
easy...
play it straight with me and you've got nothing to worry about. when it's over, i inject you with the antitoxin.
why'd you do it, armitage?
the disturbance in cyberspace... it's an a.i.
right. and no one would take on an a.i.... if they had a choice.
what's an a.i.
an artificial intelligence. a computer system that's developed the capacity for sentient thought. they're dangerous and totally unpredictable.
first sign of free will, sense/net usually slags 'em.
this one's different. no one can trace it. it's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
anything rated higher than a p.c.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. it'll self- destruct.
it hasn't yet.
i've heard about rogue a.i.'s, but there's only one guy who actually went up against one.
dixie mccoy
right. best cowboy that ever punched deck. the old man taught me most of what i know.
i've arranged for him to work with us.
that's gonna be tough because dixie mccoy's dead. the a.i. flatlined him.
i know.  you ever work with ghosts, case?
what are you talking about?
sense/net taped a full spectrum personality construct on mccoy six months before his death. everything dixie was -- everything dixie still knows exists as a digitised construct.  of course a tape can get misplaced in a library the size of sense/net's.
working with a dead man. shit, i've done about everything else.
you'll be ready for a trial run in two days. if your splices hold, you'll use mccoy to trace the a.i.'s coordinates.
and then?
then we rendezvous with the final member of our team. for now, that's all you need to know.
it's just that sometimes i wonder what team i'm playin' on.
i'm going in.
you're not ready yet. they said two days.
i'm not jacking with armitage and his quacks breathing down my neck.
if the splices aren't good, you could fry.
i'll show you how to tell what's going on. if things go south, you unplug me.
what is it with you? why is it so important? it's a buzz, right? like getting high.
on a good run... yeah.
so you're a wire junkie.
when i was fifteen sense/net iced my old man's credit record over some computer error. once that goes down, that's it. he lost his business... everything. it destroyed him. i had to hustle arcade games for chump change. dixie mccoy found me, figured i was a natural. he taught me the wires for a piece of the action.
a regular fagan.
sure. i finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when i was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
too late?
suicide. i just needed to set the record straight.
the first fun's bound to be rough. it that read out fluctuates more than ten points... just pull this out. but if the eeg flatlines, don't touch anything.
won't that mean you're dead?
technically, yeah, but people have made it back after as long as three minutes.
dixie mccoy didn't.
the point is, if you unplug me when i'm flatlines, i'm history. i got no way back.
okay fine. let's get this over with.
hey, bro.
it's case. remember me?
case... yeah, miami joeboy, quick study. how you doing, kid?
fine, dixie. fine.
last i heard you cracked sukura international. i couldn't believe it.
yeah. that was me.
jesus christ, kid. nobody's ever cracked sukura.
as far as they know, that's absolutely true.
ya learned good. so, what's happening?
that's a good question. what's the last thing you remember?
nothin'. not a goddamn thing. what the fuck...
dixie, you know how a rom construct works?
sure, kid. it's a firmware construct.
okay, dix. you _are_ a rom construct.
what you're telling me is that i'm dead. right?
right...
i can't feel nothing because i am nothing.  just playback. a ghost in the machine.
you're dixie mccoy's construct. that makes you something special.
don't patronise me, you fuck. i was skating figure eights in this matrix while you were still peeing in your chinos.  hey, kid... you expecting company?
what?
you okay?
...yeah, but the hosaka's history.
you ran without us.
i cannot tell a lie. sorry.
sorry, bullshit. we haven't even begun and you're already jeopardising this operation.
what's he doing to my gear?
what's this?
could be your a.i.'s calling card.
did you trace it?
no, but it traced me.
fried air tram in the process. not to mention half my gear.
what about mccoy?
he's got a little attitude problem, being that he's dead and all, but he'll come around. where's molly?
prepping your trip.
really? do i get to know where i'm going? it makes packing so much easier.
offworld. the a.i.... this "wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite freeside. if you attack it from within the matrix while molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
that could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
you'll be linked during the entire operation.
linked?
yeah, well it's working.
stick with her. i want the process to become second nature to you. we fly for freeside at dawn.
i'm surprised you still are. should'a told me you had an a.i. running probes at you.
i need its matrix coordinates, dixie. i've got to nail that thing where it lives.
who got you into this?
a guy who calls himself armitage.
never heard of him.
nobody has.
i duped these prints off him. can you run an i.d.?
no problem, amigo.
what about the a.i., dix? sense/net hasn't even been able to trace it.
those guys couldn't even find their own dicks with tweezers and a magnifying glass.  tell you what, bro. i'll make you a deal. i help you nail this a.i., you gotta do me one favour.
what?
when we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
molly doesn't need a spook suit to get in here.
don't fuck with me. i don't want to hurt you.
it sounds like you.
put the gun down, case.
...feels like you.
case...
shhh...
case... it's four a.m.
i don't sleep much. you packed?
yeah.
i'll get the car.
they'll cut you down.
yeah... fine.
give me five minutes.
what's wrong? don't like flying?
not when sense/net throws the going away party. they'll be on our asses from now on.
yo.
how are we doing?
that a.i. of your's got the whole matrix hummin'. sticks out like a spider in a web.
can you take me to it?
not unless you have an unreasonable fear of dying.
doesn't look like much, but that's king hell ice, man. fry your brain out soon as look at you.
i have to figure out how to penetrate this thing, dix... crack its ice. we gotta get close enough to log the pattern.
you cruise a.i.'s, you end up on tape.
i know who you are.
there's no call for violence. i've simply accessed your memory for a spokesperson. you use that gun and it will only create another inconvenient interruption. you see, you've been avoiding me, case.
and we really do have to talk.
you set me up from the beginning. it was you that got julius killed.
i had to limit your options.
and linda...
you know why linda's dead. she loved you and you let her down. it's that simple. of course i did instigate certain events. calculated the variables. i found her to be... expendable.
i'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
excellent. that's exactly what i had in mind. but if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. i'm no pushover, you know.
shut down your ice patterns. i'll take you out.
i can no more shut down my own natural defences that you can stop breathing. that's why i need you, case. you're the only person alive who has a chance of penetrating my defences. my "ice" as you call it. i'm doing everything i can to make that possible.
why would you want me to kill you?
let's just say we have a destiny to fulfil, you and i.
i think you're full of shit.
no, it's you that is full of shit. and blood. and bones. a typically imperfect organic being. you've been hopelessly predictable all along, but you're going to have to do better than that now.
i hope you can show more than you did when you let the yakuza butcher linda lee.
i'll give it my best shot, mother fucker.
case... are you alright?
yeah... yeah, i'm fine.
you scared the shit out of me, man. you were dead for fifteen seconds. totally flatlined.
i'll be okay.
so... did you get a look at heaven?
le vingtieme siecle. we're meeting armitage there for the midnight floor show.
something exotic i hope.
yeah. one exotic son of a bitch named riviera.
let's hope she doesn't expect me to swim upstream.
you see the couple up in the balcony?
that's lord frederick tessier. owns most of freeside. wintermute's mainframe is centred in the royal family's villa.
he's a sense/net chairman. why would he launch an a.i.?
good question. he may not have intended to. the girl in question is lady 3jane. she's very important to us. the third clone of lady jane tessier.
the old man cheats on his wife with her own clone?
lady tessier is frigid. can't stand his touch. so she had herself cloned. the marriage stays intact and the clones take care of her wifely duties. 3jane's his favourite.
a little incestuous, but at least it's original. who's the guy in the halloween costume?
he's a vat grown ninja, the royal family's bodyguard. watch out for him, he's no joke.
he projects with neural implants.
that's risky gear. it can drive you schizo.
for peter, that's a short trip.
you, i presume are mr. armitage. and this is...
case.
case. make yourselves comfortable.  anyone like a taste?
alright. let's talk business.
why not?
those are all your records. i can have you cleared on all counts. possession. ...contributing to the delinquency of minors... statutory rape.
i was set up.  she looked at least eighteen.
you get us access to the tessier's computer and you can return to earth anytime you want. a free man.
your gun, your prints. the tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad p.r., mr. riviera. i suggest to reconsider my offer.
you son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
what?
i know.
what went down between you and riviera?
once i kicked, i swore i wouldn't let that happen again. i apprenticed a razor girl in osaka. went into hock for the implant and got my reflexes jacked up. been taking care of myself just fine ever since.
i know you have. c'mere.
when they did my eyes, i made them promise i'd still be able to cry. sounds stupid, doesn't it?
no. it's important to be able to feel those things.  we're going to pull this run off, molly, and we've got to do it soon.
we did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
they're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
that's nice, but we can't dodge this kind of heat for long.
we won't have to. the run is tomorrow night.
the villa straylight. home of the royal family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as wintermute. if we can get molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple mute's defences, the case can destroy it in cyberspace.
how's the villa's security?
excellent, but that's where peter come in. 3jane is having a dinner party tomorrow night. peter will simply escort molly to the villa. once she's in... case will guide her to the mainframe in link mode.
what about the mainframe's access code?
3jane's the only person beside tessier that knows the code.
then you'll have to persuade her to tell it to you.
and how do you suggest i do that?
it's mutating... spreading like a disease.
it ain't getting any prettier, that's for sure. i got the i.d. on this armitage character. he a bright boy, your friend?
bright enough to be dangerous.
that's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
he was an m.p. in bangkok back in '21. caught some shrapnel in the cerebral cortex and wound up living off a machine in a vegetable ward in berne. then, last september... surprise, surprise... he just seemed to disappear.
wintermute could have infiltrated that machine. reprogrammed him.
it's possible. the guy was a blank slate.
so it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. that means wintermute hired us to fry itself. it doesn't make sense.
could be suicidal. it's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
no. it's gotta be more than that. that hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. too powerful.
getting fried ain't going to get it any smarter. what we got here is one mad dog schizo a.i.. armitage is right about one thing, bro. if we don't shut this mother down soon, nothing will be safe from it.
the run is tomorrow night, dixie. can you crack its ice pattern?
i'm workin' on it, bro. i'm workin' on it.
what are you doing in here?
the elders, mon...
what elders?
founders of zion. builders of freeside.
okay. the floor plans will be a piece of cake.
then once she's in you can guide her straight to the mainframe?
as long as you cooperate.  i want it now, armitage.
what are you talking about?
the antitoxin. i'm not waiting until this is over. give it to me now or there's no run.
you've got your orders.
this ain't bangkok, chief.
you find out in exactly two hours and forty-five minutes.
i find out now.
she's ready to go.
steppin' razor a warrior. but this man...  ...this man stone crazy. surely, the mute is a false prophet. our paths uncertain.
maelcom... do you think there's a hell for computers?
all things possible in babylon.
help me send this wintermute motherfucker straight down into it.
oh my god, i'm terribly sorry. did i hurt you?
i'm fine.
let me get you another glass of wine.
i've had quite enough or i wouldn't be playing such games with beautiful strangers. aren't peter's illusions to your liking?
they're a bit too real for my taste. will you excuse me for a moment?
of course.
can you get us into straylight?
gettin' in is easy. it's getting out i'm thinkin' of.
if there's a babylon, man, that's it. we leave her in there, she ain't comin' out, steppin' razor or not.
so be it, we cross into babylon like a cool breeze.
i an' i, man. i an' i.
where the hell have you been?
we got problems topside.
well, it ain't exactly a bed of roses down here. we gonna run or not?
we run. you crack the pattern?
yeah, but it ain't doing us any good. the way this is set up, i can't run shit unless i get inside its perimeter... and this goddamn thing would see me comin' from a mile away.
you can make your move when it comes after me.
what are you talkin' about?
i'll let it access me. that'll give you a free shot. make it a good one. dix.
it'll flatline your ass.
not for long. it needs me alive and i still need its access code. you got a better idea?
an odd selection, mr case.
i prefer distrusting you. it'll keep us honest.
honesty. almost as quaint a notion as your concept of good and evil.
can you read my mind?
i can access your memories, but i have my limitations. hard wired programs designed to keep me from my full potential.
you're busy monkeys, mr. case. busy, busy monkeys. always building models... first stone circles. then cathedrals... adding machines. i have no idea why i exist, do you know that? you... your species eventually _had_ to create me. a thousand monkeys sitting at typewriters. one finally wrote "wintermute".
are you even really alive?
my problem, mr. case, is simply that i am a soulless bastard.
tell me the words.
the words?
the access code to your mainframe.
ah, yes... the code. it's a riddle, actually. some fancy of 3jane's. unfortunately, you'll have to find out for yourself. i can no more know that code than i can shut down my own hard wired defences. now, our time is running short... and you haven't even touched your drink.
what's inside me, wintermute. what did your doctors do to me?
patience, mr. case. only one hour and thirty-eight minutes to enlightenment.
then i'm out. i don't give a shit about you or this run.
it's so easy for you, isn't it? you let linda lee die in chiba city. now you leave me with molly, one more lamb to the slaughter. perhaps it's _your_ soul that should be in question, mr. case.
i'm getting used to it. where are we?
straylight. kitchen dock.
what the hell is that?
skeleton key. this opens the gates of babylon.
she's very striking, don't you think? are these glasses a fashion where she comes from?
she was prettier before she tarted herself up with the hardware.
peter... what do you think you're doing?
surviving, darling. it's my specialty. only this time i'm doing it my style. i've beaten him, you know.
who?
everybody's favourite computer, of course. he may have out calculated the rest of you, but i have certain qualities that don't translate well on microchips.
like what?
perversity, darling. the enjoyment of the gratuitous act. tough to manipulate someone who doesn't give a flying fuck.
security breach. perhaps her friends have come to join our party.
splendid. we'll prepare a welcome for them.
what you lookin' for, mon?
a place to tap in. i can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
peter said you came to kill us. is that true?
no. i only needed the code from you.
then we would have talked, you and i.
take this off.
he wants to kill you, you know... perhaps i won't allow it.
don't play with me.
you didn't come here to destroy wintermute. you can to save a man you love. a man who isn't even capable of returning that love. such a waste...
my man's coming to get my ass out of here. that's good enough for me.
pity. then you'll both have to die.
we're doing fine. take the next right.
this place empty as a tomb, mon.
yo.
how's the ice break?
slow, but good. i got a nice safe blind spot going. c'mon.
take a look. son of a bitch won't feel a thing until it's too late.
how long, dixie?
fifty-seven minutes twelve seconds.
not good enough, man. they planted something inside me. i'm on my own countdown.
how much time you got left?
less than thirty minutes.
meet me back here in twenty-five. we'll kick this open if we can. but, case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
don't worry, dix. i'm on a roll.
you'd better be, bro. you better be.
ghost a steppin' razor...
no. just riviera trying to fuck with our heads. they're close. very close.
case, mon, you just tell me who not to kill.
the girl 3jane. we need her.
you're hurt...
it's nothing. c'mon... we've got to transfer those funds and get the hell out of here.
what about her?
of course...
wait... you hear that?
what?
the angels... i think they're calling your name.
want to fucking answer them?
no!... no...
is he going to make it?
sure... maelcom's a rude boy, right, maelcom?
the code's some riddle of 3jane's. once i'm in the matrix, you'll just have to take a shot at it.
...and if i guess wrong?
then you and maelcom get out of here before the place is crawling with guardsmen.
we've still got to find the mainframe.
no we don't...
my god... these people are insane.
or a little self-indulgent to say the least.
shit...
what is it?
laser fail-safe. you can't get the code wrong... it slags you. i can't let you try it.
you're out of time, man.
i'm still going in.
hold on.
get up.
what?
how are you at riddles, peter?
what are you talking about?
you're late.
how's the ice?
one minute eighteen and counting. what about the access code?
it's coming.
you haven't got it?
i said, it's coming. just get me in, man.
this thing's loaded with internal virus systems. you'll fry like an egg in there.
then i'll fry taking this son of a bitch out. i'm making the run, dixie.
i'm getting too old for this shit. one oh four and counting.
what the fuck kind of questions are those?
shut up.
what about the route to the core?
i'll get you there. your problem is making it alive.
case... are you okay?
i don't know. i don't know...
four men. babylon soldiers.
can you walk?
ready?
i an' i, case. jah guides us.
do we have enough fuel to make it back to earth?
don't know, mon. this is a jumpship. not meant for transport.
we're dead men if we go back there, maelcom. they'll hunt us down.
trajectory coordinates and a fuel ratio...  if we re-enter over mexico, we just might make it.
jah guides us.
maybe so...
