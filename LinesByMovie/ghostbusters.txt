all right.  what is it?
a square?
good guess -- but no.
is it a star?
it is a star!  that is great.  you are very good.
circle?
close -- but definitely wrong.
ready?  what is it?
ummm -- figure eight?
incredible!  five for five.  you are not cheating on me here, are you?
no.  they are just coming to me.
well, you are doing great.  keep it up.
nervous?
yes.  i do not like this.
well, just 75 more to go.  what is this one?
two wavy lines?
sorry.  this is not your day.
hey!  I am getting a little tired of this.
you volunteered, did not you?  are not we paying you for this?
yeah, but i did not know you were going to give me electric shocks.  what are you trying to prove?
I am studying the effect of negative reinforcement on esp ability.
I will tell you the effect!  it pisses me off!
then my theory was correct.
well, i guess some people have it and some don't.
do you think i have it, dr. venkman?
definitely.  i think you may be a very gifted telepath.
excuse me for a minute.  ray, I am right in the middle of something here.  can you come back in about an hour?
peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the new york public library on fifth avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  it blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  scared the socks off some poor librarian.
sure.  that is great, ray.  i think you should get down there right away and check it out.  let me know what happens.
no, this one's for real, peter.  spengler went down there and took some pke readings. right off the top of the scale.  buried the needle.  we are close this time. i can feel it.
okay.  just give me a second here.  i have to leave now but if you have got some time I would like you to come back this evening and do some more work with me.
eight o'clock?
i was just going to say "eight."  you are fantastic!
spengler and i have charted every psychic occurrence in the tri-state area for the past two years.  the graph we came up with definitely points to something big.
ray, as your friend i have to tell you i think you have really gone around the bend on this ghost stuff.  you have been running your ass off for two years checking out every schizo in the five boroughs who thinks he is had an experience.  and what have you seen?
what do you mean by "seen?"
looked at with your eyes.
well, i was at an unexplained multiple high-altitude rockfall once.
uh-huh.  I have heard about the rockfall, ray. i think you have been spending too much time with spengler.
oh!  you are here.
what have you got, egon?
oh, this is big, peter.  this is very big. there is definitely something here.
egon, somehow this reminds me of the time you tried to drill a hole in your head.  do you remember that?
hello, I am roger delacorte - the head librarian.  are you the men from the university?
yes.  I am dr. venkman and this is dr. stantz.
thank you for coming.  I would appreciate it if we could take care of this quickly and quietly.
one thing at a time.  we do not even know what it is yet.
what is that got to do with it?
back off, man!  I am a scientist!
what is it?
it looks like a big pair of breasts and a pot belly.
i told you it is real.
what do we do now?
i do not know.  talk to it.
what do i say?
anything!  just make contact.
hey, lady?  lady!  can you talk?  who are you?   this is not working.  think of something else.
okay.  okay.  i got it.  i know what to do. stay close.  i have a plan.
did you see it?  what was it?
we will get back to you.
"get her?"  that was your whole plan?  you call that science?
i guess i got a little overexcited.  was not it incredible!  I am telling you, this is a first.  you know what this could mean to the university?
oh, yeah.  this could be bigger than the microchip.  they will probably throw out the entire engineering department and turn their building over to us.  we are probably the first serious scientists to ever molest a dead old lady.
spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
I am always serious.
wow!
if you guys are right, if we can actually trap a ghost and hold it somehow, i think i could win the nobel prize.
if anyone deserves it, it is spengler and me. we are doing all the hard research and designing the equipment.
yeah, but i introduced you guys.  you never would have met if not for me.  that is got to be worth something.
i trust you are moving us to a better space somewhere on campus.
no, we are moving you off campus.  the board of regents has decided to terminate your grant.  you are to vacate these premises immediately.
this is preposterous!  i demand an explanation.
fine.  this university will no longer continue any funding of any kind for your group's activities.
but why?  the students love us!
dr. venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  you, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  you are a poor scientist, dr. venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this university.
i see.
you said you floored 'em at the regents' meeting.
ray, i apologize.  i guess my confidence in the regents was misplaced.  they did this to galileo, too.
this is like a major disgrace.  forget m.i.t. or stanford now ... they would not touch us with a three-meter cattle prod.
you are always so worried about your reputation.  we do not need the university. einstein did his best stuff while he was working as a patent clerk.'they can not stop progress.
do you know what a patent clerk makes?  i liked the university.  they gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we did not have to produce anything!  I have worked in the private sector.  they expect results. you have never been out of college.  you do not know what it is like out there.
let me tell you, ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  call it fate, call it luck, karma, whatever.  i think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
for what purpose?
to go into business for ourselves.
you will never regret this, ray.
my parents left me that house, i was born there.
you are not going to lose the house. everybody has three mortgages these days.
but at nineteen percent interest!  you did not even bargain with the guy.
just for your information, ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
will you guys relax?  we are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - professional paranormal investigations and eliminations.  the franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
but most people are afraid to even report these things.
maybe.  but no one ever advertised before.
wow!  does this pole still work?
this might do ... i do not know ... it just seems kind of "pricey" for a fixer-upper, do not you think?  we are trying to keep our costs down.  you know how it is when you are starting a new company.
oh, dana, it is you ...
hi, louis.
... i thought it was the drug store.
are you sick, louis?
oh, no, i feel great.  i just ordered some more vitamins.  i see you were exercising. so was i.  i taped "20 minute workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and i got a really good workout. you wanna have a mineral water with me?
no thanks, louis.  I am really tired.  I have been rehearsing all morning.
okay.  I will take a raincheck.  i always have plenty of mineral water and other nutritious health foods, but you know that.  listen, that reminds me, I am having a party for all my clients.  it is going to be my fourth anniversary as an accountant.  i know you fill out your own tax return, but I would like you to come being that you are my next door neighbor and all ...
oh, that is nice, louis.  I will stop by if I am around.
you know you should not leave your tv on so loud when you go out.  that creep down the hall phoned the manager.
i thought i turned it off.  i guess i forgot.
everybody can relax.  i found the car.  how do you like it?
do you think it is wide enough?  how much?
fourteen hundred.
you are very handy, i can tell.  i bet you like to read a lot, too.
print is dead.
that is very fascinating to me.  i read a lot myself.  some people think I am too intellectual.  but i think reading is a fabulous way to spend your spare time.  i also play racketball.  do you ever play?
is that a game?
it is a great game!  you should play sometime.  i bet you would be good.  you seem very athletic.  do you have any hobbies?
i collect spores, molds and fungus.
oh, that is very - unusual.
i think it is the food of the future.
remind me not to go to lunch with you.
hello.  I am peter venkman.  may i help you?
yes ... well ... I am not sure.  what i have to say may sound a little ... unusual.
we are all professionals here, miss ...
barrett.  dana barrett.
why do not you step into the office and we will talk about it.  hold all my calls, janine.
what calls?
... and then i opened the door again but it was gone.  there was nothing there.
so what do you think it was?
generally, you do not see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  what do you think, egon?
she is telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
why would anyone make up a thing like that?
some people like the attention.  some people are just crazy.
you know, peter, this could be a past life experience intruding on the present.
or even a race memory, stored in the collective unconscious.  and i would not rule out clairvoyance or telepathic contact either.
is that your professional opinion?
it is in the stars.
why do not i check out the building?  it may have a history of psychic turbulence.
good idea.  were any other words spoken that you remember?
no, just that one word -- zuul -- but i have no idea what it means.
spengler,  see if you can find the word "zuul" in any of the literature.  I will take miss barrett home and check out her apartment.
have you ever thought of moving out -- at least until this disturbance blows over?
no.  if i moved out now I would be acknowledging that what happened was real.  I am not ready to do that.
you play the cello!  it is my favorite instrument.
really?  do you have a favorite piece?
I would have to say prokofiev's third concerto.
that is a violin concerto.
yeah, but it is got a great cello break.
you really do not act like a scientist.
no?  what do i act like?
like a used car salesman.
thanks.  what is in there?
that is too bad.
what?
nothing.  is that the kitchen?
uh-huh.
well, let's check it out.
I will wait here if you do not mind.
you are quite a housekeeper.
i told you, i ...
i know.  it happened by itself.
damn!
are you all right?
yeah, yeah.
there is nothing there now and i do not get any significant readings.
this is terrible.  either there is a monster in my kitchen or I am completely crazy.
if it is any comfort to you, i do not think you are crazy.
thanks.  coming from you that really means a lot to me.
I am a qualified psychologist.  I have got a degree and everything.  i believe that something happened here and i want to do something about it.
all right.  what do you want to do?
i think i should spend the night here.
that is it.  get out.
on a purely scientific basis.
out!
i want to help you.
I will scream.
do not scream.
then leave.
okay, okay.  but if anything else happens, you have to promise you will call me.
all right.
okay.  then I will go.
goodbye.
no kiss?
how was your date?
it was not a date.  it was an investigation.
did you see anything?
did not see anything,  did not get anything. nice girl - no ghost.  I am starting to worry.  you said your graph was pointing to something big.  you told me things were going to start popping.
they will.
do you know when that might be?  we are on the brink of a very serious cash-flow problem.
are not you glad we waited?
i do not know.  it probably would have been the same.
well, thanks a lot.
roy?  your clock broke.
nice going, honey.  it was brand new.
i did not break your precious clock, roy!
now where are you going?
to the bathroom, where do you think?
have i done the right thing?
hey, sweetheart, will you cut that out!!!
uuuuuuugh!!
what is the matter, dear?
thank you for coming so quickly.  the guests are starting to ask questions and I am running out of excuses.
has this ever happened before?
well, most of the original staff knows about the twelfth floor ... the disturbances, i mean ... but it is been quiet for years ... up until two weeks ago ... it was never ever this bad, though.
did you ever report it to anyone?
heavens, no!  the owners do not like us to even talk about it.  i hoped we could take care of this quietly tonight.
yes, sir.  do not worry.  we handle this kind of thing all the time.
i just realized something.  we have never had a completely successful test with any of the equipment.
i blame myself.
so do i.
no sense worrying about it now.
sure.  each of us is wearing an unlicensed nuclear accelerator on our back.  no problem.
sorry, buddy!
we would better adjust our streams.
something was definitely here.
yeah, i can smell it.
I am getting high readings near the air vents.  it must be using the duct system to get around.  see, i told you we would get something.
so far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a puerto rican bellboy.
all right.  let's cool the negative vibes. these things can sense them.
yes?
were you recently in the bathroom?
what on earth gave you that idea?
the wet towels, residual moisture on your lower limbs and hair, the redness in your cheeks indicating ...
you are a regular sherlock holmes.  now what do you want?
when you were in the bathroom, did you notice anything that was yellow and unusually smelly?
ray!  where are you?  are you all right?
god, it is ugly!
ray -- something is here.
where are you, pete?
third floor.  get down here,
sit tight.  I am on my way.
well, hurry up.  the needle's going wild.
it is here, ray.  it is looking at me.
do not move.  it will not hurt you.
how do you know?
i do not know.  I am just guessing.
wait!  wait!  there is something i forgot to tell you.
what?
do not cross the beams.
why not?
trust me.  it will be bad.
what do you mean "bad?"
it is hard to explain, but try to imagine all life as you know it stopping instantaneously and finding yourself confined forever in another dimension.
it is working!
easy ... easy ... I am going to throw in my trap now.
hey, mister!  can i see those guns?
they are not guns.  they are particle throwers.
yeah, yeah.  i just want to see 'em.
i could not do that.  you might hurt someone.
wait!  wait!  let me ask you something.  if you like shot superman with those guns, would he feel it or what?
on earth -- no.  but on krypton we could slice him up like oscar mayer bologna.
wow!
great rehearsal.
you heard it?
you are the best one in your row.
most people can not hear me with the whole orchestra playing.  you are good.
i do not have to take abuse from you.  i have other people dying to give it to me.
i know.  you are quite a celebrity these days.  are you here because you have info ... about my case?
who is the stiff?
the "stiff?"  he happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
is he dying or something?
he is a very close friend.  do you have some explanation of what happened in my apartment?
yes, but i have to tell you in private at a fine restaurant.
can not you tell me now?
I will cancel the reservation,  i found the name "zuul" in ...  the roylance guide to secret societies and sects.  i do not suppose you have  read it.
you must have gotten the last copy.
well, the name zuul refers to a demi-god worshipped around 6000 b.c. by the ... what is that say?
hittites,  the mesopotamians and the sumerians.  "zuul was the minion of gozer."
"gozer" -- he was very big in the sumerian religion.  one of their gods.
what is he doing in my refrigerator.
I am checking on that.  i think we should meet thursday night at nine to talk about it.
i do not think so.  I am busy thursday night.
you think i enjoy giving up my evenings to spend time with clients?  I am making an exception because i respect you as an artist and as a dresser.
all right.  since you put it that way.
I will pick you up at your place.  I will bring along the roylance guide -- we can read after we eat.
I have got to go now.
boy, that was a rough one.
i can not take much more of this.  the pace is killing me.
here's the paper on the brooklyn job.  she paid with a visa card.
here are tonight's calls.
and someone from the epa is here to see you.
the epa?  what is he want?
i did not ask him.  all i know is that i have not had a break in two weeks and you promised you would hire more help.
janine, I am sure a woman with your qualifications would have no trouble finding a top flight job in the housekeeping or food service industry.
oh, really?  well, I have quit better jobs than this one, believe me.
very impressive resume.  electronic countermeasures, strategic air command ... black belt in karate ... small arms expert ... mr. zeddemore, as you may have heard, we locate ghosts and spirits, trap them with streams of concentrated quantum energy and remove them from people's homes, offices and places of worship.
yeah, i heard that.  now tell me what you really do.
can i help you?
I am walter peck.  i represent the environmental protection agency, third district.
great!  how is it going?
are you peter venkman?
yes, I am doctor venkman.
exactly what are you a doctor of, mr. venkman?
i have ph.d's in psychology and parapsychology.
i see.  and now you catch ghosts?
you could say that.
and how many ghosts have you caught, mr. venkman?
I am not at liberty to say.
and where do you put these ghosts once you catch them?
in a storage facility.
and would this storage facility be located on these premises?
yes, it would.
and may i see this storage facility?
no, you may not.
and why not, mr. venkman?
because you did not say the magic word.
and what is the magic word, mr. venkman?
the magic word is "please."
may i please see the storage facility?
why do you want to see it?
well, because I am curious.  i want to know more about what you do here.  frankly, there have been a lot of wild stories in the media and we want to assess any possible environmental impact from your operation. for instance, the storage of noxious, possibly hazardous waste materials in your basement.  now either you show me what is down there or i come back with a court order.
go ahead!  get a court order.  then I am going to sue your ass off for wrongful prosecution.
have it your way, mr. venkman.
hey!  make yourself useful!  go save a tree!
set entry grid.
neutronize.  system shut.
I have got to sleep.
i need two new purge valves.  how is the grid around the storage facility holding up?
I am worried, ray.  it is getting crowded in there.  and all my recent data points to something big on the bottom.
egon, how is the grid around the storage facility holding up?
it is not good, pete.
oh, dana, it is you.
hi, louis.
hey, it is crazy in here.  you are missing a classic party.
well, actually louis i have a friend coming by.
great!  bring her, too.  but you better hurry.  i made nachos with non-fat cheese and they are almost gone.  I will make some more though.
fine, louis.  we will stop in for a drink.
i got the twister game for later ...
that is one speedy mutt.
he is a big one.  you do not want to mess with that particular breed.
definitely some sort of fighting spaniel, i think.
hey, dana.  what is it?  what happened?
i am zuul.  i am the gatekeeper.
we must prepare for the coming of gozer.
okay, I will help you.  should we make some dip or something?
he is the destructor.
really?  can not wait to meet him.  as long as we are waiting for him, I would really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
do you want this body?
well, I will just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
take me now.
actually, it is more of a policy than a rule.
i want you inside me.
i do not know.  you have got two people in there already.  it could get a little crowded.  i want you to close your eyes and relax.  now I am going to speak to dana and i want dana to answer.
i am zuul.  i am ...
right ... you are the gatekeeper.  but i want dana.  dana, speak to me ...
there is no dana.  i am zuul.
whoa!! nice voice.
hey man.  what is it you are so involved with there?
uh ... oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in dana barrett's apartment building ... and they are most unusual.
are you a christian, ray?
mmmhmmm.
me, too.
boy!  solid cores of shielded selenium .325.
do you believe in god?
no.  but i liked jesus' style.
me, too. parts of the bible are great.
the whole roof cap was fabricated with a magnesium-tungsten alloy.
ray, do you remember something in the bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
and the seas would boil ...
right.  and the sky would fall ...
judgement day ...
yeah, judgement day.
every ancient religion had its own myth about the end of the world.
well, has it ever occurred to you that the reason you have been so busy lately is because the dead have been rising from their graves?
you do not have to worry about that with us, sir.
right.  we will believe anything.
it is peter, egon.  I have got a problem.
what is it?
I am with dana barrett and she is floating three feet off the bed.
does she want to be?
i do not think so.  it is more of that gozer thing.  she says she is the gatekeeper.  does that make any sense to you?
some.  i just met the keymaster.  he is here with me now.  venkman?  are you there?
yeah, yeah.  i was just thinking.  it probably would not be a good idea for them to get together at this point.
i agree.
you have to keep him there.  do whatever you have to, but do not let him leave,  he could be very dangerous.
all right.  I will try.
I will spend the night here and get back first thing in the morning.
all right, peter.  good night.
egon, there is something very strange about that man.  I am very psychic usually and right now i have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I am afraid you are going to die.
die in what sense?
in the physical sense.
i do not care.  i see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
that is so romantic.
stantz?  you okay in there?
later, man!!
at ease, officers.  I am peter venkman.  i think there is been some kind of misunderstanding here and i want to cooperate in every way i can.
forget it, venkman.  you had your chance to cooperate but you thought it was more fun to insult me.  now it is my turn, smart-ass.
he wants to shut down the storage grid.
if you turn that thing off we will not be responsible for the consequences.
what happened??!!!?
the storage facility blew.  this one ...  ... shut off the protection grid.
where is the keymaster?
oh, shit!
you turned off the power!  look, there was another man here ... you have to find him and bring him back.  a short determined-looking guy with the eyes of a happy zombie.
see!  they are using drugs.
look at the structure of the roof cap.  it looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker nasa uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
and look at this, peter  cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
i guess they do not build them like they used to, huh?
no!  nobody ever built them like this!  the architect was either an authentic whacko or a certified genius.  the whole building is like a huge antenna for pulling in and concentrating psychokinetic energy.
who was the architect?
he is listed on the blueprints as i. shandor.
of course!  ivo shandor,  i saw his name in tobin's spirit guide.  he started a secret society in 1920.
let me guess -- gozer worshippers.
yes.  after the first world war shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  and he was not alone.  he had close to a thousand followers when he died.  they conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
she said he was "the destructor."
who?
gozer.
you talked to gozer?
get a grip on yourself, egon.  i talked to dana barrett and she referred to gozer as the destructor.
the man is a psychopath, your honor.
probably a mixture of gases, no doubt stolen from the army ...
mr. mayor, it is a pretty simple choice. you can believe mr. pecker here ...
that is "peck!"
... or you can accept the fact that this city is heading for a disaster of really biblical proportions.
are you the gatekeeper?
i am zuul.
i want you to have this.
what is it?
it is a souvenir from the 1964 world's fair at flushing meadow.  it is my lucky coin.
i do not believe in luck.
keep it anyway.  i have another one at home.
thank you.
it does not seem to have slowed him down any.
i do not think it is shandor.
as a duly-constituted representative of the city of new york, and on behalf of the county and state of new york, the united states of america, the planet earth and all its inhabitants, i hereby order you to cease and desist any and all supernatural activity and return at once to your place of origin or next parallel dimension.
well, that ought to do it.
agile bastard, is not he?
forget the trapping!  just blast him!
what is he talking about?  choose what?
what do you mean "choose?"  we do not understand.
you mean if i stand here and concentrate on the image of roberto clemente, gozer will appear as roberto clemente and wipe us out?
that appears to be the case.
i could not help it!  it just popped in there!
what?  what popped in there?
look!
and you came up with that?
the stay-puft marshmallow man!  he was on all the packages we used to buy when i was a kid.  we used to roast stay-puft marshmallows at camp waconda!
great!  the marshmallows are about to get their revenge.
what now?
full-stream with strogon pulse.
on the count of three!  one ... two ...
no!  them!  shoot them!  cross the beams.
no!  you said crossing the beams would be bad.  it will kill her!  and us!
life is just a state of mind.
but it is my favorite state.
oh, sure.  I am getting used to this.
I am innocent!  honest, dana.  i never touched you.  not that i remember anyway.
all right, what happened to me?
nothing!  we just got rid of that thing in your kitchen.
really!  is it gone?
yeah, along with most of your furniture and a lot of your personal possessions.  this one took some work.
thank you.  next time i want to break a lease I will know who to call.
this is going to cost you, you know.  our fees are ridiculously high.
talk to my accountant.
well, that definitely looks like marshmallow to me.
yeah, it is some kind of mallow-type substance - that is for sure.
you have to wonder why anybody would dump a marshmallow that size right in the middle of the street.
i wonder if there might not be a very large cup of hot chocolate somewhere in the area.
that would definitely explain it.
