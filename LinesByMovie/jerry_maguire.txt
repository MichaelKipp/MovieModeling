i have to ask.
what --
where did you find the perfect white shirt?
you are with the sports people on the plane, right?
jerry maguire.  smi.
bobbi fallon.  bpi.  I am producing the coke commercials for the playoffs.
well.  good luck with that --
and i can not say his name without laughing i want to eat him up. i want to say goodbye to every bad thought i ever had about relationships.  i mean, i crave this guy... and yet... why... why did i have that affair this weekend?  does that mean I am not in love with my boyfriend?
i think you will know when you see him at the gate.
it is the death rattle of my singlehood, right? because i finally see the white picket fence looming and i love it/hate it/love it/hate it/ love it... you are right, I will know when i see him. why is it so easy to talk with you?!  tell me about your fiancee.
i uh... do not think we are quite at your pitch yet.
tell me, and then you can sleep.
she is an nfl publicist... amazing sense of style... former athlete... volleyball... world class... really knows how to live every moment of her life, which is why i should take a nap now...
no no...
oh, tell the story.
oh, tell the story.
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of hana on the island of maui...
gorgeous.
a year-and-a-half later, we were both in hawaii for the pro bowl. now I have always hit a wall at 18 months.  every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months.  it is like --ka- boom.  the curse of 18 months.
that is when you need to cement, and define define define.
exactly.  and the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. i knew i wanted to propose, so i took her there.
to the pools?
to the pools.  now she is miss rock climber, and I am more the non-rock climber, but we are hiking up through the pools and there is a fine mist in the air, and i have the ring in my pocket, and I am a little nervous, I am lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "hurry up, klutz."
oh no -- _ 14.
well, it bothered me somewhat. and i got quiet.  and now she is quiet and we are both pouting a little, you know.  and i decide I am not going to propose.  the mood is not right. why be impulsive? now at this point i know she knows that i was going to propose and didn't.  and she knows i know.  so the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we do not speak. and we are both good at that.  we fly to honolulu in silence.  we check into the pro bowl hotel --
how sad --
but wait...
which they do.  and we are standing there. all the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there is even an espn crew.  so i turn to her and sort of grandly say, "well, this is me, klutz, asking you, goddess of rock climbing, to marry me." and i took out the ring, and i do not much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  we are getting married in february.
jerry.  you two will be together forever.
can i help?
oh.  hi.  i work in your office. i was on the junket to the conference. I am --
i know who y6u are.  you are dorothy boyd.  you are in... wait... you are in accounts.  you have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of albert einstein morphed onto shaquille 0 neal's body.
hmm.  pretty good.
now what did you lose?
my son... my mind...
well, thanks.
well, take care.
and have fun at your bachelor party.
oh no.
no no. i knew.
nnnnn.  i just killed the surprise.
no, I am just... anxiously looking past it.  i already had my bachelor party.  it was called "my twenties." see you later.
i think in this age, optimism like that... it is a revolutionary act.
you think so?
oh tsht. yes.
i appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
-- the part about "we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm" --
one-two-three, swing.
thanks.  may i offer you both a ride?
oh no.  I am sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to manhattan beach, taking that left down to little tiny waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I have obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister laurel to pick us up.  thanks, though. bye.
dorothy.  ray.  a pleasure.
do not ever stop fucking me!
sooner... or later... I will have to stop.
oh gawd, oh yes, it is never been better. never better!!
you know.  i do not think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
jerry, this is what intimacy is!
oh -- do not forget tomorrow we have dinner with wade cooksey.
i know about the bachelor party.
who told you?
one of the accountants.
you hear those courtesy laughs, jerry? there is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
oh come on --
this is fuckin michael jordan, man! they should be screaming.
you are imagining it.
dooler, you know bob sugar.
the best commercial director in the business.  i hail you.
... this is... uh... too funny...
they am not laughing, man. something is wrong.
marcee.  how is my favorite player's wife?
jerry, rod is very very upset. tyson, no!
how can i make your life better?
i know you say to take the arizona offer, but my husband needs more recognition.  _ 25.
cronin's okay for lunch?
marcee -- this is one of our agents. this is bob sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
pleasure.
you gonna get that --
not a chance.
marcee, things are changing around here.  you and rod will have my total personal attention.
damn right, and you can start by taking rod's poster and putting it where people can see it!
damn right.
gimme a second here... tidwell... arizona contract... new glass cabinet...
you okay?
I am fine.  what is up?
i came here to let you go. _ 27.
pardon me?
came here to fire you, jerry.
aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there is no scene...
i know.  it sucks.  i suck.
you...
you did this to yourself.  you said "fewer clients."  you put it all on paper.  scully was very upset.  heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him.  you did this to yourself --
... dick?
dick.
give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face!  what i went through knowing i was going to do this to my mentor!  can you get past yourself for a second?
you will lose.
you wanted smaller.
I am over it.  now i want all my clients and yours too.
jerry --
-- and I will get 'em.
you will always be my hero, jerry. always always always.  we are bringing other elements in, we are focusing on endorsements -- it is not about handholding anymore. we are no longer babysitters --
smi represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where is their loyalty going to be?  you stay with me, I would fight for you alone.  you would be my only client on that team...
I have got the clients.  I have got the juice.
alright, we are just getting started on my list of things you need to know. take notes if you want to.
okay.
good, 'cause see, i am a valuable commodity.  i go across the middle. i see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, i tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." that is new york steak, baby.  rare. and yet, nobody's giving me love. nobody's giving me props.  nobody. i went to arizona state, I am from arizona, i break arizona records, I am a sun devil, man!!!
now you want arizona dollars.
exactly.  and I am sitting here with an ant problem, look!  and my brother tee pee's room is flooded with water.  say hello to jerry maguire --
--  now to recap, i want to stay in arizona, i want my new contract, i like you, you are nice to my wife, i will stay with you, that is what I am doing for you, but here's what you are going to do for me. you listening?
mmm.  hmm.
it is a very personal, very important thing.  it is a family motto.  so i want to share it with you.  you ready?
yes.
here it is.  "show me the money."  show.  me.  the.  money. _ 36.
i got it.
now does not that just make you feel good to say it?  say it with me.
show.  me.  the.  money.
congratulations.  you are still my agent.
wonder what he said.
my favorite aunt is hearing impaired. he said "you complete me." _ 40.
so i know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
sure. yes. medical, i do not know.
and i guess we did not talk about money.  so, I will just dive in --
give me your number.  I will call tomorrow.  I am just a little. I am a little insane right now.  but it is going to be great.
no no, i know --
but i mean really... wonderfully...  great.
absolutely.
that took guts.
same to you.
what about medical?
of course, medical! _ 42.
you are a single mother.  you have given up the right to be frivolous.
if you would read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
you know how much those well child exams cost --
of course i know --
wait. where is he?
he is in the living room asleep.
the power move is to go unannounced.  black suit, right?
and the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  tell me again, how was it left with cush?
"dad says we gwan sleep on it.
ugh!
seventy-two clients.  one stayed.  jacket on, tie in pocket. _ 44.
good.  they are all heatseekers!  all of them, everybody. you keep one superstar and they will all follow. there is no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, jerry maguire, was you.
i think i was trying to sleep with you at the time.
well, it worked, and i will not let you fail.  you are jerry ma- fuckin-guire.
that is right.
king of the housecalls! master of the living room!
okay, this is working.
you are not a loser.
who said anything about "loser?" where do you get this word "loser?"
I am sorry.  i was on a roll.  i meant something else.  when do you want to leave?
now.
let's go.  I will drive you. _ 45.
matt, i came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to smi.  but to me --
we decided to stay with you.
oh, thank you.
told myself -- if he shows up, we will stick with him.
you know, I am not a hugger and yet... i can not let go.
i want him to go number one in the draft, and i want him to play.
it is either going to be denver or san diego trading up to take him.
denver is where he should be.
I will give it everything.
you know i do not do "contracts." but'cha do have my word, and it is stronger than oak.
honey -- later, okay?  whoop.  wait.
hello?
sorry, that is my son and the nanny. i had the calls transferred to my home so i could go over your stuff.
no, that is fine.  what calls came in today?
wait.  that is yesterday, from the other office. today is...
... light.
shit, it is just so frustrating to not be able to talk to avery --
dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. we are so very very back.  i re-signed cush. we are set.
we are?
it is all going to work.
i just got goosebumps.
it is all going to work.  we are going to save the world.
well, I am happy for you.
happy for us.
happy for us... okay.  here's the number. 404-453-2222.
thanks.
call me later, hon.
wait.  did i just say "hon" to him?
yeah, dotty. you did. _ 50.
i know.  sorry i threw a scare into our lives there --
do not worry about it -- i never told you what i thought of that memo either --
well, no you did not --
you lost your head, it happens.  I am so fuckin jazzed!  listen. I am going to have to fly to chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the dallas airport and we all fly into new york together for the draft?
it is a plan --  -- _ 51.
hey, man, you know they have big balloons built into cars?
no.
they do, my brother.
I am not your brother!
okay, have we gone over everything? back on tuesday, right?
yep.  have a good time at school, ray.  wish me luck.
let me think about that.  want something to drink?
i see what you are saying.
wait.  what do you mean?
this can not be happening to me.
jerry!  do something --
at last i find you.
why the fuck am i here?  i feel like I am five years late for the prom.
i came all the way here for that? to walk the lobby?
yeah.  and it might have even worked too.
let's do it again.
you believe they are shooting a nike ad down there?  did i ever tell you my nike story?
i gotta get back to cushman.
okay, i understand.  I will boil it down for ya.  fuck nike.  all they do is ignore me...
you are loving me now, are not ya?
I am not about love -- I am about "showing you the money."
good.  i was just testing ya.  but just you saying that? makes me love ya.
get some sleep.  see you tomorrow.
sure you do not want to go out and find some karoake?  I am a very good singer, man --
call me tomorrow.
i might call you later!
cush, matt -- we have a decision to make.
"it's okay to eat fish, 'cause they do not have any feelings...
okay. san diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  it is big.
"something in the way.  yeah."
what happened to denver?
denver got very silent about a day ago.  san diego's got a fever for cush.  this stuff tends to happen the night before a draft.  people get crazy.  and san diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. signing bonus of eight.  million.
reporters, jerry.  they been callin' all night.
just be friendly and say "no comment."
talking and saying nothing, man, it is an art i have not mastered.
not right now, jerry.
do i know everything there is to know here?  you fellas are not talking with bob sugar, are you?
apparently, denver wanted to deal with him instead of you.
said who?  sugar?
hey, I am learning as i go.
so you empowered bob sugar to deal with denver behind my back?
I am sorry, i --
i brought denver to twenty million. denver deals with me all the time. you listened to sugar? you let that snake in the door.
now.  wait.  you did not actually sign with sugar, did you? tell me you did not sign.  because I am still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing --
we signed an hour ago.  you were in the lobby with the black fella.
i just heard.
what do i do?  how do i spin this?
oh honey.  it is spun.
it is all about you, is not it? soothe me, save me, love me --
could you just stop moving?
i have to finish my job --
everything's on the fucking run! everything --
jerry.  you and i are salespeople. we sell --
look, i do not want a --
it is not "love me."  it is not "trust my handshake."  it is make the sale. get it signed.  there should not be "confusion" about that.
go ahead.  jump right on into my nightmare.  the water's warm. _ 65.
tell you what -- I would prefer loyalty..
what was our deal when we first got together?  brutal truth, remember?
i think you added the "brutal."
do not say it.  we are both ragged out right now.
-- stop --
listen to me!
no.
it is over --
did not hear it.
there is something missing here.
you have never been alone and you can not be alone --
listen to me, it is over.
no one has ever dumped me.
I am not trying to make history. _ 67.
i did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of el capitan in 6 hours! i can make this work.
no.
oh jerry.
you know i did not ever want to hurt you.
you love me now, do not you?
very much.
rod --
you feel bad you tested positive? quit doing blow!  you feel bad about your baby girl? why did you leave the mother?
what are you doing with me, rod?
huh?
do not you even see -- I am finished. I am fucked. twenty-four hours ago, i was hot. now... I am a cautionary tale!
see this jacket I am wearing?  you like it?  i do not really need it, because I am cloaked in failure. i lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. they will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. why? let's recap. because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, i had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page manifesto of doom!
well, boo-fucking-hoo.
the least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
no.
it is a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. _ 69.
you are not allowed to act this way.
why not?
man, i got a shelf life of ten years, tops!  my next contract's got to bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I am out of this sport in five years.  what is my family going to live on? what you get me.  so i do not want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya."
another drink please.
anybody else would have left you by now, but I am sticking with you. i said i would. and if i got to ride your ass like zorro, you are going to show me the money.
oh my god.
he is coming over.
at eleven at night? _ 70.
he just lost his best client.  he called from the plane.  i invited the guy over.
dotty -- this is not "guy.". this is a "syndrome."  it is called early midlife, about-to-marry, hanging onto the-bottom-rung dear- god-don't-let-me-be-alone, i'll- call-my-newly long-suffering- assistant-without medical-for- company syndrome.  and if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
honey, he is engaged.  and for the first time in my professional life, I am a part of something i believe in.
hey you.
hi.
thanks for inviting me over. where is the little guy?
he is asleep.  watch out for that lamp.
I am glad you are home.  that "alone" thing is... not my specialty...
oh my god.
yeah.  that too.  i broke up with avery.
too bad.
better now than later.  we will still be friends. I am dying here.
jesus, it is a real gash, is not it?
and just think if i got her the ring she really wanted.
sorry.  uh, let me see, have a seat. I will get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
do you have something to drink?
sure --
beer okay?
yeah, thanks.
i heard.
no kidding.  i looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
this guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  wait.  use the frosted glasses.
thank you.
look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, i warmed it up -- _ 74.
that is the girl i love.
but you just got to hear me out on one thing.  you are very responsible with ray and you know it is not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
as opposed to twenty angry women?
hi.
hi ray.
I have got a 24 hour a day reminder of roger, for the rest of my life. i have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours i might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  look at me, laurel, look at me.  I am the oldest 26 year old in the world!  how do i look?
good.
thanks.
and then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and i love the zoo. do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
wait.  i want to tell you more about my dad.
let's go the zoo.
okay.  I have been hogging it. you are right.  _ 76.
let's go right now.  let's go to the zoo.
aw, the fucking thing... i mean, the zoo is closed.
you said "fuck".
yeah i know.  i did.
i will not tell.
we will go to the zoo sometime. okay? i think i might have some time on my hands.
i do not see any.
funny.
funny...   i better go to bed.
drinks.  food.  plus, i called you a cab.
good idea.  thank you.
do not worry about me.  i can get jobs --
we will be fine!
-- especially one like this.
and i am...
truth?
sure.
me too.
what you wrote inspired me. _ 79.
I am working with you because of that memo...
mission... statement...
well.
sorry about this hand.  you know that feeling -- you are not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
do not worry about it, boss.
oh shit.  you said "boss."
yeah, i did.
now i feel like clarence thomas.
no.  no do not feel like clarence thomas.
no, i do.  i feel like clarence thomas.  I am like... harrassing you... right now.
i may not sue.
well, good evening.
good evening.
did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?"
uh, not today, but --
john taylor.  j.j. stokes.  andre rison.  i smoke all these fools, and yet they are making the big sweet dollars. they are making the money, and i got an agent that am not even put the number on the table.
i understand your anxiety.
maybe you don't.  because it is not just the money i deserve.  it is not just the "coin."  it is the...
--  the kwan.
that is your word?
yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. the package.  the kwan.
but how did you get "kwan?" _ 82.
i got there from "coin," dude. coin, coin... kwaaaan.
great word.  towel?
no, i air-dry.
rod, i say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
is that your porty or mine?
you.
you are telling me to dance.
no, I am saying to be --
"love me love me love me... put me on t.v."  that is the iconography of rascism, man!
rod, I am not a rascist.  I am telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. way back when you were a kid.  it was not just about the money, was it?
do your job, man, do not tell me to dance.
fine.
what is wrong.
forget it.  forget it.
no tell me. _ 84.
I am out here for you!  you do not know what it is like to be me out here for you. it is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that i will never fully tell you about! okay?! help me help you help me help you.
you are hanging by a very thin thread, dude.  and i dig that about you.
dennis wilburn called from arizona to say he is faxing in the new tidwell offer on thursday morning, and you will be happy.
happy. he said "happy?"
actually he said "glad." _ 85.
good.  good.  glad is good.
plus, you could use that commission.
i sunk most of what i had into this condo, which devalued, and --
you do not have to explain.
look, the other night, i want to apologize.
yeah, what happened there.
we are two people working together and we can not have an atmosphere.
I am relieved you said that.
i mean, the other night was... i felt like you understood something i could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk --  -- but we have a company here to think about.  i will not ever take advantage of you in that way again.
oh good.
you walked out on a job for me, and i will not ruin that.
exactly because i know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
wow.  that is more than a dress. that is an audrey hepburn movie.
yeah -- guess i got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  you meet chad the nanny?
yeah, i did -- am i dressed okay? i guess i did not realize we were...
do not let him stay up too late.
hey, man, tonight I am going to teach ray about jazz.
good, that will put him to sleep early. no offense.
we will see you soon, honey. bye.
bye you guys. _ 88.
forgot your keys --
that is the first time i ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, was not that just... thrilling?  i mean, he must have been needing that.
no no.  do not cry at the beginning of the date.
oh, knock it off! _ 89.
it was laziness1 my whole breakup with avery. you know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." it is one of the great lies, right? someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
maybe love should not be such hard work. i know, but --
maybe you should call her.
no no no.  i just underestimated her...  her temper, i guess.  why are we even talking about this?
yeah.  it was not like my marriage to roger was so great, even before --  jerry?
what?
let's not tell our sad stories.
well -- this would be goodnight.
good night.
i think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
same to you.
no.  i have to go in.  i live here.
right.  I will come in.
okay. wait here a second.  do we really want to do this?
oh hell yes.
he is asleep, right?
yeah, how did it go with sportboy?
still going.
first you gotta tell me something.
no--
because I am worried that you are putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
please, if i start talking --
guys are just different people when they are hanging onto the bottom rung.
easy, hon, i was just looking for fun details --
oh, well, why did not you say so? and oh, i do not know if you are interested in this detail, but i was just about to tell you that i love him.  i love him, and i do not care what you think.  i love him for the guy he wants to be, and i love him for the guy he almost is. i love him.
oh god.
easy, easy --
what is going on, jerry?
a lot.  we got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
I will go back to them.
and say what?  "please remove your dick from my ass?!"
okay, we do not take this emotionally. we roll with this problem.
what are you talking about -- "don't get emotional." if you ask me, you have not gotten emotional enough about this man. _ 98.
marcee --
what do you stand for???
another time, okay dorothy?
fine, i just --
and i appreciate that impulse.
if you get injured, you get nothing.
will not happen.  I am strong in my mind.
it is a risk.
I will get you some quick work --
good deal, man.
I am sorry what i said back there.
do not be silly.
my husband believes in you.  we are going to make it.  bye bye dorothy.
look, rod, just get on the camel!
bill, rod, wait --
dude, know your art form.  if you put the camera down here, looking up, i look more powerful.  there is no need for a camel... you got me.
rod, get on the camel.
airight.  enough.  I am pulling him out of this.  this is not what i had in mind anyway.
then you should not have begged me to hire him.
can i ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
oh, we gonna be friends now?
what do you know about dating a single mother?
oh i know plenty.  i was raised by a single mother.
tell me, because it is been a month, and she is about to take another job in san diego.
first, single mothers do not "date." they have been to the circus, you know what I am saying? they have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. you love her?
how do i know?
you know when you know.  it makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. you know?
no, i do not know.
then you gotta have the talk.
but i sure do not like that she is leaving.
well, that am not fair to her.  a single mother, that is a sacred thing, man. _ 103.
the kid is amazing.
no.  a real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
i did not "shoplift the pooty."  we were thrown together and -- i mean it is two mutual people who --  alright, i shoplifted the pooty.
shame on you.  shame on you.
show me the animal, jerry!
right up ahead, buddy --
-- i give you my favorite animal in the zoo.  are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
I am scared.  what is it?
it is in a cage.  do not be scared of...
sure you are okay to drive this?
this rig? phht.  no problem.
so I will see you this weekend.
what --
look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  do not make a joke of your life. go back and read what you wrote. you are better than the rest of them, better than the bob sugars, and do not forget it.
if i said that, would you stay?
no no.  do not do that.  do not say that if you don't...
will you marry me?
you never had the talk, did you?
no.
well, this was another way to go.
now go kiss your daddy, quick.
that is why they cheer, you know. the white man sending the black man into battle...
tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on.  jerry alongside. the quarterback sucks, man.  he is going to get me killed.
I am a little worried --
I am worried too.  I am worried that the only reason I am here getting my brains blown loose is that you were not asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago.
we can still take the offer, rod.
no.
well, just stay healthy. i will show you the kwan.
hey, that is my word, okay?
I am going to have the game of my life on monday night football, and show all these motherfuckers.
take care, okay? you are my entire client roster.
do not i know.  now go home to your wife.
what is that supposed to mean?
why are you even here, man? you could have told me all this over the phone.
i do not know -- how is "dedication" for an answer?
you do not want to go home, do you?
why are you doing this to me, rod?
I am asking you a question --
no, you are --
I am trying to talk to you.  how is your marriage?
not everyone has what you have.
then why did you get married?  I am asking you as a friend.
you are jabbing at me. _ 112.
I am sorry i asked.
no, I am going to answer you.  you want an answer?  I will give it to you.  loyalty.  she was loyal.  everything grew from there.
that is an answer.
damn right.
for loyalty, you buy a dog.  for love, you get married.
look.  I am happy to entertain you, as always, but i have a question for you.  are we really "friends?"
why not --
well, friends can tell each other anything, right? if we have our "friends" hats on --
i think so.
airight.  here's why you do not have your ten million dollars yet. you are a paycheck player.  you play with your head.  not your heart.  in your personal life?  heart. but when you get on the field --  _ 113.
i do not want to be friends anymore.
fine.
beautiful.
we still having dinner in l.a.?
only 'cause my wife likes your wife!
i was thinking i hope he does not get injured. i felt responsible.
sometimes i can not tell at all, what is going through that head of yours.
and i really do not know your noises yet.
well, when you wonder, ask me.
okay... i will...
why do you love me?
why do you love me?
it is my fault.
what --
it is not fair to you.  this whole --
tell me -- let me help --
i took advantage of you and worst of all, I am not alone. i did this with a kid.  i was just on some ride where i thought i was in 1ove enough for both of us.  i did this.  and at least i can do something about it now.
well -- I am not the guy who is going to run.  i stick.
i do not need you to "stick."
you want...
i do not know --
...my soul or something. _ 117.
why fucking not!  i deserve it.
dorothy -- what if I am just not built that way?
i think we made a mistake here.
what if it is true?  "great at friendship bad at intimacy." i mean, come on.  it is the theme of my bachelor film --
i know.  i watched it.  i sort of know it by heart.
i do not like to give up.
oh please.  my need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us does not say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. why do not we call this next road trip what it is.  a nice long break.
what about ray?
there is no question you will be friends. of course you will be friends.
so this break... is a break-up.
come on, jerry.  you know this is not easy for me.  _ 118.
jerry!  you made it --
go.  flee.
thanks for coming.
i missed ya.  what can i say?
he is going to have nothing left for next season.  they are letting him kill himself.
can you be quiet?
what did i say?
he should have kept his head tucked down.
shut up!!!
I am not putting him down, i just have a commitment to the truth.
he took a shot.  he is unconscious.
I am freakin out.  oh god I am --
keep the phone open.  I will call back. stay calm. he is got some good doctors out there.
"stay calm?"  I am freakin...
alright, I am freaking too.  but they need you to stay calm.  I will call back. _ 124.
this used to be my specialty. i was good in a living room.  send me in there, I will do it alone. and now i just... i do not know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it was not complete, was not nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because i could not share it with you.  i could not hear your voice, or laugh about it with you.  i missed my wife.  we live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh --  i love you.  you complete me.
aw, shut up.  you had me at hello. _ 130.
no, roy.  I am not going to cry.
-- well, rod, your agent passed me a note before the show. he says that your deal memo has been signed by the arizona cardinals. four years for ten-point-two million dollars.  playing in the state where you grew up.
i... i love everybody, man.  i love my wife.  my kids.  little tyson. my new baby kaydee.  my brother tee pee. i love my friends, my teammates, who am i leaving out?
it is only a half-hour show, rod.
oh yes.  jerry maguire!  my agent! this is a fierce, loving individual, i love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
ten seconds, rod.
and i love my fans, of which he is one. wanna thank them for all my sundays, and of course my monday nights too.  that about says it...
