any word from that gallery?
not yet.
nervous?
...apprehensive. let's not forget these are the people who banned the mapplethorpe show. anyway, california's loaded with galleries.
you mean 'ted bundy's' finally agreed to leave?
...soon as he finishes his thesis.
listen, eric's been "finishing" his for over three years now.
i'm sorry, but i just can't see you veggin' out in la-la land.
oh, i don't know... i think that once i dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... i could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  like fer shurr!
executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back.
thank god!
okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? well then let's start with adam and eve and the snake.
who do i have to blow to get out of here?
a... i gotta go.
happy birthday adele.
early, you are so sweet.
i feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
well dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there.
tonight turned out to be pretty interesting.
the party?
the warehouse. i'm not that drunk.
it was definitely the high point of the evening.
just being there where it really happened. it was different... more visceral.
mmm... i love it when you talk like that.
i thought you wanted to be a writer.
...i do.
then you can write anywhere. let's get out of here, while we still can.
carrie, come on... we can leave anytime we...
no we can't. we can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to california now, right now, before it's too late.
...just like that?
just like that. load up the lincoln... point it west... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.
you're supposed to call me when you lose your job early. i stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
wasn't my fault...
...the police were way out of line when they stopped you from beating that bartender half to death. and no doubt god'll be pickin' on you on judgement day...
i ain't got nothing against god. it's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. what are you looking for?
you be at this personnel office, friday, three o'clock sharp.
what is it?
...janitor's job.
oh man... come on, i don't want no janitor job.
hey. i didn't have the heart to wake you.
thanks. what are you doing?
well, i sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and i started writing.
so how's it going?
...i think it's the best stuff i've done.
...and i think i know why.
why?
because i was there. and for a moment that night i understood how she came to pull the trigger.
this mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
look, fuck the thesis. i think there's a book here. your photographs and my research, together.
a book on the warehouse murders?
a book on some of the most infamous murderers in america. i want to go to where they lived and where they killed and i want you to photograph it.
what i'm thinking is, we can drop down through tennessee, across arkansas and into texas, from there it's a straight shot into california.  "we don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean."
it's about fucking time, kessler! i'd just about given up on you.
we don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out.
what's up adele? dinner ready?
almost.
well... for one thing... they think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact.
i guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
yeah, and in california you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn...  ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... and i heard your first month's rent is free; state law. i figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month...
what'll we do out there?
well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of lucky lager and climb up on toppa' that famous hollywood sign and howl at the moon...
you know... i read once... ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
bull. that ain't right... government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it.
don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
i heard that.
what did he sound like on the phone?
real polite. kept calling me 'sir.'
i like that.
i still think we should have met them first.
beggars can't be choosers. they were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember?
oh, yeah... he had a real thick accent right outta "deliverance."  "still? who said anything about a still? get ya ass up in them woods!"
funny, very funny.
what if they're dangerous?
they ain't dangerous adele. they're writers.
did you settle things with mr. diebold?
yeah i left him with the car... we're all squared up now.
jesus... they've probably got five bucks between them. turn around.
lighten up...
geez, they look kinda weird.
you just smile, let me do all the talking.
how many times you gonna tell me that?
as many times as it takes.
hi, i'm adele.
carrie.
...pardon?
...i said, i like your hair.
...thank you.
tight fit.
best kind.
uh, we can stop somewhere if you and adele haven't had time for breakfast, early.
well, it's like this, mr. kessler.
brian.
well, it's like this, bri'. i don't eat much in the mornin', never have. maybe a beer once in a while; lucky lager's my favorite.
so what do you do early?
oh... i do some work up at the merrick mirror factory, or i used to...
one night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke...  four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... after he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
karma.
what?
karma...  you know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
that french ain't it?
are you takin' the pictures?
...yeah.
is it hard to learn?
not really.
you gonna talk to the people who did those murders?
that's a good idea. unfortunately most of them have been executed.
...too bad.
what happened?
who are you?
his parole officer.
right, i talked to you on the phone. they say it's a torch job, that sound like your boy?
could be.
where would we find him?
hell if i know, crazy son of a bitch said he was thinking of moving to texas.
without his car?
what about the owner of the house...  ...this john diebold, any idea where he might be?
no, but i can tell you he's not gonna be too happy about this.
...diebold?
...that'd be my guess.
looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
well now i'd say that's the least of mr. diebold's problems.
can't hurt.
how much do i owe you?
forget it.
you wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
...yeah, sure.
shush, adele.
early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
we could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
hey, i got some great stuff... it's okay.
no.
me neither. how 'bout you carrie?
you mean because i object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while i'm eating i'm prejudiced?
he can't help the way he was raised. i kinda feel sorry for him.
feel sorry for him? obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
bitch, bitch, bitch!
up yours.
i heard that.
can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? a lumpy mattress, that crummy tv and a crapper.
early, sing me a song.
...and all i'm saying is i think we ought to try and get along with them. that's all.
you try, i'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
carrie.
i don't want to talk about it.
bri'.
where's adele?
she wasn't feeling so good.
...need a hand with those bags?
no, thanks, i can manage.
all set?
fuck!
take your time.
this the book your writing?
it's just a work in progress, kinda rough.
this guy killed a mess of people.
who?
henry lucas.
henry lee lucas. well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
wonder what all them people done made him so mad?
how did he get away with it for so long anyhow?
he almost always killed strangers. spent years moving on from one place to another. that made it real hard to track him down.
you dropped this.
early grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
so you don't do any of those things.
better not, or early'd whip me.
he whips you?
that bad?
...then some.
...hey you're good. thought you said you never played before?
i haven't... i'm a fast learner.
...they never caught that black dolya killer, huh?
dahlia, no.
now why is that?
some people think it's because he never killed again. he just disappeared back into society.
you don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
i always thought it was the work of a serial killer. anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. and again. until someone stopped him.
that your... "theory", ain't that what they call it?
yeah.
you wanna hear mine?
sure.
ain't you goin' to record it?
you lose!
i suppose anything's possible.
i told you how early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
how'd you meet early?
you know i can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
you can?
by the way, i'm not much of a pool player.
shit, it ain't hard to play pool. i can teach you everything ya need ta know.
yeah?
hell yeah! i'll even spot ya a few points first game.
wait a minute. you're gonna hustle me?
nah... how much money have you got?
i'm cool.
could i try that?
what's this?
it's a portfolio of my work.
your pictures. can i see 'em?
sure.
you took this picture?
took 'em all.
that's me.
no it is not!
hold still.
sorry. boy i'll tell ya, if early found a picture of me like that i'd be black and blue for a week.
you shouldn't let him do that to you...
do what?
adele... are you serious?
you think early's bad to me, don't you?
yeah.
my momma's a beautician. guess that's where i get it from. she wouldn't hear of my moving in with early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. ain't seen her in nearly a year now. i wish she'd call me, just once.
what's early been in jail for?
carryin' a gun.
...anything else?
an' resistin' arrest... at least that's what the police said.
jeez... adele!
...well i probably drunk more than my share, anyway... you go on an' have it.
no, it's all yours. it's on me... for saving my ass back there.
who said he's my good buddy?
you sure been acting like you were...  ...out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. he beats her.
how do you know that?
she told me...  ...but only when she "deserves" it. did you know he was in jail?
stop being so fucking melodramatic! if it was murder he'd still be locked up or on parole, in which case he wouldn't be allowed to leave the state.
maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! geezus brian!
ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
...brian hurt his foot.
sometimes... don't know why it is... i get so hot i can't stand it. i just start sweating like a dog. you ever get like that?
no.
...never?
no, never. excuse me.
what is it?
look again!
tell ya bri., i'm still a little sleepy,... think adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta.
siesta.
what's that?
a copy of a tape they found. he recorded everything.
there's more...
i'm finished.
i'm scared. a week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. this afternoon you're out there wielding it around like clyde fucking barrow, for christ's sake! what's with you?
okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, i admit it, alright?  but let's not blow this. not now... let's just get the photos.
i can't believe i agreed to do this.
oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as i wanted you too.
wrong! i was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to california... there's a big difference.
brian i want him out of our car!
why, what did he do?
brian get him out of the car. next gas station either he leaves or i do!
early, what're you doin'?
go back to the car and keep brian there. i don't want him in here...  do it adele... now!
what's your name, boy?
walter livesy.
think. i might just have to kill you walter. how do you feel about that?
not so good. you sure you have to?
i don't know. wish i did.
early, just think...
shut your mouth.
where you from walter?
vernon, florida.
never heard of it, any huntin'?
turkey mostly.
turkey's are real smart. smarter than most people think...
...mind if i hold that bible?
what do you need a bible for?
you think i'm goin' to kill you. well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it?
no sir.
he's a killer, brian... he's fucking insane.
everybody just shut up!
what the hell is this stuff?
it's chinese food. it was the only place open. you said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
yeah but, what is it?
i don't know, they didn't speak too good english.
...well then, that's how many i killed.
if you say so.
damn right i do.
ya see what i'm sayin'?  ha!
...ha.
hey... ain't we getting near the next murder site... bri?
forget about it, doesn't matter.
hell it don't...  ...hand me brian's map there adele. one day i'm gonna pass some store and see your book in the window. me and adele gonna buy a copy for our coffee table.
so tell me... what happened here?
two brothers, prospectors, lived here. up until a few years back.
...and?
they picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
the police are after him, he's a murderer!
...that's not true.
what?
that's not true!
...i wouldn't lie to you, adele. . . i saw him kill that man.
early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. i don't know why you're saying those things. you ain't my friend.
...thank you.
thank you for what?  what are you thanking me for adele?
...i don't know.
well adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. you understand?
he wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
carrie... stop it.
what the fuck is wrong with you brian!? if you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. he is... for real!
shut up carrie, please... just shut up!
...you can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
adele... we gotta do something before early kills someone else.
...there ain't nothin' can kill 'em. they can live for two even three hundred years.
adele for god sake please lis...
there ain't nothing we could do. once early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that.
what's wrong with her?
she had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
you gotta talk to her. she looks up to you, she'll listen to you.
i tried talking to her at the mine. it didn't work.
then try again,
nobody wants to hurt you peaches!
early! stop!!
oh, n'jus what in hell you crying 'bout? i'm the one got hit.
i changed my mind, early. i'm not gonna climb up that hollywood sign with you... i decided. i think your mean, and you hurt people.
carrie, watch for early.
what are you going to do?
i'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. if i can... slide your cuffs free.
what about you?
i don't know.
you two been busy in here.
what happened to adele?
well, let's put it this way.  i need me a new woman.
who d'ya think you're foolin'?  i know you better than you think...
...you're hurting me...
you were plenty hot.
you sick twisted fuck! you don't know shit about me.
...you know what i mean?
...i know i'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
