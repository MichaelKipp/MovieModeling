you want somethin'?

nope.  darrell.
harlin around?
he is up at the look out.
will he be back soon?
doubt it.  he is dead.  the look out's a cemetery.
you own this place?
yep.
then why do you call it harlin's?
'cause harlin used to own it.
but he is dead.
so?
you want to take a look at my car? i think the radiator hose is--
damn.  gonna be another hot one today.
that will make five in a row.  never seen it so hot.  sometimes i do not even want to get out of bed.  I would rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  i was in mexico this one time--
look, pal, I have got places to be. could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  it is busted.
it is your radiator hose.  it is busted.
i know it is busted.  what did i just tell you?
well, you know so much why do not you just fix it yourself?
if i could do you think I would be standing here wasting my time.  can you fix it, or do i have to go somewhere else?
somewhere else?  mister somewhere else is fifty miles from here.  how you planning on getting it there? you gonna push this heap yourself?
okay, I am stuck.  you happy?  now can you fix it, or not?
hey!
yeah, i can fix it.  gotta run over to the yard and see if i can find a hose like this one, or close enough. gonna take time.
how much time?
time.
what time is it now?
twenty-after-ten.
jesus.  twenty-after-ten and it must be ninety already.
ninety-two.  only gonna get hotter. i remember one time . . .
accident.
you got to be more careful.  i remember one time--
yeah, right.  someplace in this dust bowl i can get something to drink?
truck stop up a piece.  not much, but us simple folk like it.
I will be back in a couple of hours. and be careful with her, will you?
just a car.
hey!  you there!
you want something, old man?
do not call me old man.  am not you got no respect, boy?
you want something?
yeah i want something.  i want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
you can not do that yourself?
hell no, i can not do that myself. I am blind.  can not you see that?
I am sorry, i didn't--
what did you think i was doing out here with these glasses on?  sunnin' myself?
i do not know.  i thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
i am not got no eyes.  you want to see?
christ no!
lost my eyes on okinawa.  lost them fighting the war.  fought the war and lost my eyes just so you could come around here and make fun of me.
i said i was sorry.
do not be sorry.  just run over there and get me my pop before i die of thirst.
yeah, sure.  you got change?
change?  you want my change?  i fought the war and lost my eyes just so i could give you my change?
all right, old man.  christ.
get me a dr. peppa!  i do not want no pepsi.  pepsi am not nothing but flavored water.
yeah, yeah.
do not forget to open it for me.  i can not be opening my own bottle.
christ!
i think you would better give your pooch a sip.  he looks sick.
that is 'cause he is dead.
oh, jesus.
i hope you was not pettin' him none, was you?
what the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
he is only just dead.  what was i supposed to do with him?  i can not take him away anywhere.  and nobody wants to take him for me.  do you?
he no!
see.  am not nothing i can do but keep him here beside me.  that is where he belongs anyways.  me and jesse, that is my dog, not anymore, but me and jesse we been pals since the war when i lost my eyes.  he was just a pup then . . .
can i give you a hand, beautiful?
I am just going to my car.
that is right on my way.
my mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
my name is john.  now I am not a stranger anymore.  see how easy it is for us to get to know each other, beautiful?
do you have to call me that?
i do not know your real name.
maybe i do not want you to.
maybe, but if you did not i think you would have kept on walking.
you are pretty full of yourself, are not you?
my cup runneth over, beauti--
it is grace.
may i carry your package, grace?
jesus.
you sure you can manage?
i got it.
do you want me to carry your pack for you?
no, I have got it.
what happened to your hand?
accident.
you should be more careful.
it is very nice of you to help me. that package is kind of heavy, and it is so hot.
no trouble at all, really.
was not nothing.
oh, this is not my car.  it is down a ways.  i should have parked closer. i just did not think it would be so heavy.  i could drive up.
that is all right.  i got it.
it is nothing.  really.
i just got tired of looking at the old drapes.  had them long as i can remember.
that a fact?
i saw these in the penny's catalog, and i just knew i had to have them. you ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
yes, i have.
'course they cost a little more than i should really be spending.  but, damn it, i do not hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  i deserve nice things.
i . . . can not . . . argue . . .
thank you, john.
you are welcome, grace.
you are not from around here, are you?
why you say that?  just because i help a lady with her package?
you do not have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
i just drove in this morning.
drove into sierra?  what for?
did not have a choice.  my car overheated up the road.
good luck it did not happen a few miles back.  maybe they never would have found you.  day like today you would be dead for sure.
yeah, my luck.  i get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
least you can leave.
not until my car's fixed.  i do not know how long that is going to take.
and here I have made you all hot and sweaty.
where you coming from?
all over.  chicago, miami, detroit. just lately albuquerque.
you have been around.
i guess I have got wander in my blood.
where you headed?
i do not know.  i have to make a stop in vegas.  business to finish.  then maybe I will head to santa barbara.  i might be able to pick up some work there.
you just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  you must like taking chances.
if you are going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
what happens if you lose?
i pack up and go somewhere else.
somewhere else.  I have never been anywhere else.  just once.  years ago.  went to the state fair.  it was nice, but it was not nothing.
i could not stay in this place.  i wouldn't.  I would just pick up, do whatever i had to do, and get out.
that is good.  cools you right off.  i saw you watching me.
I am sorry.  i did not mean to.
i did not say it bothered me.
did you like it; me watching you?
i guess.  I have got an ego same as any man.
good, 'cause i liked what i saw.
nice place you got here.
thank you.
must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house.
i guess it must.
what do you do anyway?
a little of this, a little of that. mostly i tell fortunes.
where did you learn to do that?
from my father.  he was the tribe's shaman.
a medicine man?
those are white words, not ours.
nice house for a shaman's daughter. you must be good.
come here.
my face tell you all that?
it tells me what every face tells me.  everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want.  what is it you want?
the same thing you do.
there.  all done.  lift me down.
what?
lift me down.
you can let go of me now.  I am safe.  how do they look.
like you.
beautiful?
like they are made of polyester.
i like them.  i was sick of looking at this room.  i think they add a little life.
nothing like a little liveliness.
no more drapes to hang.  now what should we do?
i have ideas.
such as?
all right, grace.  no more games.
games?
you flirt with me, then you run cold.  you lead me on, then slap me down.  i do not go for being jerked around.
really?  and what game did you want to play?  you carry my box for me, and i fall into bed with you?
i think i can find my own way back to into town.
maybe i like to find out about a man first.  maybe i like to know what he is made of.
I am just flesh and blood, baby. that and a few memories of bad women; just like most guys.  but you already know that.  you read my fortune.  thanks for the lemonade.
you never did answer my question.
still playing?
that is not an answer.  what is it you want?
you know what i want.
maybe i just want to hear you say it.
jake.  i thought you would be at work, dear.
who the hell is this!?
who the hell are you?
I am her husband.
husband . . .?
now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or god help me I will break you in half.
i . . i was helping your wife.  i met her in town.  she needed a hand with her drapes.  that is all.
did not much look like you were hanging drapes.
i swear to you that is all that happened.  i have not so much as set foot in your bedroom.
a lot that means.
grace, tell him.
damn it, grace!  tell him.
if he says that is what happened, jake, it must be true.
i have half a mind to--
is this what it is all about?  you sucker me up here so you can watch the two of us beat the shit out of each other over you?  forget it.  you want to take my head off, mister, i will not even try to stop you.  i deserve it for being an idiot.  but if you are not, i think I will be on my way.
what happened to your hand?
accident.
you have got to be--
yeah, i know.  more careful.
i guess we have never been introduced proper.  jake mckenna.
jake mckenna.  that is a solid name.
I am a solid man.
john stewart.
what brings you to sierra?
my car overheated.  i pulled in to have it fixed.
where you headed?
I have got to make a stop in vegas, then I am heading to santa barbara.
live there?
got work.  i know a man who is got a boat.  wants me to sail it for him.
you a sailor man?  that would be the life.  drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away. a man could pretty well disappear like that.  just sail away until all he was was a memory.  i guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile.
i hope so.  listen, mr. mckenna, about your wife:  if i had known she was married--
it would not have made a difference to you, now would it?  not a wit. do you know why?  because you are a man without scruples.
wait a second--
ah, i can smell it on you.
hey!
that is the sweat of a man who has not an honest bone in his body.  do not be offended, lad.  a man who is got no ethics is a free man.  i envy you that.  beside, i can hardly blame you.  that grace has a mind of her own, and a body to match, do not she? eh?
she does at that.  i knew when i married her she was a free spirit. a woman with her looks and a man my age; what was i to expect?  but you see a woman like that in a town like this and you do not think, you do. so, i married her.  what are you to do, eh?  women.
can not live with them, and you can not shoot 'em.
i bet she led you on good, did not she?  taking you up to the house with that smile of hers.  bet she wiggled her ass in your face more than once.  then me busting in like some wild bear.  bet you had a fire going under you.
like you do not know.
mad like a dog in heat, i bet you were.  i can tell you got a temper on you.
would you?
would i what?
would you kill her?
why would i kill her?
because I am sick and tired of her little games.  because you could do it and drift away on your boat and no one would ever see you again. because I have got a fifty-thousand dollar life insurance policy on her, and i would be more than happy to give the man who does her in a good chunk of it.
I am not a murderer, mr. mckenna.
how do you know if you have never tried?
this is a joke, right?  you just want to rattle me.  right?
got any cold soda?
eh?
soda.  you got any soda?
hablar slowly, por favor.  my ingles no es bien.
soda.  you know.
i call the policia.
no!
no police.
but, senor--
no police!  wait until I am gone.
senor, you need a doctor.
no police!
hey.
hey, your . . . what the hell happened to you.
nothing.
do not look like nothing.
just banged my head.  it was an accident.
another accident?  you got to be more careful.
look, i just want to pick up my car.
she is all yours. put a new hose in it, and she runs like a dream now.
how much?
well . . . parts, labor . . . let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks.
how much!?
hundred-fifty.
to replace a god damn radiator hose!?
a god damn radiator hose in a sixty- four-and-a-half mustang.  you know how long it took me to find that hose?
about an hour and a half, because that is all the longer I have been gone.
that is about an hour and a half longer than i usually spend looking for parts.  you are the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  what you expect but fancy damn prices?
that is a ford, not a ferrari.  you going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a ford?
that is not just a ford, that is a sixty-four-and-a-half mustang.
what is that got to do with the radiator hose?
i do not know, but it is the reason I am living here and you are just passing through.  now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars.
it might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because i do not have the money.
then you am not going to have the car.
listen, man.  i got rolled half and hour ago for everything i had.
then you are only a hundred-forty- five in the hole.  now why do not you just take your visa express silver card, call karl malden and have him send you the money lickity split.
i do not have a credit card.  they took my wallet.
now that is too bad.  i sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you are going to have to work this one off.
you son of a bitch!
sweet talk me all you want, i still want my hundred-forty-five dollars.
john, what a surprise.  i expected to be seeing you, not talking to you over the phone.
i know, mr. vesci.  i know.  i was on my way to you, it is just . . . what a day I have had.  you are not going to believe what is happened to me. i had the money, i swear i had it. i was on my way to you when my car breaks down in the middle of nowhere.
that is a shame, john.  a real shame.
you do not know the how, mr. vesci. and that is not the half of it.  I have got your money, and i go into this little grocery store to get something to eat and it gets robbed.
let me guess.  this robber; he gets your money.
no.  he gets shot by the old lady.
the old lady?
with a shotgun.  it kills him, and it shreads the money.  i mean, what are the odds?
you are the gambler.  you tell me.
i had to beat it before the cops showed up.  i do not have a cent to my name.  i can not even get my car out of the garage.  i tell you, mr. vesci, if it were not for bad luck i would not have any at all.  so, i was wondering if you could wire me a hundred fifty-dollars so i could get my car.  I will pay it back with the rest of the money.
let me get this straight:  you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars, you call me - collect - then ask me to wire you one-hundred-fifty dollars just so you can get your car fixed.
a hundred-forty-five really.
a hundred and . . . now you listen to me you deadbeat, little punk:  i do not care if you got hit by a truck and run over by a steamroller.  you owe me thirteen-thousand dollars and i want it.  i do not care how you get it, or where from, but i want it on my desk tomorrow, or I will show you what real bad luck is.
do you understand me you little fuck?
yes, mr. vesci.
and john, do not make me come look for you.
fucking kid.  and look at you; breaking fucking pencils.  you are a neanderthal.
hello?  hello!?  operator, i got disconnected.  hello . . .
one-hundred-thirteen degrees.  that was back in july of forty-seven. now there am not no way it is going to be hotter than that.
hundred and eight already.
hundred and eight am not a hundred and thirteen.
will be.
you am not nothing but an old fool.
you got two years on me.  what is that make me?
it is nonsense.
it is not.
a coin's got two sides.  when you flip it there is a fifty-fifty chance it will be heads or tails.  boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it will come up each side.
it will.
no it won't.  you just do not know shit about statistics.
and what are you?  a rocket scientist?
i got more brains than you have got teeth.
put your money where your chicken- lipped mouth is.  I will bet this mornings pay I am right.
I will take a piece of that bet. i say it does not come up five times each side.
well, a man with some gumption.  how much money you got?
nothing.
you want to make a kiddies bet?
I will bet my watch against your pay.
it is a movado.
never heard of it.  it is got no day or date.  hell, it am not even got numbers.  what is the matter?  you could not afford a timex?
next city you are in take it to a jeweler.  he will not give you less than four-hundred for it.
thirty-bucks?  that is it?
that is my morning's pay.
I am a rich man off of thirty bucks?
now that you are so well off, can i get you something, hon?
you got beer?
what would a truck stop be without beer?
let me have a beck's.
we am not got no beck's.
kirin?
no, we am not got no kirin.  we got miller.
genuine draft?
no.  we got miller.  regular miller. you want it, or do not you?
yeah, give me the miller.
hey, mister.  you gotta quarter?
what?
i wanna play a song on the juke. you got a quarter?
what happened to your hand?
accident, and yeah, i got to be more careful.
got any requests?
that country shit all sounds the same to me.
how about i pick one out for you?
you like patsy cline?  i just love her.  how come, i wonder, she do not put out no more new records.
she is dead.
gee, that is sad.  do not that make you sad?
I have had time to get over it.
you are not from around here, are you?  where you from?
oz.
you am not from oz.  oz is in that one movie.
you are too quick for me.
i asked you a question.
aw, toby, we were not doing nothing. we was just talking.
you shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table.  now, I am not going to ask you again, mister.  what were you doing with my girl?
i was not doing anything.
that is not the way it looked to me. looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
make time?  is everybody in this town slap happy?
honest, toby.  i just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.
stay out of this, jenny.  we got man's business to take care of.
look, pal, i was not making a play for your girl.
you expect me to believe that?
i do not care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
mister, I am calling you out.
what?  you want to fight?  over her?
you are fucked.
you know who i am?  toby n. tyler. my friends call me tnt. you know why?
they are not very imaginative?
'cause I am just like dynamite.  and when i go off somebody gets hurt.
fine.  i was making time with your girl.  now I am all scared, and I will never make that mistake again.  now go away.
not before i settle with you.
christ, i do not believe this.
stand up.
i was not hitting on your girl!
stand up, mister, or I will beat you where you sit.
what was that all about?
you know how that toby is.  thinks every man he sees is after his jenny.
more like jenny is after every man she sees.
you pay toby no mind.  he just likes to show off for his girl.  give him a couple of hours, he will cool off. still want that beer?
poor thing.  is she all right?
'cept that she lost her money and the sons of bitches stole her wedding ring.  that is when she started shooting.  can not blame her. the ring was all carlos left her when he died.
lord!  put the baby in the icebox. killed the poor thing.
baby did not die.  just froze off all it is finger and toes.  just a little fingerless, toeless boy now.  but the husband; he sees what the wife's done, so after he saves the baby he locks the wife in the refrigerator to see how she likes it.  now she died.
let me get your change.
flo, I am just going to help myself to a refill on the coffee.
ned!  now look at what you done! are you all right?
i think i burned my gun hand!
it would serve you right.  jose, run get a mop and clean this mess up.
shasta!  now why did you go and scare the nice man like that?  sorry about that, hon.  enjoy your beer, and try to have a nice day.
yeah, I will try.
good lord.  what happened to you?
just ran into a little trouble.
another accident?  you have really got to be more careful.  can i get you a drink?
no.
hungry?
no.
I am surprised to see you.  i thought you would be halfway to vegas by now.
i had a problem getting my car back.
you just seem to attract trouble, do not you?
nice office you have got.
i do all right.  real estate is not a bad game such as it is around here. the trick is to underestimate the price when you buy it, and overvalue when you sell.  you can turn a few dollars that way.
is not that illegal?
now what can i do for you?
i was hoping we could talk.
talk?  about what?
about things.  about your wife.
sweet grace?  what about her?
about what you said this morning.
you said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  fifty-thousand dollars.
i do.
you said you would cut that up with the man who did her in.
i did?
do not play simple with me, jake. you want me to spell it out for you? I will kill grace if you cut me in on the money.
i think this heat's getting to you the way you are rambling on.
I am not rambling.
you are talking like a mad man.
you are the one who brought it up. this morning.  in your car.
that was just loose talk.  i do not want anybody dead.
bullshit.  you wanted me to kill her.
a man does not always mean the things he says.
you meant it.
what makes you say that?
because i think you are a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
and what does that make you?
the slimy bastard who is going to do it for you.
let's say i do want her dead.  what is it you want?  this morning you were not a killer.
this morning i did not know how badly I would want to get out of this fucking town.
and for that you would kill grace?
for that I would kill a nun on easter sunday.
just to get out of here?  that does not seem much for a murder.
how do you put a price on murder?
i put it at fifty-thousand dollars, minus your cut, of course.  which is?
make it twenty.
twenty-thousand?  i do not have that kind of money.  i will not get the insurance until months after she is dead.  i do not imagine you will want to be around after poor grace's demise.  twenty-thousand; that is more money than i could ever get my hands on.
how much could you get?
maybe . . . ten-thousand.  and that is a maybe.
i need thirteen.
that is a bit much.
you are not buying a car, for christ sake.  you are having your wife killed.  I am the one who is neck is stuck out.  it is thirteen, or it is nothing.
you drive a hard bargain, but i had a feeling you were my boy when i met you.
I am not your boy, jake.  i do not like you, and i do not like what you are.  i got no choice but to do business with you.  this is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
do not say that.  i had a marriage of convenience with grace, and look where that is lead.  well, looks like we got ourselves a pact.
do we shake hands?
if you can not trust the man you have hired to kill your wife . . .?
i guess i might as well get this done with.
the sooner it is over, the sooner you are on your way.  now listen to me:  it is got to look like an accident; that is the thing.  if it doesn't, then it is no good.  i will not get a dime, and it is my neck that will be on the chopping block while you are living it up somewhere.
what should i do?
how the hell should i know?  I have never had a wife killed before.  i guess i should have hired a professional.
you want to do this yourself?  i do not have to do this, you know.
be quiet, boy.  I am thinking.  it can not be done at the house.  it should be . . .
this is what you do:  go to the house to see her.
and tell her what?
does not the heat bother you?
yeah, but i like the sun.  i grew up on a reservation.  the sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us.  jake's the same way.  he loves the desert.  i guess we are alike that way.  that is about the only way.
you love him?
no.
did you ever?
depends on what you call love.  when i was growing up i had nothing.  i learned to want everything.  i wanted more than sierra anyway. jake was my ticket.  he is not much; he is older than me, different than me, but he is got more money than half this town put together.  i courted him.  i let him think he was courtin' me, but i reeled him in like a fish on a line.  i wanted him.  i wanted what he could give me, and i would have done anything to get him.  is that love?
I am guessing no.
yeah, i guess you are right.
and i take it things did not much work out the way you planned.
I am still here, are not i?  see this?
all this nothing?  I have spent my life in this stinking desert.  it does not get to jake like it got to me.  he does not mind being out here. he does not mind being nothing but a land broker.  big fish in a small pond, he says.  more like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
you could just leave him.
i do not know how.
you just walk away.
it is not that easy.  maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  i can't.  i do not want to be alone.  i need to know I am going to be taken care of.
you need a meal ticket is what you mean.  some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here.
is that so bad?  it is not like i would not try to make him happy.  for awhile, anyway.  i mean, i would . . . do things for him.  i guess I am no good that way.  i guess i tried to sucker you along like that.  do you hate me for it?  i would not blame you if you did.  but maybe it is like you said:  you just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
whatever it takes.
how far is it to california?
from here?  i do not know.  far.  far enough.
have you ever been there before?
yeah.
is it pretty?
beautiful.  beautiful beaches.  blue water and clear skies as far as you can see.
take me with you.
i can't.
please.  i will not hang on you.  as soon as we get there you can dump me.  i do not care.  i just want to get out of here.
grace, i can't.  i can not even get out of here myself.  i need a hundred-fifty bucks to get my car back from that crazy mechanic.
i know where we could get the money. a lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
where?
jake.
you think jake's going to give me money just so i can take you out of here?
he does not give it to us.  we take it.
from?
he is got money.  in a floor safe in the living room.  I have never seen it, but he talks about it all the time.  more like brags.  he loves his money.  would not think of spending some of it on me.
you live pretty good.
yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
how much money has he got?
near as i can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
one-hundred-thousand!?  that son-of- a-bitch lied to me.
lied?  what do you mean?
i . . . nothing.  just something he said.  so if the money's in a safe we would have to get the combination--
it is not a combination lock.  it takes a key.  he keeps it on him all the time.  i mean all the time.  it scratches up against me when we do it.
if the key's on him, to get the key we would have to . . .
we would have to kill him.
john?  john where are you going?
i think this heat is making me crazy.  i was crazy to come back here, I am crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I would sure as hell be crazy if i spent another minute in this place.
john, please--
i do not know what i was thinking, but i can not do it.
what are you talking about?
kill someone.  i can not do it.
is it so bad?  it would be quick. he would not even have to feel it.
shit!
it is not like he is a young man. he is had time to live.
jesus christ!  listen to yourself! i can not do it, grace.  i can not do it.
you sure seen a lot for a blind man.
just 'cause i am not got eyes does not mean i can not see.
that a fact?
i can see just fine.  for example: you are a young man who thinks he is got someplace to be.
maybe i do.
or maybe you just think you do.  you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
i think I have heard that before.
what do you want for free?
you sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.
that is 'cause I have done a lot of living.
maybe one day I will get to sit on a corner and spout wise.
think you will live that long?
am not you got a little something for the infirm?
I am a little short. I will catch you next time.
i will not hold my breath.
i went to your place.  we talked, just like you told me.  we drove out into the desert . . .
is the job done?
no.
you did not kill her?
the time was not right.
you are out in the desert, the middle of nowhere with no one around for miles, and you say the time was not right?  what is the matter?  you were hoping to get it on home video?  a keepsake for the grandkids.  thank god i waited, or i never would have gotten it on tape.
you know what i mean.
i know all right.  i know you are just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  you have probably bagged a few at that. you would probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  from that you would just turn and walk away.  but to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  you can not wash that off. you would be a marked man for life. just like cain.  and you are a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. am not that right, boy?
you know so much about killing why do not you do it yourself?
i guess i have what you would call a love-hate relationship with grace.
you love her, but you hate her?
i hate loving her.  i hate the kind of her person she is.  i hate having to tolerate the little games she plays.  i hate letting her use me. but i love her too much to do otherwise.  and i certainly love her too much to kill her.  i could not stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull.  but you?  you got the killing in you, boy.
shut up.
came close this time and it scares you.
drop it, jake.
and next time, next time somebody is going to get dead.
shut up!
jake, how much were you going to pay me to do the job?
thirteen-thousand dollars.  had you done it.  is not that what we agreed on?
you think that is a lot of money?
all i have in the world.
that is what i like about you, jake. you are an honest man.
hey, mister.  mister.  i just. . . i just wanted to thank you.
for what?
for defending my honor this afternoon.
i hate to bust your bubble, but i was not defending you.
but you was going to fight for me.
i was not going to fight for you.  i was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
he is not my boyfriend.  i mean, i let him take me out and stuff, but i am not spoken for.  not yet that is.
get it through your head, little girl; I am not going for you.  if this toby likes you, then if i were you I would marry him.  you are not going to get much better in this town.
that is what i thought until you came riding in.  i saw your car over at the gas station.  it is cool.  want to take me for a ride?  desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
how old are you?
eighteen.  well, I am going to be eighteen in two years, but that do not mean you can not take me for a ride if you want.
no, i do not want to take you for a ride.  what i want is for . . . hey, you do not happen to have a hundred and fifty dollars i could--
mister!
oh, shit!
that is right, mister.  you better be afraid.  i told you it was not over, but you did not listen.  now i find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
i was not sneaking around with your girl.  would you please tell him?
you are too late, toby.  we are going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
what the hell are you talking about?
what is your name anyway?
oh, that tears it, mister.  I am going to bust you up but good.  I am going to bust you into a million pieces and then . . . and then bust those pieces up, and then . . . and then spread them all around.  that is what I am going to do.  you do not know what you are dealing with, mister.  I am crazy.  I am psycho crazy.
yeah, i know.  you are tnt.  just like dynamite.  when you go off somebody gets hurt.  all right.  let's do this.
toby tyler, it do not matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he is just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we going to run off, and I am going to have his love child.
will you shut up!
i want to stay.
i said come on!
kids.
yeah.  what are you going to do? that toby's a hot head.
he is at that.  no so much a fault of his own.  poor boy had quite a trauma as a child.
what happened?
his father worked in a strip mine north of here.  toby's school class went up to the mine one day.  school takes field trips up there every year.  big day for the kids when they can see ore tore up out of the ground.  anyway, on this particular day toby's dad up and falls into the machinery.
jesus!
yep.  tore him up good and spat out little, refined pieces of him. nothing like the embarrassment of having your father refined in front of your classmates to put the anger in a young man.
i guess.
like i said; you really can not blame the boy.  some people do not know how to avoid trouble.  know what i mean?
saw you at the truck stop this morning.  you are not from around here.
no, sir.  and I am not going to be around long if that is what you are worried about.
just curious.  that is a nasty cut you have got.
not as bad as it looks.
there was a young man over at jamilla's today when it got hit. way she tells it he got whacked around by one of the robbers.
would not know anything about it.
that is too bad.  i was hoping you were there.  maybe you could help us catch the guy who got away.  or maybe you could explain about all that money that got tore up when jamilla shot that biker.
wish i could help, sheriff.  but if you will excuse me I am going over to harlin's to pick up my car.  then I am getting the hell out of this place.
stay as long as you like, son.  no rush.
maybe not for you, sheriff, but i think I have had my fill of your little town.
hey there.  i was beginnin' to think you was not comin' back.  you do not look so good.
yeah, well, I have been around the bend a bit.
one of those days you feel like you been runnin' in circles and you am not no closer to where you tryin' to get than when you started?
you have been there?
hell, I have had days i would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  am not much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
you believe that?
you think bad, and bad is what you get.
that is a good piece of advice, darrell.
no charge.
listen, darrell, about that hundred- fifty bucks for the car, as soon as i get where I am going i swear i'll--
two-hundred.
what?
it is going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
you said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
yep.  for the hose.  but while you was gone i replaced a gasket. that is going to run you another fifty.
i did not tell you to replace any gasket.
yeah, but it was shot.
i did not tell you to do it!  you can not just do unauthorized work.
well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, do not you?  i can not do unauthorized work. i suppose i can just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  then you get in an accident and get killed.  or worse.  who they going to blame then?  they going to blame me, and there goes my reputation.
what reputation?  you are nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumble weed hick.
is that an insult?  are you insulting me.
listen you stupid fuck, i want my car.
take it.  as soon as i get my money. fifty dollars for an almost new gasket.  you do not know what kind of a deal you are getting.
I am taking my car, and I am taking it now!
you listen to me, you fancy city man.  you owe me money, and this car am not going nowheres until i get it. and if you take another five hours I will find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on her.  now get out of here!  you are stinking up my garage.
no!
what is the matter?  the fight gone out of you?  I am just going to smash a headlight.  maybe two.
please, just leave the car alone.
yeah, you better remember that.
goddamn you!  you son of a bitch!
there you go, sweet talking me again.
maybe not this time, but somebody is going to get dead around you.
no.
can i help you, sir?
i need a ticket.
where to?
out of here.
but, in particular?
i . . . mexico.  you got a bus that goes to mexico?  that is where i have to go.
where in mexico would you like--
i do not care, just get me there.
we have a bus to mexico.  arrives in two hours.  have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
how much.
one way, or round trip?
one way.
thirty even.
twenty-seven, fifty.  that is all i got.
the ticket is thirty dollars.
i bought a beer.  that was two- fifty.  i bought a beer, otherwise i would have thirty.
I am sorry, sir.  it is thirty dollars for the ticket.
yeah.  just a little short. figures.  i just wanted to get out, that is all.
please, you do not understand.  i have to get out of here.  they are going to come looking for me. they are going to kill me.  if i can not get this ticket then I am going to have to do things to get out of here.  i do not want to hurt anybody, i just want to leave.
I will give you the money!  okay? I will give you two-fifty.  just . . . just, please.
get up, mister!  do not ever let it be said toby tyler beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance.
what the hell are you doing?  are you crazy?
I am doing what any man would do if he would been offended.  I am beating you up.
you stupid punk!  you do not even know what you are fighting over!
my honor, that is what I am fighting over.  now get up off the ground, or do i have to whoop you where you lie?
toby!  toby tyler, leave him alone!
you stay away, jenny.  i aim to mess him up, and that am not a thing for a woman to see.
do not be afraid of him none.  i do not care what he does to you, we can still be together.
get away from me!
now, what is this?
give it to me!
mexico?  you are going to mexico?
I am leaving.  you never have to see me again.  just please, give me the ticket!
this means something to you?  jenny means something to me.
nooo!
I am going to beat you so bad you going to be eatin' nothing but soup the rest of your days.  rain dogs is going to be prettier than you when I am done. I am going to mess you up so bad you going to make your own momma sick.  I am going to . . .
i thought you would be on your way to vegas by now.  is there something you wanted?
i wanted to talk.
i do not think we have anything to talk about.
what about us?
there is no us, remember?
except i can not get you out of my head, grace.
I have thought about you every second since i left.  i can still taste you on my lips.
stop it.
why?  am i making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
because i know you are full of shit.
i mean it, grace.  I am getting out of here, and i want to take you with me.
i thought you could not leave.  i thought you could not get your car.
i could if i had jake's money.
is that what changed your mind?  the money?
i do not give a damn about the money. i want you, and i want to get us out of this shithole.  there is only one way to do that.
are you sure?  about me, i mean?
i came back for you; this morning i came back.  before i even knew about the money. you are what i want.
the only reason i stormed off is because you sort of spooked me talking about jake.  but I have had nothing but time to think about it. it keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. but we have got to get the money, baby.  we get the money, i get the car, then we get the hell out.
you said you could not kill anybody.
we do not have to kill him.  just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away.
grace . . . grace?
after dark.  I will leave the back door unlocked.
who was that on the phone?
wrong number.
you spent a long time talking for a wrong number.  but then you make friends so easily.  do not you, grace?
i put up new drapes, jake.
i know.  i was here when your apprentice was helping you. remember?
you never said anything.  about the drapes.
they look nice.
you have not even looked at them once.
they look nice.
i picked them out for you, jake.  i thought you would like the colors.
uh-huh
what the hell you looking at, girl?
nothing, jake.  absolutely nothing.
the day was not so bad.  we all got through it all right.
am not over yet.  night is part of day; separate, but equal.  night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
you are a hell of a pessimist, old man.
night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'.  it is when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you are afraid of.
you afraid of the dark?
afraid of it?  boy, i live in the dark.  people are afraid of what they can not see.  i can not see nuthin', so it is all the same to me. kiss from a beautiful woman, a lick from a dog.  the kiss of death. it is all the same.
you do not fear death?
we was born to die, boy.  from the minute you take your first breath you got a death sentence hanging over your head.  you just do not know where, or when, or how.  do not make sense worryin' about the particulars.
we are all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  is that it?
more or less.
not this twig, friend.  i got plans.
we all got plans.  i planned on seeing all my life.  i know you did not plan on straying into town.
no and i do not plan on sticking around either.  i do not guess I will be seeing you again.  take it easy.
same back at you.
any parting words of wisdom?
things am not always the way they seem. you got to ask yourself; is it worth it?
what is the matter?
you did not hear something?
how could i?  i was sleeping.
there is someone in the house.
i do not hear anything.  you were dreaming.  or maybe the wind blew something over.
the wind is not blowing.
jake, what is that?
what does it look like?
when did you buy a gun?
oh my god, jake, no.  if it is someone they will go away.  or call the police.  do not go out there.
what are you afraid of?  I am the one's got the gun.  stay here.
jake.  no.  no!
yeah, well, me too.
trouble with the car again?
you could say.  i do not even have it yet.
darrell giving you problems?
he did more work on the car.  he wants fifty bucks extra for it.
fifty dollars more.  that is a lot of money when you do not have a dime. and where did you plan on getting the money from?  maybe you thought you would pay your friend jake mckenna a visit.
it is not like that.
maybe you heard old jake's got some money stashed away and you thought you would help yourself to a little.
wait a minute.  just listen to me--
you thought you would come in here in the middle of the night and wham! wail off and clock old jake mckenna and turn his brains into wall paper.
jake--
and then with jake out of the way you could borrow two-hundred dollars.  or maybe two-thousand.  or twenty-thousand.  who is to stop you? not jake mckenna, 'cause old jake would be dead.
that is not the reason I am here.  i swear it.
there is another reason?  it better be good.
i came for grace.
you came to take my wife from me?
i came to kill her.
liar.
it is the truth, jake.
that is a thick change of heart.
yeah, well, a couple of hours ago i just about killed some guy over a girl.  not for money, for a girl. and she was just going to stand there and let it happen, or let him kill me.  same way grace played us this morning.  i do not like that, jake.  not twice in one day.  and maybe I am so pissed I would twist the next off my own grandma to get out of here.
that is a lot of talk.  a whole lot of talk.
damn it, jake.  if i do not get out of here some guys are going to come gunning for me.  and if it comes down to me or grace, then i pick grace.  you were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  give me two- hundred.  I will kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. but i need the money.  I have got to have the money.
I am curious about something.  I am wondering just how it is you happen to know where the bedroom's at.
wh . . . what are you talking about?
this morning when i came in on you and grace, you swore you had not so much as been near the bedroom.  now you make straight for it.
come on, jake--
do not jake me, boy!  it is a big house.  odd that you would know your way, except maybe you have been in the bedroom before.  maybe with grace to keep you company.
nothing happened with me and grace this morning.
then maybe this afternoon.  when i sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
christ, jake, please--
is that what happened?  did you even make it out to the desert, or did you just ply the afternoon between my sheets?
you are not talking sense.
sense?  if i had any sense i would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
what are you . . . you can not . . . you can not kill me.
a drifter, a loner, a trouble maker like you?  just passing through town, need money so he busts in on an, old man.  only this old man's got himself an automatic, and he knows how to use it.  a man's got to protect his home.  his wife.  you are dead, boy, and your own mother would not convict me.
what difference does it make if i slept with her.  you do not care about grace.
you are right.  i do not give a damn about her.  but to fuck a man's wife behind his back?  that just makes a fool out of him.  i do not like being made a fool of.
i do not blame you.  what man would? i admit it, okay?  i came back here and i made it with grace.  but if you kill me you are making a big mistake.
not from where i stand.
it is not me you have to worry about. it is her.  she wants you dead, jake. she wants you dead and she wants your money.
what are you babbling about?
think about it.  how do you think i got in here?  did you hear any glass break?  did you hear a door splinter?  how did the evening end? after you went to bed did she linger a bit?  maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  is that what happened?
you would tell me anything to save your pathetic life.
you know what kind of woman grace is.  you know how badly she wants to get the fuck out of sierra.  what makes you think when you were planning on killing her she was not doing the same for you?  what is she to you, jake; a woman who would have you dead?  let me kill her.  all i want is two-hundred dollars to get out of here with.
two-hundred dollars.
two-hundred dollars . . . that is how i put a price on murder.
why the hell did not you do anything?
what was i supposed to do?
you could have hit him, or kneed him in the balls.
where is the safe?
i do not know.
you do not know?  jesus christ! do not you think you should have found out before we killed him?
I am not sure where it is.  not exactly.  i never saw it.  i just heard him talk about it.
oh, that is great.  we killed jake because you heard him talk about some money that you have never seen. that is fucking brilliant!
do not yell at me!
nothing.  there is no safe under here.
there has to be!
there isn't!  there is nothing under here but more floor.  jesus fucking christ!  we killed a man for nothing but floor.
it is got to be here.  i heard him talk about it.  he bragged about it. six steps out, three left.
this is good.  this is real good. this is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us.  they will probably just lock us up for being idiots.
if it is not here, why would he wear that stupid key?
you are calling jake stupid?  you!?
do not yell at me!  i know it is here! i know it!
there is easily a hundred-thousand in there.  more than that.
i told you.  i knew it was there. did not i tell you?
if you want.
we are going all the way.  together.
let's go in the bedroom.
no.
let's do it here.
what about him?
let him watch.  i want him to know what he is missing.
you got a suitcase?
never needed one.  I have never been anywhere.  I have got a backpack.
get it, and put the money in it. pack up anything else you want to take with you.
where are you going?
to get my car.
wait.  what about . . . him?
put some clothes on him.  when i get back we will load him in the trunk and dump him in the desert.  it will takes days for anybody to find him.
what you want?
open up!
we are closed.  come back in the morning.
it is morning.
come back when the sun comes up.
what the hell . . . oh it is you. might have figured.  what do you want?
i want my car.
you got the money?
two-hundred dollars in hundred- dollar bills.  and this morning you was broke.
what is it to you?
i do not want no dirty money.  i run an honest business.
honest like al capone on tax day. where are my keys?
john!?  what the hell's the matter with you?
i . . . nothing.  i just stubbed my toe on a rock.  hurt like hell . . . that is all.
i got the money all packed.  i put the jeep in the garage.  figure that way people will think maybe me and jake went away.  might buy us some time.
yeah.  good thinking.
had push it in.  funny thing; it would not start.
funny thing.
nice night for a drive.  morning really.  i guess that is about the only way to keep cool; riding around with the top down on a fancy convertible in the first hours of the day.
not taking a drive, sheriff. heading out of town.
suppose you have had all you can of sierra.  what with that ruckus you had with toby.  oh yes, i heard all about that.
sheriff, he did not give me any choice.  if i had not defended myself- -
just cool down, son.  i am not accusing you of anything.  serves toby right to get his ass whooped. if you had not done it, somebody else would've.
is there a problem up the road, sheriff?
nope.  no problems up the road.
that yours, mrs. mckenna?
yes.  yes it is.
taking a little trip?
i had a fight with jake.  i . . . i just wanted to get away for awhile. mr. stewart was kind enough to take me as far as montrose.  I am going to take a bus to my sister's.  i thought I would stay with her for a few days.
is that right?  can not say as i blame you for wanting to head out for a bit.  i know I have had my fill of this town.  sixteen years I have been the law and order here.  so long i forgot why i ever wanted the job in the first place.  help people, i guess.  keep the peace.  problem is there is so much peace around here they do not much need me.  got a lot of speeders, but they are speeding through miles of nothing so i can not hardly blame them.  other than that, well, there am not much to steal.  i reckon that the last big crime we had was, what would you say mrs. mckenna?  a murder?
i . . .
why do not you step out of the car, son?
i do not understand what the--
just step from the car.  nice and slow.
sure, sheriff.
now step around to the back of the car and open the trunk for me.
what for?
i think you might just want to do as i say.
there is nothing in the trunk, sheriff.
and as soon as i see that you are on your way.
john . . .?
grace!  just . . . let me handle this.  sheriff, I am telling you there is nothing in that trunk.  if that is not good enough for you, then I would be happy to open it.  just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
i could do that.  'course we would have to go back into town.  there would be a whole crowd of people around when the trunk was opened.  a whole crowd of witnesses.  that would not be too pretty, now would it?
john . . .
is that the way you want it, boy?  a bullet in the head in the middle of the desert?  ends like this and you will not be able to spend a dime of that blood money.
he killed him, sheriff!  i could not stop him!  he made me come with him. he told me if i said a word he would kill me too.
you bitch!  you were in on it froom the start!
shut up!  the both of you.  am not neither one of you too smart. especially you, boy.  do not you think i had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  you smell like trouble.  stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
i did not do anything.
killing jake mckenna's got to amount to something.  he was not much of a man, but that do not give you the right to murder him.  and do not tell me you didn't, 'cause i know you did.  i was there.  like i said; i been watching you.
sheriff potter, please.  i can not go to jail.  i wanted no part of it.
you liar!  you wanted him dead.  you seduced me into killing him!
for the love of god would you two give it a rest?  lord almighty.  in all my years i have never seen anything so pathetic.  how far did you think you were going to get with this?  neither one of you can wait to slit the others throat.  now use what little smarts you got.  if i was going to bust you i would not have waited until after you killed jake.
what do you want?
same thing you want.  i want to be out of sierra; to be able to do as i please.  but that takes money.
that is what this is all about?  a shakedown?  you picked the wrong people.  we do not have any money.
sure you do.  everybody in town knows about the money jake kept hid in the house.  it is a wonder the mrs. here just now got round to killing him.  not for lack of trying.
what did you think, boy?  that you were the first man to drift through this town she came on to?  not by a long shot.  you are just the most gullible.  how much did you get?
thirty-thousand dollars.
you am not passing these test, son. if i can not trust you I am going to have to arrest you . . .
. . .at the very least.  i know there was more than thirty-thousand dollars.  now, how much did you get?
do not tell him anything.  he can not do this.
can not i?  you are out in the desert, all alone, with a body in your trunk.  what do you think, boy?
one-hundred-thousand dollars.  a little more.
damn you!  what did you do that for? he can not prove anything.
no, you just wanted me to keep my mouth shut so i could go to a hanging alone.
nobody's going to hang.  we are all going to walk away with a little something.  i am not a greedy man. and, hell, you did all the work. one-hundred-thousand dollars.  split that three ways and it comes out to about thirty-three thousand.  give or take.
and you are taking?
that is all talk.  he is got nothing on us.  he let you kill jake.
not me.  us.
it does not matter.  he was there and he let it happen.  he can not take us in.
give him the money.
what?
you heard me.  count it out.
he can not prove anything, john.  he can not turn us in.
he can kill us.  i do not know about you, but my life is worth thirty- thousand dollars.
there you go, mrs. mckenna.  just put it in there.
john--
that was not so bad.  what is thirty- some-thousand to rich folks like you?  it did not hurt a bit.
sheriff potter.
i shot him.
you killed him!
he was going to take the money.
thirty-thousand, that is all.  we would have been free and clear.  you did not have to kill him.
it is our money.  he had no right to take it.
you are crazy, you know that!? you are fucked up!?
just drive.
jesus, grace.  did you have to kill him?
he was going to--
i know.  he was to take the fucking money.
you are tense.  what are you all uptight about?
you killed a man for no reason!
is that the kind of girl you think i am?  what can i do to make you relax?
you could give me the gun.
well, nothing.
now what?
now we dump jake, split the money, then you are on your own.
but you said we could be together.
are you kidding?  I am not going down with you for killing a cop.
what difference does it make?  you killed jake.
we killed jake.  and it is a big difference.  you kill an old man, that is one thing.  nobody cares about an old man.  you kill a cop and they never stop looking for you. never.
he was a crooked bastard.  he would have killed us.
the police do not know that.  and it is going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I will take you as far as california.  if we can even make that.  after that I am cutting you loose.
but i want to say with you,
why?  so when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  you take your hald of the money and run.  you might want to try mexico.  with all that dough you will live like a queen.
i do not want to go to mexico, john. i want to be with you.  do not you think i care about you?
i think you are a lying, back stabbing bitch.  but it is nice to know you care.
john!
grace!
are you all right?
i think i busted my leg.
can you climb back up.
i can not make it.  grace?  grace!?
I am here.
grace, listen to me.  in the trunk of my car is a rope.  it should reach down here.  got get it, throw it down and I will climb up.
I will get it.
john!  can you hear me?  are you still there?
where the hell am i going to go?
john, you have to throw the keys up to me.
john, throw me the keys.
what for?
the trunk.  it is locked.
it is not locked.  i left it open when i took out jake's body.
it is . . . it is locked.
you closed it, did not you, grace?
i was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
bullshit, grace.  you were going to drive off and leave me here.
no.  i swear it.
and you are not one to lie, are you?
throw me the keys and I will pull you up.
why do not you come down and get them so i can wring your pretty little neck?
john, if you do not throw me the keys, then I will just walk away. walk away and leave you here.
walk to where?  we are fifty miles to the nearest town.  it is going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  how far do you think you are going to get?
someone will find me.
yeah, they will find you.  dried up and twice dead.
you idiot!  you will kill us both!
at least I will have company when i die.  am not that right, jake?
for christ's sake, john!  throw me the keys!
what do you say, jake?  should we trust her?  no?  i did not think so.
fuck you!  do you hear me, john!? fuck you!  john . . . john!?
