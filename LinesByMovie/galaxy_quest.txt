structural damage at 68 percent.
we're getting major structural damage.
where the hell is he?  an hour and a half late.  an hour and a half!
this is great!  they're going to start eating each other out there.
he's a twit!
oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
you're kidding. when for?
tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
he's a miserable twit!
the guy is terminally selfish!
oh alex, get away from that thing...
dear god.... how did i come to this?
not again...
i played richard iii...
settle down, alex...
no. i can't go out there! i won't say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. i won't.  i can't!
you said we do appearances together, or not at all.'
i didn't say that.  i said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." that's what i said.
unbelievable.
you are so full of shit
a few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  i come in for an hour at most. it's a nothing.
how much of a nothing? not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
what do you want me to say, gwen?... they wanted the commander.
alex you can't -just leave.
oh can't i? watch me!
come on, old friend...
friend. you stole all my best lines.  you cut me out of episode two entirely!..
you will go out there.
i won't and nothing you say-
"the show must go on."
...damn you!  damn you!
hi everybody.
hey. thanks for one nice intro... uh.
guy... you probably don't remember me do you?   i was on the show in '82.  episode 31?  got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial?  "crewman #6?"
listen, i was wondering, would you guys mind if i sit in today? see if anybody's interested in an autograph? never know.
sure, guy, if you can stand the excitement.
how do you remember this stuff?
oh i make it up. use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
you gotta admit, they do love him.
almost as much as he loves himself.
i'm glad you asked... to me the most important qualities of a galaxy explorer are loyalty...
... to camera center no matter whose shot you're blocking...
leadership....
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
and determination.
commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and i are having. in "the quasar dilemma", the sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
excuse me guys.
what?
you smiled at me.
commander, i must speak to you. it is a matter of supreme importance... we are thermians from the klatu nebula, and we require your help. i beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. a great many lives hang in the balance...
right, if this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure i have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a toyota the last time i did one of these
i... certainly, but-
catch me later, okay?
commander, as i was saying... in "the quasar dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for gamma override. but online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
it's a television show. okay? that's all. it's just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
yes but, we were wondering-
there is no quantum flux and there is no auxiliary... there's no goddamn ship  do you get it?
oh good, there's nothing to eat.
why didn't you stop at the market?
i still haven't got this bloody thing off.
you could order something in.
a boy comes to the door.
i don't know... it just wasn't like him.
yes, poor jason. as we speak he's probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on. while here i sit eating christmas cheese in spring.
sir, i understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, i beg you to hear our plea. we are thermians from the klatu nebula.  our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by roth'h'ar sarris of fatu-krey. sarris wants the omega 13. we are to meet in negotiation. however our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. the flames, the death...  please captain, you are our last hope.  we have secured a limousine.
oh, right! the thing with the thing. come on in, i'll get some pants on.
commander... welcome to the protector ii.  would you like to don your uniform?
mind if we skip that?  i have to get back pretty quick for this thing in van nuys.
as you wish.
first, i require the omega 13... second-
okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. fire red particle cannons full. fire gannet magnets left and right. fire pulse catapults from all chutes. and throw this thing at him too, killer.
commander?... where are you... going?
home.
you... you mean earth?
yeah. "earth." time to get back to "earth," kids.
but commander... the negotiation... you... you... you fired on him.
right. long live... what's your planet?
theramin.
long live theramini.  take a left here?
but what if sarris survives?
oh, i don't think so. i gave him both barrels.
he has a very powerful ship. perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
i would but i am really running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  but listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
an interstellar vox.
thanks
how can we thank you, commander. you- you have saved our people.
it was a lot of fun. you kids are great.
he dissed us again, brandon!
he probably... has some very important business to attend to...
god, what an ass.
come in protector... protector...
that's it, it's go time.
don't do it, tommy. he's not worth it.
this isn't mine. wait, where is that kid?...
you know it's one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
you should have let me hit him.
i don't know guys... i mean, he almost looked... sincere. i know, it's bizarre!
that's right... just keep shaking it out... here, have some gum, it helps.
wh... where are we?
twenty third quadrant of gamma sector.  i can show you on a map.
"crewman #6"... call me guy.
you... know us?
that's why you built this ship?
it's ... incredible.
oh my god, it's real.
all this from watching the.. historical records?
what the hell is going on?!!?
jason, what have you gotten us into?
calm down everybody.   we're just here to negotiate general sarris' surrender.
"just!?"
weapons storage...
it's perfectly safe. i promise.
... maintenance facility...
at ease men.
like throwing gasoline on a fire...
u.... what do you think?
that possibly... the valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
... what does that mean?
what does that mean?!!!  yes, i see! yes... it means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
covalent... right. so...
so our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - a two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
ok!
dr. lazarus... i hope that i'm not breaching protocol but.. i am so very humbled to stand in your presence... i have studied your missions extensively... though i am thermian, i have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the mak'tar.
well good, that's very... nice.
by grabthar's hammer, dr. lazarus, i-
don't do that. i'm not kidding.
i'm sorry, sir, i was only-
just don't.
...yes sir.  your quarters sir.
this is it?
yes sir. marvelous, isn't it? completely distractionless.
where's my bed?
just as on your home planet, sir. if i may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now i sleep with a peace i never thought possible...
is that the bathroom?
yes sir... the use of your waste facilities were strangely absent from the historical records, so we had to extrapolate purely on the basis of your anatomy.
it's jason...
one minute   i'm -  hey, i'm dressing.'
oh come on, it's not like i haven't-
i just can't believe it. any of it!  look at this room!.. they designed it based on the tuaran pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  computer?
yes?
what's the weather like outside?
there is no weather in space.
i never get tired of that joke.
let me try.  computer?  computer?...
only answers to me.
but i'm the commander!
on the show i talk to the computer and repeat what it says. so that's what they built.
c'mon, we're wanted up on the command deck.
wait. when are you going to tell them?
tell them? about...
who we are. don't you think they're going to be pissed?
are you kidding? i'm not going to tell them.
well you have to tell them.  what if something happens? we're actors, not astronauts... we can't do this stuff!
it's not the stuff. i mean, anybody can learn the stuff...  the important thing is commitmnt. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
ninty-nine percent of acting is commitment. acting.  stella adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught acting...
hey... hey where are you going?
we have no right to do this. they deserve to know.
gwen... gwen, c'mon, wait, no!
what's going on?
i think we're going to exit the space port.
excuse me?
they designed the ship from watching you. so... take her out, lieutenant...
more to the left... stay parallel...
hey, you want to drive?
to our brave guests.  few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  we are blessed to count ourselves among them.
wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we'll be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. never give up, never surrender!
the omega 13... why does that sound so familiar?...
the lost footage. at the convention. the mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
well, it's... this was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  we don't know what it does either.
why don't you just turn it on and see?
mathesar?. .. has sarris seen the.. historical records?
no, thank god he has not.
then how did he find out about the device?
our former commander was not... strong.
former commander?
i'm sorry. you deserve to be shown.
we're leaving, jason. we're leaving now.
let me think. i need time to think.
he wants to think!?
no, jason, that's a wrap!  there's nothing to think about!
commander...
mathesar, i need you to prepare pods for my crew.
there's nobody here. jason...
mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
yes... hi sarris... how are you doing?
better than my lieutenant.  he failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as i'd hoped on our last encounter.
right.  well... listen, i'm  i'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. it was kind of a misunderstanding.  i'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... how's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? god, i hope so, i feel just awful about that.
deliver the device now or i will destroy your ship.
listen, i'd like to, but frankly.. i'm not even sure where it is, or even...
you have ten seconds.
all right. you got it. you win. i'll deliver it now.  just give me a moment to set it up.
all right, now nobody panic, i've dealt with this guy before and believe me, he's as stupid as he is ugly.
jason..
we're going to fire everything we've got at him, all right?
jason...
you just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay?
...okay
all right. put me back on with him.
i made the cut the line gesture. you nodded okay.'
i thought it was the "we're dead" gesture! i was agreeing! like i know where the hold button is???
listen, sarris, you can't blame me for trying...
where?
just go! go! dammit punch go!
the ship is sustaining structural damage.
guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
faster tommy. get us out of here!
it's as far as it goes!
they're still behind us...
we should have a turbo. i'm always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
could be this.
push it. hold it down.
the enemy is matching velocity.
the enemy is matching velocity.
we heard it the first time!
shit! i'm doing it! i'm repeating the damn computer!
we've got to stop!
we stop we die. keep holding the thruster down tommy!
you don't hold a thruster down! it's for quick boosts
like you know?
maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
i don't think that's a cloud...
mathesar? what is that?
it's the tothian mine field left standing from the great war of 12185.
may i get the check?
the ships are gaining...
do your best, tommy...
oh god...
could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
they're drifting toward me... i think they're magnetic!...
continue forward, sir?
patience, lt. . patience.
we've have to stop!
front armor is gone! just slow it down a little!
no!  we're almost through!
don't be insane, stop! full stop!
keep going! keep going!
what's happened?
the engines are dead. we're drifting.
are they behind us?
no, i don't think so... wait. they're not but...  something is.  oh my god.
"go into the cloud! ...
alex? where are you going?
to see if there's a pub.
computer, what about our engines? why don't we have power?
the beryllium sphere has fractured under stress.
it's fractured...
can it be repaired?
computer, can it be repaired?
negative. the beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
we need another one.
do we have a replacement beryllium sphere onboard?
computer, do we have a replacement beryllium sphere onboard?
negative, no reserve beryllium sphere exists onboard.
no, we don't have an extra beryllium sphere.
you know, that's really getting annoying.
i have one job on this lousy ship. it's stupid, but i'm going to do it. got it?
sure, no problem.
a thousand apologies. we have failed you.
you what?.. what are you talking about?
we have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. the fault must lie with us, with the ship...
"deception..." "lies."
well... sort of...
we have become aware of these concepts only recently. in our dealings with sarris. often sarris will say one thing, and do another. promise us mercy and deliver destruction... it is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  but if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with sarris.
hey commander. listen, we found some beryllium on a nearby planet. we might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. what do you think?
i...well, uh... yes, absolutely.
dr. lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  i have programed it to the coordinates of a beryllium sphere of sufficient density.
thanks.
good luck on your mission, sir. by grabthar's hammer, by the suns of warvan i wish you-
uh uh! what did we talk about?
right... sorry, sir.
guy, you're not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
oh, i'm not? i'm not? then what's my last name?
your last name.
yeah, what is it?
it's... i don't know.
no. nobody does. do you know why? because my character isn't important enough for a last name. because i'm going to die five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
guy, you have a last name. we just don't know it.
do i? do i?  for all you know i'm just "crewman #6"!  okay, it's fleegman! guy fleegman! there! now i'm a whole person! i can't die! fleegman! they can't kill me now, can they? can they?
you were holding it upside down weren't you?
shut up.
you know, with the makeup and everything1 i actually thought he was smart for a second.
you think you could do better "laredo?"
hey, watch that "laredo" shit.
we're screwed... we're so screwed...
all right, let's all settle down.  if we're going to get through this we're going to have to exercise self control.
self control?  that's funny coming from the guy that slept with every moon princess and terrakian slave girl on the show!...
did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
i could have held on to you! ...
about this much.
what's the scale?  is that ten miles? a hundred miles?
this much.
you're playing your good side.
don't be ridiculous.
and note the sucked in gut.
...sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
that's it, that's what's going to kill me.
let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
there it is. the beryllium sphere.
must be some sort of mining facility.
where are the miners?
something bad happened here.
look at that... will you look at that... they look like little children...
could they be the miners?
you okay, alex?
i don't like this... i don't like this at all...
oh, they're so cute.
of course they're cute now. but in a second they're going to turn mean and ugly somehow and then there are going to be a million more of them!...
i am so sick of being right.
let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
all right... here's the plan:  first, fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then gwen, alex, fred and i go down to get the sphere.  any of those things come back, give a signal. guy, you set up a perimeter.
why does this sound so familiar?
"assault on voltareck iii."  episode... 31 i think.
we're doing episode 31?
whatever, the one with the hologram. the wall of fire.
how the hell is fred supposed to project a hologram?
we're doing episode 31, jason?
it doesn't have to be a hologram... just a diversion.
jason, are we doing episode 31 or not?
it's a rough plan, guy! what does it matter if we're doing episode 31 or not?!
because i died in episode 31!
this is ludicrous.  why are you listening to this man?  must i remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  he's no more equipped to lead us than this fellow.  no offense.
you have a better plan, alex?
as a matter of fact, i do. look at their eyes. they're obviously nocturnal. come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt. so our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31.'
a hologram...
never mind, fred....
no, no... i'll think on it...
they're gone.
where'd they go? back inside?
i don't know.
nobody was watching?
all right, gwen, alex, fred, follow me.  guy, set up the perimeter. tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
what kind of signal?
anything.
okay, i'll do this...  "caw caw!"
tommy, we have these...
oh, right, sorry.
okay, let's go.
you have no idea what a perimeter is, do you?
not a clue. you?
i think he just likes pointing at things.
how does the rolling help, actually?
it helps.
those blue things ate everybody here?
it doesn't make sense... surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
clenched jaw...
will you stop riding me?!
sorry guys... it just went off.
good work, tommy.  let's go!
go ahead!
you go first! there's no time!
oh, of course, i forgot! you have to be the hero, don't you?... heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once! oh no, jason nesmith couldn't possibly-
oh my god! tommy! stop the pod! stop the pod!
i can't...  it's on autopilot!...
he knocked me out the sonofabitch. where is he?
down there.
we got the sphere but the commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  teb, reset the pod, we're going back.
that thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  face it, he's dead.
wait, fred, what about your thing, you know... "digitize me, sergeant chen!"
...the digital conveyor.
of course... we'll just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
you said "the commander.
what?
back there. you said "the commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
no i didn't.
yes you did.
i heard it too.
is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
jason.. can you hear me?
yes. yes, i'm here!
thank god. are you okay?
yeah. but i've got gorignak staring me in the face. i think i can take it though...
jason, we're going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
the digital conveyer?  you mean i'm going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
right.
i'll take my chances with gorignak.
what?  what did he say?
nothing. hold please.
okay... on what?
how about the pig-lizard?
hey i was doing okay with the pig lizard.
what?  what?
nothing.
i heard something. a squeal.
wait, the pig lizard is gone. why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
turn on the translation circuit.
jason?...  i don't think the pig lizard was gorignak...
what the hell are you talking about?
fred's no good, jason. you're going to have to kill it
kill it? well i'm open to ideas!...
go for the eyes. like in episode 22 with-
it doesn't have eyes.
the throat, the mouth... its vulnerable spots.
it's a rock. it doesn't have vulnerable spots!
i know...  you contruct a weapon.  look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
a lathe??? get off the line, guy.'
alexander??? please? you're my advisor, advise me!
... . well  you have to figure out what it wants... what's its motivation?
it's a damn rock monster!!! it doesn't have motivation!
that's your problem.  you were never serious about the caraft...  "i'm a rock... i just want to be a rock... still. peaceful.. tranquil.." ..."oh, but what's this?  something's making noise... no, not noise, no... movement.  vibrations.  make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... i must crush the thing that makes the vibrations..."
am i crazy, or do you actually have something there?
no, i'll kill you. .
listen fred. you did this for four years on the show. you can do it now... put your hands on the controls..
fred, i worked summer stock with hopkins. regional theater with hoffman. but i swear to god i have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a freddy kwan. you're mr. dependable... you can do this.
you worked with hopkins? i worship hopkins.
as good as hopkins?
hopkins can't drink your bathwater fred.
no no no.
we've got to get out of here.  c'mon, hurry
yes.
then tell me one thing... what does it do, the device? the omega 13.
i don't know.
is it a bomb?  a booby trap?  tell me!
stop, please! i don't know!
prepare a tear harness for the female...
no! i swear i don't know! please!
do you think i'm a fool? that the commander does not know every bolt, every weld of his ship?
wait. what did you say?
please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. i'm not the commander, i don't know anything.
explain -
gwen. the show. there's no choice. do it.
my name is jason nesmith. i'm an actor. we're all actors.
our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. they have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
we pretend...
simpler.
we.. we lie.
yes... you understand that, don't you, mathesar?...
i'm not a commander, there is no national space exploration administration. there is no snip.
but there it is!...
a model, only as big as this.
but... inside, i have seen-
sections of rooms made of plywood. our beryllium sphere was painted wire and plaster. the digital conveyor was christmas lights... decorations.  it's all a fake.  i'm not him...  i'm a nothing. a nobody.
but...why?
it's difficult to... on our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.
lieutenant lathe, i confess i am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. chasing across the universe to obtain what is, i am now certain, a bauble of fiction. tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? i would like nothing to remain.
the core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the commander.' you've murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
shut up.' just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
"purple skinned monstrosity...?"
i was staying in character.  "egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
sense memory. i see you got to win the fight...
i had the shot...
all right guys... uh... gwen and i are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. fred, you and guy need to get that air valve back on.  alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case fred and guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
jason? what about me? what do i do?
practice driving, tommy.
so... we get to shut down the neutron reactor?
right.
uh... i hate to break it to you jason, but i don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a learning annex course i don't know about, i'm pretty sure you don't know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
no i don't. but i know somebody who does.
... yes?
we accidently traded vox units when we bumped into each other on saturday.
oh... oh, i see. oh.
what's  your name, son?
brandon.
brandon, i remember you from the convention, right?... you had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and i spoke sharply to you...
yes, i know, and i want you to know i thought about what you said... i know you meant it constructively but...
it's okay. listen-
... but i want you to know that i am not a complete braincase, okay? i understand completely that it's just a tv show. there is no ship, there is no beryllium sphere, no diagital conveyor... i mean, obviously it's all just a-
it's real, brandon. all of it, it's real.
i knew it!... i knew it!...
brandon.. . the crew and i are in trouble and we need your help.
sir, it's you  thank ipthar!
quellek. what are you doing in there?
i avoided capture using the mak'tar stealth haze.  where is everyone?
come with me. i'll explain on the way.
there's no hatch.  there's no hatch!
wait... jason, here!...
okay, we got it.
okay, you can go on in... i'm going to get kyle. he knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
hi brandon.
no time for pleasantries, kyle. we have a level five emergency. the commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
oh.  okay.
you've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
i have sectors 1-28.  i think hector has the upper levels.
we'd better get everybody online.  and kyle, stop downloading porn.  your frame rate is unacceptable.
okay, now left at the next turn... past the oxygen units.  make a right there. then go through the antimatter vent...
okay...  okay, now what.
now make a right, you'll see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility.  the bowels of the ship.
commander, do you have a camera?  i'd die to see this in person... all they showed on t,v was a machine here, and a wall here... i don't know why they didn't show the whole thing.
we'd never have the budget for this.
okay, so do you see a door marked "core unit?" should be down at the far end to your left.
yes...?
okay, that's where you want to be.
we've got to get that valve turned off. their oxygen is almost gone...
listen, i'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
it's suicide.
i'm just a glorified extra, fred.  i'm a dead man anyway. if i'm going to die, i'd rather go out a hero than a coward.
maybe you're the plucky comic relief, you ever think of that?
find them.
but sir, my men. the core implosion is not reversible...
find them.
brandon.. just in case i die, there's something i have to know...
yes commander?
what does the omega 13 do?
well, that's the big question, isn't it?
what do you mean?
it's been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
but you don't?
no,  i am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter rearranger, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
how did you come to that conclusion?
my cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. his favorite movie is the omegaman.  he's seen it 13 times...
brandon!	time to go!
yes commander... all right, you're almost there. just go through the chompers and over the pit.
