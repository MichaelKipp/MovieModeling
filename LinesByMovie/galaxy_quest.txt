structural damage at 68 percent.
we are getting major structural damage.
where the hell is he?  an hour and a half late.  an hour and a half!
this is great!  they are going to start eating each other out there.
he is a twit!
oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
you are kidding. when for?
tomorrow morning, before the store opening.
he is a miserable twit!
the guy is terminally selfish!
oh alex, get away from that thing...
dear god.... how did i come to this?
not again...
i played richard iii...
settle down, alex...
no. i can not go out there! i will not say that ridiculous catch phrase one more time. i won't.  i can't!
you said we do appearances together, or not at all.'
i did not say that.  i said "wouldn't it be great if we could always, work together." that is what i said.
unbelievable.
you are so full of shit
a few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  i come in for an hour at most. it is a nothing.
how much of a nothing? not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
what do you want me to say, gwen?... they wanted the commander.
alex you can not -just leave.
oh can not i? watch me!
come on, old friend...
friend. you stole all my best lines.  you cut me out of episode two entirely!..
you will go out there.
i will not and nothing you say-
"the show must go on."
...damn you!  damn you!
hi everybody.
hey. thanks for one nice intro... uh.
guy... you probably do not remember me do you?   i was on the show in '82.  episode 31?  got killed by the lava monster before the first commercial?  "crewman #6?"
listen, i was wondering, would you guys mind if i sit in today? see if anybody's interested in an autograph? never know.
sure, guy, if you can stand the excitement.
how do you remember this stuff?
oh i make it up. use lots of "k"s and "v"s.
you gotta admit, they do love him.
almost as much as he loves himself.
I am glad you asked... to me the most important qualities of a galaxy explorer are loyalty...
... to camera center no matter whose shot you are blocking...
leadership....
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
and determination.
commander, please settle a dispute that my crew and i are having. in "the quasar dilemma", the sentient had taken control of the ship's guidance systems, however-
excuse me guys.
what?
you smiled at me.
commander, i must speak to you. it is a matter of supreme importance... we are thermians from the klatu nebula, and we require your help. i beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. a great many lives hang in the balance...
right, if this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure i have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a toyota the last time i did one of these
i... certainly, but-
catch me later, okay?
commander, as i was saying... in "the quasar dilemma", you used the auxiliary of deck b for gamma override. but online blueprints indicate deck b is independent of the guidance matrix, so we were wondering where the error lies?
it is a television show. okay? that is all. it is just a bunch of fake sets, and wooden props, do you understand?
yes but, we were wondering-
there is no quantum flux and there is no auxiliary... there is no goddamn ship  do you get it?
oh good, there is nothing to eat.
why did not you stop at the market?
i still have not got this bloody thing off.
you could order something in.
a boy comes to the door.
i do not know... it just was not like him.
yes, poor jason. as we speak he is probably out somewhere talking rubbish to a roomful of hangers-on. while here i sit eating christmas cheese in spring.
sir, i understand this is a terrible breach of protocol, but please, i beg you to hear our plea. we are thermians from the klatu nebula.  our people are being systematically hunted and slaughtered by roth'h'ar sarris of fatu-krey. sarris wants the omega 13. we are to meet in negotiation. however our past efforts in this regard have been nothing short of disastrous. the flames, the death...  please captain, you are our last hope.  we have secured a limousine.
oh, right! the thing with the thing. come on in, I will get some pants on.
commander... welcome to the protector ii.  would you like to don your uniform?
mind if we skip that?  i have to get back pretty quick for this thing in van nuys.
as you wish.
first, i require the omega 13... second-
okey dokey, let's fire blue particle cannons full. fire red particle cannons full. fire gannet magnets left and right. fire pulse catapults from all chutes. and throw this thing at him too, killer.
commander?... where are you... going?
home.
you... you mean earth?
yeah. "earth." time to get back to "earth," kids.
but commander... the negotiation... you... you... you fired on him.
right. long live... what is your planet?
theramin.
long live theramini.  take a left here?
but what if sarris survives?
oh, i do not think so. i gave him both barrels.
he has a very powerful ship. perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
i would but i am really running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  but listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
an interstellar vox.
thanks
how can we thank you, commander. you- you have saved our people.
it was a lot of fun. you kids are great.
he dissed us again, brandon!
he probably... has some very important business to attend to...
god, what an ass.
come in protector... protector...
that is it, it is go time.
do not do it, tommy. he is not worth it.
this is not mine. wait, where is that kid?...
you know it is one thing to treat us this way, but how can you do this to your fans?...
you should have let me hit him.
i do not know guys... i mean, he almost looked... sincere. i know, it is bizarre!
that is right... just keep shaking it out... here, have some gum, it helps.
wh... where are we?
twenty third quadrant of gamma sector.  i can show you on a map.
"crewman #6"... call me guy.
you... know us?
that is why you built this ship?
it is ... incredible.
oh my god, it is real.
all this from watching the.. historical records?
what the hell is going on?!!?
jason, what have you gotten us into?
calm down everybody.   we are just here to negotiate general sarris' surrender.
"just!?"
weapons storage...
it is perfectly safe. i promise.
... maintenance facility...
at ease men.
like throwing gasoline on a fire...
u.... what do you think?
that possibly... the valence bonds have shifted bi-laterally?
... what does that mean?
what does that mean?!!!  yes, i see! yes... it means that perhaps... the... bonding molecules have become covalent?!...
covalent... right. so...
so our solution is to introduce a bonding substrate! - a two molecule compound sharing a free electron - and bombard the ions with their reflective isotopes!
ok!
dr. lazarus... i hope that I am not breaching protocol but.. i am so very humbled to stand in your presence... i have studied your missions extensively... though i am thermian, i have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the mak'tar.
well good, that is very... nice.
by grabthar's hammer, dr. lazarus, i-
do not do that. I am not kidding.
I am sorry, sir, i was only-
just don't.
...yes sir.  your quarters sir.
this is it?
yes sir. marvelous, is not it? completely distractionless.
where is my bed?
just as on your home planet, sir. if i may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now i sleep with a peace i never thought possible...
is that the bathroom?
yes sir... the use of your waste facilities were strangely absent from the historical records, so we had to extrapolate purely on the basis of your anatomy.
it is jason...
one minute   I am -  hey, I am dressing.'
oh come on, it is not like i haven't-
i just can not believe it. any of it!  look at this room!.. they designed it based on the tuaran pleasure ship from "historical document" thirty seven.  oh and wait, wait, listen to this!  computer?
yes?
what is the weather like outside?
there is no weather in space.
i never get tired of that joke.
let me try.  computer?  computer?...
only answers to me.
but I am the commander!
on the show i talk to the computer and repeat what it says. so that is what they built.
c'mon, we are wanted up on the command deck.
wait. when are you going to tell them?
tell them? about...
who we are. do not you think they are going to be pissed?
are you kidding? I am not going to tell them.
well you have to tell them.  what if something happens? we are actors, not astronauts... we can not do this stuff!
it is not the stuff. i mean, anybody can learn the stuff...  the important thing is commitmnt. 99% of anything is just committing to it.
ninty-nine percent of acting is commitment. acting.  stella adler never manned a resonance cannon, she taught acting...
hey... hey where are you going?
we have no right to do this. they deserve to know.
gwen... gwen, c'mon, wait, no!
what is going on?
i think we are going to exit the space port.
excuse me?
they designed the ship from watching you. so... take her out, lieutenant...
more to the left... stay parallel...
hey, you want to drive?
to our brave guests.  few in this universe have the opportunity to meet their heroes.  we are blessed to count ourselves among them.
wherever a distress signal sounds among the stars, we will be there, this fine ship, this fine crew. never give up, never surrender!
the omega 13... why does that sound so familiar?...
the lost footage. at the convention. the mysterious device in our last episo--historical document.
well, it's... this was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  we do not know what it does either.
why do not you just turn it on and see?
mathesar?. .. has sarris seen the.. historical records?
no, thank god he has not.
then how did he find out about the device?
our former commander was not... strong.
former commander?
I am sorry. you deserve to be shown.
we are leaving, jason. we are leaving now.
let me think. i need time to think.
he wants to think!?
no, jason, that is a wrap!  there is nothing to think about!
commander...
mathesar, i need you to prepare pods for my crew.
there is nobody here. jason...
mathesar, maybe we should get some of your crew up here.
yes... hi sarris... how are you doing?
better than my lieutenant.  he failed to activate ship's neutron armor as quickly as I would hoped on our last encounter.
right.  well... listen, I am  I am sorry about that whole... thing.. before. it was kind of a misunderstanding.  I am sure we can work this out like reasonable people... how is the uh...  ... that going to heal up? god, i hope so, i feel just awful about that.
deliver the device now or i will destroy your ship.
listen, I would like to, but frankly.. I am not even sure where it is, or even...
you have ten seconds.
all right. you got it. you win. I will deliver it now.  just give me a moment to set it up.
all right, now nobody panic, I have dealt with this guy before and believe me, he is as stupid as he is ugly.
jason..
we are going to fire everything we have got at him, all right?
jason...
you just keep pushing those buttons, those there, send everything at him, okay?
...okay
all right. put me back on with him.
i made the cut the line gesture. you nodded okay.'
i thought it was the "we're dead" gesture! i was agreeing! like i know where the hold button is???
listen, sarris, you can not blame me for trying...
where?
just go! go! dammit punch go!
the ship is sustaining structural damage.
guys, we are sustaining structural damage!...
faster tommy. get us out of here!
it is as far as it goes!
they are still behind us...
we should have a turbo. I am always saying "activate turbo boosters", right?...
could be this.
push it. hold it down.
the enemy is matching velocity.
the enemy is matching velocity.
we heard it the first time!
shit! I am doing it! I am repeating the damn computer!
we have got to stop!
we stop we die. keep holding the thruster down tommy!
you do not hold a thruster down! it is for quick boosts
like you know?
maybe we can lose them in that cloud.
i do not think that is a cloud...
mathesar? what is that?
it is the tothian mine field left standing from the great war of 12185.
may i get the check?
the ships are gaining...
do your best, tommy...
oh god...
could you possibly try  not to hit  every  single  one!
they are drifting toward me... i think they are magnetic!...
continue forward, sir?
patience, lt. . patience.
we have have to stop!
front armor is gone! just slow it down a little!
no!  we are almost through!
do not be insane, stop! full stop!
keep going! keep going!
what is happened?
the engines are dead. we are drifting.
are they behind us?
no, i do not think so... wait. they are not but...  something is.  oh my god.
"go into the cloud! ...
alex? where are you going?
to see if there is a pub.
computer, what about our engines? why do not we have power?
the beryllium sphere has fractured under stress.
it is fractured...
can it be repaired?
computer, can it be repaired?
negative. the beryllium sphere will have to be replaced.
we need another one.
do we have a replacement beryllium sphere onboard?
computer, do we have a replacement beryllium sphere onboard?
negative, no reserve beryllium sphere exists onboard.
no, we do not have an extra beryllium sphere.
you know, that is really getting annoying.
i have one job on this lousy ship. it is stupid, but I am going to do it. got it?
sure, no problem.
a thousand apologies. we have failed you.
you what?.. what are you talking about?
we have seen you victorious in many more desperate situations. the fault must lie with us, with the ship...
"deception..." "lies."
well... sort of...
we have become aware of these concepts only recently. in our dealings with sarris. often sarris will say one thing, and do another. promise us mercy and deliver destruction... it is a concept we are beginning to learn at some great cost.  but if you are saying that any of you could have traits in common with sarris.
hey commander. listen, we found some beryllium on a nearby planet. we might be able to get there if we re-configure the solar matrix in parallel for endothermic propulsion. what do you think?
i...well, uh... yes, absolutely.
dr. lazarus, here is your surface mapper.  i have programed it to the coordinates of a beryllium sphere of sufficient density.
thanks.
good luck on your mission, sir. by grabthar's hammer, by the suns of warvan i wish you-
uh uh! what did we talk about?
right... sorry, sir.
guy, you are not going to get killed on the planet, okay?
oh, I am not? I am not? then what is my last name?
your last name.
yeah, what is it?
it's... i do not know.
no. nobody does. do you know why? because my character is not important enough for a last name. because I am going to die five minutes in, why bother to come up with a last name for me?
guy, you have a last name. we just do not know it.
do i? do i?  for all you know I am just "crewman #6"!  okay, it is fleegman! guy fleegman! there! now I am a whole person! i can not die! fleegman! they can not kill me now, can they? can they?
you were holding it upside down were not you?
shut up.
you know, with the makeup and everything1 i actually thought he was smart for a second.
you think you could do better "laredo?"
hey, watch that "laredo" shit.
we are screwed... we are so screwed...
all right, let's all settle down.  if we are going to get through this we are going to have to exercise self control.
self control?  that is funny coming from the guy that slept with every moon princess and terrakian slave girl on the show!...
did it ever occur to you that if you had been a little more supportive you could have held on to me?
i could have held on to you! ...
about this much.
what is the scale?  is that ten miles? a hundred miles?
this much.
you are playing your good side.
do not be ridiculous.
and note the sucked in gut.
...sleeves rolled halfway up the biceps...
that is it, that is what is going to kill me.
let's just pick up the pace a little, shall we?
there it is. the beryllium sphere.
must be some sort of mining facility.
where are the miners?
something bad happened here.
look at that... will you look at that... they look like little children...
could they be the miners?
you okay, alex?
i do not like this... i do not like this at all...
oh, they are so cute.
of course they are cute now. but in a second they are going to turn mean and ugly somehow and then there are going to be a million more of them!...
i am so sick of being right.
let's get out of here before one of those things kills guy.
all right... here's the plan:  first, fred, we need a diversion to clear those things out of the compound, then gwen, alex, fred and i go down to get the sphere.  any of those things come back, give a signal. guy, you set up a perimeter.
why does this sound so familiar?
"assault on voltareck iii."  episode... 31 i think.
we are doing episode 31?
whatever, the one with the hologram. the wall of fire.
how the hell is fred supposed to project a hologram?
we are doing episode 31, jason?
it does not have to be a hologram... just a diversion.
jason, are we doing episode 31 or not?
it is a rough plan, guy! what does it matter if we are doing episode 31 or not?!
because i died in episode 31!
this is ludicrous.  why are you listening to this man?  must i remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  he is no more equipped to lead us than this fellow.  no offense.
you have a better plan, alex?
as a matter of fact, i do. look at their eyes. they are obviously nocturnal. come sundown they will go into the forest to hunt. so our plan is simply to wait for nightfall instead of mounting an insane assault in full daylight simply because we did it that way in episode 31.'
a hologram...
never mind, fred....
no, no... I will think on it...
they are gone.
where did they go? back inside?
i do not know.
nobody was watching?
all right, gwen, alex, fred, follow me.  guy, set up the perimeter. tommy, you keep a lookout, make a signal if they come back.
what kind of signal?
anything.
okay, I will do this...  "caw caw!"
tommy, we have these...
oh, right, sorry.
okay, let's go.
you have no idea what a perimeter is, do you?
not a clue. you?
i think he just likes pointing at things.
how does the rolling help, actually?
it helps.
those blue things ate everybody here?
it does not make sense... surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
clenched jaw...
will you stop riding me?!
sorry guys... it just went off.
good work, tommy.  let's go!
go ahead!
you go first! there is no time!
oh, of course, i forgot! you have to be the hero, do not you?... heaven forbid anyone else get the spotlight once! oh no, jason nesmith could not possibly-
oh my god! tommy! stop the pod! stop the pod!
i can't...  it is on autopilot!...
he knocked me out the sonofabitch. where is he?
down there.
we got the sphere but the commander's down there with a bunch of cannibals!  teb, reset the pod, we are going back.
that thing's not going to get us down there fast enough.  face it, he is dead.
wait, fred, what about your thing, you know... "digitize me, sergeant chen!"
...the digital conveyor.
of course... we will just zap him up with the digital conveyor!
you said "the commander.
what?
back there. you said "the commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
no i didn't.
yes you did.
i heard it too.
is this really the most important thing we could be talking about right now?
jason.. can you hear me?
yes. yes, I am here!
thank god. are you okay?
yeah. but I have got gorignak staring me in the face. i think i can take it though...
jason, we are going to use the digital conveyer to get you out of there.
the digital conveyer?  you mean I am going to get diced into cubes and sorted up there in a thousand pieces?
right.
I will take my chances with gorignak.
what?  what did he say?
nothing. hold please.
okay... on what?
how about the pig-lizard?
hey i was doing okay with the pig lizard.
what?  what?
nothing.
i heard something. a squeal.
wait, the pig lizard is gone. why are they still chanting for the pig lizard?
turn on the translation circuit.
jason?...  i do not think the pig lizard was gorignak...
what the hell are you talking about?
fred's no good, jason. you are going to have to kill it
kill it? well I am open to ideas!...
go for the eyes. like in episode 22 with-
it does not have eyes.
the throat, the mouth... its vulnerable spots.
it is a rock. it does not have vulnerable spots!
i know...  you contruct a weapon.  look around, can you form some sort of rudimentary lathe?...
a lathe??? get off the line, guy.'
alexander??? please? you are my advisor, advise me!
... . well  you have to figure out what it wants... what is its motivation?
it is a damn rock monster!!! it does not have motivation!
that is your problem.  you were never serious about the caraft...  "i'm a rock... i just want to be a rock... still. peaceful.. tranquil.." ..."oh, but what is this?  something is making noise... no, not noise, no... movement.  vibrations.  make the vibrations stop, they go straight into me like a knife!... i must crush the thing that makes the vibrations..."
am i crazy, or do you actually have something there?
no, I will kill you. .
listen fred. you did this for four years on the show. you can do it now... put your hands on the controls..
fred, i worked summer stock with hopkins. regional theater with hoffman. but i swear to god i have never met an actor who could hit his mark, or nail his lines with the professional consistency of a freddy kwan. you are mr. dependable... you can do this.
you worked with hopkins? i worship hopkins.
as good as hopkins?
hopkins can not drink your bathwater fred.
no no no.
we have got to get out of here.  c'mon, hurry
yes.
then tell me one thing... what does it do, the device? the omega 13.
i do not know.
is it a bomb?  a booby trap?  tell me!
stop, please! i do not know!
prepare a tear harness for the female...
no! i swear i do not know! please!
do you think I am a fool? that the commander does not know every bolt, every weld of his ship?
wait. what did you say?
please, do not hurt them, it is not their fault. I am not the commander, i do not know anything.
explain -
gwen. the show. there is no choice. do it.
my name is jason nesmith. I am an actor. we are all actors.
our dimwitted friends do not understand the concept of acting. they have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
we pretend...
simpler.
we.. we lie.
yes... you understand that, do not you, mathesar?...
I am not a commander, there is no national space exploration administration. there is no snip.
but there it is!...
a model, only as big as this.
but... inside, i have seen-
sections of rooms made of plywood. our beryllium sphere was painted wire and plaster. the digital conveyor was christmas lights... decorations.  it is all a fake.  I am not him...  I am a nothing. a nobody.
but...why?
it is difficult to... on our planet we pretend in order to... entertain.
lieutenant lathe, i confess i am beginning to feel a bit foolish myself. chasing across the universe to obtain what is, i am now certain, a bauble of fiction. tell me how best to obliterate this vessel? i would like nothing to remain.
the core could be hardwired to overload without much effort.
hundreds dead, all so you could play at being the commander.' you have murdered us all you egomaniacal sonofabitch!
shut up.' just shut up you purple skinned monstronsity,
"purple skinned monstrosity...?"
i was staying in character.  "egomaniacal sonofabitch?"
sense memory. i see you got to win the fight...
i had the shot...
all right guys... uh... gwen and i are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. fred, you and guy need to get that air valve back on.  alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case fred and guy can not get the oxygen back in time.
jason? what about me? what do i do?
practice driving, tommy.
so... we get to shut down the neutron reactor?
right.
uh... i hate to break it to you jason, but i do not know how to shut down a neutron reactor, and unless you took a learning annex course i do not know about, I am pretty sure you do not know how to shut down a neutron reactor either.
no i don't. but i know somebody who does.
... yes?
we accidently traded vox units when we bumped into each other on saturday.
oh... oh, i see. oh.
what is  your name, son?
brandon.
brandon, i remember you from the convention, right?... you had a lot of little technical observations about the ship, and i spoke sharply to you...
yes, i know, and i want you to know i thought about what you said... i know you meant it constructively but...
it is okay. listen-
... but i want you to know that i am not a complete braincase, okay? i understand completely that it is just a tv show. there is no ship, there is no beryllium sphere, no diagital conveyor... i mean, obviously it is all just a-
it is real, brandon. all of it, it is real.
i knew it!... i knew it!...
brandon.. . the crew and i are in trouble and we need your help.
sir, it is you  thank ipthar!
quellek. what are you doing in there?
i avoided capture using the mak'tar stealth haze.  where is everyone?
come with me. I will explain on the way.
there is no hatch.  there is no hatch!
wait... jason, here!...
okay, we got it.
okay, you can go on in... I am going to get kyle. he knows the utility tunnel system better than anybody alive.
hi brandon.
no time for pleasantries, kyle. we have a level five emergency. the commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
oh.  okay.
you have got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
i have sectors 1-28.  i think hector has the upper levels.
we would better get everybody online.  and kyle, stop downloading porn.  your frame rate is unacceptable.
okay, now left at the next turn... past the oxygen units.  make a right there. then go through the antimatter vent...
okay...  okay, now what.
now make a right, you will see a doorway that opens on the central manufacturing facility.  the bowels of the ship.
commander, do you have a camera?  I would die to see this in person... all they showed on t,v was a machine here, and a wall here... i do not know why they did not show the whole thing.
we would never have the budget for this.
okay, so do you see a door marked "core unit?" should be down at the far end to your left.
yes...?
okay, that is where you want to be.
we have got to get that valve turned off. their oxygen is almost gone...
listen, I will go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
it is suicide.
I am just a glorified extra, fred.  I am a dead man anyway. if I am going to die, I would rather go out a hero than a coward.
maybe you are the plucky comic relief, you ever think of that?
find them.
but sir, my men. the core implosion is not reversible...
find them.
brandon.. just in case i die, there is something i have to know...
yes commander?
what does the omega 13 do?
well, that is the big question, is not it?
what do you mean?
it is been the subject of an extremely heated debate on the internet for years. many believe that is a matter collapser, a bomb capable of destroying all matter in the universe in a chain reaction lasting 13 seconds.
but you don't?
no,  i am of the firm belief that in reality it is not a matter killer, but a matter rearranger, converting all molecules to the exact state they existed thirteen seconds previous to activation thus effecting a thirteen second time jump to the past.
how did you come to that conclusion?
my cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. his favorite movie is the omegaman.  he is seen it 13 times...
brandon!	time to go!
yes commander... all right, you are almost there. just go through the chompers and over the pit.
what is that thing? it serves no useful purpose to have a bunch of choppy crushy things in the middle of a catwalk!?.'
gwen...
we should not have to do this!  it makes no logical sense! why is it here?
because it was on the show!
well forget it!  I am not going.  this episode was badly written!
commander, you and lt. madison will have to go through the crushers one at a time in three second intervals. tell me when the first crusher hits the bottom...
okay, now. but-
wait two seconds then go.
no, wait, are you-
lt. madison, go.
shit! go!
go commander.
go. they are off again.
up.
what?  up?
berithium lava coming through. use the handholds above you.
sir! the pressure.  it is normalizing.
open.
