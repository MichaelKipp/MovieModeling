i said no.
but you do not really mean it.
maybe it will not stay in.
maybe you better just drive me home.
let me just ask you a serious question first.
what?
are not you worried you could die a virgin?
yeah. I am extremely worried about that. it is right up there with global warming.
on our way home, a drunken driver could hit us head on and send us flying through the windshield. terminate us instantly. we would never experience what it means to make love.
if sheep do not count.
that was not me ...
i know. I am kidding you. chill out.
well I am trying to be real here and you are mocking me.
I am sorry, but you are not going to die a virgin rod.
rod!
you are being unfair.
unfair?!
yes. unfair to me.
stacy?
rod!
cut it out.
why?
i was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
so? you are already late. a few more minutes will not matter.
i got to get home.
fuck your curfew. most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
you know, maybe we ought to start seeing other people.
what?
jody, we have been going out for over a year. i love you but I am all out of patience.
it is almost ten o'clock.
daddy you scared me!
you are grounded friday night!
what? i was at sandy's i just lost track of time.
your curfew is 9:30 and you know it, little miss.
it will not happen again.
you said that two weeks ago.
dad ! most of my friends can stay out until 11 on school nights and 1 on weekends!
they are not all the sheriff's daughter. goodnight.
what happened?
two kids were found mutilated in the woods. lock the door after me.
what kind of a person wakes up in the morning and says to themselves, 'think I will nail a sixteen year old girl to a tree today'?
the same type that decides to carve into her stomach.
you are not planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both stacy and rod, are you?
no.
good.
but i am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.
fine, just do not mention the carving this is going to be a tough enough day as it is.
hi honey.
hi daddy. hi mr. sisler.
hi jody.
i just wanted to check that you were okay?
I am fine. I have just never had someone my age die before. it is so weird.
how well did you know stacy and rod?
I have been in the same class with stacy for years but we were not tight or anything.
had either of them broken up with someone recently? hurt someone?
no. those two were together before kenny and i started hanging out and that is over, what, god a year now.
i want you to head right home after school.
i will. is that all?
why did you send for lenny marliston?
the kids adore him. they confide in him. his patchouli reeking rear might know if stacy and rod were really virgins. why did not you ask jody that?
she is my daughter, tom.
so?
so you just do not point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
why not? you worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
go sit next to him.
who?
mark shale.
why?
do not you want to talk to him? you watch him eat everyday.
i do not watch him eat everyday.
you stare at him non-stop, like every lunch. like this. like most people stare at car accidents.
the seat behind him is open. come on, i can eavesdrop too.
you eventually have to talk to him.
why? all my mom and dad ever do is watch each other eat and they have been married for twenty years.
no! that is his table.
you are going to look really amoebic splitting off from me now.
yeah. chris berringer was parked outside the window.
i wonder why it is so important to know if they fucked?
what i do not understand is why they asked marliston if rod was a virgin. they could have asked you cindy.
i never fucked rod.
exactly. then he must be a virgin.
if I am so all-used-up ben, why do you try to hook me up non-stop?
as fucking if.
dylan's been telling people that annette gave him a blow job.
and she didn't?
i think it is funny.
me too. I am going to start telling people that i saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
what am i supposed to say? 'nice sweater mark'? 'did you buy it at eddie bauer's?'
you could tell him you really liked the way he chews with his back molars.
you are so fucking lucky your dad is the sheriff.
you are 'sp fucking' wrong.
you get to be a little chelsea clinton. everyone wants to meet you. party with you. have sex with you.
but you can not do any of it. so it sucks. i always have to 'set an example'.
he is just trying to mess with your head. ignore him.
does she fuck?
i doubt it. who would want to fuck her. she probably reeks worse than the docks down in those panties.
oh nice save.
i was desperate. it was gross.
kenny'll come running back. this is just his way of pressuring you.
he says he loves me.
personally i think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. but i suppose that is a type of love. i certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
maybe i should blister through a bottle of tequila and just fuck his brains out.
no!
you are the one always saying 'just do it'.
that was before he pulled this 'dick me or i dump you' shit. i say fuck his best friend.
i do not know what I am so scared of.
want to come in for awhile? log onto aol, flirt with some married men, head into a private s&m chat room . . .
how do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
i keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
i promised I would go right home after school.
ok. increase the peace.
yeah?
I am lisa sherman. dylan's aunt. he asked me to come talk to you.
why?
he feels terrible about those things he said to you in school.
he should. four guys hit on me today, and not because they find me intellectually stimulating.
i think i know how to restore your reputation.
you do?
can i come in? I will need to use the phone.
is jody still awake?
she just turned off her light.
hi honey.
what is wrong?
i have a question to ask you. a personal question.
what do you mean?
well, i assume you let him kiss you?
well yeah. of course. everyone kisses.
I am not criticizing. _ did you two get any further?
a little.
how much further?
daddy! i do not think this is any of your business!
i would not ask if i did not have to.
not much further.
you never went, uh, all the way?
ok.
daddy, are you upset that I am still a virgin?!
no honey.
you are upset.
I am not.
i thought you would be pleased.
i am. I am so very proud of you. go back to sleep.
well?
she is still a virgin.
did you warn her?
no. let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
if I would gone public with this yesterday annette michaels might be alive today.
oh god brent, is there anything you do not feel guilty about?
is there anything you do?
focus on the present. you always want to change the past. let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
I am going to tell them everything i know. I am calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
you tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we are going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
better than a pile of dead teenagers.
sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. he can not butcher all of us.
there will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
not that many.
you watch. there is going to be a hymen holocaust tomorrow. maybe I will finally talk to mark shale.
no?!
yes?
are you jody?
yeah.
I am kenny's aunt lisa.
kenny's aunt?
yes. he asked me to come over and talk to you.
on what side of the family?
his mother's side.
his mother's an only child.
it was a she.
are you sure?
she said she was kenny's aunt lisa.
what are you doing?
this will relax her.
she is underage.
someone tried to kill me.
the phone just went dead. i called the police and ran right over as fast as i could.
I am not fucking you. not for all your cds.
you want me to die? i thought you and i were tight.
are you the killer ben?
would that impress you? is that what it takes to impress the empress?
your mind is just twisted enough. i believe you would do all this just to get a dip or two.
hi mark, cindy, ben.
hi sandy.
you got a great mom. I am lucky to get a zucchini stick.
did you want one?
yeah i was talking about twinkies the other day and i realized i had not had one in years. then i remembered seeing you with one.
they are tasty.
you can have both if you want.
no, you keep one.
you know her?
it can not be.
who is she daddy?
never mind darling. you go back to school. i do not want you missing anymore classes today.
it is lisa sherman. but she still looks like we are eighteen.
that is impossible.
i swear to god. it is her. she told jody she was kenny's 'aunt lisa'. I am getting this sickly feeling...
calm down brent.
you were eavesdropping.
no i wasn't.
what did you hear?
nothing. i just picked up the phone to say goodbye to you. you did not say goodbye.
ok. goodbye. now get back to school.
you ok?
fine. are you?
hurricane hormone. it is flattened the whole school. guess what?
what?
mark invited me to the party.
what party?
shh. ben's party. tonight. have not you heard?
no.
you can not tell your parents.
ok.
especially not your dad.
i won't.
it is like a pop your cherry party. everyone's saying it is 'fuck or die' time.
you are thinking of sleeping with mark tonight?
unless he makes a move during seventh period.
did not you have something a little more romantic in mind for your first time?
i kind of like the idea that we can all lose it together, on the same night. it will be a lot less scary. you have to go.
stag?
kenny'll want to go with you. cindy's holding a q and a session at the bleachers. come on.
i can not right now.
jody, you have to go to the party. for your own safety.
are you o.k.?
I am fine.
i heard you got attacked.
i did.
i was worried about you. did you hear about the bash?
yeah. i think it is really sick.
why?
three of our classmates are dead. that is not really the occasion for a party.
nobody wants to be the fourth. please go with me.
did sharon say no?
you know i want to go with you.
I am so flattered but i can't. I am grounded.
everyone's grounded. there is a killer on the loose.
no I am really grounded. when i got in late the other night, my father was waiting up for me.
if you do not want to go with me just say so. say 'kenny, i do not want to make love to you' but do not use your dad as an excuse. I am so sick of it.
I am not using him as an excuse.
yes you are. you always do. it is why we broke up. you always hide behind him.
i do not.
i feel like i need you dad's permission just to kiss you. jody, it is time to assert yourself to be a big girl. an individual. I am going to this party tonight. jimmy's my ride. come over to my house after school. we will go together.
i have to go home after school. i have something really important i have to ask my mom.
they are not picking me up until six.
I will think about it.
yes!
hi mom.
hi princess.
mom?
yes?
i need to ask you something.
you can ask me anything.
have you ever heard of someone named lisa sherman?
lisa sherman?
yeah. who is she?
i do not know. where did you hear that name.
i overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. i he thinks she is the killer.
what?
that is what he said.
did he say anything else about her?
no but he got really weird. like I have never seen him act. really angry and super uptight.
I have never heard of her. maybe something else was on his mind.
no. i think she lived her a long time ago. like twenty-eight years ago. when dad was eighteen.
not that i know of.
where are you going?
the library. I will be fine.
you found her?
there is a lisa shermer living just sixty miles west of here. over the indiana border. I am going.
we need you here. i can bring her in.
no. I will handle this.
as bizarre as it may sound, seems someone is planning to have a big party tonight.
no?
should we close down any eruption?
are you sure?
we are seeing all the signs in town.
i like the idea of all the kids in one place. if it happens, just keep a man outside until you hear from me. I will be back in a couple of hours.
hi jody. what can i do for you?
hi miss dunlop. where do you keep the old town papers?
they are all on microfiche. what year are you looking for?
twenty eight years ago.
follow me.
this place is empty.
everyone's getting ready for the party.
you heard about that?
of course. no one ever shuts up in the libary. kids were whispering about it all day.
do not you think it is sick?
not at all. in fact, i thought about going.
you miss dunlop?
unfortunately i qualify. think I am too old?
no.
you are sweet. i really wish someone had thrown a party like that when i was your age. my life might have been very different.
i want you to come home with me right now, jody.
who is she?
she is nobody you should be concerned with.
whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of lisa sherman, clothes and all. i think that concerns me.
do not make me order you.
wait.
what?
I am not leaving. i want to know why you and dad are so freaked out. three of my classmates are dead.
years ago, something horrible happened in this town. when i was still in high school. a girl named elizabeth sherman was attacked by four drunken seniors.
attacked how?
she was raped. at least that is what she claimed.
you did not believe her?
no, i believed her. she was in pretty bad shape. inside and out. but the boys were never formally charged.
why not?
they were children of our leading citizens, stars of the football team. and she was  a loner. an angry girl that no one really liked. she would called them 'queers'.
people thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?
they were proving to her they weren't. they were very drunk. things were different back then. you think kids are sexually bottled up today....
and the police did nothing?
everyone just kind of looked the other way.
how could you?
i do not know. we just did. i guess i was kind of scared going against the gain. against the whole town.
the word is mob.
I have regretted it ever since. never run with the herd just because they are the herd.
who were they?
who?
the men. do any of them still live around here?
two men left town right after it happened.
you are not telling me something.
mr. sisler was one of them.
the principal?
yes.
who was the fourth?
that is why he called mr. sisler first. he was one of them.
not a day has gone by where your father has not torn himself to shreds for what happened. we both have...
no!
hello?
I am looking for lisa sherman.
she is not here.
you know where i can find her?
st. michael's.
she works at a church?
she resides there. out back. she died a year and a half ago.
of what?
a bullet to the right cerebellum.
she was murdered?
no. she ate a pistol for lunch one day.
can you describe her? how old was she?
i never met the woman. I am just taking care of the place until they sell it.
can you get inside?
i can.
i knew lisa sherman long ago. it is extremely important that i get inside and try to verify that it is the same woman who lived here.
i do not give a fuck what your reasons are. you pay me ten dollars, you can go inside otherwise, get a warrant.
is there a picture of her somewhere?
no pictures. no mirrors. was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
no.
could not tell she going to off herself, huh?
no, you couldn't.
I have been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.
really?
yeah. you should check downstairs.
why?
people always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. all the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
all our parents are weirdoes. i think my dad is into hookers. i know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
my dad acts like he is johnny fucking perfect and he is really johnny fucking rapist.
i think this is a big part of growing up. it is losing your spiritual virginity. it is when you finally discover that your parents are not anything they told you they were. they are even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
i can not believe i listened to one word of his shit.
but if he would been sent to jail, there would be no jody.
so i should feel happy that he got away with it?
i do not know. i kind of am.
are you coming to the party?
let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
what is wrong? am i doing something wrong?
just making me feel like a piece of meat.
I am making you feel like meat?
yeah.
you break up with me because i will not fuck you.
that is not why we broke up.
you flaunt some slut in my face.
sharon's far from a slut.
and when i finally agree to spread my legs, you accuse me of treating you like meat.
jody, you are only doing this to get back at your dad. it does not have that much to do with me.
please do not go. please. stay, we will just talk. then go to the party.
this party is sick.
jody. wait.
what?
I am scared. three kids are dead. i want to go to this party.
then go to the party. run with the herd kenny. just do not spew out all that 'be an individual, assert yourself' crap anymore.
i know where you are going.

your brother told us.
daddy....
shh. I am not going to tell you not to go.
you are not?
no. i could not do that. i have something for you.
there is jan and heather. let's grab them quick before someone else does.
ok.
hide your laptop here.
no.
you can not bring it.
I am not leaving it here.
i get all your cds.
not my imports.
ok not your imports. all your other cds and your k2 snowboard.
that is an awful lot for ten minutes of beasting?
do not flatter yourself. you will be lucky to last ten seconds with me ben.
i am.
my house is just a couple of blocks away. why do not you come on over and clean those cuts up.
ok. should i put my bike in the back of your car?
can you just follow me? the back is full?
sure.
you are not going to the party?
you know about that too?
of course. you are not scared?
of course I am scared.
then you should go.
you think i should go to the party, mr. marliston?
i really do. for your own safety.
we are all manipulated. from the moment we are born. the event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before i was even born.
really?
yes. we have no real freedom. you of all people should understand that. this may sting.
me? why me?
because of your father. the way what his sins shaped you.
what do you know about my father?
he is a rapist. like mine.
_ your father raped someone?
lisa sherman was my mother. do you know who that is?
yes.
i was born nine months after she was raped. one of the four men who raped her is my father. i have no idea which one.
you are the killed.
yes that is the whole point. this is what i was put on this earth to do. rape the town that raped my mother. steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I have planned this since i was a very little boy. you have no real freedom either. your father has cast a shadow that you have never eluded.
you are so beautiful.
so are you.
now do not be nervous.
you are the one who is hand is shaking.
hey! that was a 3k machine.
told you to hide it.
one more time.
i get the imports.
ok!
you ok?
just thinking about something.
what?
there is going to be very few virgins left in school on monday. it could be really dangerous for them if the killer is not caught.
i guess so. luckily we will not have that problem.
what are you doing?
i got to go.
what?
I am worried about someone.
no!
run!
my dad's down there!
he is dead! we have got to get the fuck out of here!
go to the police station!
deputy webber's at the party. it is only three blocks away.
we just found another body.
who's?
tom sisler. he was murdered at school. two kids went into his office to fuck and they found him, with his tongue cut out and his foot jammed into his mouth. killer also chopped off his pecker and stuffed it in his pencil holder.
jesus. any word from brent?
nope. the switchboard is lightning up downtown. kids from other towns are starting to congregate in the parks and at the high school. it is turning into woodstock except there is no concert.
call brent on the horn. see where he is. what he wants us to do. I will head over to the school.
ok.
but i should not shut it down?
no. hell, it is the quietest goddamn party I have ever seen.
thanks for coming back for me.
i love you.
oh god it is him!
quick! in the house. he will not look for us in there.
what are you doing?
pretend we are just another couple.
pay no attention to me.
what are you doing here?
you fucked me up!
what?
you gave me a 'd'.
I am sure you should have failed.
i was grounded for two fucking months because of you!
please get out of my way or I will have to hurt you.
i knew you were a pervert. always wearing those fucking doofy glasses, and driving a station wagon.
please! you would not kill your sister, would you?
you think you are my sister?
