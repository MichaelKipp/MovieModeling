thank god -- thank god i've got you.
who is this?
you mustn't hang up.
do i know you?
i've been trying to get someone -- anyone.  for hours ...
if this is some sales pitch i'm not buying --
you don't understand.
no.  <u>you</u> don't understand!  you caught me on my cellular on the way to pick up some business associates.  and i've got no time to screw around.
will you let me explain!
and what're you whispering for?
i can't talk any louder.  they might hear.
lady, try making some sense.
you may be our only chance.  i don't know if i can do this again.
what'd you do!  just pick my number out of the air?
they smashed the phone.  i've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
who smashed the phone?
they're holding my husband downstairs.
sure.  and they left you upstairs to make phone calls?
they gave me pills to make me sleep.  they didn't realize how much seconal i'm used to -- that i'd have so much tolerance --
well i'm not tolerant of being bothered with this bullshit story when i'm about to make the most important score of my life.  this has gotta be some "put-on," right?
i'm sorry.  i'm so sorry to do this to you.
you're not doing anything to me -- because -- listen to this carefully -- i do not care.
i don't believe you.
you're the one who's not to be believed.
my name is --
i don't want to know --
my name is lenore oberfeld.
don't expect me to tell you who i am.
i realize you don't want to be involved.
i am not involved.  keep clicking your little wires.  you'll get someone else.  good luck.
you won't disconnect.
oh won't i?
because you know you'll be killing us.
don't lay this on me!
then hang up!  do it!
why would anybody want to hurt you?
they tortured my husband.  made him give them the pin numbers of our accounts.  once they get what's in the safe deposit box they'll kill us.
where'd they take you to?
i have no idea.  they put us in the back of a van with blacked out windows.  the shutters up here are nailed shut.
well isn't there a number on the goddam phone?
no -- nothing.
okay.  the police are gonna need your full name and address.
no!  no police.  they'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  they'll kill us. we've seen their faces.
the cops could trace this call back to you.
one of them <u>is</u> a cop.
what makes you say that?
he pulled us over as we left the riviera tennis club.  claimed we'd run a stop sign.  and when elliot was reaching for his license --
who?
elliot -- our driver.  the officer put his gun to the back of elliot's head and -- fired.  it was so quick.
oh man.  these people mean business.
then they took the mercedes away -- with his body in it.
listen, there's an overpass coming up.  i may lose you for a minute.
no don't.  you could lose me for good.  don't go through that tunnel.
i'm in traffic.  there's no place to turn.
please.
shit!
hey buddy!  can you let me pull over?  give me some space to pull over.
where do you think you're going?
any place.
this is one way.
i know.  but it's an emergency. somebody dying.  okay?
i don't see anybody in there but you.
i would appreciate a little space. thank you.
fine, no tunnel.  are you still with me?  hello?
i hear them coming upstairs.  i won't be able to talk for awhile. i have to lay the phone down and pretend to be asleep.  so don't talk.  don't say a word or they'll hear it.
i can't stay on this line.  i'm picking people up.  i'm already overdue.  hello?
who's on the phone?
i'll explain later.  i'm sort of on hold.
you switched license plates?
it's taken care of.
we have never worked a gig together but i am a firm believer in preparation.  so let's go over this again step by step.
not this minute.
what was that for?
you could've made me lose my call.
so what?  what could be important enough to put your hands on me?
i didn't hurt you.
you couldn't hurt me.  but it's the principle.
that was definitely out of line and totally unprovoked.  i heard you were a hitter.
bullshit.
that's your "rep."
wait!  i hear her breathing now. there, she just picked it up again.
say something ...
me, he won't stay on the phone with for five fucking minutes without bitching.
i'm trying to help somebody. okay?
he's at it again.  like that night at the emerald.  this piece of euro-trash is slapping shit out of his little wife in a back booth -- so mr. good deed here has got to step in and pound the fucker's head into the wall.  meantime "wifey" recovers enough to pull off her high heel and nearly take our hero's eye out.  it took six stitches.
how was i in the wrong?
be careful.  there were people in that crosswalk.
that's all we need.  better let me drive.
i'm fine.  she's back on.  hello?  i'm here.
they just walked out.  the smaller man -- he must be dominican or haitian -- he kicked me so hard. i felt a rib crack but i never made a sound.  it's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  a throbbing.  i can't even take a deep breath.
don't move around.  you don't want to puncture a lung.
was someone in an accident?
do i hear a woman's voice?
i'm with two friends now.
rachel!  they're going after rachel now -- and i can't stop them.
stop throwing names at me.
rachel, my daughter.  she's an honor student at parker.  my god, she's only nine.
what do they need her for?
they know jack will give them what they want once they have her.
bottom line!  there's nothing i can do for you but tip the cops.
what do you mean tip the cops?  is the man a lunatic or what?
will you relax?  this in no way affects our business.  go on.
the bigger man is driving our mercedes to the school.  rachel will recognize the car.  she'll get right in.
let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
they don't know you.  they won't listen.
he's right.  you'll get my whole family killed.
he's right?  look, don't try to put blood on my hands.  you've got one hell of a nerve siding with him!
just hand up on the bitch!  fuck you, madam.  and goodbye!
that's what i deserve for listening in the first place.
i'm sorry for whatever's happened to you but we're definitely not the right people to do you any good.
don't you have children?
matter of fact i did have a kid once.  but he's a lot better off with his father in milwaukee.
have you got to tell her your life story?
this is my conversation.  i'll say what i fucking please.
wake up.  make a right at ocean avenue.  the hotel's a few blocks up on the left.
i know where it is.  give me that phone back.
i'm not finished.  under other circumstances i'd gladly go out of my way.  i don't understand why you just don't phone some other person.
she can't!  it's busted.  now hand that on back!
theo wants to talk again.
did you have to tell her my name?
"theo?"
forget who i am.  where's this school located?
26th off wilshire.
even if i got there first she wouldn't go with me.
she would if she heard my voice on the phone.
i don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
just like they say; no fucking self control.
if you know that just back off.
shit.  there's the hotel.  you overshot the driveway.
and stop with the directions.
make a "u" and go back.
that's illegal.  you want us pulled over?  i'll turn around at the corner if you'll shut the fuck up.
<u>you're</u> doing all the talk.
will you two cut it out?
this mercedes of yours, what's it look like?
we still gotta run the drill before we walk in that lobby.
go ahead then.  i'm covering the receiver.  she can't hear.
first off, this mr. chow yen doesn't speak a lot of english. the girl with him will interpret. there will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  i hope you know krugerands better than they know a <u>hockney</u>.
i improved on the fucking original.
let's hope so.  once you come out and okay everything i'll give caitlin the sign that she can bring the painting on over.
it's rolled up in the tube on the floor back there.
why isn't anyone answering me?
just hang on.  i've got a life of my own.
what if they do question the authenticity?
oh.  seems yours girlfriend is casting doubts on your expertise.
i am not!  fuck you!  theo's a genius.
any trouble, we whip out our treasury department badges -- show them the wire i'm wearing and read them their rights.  theo seizes the krugerands as evidence. naturally they start negotiating. offer to give us up somebody else. and we listen.  take notes on who bought what stolen art and tell them we have to clear it with our superiors at justice.  we pick up their passports -- escort them to their room and leave them all in the bathroom handcuffed to the plumbing.
will you please speak to me! theo?
another minute.
got your badge?
satisfied, wiseass?
in any event, whatever occurs you do not belt anybody.
what do you keep making me out to be?
okay, okay, lenore, calm down. either let me call the school or better yet, the f.b.i.
sure -- and they record your voice.  and later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. that's out!
he's right, theo.  she might not be around to back up your story. you could end up in the middle of this.
look -- i've got the lives of maybe three innocent people hanging on the end of this line.
i know you feel awful but it's not your responsibility.
then whose is it?
you gotta just look the other way.
i'm sorry.  you'll do all right without me.  keep my share.
hello?  it's just me and you again.
what about the others?
i kind of dropped them off.  they were getting on my nerves.
what are you doing now?
what do you think i'm doing?  i'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
forget about us.  just save rachel.
tell me what she looks like.
they say she resembles me -- dark hair, ponytail, very dark eyes. they all wear the same uniform.  please.  be careful.  the man driving the car must have a gun.
i'm not looking to get myself killed.  i just hope the battery on this phone holds out.
where's the fucking recharger cord?  must be in her car, dammit.
how much time do you have left on it?
i don't know.  80 or 90 minutes, tops.
why didn't you do what your friends wanted and just -- get rid of me?
i don't know.  i hung up on somebody else a long time ago, and later on i wished i hadn't of.
a woman?
hey drop it, okay?
i didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
it never healed.  i called her a lying bitch and everything else and i hung up on her.  "click." you don't exist.
and that was the end of it?
i sure as hell got my wish.  she doesn't exist.  so maybe you reached the appropriate person after all.
i'm sorry if i caused you to lose your business deal.
well you did.
what do you do for a living?
sometimes i paint.
our house always needs touching up.
pictures.
i didn't mean to insult you. you're an artist.
they say my work is somewhat derivative.
i suppose if you're a struggling artist you need a patron.
lady, you don't have to keep up a running commentary.
i'm afraid if i stop talking i'll lose you.  just name any reasonable amount and it's yours.
shit, stop with the money!  i never asked for a nickel.  i was just doing this.  and you have to fuck it up with a price tag.
i didn't mean to.  it's just the way i am.
a price on everything.
i wasn't always like that.  i don't think i was.
i'm about ten blocks from the school.
i have no right to ask for help. i've never thought of anybody but myself.
that makes two of us.
you're breaking up.  i can't hear you.  theo?
there are cables overhead.  hang on.  it'll clear up.
i've lost you.  you're gone.  i can't hear anything.
make a right.  you can't miss it.
i'm making my turn.  i see the school up ahead.
lenore, i'm here.  i'm getting out.
i can hear you again, clearly.
great.  stay with me.  there must be a hundred kids out here.
does she have a red ribbon on that ponytail?
that's not her.
does she wear glasses?
no.
i've got to ask somebody.
what's happening?
she's gone --
don't say anything.  don't alarm them.  just go!
i'm trying to.
he's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
it's not your fault, theo.  you tried.
i should've put them out of the car and come sooner!
when jack sees they've got rachel he'll tell them what they want to know.
you said they wanted to get into some particular safety deposit box?
the one in brentwood.
what bank?
the city national on san vincente.
wait just a minute.  our luck has changed.
what do you mean?
black mercedes, 600s.
i'm not doing too well.  what's the matter?
i heard someone pulling in behind the house.  i heard rachel screaming and then she stopped all of a sudden.  i don't know what they did to her.
which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
even if you found us -- what then?
i'm cutting across to bundy to brentwood.  that bank is our best bet.  if anybody shows up i could follow them.
jack will negotiate with them. he'll identify the right key and give them the information they need to gain access and they'll let rachel go.
not a chance.
don't say that.
do you know what's in that box?
i'm not supposed to -- but i do. millions in cash and bearer bonds.
they'll recognize it's not your husband.
jack was only at that branch once when he took the box years ago.
they've still got to be able to sign his name.
it's not hard to do.  i do it all the time.
i'm pretty good at signatures myself.
oh my god.  i heard her scream again.  what are they doing to her?  why can't i do anything to stop them?
you're doing what you can.  why's all this money stashed?
to hide it from the i.r.s.
how come everybody turns out to be a crook?
don't talk.  don't talk!
what's going on?
the front door slammed.  someone went out.  there's a different car starting.
i might still get there first. the lights are with me.  how would i identify the guy who shows up at the bank?
if it's the tall man -- he had one of those hair transplants.  tufts, you know.  it still hasn't grown fully in.  the other one is from the islands.  braided hair -- very dark.
it won't be him.
theo, i want you to know, you're probably the most decent man i've ever met.
yeah, sure that's me.  ask anybody.
but i guess we haven't really met -- have we?
i've got a lot of respect for you too.  for the way you feel about your family.
jack hasn't loved me for years. and now i'm afraid she's turning out to be like him.  so cold and distant.  i've let him make her like that.
why tell me this?
because you're probably the last person i'll ever talk to.
you can't give up.
when they first started questioning jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  and they began beating him.  and i watched.  and i didn't feel anything ... what kind of a person am i?
did you jiggle the phone?
no.
did you hear that click?
yes -- i think so.  another crossed line?
or somebody else there is listening in --
downstairs.  there must be an extension.  oh my god --
don't panic.  i might be wrong.  hello?  i guess i was wrong.
no.  i hear them.  they're coming upstairs.  they know!
try what you did before.  it worked before.  i won't talk anymore.
don't be afraid to say hello. your friend with the recent transplant is in no condition to deliver that briefcase.  so i've taken on the task.
who are you?
let me talk to the lady again.
there's no lady here.
if you've already killed her that's fine.  i'll keep the bonds and the cash.  we got nothing to discuss.
hold on.
if her kid or her old man have been harmed we've also got nothing to talk about.
let her tell you.
yes?  yes?
hi lenore.  it's me.  i got you back.  courtesy of star 69.  are you hurt?
they dragged me downstairs.  i thought they were going to kill me.
lucky for them they didn't.
what did you do?
i had a little encounter at the bank and our mr. transplant ended up under the wheels of a chevy.
god, if he doesn't come back --
i'm in possession of the bag he was carrying.  and i'm in a position to negotiate.  what about your husband and your child?
they're tied with duct tape so they can't speak -- but they seem to be --
who are you working for?
i'm self employed.  what kind of cut did the hairy one have?
twenty percent.
fine.  i want half.  plus the release of the family.
whatever you say.
you're making it too easy.
you got time on your side.  pretty soon they'll be missed and we'll have the law up our ass.
they saw you kill the driver.
you're up on your details, aren't you?
you can rely on them to keep quiet because this is undeclared money that could land jack there in federal prison.  he can't afford for you to get caught and have this briefcase appear as evidence.
keep talking.
you're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to i.d. you.
there are no guarantees in this life.
granted.  but i don't believe they're grieving enough for their chauffeur to piss away their own futures.
where do we meet?
it's a nice day.  how about the beach?
pass.
a large stretch of empty space with no place to hide.  temescal canyon parking lot.
what time frame have you got in mind?
it should take me twenty minutes. where are you coming from?
we can be there.
i want you all in one vehicle. your van.  if i see anybody else cruising around i'll keep going. no second chances.  you can kill them and i'll keep what i've got.
some loyalty.
there's no loyalty at the expense of my own ass.
tell the lady to relax.  tell her i can't wait to meet her in person.
she's somewhat damaged in the shipping.  but nothing makeup won't cover.
got a phone in that van?
sure.
take my number.  when you see me -- call me and i'll walk you through the exchange.  it's 308-9962 -- repeat it back.
308-9962.
beats yelling our brains out across some parking lot.
you're getting a lot of mileage out of that cellular.
i wish it had never been invented.
since when did you guys start changing tires?
only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
seems not.
if you weren't going for a spare what were you doing?
something was rattling around. some loose tools.
mind if i have a look?
why are you picking on me for?
was i picking on you?  how come you pulled in back of this fruitstand?
tell the truth, i was going to take a much needed leak.
now that'd be a misdemeanor.
i got to get going.  an agent is showing me a house up on broad beach in ten minutes.
they'll wait.  meantime, raise the lid.
what'd you do?  tail me from brentwood?
why would i do that?
let's have your license, mister.
i'm going to level with you officer.
what's this?
see for yourself, federal agent, u.s. treasury.  on the job.
i'm here.  where are you?
we don't see you.
i'm three quarters of the way up the lot behind the concession stand.
stay there.
i don't want you within two hundred feet.  park down by the lifeguard station.  nobody gets out.
it's your call.
fucking "a" it is!  any argument and i'm out of here.
just relax.
i don't need to relax.  the woman. put her on.
you'll see her.
i don't want to see her later.  i want to hear her <u>now</u>.
talk to the man.
thank you.  god bless you for helping us.
are you okay?
they wrapped tape around my wrists and ankles.
that's coming off.  how about the girl?
she's awake but she hasn't spoken. i don't know what they did to her. i don't want to think about it.
your husband?
he's in back.  lying face down. they haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  i never heard jack cry before --
you're all three of you in that van?
yes.
now you're going to do just what i tell you to.  no discussion.  no hesitation.
yes sir.
put the man back on.
satisfied?
you already tried to pull one little number on me -- and it didn't work.
i don't know what you mean.
i still don't see you.
we're waiting for the light to cross the highway.  it just changed.  we're in a grey van.  it reads "<u>noble carpet cleaners</u>."
we're waiting on you.
then just wait.  i'm counting this all out and deducting my share. while i'm at it you can be getting that tape off the lady.  and her little girl.
it's in the process.
i make my end of the cash at 184,000.  now i'm trying to figure out the bonds.  what the face value is.
you should've done all this before.
i'm not accepting criticism today. now don't make me lose count. there's already a half million in this portfolio.
her husband said there'd be one million eight.  so nine hundred to you.
my pleasure --
be careful in disposing of them. you'll have to discount 'em. you'll be lucky to clear a hundred and a quarter.
thanks for the sound advice.  now ask the woman to get out of the van and walk over here.  alone.
negative.
you'll still have the girl and the husband.
and not a nickel.
soon as mrs. oberfeld is in my car i'll toss out your first third. then i'll back up 200 feet to behind the public restroom.
and then?
you pull up -- collect your first installment.  then you let the daughter go.  when she reaches me, i'll dump out another third.  same action.  i back up again -- you pull forward.  satisfy yourself it's there.  then we do it one last time.  the final exchange. and we go our separate ways.
and they run straight to the cops who start looking for our van.
i won't let 'em.
lenore -- you promised you'd follow instructions.  we're almost there.  simply get out when they slide the van open and walk to me.
i'm not leaving my daughter behind.  not with them.
she's next.  in two or three more minutes she'll be free.
i can't do it.
don't start thinking about it.  is the tape off?
yes.
can you walk?
yes.  but i want rachel to come with me.
they won't allow that.  it's one at a time.  and you have to be first.
why can't it be her?
she's a child.  she might panic. she doesn't know me.  she might not come to me.  she might just run.
all right.  now that you explain it i see that you're right.
once you're in the car with me she's sure to come to us.
i'm sorry.  you've thought this out better than i ever could.  i'm ready now.
i'm opening the side door.  she'll step out.  but before she gets in your vehicle i want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  if it isn't there i'm shooting her in the back.
are you trying to panic the women?
that's how it is.  you see her approaching you toss out installment one.
i'm tying it up in a bundle now. where is she?
rachel -- oh my god.
just start walking.  come on. walk to me.
it's locked.
shit.  i'm sorry.
stop the crying.
she's yours.  what are we waiting on?
i'm backing up.
rachel was terrified when i left her.  i could see it in her eyes.
she'll be with you soon.  they're pulling up.  they'll realize i kept my part of the bargain.
she'll never be the same.  none of us will.
include me in that.
count it.
don't worry.
next i want to see rachel.  put her on the phone before she gets out so her mother can tell her exactly what to do.  keep her calm.  tell her you're fine and that she can join you in this car.
now i have -- it's a long story.
why didn't you just shoot them?
because a lot of people would've gotten killed.  probably all the wrong ones.
you're going to let them get away with this?
we've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  so don't get any ideas.
they tortured us.  and you're going to let them have all that money?
so far they're keeping their part of it.
they put their hands all over me.
somehow i got along better with you on the phone.  it's all there isn't it?
seems like it.
put the girl on.
for christ sakes don't point it at me.  we want to get rachel out of there in one piece.  i'm waiting for the girl.  her mother wants to talk to her.
hand me the phone.
he had a gun.  i have it now.
why are you telling him that.  are you crazy?
the rest of the money is here in the car.  why don't you come and get it?
yeah.  why don't we?
what are you planning to do when they got here?  they'll kill us. they'll kill rachel.
you're not lenore oberfeld.
there isn't any such person.
whose money is this?
it belongs to the man you took it from.  or should i saw <u>stole</u> it from?
the guy with the transplant.
jack oberfeld in person.  did you kill him?
damned if i know.
the video cameras will put you with him in the bank, and i'll bet there were enough witnesses.
at least one.
plus they'll remember you going after his daughter at school.
you timed that beautifully.
they always pick rachel up early on thursday.
i got what i fucking deserved.  i had it all.  i could've kept going!
as they say -- no good deed goes unpunished.
and all that crap about your driver being murdered by a cop --
i thought it was inspired.
there was <u>no</u> cop involved.  oh shit!  fuck!
sit completely still with both hands on the wheel -- until they get here.
why pick me to be your "mark?"
nobody's easier to con than a con man.
you knew about me.
who's in back?
l.a.p.d.
shit.  you couldn't be in much worse shape.
your friends are probably still on the line.  pick it up and say hello.
there's no way out for you.  you have to deal with us.
assure them that you're being well treated.
i thought you said you could handle him.
i'm doing fine.  theo wants to deal.
tell them i'm keeping what's left. i earned it.  i probably killed some poor bastard for it.
he seems to think he's entitled to it all.
not all.  they already have a third.  the question is how much of that are they willing to give to get you back?
you won't shoot me.  that's not your style.
we might hit a bump and the gun might go off.  ever see that tarantino movie -- where travolta blew that guy away in the back seat -- purely by accident?
do you have to point that?
absolutely.  and topanga canyon has a hell of a lot of potholes if i recall.
he seems to be headed for topanga.
i'm not trying to lose them.  nor am i exceeding any speed limits.
the one thing you don't want is to attract the police.
granted, the cops are not an alternative.  certainly not with one of their own still locked in my trunk.
i don't hear him moving around anymore.
those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  that's on their head.  all i did i was put him there.
a typical fuck-up.
what's that supposed to me?
i knew you were a loser the first night i laid eyes on you.
you, i would've noticed.
oh no, you were too busy trying to keep some croatian from slapping the shit out of his girlfriend. she showed her gratitude by almost taking your eye out with her spiked heel.
you were at the emerald that night?
naturally you didn't learn your lesson.
i guess i ought to stop seeing woman as victims.
i think it was my tone of voice more than anything else that sold you.  and when you thought i was being kicked around, i wish i could've seen your face.
you're enjoying this too much.
now you're starting to sound like a victim again.
you could've hit me.
only in the leg or the thigh. you'd live but you just wouldn't wear shorts.
you wouldn't --
yes i would.  not kill you.  but blow off a few toes, absolutely. i'm entitled to that as retribution.  it'll help you to remember me in years to come -- every time you put on stockings. they must have prosthetic toes by now -- with little nails on them you can polish --
stop talking like that!
then scream for me.  a repeat performance.  let me see how easy you can turn it on.  scream!  i want to hear you scream for me!
what's he doing?  answer me!
better reassure him.
i'm still okay.
inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  all parts intact.
he wants 75 back.
plus names, addresses and i.d. for the lot of you.  we're in this together and i need to know who my partners are.  in case i ever need to roll over on somebody.
did you hear that?
let me talk to him.  hold the phone to my ear -- but don't nudge me.
who am i talking to?
call me "nels."
okay nels, you can always keep what you've got and haul ass leaving the lovely lady for me to worry about.  i'll bet she can be friendly when it's in her best interests.
if you're looking for a quickie all you've got to do is ask.
i think i've already had a "quickie."  thank you.
it could be a fire.  this is malibu.
no, there's a police car way back there.  see it, in the distance coming around the turn?  the van is blocking it now.
what's nels' number?
259-7881.
dial him up.  we need him to run interference.
nels, don't let that cop pass you.
what am i supposed to do?
if he pulls me over he gets all the proceeds plus lenore here.
and if you ditch us we get zilch.
sure, i end up with some cash. and a lot of bonds i don't know how to dispose of.
you're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
the fuck i will!
it's in your interest, nels, since the additional passenger in my trunk -- an lapd officer is probably carrying a few bullets in him traceable to the piece you're carrying.  tell the man.
lose the hardware now.
we'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
you researched me.  you know where i live.  she'll be waiting for you there along with your split.
there's two police cars now.
tailgate me.  i'll jam on the brakes.  you go into a spin to avoid an accident and cut them off.
you want us to get ourselves killed?
from what i can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  there's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. the cops'll plow right into you.
and i end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
then you can sue the cops. collect from both ends.  tighten your belts.  here it comes.  ready?
do you think they'll walk away?
ask them.
are you guys all right?
you could've killed us.
it was the fugitive in the chrysler that caused this.  we were trying to overtake him.
no reason to kill innocent bystanders.  shit.  i can't hardly move my neck.
we've already got an ambulance on the way.  don't try to get out.
i'm not staying in here with him puking all over the place.  get this door open!
they'll have units blocking us up ahead.
that's why we're turning off onto a fire road.
some people fall apart in a pinch. but you shine.
what's happening?
i can't hear.  now there's a siren.  they must be in an ambulance.  what about the money?  nels?
wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
the money, nels ... ?
any idea where you're going?
i was sentenced to a youth camp out here when i was fourteen.  we cleared some of these same roads.
they did some great job of reforming you.
that's where this chicano correctional officer first taught me to slap paint on a canvas.  i could copy any fucking thing he put in front of me.
think you could do a picture of me?
i had it in my mind what you'd look like.  "her," i could've painted.  <u>you</u>, i'd be afraid to turn my back to mix the colors.
developer ran out of money years back.  i'd hate to think about what's living in there.
why are we stopping?
i need a break.  i've been on a marathon run ever since i had the misfortune to strike up a conversation with you.
who'd ever think, to look at you?
as a child i hated being told how sweet i looked.  that angelic little face wasn't me at all.  i had to hurt people to prove to them they had the wrong image. sometimes words were enough -- but i wasn't beyond inflicting physical pain in order to be taken seriously.  i enjoyed seeing the shock on their poor faces when they realized who i was.  that same look you gave me when i turned the gun on you.
you've had a lot of fun with me today.  what would you have done if i hadn't responded to your call?
we had a backup plan.  but i knew you'd come through for me.
yeah, i was waiting for that suggestion.
sooner or later you'll learn to trust me.
how about "later?"
what's really on your wicked little mind?
the cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
that's a reasonable possibility.
he might've heard everything we said in the car.
what's your point?
we can't leave him to repeat anything.
which one of us is elected to do the deed?
you're the man with the gun.
naturally.
naturally.
maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
only one way to find out.
lady, don't let him do it!
you got it wrong.  i'm the one that's on your side.
you almost brain me and lock me in a fucking trunk and you're on my side?  you stupid fuck!
he's seen both of us now.
look, i've got a wife.  i don't care if either of you ever get caught.
what else did you expect him to say?  do it, theo -- or give me the gun.
i'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  it may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
that's not good enough.
that's how it's going to be.
nels reporting in.  sit down where you are.  arms folded.
yes sir.
yeah?
i just strolled out of the emergency room while they were admitting rodriego.
you couldn't be calling at a worse time, nels.
i'm handling it.
he let the fucking cop out -- but he won't --
it took you long enough to get my ass out.
with all those holes nels pumped in i knew you wouldn't suffocate.
you can tell she was really worried about me.
in case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
or relieve me of it later.
only i was sloppy.  i let you take me out.  that was quite a humiliation.
don't fuck around.  pop a cap in him.
allow me.
he took it like a man.  toss him in that drainage ditch.
there's a taxi stand here.  i can meet you.
you missed.
any time you decide to let me in on it.
i prefer to have the sucker die at a more convenient location.  once nels arrives with his backpack full of goodies.
so theo and nels will appear to have whacked each other out and we never existed.  a thing of beauty. jesus, the shit you come up with!
now turn around.  i'm going to cuff you.
put those away.  we can't have marks on his wrists.
you never miss a trick.
i'll see that he stays calm.  pack the money up and put it in the trunk.
how do we get back to the freeway?
bear right till the fire road ends.  it's not far.
both hands on your lap.
nothing but cds in there.  i thought maybe you'd like some celine or whitney.
yeah, i suppose getting whacked has got to be one of your best ways to die.  particularly if you're not expecting it.  you don't know what hit you.
can you make him stop!
mind letting me make the best of a rotten situation?
just sitting here listening to her voice does it to me all over again.  no harm admitting i fell in love with the sound of you.
that's a skill you acquire when you do fantasy phone sex for a living. i must've had thirty regulars salivating at 4.99 per minute.
some nice fantasy you all cooked up for me.
took preparation.
exactly who was this oberfeld?
local lawyer for dominican dealers.  off to buy a half interest in a mall in granada hills on their behalf.
which is why we had a lot more to worry about than the law.  these are people who don't worry about reading you your rights.
i'm the one they'd be looking for.
what are you doing on theo's line?
taking messages.
he ran out on me to be with you? well fuck him!  everything worked twice as good without him.  we didn't need him then and i don't need him now.
i'm sure he'll be heartbroken.
i know he's there!  he doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
i won't let him.  he belongs to me now.  bye, sweetie.
know what else is in here?
take your hand out of there. slowly.
think about what's going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per?
you won't live to see it.
it's going to be some fucking snowstorm.
pull over!  pull over someplace.
i told you i should've cuffed him.
i want the gun emptied.  i want to see all six slugs tossed up here. and then i want out.  that's all. <u>out</u>!
five ... six.
toss them -- one at a time.  i don't want to lose count.
i already called for an ambulance.
you've got a <u>phone</u>?
doesn't everybody?
can i make a quick call?
government business?
very official.  259-7881, if i recall.
yeah?
nels!  guess who?  a friendly voice from beyond the grave.
who's this?
i thought you'd know me by now.
what does it take to kill you?
i suppose you're in your taxi?
why would she want me to think you were on ice?
intelligent question, nels.  i believe she had plans for both our bodies to be found in close proximity.
that bitch.  what's keeping you from taking off?
my compensation!  somebody still owes me -- big time!
what kind of treasury dept. business is this?
undercover.
i thought so.
your partners are currently armed and we're not.  our edge is that they don't know we're in touch.
i can see the benefit in that.
you could always disappear with what's already in your backpack.
not without the name of the contact who can discount the bonds.  i may need to pry that information out of her.  what do you stand to gain?
sweet revenge plus maybe a bit of vigorish off your end.
the 405 is coming up.
where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
in the hills above sunset.  just below the getty.
take the 405 south.
how far off are you?
five minutes.
where do i turn?
take the getty center exit -- make a right onto cisco.  it'll be a narrow winding road.  you can't miss the house.  it's a mansion built back in '29 -- spanish -- boarded up since the quake.
have your cab wait at the foot of cisco -- we'll ride up together.
and make ourselves a hell of a target.
we're gonna get there first.
how do you know?
believe me.  they couldn't be busier at the moment.
let's have your name and address. the government will want to send you a letter of commendation.
who the fuck you kidding?  send me money!
you sure know how to take a lot of punishment.
from here on, i dish it out.
better haul ass if we're gonna be inside to greet them.
i've got a couple of spare pieces stashed under the floorboards.
where's the backpack?
none of your business, but it's in the cab.  that's all mine.  when we take from them, we divide, eighty-twenty.
at those prices i'd just as soon your cabbie didn't get a look at me.
probably as close to the getty as i'll ever come.  unless you care to be my "patron," nels.  you wouldn't be the first successful thief to become a patron of the arts.
in your dreams.
don't underestimate me.  i've got original ideas of my own.  warhol got famous doing a soup can.  what would you think of a cellular phone done in acrylics?
are you busting my chops or what?
somebody better tear this down before it falls down.
stay put!  i know my way around.
nels?
i'm still in my cab -- jammed up in traffic.  are you there yet?
any minute.
i was worried about you.  both of you.
we've had our share of fuck-ups but it's going to work out fine.
give me 20 minutes at least.
who were you talking to?
them.  they won't be expecting us.
brilliant -- unless they were close enough to see the cab pull away.  in which case you just warned them.
nobody can do anything right but you!
i'm in awe.
following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
oh god -- oh no -- help me -- don't let me -- die.
didn't we play this scene before?
don't leave me here to die -- theo, please -- you can't let me die --
i'm afraid i've used up all my good deeds for the day.
i picked the wrong number when i chose you ... didn't i?
turns out you did me a favor. you're looking at a rich man.
-- the phones, theo.  don't leave any of them behind.  the cops could pull up a record of all our calls and -- find you.
i've got ... one last number for you, theo ...
i don't want it.
my fence in san francisco ... 305-4410.  maurice.  don't take less than a third on the face value of those bonds.
sure, like i'm gonna take advice from you.
i told you ... sooner or later you'd have to trust me ...
