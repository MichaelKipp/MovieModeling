you can see my predicament. my wedding ring, the symbol of fidelity to my wife, soon to be the mother of my child, was now lost in the gut of an uncatchable fish.
make him stop.
what, a father's not allowed to talk about his son?
i am a footnote in that story. i am the context for your great adventure. which never happened! incidentally! you were selling novelty products in wichita the day i was born.
jesus christ.
friend of yours? did you help him out of a bind?
come on, will. everyone likes that story.
no dad, they don't. i do not like the story. not anymore, not after a thousand times. i know all the punchlines, dad. i can tell them as well as you can.  for one night, one night in your entire life, the universe does not revolve around edward bloom. it revolves around me and my wife. how can you not understand that?
it is bad.
it is more than they thought. they are going to stop chemo.
you need to go.
probably tonight.
I am going with you.
you do not have to.
I am going with you.
the one about the witch.
your mom says i can not tell you that one anymore. you get nightmares.
I am not scared.
or are you too scared?
I will go in right now and get that eye.
then do it.
fine, i will.
fine, you do it.
fine, I am doing it.
you get the eye?
i brought it.
let's see it.
how did you get here?
we swam. the atlantic, it is not that big really.
ruth mchibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
we rented a car.
you did not need to do that. you just didn't.
thank you. I will bet you need to --
yes.
down the hall on the right. the door sticks. you have to really pull it.
is that dr. bennett's car?
he is up with your father.
how is he?
he is impossible. he will not eat. and because he will not eat, he gets weaker. and because he is weaker, he does not want to eat.
how much time does he have left?
you do not talk about those things. not yet.
will.
dr. bennett. it is good to see you.  my wife, josephine.
a pleasure.
can i see him?
absolutely. be good for you to talk to him.
you --  -- are in for a surprise.
am i?
having a kid changes everything. i mean, there is the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
did you do any of that?
no, but i hear it is terrible. then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
you think I am up for it?
you learned from the best.
people need not worry so much. it is not my time yet. this is not how i go.
really.
truly. i saw it in the eye.
the old lady by the swamp.
she was a witch.
no, she was old and probably senile. maybe schizophrenic.
i saw my death in that eye. and this is not how it happens.
so how does it happen?
surprise ending. would not want to ruin it for you.
there was this panhandler who used to stop me every morning when i came out of this coffee shop near the office.
okay.
and every day i gave him a quarter. every day. then i got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. and when i went back there, you know what he said?
what did he say?
you owe me three-fifty.
really.
true story.
when did you ever work in an office?
there is a lot you do not know about me.
you are right.
dad, I am hoping we can talk about some things while I am here.
you mean, while I am here.
I would just like to know the true versions of things. events. stories. you.
your mother has not been keeping up the pool. if you wanted to you could...
i will.
you know where the chemicals are?
i used to do it when you were gone, remember? i used to do it a lot.
i thought you were not dying.
i said this is not how i go. the last part is much more unusual. trust me on that.
hardly two stories in the whole place. now I have heard in real cities, they have got buildings so tall you can not even see the tops of 'em.
really?
would not lie to you. and they have got all-you-can-eat buffets. you can eat a lot, can not you?
i can.
so why are you wasting your time in a small town? you are a big man. you should be in the big city.
you are just trying to get me to leave, are not you? that is why they sent you here.
what is your name, giant?
karl.
mine's edward. and truthfully, i do want you to leave, karl. but i want to leave with you.  you think this town is too small for you, well, it is too small for a man of my ambition. i can not see staying here a day longer.
you do not like it?
i love every square inch of it. but i can feel the edges closing in on me. a man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  so what do you say? join me?
okay.
okay.
what did she say?
beats me.
you know anyone's who is taken it?
that poet, norther winslow did. he was going to paris, france. he must have liked it, because no one ever heard from him again.  tell you what. you take the other way and I will cut through here. meet you on the far side.
you are not trying to run away?
just to be sure, you can take my pack.
welcome to ya. what is your name?
edward bloom.
bloom like a flower?
yes.
oh. here! right here. edward bloom. we were not expecting you yet.
you were expecting me?
not yet.
what is this place?
the town of spectre. best kept secret in alabama. says here you are from ashton, right? last person we had from ashton was norther winslow.
the poet? what ever happened to him?
he is still here. let me buy you a drink. I will tell you all about it. hell, I will have him tell you.
no. I have got to meet somebody. I am already running late.
now tell me if that is not the best pie you ever ate.
it truly is.
wait! i need those!
there is no softer ground than town.
I have been working on this poem for 12 years.
really.
there is a lot of expectation. i do not want to disappoint my fans.
this is why you do not show work in progress.
norther, do you ever regret not making it to paris?
i can not imagine any place better than here.
you are a poet. you oughta be able to. and maybe if you would seen more, you could.
did you see that woman?
what did she look like?
well, she... uh...
was she nekkid?
yeah.
it is not a woman, it is a fish. no one ever catches her.
how old are you?
eighteen.
I am eight. that means when I am eighteen, you will be 28. and when I am 28, you will only be 38.
you are pretty good at arithmetic.
and when I am 38, you will be 48. and that is not much difference at all.
i have to leave. tonight.
why?
this town is everything a man could ask for. and if i were to end up here, I would consider myself lucky. but the fact is, I am not ready to end up anywhere.
no one's ever left.
how are you gonna make it without your shoes?
i suspect it will hurt a lot.
you will not find a better place!
i do not expect to.
promise me you will come back.
i promise. someday. when I am really supposed to.
i do not know if you have seen it, but josephine has some photos in the most recent newsweek.
really! that is wonderful.
i spent a week in morocco for the story. it was incredible.
we will have to pick up a copy.
really.
you are lucky to get four words out of them in english. but if you were to walk through the jungle, you would hear them speaking the most elaborate french. those parrots talk about everything: politics, movies, fashion -- everything but religion.
why not religion, dad?
it is rude to talk about religion. you never know who you are going to offend.
josephine actually went to the congo last year.
oh, so you know.
mom, would you say you understand dad?
of course.
what i mean is, do you really know what is going on in his head?
yes.
how is that possible? i mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it is another one of his stories.  you can not honestly say you know him.
yes, will, i do. and do not presume things you do not know.
would you say you understand josephine?
yes. but that is a different...
no it is not. it is exactly the same. your father and i met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level. just the same as you two.
josephine and i have a lot in common.
yes, you both think william bloom is a very smart man.  the problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone is wife. and I have been his wife longer than I have been your mother. you can not discount that.
true. but I have known him my whole life, and i do not feel like i know him at all. or ever will.
i know it is not easy. just remember, he did not choose to be your father and you did not choose to be his son. you just ended up together. you could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it would be just the same. if you ask me, it is a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.
but i understand you, mom. i always have.
well, clearly you don't. but I am not the mystery you are trying to solve right now.
before i forget, your father has papers in the basement I would like you to go through. i would not know what is important.
mom, do you know who that is? blonde hair.
was she one of your teachers?
no. but it is weird. she seemed to recognize me.
do you know who that is?
hi. how are you feeling?
i was dreaming.
what were you dreaming about?
means when you dream about something that is going to happen.  like one night, i had a dream where this crow came and told me, "your aunt is going to die." i was so scared i woke up my parents. they told me it was just a dream, to go back to bed. but the next morning, my aunt stacy was dead.
that is terrible.
terrible for her, but think about me, young boy with that kind of power. was not three weeks later that the crow came back to me in a dream and said, "your grampa is going to die." well, i ran right back to my parents. my father said, no, gramps is fine, but i could see there was trepidation. and true enough, that next morning my grampa was dead.
because see, my mother was banging the milkman.
no, i understand.
he was slipping her a little extra cream.
he was buttering her rolls. pumping her churn. splashing milk in her box.
stop.
they were squeezing the cheese. clanking the bottles. licking the popsicle.
spooning the sherbet.
can i take your picture?
you do not need a picture. just look up handsome in the dictionary.
please?
that is because we did not have a wedding. your mother-in-law was never supposed to marry me. she was engaged to somebody else.
i never knew.
will never told you that?  probably just as well. he would have told it all wrong anyway. all the facts and none of the flavor.
oh, so this is a tall tale?
well, it is not a short one.
great, great. that is fantastic.
it was on that night karl met his destiny. and i met mine. almost.
hey kid! your friend just made himself a star.
that is great.
see! the big guy likes it.
i just saw the woman I am going to marry, i know it. but then i lost her.
tough break. most men have to get married before they lose their wives.
I am going to spend the rest of my life looking for her. that or die alone.
jesus, kid.  let me guess. real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
yes!
i know her uncle. friends of the family.
who is she? where does she live?
kid. do not waste your time. she is out of your league.
what do you mean? you do not even know me.
sure i do. you were hot shit back in hickville, but here in the real world, you got squat. you do not have a plan. you do not have a job. you do not have anything but the clothes on your back.
I have got a whole backpack full of clothes!
someone stole my backpack.
kid, you were a big fish in a small pond. this here is the ocean, and you are drowning. take my advice and go back to puddleville. you will be happy there.
i do not have a job, but i would have a job if you gave me one. and i may not have much, but i have more determination than any man you are ever going to meet.
sorry, kid. i do not do charity.
I will work night and day, and you will not have to pay me. you just have to tell me who she is.
did not kill anything, did i?
a few rabbits, but i think one of them was already dead.
that would explain the indigestion.
i was wrong about you kid. you may not have much, but what you got, you got a lot of. you could get any girl.
there is only one i want.
her name is sandra templeton. she is going to auburn. the semester's almost over, so you better hurry.
thank you.
good luck, kid.
I am sorry.
do not need to apologize to me. i mean, I am the luckiest person you are going to find today...
oh.
but you are wrong. i do know you, at least by reputation. edward bloom from ashton. see, I am actually engaged to a boy from ashton. don price. he was a few years older than you.
daffodils?
they are your favorite flower.
how did you get so many?
i called everywhere in five states and explained this was the only way i could get my wife to marry me.
you do not even know me.
i have the rest of my life to find out.
bloom!
don.
what the hell are you doing? this is my girl. mine!
i did not know she belonged to anybody.
how can i convince you to stop?
go out with me.
i thought you said you did not have a church wedding.
well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
is it the medicine that is making you thirsty?
truth is, I have been thirsty my whole life. never really known why.
there was one time when i was eleven...
you were talking about your wedding.
i did not forget. i was just working on a tangent. see, most men, they will tell a story straight through, and it will not be complicated, but it will not be interesting either.
i like your stories.
and i like you.
i talked with your father last night.
did you?
you never told me how your parents met.
they met at auburn.
what about the details? how they fell in love. the circus. the war. you never told me any of that.
that is because most of it never happened.
but it is romantic.
mmm.
mmm, what?
mmm, what. i know better than to argue romance with a french woman.
do you love your father?
everyone loves my father. he is a very likeable guy.
do you love him?
you have to understand. when i was growing up, he was gone more than he was here. and i started thinking -- maybe he has a second life somewhere else. with another house, another family. he leaves us, he goes to them. or maybe there is no family. maybe he never wanted a family. but whatever it is, maybe he likes that second life better. and the reason he tells all those stories is because he can not stand this boring place.
but it is not true.
what is "true?" I have never heard my father say a single true thing.
look, i know why you like him. i know why everyone likes him. but i need you to tell me I am not crazy.
you are not.
i need you on my side.
i am always on your side. and i think you should talk to him.
did i ever tell you about how...
yes.
the maple tree and the buick. we heard it.
i think someone hasn't.
but the real story is how i got the car. you see...
dad?
son?
can we talk?
I am going to get started on dishes.
I will help you.
do you know much about icebergs, dad?
do i? i saw an iceberg once. they were hauling it down to texas for drinking water, only they did not count on an elephant being frozen inside. the woolly kind. a mammoth.
dad!
what?
I am trying to make a metaphor here.
then you should not have started with a question. because people want to answer questions. you should have started with, "the thing about icebergs is..."
the thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. the other 90 percent is below the water where you can not see it. and that is what it is with you dad. I am only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
what, you are seeing down to my nose? my chin?
i have no idea who you are because you have never told me a single fact.
I have told you a thousand facts. that is all i do, will. i tell stories.
you tell lies, dad. you tell amusing lies. stories are what you tell a five-year old at bedtime. they are not elaborate mythologies you maintain when your son is ten and fifteen and twenty and thirty. and the thing is, i believed you. i believed your stories so much longer than i should have. and then when i realized that everything you said was impossible -- everything! -- i felt like such a fool to have trusted you. you were like santa claus and the easter bunny combined. just as charming and just as fake.
you think I am fake.
only on the surface. but that is all I have ever seen.
dad, I am about to have a kid of my own here. it would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
it would kill you, huh?
what do you want, will? who do you want me to be?
yourself. good, bad, everything. just show me who you are for once.
i have been nothing but myself since the day i was born. and if you can not see that, it is your failing, not mine.
that really happened?
not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
I am going to check on him.
i need to lie down for a bit.
it is me. norther winslow.
i was astonished to see the greatest poet of both ashton and spectre all the way out in texas.
i do not believe it!
i want you to know, when you left spectre it opened my eyes. there was a whole life out there that i was not living. so i travelled. i saw france, and africa, half of south america. every day a new adventure, that is my motto.
that is great, norther. I am happy for you. i can not believe i helped.
so what are you up to now?
I am robbing this place.
this is it? the whole vault.
'fraid so.
edward, it is got your deposit slip on it.
i was drying out.
i see. we need to get you one of those plant misters. we can spray you like a fern.
is he awake?
he just fell asleep. josephine's with him.
mom?
yes?
did you and dad have any other property?
i suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. but we sold that right away. your cousin shirley bought it.
so you never bought any land.
heavens no. we had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
oh. oh.
hello.
i was not expecting you.
are you jenny hill?
i am. and you are will. I have seen your picture, that is how i recognize you. i almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  like this.
how did you know my father?
this was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. everyone in town knew him.
were you and my father having an affair?
wow. wow, you just said it. i was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
I have seen him with women. he flirts. he always has. on some level, i presumed he was cheating on my mother. i just never had proof.
can i ask you a question? why did you come here today? if you found this deed, why did not you just ask eddie?
because he is dying.
look, i do not know how much you want to know about any of this. you have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. especially this late in the game.
my father talked about a lot of things he never did, and I am sure he did a lot of things he never talked about. I am just trying to reconcile the two.
you must be edward bloom.
how did you know?
no one would come out here unless they had business. and no one would have business with me except for you. you are buying the town.
apparently I have overlooked this one piece of it, and I would like to remedy that. you see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
so I have heard.
I will offer you more than it is worth. and you know you will not have to move. nothing will change except the name on the deed, you have my word.
in so many words, yes.
then i do not think so mr. bloom. if nothing is going to change, I would just as soon it not change in the way it has not been changing all this time.
it is not like you are going to lose anything. you can ask anyone in town. I have been nothing if not generous. i want the best for everyone.
helping people makes me happy.
I am not convinced you should be happy.
I am sorry. have i offended you?
you are beamen's daughter. your last name is different.  you married.
i was 18. he was 28. turns out that was a big difference.
i will not be selling you this house, mr. bloom.
i see. i thank you for your time.
it is okay, just leave it.
i can get it. i can just...
lord, I am sorry i...
please. go. just go.
i'll...
go.
don't. do not be embarrassed. i should never have let you think that...  i am in love with my wife.
i know.
and from the moment i saw her until the moment i die, she is the only one.
lucky girl.
I am sorry, jenny. i am.
logically, you could not be the witch, because she was old back when he was young.
no, it is logical if you think like your father. see, to him, there is only two women: your mother and everyone else.
you did not become crazy.
well, therapy. and one day i realized i was in love with a man who could never love me back. i was living in a fairy tale.
what happened?
your father had a stroke. he is upstairs with your mom and dr. bennett.
is he going to be okay?
i do not suppose one of us could stay with him. in case he...  in case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
I will stay. why do not you go home with josephine and I will stay tonight.
that is okay?
mom, do you want some time with dad?
yes. thank you.
I am sorry. it seems every hour i have to...
i know. it was the same when i was carrying will. like clockwork.
do you like it, being pregnant?
i do.
i loved it. it sounds peculiar, but i loved every minute of it. i did. eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but i felt like i always had a piece of him with me. a little part of his soul inside me. i could feel it. it was alive and kicking.
glad to see you are not trying to have a heartfelt talk. it is one of my greatest annoyances, when people talk to those who can not hear them.
my father and i have an advantage. we never talk.
how long have you known my father?
thirty years. maybe more.
how would you describe him?
five-eleven. one-eighty. regulated hypertension.  how would his son describe him?
did your father ever tell you about the day you were born?
a thousand times. he caught an uncatchable fish.
not that one. the real story. did he ever tell you that?
no.
your mother came in about three in the afternoon. her neighbor drove her, on account of your father was on business in wichita. you were born a week early, but there were no complications. it was a perfect delivery. now, your father was sorry to miss it, but it was not the custom for the men to be in the room for deliveries then, so i can not see as it would have been much different had he been there. and that is the real story of how you were born.
the river.
the river?
tell me how it happens.
how what happens?
how i go.
i can try, dad. if you help. just tell me how it starts.
like this.
okay. okay.
let's get out of here.
somehow, you are better. different. you are getting ready to go. and i say...
where are we headed?
you say...
the river!
it is unbelievable.
story of my life.
you become what you always were. a very big fish.  and that is the way it happens.
yes. exactly.
