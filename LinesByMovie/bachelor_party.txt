you are late again, rick.
i know, sister, but i have a very good excuse.
there can be no excuse for tardiness.
you are absolutely right. i should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I am just weak, sister; I am so weak.
sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? if you do, why do not you give me a call. I am in the book.
get going, rick... you are late enough as it is.
right... think it over.
how are we doing? my name is o'neill. and you are...?
klupner.  mrs. klupner.
mrs.?
I am separated.
then there is a god. why do not we take that baby picture.
I am getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. could you undo a few buttons?
of course.
where did she go?
she probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. o'neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... i have major news to announce.
hey, you guys, what is going on?
we are going for a little liquid refreshment.
great. I will go with you. wait a second. hey, raul! move that car, will you?
I am glad you guys came by... what is the occasion?
rick's got an important announcement to make.
yeah. what is it?
I have decided not to run for president.
too bad, man, that blows my chance to be ambassador to france.
screw you... screw that... do not jerk me around. you promised me 1500 seats for the police concert... 1500, not fifteen!... screw that... screw you -- screw sting.  hi, guys.
gary, you are quite an animal.
screw you...
let's go.
is not he incredible, gets along with everybody.
okay... we are all here. rick, what is the big announcement?
all right, gentlemen, I am not going to sugar-coat this thing. I have known you guys since grade school, so I am going to give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
man, you are losing your audience.
okay... this is it... I am getting married.
what?
you are kidding.
yes, gentlemen. saturday after next, i lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
hey, man, congratulations!
wait a minute. you been living with debbie! why do you want to get married?
because i love her. what can i tell you?
yeah, man. let's throw a bachelor party with drugs, booze and broads.
yeah. right. all the things that make life worth living.
sounds swell... I am really touched. and my getting married's not going to change a thing between me and my pals. we are still going to go bowling on tuesdays, play cards on fridays and wear women's clothes on sunday night. i love you guys... i always will.
let's have a toast.
debbie... i do not believe it. I am so excited.
bobbie, what are you talking about?
o'neill just tole me. it is sooo great... i do not believe it.
what is happening?
debbie's marrying rick.
...really?
does cole know about this?
really -- you went with him for two years.
he still thinks I am going with him. I am going to break the news to him tomorrow.
he is not going to be happy. and your parents can not be too thrilled either.
no. as far as they are concerned the only good rick is a dead rick. but i do not care... it is my decision.
I am totally blown away. you are getting married. it seems like only yesterday i showed you how to have oral sex.
deb, i want to throw you a shower.
god, you are a slob.
but a fabulous cook.
what are we having?
it is either meatloaf, swiss steak or charred flesh. i will not know till it is finished.
i think your dinner's burning.
do not worry... it is supposed to do this.
want to hear something great? bobbie and phoebe are throwing me a shower. it is really going to be fun.
not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
you are going to have a bachelor party?
of course. I am a traditional guy... it is a traditional event.  well, what do you think?
it looks awful.
yes, but looks are deceiving...  not in this case, however.
are you going to have women at your party?
no, sweetheart, it is a stag party. does stay home.
I am not talking about does. I am talking about hookers.
oh, those. why do you ask?
because from what I have heard, it is a tradition and you are a traditional guy.
cole?
over here, deb... in the smokehouse.
cole, we have got to talk.
finally realized rick's a jerk, huh?
no, cole, i...
it is all right, i forgive you. I am not the vengeful type. we will forget what happened. why do not we take a trip together? maybe kill a few lions in kenya over christmas.
cole, listen to me... I have got to tell you...
you know, when you dumped me for that wimp, i thought, cole, she will be back. god wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
cole, I am marrying rick.
you are marrying him? then why are you coming back to me?
I am not. i just thought i should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
you know how that makes me feel, deb? wanta know how that makes me feel?  angry, deb.  yesss, that is the word, angry. but if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. i want you to be happy, deb.  no matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. be happy, deb. be oh, so very, very happy.
cole, I am sorry, i...
that is all right, deb. go be happy and smile a lot, deb. do it for me.
I am going now, cole.
i understand, deb. 'bye... be happy.
you always were sneaky, stan, very sneaky.
rick, marriage will be good for you. it is done wonders for me.
true, you are a lot handsomer now. do not you have enough blood already?
you will not miss a thing about being single... the wild parties, the different girls every night, running around like a maniac... god, i miss that.
stan, you are depressing me... hey, i did not know you were going to fill 'er up. just take a couple of gallons, okay?
that is an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
okay, rick, all finished. i can not wait for that bachelor party... i need the action.
oops!
all right, who serves?
rick, hit the ball easier, son. you do not have to kill it.
can not i just maim it a little?
er... perhaps we ought to stop now.
no. let's at least finish the set.
well, i have to admit my game's a little rusty, but i love polo. it is unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. really a beautiful experience.
rick, i want to cut through the b.s.
I would love that.
good. i think you are an asshole. no, let me correct that, an immature asshole. which is fine, except you are marrying my daughter and I am afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
mr. thomerson, i...
let me finish. debbie's an adult. she can do what she wants. but if you want your marriage to last, you are going to have to change some things about yourself. if i may make some suggestions...
feel free.
first, you are a slob. you have to dress for success. second, your outlook on life...
I am using the same caterer for the shower i had for our christmas party last year.
great, mom.
if i were you, I would worry less about the shower and more about rick's bachelor party.
ilene, why would i want to do that? i trust rick.
of course you do. i trusted my ex, mel, too. cousin, i can only talk from experience. what do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
ilene, rick promised...
debbie, do not be naive. men are pigs.
girls, why do not we go inside for lunch.  boys, would you mind bringing in that lemonade?
in a second...  and you are irresponsible. show some initiative, try to better yourself, stop showing off, actions speak louder than words.
hi, everybody. am i late?
not at all. we are just finishing lunch.
and...
bond... james bond.
so, cole, you been practicing your game?
sure have...
why is cole here?
you know your father enjoys his company.
nice shot.
thank you, sir.
i know you are as unhappy as i am about debbie's marriage to rick.
yes, sir, i am.
cole, i do not want you to give up on her.
I have tried to change her mind.
it is not her mind you need to change. it is disneyland head in there.
but how can i do that?
if it were me, I would reason with him first. then, if that failed...  ...i'd take more persuasive action.
thanks for the advise, sir.
keep me informed.
the thought of that person marrying my daughter makes me want to upchuck.
you can tell a man by his friends.
cole. do not you know it is bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
i want debbie.
cole...
you dump her and I will give you cash.
what is debbie's blue book value right now?
five thousand dollars.
no.
seventy-five hundred.
not interested.
okay, ten thousand plus a g.e. toaster oven, a litton microwave, a cuisinart...
I am marrying debbie.
michelin tires... brand new. a set of sears best metric tools...
what is this person's story here?
thanks, dad.  cole, go away.
he is going to hurt you, debbie. he will never be true to you the way i would.
thank you. we will all keep that in mind. 'bye now.
huh? wha...
i can not sleep.
oh... i got something for that.
stop fooling around... i need to talk.
what is the matter?
i do not know... i just feel scared.
about what?
the wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
i think the only think you have left out are our relations with the soviet union. sweetheart, everything's going to be all right.
before or after i have my nervous breakfown?
c'mere.
that feels so great.
good...
um... that is very relaxing.
now, i want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
you sure gary's got this whole party deal together?
yeah, man, he is got us a great room at the hotel and lots of chicks.
i hope so. hundred bucks apiece is a lot of dinero.
what time are we supposed to get to the hotel?
where the hell is he?
knowing larry, he probably missed the flight.
so, larry, how have you been?
just in love with everybody. it is really a beautiful planet. i love you, rick. i love you guys. i love everybody.
i hate her. i hate her guts, the bitch.
larry, you and your wife got problems?
i do not want to talk about it. i love you guys. i love my friends.
you want to share it?
naw, two on a quaalude... bad luck.
right.
my marriage is the worst. all crap. a big pile of shit.
maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
she hates me. it is over. you will see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. you sure you want to go through with it, man?
what do you mean, it changes?
well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we will share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
you better not have too much joy.
would not think of it. because tomorrow...  we are going to the chapel and we're...
gonna get married...
this is it, lady. last stop.
can not i just go with you guys?
sorry, we got men's business to do. it is no place for a lady.
remember, you promised... no screwing around.
did i promise that? i do not remember that...
you are really pissing me off.
okay, i promise... i swear on my mother's grave.
your mother's not dead.
well, if i go back on my word, I will kill her.
have a good time. do not make it too late.
anything you say, ma'am. have a fun shower. use soap.
i love you.
what is the matter?
nothing... let's get crazy!
all right!
when do the girls get to the party?
so we want your best girls, the cream of your crop.
let's see your bread.
park view hotel, room 1002.
they will be up there in a half hour.
okay. nice to meet you both.
are any of those right?
this is the park view hotel. I am the hotel manager. are you looking for someone?
yes, you. we are looking for our room... 1002.
it is on the tenth floor.
what do you know, they moved it. catch you later.
keep your voices down. this is a respectable establishment. we do not go for any funny business here. just then a guy with a moosehead beer hat and two guys in a moose costume pass him and enter the elevator with the boys.
i see what you mean... you are a beautiful guy. and you are doing a damn good job.
what do you think's going to go on at the guys' party?
they will probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. but do not worry about the dirty movies.
what do you mean?
i forgot to tell you. yesterday i found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of o'neill's car.
you are kidding.
nah. everything's cool... i took care of 'em.
where is the women, man? we got to have women.
chulo, one thing at a time.
sex is my one thing. I am good at it.
we will spend an hour with "nymphos without pants"...
olivier's in that, right?
then it is on to the real thing.
denmark makes great nautilus equipment.
I would like to jerk and press those babies.
excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the vatican.
this is not right.
i do not get it, but at least gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
women!
give the guy air. everyone to a neutral corner.
what is going on?
it is true.
this place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
guy paints a beautiful picture.
I am going to see what the hell happened.
looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
screw that.
rick, i want to talk to you.
ah, cole.  i do not remember ordering an asshole from room service.
i do not want any trouble.
oh, come on, just a little.
I am ready to make you another deal.
ooh, be still, my heart.
see that down there? that is my most prized possession. my new porsche.
great car.
the best.
i love that car.
I am very happy for you two.
I will trade you my porsche for debbie. an even swap.
the car for debbie?
i mean it. the car is yours. dump debbie.
gee, guys, what should i do? the car or debbie?
low mileage... handles like a dream.
so does debbie.
shit, shit, shit, shit. my car's gone!
maybe it had something to do.
shit!
jumbo, where the hell are the women?
what are you talking about, asshole?
your whores never showed up.
they left an hour ago, pink nuts.
screw you!
that is it, prick lips.
what are you...
I have had it, numb nuts... how much money you got?
why?
because I am pissed off. now give me your cash.
this is bad public relations. i was planning to do a lot of business with you. but now I am going to have to go elsewhere.
hey. I am sorry. you want girls. I will give you girls.
give him the works.
that is more like it.
are you sure this is a good idea?
look, you heard what those hookers said. they were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
that does not mean it was rick's party.
debbie, men are pigs -- if they can have women, we can have men.
look at that guy. what a hunk.
check out the other guy's buns.
hookers beat you up?
yes.
i did not know you were into that.
guys, i think I would rather stay here.
c'mon, larry. be good for you.
i just want to be alone.
all right. now, there is milk and cookies in the refrigerator. go to bed right after "falcon crest."
ed, we are so glad you could come over at the last minute and judge our little beauty pageant.
my pleasure, al... always happy to help out in a pinch...  excuse me. i better call my service... tell them where i am.
congratulations on your daughter's wedding. who is she marrying?
a real turd.
well... hope she will be very happy.
what can i be doing for you?
you are a pimp?
I am telling you i am, joe.
i want women.
that i got. very good women. they sit on your face, anything you want.
I will take some.
big problem now. soon they go to customers.
i need them for a bachelor party at the park view hotel.
you are being in luck. customers in same hotel. i let you have them at cut-rate price for 45 minutes.
sold. 45 minutes. no problem.
not one minute longer or milt will come for you.
milt?
lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they do not mean.
no, she hates me... i want to end everything here... now.
you okay?
yeah, i guess so.
really?
yeah. i see you are right. c'mon, let's party.
hello?
mr. thomerson.
yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
yes i did.
fine. how is everything going?
not so good. he would not listen to reason. he stole my car... my porsche... i can not find it anywhere...
so, he is playing hard ball. well, two can play that game.  go after him. stop at nothing. you hear me?
what? I am sorry, sir, i can not hear you.
some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
well, tell the asshole to shut up.
right.  hey, shut up. okay, sir.
sorry, i can not hear you. some pin head's yelling...  shut up, I am talking here.  now look, i want you to go back and i do not care what you do. stop that marriage.
rick... debbie is mine. she will always be.
cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
you have had it. I am going to get you.
do not you love it when old friends stop by?
hey, I am starved... let's go get something to eat. we will bring back food for everybody.
I am not really hungry.
c'mon. i insist.
what the hell is that?
my gift to you.
under the table!
the best table in the house.
i think you will enjoy this table.
so long, father.
i do not get it. why did not you go for it just now?
i do not know. maybe it is because i love debbie or maybe it is hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I am not sure.
nah, that is okay. my brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. let's give him a break.
right. give me the will to live. let me go first.
great bathing suit.
i think i screwed that one once.
a strange wang right in my palm.
ilene, we do not really know that.
that is what we are going to find out...
i feel like I am spying on rick.
thanks a lot, that was the best. you are next.
nah, not yet. look, you are my older brother. i need some advice here. what is the deal with marriage? what can i expect?
well, the first month it is great. the second month things calm down a little. by the third month you are looking through your old girlfriends' phone numbers; by the fourth month you are numb; by the fifth month, hopefully the football season starts.
thanks, stan, you have been a lot of help.
what the hell are you doing?
I am trying to slash my wrists.
you are trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
i could not find any razor blades.
well, this is terrific. now you are going to have wrists that are smooth and kissable. just go out there. forget about everything and laugh it up.
ha, ha, ha.
no, have fun first. then laugh. now, forget about marriage for a while. go party.
gary, how we doing, big stallion?
rick, i really think I am in love.
this is cause for celebration. she will probably charge half price for sex from now on.
rick, I am concerned.
about what?
this is your bachelor party. you have not had sex with anyone yet.
get a few drinks into me, we will dance and see what happens.
i got something you can not resist. i have a friend, tracey. she wants to meet you. she loves to please.
oooooo.
right in there, pal.
if I am not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
that is the old rick!
how did it go?
put it to you this way -- you are going to have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
I am proud of you, lad.
who was that?
i do not know.
what is this?
got me.
how 'bout this?
still drawing a blank.
he look familiar?
very.
c'mon. get the hookers in a circle. we better put cochise out of business.
what kind of job? I am a housewife.
quiet, mother.
now, do not get into any trouble.
take care.
how the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
i do not know.
what? i thought you told me you had it all figured out.
maybe i did... i do not remember.
I would love to get you in an operating room. just once.
can you believe how perfect it fits?
yeah. who would have thought they would both be a size 138 regular.
hey, you guys...
who is your friend?
oh... it's... er... the guys from the beer convention. we are bringing them to the party.
great.  i was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
thanks for helping us out, ed. we appreciate it.
any time, al.
cole, my god, boy, what are you doing here? what happened?
the bachelor party's upstairs. they made me get naked. they hung me from the window so high up it was so scary i fell down...
take hold of yourself. what room are they in?
1002.
all right, I will go up there and take care of this myself.  you look awful, son. go find yourself some clothes.
yes, sir.
hi, guys. we brought back a friend.
it is bullwinkle.
how about this, a trojan donkey.
and here's mike's partner, in more ways than one. a gal who does not think happiness ends with primates. the very lovely, miss desiree...
it is my fault. he is dead because... i left those drugs...
it is really not all your fault. i was talking to mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. personal things, you know. made some bad investments. at least now he is peaceful...
welcome, welcome, one and all.
rick!
oh, no!
what are you going to do about it?
what can i do? I am dead. debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
I will stop him... you stall him.
is that all the coke in the place?
that is it.
good.
the end.
no sob story is going to change my mind.
reach out and snort someone.
I am saved. let's party!
deb, we are pretending to be hookers.
right in here. the big show starts in one minute.
let's go.
look, girls -- I will stay behind and hold them off. the rest of you break for it!
ilene, are you crazy?
i know what I am doing... go!
i hope ilene's all right.
i hope those guys are all right.
guess who is here? another surprise guest.
who?
debbie.
my debbie?
what is with her costume?
i do not know... go up to her, make like you do not know her and send her into the other bedroom.
you got it.
do not turn on the lights, sugar.  I will lead you around.
how wonderful. a seeing eye hooker.
why do not you get undressed.
i can not trust you!
c'mon, i knew it was you.
rick, you are lying!
let go of me!
debbie, I am telling you, i did not do anything, hardly.
the marriage is off. now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
i do not want that. i want to be with you.
and i want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
i am committed. i love you.
i do not believe you.
you do not believe me? okay, fine.
see? and these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- i did not want any of them. you... you are what i want. understand?
yes...
great. now, what do you want to do about it?
let's get naked.
you are on.
ebbie. ger... umph... lable...
of course, sir. that explains it. leather is a very good source of vitamin e.
you are all under arrest. open up!
your attention, please. may i be the first to say, it is a raid!
ed... you are kinky!
the phone made me do it!
you have been having strange sex...!
no, brett, i...
it is all right...  so have i.
cole, what the hell are you doing?
she is mine!
he and debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. fourteen movie theaters under one roof. prominent is a sign which reads: "24 hour 3d festival!" cole drags debbie into one of the theaters. the gang runs up to the theaters.
fan out and look for them.
are you okay?
yeah.
this has been quite a night. here's a thought. why do not we go home and give our private parts a workout?
you are so romantic...
