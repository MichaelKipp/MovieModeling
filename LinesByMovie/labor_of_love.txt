yes?
the flowers... they are beautiful.
you thought i sent them?
there was no card.
have i forgotten something?  is this a special day?
it is just a regular day.
it is a special day is not it?
well, I am sure it is not christmas, because you would be worried about how much money we do not have to spend on each other... i know it is not new years, because you would be going on and on about wearing a tuxedo and how much you do not like to dance... and I am sure it is not our anniversary, because i did not find an envelope with a hundred dollars cash on my bureau with a note that says, 'pick out something pretty'... yes -- maurice -- I am virtually certain it is not a special day today.
lizy, eliza... elizabeth bennett...  pride and prejudice.
you are amazing.
it has to be a full character's name.
they called her 'lizy' in the book...  sorry i was late.  my jeep died on the way over from the paper.
they printed your article on, 'dry verses can dog food'... very enlightening.
pulitzer, here i come.
what happened?
never have children.  if they are not a burden to you, they are a burden to someone else.
ellen?
what?
the new store?
honey, i told you.  if it makes you happy, we should just do it.
it is a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
we can do it together.
... love is shown through actions not just words.
what is that?  that is not a fortune... you will be rich... that is a fortune.  what you have is a statement.
what it is -- is the truth.
i do not follow.
is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they do not believe the words anymore.
you do not think i love you?
i want to be shown...  maurice would you do anything for me?
yes.
anything?
what do you want from me?  would i swim across an ocean for you?... would i walk across the united states for you?  yes... yes i would.  you know that.
no i don't.  i do not even know if you would walk across the street for me.
why do you polish that thing all the time?
you are talking to me?
why do you polish it?
a book society award is a very prestigious thing.
why are you polishing it -- in bed -- in your pajamas -- at 11:15 at night?  are you going to show it to someone?
no.
then why?
there is no reason.
exactly.  no reason.  no occasion. it just makes you feel good to do something for it, to express your pride and affection for it some how...  how come you would do that for a piece of metal and not for me?
i do love you... very, very much.
show me.
i will -- i promise.
good morning.
good morning.
is it a boy or a girl?
oh, that is not mine.
i do not have kids.
you should.  children are a blessing from god.  i have four.
you look so happy -- how long have you been married?
forty-seven years.
where did he go?
he is getting my sweater from the car.  i said there was a breeze.  i told him not to go.
may i ask you a question that might sound strange?
yes.
so what is the deal maurice?
pardon?
i mean why the sudden voluntary visit  -- usually it takes gun- point to get you in here...
routine, i assure you.  i just wanted to gage my health.  am i healthy?
yes -- you are.
I am going to ask you a question that may sound peculiar.
i know what you are getting at.
you do?
I have seen it before.
you have?
you are feeling old and you want to start exercising.  a lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  do not feel embarrassed about it.
okay.
you should start slow and easy -- fifteen minutes a day.
no.  how far in one attempt -- what is the farthest someone like myself could walk?
just for curiosity sake that is all?
i do not know -- maybe twenty miles... of course I am not recommending that... if someone like you had to i mean... that is how far they would probably get before encountering serious physical walls.
twenty miles?  i see.
each inch represents 150 miles...
making the grand total?
damn baby, relax.  I am getting to it.  from philadelphia following the route highlighted to pacifica california -- you are traveling an estimated three thousand two hundred miles...
three thousand miles?... how many times does twenty go into three thousand?
what was that?
perhaps there is another route?
this is the route approved by triple a.  even if you followed back roads the entire way, you would still be looking at roughly the same distance...
do not worry baby, it should not take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
by car right?
i want to reach people.  nobody listens to me.  this is my way to reach them.
to reach people, you have to feel something first... you write about the wrong things.  how can you feel for dog food?  the people at the gazette do not respect it, and neither do you.
this is a ghost town.  nothing ever happens.
write from your heart.  that is why the classics are great.
are you firing me?
no.  no... i will not be here for a while.  the store will be closed in the interim.
you going on a trip mr. parker?
yes.
where?
california.
when are you leaving?
tomorrow.
I am walking there kris.
walking where?
california.
the hairs on my arm are standing up... something strange is happening.
i always knew you had good instincts...  goodbye kris.  I will see you when i get back.
walk with me?
you like to take walks?
no.  but i want to take a walk with you.
it is one of those thoughts you keep to yourself.
please tell me.
phileas fogg?
... round the world in eighty days. ... hello kris.
you are amazing... what are you doing mr. parker?
i told you.
you are walking to california?
pacifica, california -- it is a coastal city.
oh, a coastal city.  that is good.
ellen told me that she did not know if i loved her.
she knew you loved her.
she was not certain... i never really showed her.
I am really lost.  what does this have to do with walking?
i said, 'i would do anything for her'... and she did not believe me. i said, 'i'd walk across the country for her'... she did not believe me.
i need to show her how much i love her kris.
why know?
because i should have shown her before... everyday, i should have shown her.
pacifica, california... that is a long ways away.
so I have been informed.
ellen got up every morning and went to the corner store to get me my bread for breakfast... everyday. now that is about a quarter mile each way... 17 years... that comes to about three thousand miles...  and you know what kris?
what mr. parker?
she never ate a slice.
he probably just went somewhere.
where?
for a walk.  i do not know.
what is it?
adelle... maurice is in the paper.
what would you like us to do?
put out a p.b.s.... or whatever it is called.
a.p.b.... he is not breaking any law.  he is a grown man... he can crawl on his hands and knees to china if that is what he wants to do.
sergeant, I am a psychologist and i know the difference between normal whims people have and actions that clearly display psychological problems... my uncle lost his wife and it devastated him.
we are very sorry about that.  some of our men were on the scene of the accident.
i think my uncle is suffering from a condition called mania which is linked with depression.  it is a time when an individual will act over-confident, and will act out impractical, grandiose plans. sometimes these plans can be dangerous.
how long does this... mania last?
a couple days to a few months if untreated.
look, I will see if anyone has spotted him recently.  if i get any information, I will call you.
thank you.
do not wait by the phone.  if he is really been walking this whole time, he is out of our jurisdiction...
i thought we both wanted the same things.
I have changed my mind.
you can not change your mind.
i want children.
you have just decided, is that right?
yes.
ellen, there are two kinds of people in the world --
please not, 'the two kinds of people' speech.
... people that were made to be parents, and people who were not made to be parents... my parents, were people who were not made to be parents but had kids anyway.  i do not want us to be that way ellen.
you can change.
face it ellen, I am not the type of person who reads bedtime stories. but you love me anyway.
do not be so sure.
mine.
are you and your friends planning on driving soon?
are you a preacher?
no, i just do not want anybody dying because i did not say something when i had the chance.
this is indiana -- nothing's going to happen to you.
you need a ride, preacher?
a wife?... did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  crushed her like a bug.  snapped her bones?
that is enough.
oh the preacher's getting angry again...  tell me something.  did she die instantly or did she feel every torn muscle and shattered bone? were you there to help her?  or were you safe at home when the windshield sliced into her face --
I will kill you!
uncle maurice, you are wearing sneakers?
high-top nike cross-trainers with heel support and air-cushioned soles.  they are nasty.
and your store?  what about your new store?  what about all your dreams?
i have new dreams now.
i do not accept that.
maybe one day -- after you have been married twenty years you will understand.
uncle maurice -- i spent all our frequent flyer miles on a one way ticket here... i have a rented car outside, just listen to me.  come back with me now, and if you still want to do something like this in a year -- maybe we will plan a car trip across the country -- gerald and i will come along --
i have to walk -- by myself -- all the way -- every inch.
it is impossible.
it is what she asked for... it is what I am going to do.
she was being symbolic.  what if she asked you to fly to the moon?
you would be visiting me at nasa.
what if you do not make it?
I will make it.
if you really want to do this... plan it out.  rest up.  train for it.  build up your body.  plan every stop along the way.  how much money?  time?  really do it properly.  this is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
no it is not.
why did you take the back roads here?  they are not safe.  you would know that if you would planned.
I have all ready gone six hundred miles... i can not do it again.
if you can not redo these six hundred miles when you are rested and ready, how are you possible going to walk another two thousand-five hundred miles in your present condition?
nothing's going to happen.
uncle, the way i was told, if that police car did not happen down that road, you would be dead right now. that guy denny, had jumped bail in another state, he is dangerous... they will be other dennys, if you do not plan.
it must have hit the window... i think its neck is broken.
do not bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
it is not going to make it ellen. let the poor thing go quietly.
it will make it.
this smells good.
why am i such an authority?
here comes the resume.
i received my b.s. from the university of pennsylvania, my p.h.d. from bryn mawr college.  i worked three years at the boston university school of medicine, during which time i had articles printed in the "journal of educational psychology", "american journal of psychology", "psychology review" and "science"... so i think it is safe to say my opinion is valid.
what is his story?
his name is maurice.  he is dancing around everything else.
red flag, man.
if he is in trouble with the law -- fine.  not our problem.  he yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
red flags man.
not our problem.
why so vague?  why so evasive?  he could be somebody hot.
not our problem.
it is going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the steadman's house.
this guy's not a murderer.
if he is, half the town has seen us take him out for dinner like a couple of jack-asses.
a marriage certificate?  who the hell carries their marriage certificate around?
maurice and ellen parker... it was issued in philly... mr. maurice parker has come a long way from home.  why?
hansen's whipped.  has to call his wife every two hours or she will go ballistic when he gets home.
p-a-r-k-e-r.  right.  get on the horn with philly.  call me here.
this story is big huh?
mammoth.
the gazette's small huh?
what are you saying?  this story is too big for this paper?
umm, no.  it is just that --
god damn, you are right... you do not say much michelle, but what you say is golden.
I am going to drop off tandy at the station and then drop you back.
that is all right is not it?
shit!  he jumped!
jumped where?
out of the car.  he jumped out of the god damn car!
what did they ask?
if i had seen you.  by the way I am sorry about your wife.  they told me.
thank you... I am sorry you had to lie.  it must have been difficult.
i asked the officers if you had committed some crime... if they had said 'yes', you would be speaking with them right now.
to where?
pacifica, california.
from where?
philadelphia, pennsylvania.
i see.
why?
do you believe a person's soul lives on after their death?
most certainly.
and that that soul takes part of the person they were on this earth with them.
that is a reasonable assumption.
i do not want my wife's soul having any doubts.
doubts?  about what?
about my love for her.
you do not have to prove anything to her.
I am not proving to her.  I am showing her.  and i know i do not have to.  i want to.  I have realized, love is about giving. I am alive, i can still give to her. i want to give her everything i can.
well, hello.
I am isaac... I am three.
I am maurice parker... I am much older than three.  are your parents home?
you know what, i can play baseball with my brothers when I am bigger.
is that right?
you know what... I am just little now, but I will be big soon.
you will probably be bigger than your brothers.
yeah!
if that am not fate?... hi, I am dave caldwell.  i do the copy for the anchor on the evening news down here.
evening news?
we did a piece after your story ran in the new york times.
i thought you were asleep.
you know what... i remembered you were here and i woke up.
your parents would want you to be in bed.
you tell stories?
oh no... I am not good at that. very bad in fact...
there was a boy named isaac who wanted to play baseball, but he was too small and no one would let him play... but he kept practicing by himself -- waiting... he went to every game and sat in the stands with his glove.
you know what... maybe i ran onto the field and hit a home run.
who is telling this story?
anyway, big billy needed another player so he yelled into the stands.  'who can play baseball?' and there was a little voice that yelled out, 'me, i can play.' everyone turned to see a little boy standing with a glove.
that is me.
right.  but everyone saw how small isaac was and laughed... but not big billy.  he stared at isaac carefully and then told him to join the game.  it came to the end of the game.  it was the eleventh or twelfth inning or whatever is the last inning of a game...
nine.
okay nine.  big billy's team was losing and he was on base.  that is when isaac came up.  he could barely hold the bat... big billy winked at isaac... the ball was pitched -- isaac hit the ball hard. it soared up and out over the stadium.  everyone cheered.  isaac hit a home run and won the game. after the game, isaac asked big billy why he let he play.  big billy smiled and said, i was not always big billy, i was little billy first... isaac and big billy went off after the game and read a classic book together.  the end.
you know what -- that was a really good story... tell it again.
I have always wanted a watch like that.
it is yours.
no.  i will not take it unless i pay for it... let's see, that is a pretty nice watch -- i can see that.
i really want that watch.
this is not right.
this is my only chance to get a watch like that.  it would mean a lot to me and my family.  please take it.  it really is not that much.
your father?
he is plastered.
that is okay -- really it is.
no it is not.  he should be here with me now, not trying to find some fucking bottle of johnny walker.  he is never been there for me.  I have always been alone.
michelle, breathe... that is it, what is it, talk to me.
umm, coalville utah.
umm, he is going to make it is not he?
maybe.
there are a lot of people worried about you.
where am i?
in a hospital.
which hospital?  did you take me back?
are you two planning kids?
maybe later.
you should definitely have children.  they are really special.
i do not think you realize how serious this is uncle.
how serious is it?
the normal amount of build up in your arteries has been aggravated by over exertion.  this is called, "claudication,"  as a result, there is not enough circulation to your body.  that accounts for the discoloration in your extremities and the muscle spasms I am sure you have encountered.
can it kill me?
it can, but it will have to wait in line.
what steps do we take now?
we operate.  we find the artery in the brain and close the bleeding... i just did this procedure on a senator and he is doing fine.
what are the odds?  do i have a fifty-fifty chance of surviving the operation?
it is hard to say.  it is a delicate surgery.  there is no getting around the fact that it is a very high-risk situation.
then it will have to wait until i finish.
what?
i finish the walk, and then we may take all the chances we want.
listen to me very carefully, because i do not want you to misunderstand me... the walk is over uncle maurice.  done. finished.  you have made it to california, it was a miracle, now let's try to save your life.
I am completing the walk.  I am almost there.
hello, mr. parker.
hello.
how are you feeling?
confused.  I am not sure what to do now.  I am not sure what he wants for me.
he wants to reward you... that is why I am here.
what do you mean?
i mean you have done a great thing. you should be rewarded monetarily.
what is your shoe size?
what?  who are you?
tom joad?
... the grapes of wrath.
you are amazing.
i missed you kris.
i missed you to mr. parker.
adelle told me, your writing is going well.  the crusader for social issues and all.
you were right.  from the heart is always better.
i have not been too punctual with the rent.
i was thinking you could open another store with investors.  I am sure a lot of people would want to get involved with you now.
are they standing?
saluting.
come on mr. parker.
what, come on?
i can not do it.  i want you to finish, but i want you to live more.
we do the operation after i finish. i can not risk not finishing... i thought you understood what i was doing.
i do.
why in god's name did you fly all the way here then?
do not do this.
... to look me in the eye and say what is important to you is not as important to me?  to tell me you know what is best?  to tell me life is more precious than what i feel for my wife?
mr. parker, you can yell at me, if it will help.  but I am not risking your life.
it is mine to risk.
she knows you love her mr. parker. she knows now.
no more words.  until i touch the ocean with my hands... it is all just words.
what do your friends call you?
steph.
do you have a car, steph?
you are in pain.
i need your help.
they told me, you might try to talk me into something... you need to rest mr. parker... it is for your own good.  I have been following your story for a long while.  it is a beautiful thing you did.
you ever lose somebody stephanie?
mr. parker, I am supposed to give you your fish sticks.
... my father.
did you tell him everything you wanted to?  did you do everything you could while he was here?
you are going to have a lot of work to do when i get back.
someone should be with you.
i do not know.
i think it is a different place for each person.
did you have a dream?
i know where my heaven is.
where?
pacifica, california.
why there?
when i was ten, my family lived in pacifica for a year.  i used to go to the beach everyday that summer. i never felt so happy, carefree. it was a magic place for me... that is where my heaven will be.
maurice?
yes.
if i die, you will know where to look for me?
go to sleep ellen.
no really, if god takes us away from each other, you know where to look now?
the beach of pacifica, california.
good.
i have to finish first.
i will not let you die.
