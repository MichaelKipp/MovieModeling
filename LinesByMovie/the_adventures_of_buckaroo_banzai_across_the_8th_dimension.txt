better see what's keepin' the boss, reno.
why me?
so where's buckaroo?
whadda you need buckaroo for?
unscheduled surgery.  he'll be waltzing along momentarily.  what're you doing tonight?
flying to cambodia.
that's why i wear a fifty dollar hat.  was a two hundred dollar hat, i hadda kill you.
bet you say that to all the girls, perfect tommy.
bet i do.
now twenty seconds downrange...perfect tommy, how on earth is buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
she's just a damn road hugger, allison.  plus the man can drive.
see 'em?  they about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. broke my windshield...
the creatures?  they attacked you?  they tried to possess you?
i'm starving...somebody, help.
got a half a tuna sandwich.
same one you had yesterday?
smells fermented.  check in with the institute, reno, see if everything's kosher.
buckaroo, i've done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the jet car drive shaft.
and there's a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
figures.  anybody seen my scope?
anybody we know?
who put this dirty picture in buckaroo's viewer?
buckaroo, you got a minute--?
not really.  this is pretty important.
she wants a picture.
everybody ready?  how do we look?  do we look okay?
i look great.  let's rock 'n' roll.
raise your hand...where?
this is so embarrassing...
somebody get her a mike? can we manage that?  and a spotlight.  what's your name?
penny.  i'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
did you say..."peggy"?
my name is penny. penny priddy.  there i've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  i'm a nobody.
nobody's a nobody.  why're you crying?  what's wrong?
did i say anything was wrong? i just sponged up a little too much vat 69, okay? i'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, i can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause i met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  he offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, i...
he offered you money?
do i look like that kinda girl?  i lost my room this morning.  i don't know where i'm gonna sleep tonight, but i keep going.  what the hell else can i do?  i've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, i'll always have a job.
this song's for peggy.  and all you others out there a little down on your luck.
my name's, penny!  but who cares?
let me go, let me go, you creeps...
everybody okay up here?
pick those up, reno.
i didn't drop 'em.
it's a spittin' image.
doesn't look anything like her to me.
pictures don't lie.
hell they don't. i met my first wife that way.
it's peggy to these eyes.  same nose, same hair.  plus buckaroo thinks so too or else he wouldn't be ready to go make a fool of himself, right?
then what?
vanished. thin air.
doctor lizardo. wasn't he on tv once?
you're thinking of mr. wizard.  this guy's an eccentric genius.
hey, so was mr. wizard.
dr. lizardo's a raving lunatic, perfect tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
have you warned professor hikita?
first thing i did.
the professor and dr. emilio lizardo were actually the first to discover the eighth dimension.  almost fifty years ago.  before buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  but there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and dr. lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  his hair was orange...
and his soul black as the ace of spades.
he went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane.  the professor told us they threw away the key.
hey, any lock can be picked.  so what's he up to?
i'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
the name's reno.  this here's perfect tommy.
where do you hail from, doc?
reno, how's about you take new jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
why me?
cause buckaroo needs me here.
what're you doing here? why're you looking at me like that?
i guess 'cause you remind me of someone i once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
go away.  let me rot?
who were you really trying to kill last night?
you.  like the papers all say.
pretty terrible shot.
was she pretty?
who?
the girl i remind you of.
she was the queen of the netherlands.
it's kinda hard this way.
i'd turn around, but i'm afraid you'd strangle me.
the netherlands.  whew, that's a long way from wyoming.
wyoming? not cody, by any chance?
no.  laramie.  except i was born in cody. how did you know that?  oh, right, sure, i forgot: you know everything.
no, i don't.
having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
which?  the one in my throat.
did you have family there--? a sister?  in cody?
i don't know. i always felt like i did, like there was another me...
another 'you'?
somewhere.  see i was taken away by the priddies when i was a baby.  i was adopted.
adopted.  i should have know. of course. if it was a snake, it'd bit me!
what?  i don't understand you.  i don't understand anything anymore.
who does?  it's a crazy mixed-up world.  just do the best you can with what you have...
running a little late, buckaroo.
let her out. in my custody.
let her out?  she's a killer.
rawhide tells me dr. lizardo escaped...
i'm assigning a couple blue shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
we at the banzai institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
you keep an eye on it.
any time.
go back to the bus and reroute the call.
and try the president's private number at the hospital.  make sure this is on the level. we're busy people here.
any sign of buckaroo?
no!  ditto the professor-
what? a black ship?  where?  a black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
a black thermopod here?  on earth?!  why, john gomez?  why?
where was it, john o'connor? how far back?
i have a radio fix...
that's me. i've been ionized, but i'm okay. i'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the professor!
the deuce you say.  that crate!
what crate?
i think i'm on to something. you and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called yoyodyne.
yoyodyne propulsion systems?  you think they're mixed up in this?
how long you been riding with buckaroo, reno?
nigh on ten years.  been through a lotta scrapes together.
what'd you do before?  can i ask?
government work.  had my own think tank.  got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  seen plenty of it too.  so will you if you stick around.
where's buckaroo?  is he alive?
course he's alive.  he's buckaroo banzai.
buckaroo!  what the sam hill!
careful...don't make noise and don't touch me.  i'm hotter than flapjacks.
what?
i'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. form the eighth dimension, i think.  look...
ever since that phony phone call from the president.  look at this. what is it?
it's your hand, buckaroo.
it's an antidote. a formula.  whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.
antidote to what?  whose disguises?
arachtoids.  from planet ten.
planet 10?
there's a harley behind those bushes.  get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  we don't have time to ask questions. just synthesize it-
what's his problem?
perfect tommy's just threatened by smart women.  can you play that thing?
better than him.
so we'll help.  let's get crackin'!
who're you?
forgive the butterfingers, buckaroo.  casper lindley, knight of the blue shield, at your disposal.  and my son, scooter.
nothing to apologize for, casper.  you've gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  mind if i get on the horn and radio the cavaliers--?  they'll be worried.
all these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in new jersey on the exact same date.
new jersey?
forty-six yoyodyne employees.  grover's mill, new jersey, 11/1/38.
november 1, thirty days have september, april, june, and november...when short february's done, all the rest have thirty-one. october 31st!  halloween!  don't you get it?  orson welles!
you mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
halloween. 1938..."war of the worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live martians were landing in grover's mill, new jersey!  but then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
then that's it!
not here!  no overthruster!
john whorfin will kill us!
you look!  it's not here!
they're arachtoids, buckaroo, from planet 10!
what? how do you know that?
planet 10?  the same planet 10 you postulated beyond pluto, perfect tommy?  the invisible body?
yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the eighth dimension in 1938 at grover's mills, new jersey...
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled orson welles into covering it up!  and then they founded yoyodyne propulsion systems and hid there for...
orson wells?  what about doctor lizardo?
...but he wasn't the real doctor lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the eighth dimension when prof. hikita's lab exploded...
stole his body?  when doctor lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  of course!  what else?
it wouldn't tell us the whole story until you got here.  it wasn't to talk to the head honcho.
it?  who does?
she gotta be kiddin', right? vaporize the whole damn planet--?
you wanna take the chance, casper?
not me. no way.
rawhide, go find out how professor hikita's coming with that formula. mrs. johnson, take casper and scooter, gas up the jet car.
where're you goin'?
to get my guns.
open up or i'll shoot it off.
i'll shoot yours off if i had a gun, you double-dealing casanova!  i thought you liked me for myself.  but why should you, huh?  a jerk like me.
she must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
she was killed, penny.
oh, my.
don't go to pieces.  i haven't got time tonight.
looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
where's my damn ammo?  nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
how did she die?  i wanna know.
you don't wanna know.
yes, i do.  gimme a chance.  i'm stronger than you think.
she was murdered by hanoi shan on our wedding night.
hanoi shan--?  the guy in your comic books.  boss of the world crime league?  supreme commander of the legion of death?  the pivot of mystery himself?  you're putting me on.  he's a cartoon character.
i wish he was.  he's real enough.
never.
i gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-i've got mixed emotions-i don't know if i can handle this.  oh, boy...
i gotta go.  we're on borrowed time.
go where?  where're you going?
please, penny.  you just gotta trust me now.  okay?  and don't panic. because it's gonna be all right.
what?  if we just believe in buckaroo banzai?
yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
believe in penny priddy?
absolutely.
you've got your six guns strapped on.  you're ridding off on another adventure?  oh, my god, it's all real...it really is real.  i should go with you.  please...
it's too dangerous.
that's just what you would say.  this is so unreal.  i'm dreaming...
buckaroo--! sorry--
what is it, tommy?
sam's dead!  someone broke into the jet car! and things are going haywire over at the lab...
stay here, i'll be back.
sure.  i won't hold my breath.
dead.  damnit!
where's the professor?
you okay?
yeah. just grazed me.  the professor's under the floor too...with the overthruster...
you're a welcome sight...
just 'grazed' you, huh?
apache?
arachtoid.
so i was right.  that's nice to know...
we will, old fried, we will.
sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
there's another one we owe 'em.
they're stealing my chopper!
and they got penny!  look!
don't shoot!
world watch one.  direct incoming transmission.
hello, mr. president.  how's my favorite patient?  any tenderness?
that which does not kill us makes us stronger, buckaroo.  what's it like out there in the real world?
not too terrific, sir.  i apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the earth's caught in a crossfire.
you're gonna have to repeat that, i think, buckaroo.
...hit smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, mr. president.
a what?
a thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  these creatures from planet 10 are ready to exploit soviet-american tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
you're quite serious about this, aren't you, buckaroo.  we know each other pretty well, i think.
they're armed for bear, buckaroo.  check out those radiation levels.
john parker, tell them we're doing our best.  stall.
it's whorfin, buckaroo.  line 3.
whorfin?  does he know we're coming?
i'm not worth it, buckaroo! forget me!
penny--?!  are you all right?
these antidote filters the professor's whipped up will let you to see them like i have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. they won't be pretty, nothing personal, john parker.  but just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
they will never surrender.  they will fight to the end.
buckaroo, come in...over.  how does this damn thing work?  can anybody figure this lighter out?
no, sir.  i think the flint...
what's happening with my call to sac?
still no confirmation either from sac or strategic space command.  they report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
jammed--? by who? whom by?
possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  it's unusual, but no cause for alarm.  intelligence reports the soviets are having the same problem.
should we be on code red?
we're waiting for the jet car.  billy's bringing it.
asshole probably got lost.
but john whorfin said kill her.
damn john whorfin--!
what is this thing?  a fighter?
don't look at me, buckaroo banzai.  i failed flight school.
we're going down!  onto the runway!
the door's locked.
i lack the authority, buckaroo banzai.
at least tell them i'm trying!  tell 'em something--!
does this thing have guns, john parker?
boy, i hope so, buckaroo banzai.
pull up!  we did it!  holy shit, we did it!  pull up!
now, buckaroo banzai?
now!
all accounted for?  where's penny?
new jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  quite a guy if you want my opinion.
got a casualty list?
just their side.  what're we gonna do with these people?  they're illegal aliens, the way i figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
and ask the american taxpayer to foot the bill?  no way.  send 'em back to the eighth dimension as soon as we find the overthruster.  it wasn't in penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out...
