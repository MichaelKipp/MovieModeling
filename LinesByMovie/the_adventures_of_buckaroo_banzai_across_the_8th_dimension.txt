better see what is keepin' the boss, reno.
why me?
so where is buckaroo?
whadda you need buckaroo for?
unscheduled surgery.  he will be waltzing along momentarily.  what are you doing tonight?
flying to cambodia.
that is why i wear a fifty dollar hat.  was a two hundred dollar hat, i hadda kill you.
bet you say that to all the girls, perfect tommy.
bet i do.
now twenty seconds downrange...perfect tommy, how on earth is buckaroo able to keep that thing on the ground?
she is just a damn road hugger, allison.  plus the man can drive.
see 'em?  they about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. broke my windshield...
the creatures?  they attacked you?  they tried to possess you?
I am starving...somebody, help.
got a half a tuna sandwich.
same one you had yesterday?
smells fermented.  check in with the institute, reno, see if everything's kosher.
buckaroo, I have done an advanced spectrograph analysis on the specimen you pulled off the jet car drive shaft.
and there is a two-hundred-dollar deductible we have to eat on that crack in her windshield.
figures.  anybody seen my scope?
anybody we know?
who put this dirty picture in buckaroo's viewer?
buckaroo, you got a minute--?
not really.  this is pretty important.
she wants a picture.
everybody ready?  how do we look?  do we look okay?
i look great.  let's rock 'n' roll.
raise your hand...where?
this is so embarrassing...
somebody get her a mike? can we manage that?  and a spotlight.  what is your name?
penny.  I would rather not reveal my last name or my age.
did you say..."peggy"?
my name is penny. penny priddy.  there I have said it, but it will not mean anything to you.  I am a nobody.
nobody's a nobody.  why are you crying?  what is wrong?
did i say anything was wrong? i just sponged up a little too much vat 69, okay? I am down to my last nickel in this lousy town, i can not get my luggage outta hock 'cause i met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  he offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, i...
he offered you money?
do i look like that kinda girl?  i lost my room this morning.  i do not know where I am going to sleep tonight, but i keep going.  what the hell else can i do?  I have still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there is a sidewalk, I will always have a job.
this song's for peggy.  and all you others out there a little down on your luck.
my name's, penny!  but who cares?
let me go, let me go, you creeps...
everybody okay up here?
pick those up, reno.
i did not drop 'em.
it is a spittin' image.
does not look anything like her to me.
pictures do not lie.
hell they don't. i met my first wife that way.
it is peggy to these eyes.  same nose, same hair.  plus buckaroo thinks so too or else he would not be ready to go make a fool of himself, right?
then what?
vanished. thin air.
doctor lizardo. was not he on tv once?
you are thinking of mr. wizard.  this guy's an eccentric genius.
hey, so was mr. wizard.
dr. lizardo's a raving lunatic, perfect tommy, a vicious psychopath with crazy eyes and flaming orange hair that once upon a time was mousy brown like yours.
have you warned professor hikita?
first thing i did.
the professor and dr. emilio lizardo were actually the first to discover the eighth dimension.  almost fifty years ago.  before buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  but there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and dr. lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he was not the same guy.  his hair was orange...
and his soul black as the ace of spades.
he went on a senseless crime spree, killed a cop during a bank robbery, got caught and judged insane.  the professor told us they threw away the key.
hey, any lock can be picked.  so what is he up to?
I am sure we will find out soon enough.
the name's reno.  this here's perfect tommy.
where do you hail from, doc?
reno, how is about you take new jersey's gear, mosey on over to the bus and introduce him to the rest of the hands.
why me?
cause buckaroo needs me here.
what are you doing here? why are you looking at me like that?
i guess 'cause you remind me of someone i once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
go away.  let me rot?
who were you really trying to kill last night?
you.  like the papers all say.
pretty terrible shot.
was she pretty?
who?
the girl i remind you of.
she was the queen of the netherlands.
it is kinda hard this way.
I would turn around, but I am afraid you would strangle me.
the netherlands.  whew, that is a long way from wyoming.
wyoming? not cody, by any chance?
no.  laramie.  except i was born in cody. how did you know that?  oh, right, sure, i forgot: you know everything.
no, i don't.
having a little trouble with that knot, are not you?
which?  the one in my throat.
did you have family there--? a sister?  in cody?
i do not know. i always felt like i did, like there was another me...
another 'you'?
somewhere.  see i was taken away by the priddies when i was a baby.  i was adopted.
adopted.  i should have know. of course. if it was a snake, it would bit me!
what?  i do not understand you.  i do not understand anything anymore.
who does?  it is a crazy mixed-up world.  just do the best you can with what you have...
running a little late, buckaroo.
let her out. in my custody.
let her out?  she is a killer.
rawhide tells me dr. lizardo escaped...
I am assigning a couple blue shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
we at the banzai institute have at last found that way: an alternating gradient synchronizer that softens solid matter by attenuating its electroweak forces!
which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
you keep an eye on it.
any time.
go back to the bus and reroute the call.
and try the president's private number at the hospital.  make sure this is on the level. we are busy people here.
any sign of buckaroo?
no!  ditto the professor-
what? a black ship?  where?  a black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
a black thermopod here?  on earth?!  why, john gomez?  why?
where was it, john o'connor? how far back?
i have a radio fix...
that is me. I have been ionized, but I am okay. i'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
buckaroo, somebody shanghaied the professor!
the deuce you say.  that crate!
what crate?
i think I am on to something. you and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called yoyodyne.
yoyodyne propulsion systems?  you think they are mixed up in this?
how long you been riding with buckaroo, reno?
nigh on ten years.  been through a lotta scrapes together.
what did you do before?  can i ask?
government work.  had my own think tank.  got tired of thinking-wanted some action.  seen plenty of it too.  so will you if you stick around.
where is buckaroo?  is he alive?
course he is alive.  he is buckaroo banzai.
buckaroo!  what the sam hill!
careful...don't make noise and do not touch me.  I am hotter than flapjacks.
what?
I am a giant semi-conductor, and there is alien creatures all around us. form the eighth dimension, i think.  look...
ever since that phony phone call from the president.  look at this. what is it?
it is your hand, buckaroo.
it is an antidote. a formula.  whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.
antidote to what?  whose disguises?
arachtoids.  from planet ten.
planet 10?
there is a harley behind those bushes.  get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula.  we do not have time to ask questions. just synthesize it-
what is his problem?
perfect tommy's just threatened by smart women.  can you play that thing?
better than him.
so we will help.  let's get crackin'!
who are you?
forgive the butterfingers, buckaroo.  casper lindley, knight of the blue shield, at your disposal.  and my son, scooter.
nothing to apologize for, casper.  you have gone beyond the call of duty tonight.  mind if i get on the horn and radio the cavaliers--?  they will be worried.
all these people applied for drivers' licenses in the same town in new jersey on the exact same date.
new jersey?
forty-six yoyodyne employees.  grover's mill, new jersey, 11/1/38.
november 1, thirty days have september, april, june, and november...when short february's done, all the rest have thirty-one. october 31st!  halloween!  do not you get it?  orson welles!
you mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
halloween. 1938..."war of the worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live martians were landing in grover's mill, new jersey!  but then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
then that is it!
not here!  no overthruster!
john whorfin will kill us!
you look!  it is not here!
they are arachtoids, buckaroo, from planet 10!
what? how do you know that?
planet 10?  the same planet 10 you postulated beyond pluto, perfect tommy?  the invisible body?
yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the eighth dimension in 1938 at grover's mills, new jersey...
...where there was some kinda giant crash landing, a huge explosion and they fooled orson welles into covering it up!  and then they founded yoyodyne propulsion systems and hid there for...
orson wells?  what about doctor lizardo?
...but he was not the real doctor lizardo...just this arachtoid creep that stole the good doc's body the year before in the eighth dimension when prof. hikita's lab exploded...
stole his body?  when doctor lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped?  of course!  what else?
it would not tell us the whole story until you got here.  it was not to talk to the head honcho.
it?  who does?
she got to be kiddin', right? vaporize the whole damn planet--?
you wanna take the chance, casper?
not me. no way.
rawhide, go find out how professor hikita's coming with that formula. mrs. johnson, take casper and scooter, gas up the jet car.
where are you goin'?
to get my guns.
open up or I will shoot it off.
I will shoot yours off if i had a gun, you double-dealing casanova!  i thought you liked me for myself.  but why should you, huh?  a jerk like me.
she must have been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
she was killed, penny.
oh, my.
do not go to pieces.  i have not got time tonight.
looks like you are the one might go to pieces.
where is my damn ammo?  nothing is ever where it is supposed to be around here!
how did she die?  i wanna know.
you do not wanna know.
yes, i do.  gimme a chance.  I am stronger than you think.
she was murdered by hanoi shan on our wedding night.
hanoi shan--?  the guy in your comic books.  boss of the world crime league?  supreme commander of the legion of death?  the pivot of mystery himself?  you are putting me on.  he is a cartoon character.
i wish he was.  he is real enough.
never.
i got to be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-i've got mixed emotions-i do not know if i can handle this.  oh, boy...
i got to go.  we are on borrowed time.
go where?  where are you going?
please, penny.  you just got to trust me now.  okay?  and do not panic. because it is going to be all right.
what?  if we just believe in buckaroo banzai?
yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
believe in penny priddy?
absolutely.
you have got your six guns strapped on.  you are ridding off on another adventure?  oh, my god, it is all real...it really is real.  i should go with you.  please...
it is too dangerous.
that is just what you would say.  this is so unreal.  I am dreaming...
buckaroo--! sorry--
what is it, tommy?
sam's dead!  someone broke into the jet car! and things are going haywire over at the lab...
stay here, I will be back.
sure.  i will not hold my breath.
dead.  damnit!
where is the professor?
you okay?
yeah. just grazed me.  the professor's under the floor too...with the overthruster...
you are a welcome sight...
just 'grazed' you, huh?
apache?
arachtoid.
so i was right.  that is nice to know...
we will, old fried, we will.
sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
there is another one we owe 'em.
they are stealing my chopper!
and they got penny!  look!
do not shoot!
world watch one.  direct incoming transmission.
hello, mr. president.  how is my favorite patient?  any tenderness?
that which does not kill us makes us stronger, buckaroo.  what is it like out there in the real world?
not too terrific, sir.  i apologize for the interruption but something very unusual has reared its ugly head in outer space, and it looks like the earth's caught in a crossfire.
you are going to have to repeat that, i think, buckaroo.
...hit smolensk and precipitate a thermonuclear war, mr. president.
a what?
a thermonuclear holocaust, sir.  these creatures from planet 10 are ready to exploit soviet-american tensions and get us to blow each other off the face of the earth, sir, if necessary.
you are quite serious about this, are not you, buckaroo.  we know each other pretty well, i think.
they are armed for bear, buckaroo.  check out those radiation levels.
john parker, tell them we are doing our best.  stall.
it is whorfin, buckaroo.  line 3.
whorfin?  does he know we are coming?
I am not worth it, buckaroo! forget me!
penny--?!  are you all right?
these antidote filters the professor's whipped up will let you to see them like i have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. they will not be pretty, nothing personal, john parker.  but just remember...if we fail tonight, there is no tomorrow.
they will never surrender.  they will fight to the end.
buckaroo, come in...over.  how does this damn thing work?  can anybody figure this lighter out?
no, sir.  i think the flint...
what is happening with my call to sac?
still no confirmation either from sac or strategic space command.  they report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
jammed--? by who? whom by?
possible atmospheric condition, sir...solar.  it is unusual, but no cause for alarm.  intelligence reports the soviets are having the same problem.
should we be on code red?
we are waiting for the jet car.  billy's bringing it.
asshole probably got lost.
but john whorfin said kill her.
damn john whorfin--!
what is this thing?  a fighter?
do not look at me, buckaroo banzai.  i failed flight school.
we are going down!  onto the runway!
the door's locked.
i lack the authority, buckaroo banzai.
at least tell them I am trying!  tell 'em something--!
does this thing have guns, john parker?
boy, i hope so, buckaroo banzai.
pull up!  we did it!  holy shit, we did it!  pull up!
now, buckaroo banzai?
now!
all accounted for?  where is penny?
new jersey brought her back to the bus through heavy fire.  quite a guy if you want my opinion.
got a casualty list?
just their side.  what are we going to do with these people?  they are illegal aliens, the way i figure, been here forty years, you could throw the book at 'em...
and ask the american taxpayer to foot the bill?  no way.  send 'em back to the eighth dimension as soon as we find the overthruster.  it was not in penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out...
