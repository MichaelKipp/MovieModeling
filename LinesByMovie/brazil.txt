deputy minister, what do you believe is behind this recent increase in terrorist bombings?
bad sportsmanship. a ruthless minority of people seems to have forgotten certain good old fashioned virtues. they just can not stand seeing the other fellow win. if these people would just play the game, instead of standing on the touch line heckling -
in fact, killing people -
- in fact, killing people - they would get a lot more out of life.
mr. helpmann, what would you say to those critics who maintain that the ministry of information has become too large and unwieldy ...?
david ... in a free society information is the name of the game. you can not win the game if you are a man short.
and the cost of it all, deputy minister? seven percent of the gross national produce ...
i understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. people want value for money and a cost-effective service.
do you think that the government is winning the battle against terrorists?
on yes. our morale is much higher than theirs, we are fielding all their strokes, running a lot of them out, and pretty consistently knocking them for six. I would say they are nearly out of the game.
but the bombing campaign is now in its thirteenth year ...
beginner's luck.
thank you very much, deputy minister.
thank you, david ... and a very merry christmas to you all.
sam!
jack!
long time no see!
well, since you disappeared up the ladder of information retrieval ... i do not expect to see you slumming in records - what is the problem?
problem? - no problem - yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, I am on security level five now, and mr helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, could not be better, i feel terrifically motivated and job- rewarded -
you sound worried.
me? - if I am worried about anyone, it is you. what happened to you, sam? you were the brightest of us -
what is the matter?
sorry. nothing.  see you - I am going to be late.
you are late.
even later.
sam, your life is going wrong - let your friends tell you - records is a dead end department, no security level worth a damn, it is impossible to get noticed -
yes, i know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful - remember me to alison - and the - er - twins.
triplets.
really? - god, how time flies!
i want to report a wrongful arrest.
you want information adjustments. different department.
I have been to information adjustments. they sent me here. they told me you had a form i had to fill in.
have you got an arrest receipt?
yes.
is it stamped?
stamped?
no, there is no stamp on it. you see! i can not give you the form until it is stamped.
where do i get it stamped?
information adjustments.
perhaps the machine's on the blink! it keeps picking up old films. that can not he right, can it?
it is not the machine. there is a mismatch on the personnel code numbers... ah there we go! that is a b58/732 when it should be a t47/215 ... tuttle ... he should have 31.06, debited against his account for electrical procedures, not buttle.
oh my god, a mistake!
it is not our mistake!
is not it? whose is it?
information retrieval.
oh, good!
expediting has put in for electrical procedures in respect of buttle, archibald, shoe repair operative, but security has invoiced admin for tuttle, archibald, heating engineer
what a relief! i do not know what I would do if you ever got promoted.
do not worry.
but if they did promote you
I have told you before. I would turn it down.
would you really, sam?
really.
you have been promoted.
it is your mother is not it? pulling strings again.
what a bitch!
i just wish you would stop interfering, mother! i do not want promotion. I am happy where i am.
no you are not. jack lint is a lesson to you - he never had your brains but he is got the ambition. you have not got the ambition but luckily you have got me. and mr helpmann. mr helpmann was very close -
mr helpmann was very close to your poor father. he was very close to me. still is. he will take you under his wing at information retrieval. you will like it when you get there.
you are not listening, mother.
i hope you like it. it is very exclusive.
what is it?
it is something for executives.
hello, spiro. merry christmas.
I am sorry but ...
you remember samuel, my son.
{suddenly unctious) oh, but of course ...
we are meeting mrs terrain.
are we?
ah yes, the lady is waiting.
i can not make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. what do you recommend, spiro?
between you and me, madam, today the number two.
thank you, spiro. shirley, what are you going to have?
oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.
a most perceptive choice, madam, if i may say so.  monsieur?
a steak, please. rare.  mother, i need to ...
monsieur. quel numero.
i do not know which numero.
numero, trois.
numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce.
it is too exciting. I have left dr jaffe and gone to dr. chapman.
numero deux, duck a l'orange.
numero une, crevettes  la mayonaaise.
I am sorry alma, i did not mean to sound so ...
that is all right ida ... it is just that he is such an artist. to him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.
numero trois, steak.  monsieur, mesdames, bon appetit.
what were we saying?
this is not rare!
by the way, i saw a wonderful idea for christmas presents at the chemists. gift tokens. medical gift tokens.
really, sam - when are you going to do something about these terrorists?
what? now? it is my lunch hour.
actually, alma, that is one of the little things i was dying to tell you ... sam's been promoted to information retrieval.
mother!
sam ... you have not had dessert.
I am sorry. i don' t want dessert. i do not want promotion. i do not want anything.
do not be childish, samuel. of course you want something. you must have hopes, wishes, dreams.
hello - central services - I am at 579b block l9, northwestern section d - that is exit 1 on green pastures highway at the orange blossom flyover - and I have got trouble with the air- conditioning
thank you or calling central services. am sorry, due to temporary staff shortage, central services cannot take service calls centrally between 2300 and 0900 hours - have a nice day - this has not been a recording, incident-
this is an emergency!
thank you for calling central services. i am sorry, due -
yes, but. I have got to have a heating engineer
thank you for calling cen -
ah ha ... there you are, sam.
what? how do you know my name?
we know everything here. this is the storeroom of knowledge.
then perhaps you can help me. I have lost someone who ...
we know that too. you have come to the right place.
oh, yes. we have got everything here. every bit of knowledge, wisdom, learning ... every experience, every thought neatly filed away.
what? you mean you have got ...
well not exactly. but, if you help us we will help you. the forces of darkness have won the day ... but, tomorrow is another one
what do i have to do.
you must save the day.
hello ... hello ...
hello. mr lowry?
who is that?
put the phone down and your hands up.
what? who is this?
nice and easy now. keep your hands where i can see them.
what is this?  who the hell are you?
harry tuttle. heating engineer. at your service.
tuttle! are you from central services?
ha!!
but ... i called central services.
they are a bit overworked these days. luckily i intercepted your call.
what?
a little precaution, sir. I have had traps set for me before now. there are people in central services who would love to get their hands on harry tuttle.
are you saying this is illegal?
well, yes ... and no. officially, only central service operatives are supposed to touch this stuff ... could you hold these.
... but, with all the new rules and regulations ... unncgh, c'mon, c'mon ... they can not get decent staff any more ... so ... they tend to turn a blind eye ... as long as I am careful.  ... mind you, if ever they could prove I would been working on their equipment ... well, that is a different matter ... up a bit with the torch, sir.
sorry. would not it be easier just to work for central services?
could not stand the pa - ah - we are getting warm -
the pace?
the paperwork, could not stand the paperwork.  over to the left please, if you do not mind sir. hold it there. yes, there is more bits of paper in central services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and i could not even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27b/6.... bloody paperwork.
well i suppose one has to expect a certain amount
why? i came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there is trouble, a man alone. now they have got the whole country sectioned of and you can not move without a form. I am the last of a breed. ah ha! found it!  there is your problem.
can you fix it?
no. but i can bypass it with one of these
are you expecting anyone?
no. wait here.
yes?
central services.
...ervices.
uh - what? - i ...
you telephone, sir.
...elephoned sir.
trouble with your air-conditioning.
...ditioning.
no, not at all. i mean, it is all right. it is fixed.
fixed?
i mean it fixed itself.
fixed itself.
...ixed itself.
machines do not fix themselves.
... fix themselves.
he is tampered with it, dowser.
...ampered. with it, spoor.
i think we would better have a look.
... have a look.
now look what you have done to him.
have you got one or have not you?
not ... as such ...
but we can get one.
it is all right, terry, it is all right, everything's all right.
I am sorry, but I am a bit of a stickler for paper work. where would we be if we did not follow the correct procedures?
we will be back.
...be back.
thank you.
listen .. um ... i do not want to get involved in any of this. but i work at the ministry of information, and i happen to know that information retrieval have been looking for an archibald tuttle, heating engineer. you would not by any chance be -
my friends call me harry. information retrieval, eh? interesting!
what do they want you or?
time to go.
thank you very much. how much will it...?
on the house. you did me a favor. check the corridor.
a cheque.
the refund for tuttle!
tuttle?
i mean, buttle! it is been confusion from the word go! he is been wrongly charged for electromemorytherapy and someone somewhere is trying to make us carry the can!
I have never seen a ministry cheque before.
we have got to get rid of it! there is been a balls-up somewhere, and when the music stops they will jump on whoever's holding the cheque!
send it to somebody else. send it to buttle. it is his cheque.
I have tried that! population census have got him down as dormanted, the central collective storehouse computer has got him down as deleted, and the information retrieval have got him down as inoperative ... security has him down as excised., admin have him down as completed
hang on.
he is dead.
dead! oh no! that is terrible! we will never get rid of the damned thing! what are we going to do?
try next of kin.
next of kin!
there we go. mrs. veronica buttle. what is the number on the cheque?
27156789/074328/k.
problem. she does not have a bank account.
well, that is it! i may as well go and hang myself! this sort of thing could not have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! that was simmons doing! and he and jeffries always sit together at lunch! the bastards!  ow!  perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
you would never get away with it. besides, you can not do that to somebody is refund. it is christmas. there is one more option.
what?
drive out to mrs buttle, give her the cheque, tell her to sign her name on the back, cash it at the corner sweet shop.
here. what do i do next?
call the motor pool and authorise personal transport.
of course, of course. leave it to me. how do i authorize a cheque?
here we are. pink and blue receipts. all you have got to do is sign these and the back of the cheque.
oh god! i think I have broken a bone. what a pathetic thing i am.
here.
that is it.
you are good to me sam.
do not mention it. see you later.
it is a refund ... I am afraid there was a mistake.
mistake?
yes. not my department ... I am only records. it seems that mr buttle was overcharged by information retrieval. i do not think they usually make mistakes ... but, er ... i suppose we are all human.
my husband's dead, is not he?
er ... i assure you mrs buttle, the ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. if you have any complaints which you would like to make, I would be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
what have you done with his body?
um ...
uh ...
he had not done anything ... he was good ... what have you done with his body?
are you alright?
it is you ... it is you ...
mrs buttle, are you alright?
go away.
her name is jill.
what? ...jill? jill who? jill who?
layton.
jill layton ...  you are a very good little girl. what are you doing here?
I am waiting for my daddy.
he will be pleased when he comes home.
is it all right about mrs buttle's cheque?
i delivered it.
can i forget it?
yes.
damn! blast!
what is the matter?
you do not happen to know how i can get around an irq/3 do you?
all information on 3rd level suspects is classified.
i know that.
all enquiries to information retrieval. which is hopeless, of course. they never tell you anything. but come the time they want something from us ...
I have go to accept that promotion to get behind this, have not i?
yes.  no! you can't! you have only just turned it down!
i never signed the form.
i did it for you.
what! shit!
it is what you wanted is not it?
yes ... no ... i don't, know.
what the - ? how did you - ?
emergency procedures.
...ergency procedures.
i have not got an emergency. get out of here.
sign here please.
what is it?
it is a 27b/6, what did you think it was?
what have you got there?
got there!
mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... tuttle
mumble ... tuttle ...
tuttle! ... mumble!  you have had that scab tuttle here, have not you?
...aven't you?
what?
who fixed your ducts?
...your ducts?
i fixed it myself.
oh yeh? where did you get this from eh  out yer nostril?
...yer nostril?
central services do not take kindly to sabotage!
...sabotage!
hang on! wait a minute! you can not just go and leave it like this!
why not? all you have got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, have not you?
...ven't you?
you are putting your talents to very odd use mr lowry - yes, odd use - to pit wits against central services -
...sod you, stupid twit.
er ... thanks ...
it is reply paid.
oh ...  thank you very much, mother, but actually -
you do not have to sing it.
oh, right ...
are not you a bit late? - the party started half an hour ago.
yes, i know. it is the backlog, everybody complains. was it all right otherwise?
yes, it was ... very nice ... thank you.
do you mind if i use your bathroom?
mother? is that you?
of course. is not it wonderful? the bandages came of this afternoon. come and join the fun. everybody's here.
is mr helpmann here?
yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
i want to talk to him.
it seems you are the first person ever to turn down a promotion. he thinks you should see a doctor.
actually, I have decided ...
whatever happened to you?
there was a slight complication. dr. chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. nothing to worry about. he is promised me I will have these bandages off in a ...
actually, there is someone i want to meet ...
i know, i know ...!
here we are! I am going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
i ... uh ...
hello, jack!
you remember alison?
{winking at sam) she does not like me telling anyone but she is pleased as anything really.
er, i knew you looked different.
remember how they used to stick out?
what? - oh, yes - vividly. i used to wonder if they were real.
dr. jaffe has pinned her ears back.
quite, absolutely - i always thought they were false.
mr helpmann!
thanks very much sam.
that is all right mr helpmann. glad to help.
if i can help you ...
well, i ...
sorry ...
your father and i were very close. of course jeremiah was senior to me but we were close friends ... especially after the bombing  and i  keep his name alive at the office every day.
i know he would have wanted me to help you ... and i promised your mother I would take you onto the team at information retrieval. but i gather that ...
mr helpmann. I have changed my mind. I would like to accept the transfer - am i too late?
too late? that is for me to say.
well ... well, i ...
my name is sam lowry. i have to report to mr warren.
thirtieth floor, sir. you are expected.
er, do not you want to search me?
no, sir.
my i.d. cards.
no need, sir
but i could be anybody.
no you couldn't, sir. this is information retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
no, you can not have any more chairs! there is only one left in here now, and i need that to sit on!  oh ... er, sorry. who are you?
sam lowry.
ah, yes, you are the new boy from next door, ha ha!  my name's lime. harvey lime. welcome to expediting.
ah.  would you mind if i borrowed your computer console?
what?
I will bring it back in ten minutes.
you want to take my console into your office?
yes.
I will tell you what .... you tell me what and I will do it for. I am a bit of a whizz on this thing.
alright. there is someone i want to check out. a woman called gillian layton.
a woman eh? i see.
i know her age and distinguishing marks. but i need an address or a place of work or something
this is your dream girl, is it?
what?  look, let me use the console for a few minutes.
you must be joking -  when there is a woman involved - there is no stopping me. now, let me have that sheet.
sod it, it is broken!
you have not switched it on.
oh - yes. look you are putting me off, standing there! go back to your office and I will give you a knock when I have finished.
hey - that is my desk!
gillian layton - suspect s/5173. truck driver! all enquiries, reference officer 412/l - room 5001.  that is what i wanted to know. thank you very much.
jack!!
sam! what a surprise!
are you officer 412/l?
sorry about that ... mr helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations!
thanks. are you officer 412/l?
for my sins. are you settling in alright?
yes, thanks.
terrific. I am really glad you dropped by. unfortunately, i do not have any time right now I have got a queue of customers to deal with - er, why do not we have a drink tonight?
ah ...
what?
i do not want to take up your time now, but i was hoping you could give me some information on somebody. it is a security level three matter and information retrieval records says to refer to you.
ok. come back this afternoon, about four o'clock. if you give me the number of the case, I will have the dossier here waiting.  my tailor,... well worth the investment.
I have got numbers all over these - I am not sure which is the one you want.
layton! oh shit!
what is it?
you clever bastard! i might have guessed. you only moved in today and you are already hot on the bloody trail.
am i?
please, sam, we are going to have to be open to each other on this one. if you make a reputation with this case, it will be at my expense.
how do you mean?
how much do you know?
not much.
enough though, eh?
not really, no.
ok. ok. let's not fence around ... this is the situation. some idiot somewhere in the building, some insect, confused two of our clients, b58/732 and t47/215.
b58/732, that is a. buttle is not it?
christ! you do know it all!
no, no, i don't. I am just beginning honestly. sorry, carry on.
well, your a. buttle has been confused with t47/215, an a. tuttle. i mean, it is a joke! somebody should be shot for that. so b58/732 was pulled in by mistake.
you got the wrong man.
i did not get the wrong man. i got the right man. the wrong man was delivered to me as the right man! i accepted him, on trust, as the right man. was i wrong? anyway, to add to the confusion, he died on us. which, had he been the right man, he would not have done.
you killed him?
sam, there are very rigid parameters laid down to avoid that event but buttle's heart condition did not appear on tuttle's file. do not think I am dismissing this business, sam. I have lost a week's sleep over it already.
I am sure you have
there are some real bastards in this department who do not mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank god there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. we have got the upper hand for the moment, but they are waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they are looking for.
so how ...?
what I have got to do now is pick up tuttle, interrogate him at the same voltage as buttle, to the same meter reading to the last penny, and juggle the books in electrical banking.
what has tuttle done?
we suspect him of freelance subversion.
he is a freelance subversive?
he is a compulsive heating engineer. a maverick ex-central service repair man with a grudge against society. now, fortunately, we are nearly out of the wood, i think. at least we will be when i get this layton woman under arrest.
what is she done?
you did not know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
er ... no.
very smart.
er ... but i would have found out anyway.
yes. I am impressed.
tell me about layton.
she witnessed the tuttle arrest - the buttle arrest - and since then she is been making wild allegations, obviously trying to exploit the situation - she is working for somebody, and she is not working for us.
a terrorist?
but surely, i mean, perhaps she just happened to live above the buttles, and ...
look after that suit, eh. barbara chose it for me.
right. er, you are not going to keep calling her barbara, are you?
barbara's a perfectly good name, is not it?
look, about the layton woman - maybe she is just trying to help the buttle family.
why?
why? hell, not for any reason ...
{baffled) i do not follow you.
out of kindness.
kindness? what is the purpose behind this line of enquiry?
so what are you going to do about her?
get her out of circulation - I have put her on the detention list.
you mean you are going to invite her in so that she can spill the beans inside the department?
well, i ... good point. what do you suggest?
let me try to get to her. I will deactivate her.
what does that mean? i do not want to be involved in anything unsavoury.
trust me. you do trust me, do not you?
of course. we went to school together. you are my oldest friend.
and you are mine.
you are the only person i can trust.
then we would better keep this business just between the two of us.
right! just between as and the security forces.
they were not at school with us.
but, I have already put her on the search and detain list.
take her off the list.
there is no procedure for that until she is been arrested.
say it was a mistake.
we do not make mistakes.
well, I would better get out there and try to get to her before security does. let me borrow her dossier for a while.
er ... alright. for christ's sake do not lose it. here, you would better sign for it.
thanks, jack. I will be in touch.
do you know what you are doing.
trust me.
sam ... we are proud to have you at information retrieval. merry xmas.
but you have stamped this form before! why will not you stamp it now?
you have just said yourself, miss, we have already stamped it. why should we stamp it twice?
you are a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron are not you?
if you say so.
you think these are tits do not you?
ah.
i bet you would like to touch them?
oh.
well don't. you are looking at twenty pounds of high explosive! and if you do not stamp this form I am going to blow the place up!
who are you? let go!
do not look back! act naturally!
how can i act naturally, when you have trying to break my arm?
ow! that hurt!
good!
what are you doing? for christ's sake! get moving!
who are you?
bloody hell! do as i say!
no.
please!
alright! alright! alright! I am information retrieval officer -  dz/015, and I am arresting you for - your own good! now start up and get moving before i hand you back to them!
them?
us. them. i do not know ... just get going.
do not litter my cab!
oh, sorry.
... this is amazing ... for me ... being here with you. i mean, in my dreams you ...
i do not want to hear about your fucking dreams!
oh. but ... look, I am sorry i shouted at you.
why are they all pigs at information retrieval?
i do not know.  hey, that is not a very nice thing to say.
you know, smoking's bad for you.
it is my fucking life.
yes, of course. sorry.
i know you. i saw you through the floor, did not i?
yes. ceiling. why did you run away?
i did not run away. i left the flat.
why?
i did not like it.
why not?
it had a hole in the floor. where are we going?
where are you taking me?
what?
where are you taking me?
ah ... er ... it looks as if you are taking me.
it does does not it?
where are you taking me?
what is going on here?
what does it look like ... I am collecting empties.
ok. what is in the parcel?
what parcel?
it is heavy.
a heavy christmas present.
what are you doing in information retrieval?
looking for you.
no, really.
really.
i mean, it does not suit you.
suit me?
do not you know the sort of thing that information retrieval does?
what do you mean? would you rather have terrorists?
we have got both.
things would be worse without information retrieval.
they could not be worse for the buttles.
why do not you say, no system is perfect.
well, no system is.
say, all wars have innocent victims.
well, all wars do -
who is this war against, sam?
well, terrorists of course.
how many terrorists have you met? actual terrorists?
actual. terrorists? well ... it is only my first day.
look at that - right on time.
what? i thought you were free to come and go as you please.
well, almost ... unfortunately i do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
every day?
turn around!
what?
they will be there waiting.
who will?
security.
you are joking.
no. please. they are going to arrest you.
i thought you arrested me.
yes ... but, this is real. now, stop!
cut it out, sam.
will you please turn back.
get away!
turn!
stop it ... damn you!
i was right! step on it!
let go! we have got to stop!
now you are the one that is out of your mind.
sam ... we can not outrace them. you will kill us!
come on, let's go! let's get out of here!
oh god! what have we done?
we? do not blame me!
it was not supposed to happen like this.
shit! the house is on fire!
"and your children all gone."
what?
"lady bird, lady bird, fly away home, your house is on fire and your children all gone" ... do you think anyone's hurt?
yes.  come out, i know you are in there
this is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
are you still following me?
please, jill ... i love you.
go away.
there are plenty of other safe places. why do not we go back to my flat?
leave me alone!
you have got to trust me. it sounds silly but i know we were meant to meet.
you mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
i vas just trying to help. i decided to trust you. maybe i was wrong. whose side are you on really? who are your friends? who was the man who gave you the parcel? what is in it? it is the only thing you saved from the lorry .... it must he something very special.
i saved you from the lorry and you are not very special.
........... it is a bomb is not it?
oh ... jesus!
I am going to open it!
no you are not!
ah ... hello, mrs terrain. sam lets go of the parcel and pushes jill away. she moves off.
i think that will hold it.  hello shirley. just helping someone tie up a christmas present. how are you?
my complication had a complication, but dr chapman says I will soon be up and bouncing about like a young gazelle. are you buying a christmas present for your mother?
er, yes ...
shirley and i come here regularly. i love romantic lingerie.
lime, i need to use your computer
sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  you seem to have quite a lot to do yourself.
come off it, jack! of course you can check to see if she is been arrested.
I am sorry, sam, I am afraid this whole case has become much more complicated since last we talked.
she is innocent, jack --- she is done nothing wrong.
tell that to the wives of the security men she blew up this afternoon. listen, we have also had a report just in from central services that tuttle has wrecked an entire flat and sabotaged adjacent central services systems - as a matter of fact, in your block. I would keep my eyes open if i were you, sam. bye.
you do not really think tuttle and the girl are in league?
i do. goodbye.
it could all be coincidental.
there are no coincidences, sam. everything's connected, all along the line. cause and effect. that is the beauty of it. our job is to trace the connections and reveal them.  this whole buttle/tuttle confusion was obviously planned from the inside. bye bye.
jack, she is innocent!
sam - we have always been close, have not we?
yes we have, jack!
well, could you stay away from me until this thing blows over.
jill! what are you do ... i mean ... how did you ... are you alright?
yes.
what happened to you after ...
your face ... are you hurt?
no. no. I am fine. i was worried sick about you ... i thought ...
they are gone.
are you sure?
yes.
for god's sake, what is happened?
thermostat's gone. and then some.
... and then some.
what have you done to my flat?
sign here, please.
... ere please.
what is it?
it is a 27b/6 of course.
this is what you get when you have cowboys round yer ducts.
... yer ducts.
i think you have got your t41 crystal inductor wired up to a reverse bobbin- threaded-solenoid-control. it is either that or a new washer.
... new washer.
sign the form so we can get to it.
... get to it.
do not you like parties?
c'mon. we have got to get out of here.
my mother said it would be all right.
she did not say anything about it to me.
well, she is my mother, not yours.
i will not be held responsible.
how long will she he away?
there are some who go to dr. jaffe's clinic who never come back at all.
make yourself at home. do not answer the phone or open he door to anyone. i will not be long.
where are you going?
I am going to pull some strings. it is our only hope.
do not do anything silly.
thanks for the vote of confidence.
take care.
excuse me, dawson, can you put me through to mr helpmann's office?
I am afraid i can't, sir. you have to go through the proper channels.
and you can not tell me what the proper channels are, because that is classified information?
I am glad to see the ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
thank you, dawson.
what do you think? ... is it me?
you do not exist any more. I have killed you. jill layton is dead.
sam, what are we going to do with you? can you hear me, sam?
where is jill? what have you done to her? where is she?!
gillian layton?
yes, you have got to get me out of here. I have got to find her.
i understand, sam, i know exactly how you feel. so i brought you a bottle of barley water.
help me!
i assure you, sam, I am doing everything within my power. but the rules of the game are laid down, and we all have to play by them - even me.
this is all a mistake! do not you understand?!
yes, well, from the department's point of view you are certainly a bit of an own goal, but ...
I am not a terrorist! you must know that! I am not guilty! get me out of here!
sam, if you have been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you have got absolutely nothing to worry about.
please, I have got to find jill.
sam, i think i ought to tell you ... I am afraid she is upped stumps and retired to the pavilion.
yes, it is all a bit confusing but, it seems she was killed resisting arrest.
no, no ... i did that...
jack?... jack?
shut up!
jack, I am innocent! help me.
bastard!!!
this is all a mistake. jack, please take that mask off.
you stupid bastard!
what?
how could you do this to me?
help me, jack! I am frightened!
how do you think i feel? you shit!
jack ...
shut up! this is a professional relationship!
what? ... oh ...
madam ... cut to woman turning, half in flirtatious conversation. it is sam's mother, but miraculously another twenty years younger and ... a parody of sam's dream girl.
sam!!!
mother? ... what ... what is ... you have got to help me ...
not now ... please
