it is going to ram us.
it would not dare.
captain, i implore you. the men are frightened and angry. they want your assurance.
they knew the risks when they signed on. I have come too far to turn back now.
then you run the danger of pushing them to mutiny.
you are awake. I have prepared some broth. it will help restore you.
i'm... dying.
frostbite. gangrene. a simple diagnosis.
are you a physician?
how is it you come to be here?
there is a startling question, coming from you.  I am captain of this ship. we sailed from archangel a month ago, seeking a passage to the north pole.
ah. an explorer.
would-be. I am plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
i heard.
i can not say i blame them. we are trapped in this ice and bedeviled by some sort of... creature.
creature? a... human like creature?
you know of it?
your men are right to be afraid.
then explain it, whatever it is. it could save the voyage. I have spent years planning this. my entire fortune.
you would persist at the cost of your own life? the lives of your crew?
lives are ephemeral. the knowledge we gain, the achievements we leave behind... those live on.
do you share my madness?
madness?
we are kindred, you and i. men of ambition. let me tell you all that i have lost in such pursuits. i pray my story will come to mean for you all that is capricious and evil in man.
who are you?
my name is frankenstein...
do not cry, elizabeth.
are not you?
are you sure it can not hurt us?
nothing can. not ever.
how could all my father's knowledge and skill fail to save her?
it is not ours to decide. all that live must die. it is god's will.
what kind of god is he to will this?
she was mother to me as well. but ours is the job of the living. it is up to us now to hold this family together. we must think of father and be strong for him.  i cannot do that alone.
god took her from us.
he left a beautiful gift in her place. a baby boy. to cherish and love as our very own. your brother
poor william! what indignant tears!
there, there... shhh...
victor, have a care! you will make him dizzy!
the world is a dizzying place.
oh, do give him here! he needs to be comforted and held!
he needs to vent his outrage to the skies! make yourself heard, willie! learning to walk is not an easy thing! why should it be so?
that is the nature of all progress, william. do not let your brother sway you otherwise.
quite right!
do not listen, willie. progress is a feast to be consumed. women would have you believe you must walk before you can run. or run before you can waltz!
give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
elizabeth, really! he is quite mad!
scandalous! what would your dear mother say?
one-two-three, one-two-three, twirl- two-three...
you dance so beautifully together.
and you look so lovely.
smell the air. wonderful.
quite a send-off, is not it?
father's so proud.
and you?
prouder still. you will be the handsomest student there.
I will have to do better than that.
you will.  what do you want, victor?
to be the best there ever was. to push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
I have loved you all my life
all my life I have known.
this feels... incestuous.
is that what makes it so delicious?
brother and sister still?
i wish to be your husband.
i wish to be your wife.
then come with me to ingolstadt. marry me now.
if only i could. but one of us must stay. father's not strong. willie's just a child. who can look after them in your absence? who can run the estate?
only you.
i will be here when you return.
you make me weak.
not as weak as i.
our decision. together.
your decision. for us.
i give you my soul...
...until our wedding night. when our bodies will join.
victor. i love you,
elizabeth. my more than sister.
in science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.  any questions?
but surely, professor, you do not intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.
philosophical?
those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. paracelsus, for one.
paracelsus?
or albertus magnus. cornelius agrippa...
what is your name?
victor frankenstein, sir.  of geneva.
of geneva.  tell me, mr. frankenstein of geneva. do you wish to study medicine? or mysticism?
i was just clearing my throat.
very well then.
i am not mad.
as a march hare.
are you having me on?
of course i am. it pays to humor the insane.
henry clerval.
victor, victor frankenstein.
i know. you have a way of making an impression.
do you really think I am mad?
come now. magnus? agrippa? next thing you know, you will be teaching toadstools to speak.
rich old ladies and their daughters?
can you think of a better reason?
quite a few.
do me a favor then...  ...keep them to yourself.
the entire school heard it. it was not something one could miss.
you are a comfort to me, henry.
what now? writing about it in your journal will not help.
it is a letter to my father.
professor waldman.
victor, explain yourself.
krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
you have a way of provoking his.  I have been watching you. you seem impatient with your studies.
to say the least. i came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. all we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
you disdain accepted wisdom?
no, i embrace it... as something to be used or discarded as we advance the boundaries of what is known.
now you have got him started.
these are exciting times, henry. we are entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. look at edward jenner. he was not content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I have heard this speech before.
but you have not listened, never in history has so much seemed possible. we are on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
preposterous.
i once saw it done, as a boy in canton. my parents were missionaries. the cure was nothing short of miraculous.  I have never forgotten it. been fascinated ever since.
electricity.
it is utterly fantastic! this is the sort of thing I am talking about! we should be learning this!
why? god alone knows what it means. until it has proven value, it is nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. hardly fit for the classroom.
but the possibilities. combining ancient knowledge with new? something like this could change our fundamental views!
it is a thrilling direction to explore. thrilling and dangerous.  nature can be wonderful and terrible. science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. we must proceed cautiously. assess as we go.  what i do on my own time is my own business. the same holds true for you. you wish to expand your mind? fine, do so. you can even join me here, if you like. but not at the expense of your normal studies.
i doubt that decision is still mine to make.
nonsense. tonight you will draft an apology to professor krempe...
"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.
why?
our profession needs talent like yours. destroy your career over an issue of pride? what a waste.
must have been a terrible row.
he was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous...  fellow..."
he always was opinionated.
he set things right with a proper apology... and now they have put him in charge of dissection lab!
re-configure the leads?
numbers four and twelve directly into the nervous system?
you seem to be adapting well to the approved curriculum.
despite the lack of challenge.
victor. he was trying to be gracious.
the strain was evident.
I am quite serious. look at all the charity and clinic work we do. up until thirty years ago, the concept of vaccine was unheard of.
you are saying all disease will eventually be eradicated?
I am convinced. not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
no. but someday.
thank goodness. we would be out of work.
only you would think of that!
somebody has to!
i tell you what we need, my friends. forget the symptoms and diseases. what we need is a vaccine for death itself.
oh, now you have gone too far. there is only one god, victor.
and here's to him. everything in moderation, frankenstein.
nothing in moderation, clerval.
professor?
oh god.
they just caught the man who did it.
he was a frightened soul who acted out of fear and ignorance.
they will hang him all the same.
good. I will be there to hear his worthless neck snap.
keep your voice down. you do not know what you are saying.
it was wrong, henry! it should not have happened! the bastard deserves to die.
you are making a scene!
why waldman? he of all people should have cheated death!
you can't. death is god's will!
i resent god's monopoly.
that is blasphemy!
blasphemy be damned! waldman spent his life trying to help people!
all the more reason for us to continue his work with the poor!
no. he had more important work.
there are sick people who need our help. here and now. not in some future time. consider that.
victor. this has got to stop.  nobody's seen you in months. you have not attended a single class.
I have been preoccupied.
we all know how hard you took waldman's death. even krempe is sympathetic. but it is time to move on. it is time to concern yourself with life.
that is my concern.  I am involved in something just now. i want to finish it in waldman's memory.
how much longer?
few months perhaps. I am gathering the raw materials even now.
nothing. still nothing.
it is been months. it is not like him.
something is wrong. i know it.  I have heard rumors of cholera spreading south from hamburg.
so have i
i should go. i should leave today.
elizabeth. if it is true, travel into germany would be banned. you would never get near ingolstadt.  besides, they are only rumors.
and not a word of them to father. he is agitated enough not hearing from victor.
read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. we will say it came today. it will set his mind at ease.
this is a bad time, henry. I am busy just now. what do you want?
things have gone worse with this cholera outbreak. thousand new cases a day now. classes have been suspended. university's shut down.
yes? and?
listen to what I am saying. the militia's arriving to quarantine the city. most of us are getting out while we still can.
you will be leaving then.  just as well. you never were cut out for this, henry. goodbye.
thank god your fever broke.  slowly, now. just a sip.  I have been worried we might lose you. it is been touch-and-go for a week.
a... week?
we feared cholera. turned out to be pneumonia, brought on by nervous exhaustion and some idiot running around in a storm.
is that your diagnosis?
mine and professor krempe's.  we have been trading off nursing you in shifts. the rest of the time we are out working with the cholera victims. it is his turn for that just now.
you have been going round-the-clock?
we catch a few hours sleep where we can. usually here at your bedside.
everything in moderation, clerval.
nothing in moderation, frankenstein.
it is the down-and-outs i pity most. those who can not fend for themselves. they will be dead by the thousands before this is done. they do not stand a chance out there.
no. they don't.
victor. this place looked like a charnel house. what went on here?
nice.
the music? or the fire?
I am glad you finally came to the door. a man should not have to scurry in the shadows.
better that way... for me.
why?
i'm... very, very ugly. people are afraid. except you.
it can not be as bad as that.
worse.
you are an outcast.
yes. i have been seeking my friends.
friends? do they live around here?
yes. very close
why do you not go to them?
i have been... afraid. afraid... they will hate me... because i am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful
people can be kinder than you think.
i am afraid.
what does it say?
let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night i left.  he is coming home to marry me.
are you all right?
fine.
have you seen willie?
is he not back yet?
claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. they say he never arrived.
it is far too late for him to still be out.
quite a place.
thank you, henry.
for what?
this. my home. my family.  if not for you, I would be dead in a burial pit somewhere.
yes. i took refuge in the barn. would not you? lost in the storm? freezing and wet? i was exhausted and could search no longer.
and is it true, miss moritz, that you love victor frankenstein? that your heart was broken?  answer the question. do you love victor frankenstein?
i have always loved him.
is it also not true that you murdered his brother william in a misdirected crime of passion?
murder willie? in my heart, he was our child. victor's and mine. such a thing could never have entered my mind.
so you have claimed. yet you have no explanation for this.  the locket last seen in the hands of the poor murdered child was found hidden in your dress the morning following the murder. the locket you so coveted.  how did it come to be in your possession?
i have no knowledge of that.
my mind was not playing tricks. he was there in the storm... gloating over his crimes... challenging me to come.
but why risk yourself? has not this family suffered enough?
I have no choice
if what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
they have done a fine job. hanging an innocent for the crime of a fiend.
do you know this man? is there something between you?
i know only that he is a killer. and i shall bring back his carcass.
come warm yourself if you like.
you speak.
yes, i speak. and read. and think... and know the ways of man.  I have been waiting for you. two months now.
how did you find me?
the letters in your journal. that and a geography book.  your elizabeth sounds lovely.
kill me and have done with it.
kill you? hardly that.
then why am i here? what did you want with me?
more to the point, why am i here? what did you want with me?  what does one say to one's maker, having finally met him face to face? milton gave it voice.  did i request thee, maker, from my clay to mould me man? did i solicit thee from darkness to promote me?
fine words from a child killer. you who murdered my brother.
your crime... as well as mine.
how dare you. you are disgusting and evil.
evil?  do you believe in evil?
i see it before me.
I am not sure i believe. but then i had no one to instruct me. i had no mother... and my father abandoned me at birth.
why, victor? why? what were you thinking?
there was something at work in my soul which i do not understand.
what of my soul? do i have one? or was that a part you left out?  who were these people of which i am comprised? good people? bad people?
materials. nothing more.
you are wrong. do you know i knew how to play this?
in which part of me did this knowledge reside? in these hands? in this mind? in this heart?  and reading and speaking. not things learned... so much as things remembered.
trace memories in the brain, perhaps.
stolen memories. stolen and hazy. they taunt me in my dreams. I have seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. whose woman was this? I have seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. whose childhood friends were these?  who am i?
i do not know.
then perhaps i believe in evil after all.
what can i do?
there is something i want.  a friend.
friend?
a companion. a female. like me, so she will not hate me.
like you? oh, god, you do not know what you are asking.
i do know that for the sympathy of one living being, i would make peace with all.  i have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. and rage the likes of which you would not believe. if i cannot satisfy the one, i will demonically indulge the other. that choice is yours.  you are the one who set this in motion, frankenstein.
and if i consent?
we would travel north, my bride and i. to the furthest reaches of the pole, where no man has ever set foot. there we would live out our lives. together.  no human eye would ever see us again. this i vow.
soon?
yes. i want this over and done with.
I will be waiting. and watching.
i thought I would never see you again!
I am all right. I am safe,
what happened up there?
i did not find what i was looking for.
what sort of task?
it is not something i can explain now. perhaps someday.
what of our marriage? victor, we have had so much tragedy. i want this family to live again.
so do i.
we need each other now, i need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
a month at most, that is all i ask.  elizabeth, please. things have not yet resolved. i must take steps to see that they do. for our family's sake. for our sake.  you are life itself. we shall seal our vow. the moment i am done.
why... her?
her body pleases me.
what is this?
a brain. extremities.
this was not taken from a grave.
what does it matter? she will live again. you will make her.
no. i draw the line.
you will honor your promise to me!
i will not! kill me now!
that is mild compared to what will come. if you deny me my wedding night. I will be with you on yours.
no. not tomorrow, not next week, marry me today.
why the change? what about your work?
it was misguided and pointless. is your answer yes?
it is
we will leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. pack only what you need.
does this have something to do with that man you saw?
yes. we are in danger here. every moment we stay.
victor, tell me why! trust me!
i do. but you must trust me for now.
are you sure you will be all right?
yes, do not worry. I will look after your father. you look after her.
I will be back as soon as I have got her far away and safe. we will hunt this fiend down together.
only if you will tell me who he is.
i owe you that. done.
brother and sister no more.
now husband and wife.
i remember the first time i ever saw you. crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. so beautiful even then.
i have been waiting for this ever since.
victor!
open this door for no-one!
she is beautiful.
she is not for you.
I am sure the lady knows her own mind. does not she? let her decide the proper suitor.
get away from her! she is mine!
she will never be yours! she said my name! she remembers!
all that i once loved lies in a shallow grave. by my hand.
let it go.
a warming wind.
this ice will break yet.  how is our guest?
he died. raving about phantoms. he was mad, poor devil.  gather a detail. have the body removed from my cabin.
aye, captain.
you were with him at the end.
yes.
i was watching.
i longed to be with him. but i wanted his final moments to have peace. i could see you were a friend to him.
what is that to you? evil as you are.
i am as he made me. in his own image.
you drove him to his torment.
and he drove me to mine.
then why weep for him?
would you not? he was father. and mother. we fell from grace together. he from his god. i from mine.
I have never been shown a kindness. show me one now.
what kindness?
build for him a pyre. light up the sky with his passing.
