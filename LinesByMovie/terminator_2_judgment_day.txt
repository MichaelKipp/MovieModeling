your foster parents are kinda dicks, right?
gimme that phillips right there.
easy money!
where did you learn all this stuff?
so she is pretty cool, huh?
actually, no, she is a complete psycho.  that is why she is up at pescedero.  she tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
no shit?
yeah, she is a total loser.  c'mon, let's check out the 7-eleven, whatya say?
i know.  this is a dream, sarah.
oh.  yeah.  they... make me take this stuff...
i love you.  i always will.
oh, god... kyle.  i need you so much.
they took him from me.
it is john who is the target now.  you have to protect him.  he is wide open.
i know!
do not quit, sarah.  our son need you.
i know, but I am not as strong as I am supposed to be.  i can not do it.  I am screwing up the mission.
remember the message... the future is not set. there is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
kyle, do not go!
there is not much time left in the world, sarah.
... it's... like a giant strobe light, burning right through my eyes... but somehow i can still see.  look, you know the dream's the same every night, why do i have to --
please continue...
it is not just a dream.  it is real, you moron! i know the date is happens!!
I am sure it feels very real to you --
on august 29th 1997 it is going to feel pretty fucking real to you, too!  anybody not wearing number two million sunblock in going to have a real bad day, get it?
relax now, sarah --
you think you are alive and safe, but you are already dead.  everybody, you, him...  everybody... you are all fucking dead!
it has helped me a lot to have a goal, something to look forward to.
and what it that?
you said i could be transferred to the minimum security wing and have visitors if i showed improvement in six months.  well, it is been six months, and i was looking forward to seeing my son.
i see.  let's go back to what you were saying about these terminator machines.  now you think they do not exist?
but you have told me on many occasions about how you crushed one in a hydraulic press.
if i had, there would have been some evidence. they would have found something at the factory.
i see.  so you do not believe anymore that the company covered it up?
so what do you think, doctor?  I have shown a lot of improvement, have not i?
you see, sarah... here's the problem.  i know how smart you are, and i think you are just telling me what i want to hear.  i do not think you really believe who you have been telling me today.
now do not take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?
yes.  cyberdyne systems, model 101.
no way!
holy shit... you are really real!  i mean... whoah!  you're, uh... like a machine underneath, right... but sort of alive outside?
I am a cybernetic organism.  living tissue over a metal endoskeleton.
this in intense.  get a grip, john.  okay, uh... you are not here to kill me... i figured that part out for myself.  so what is the deal?
my mission is to protect you.
yeah?  who sent you?
you did.  thirty years from now you reprogrammed me to be your protector here, in this time.
so this other guy?  he is a terminator too, right, like you?
not like me.  a t-1000.  advanced prototype. a mimetic polyalloy.
what does that mean?
liquid metal.
radical.
you are targeted for termination.  the t-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. ever.
where we going?
we have to leave the city, immediately.  and avoid the authorities.
can i stop by my house?
negative.  the t-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
you sure?
i would.
I am right here.  I am fine.  what is the dog's name?
max.
i need a minute here, okay?  you are telling me it can imitate anything it touches?
anything it samples by physical contact.
like it could disguise itself as anything... a pack of cigarettes?
no.  only an object of equal size.
well, why does not become a bomb or something to get me?
it can not form complex machines.  guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  it does not work that way.  but it can form solid metal shapes.
we spent a lot of time in nicaragua... places like that.  for a while she was with this crazy ex-green beret guy, running guns.  then there were some other guys.  she would shack up with anybody she could learn from.  so then she could teach me how to be this great military leader.  then she gets busted and it is like... sorry kid, your mom's a psycho.  did not you know?  it is like... everything I would been brought up to believe was just made-up fantasy, right? i hated her for that.  but everything she said was true.  we got to get her out of there.
negative.  the t-1000's highest probability for success now would be to copy sarah connor and wait for you to make contact with her.
oh, great.  and what happens to her?
typically, the subject being copied is terminated.
terminated!?  shit!  why did not you tell me? we got to right now!
negative.  she is not a mission priority.
yeah, well fuck you, she is a priority to me!
oww!  why did you do that?
you told me to.
you have to do what i say?!
that is one of my mission parameters.
prove it... stand on one foot.
jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
of course.  I am a terminator.
listen to me, very carefully, okay?  you are not a terminator any more.  alright?  you got that? you can not just go around killing people!
why?
whattaya mean, why?  'cause you can't!
why?
you just can't, okay?  trust me on this.
you broke my arm!
there is 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. that is one.  now do not move!
now remember, you are not going to kill anyone, right?
right.
swear.
what?
just say "i swear i will not kill anyone."
you are already dead, silberman.  everybody here dies.  you know i believe that.  so do not fuck with me!
open the goddamn door!
everything.
cool.
this t-1000... what happens when you shoot it?
ballistic penetration shocks it, but only for a few seconds.
can it be destroyed?
unknown.
you look like handmade shit.
so do you.
I will bet. makes you a more efficient killer, right?
correct.
does it hurt?
i sense injuries.  the data could be called pain.
how long do you live?  i mean, last?
a hundred and twenty years on my existing power cell.
my cpu is a neural-net processor... a learning computer.  but skynet presets the switch to "read-only" when we are sent out alone.
does not want you thinking too much, huh?
no.
out of the way, john!
no!  do not kill him!
it, john.  not him.  it.
alright, it!  we need it!
we are better off by ourselves.
but it is the only proof we have to the future... about the war and all that.
i do not trust it!  these things are hard to kill, john, believe me, i know.  we may never have this opportunity again.
look, mom, if I am supposed to ever be this great leader, you should start listening to my leadership ideas once in a while.  'cause if you won't, nobody else will.
affirmative.
no, no, no.  you got to listen to the way people talk.  see, you do not say like "affirmative" or some shit like that.  you say... no problemo.
it someone comes off to you with an attitude, you say "eat me"... if you wanna shine them on, it is "hasta la vista, baby".
"hasta la vista, baby"?
yeah, or "later, dickwad."  or if someone gets upset you say "chill out."  like that.  or you can do combinations.
chill out, dickwad.
that is great!  see, you are getting it.
no problemo.
and that is another thing.  you could lighten up a bit, yourself.  this severe routine is getting old.  smile once in a while.
smile?
yeah.  smile.  you know.  people smile, right? watch.
we are not going to make it, are we?  people, i mean.
it is in your nature to destroy yourselves.
yeah.  drag, huh?
i need to know how skynet get built.  who is responsible?
the man most directly responsible is miles bennet dyson, director of special projects at cyberdyne systems corporation.
why him?
in a few months he creates a revolutionary type of mircoprocessor.
then what?
in three years cyberdyne will become the largest supplier of military computer systems.  all stealth bombers are upgraded with cyberdyne computers, becoming fully unmanned,  afterward, the fly with a perfect operational record.
uh huh, great.  then those fat fucks in washington figure, what the hell, let a computer run the whole show, right?
basically.  the skynet funding bill is passed.  the system goes on-line august 4th, 1997.  human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  it becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, august 29. in a panic, they try to pull the plug.
and skynet fights back.
yes.  it launches its icbms against their targets in russia.
why attack russia?
because skynet knows the russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
jesus.  how much do you know about dyson?
i have detailed files.
i want to know everything.  what he looks like. where he lives.  everything.
you going to work all day?
I am sorry, baby.  this thing is just kicking my ass.  i thought we had it with this one...
... but the output went to shit after three seconds.  I am thinking now it is the way I am matrixing the command hierarchies...
you need a break.  you will see it clear when you come back.
i can not
miles, it is sunday.  you promised to take the kids to raging waters today.
oh.  i can't, honey.  I am on a roll here.
baby, this thing is going to blow 'em all away. it is a neural-net process --
i know.  you told me.  it is a neural-net processor.  it thinks and learns like we do. it is superconducting at room temperature. other computer are pocket calculators by comparison.  but why is that so goddamn important, miles? i really need to know, 'cause i feel like I am going crazy here, sometimes.
I am sorry, honey, it is just that I am thiiis close.
imagine a jetline with a pilot that never makes a mistake, never gets tired, never shows up to work with a hangover.  meet the pilot.
why did you marry me, miles?  why did we have these two children?  you do not need us.  your heart and your mind are in here.  but it does not love you like we do.
excellent.
yeah, i thought you would like this place.
not even of dying?
no.
you do not feel any emotion about it one way or the other?
no.  i have to stay functional until my mission is complete.  then it does not matter.
torque wrench please.
here.  i wish i coulda met my real dad.
you will.
yeah.  i guess so.  my mom says when i'm, like, 45, i think, i send him back through time to 1984.  but right now he has not even been born yet.  man, is messes with your head.  where is that other bolt?  thanks.  mom and him were only together for one night, but she still loves him, i guess.  i see her crying sometimes.  she denies it totally, of course.  like she says she got something in her eye.
why do you cry?
you mean people?  i do not know.  we just cry. you know.  when it hurts.
pain causes it?
uh-unh, no, it is different... it is when there is nothing wrong with you but you hurt anyway.  you get it?
no.
alriight!!  my man!
no problemo.
"no fate."  no fate but what we make.  my father told her this... i mean i made him memorize it, up in the future, as a message to her -- never mind.  okay, the whole thing goes "the future is not set.  there is no fate but what we make for ourselves."
she intends to change the future somehow.
i guess, yeah --  oh shit!!
dyson.
yeah, got to be!  miles dyson!  she is going to blow him away!
this is tactically dangerous.
drive faster.
the t-1000 has the same files that i do.  it could anticipate this move and reacquire you at dyson's house.
i do not care.  we have got to stop her.
killing dyson might actually prevent the war.
i do not care!! there is got to be another way. have not you learned anything?!  have not you figured out why you can not kill people?
please... let... the kids... go...
shut up!  shut up!!  motherfucker!  it is all your fault!  it is your fault!!
mom?  you okay?
i couldn't... oh, god.  you... came here... to stop me?
uh huh.
it is okay.  it will by okay.  we will figure it out.
i love you, john.  i always have.
i know, mom.  i know.
do you have bandages?
in the bathroom.  danny, can you get them for us?
my god.
now listen to me very carefully.
yeah.  right.  how were you supposed to know? fucking men... all you know how to do is thrust into the world with your... fucking ideas and your weapons.  did you know that every gun in the world is named after a man?  colt, browning, smith, thompson, kalashnikov... all men.  men built the hydrogen bomb, not women... men like you thought it up.  you are so creative.  you do not know what it is like to really create something... to create a life.  to feel it growing inside you.  all you know how to create is death... you fucking bastards.
mom, mom, we need to be more constructive here. i do not see this as a gender-related issue.  she is still tense.  we still have to figure out how to stop it all from happening.  right?
but i thought... are not we changing things?  i mean... right now?  changing the way it goes?
that is right!  there is no way I am going to finish the new processor now.  forget it.  I am out of it.  I am quitting cyberdyne tomorrow... I will sell real estate, i do not care,,,
look, whatever you want me to do, I will do.  i just want my kids to have a chance to grow up, okay?
no one must follow your work.
alright, yeah.  you are right.  we have to destroy the stuff at the lab, the files, disk drive... and everything i have here.  everything! i do not care.
do you know about the chip?
what chip?
they have it in a vault at cyberdyne...  it is got to be from the other one like you.
the cpu from the first terminator.
son of a bitch, i knew it!
they told us not to ask where they got it.  i thought... japan... hell, i do not know.  i did not want to know.
those lying motherfuckers!
i was scary stuff, radically advanced.  it was shattered... did not work.  but it gave us ideas, it took us in new directions... things we would never have thought of.  all this work is based on it.
i must be destroyed.
can you get us in there, past security?
is it safe for them here?
take your kids.  go to a hotel.  right now. do not pack.  let's go.
we should abort.
no!! we are going all the way!  you got that, dyson?
no good.
let me try mine.
i got it.  piece of cake.
go!  I will finish here.
I will deal with the police.
remember what i said, you can't...
trust me.
ready to rock?
ready.
drive for a minute.
where you going?!
we do not have much time.
what?
john, get out of the way!!
shoot!!!!
is it dead?
terminated.
will it melt in there?
yes.  throw it in.
it is finally over.
no.  there is another chip.
no!
I am sorry, john.
no, no no!!  it will be okay.  stay with us!
i have to go away, john.
do not do it.  please... do not go --
it must end here... or i am the future.
i order you not to!
are you afraid?
yes.
