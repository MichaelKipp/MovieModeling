who was this fuckin' guy?
rock and roll, gus.  johnny boz.
i never heard of him.
before your time, pop.  mid-sixties.  five or six hits. he's got a club down in the fillmore now.
not now he don't.
maybe the maid did it.
she's 54 years old and weighs 240 pounds.
he left the club with his girlfriend about midnight.  that's the last time anybody saw him.
what was it?
talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. what are they nervous about?
they're executives.  they're nervous about everything.
keep your three o'clock.
do you want me to work the case, phil, or do you want me to --
i said keep it.
ain't that cute?  they got his and her pig-assos, son.
i didn't know you knew who picasso was, gus.
i'm a smart sonofabitch.  i just hide it.
we're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
are you vice?
homicide.
what do you want?
when was the last time you saw john boz?
is he dead?
why do you think he's dead?
you wouldn't be here otherwise, would you?
were you with him last night?
you're looking for catherine, not me.
who are you?
i'm roxy.  i'm her -- friend.
i'm de...
i know who you are.
how did he die?
he was murdered.
really.  maybe that's why you're from homicide.  how?
how long were you dating him?
i wasn't dating him.  i was fucking him.
how long were you having sex with him?
about a year and a half.
were you with him last night?
yes.
did you leave the club with him?
yes.
did you go home with him?
no.  we had a drink at the club. we left together.  i came here. he went home.
was there anyone with you last night?
no.  i wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
i don't really feel like talking anymore.
listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
read me my rights and arrest me and i'll go downtown.
how are you, nick?
i'm fine.  come on, beth!  you know i'm fine!  how the hell long do i have to keep doing this?
as long as internal affairs wants you to, i suppose.  sit down, nick.
it's bullshit.  you know it is.
i know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay?
so -- how are things?
things are fine.  i told you. they're fine.
how is your -- personal life?
my sex life is fine.  my sex life is pretty shitty actually since i stopped seeing you -- maybe i should think about my electrolux again.
how about the booze?
it's been three months.
how about the coke?
no.
no?
no!  i'm working my tail off.  i'm off the sauce, i'm not even smoking anymore.
how's not smoking?
it's fucked -- now will you please tell i.a. that i'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
yes.
thank you.
how'd it go, son?
she misses me.
hallelujah.
she's a suspect.
on what basis?
catherine tramell.  age 30.  no priors, no convictions.  double major, magnum cum laude, berkeley, 1980.  literature and psychology. daughter, sole survivor -- marvin and elaine tramell, killed in a boating accident, 1978, catherine tramell sole heir.  estimated assets $110 million.
are you kidding me?
formerly engaged to roberto vasquez, deceased --
i love it.  she's got a hundred million bucks.  she fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  and she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
you forgot her degree in literature. she's a writer.  she published a novel last year under a pen name. do you want to know what it's about?
so what do we do -- nothing?
we bring her in for questioning.
she's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
she was the last person seen with the guy -- i'll take the responsibility.
it's yours.
ms. tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
are you arresting me?
if that's the way you want to play it.
do you always keep old newspapers around?
only when they make interesting reading.
you have the right to an attorney.
why would i need an attorney?
do you have a cigarette?
i don't smoke.
yes, you do.
i quit.
i thought you were out of cigarettes.
i found some in my purse; would you like one?
i told you -- i quit.
it won't last.
you workin' on another book?
yes i am.
it must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time.
it teaches you to lie.
how's that?
you make it up, but it has to be believable.  they call it suspension of disbelief.
i like that.  "suspension of disbelief."
what's your new book about?
a detective.  he falls for the wrong woman.
i'm john corrigan.  i'm an assistant district attorney, ms.  tramell. can we get you anything?  would you like some coffee?
no thank you.
did i miss something?
i told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
i told them you wouldn't want to hide.
i have nothing to hide.
there is no smoking in this building, ms. tramell.
what are you going to do?  charge me with smoking?
would you tell us the nature of your relationship with mr. boz?
i had sex with him for about a year and a half.  i liked having sex with him.
did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
exactly what do you have in mind, mr. corrigan.
did you ever tie him up?
no.
but you said you liked men to use their hands.
no.  i said i liked johnny to use his hands.  i don't give any rules, nick.  i go with the flow.
did you kill mr. boz, ms. tramell?
i'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way i described in my book. i'd be announcing myself as the killer.  i'm not stupid.
we know you're not stupid, ms. tramell.
maybe that's what you're counting on to get you off the hook.
writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.
yes it does, doesn't it?
the answer is no.  i didn't kill him.
do you use drugs, ms. tramell?
sometimes.
what kind of drugs?
cocaine.
you like playing games, don't you?
i've got a degree in psych.  it goes with the turf.  games are fun.
how did you feel when he died?
i loved him.  i hurt.
how did you feel when i told you johnny boz had died -- that day at the beach.
i felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
but you didn't hurt --
no.
because you didn't love him --
that's right.
even though you were fucking him.
you still get the pleasure.  didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, nick?
in the beginning.  then i got to like what he did for me.
that's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
i'm a writer,  i use people for what i write.  you write what you know.  let the world beware.
sure.
thanks.
i'm tired.
it's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
if i were guilty, and if i wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  it wouldn't be tiring at all.
why not?
because i'm a professional liar. i spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies.  for my writing.
i passed.
you see?  we're both innocent, nick.
how do you know all this stuff about me?
you know all about me.
i don't know anything that isn't police business.
you know i don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, nick?
what is all this "nick" stuff -- nick would you like a cigarette. nick can you give me a ride.
she didn't ask me for the ride. she asked anybody.
and you volunteered.
what you doin', son?
it's my first drink in three months. that okay with you, pop?  she doesn't know me.  i never saw her before gus and i talked to her.
you sure?
i'm sure.
now what?
what now what? now nothing.  she passed the polygraph.  that's it.
she knew she could beat it.  that's why she asked to take it.
how the fuck do you know?  what is it with you and this broad anyway?
come on, phil.  you're not gonna let this slide.  what about her parents?  what about what else she's published?  at least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
her parents died in an accident. i don't care what else she's written.  what are you -- a book critic?
how did they die?  was there an investigation?
how you're saying she killed her parents?  did she kill bobby vasquez, too?
not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
maybe she did, gus.  maybe she grew herself an afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
fuck you, phil.
fuck you, too nick.
you okay?
yeah.
you don't look so okay.
what are you doing here?
baby-sitting.  rookie cop.
what else is new?
maybe it's for old-time's sake.
sometimes i think he started banging her just to get himself off the hook with internal affairs.
he ain't that way.  he's got heart.
yeah.  i know.
what was she like?
who?
catherine tramell.
she said what you said she'd say.
we were in some of the same classes.
why didn't you tell me?
i need a cigarette.
i thought you quit.
you look like dogshit.
he looks a little shrunk, that's all.
we got a call from berkeley p.d. there was a killing.  a professor. icepick.  in his bed.  multiple stab wounds.  1977.
she was there, wasn't she?
gus -- go over to berkeley. harrigan -- find out what else she's published.  andrews -- get the files on her parents' accident. carbon beth on everything.  i want some psychological input on this andrews and harrigan go; nick is left there with gus.
what about me?
you're already gettin' psychological input, son.
go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  see where she leads.
ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
what are you doing here, pop?
i came in here to jack off the damn machine.  one dead psychology professor. noah goldstein.  dr. noah goldstein. and guess what?  he was her counselor.
was she ever suspect?
no, sir.  they never even got a statement from her.
do you remember a case -- 1956 -- hazel dobkins?
hell yes!  couldn't get it outta my head for years.  still can't. nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems.  one day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em.  all of 'em.  used a knife. he got for a wedding present. didn't even deny it.  sweet as honey.  said she didn't know why she done it.
am i... disturbing you?
no.  come in.
would you like a drink?  i was just going to have one.
no, thanks.
i'd like to ask you a few more questions.
i'd like to ask you some, too.
you tell me.
i don't know.  but you do.
it was an accident.  they got in the line of fire.
four shootings in five years.  all accidents.
they were drug buys.  i was a vice cop.
tell me about professor goldstein.
there's a name from the past.
you want a name from the present? how about hazel dobkins?
noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  that's probably where i got the idea for the icepick.  for my book. funny how the subconscious works.  hazel is my friend.
she wiped out her whole family.
yes.  she's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
didn't you study it in school?
only in theory.  you know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter?  not in theory -- in practice.
what happened, nick?  did you get sucked into it? did you like it too much?
no.
i didn't.
yes, you did.  they never tested you, did they?  but internal affairs knew.
what are you talking about, nick -- what's wrong with you?
who's got access to my goddamn file?
it's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --she backs into a wall.  she looks very scared. he comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.
don't, beth.  don't lie to me.
it's internal affairs, isn't it?
no, nick, please --
who?
nilsen.
what's goin' down, son?
nothin'  i'll be okay, pop.
no, sir.  you won't.  there's smoke off yonder on the horizon.  they're gonna want your badge.
i got tired of being played with.
you sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that.
she knows where i live and breathe. she's coming after me.
what is it you got between you?
i don't know.
somethin', though.
i don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything.  we went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times?  it wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
sometimes i really hate you.
yeah?  well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out.  but take my advice.  put a little more life into it than you usually do.
you did it for me.
yes.  i care about you.  i did it for you.
you think i --
i don't son, but i got the minority opinion.
okay.  i went after him.  i lost my temper.
do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
no.
where were you tonight?
home. watching tv.
all night?
yeah.
were you drinking?
yeah, i was drinking.
when did you start drinking again?
a couple days ago.
there's no smoking in this building.
what are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
i'll ask you once, nick -- for the record did you kill him?
no.
come on -- i'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night i'm going to kill him?  i'd have to be really dumb to do that.
going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi.
i don't think it's funny.
well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, i'll say that.
it's the least i could do... considering i got you into this mess with those reports.
no.  i mean it, thank you.
how do you know catherine tramell saw my reports?
she knows stuff about me that only you know.
she must really be something.  from a clinical point of view.
what was she like in school?
i hardly knew her.  she gave me the creeps, though.  i don't know why.
beth.  i didn't mean what i said. about --
yes you did.  i'm a big girl.  i can handle it.
take care, you hear?
did you find out about her parents?
you're on leave, man.  you're on psycho leave.  i'm talking to a possible whacko here.
you know i'm whacko, sam, what'd you find?
the boat blew.  there was a leak in the gas line.  there were two previous repairs.  there was a five-mil policy on both of 'em.  a real heavy investigation.  zilch. goose-egg.  it was an accident.
thanks.
i.a.'s going to talk to you more about nilsen.  they're handling the investigation, we're not. stay in touch with dr. gardner, it'll help on the evaluation.
she killed him.
beth?  now you've got beth killing people?
catherine tramell.  it's part of her game.
first you've got her buying your file.  now you've got her killing nilsen.  forget her, willya?  go someplace.  sit in the sun.  get away from this goddamn fog.  get her out of your system.
you don't but it, do you?  she knew nobody would but it.  she knew i'd say she did it.  and she knew nobody would buy it.
how exactly did you hear?
i have attorneys.  they have friends.  i have friends.  money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
i don't know about that i don't have any money i don't have any attorneys gus is my only real friend.
i wasn't talking about real friends. why doesn't gus like me.
i like you.
do you?
yeah.  would you like to come up and have a drink?
you're not easy to figure.  i'm just very good at figuring.
don't get too cocky.
why not?
you can make a mistake.
not me.
jack daniel's okay?  it's gonna have to be.
fine.
ice?
please.
what did you pay nilsen?
isn't he the policeman that you shot, shooter?
what if i asked you not to call me shooter?
what if i call you nicky?
my wife used to call me that.
i know, nicky, but i like it.
cheers.  my friends call me catherine.
what did bobby vasquez used to call you?
bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  you don't have any coke, do you?  i love coke and jack daniel's.
there's pepsi in the fridge.
it's not the same thing, is it?
say -- "what do you want from me, catherine?"
what do you want from me, catherine?
aren't you going to thank me?
what's it about?
a boy kills his parents.  they have a plane.  he makes it look like an accident.
why does he do it?
to see if he can get away with it.
when did you write it?
you mean did i write it before my parents died?
yes.
no.  i wrote it years afterwards.
you're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
no.
good.  i'd miss you.  you can get into trouble, though. you're not really a cop anymore.
i'll risk it.
why take the risk?
to see if i can get away with it.
how's your new book?
i'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
i'm leaving the house around midnight.  in case you're going to follow me.  i'm going down to johnny's club.
i'll meet you there.
forgive me for askin', son, and i don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
she want to play?  fine.  i can play.
everybody that she plays with dies.
i know what that's like.
maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
she's seen everything before.
did you think it was so special?
i told her it was the fuck of the century.
what did you think?
i thought it was a pretty good beginning.
how about roxy?  is she a fuck to the century, too?
do you want her to join us sometime?
how's your shoulder?
fine.  how's your back?
it hurts.
are you kidding?  you think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  i don't do those.
i thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
i told you i had a vivid imagination.
you shouldn't play this game.
i don't have a choice.
you're in over your head.
i know.
easy there, partner -- i wasn't there.
i went over last night, too.
i wasn't there last night, either.
you... fucked her!  goddamn dumb sonofabitch... you fucked her! goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
i'm not gonna get aids, pop --don't worry about it.  i always use a rubber.
i don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about aids!
you oughta use a rubber, pop.  you really should.
what in the hell for?  you think i'm gettin' any at my age?  i don't like blue-haired women.  i don't like 'em.
you don't like punk rockers?
say what?
you feeling better?
i feel fine!
i'm not afraid of her.
why the hell not?
i don't know.  i'm just not.
that's her pussy talkin' --he gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger.  he winks at her.  the woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
it doesn't make sense.  she didn't know me three months ago.
maybe it wasn't her that paid him. maybe the money was for somethin' else.  how the fuck do i know? i'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
you all right, pop?  you want me to drive you?
in that little pissant car of yours? hell, no.  i ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- i'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate seiko watch.
come on, i'll drive you in this thing.
you think i'd let you drive my cadillac car?  i ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my cadillac car.
tell me again.  i want to hear you say it again.
it was an accident.
you're driving around north beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
i don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
don't fuck with me, nick.  i don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling.
you knew her, didn't you?
gus and i talked to her at tramell's house.  all we did was write her name down.
i told you to stay away from tramell.
yeah.  but you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
i want you in dr. gardner's office at nine o'clock.  you're out of control, curran.
who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
what is your problem?  i'm trying to help you.  why won't you let me help you?
i don't need any help.
yes you do.  something's on with you.  you're sleeping with her, aren't you?
what is this interest you've got in her?
my interest is in you, not in her. she seduces people, she manipulates --
i thought you hardly know her.
i know the type.  i'm a psychologist.
i should have known.  i came into the house when you were down on the beach.  she looked at me so strangely.  she left right after you.  i shouldn't have let her watch us. she wanted to watch me all the time.  she tried to kill you, didn't she?
did you like her to watch?
do you think i told her to kill you?
no.
everybody that i care about dies.
it's ok.  it's ok.
make love to me.
do you think she killed johnny boz?
for what... to set me up?  she loved me she wouldn't frame me.
maybe she got jealous of johnny boz, too.
no, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  i don't have luck with women. there was this girl i met while i was in college.  i slept with her once.  she started following me around, taking my picture.  she dyed her hair, copied my clothes. lisa something... oberman.  it was awful.
i thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
i never have before.
no.
no?
no more games, nick.  i'm tired of playing games!
you won't believe me.
try me.
i paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
when?
about three months before i met you.
why?
i'd read about your shootings in the papers.  i decided to write a book about a detective.  i wanted to know my character.
you paid $50,000 for your character?
i would've paid more.  i wanted to know everything about you.  then you came down here after johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
what about the other night. what about last night?  was that to get to know your character?
maybe i'm losing interest in my book.
do you believe me?
i don't know.
i'll convince you.
catherine says you don't like her.
she's right.  you got an icepick in you yet?
what did he say?
he asked if i had an icepick in me yet.
funny.
you know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?
i don't believe it.
why not?
you're my friend, gus.
how old was she when this happened?
fourteen.  we seal juvenile records until they're deceased.  that's why you didn't find it in your computer.
what was the motive?
she said she didn't know herself, just sort of did it on impulse.  the razor just happened to be there.
i don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop.
ain't that hard, son.  this young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em.  just like 'ole hazel dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present.  she used daddy's razor.
i'm not sure anymore she did it.
which one you talkin' about now, son?  we know ole hazel did it; we know young roxy did it -- and the other one well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
anderson.  jack w. donald m.  i'm sorry.  no lisa.
did you check all four years?
yes i did.
can you check again?
no lisa anderson, detective.
can there be some mistake?
only if you're making it.
can i talk to you a minute?
honey, why don't you go in the car?  i'll be right there.
you like to hang out with murderers or what?  did you know roxy --
of course i knew.
i can get my butt kicked for this. you're not supposed to be in here.
it's not gonna take long, sam.
hey, that's dr. gardner, isn't it?
bring 1976 up.
what do you want, nick?
tell me about catherine.
she told you, didn't she?
what did she tell me, beth?
i slept with her once in school.  i was just a kid.  i was experimenting.  it was just that one time.  she developed a... fixation... on me.  she styled her hair like mine. she wore the same kind of clothes i did.  it scared me.
i did dye my hair.  it didn't have anything to do with her.  i was a redhead for a while, too.
did you know noah goldstein?
i had him in two classes.
you saw all the reports, beth!
she's really sick you know.  don't you know what she's doing?  she knows i went to berkeley.  she knows i knew noah.  she makes up that story about me.  she's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
she didn't hand you to me.  she doesn't even know who you are. she told me about lisa henderson.
she knew you'd find out who lisa henderson is.  you're a good cop -- what did she do?  tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant?  did she tell you in bed, nick? that's how i'd do it.
why did you change your name?
i got married.  he was on staff at the clinic.  i was down in salinas.  it didn't... last long.
you should do something about this lock.
she's evil.  she's brilliant.  be careful, nick.
i just thought i'd surprise you.  what's the matter?
i found lisa henderson.
did you?  what's she doing?
you're not going to tell me what she's doing.  i thought we weren't playing games anymore.
i did, too.  she told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
you still think i kill people, don't you?
no.
liar.
so nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  you don't know what the hell was in it?
catherine told me what was in it.
if she's telling  you the truth.
don't you get it, gus?  if beth killed johnny boz to frame catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at berkeley.  it gives her the motive to kill nilsen.
how did she know nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
he was i.a.  he probably asked her about it.
she'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound christmas fruitcake. she's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is.
she's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes.  there's gotta be somebody at berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
i know what happened.  catherine told me what happened.
you got goddamn tweety-birds flutterin' around your head, that's what you got.  you think you're gonna fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after?  oh, man.
how'd you get in here?
i decided to give you one more chance.  i missed you.
you didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
did you miss me?
no.
come over here and tell me no.
i have to do some research tomorrow.
i'm very good at research.  i'll help you.
no thanks.
what are you researching?
i'm writing a book.
really.  what are you writing about.
a detective.  he falls for the wrong girl.
what happens to them?
they fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
it won't sell.
why not?
