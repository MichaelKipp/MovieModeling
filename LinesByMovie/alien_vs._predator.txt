that is the second time i ran it, and it still reads the same.
better tell the boss.
where did you leave them?
camped out by the navi-beacon out on linson's range.  they are making their own way back tomorrow.
marsco went belly-up on the dow jones.
shit.  when?
yesterday.  we got the network feed from gateway; it was the top story on 'sixty seconds'.  biggest market crash since twenty-four.
fucking great.  i invested some money in them.
you win some, you loose some.
i lose 'em all, that is why I am still out here on this rock.  anything else you wanna ruin my day with?
no, but i got something that might interest you.
a pair of incomings.  they popped-up on the medium-range about thirteen twenty-four local time.
we figured on it being a magnetic anomaly, but we ran a back-trace just to make sure.
yeah.  turns out they dropped straight out of hyperspace.
curious thing is, the mass detector says they are too small to carry a deep-space drive.
sounds like a couple of escape shuttles.
that is what we thought.
have you got an updated lloyds' almanac to cross-reff them through?
done it already.  nothing matches.
jesus.
yeah, exactly.  those are pre-programmed course adjustments you are looking at.
tactical nukes, maybe?
where are they headed?
we ran a trajectory simulation.  if they carry on along that path, it is possible they will make intra-orbital insertion.
fort powell.  what do we tell 'em?
just give them the facts.  they can leap to their own conclusions.
nice howitzer you have got there.
thanks.
good argument for gun-control.  what are you going after, rhino?
nah.  i just wanna squeeze off a few rounds.  'sides, they tagged the rhinos for the migration project, so they are protected.  they will dock you a month's pay for just mentioning it.
see that sheathing on the suspension? eaten away.  same thing with the pumps on the base air purifiers.  the algae out here just is not good on these new plastics.
we have not used big bertha since we relocated the generator module. that was four months ago.  i can not ask for them to keep bringing spares in on the shuttle, it is already costing too much as it is.
miss noguchi!  you are wanted in admin.
thanks.
when?
seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
can we move it to a different orbit in time?
already working on it.
get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
can you patch me a temporary loop on dcmgs?
okay, give me the numbers.
they have changed their heading again.
compensate!
punch me in a solution for their delta-vee.
what do you need?
a three-second burn to port, on my mark.
it is on the board.
picking up velocity.
match it!
me either.  i tell you, i used to be with a mining outfit on callisto, and when something like that hits... believe me, you know about it.
do you wanna head back and call it in?
hey, boss.  wondered where you would gotten to.
i just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  clear my head.
did not feel like whoopin' it up with the rest of us blue collars, huh?
I have got a lot of thinking to do.  'sides, the room was getting too crowded for me.
not too much of the socializing type, then?
no, not really.  more sort of the  'claustrophobic' type.
I am serious.  that is why i switched from orbiting to planetary installations.
is that a fact.
uh-huh.  used to get it pretty bad.  I would wake up in a cold sweat and want to claw open a vacuum hatch.
how long you been out here for now, anyway?  three months?
four.
and before that?
six month stint on datus.
only six?
what is this?  'twenty questions'?
just curious.  there is a lot of talk goes around.
what is that?
real man' drink.
seltzer?
want some?
any luck raising ackland's party?
nothing.  with the satellite down, we can not transmit over the mountain range. he is most likely sitting there wondering why he can not raise us.
first light, we will take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
'we'?  you wanna fly out there with me?
sure.  do me good to stretch my legs.
do not worry about it.  if the network goes by the book, like everyone figures they will, a marine gunboat from powell'll drop-by for a look- see in four-or-five days.  they can go poke around out there and find whatever it was hit us.  all we have got to do is sit tight.
do you think ackland'll sit tight?
there would have to be a helluva good reason for him not to.
nada. no radiation... no movement... nothing.
well, just keep looking.  it is got to be... whoa, jesus!
it is a rhino.
is it dead?
no, it is still breathing.  kinda clammy though.  are you sure your stick's not broken.
yeah, it is fine.
god, i hope that thing did not bring down a virus.
i told you we... what is that?
looks like a spore.  fungus of some kind, maybe?
bloody big if it is.  top's open.
let's get back and call this in.
wait a minute.
we have got no option.  we are going to have to get it off.
oh man...
minh...
yep...
yeah.  somebody won.
check out the tent.
I have found ackland!
hold on...
hey, jan.  see if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
what is the problem?
she was running a little sluggish on the way back.  think the turbines might be playing up.
give me twenty minutes and I will do it myself.
appreciate that.
I am going to need you to co-sign the report.  until we come up with something, this'll be treated as first degree murder.
agreed.
when we get the link back, and i send this in, i.c.c.'ll throw a fit.
ah, do not worry about i.c.c.  they are the least of your problems right now.
what do you mean?
think i spoke too soon...
again?  how long before we start noticing the difference?
headache?  dehydration?
the head's okay, but i could sink a six-pack.
forget that.  i want you off alcohol for at least seventy-two hours. I have got some toxin build-up tests still to run.
can i... um... have some water?  please?
sure.
do you believe him?
ackland?  i do not know him well enough to say.  if we were back on earth we could run him though an aldhoven test and find out for sure. there is not much we can do out here.
and...?
and, nothing.  they checked out just fine.
what is it?
it is nothing, doc.  just a... touch of indigestion... something.
do you want a tablet?
better?
yeah...
what happened?
york just turned up outside.  we are trying to get him into infirmary.
what is going on?
the door's sealed from inside.  doc revna's in there, and it sounds like ackland's going nuts.
force the door.
it left a melted trail on the deck all the way down to here...
what is that?
secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  i found the grating ripped right off.  the little fucker was strong.
where does that lead to?
central pumping.  all the waste gets  treated, broken-down, and flushed out into the swamp.  if it wanted a quick exit then it really lucked- out.
you have checked that end?
cornering it should not be a problem.  each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  if we disconnect them and seal off every section, we have got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  that should give us ample time to find it.
alright.  pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I will sign a release for the weapons.  cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.
nobody wander off on their own until it is found.  keep in pairs. diller, once the first team's done their sweep i want you to go down with annie to three-pump while she replaces it.
okay.
one final point.  killing this sonuvabitch ought to be a reward in itself.  however, just to add a little incentive... I am authorizing a hefty bonus in the next pay-packet for whoever does.
so, what do you think?
what do i think?  i think if those marines from powell do not shift their butts getting here, we are going to get caught up to our necks in the middle of something we shouldn't.
c'mon, man.  one more sweep.
one more sweep... one more sweep.  I am getting tired of one more fuckin' sweep. we are been lookin' for this thing for three days now, and found zip.
ah, quit griping.  keeps you in shape does not it?
hey!  i was in shape before we started doing this.
listen to what?
that is what i mean.  this is the quietest I have ever heard it.  it is unnatural.
de vries?
yeah?
next time you have a thought like that? keep it to yourself.
something spooking the rhinos?
i dunno.
hey, guttierez?
what?
take a look at this.
one of 'em must have escaped.
that is impossible, man.  this fence is high-tensile.  the breaking tolerance'd stand up to the strain of a rhino, easy. i know, i put it up.
there is no way a rhino'd survive that drop.
goldsmith's going to be plenty pissed at losing one of her babies.
that is a fact.
whoa, wait a minute...
what?
just got a reading...
how is it going?
yeah, 'good evening' to you, too.
today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
you should hit the sack, too.
nah, I will stick it out for another hour or so.
what time's sundown?
'bout five minutes.
give me a yell is something happens.
you got it, cowboy.
what?  are you nuts?  just the two of us?
I have seen this mother, de vries.  we can bag it, no problem.
forget it, man.
c'mon de vries.  think of the bonus.
fuck the bonus.  i hate heights.  you would not get me up there even if it was not night.
what the hell are you doing?
hey, fair enough.  if you will not come, I will handle it myself.
alright, okay.  look...
what?
I will come with you.
but I am going first...
anything you say, mammacitta.
careful of that edging there...
yeah, i got it.
still got him?
it is moving slow.  about... eleven metres. on the left.
hold it, hold it...
what is wrong?
I am picking up another signal.
what?  where?
just behind us, over to the right.
can not see a thing.  are you sure?
yeah, i...
wait.  lost it.
how?
i dunno.  might be a glitch.
oh, man.  that is no glitch!
it is alright, it is cool...
is it still moving?
no, he is stopped; he is totally still. just take it nice and easy, babe. nice and easy...
what?
I am out of ammo.  get inside, get inside!
seal everything now!
what is happening?
cassie, thank christ!  we are under attack.
we are what!?
how many of them are there?
too many.
that is the wrong way!
detour.  other way's blocked...
hurry it up.
do not wait for me!
it is too late!
nooooo!
everything on this module is locked and sealed.  we have lost 'b', 'c', and 'e' wings, but 'e' was the only one we did not manage to totally evacuate.
how many... how many people are missing?
unconfirmed reports of eighteen or so far, but the numbers are all over the place.
what is our weapons situation?
shit!  our armory's a big blue box from the back shelf of stores.  we got about two clips left for an autoloader, and that is it.
auto-shop?
auto-shop's sealed, but those boys are cut-off.
has anybody talked to them?
not yet.
do it.
they knocked out the external feeds.
looks like it.
give or take.
we are not going to make it, are we?
communications to auto-shop go through an f.o. link off the main trunk. that is down with the other feeds.
well... try the headset.
oh, man...
alright, let's keep calm.  we have got to have an option of some sort... there is got to be a way out of this.
that sounds promising.  can we operate the crane from here?
nah.  it is got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running.
which mean physically going outside.
is this the suit?
uh-huh.
how much air-time have i got?
about thirty minutes.  those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery.
deal.
we have dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. it will project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go.
yeah, i stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  that is also on the display.
sounds great.
it is not all good news.  we had to take off the helmet lights.  you will be going in blind.
what?  why?
we had to.  they were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you are going to have to negotiate.  besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where i doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick.
how tight are these shafts?
there is still time to back-out.
forget it.  i would not ask somebody to do something i would not do myself.  where is the disk?
thanks.
let's just run through it one more time so i know you have got it straight.
okay, i pull the access panel off of the console.  insert the disk, and press the green enabling button...
sorry.  two green enabling buttons...
right.  when you have done that, do not waste any time getting out of there.  once that crane starts moving...well, it is bound to provoke some kind of response.
are you alright?
what?  what is wrong?  what is it?
where is she?
comin' up the central reservoir.
quick!  run a trace on the culvert leading off the auto-shop maintenance pit.
i found it...
and?
drains right into the central reservoir.
get her on-line.  now!
i can not reach her.  too much signal break-up.
keep trying!
okay, we are in business.
right.  auto-shop, you all set?
okay, I am out of here!
blow those suckers, driscoll!
if i can get to the chopper, I will meet you at the rendezvous.  do not wait for me.
but...
move it baby, or they are going to be chewin' on my cojones!
couple more seconds!
they...they snapped my legs to fit... fit me in here.  i don't...remember what happened next.
what can i do?
i can... feel it moving around inside me. you have got to kill me.
i... i can't!
you have to...
no!
