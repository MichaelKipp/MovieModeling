rex. get away from the door.
look, marylin, can not we have a civilized discussion about this?
we are. and it is winding down.
but marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. everything i have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. the business is my entire life.
are you forgetting about the atcheson, topeka and the santa fe?
marylin?
rex. go away. i do not want to have to sic the dogs on you.
dogs?
mr. rexroth.
rex, please.
miles massey. please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
thank you.
now rex.
...well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
that is her job. you have to respect that.
when i first met marylin -- well, we were crazy about each other. not emotionally, of course. we just could not keep our hands off each other.
mm.
but then... but then...
time marches on. ardor cools.
no. not exactly. it did not exactly cool. marylin is a knock-out. and very sexy -- but -- there is a lot of it out there.
ah.
you know what i mean when i say "it."
gotcha. no need to get anatomically correct with me, rex.
seems like there is more of it than ever before --
well, with the expanding global population -- let me ask you this -- your wife. has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
i do not know. i can assume...
not in court you can't. has she retained counsel?
I am not sure.
and your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
video.
mmm... and to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
the fault, dear brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? what are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
that is the problem. i can not afford to give her anything.
nothing?
i know that sounds rough but I am about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I am mortgaged up to my ass. if this deal goes south, I am ruined -- I will lose millions.
so, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
well -- is that possible?
you want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
i did not know barry had a beach house.
neither did i until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name.
so who would you hire?
ruth rabino.
she is a legend. did not she do kravis or a pearlman? she definitely did a factor.
she did a harriman.
wow.
in the words of my private investigator, we are going to nail his ass.
I have been trying to nail george's for years, but he is very careful. I will just keep having children. i think I am pregnant, by the way.
ramona! do not get mia farrow on us.
three is not farrow.
who is rex's guy?
miles massey.
of massey myerson?
do you know him?
by reputation. he got ann rumsey that cute little island of george's.
george was so impressed he hired him when he divorced his second.
muriel rumsey.
who is she?
now? she is a night manager at mcdonalds.
you should have tried to get pregnant marylin -- solidify your position.
no.
you like kids.
i can not have a baby with a man i do not love... and i can not submit a child to divorce.
it is not so bad these days. kids like joint custody. two sets of toys.
maybe next time.
maybe.
we do have a man for you.
thorstenson gieselensen. he just separated from his third. he is in fish. he is fish.
she is keeping his name. and one of his planes. and all seven of his children
and only two are hers.
please. I am not seeing anyone until this is over. one husband at a time.
i wish i had your discipline.
mrs. guttman, you have testified that you were your husband's sexual slave for thirty-six years, ever since you were married --
except for two years when he was in the navy, in korea.
prior to your marriage, what was your profession?
i was a hostess. for trans-world airlines.
what is your husband's profession?
he manufactures staples and industrial brad-tacks. he is very successful.
wait... he wants to give her...?
nothing.
and she has...?
video.
what the fuck...?
wrigley!
sorry.
sometimes i have serious doubts about you.
i am very sorry.
am i mentoring the wrong mentee?
no. you are not.
i could be mentoring kramer. kramer clerked for scalia.
-- is not a challenge. i need something i can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
he would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in palm springs. he had a device he called the intruder.
-- ruth rabinow, this is rex rexroth. and you must be mrs. rexroth.
and you must be mr. massey.
hello, rex.
marylin.
are you alright? you lost weight.
my whole metabolism is -- off.
so, ruth. how is sam?
sam is sam. he is taking up fly fishing. he is in a yert in montana.
a yert.  ruth is a living legend, rex. at a time when most women are in boca, having early bird specials -- she is working so her husband can be in montana. in a yert.
what?!
oh, just a routine mammogram. she said to say hello. she is going to positano with your brother's family.
how nice.
positano is beautiful. remember when we were there, rex? we stayed in the santo pietro? that hotel on the cliff?
so, miles. if you have a proposal, let's hear it.
at this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
my client has ruled that out.
my client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
that is delusional.
my client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
my client feels sufficiently dispassionate.
my client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
ha ha.
heh heh.
-- so much for the icebreakers. what are you after, ruth?
my client is prepared to settle for fifty percent of the marital assets.
why only fifty percent, ruth? why not ask for a hundred percent?
oh brother. here we go.
why not a hundred and fifty percent?
yes. maybe you are right, miles. maybe we are being too conservative. seventy five percent.
do you need a tagamet?
you have some?
these are yours.
not according to mrs. rabinow.
have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
sometimes i forget.
I am sorry. where were we?
we were about to request the primary residence, and thirty percent of the remaining assets.
are you familiar with kirshner?
kirshner does not apply. kirshner was in kentucky.
what is kirshner?
please -- let me handle this. okay, ruth, forget kirshner -- what is your bottom line?
i think that went as well as could be expected.
she always looked out for me.
and she had private investigators assisting her.
she brought my digestive enzymes.
in anticipation of making you sick.
maybe i should reconsider my...
i do not know what his game is. he dismissed every one of ruth's proposals. and sarah, we were not unreasonable.
well what does he want?
i do not know. ruth kept her cool, but i could tell she was surprised.
he has a reputation for being tough.
lilly's up.
oh, god!
every week --
I am dying.
anyway, even rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. if i did not know better, I would swear massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
so where are you now?
well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we are in court.
shit.
get this! he called and invited me to dinner.
i assume this is on rex?
is not everything?
your husband told me you were beautiful, but i was unprepared.
"dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
do you have a hard heart, marylin.
did you see the tape?
not yet.
see the tape. then we can discuss my heart.
tell me mr. massey. what was your performance about this afternoon?
what does your lawyer think?
ruth says you have been too successful, that you are bored, complacent, and you are on your way down.
but you do not agree?
how do you know?
why would you be here?
i told you. i was hungry.
I will have the tournedos of beef. and the lady will have the same?  i assume you are a carnivore.
i know you do.
"who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
you did not ask me here to pick me up. you could get in trouble for that.
not really. you are not my client. freedom of association. big issue with the first amendment fans. want to go to hawaii for the weekend?
have you ever been married, miles?
no.
you do not believe in it.
as a matter of fact, I am a huge fan.
you just have not met the right person.
no. i haven't. have you?
all right, miles. let me tell you everything you think you know. i was married to rex for a long time. i was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. there was only one thing i did wrong during the five years we were together. i got five years older. think he should be able to ditch me for that?
he wants a reconciliation.
see the tape. then we can discuss reconciliation. rex screwed up and i nailed his ass. now I am going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. then I am getting on with my life. that is all I am after.
gotcha.
what is it you are after, miles?
oh, I am a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
well, do not look at mine!
i was devastated. of course.
thank you, mrs. rexroth.
objection, your honor!
grounds?
uh... poetry recitation.
...arty farty!
rephrase. mrs. rexroth, have you ever been in love?
yes. i loved my husband, rex.
and you have always loved him?
and you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
yes. why is that so difficult for you to understand?
who is next, mrs. rabinow.
we rest, your honor.
mr. massey?
who is that?
jesus.
now, mrs. banderas. what is your relationship to mrs. rexroth.
we do not have much of a relationship anymore. i have not seen her since before she married rex. we had some very nice times prior to that. we were quite close.
is this a lover?
please!
and how would you define your relationship to mrs. rexroth. you know -- you are her...?
mother?
hi, sweetie.
hard to believe i know. I am sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.
he will regret this.
have you ever met mr. rexroth?
no. i haven't. but I have been out of town.  hello, rex. hello there.
you were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
no. uh uh. i do not think so. hmm? no. well... no.
objection, your honor. this is not about mrs. rexroth's filial obligations.
sustained.
did you know mrs. rexroth was married?
of course. of course she was married. what else would she be? single? i do not think so.
let me tell you something about patty.
who is "patty."
oh. that is her name. patricia. like mine. i was pat and she was patty. but she changed it after seeing "some like it hot." to marylin. after marylin monroe.
i see. and what were you going to tell us about patty slash marylin?
when she was a tiny girl? and people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? she never said the usual things little girls say -- like -- nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? she always said --  "when i grow up, i want to be divorced."
divorce was her childhood aspiration?
well, not just divorce. she used to say "i want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." and i guess her dream is coming true.  I am happy for you patty
it was like that scene in the godfather. frankie pentangeli is called to testify against the family. and he is in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his brother. they brought the brother from sicily. and frankie can not say a word. he can not testify. that is what it was like seeing pat in there. i could not even have ruth cross examine her.
why do you think she did it?
maybe she wanted a free trip to la. maybe they offered her money. massey is very seductive. who knows.
maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
that stinks. they left you with absolutely nothing. it makes you wonder about the entire legal system. like rodney king.
they bought her speech. if i was only in it for rex's money, he should not have to give me any.
that does not make sense. it is like punishing you for being goal oriented.
well, you can live here as long as you want. do you have any plans?
nothing specific, but I will have my own place soon.
so, marylin. is that what you said when you were a little girl?
probably. every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. what was i supposed to say. anthropologist?
i begged you to have a baby!
in the godfather, after the courtroom scene, frankie pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
you are not...
no. I will see some blood before this is over, but it will not be mine.
she got absolutely nothing. zero. zip.
so. i will not be seeing her? your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
not this one. not unless her hmo covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
everyone needs plastic surgery. you need it.
i do not need it.
you want botox?
what the hell is botox?
it is a form of botulism. i just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can not raise them...
why in god's name would i want...?
no frown lines.  new watch?
it is a lecoultre revers. you can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
why would you need two time zones? you never leave beverly hills.
it was a gift from a client.
set one side for bel air.
botox. christ. we had aspirations when we were in college.
we did not.
you were going to be a cardiac surgeon. i was going to clerk for the supreme court.
i was going to play golf. you were going to have asian girlfriends.
denial is not a river in egypt.
you are in check.
i should be in therapy.
yes. your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. and, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. but bonnie, who is the real victim here? let me suggest the following. your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
well, i would not say --
your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
he --
please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
they hate each other --
so he says now! but if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own... as for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, was not it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?
herb wants to see me?
when you have a moment.
mr. massey --
please! no calls! I am feeling very fragile.
I am sorry, mr. massey, but i felt certain you would want to know -- marylin rexroth wants to see you.
marylin rexroth? when does she --
she is here now.
miles, how nice of you to see us -- may i introduce howard d. doyle of doyle oil.
i told you we know each other, baby. mr. massey represented my ex-brother- in law. martin reiser?
oh. right. will not you have a seat?
after you, doll.
and how is mrs. reiser?
few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. naturally, she misses her kids. six weekends a year and alternate yom kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
so she is uh, flourishing?
she makes felt wallets. got one right here.
yeah. i know. leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
miles, i know you are busy and that you charge by the hour so I will come to the point. howard and i are planning to marry.
muh -- well, uh -- huh?
yep. my divorce just came through. shoulda called you. coulda cut a better deal! my wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. but, i do not know. guess I am just a softie. after all amanda and me were together for -- what -- you would know better than me, marylin. she was your best friend.
sixteen years? howard jr. is fourteen and mandy must be what -- twelve?
here. got pictures.
i... uh guess congratulations are in order.
well -- marylin and rex broke up and...
honey, i do not think this is really relevant to...
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. just a shoulder to cry on deal. one thing leads to another and before i know it --
-- we realized we would always been very attracted to one another.
no!
i had no idea until after, but --
baby. you are so hot!
howard!
what a touching story.
you know, miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. this might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, massey, but...  i like my women with two boobs.
as you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation my motives were questioned. i was slandered in court.
you did good, massey!
therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet howard -- i wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
and -- there is no talking her out of it. believe me, I have tried.
they say the massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
she said "penetrate." heh heh heh.
oh, for the love of...
that is true, is not it miles? your pre-nup is the best there is?
that is correct. not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at harvard law.
harvard? whoa, daddy!
i just want to make sure that you both --
-- understand what you are asking for here. the massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. no one can profit from the marriage. the pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
well -- at the moment, that would be me.
and without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. no wriggle room.
a wriggle room! maybe we should put that in the malibu house. screw the screening room!
-- and we are sure...
-- we are both sure that is what we want?
absolutely.
course i can not do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
we would better go before we get thrown out.
excuse me, mr. doyle, if i could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
what part?
I would just like to have a word with her.
why not? I am going to have her for a lifetime.
getting married.
to him? he is a sick freak.
he is passionate.
passionate! he is a pervert. he should have to register when he moves.
all girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
marylin! listen to me.
no. you listen to me.  you busted me, miles. you left me with nothing! what did you expect me to do? get a degree in counseling? write a book about table linen? because that is what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I am not quite ready for that.
but why him?
we told you. we realized we have always been in love.
the massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
so i hear. is that all?
no, that is not all.
do you think I am going to end up like herb myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
got any symptoms?
yes. the inability to experience pleasure.
oh. that.  do not waste time with your queen.
what?
the center counter defense. the thing is not to move your queen too early.
she can not really love that idiot, can she?
what?
marylin rexroth. she came into my office and signed a pre-nup with howard doyle.
doyle oil?  a massey pre-nup?  she loves him.
he is the wrong man.
miles! do not waste time with someone else's queen, either.
what the hell is wrong with you?
i can not help it. even with the business we are in, i -- it gets me every time. it is so -- optimistic.
is she going through with it?
what do you think?
what are they?
berry spoons.
spoons! honestly wrigley, I am surprised at you. what is this? some martha stewart suggestion? those are the most cockamamie things I have ever --
miles -- why so angry?
I would like to offer my congratulations. that was a beautiful gesture of howard's.
howard is a beautiful person.
yes. he is a diamond in the rough. and i have a feeling that someday soon you will be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
miles. miles. miles.
i am thrilled for you, but tell me this... how did you get howard to do it? I have addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
it was his idea. it was a gesture of love and trust. be happy for me, miles.
well, when this goes south -- promise you will have dinner with me?
have you tried the duck?
i figure a couple of months. that is how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.
it has bones. be sure to swallow one.
although knowing you as i do -- there will be no settlement. this time it will be complete and total annihilation.
I am sorry I am late. i was having lunch with ruth rabinow's assistant. guess what? marylin rexroth is divorced!
ha!
...and i hear she is richer than croesus.
ah, but is she richer than mrs. croesus?
she could buy and sell you ten times over.
she deserves every penny. they pay great athletes a fortune. well, marylin rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
get me marylin rexroth doyle.
what...?
she owes me a meal.
I would stay away from her, miles.
i know you would, wrigley. but would kramer?
to victory.
i do not feel victorious miles. i feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. i have pictures of him with another woman...
more pictures? my god, marylin. you can open an erotic art gallery.
did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
no. just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
you really think i engineered the whole thing. you think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. you came here to celebrate because you think I am without morality or soul. you --  sound like my mother.
hello?
miles?
yes? marylin?
you are right about me. i am worthless. i am nothing. i do not deserve to live.
marylin? when did i say...?
i do not blame them for betraying me. i do not blame rex, or howard or my father. you see, miles, I am going to tell you something about me. something you may or may not know. i suck!
screw you, asswipe!
marylin? forgive me but are you -- drunk?
a little.  you get out of the car. that is right, fuctard. I am talkin' to you!
you should not be driving. where are you?
I am on sunset. near the beverly hills hotel. wanna meet me for a drink in the polo...?
i live right near there. the 800 block of maple. come here. marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
okay. should i stop at starbucks and pick up a blended for --
no. do not stop.
okay miles.
you have a very nice home, miles. very inviting.
thank you.
you have wonderful art. i love that lithograph. hockney?
yes. i just got that, actually. it was a gift.
from a -- girlfriend.
no. no. i do not have a... no. it was from a client.
no kidding. I will bet you have some very grateful clients. what did rex buy you?
rex sent me two humidors full of pre- castro cubans.
is that you?
me. yes.
oh. and that is -- mom?
yeah. mom. mom and brother.
you look like you were a very sensitive child. you have expressive eyes.
hmmm...
and your mother was very beautiful. she must be proud of you.
she never particularly cared for me.
she did not love you?
no. she loved me. she would never not love her son. she just didn't... i was not her "type." she said i was a very, colicky baby. you know? difficult. not a good sleeper? did not eat well? we got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
she held that against you?
apparently she was very disappointed.
boy. boy, oh boy.
and here i thought my mother was...
your mother was.
oh right. you met patricia.
we are damaged goods.
no, we are not!
we are, miles. you know I am right. there is something "off" about you and me miles. and maybe it is not because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. maybe...
that is bullshit! mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. i can not believe you are saying this, marylin! there is nothing wrong with us. we are attractive and charismatic and successful and... i like us.
I am sorry miles. you should not listen to me. I am sure you have a very fulfilling life. I would better go. I am depressing.
no.
thank you for the coffee. it is very robust.
friends?
do not go. stay with me for a while.
i have to say -- I am speechless. no. I am never speechless.
I am a little embarrassed. I am not used to losing control with such -- volume.
and I am not used to -- marylin -- there is something i want to ask you.
what is it miles?
i want... i want to...
i want to be your -- your wife.
huh?
no... that was not right. i want you to be my wife.
did you just propose to me?
yes. i am. what else could those words mean? i believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. and we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, marylin. you have more experience at this than i do.
yes.
yes? yes, you do have more experience?
yes, miles. i accept.
you do?
do you want me to sleep on it?
no.
do you want to sleep on it?
no ma'am. i have been asleep all my life up to this moment. marylin, will you marry me?
yes. again.
i do not have a ring!
i know.
i have a watch.
I am happy for you, pal.
thanks, buddy.
is she asian?
asian? no.
well... I am still...
wrigley?
miles.
kenneth this is my associate, wrigley. wrigley this is my friend, dr. beck.
the plastic surgeon! i read about you in la style.
do you have it?
i have it.
you have the pre-nup?
no. i have the ring. was i supposed to have a pre-nup?
no. you have the ring. wrigley has the pre-nup.
oh. i thought maybe --  gee!
sarah sorkin. ramona barcelona -- this is miles massey.
hello miles.
i tried to reach ruth, but we could not get her.
we wanted ruth here for your protection as well --
the judge is here. over here, judge munson.
was not she the judge at my divorce hearing?
yes. short notice you know, but i think there is nice closure to it. hello judge muson. a pleasure as always.
yes.  it is for your protection, sweetheart. you are the one with the -- the...
-- the coin?
no. judge -- just a sec. but marylin, if we sign it, i can not hope to benefit from the marriage.
oh miles!
what i mean is, your wealth is completely protected.
but?
i want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. that is all I have ever wanted.
but marylin, without this, you are completely exposed.
i want to be exposed.
you are vulnerable.
it is about time.
extinguish?
should we counsel fear -- or trust? should we seek to destroy -- or to build? should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
I am sorry. I am squishing you. I will move to the...
no. stay. i want you close to me. this couch is wrong. it is not a "married couch."
honey, i could sit...
in fact, this is not a married house -- it is a bachelor pad.
hardly. you have six bedrooms
i know. but I have converted most of them into ridiculous "guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. woman things. personalize it. marylinize it. make this your house.
here's my card. spend as much as you want. we get mileage.
well, i suppose i could "girly" it up for you with a little fortuny, and some passementerie --
good.  are those foods?
fabric and fringe.
exactly. and then -- maybe -- not right away -- there is a room right off the bedroom -- it would be perfect for a nursery.  it is a walk in humidor right now -- but if i took out the refrigeration unit --
miles.
i think a nursery should be right off the master suite. my parents put mine in the guest house. apparently they did have a fisher price intercom, but my mother turned it off when i was seven months old because i was so --
you said 'yes' did not you?
i said yes.
is this ming?
it is not ming. it is tong.
is tong older than ming?
i think ming is older than tong.  what is this?
i can not do this anymore. let's get some lunch.
what about rugs? i thought we were stopping at mansour?
right.
well. he said to "make the house mine."
oh boy. if he only knew.
yeah. i guess. you know --
what?
he is not what i expected. he is very -- he is so -- happy.
but you are going through with it?
yes, yes, it is just -- you know I have never been the first wife. rex was married before me.
so what?
miles is different. he is still so idealistic.
well, that is about to change big time.
he has no cynicism or anger. for once I am not the repository of rage at some other woman.
soon, you will have your own rage!
i guess.
wait. i know you.
yes?
you are miles massey! you probably do not recognize me. the drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair.
excuse me?
you ruined my life you sonofabitch. gimme those.
yes, i know howard doyle.
he tricked you. with a phony wife and a fake pre-nup. howard doyle. he got you. you married marylin, did not you? you thought she had money. ha ha ha. howard doyle made you think that because of what you did to me. and to marylin rexroth. yeah. i heard all about it. my brother howard doyle got you.  neener neener neener.
he divorced his wife -- he married marylin -- he divorced marylin -- and he -- remarried his wife? what kind of sick --
marylin was friends with howard and amanda doyle. they do not like the way you operate. they helped her.
he never ate the pre-nup, did he!
i have no idea what howard doyle eats. I am not a damn dietician.
did marylin end up with money?
she is your wife. why do not you ask her? anyway, i assume she signed the highly over rated massey pre-nup.
i do not have a pre-nup
...the fault, dear brutus, is not in our stars...
do not give me that crap. that is my crap.
and it is good!
I will have you suspended. I will have you disbarred.
do not threaten me, miles. i did nothing illegal.
...why did she do it, ruth? why?
that is attorney client privilege.  sorry, miles. but as a great and clever man once said, what is good for the goose --
hi.
hello marylin.
i have a surprise for you.
i bet.
you do not like me?
i love you. i want to have your baby.
what is wrong miles? did i spend too much?
miles. i have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. i can return everything.
can you marylin? can you return the trust? can you return the hopes? the dreams? can you just...  send it all back for store credit?
miles? you are scaring me.
I am sorry, darling. i love it. it is chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. it is you, marylin. it is you.
they will not get a conviction. the husband called it in as a suicide. the forensic guys were not thinking murder. I am sure some of the evidence was compromised.
it is your move, miles.
i already made my move, kenneth.
it sounded like a bell.
I will be right back.
forgery and fraud?
you used his credit card.
he told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
quite a little shopping spree. how do you spend six figures in less than six hours? oh, never mind I have seen it before. I have seen everything.
do you think he set me up? do you think that was his intention?
like i know his intention? or yours for that matter?  i should join sam. I am too old for this bullshit.
he never even asked. he just assumed --
he was right, was not he?
so. now what?
now? well, marylin, now you cut a deal or find out how jean harris made it work for her.
well. well. well. look who made bail!
may i come in?
i do not know. maybe i should grab my mace. I am a civil attorney. i have little experience with "the criminal mind."
I would just like to pick up a few of my things
i do not believe you have "things."
on the contrary. we are married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
comfy!
what do you want?
i want to nail you ass.
are you threatening me, because I am sure that is a violation of the terms of your bail.
I am reporting you to the irs.
the irs? they owe me. I am expecting a refund.
I am clean with the irs. I have reported every dollar I have ever made. try again, girlfriend.
I am not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I am talking about --
stuff.  got a light?
what kind of "stuff?"
arty farty stuff.  lithographs and pre castro cubans. watches and mileage on private jets. stuff, miles. stuff you get from grateful clients.
those are gifts.
salary. unreported income.  by the way, what time is it on bellagio road?
you can not prove anything.
i do not have to. that is what the irs guys do. and they do it with great zeal. see, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. and they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel wrath.  what is this? a romeo and julieta?
you are out of your league, marylin. rexroth was a primate. I am a professional.
i know. so am i, right? and so is agent wilson of the internal revenue service. he is a dedicated, underpaid graduate of southwestern university -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he is dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  i think it is only fair to warn you: I am going to file an action, miles. and after a decent interval i plan to have ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
meaning my house.
i believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
drop the bogus forgery charge and I will forget about your generous friends slash clients.
that is blackmail.
that is marriage.
i am here representing mr. dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
who is the pigeon?
excuse me?
who do you want me to kill?
well -- i, uh, that is to say mr. dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of marylin rexroth doyle massey uh dumbart -- uh, massey.
is that... one person?
here's her picture...
you are in a rush.
mr. dumbarton is, yes.
my god.
what?
that was marvin untermeyer.
yes?
he was rex rexroth's personal attorney.
what do you mean, was.
rex just had a massive coronary. in the middle of a business meeting. he is dead.
I am sorry to hear that. but you were not close, were you?
marvin says that rex's will is four years old. he never redrafted it.
yes.
she is rich. we are still married. we have no pre-nup.
so, that is good, right?
who was that?
that was -- oh, shit. what if he is on his way over there?
huh?
marylin! what have i done?
i do not know, but do not call me marylin.
hello?
marylin?
miles? miles! where have you been? I have been trying to get in touch.
you have to leave the house immediately!
i will, miles. i will leave. but miles --
no buts. now. out.
just listen to me. I am sorry, miles. it is true that my initial intention was to...
please! leave the house.
i fell in love miles.
so did i. now pack up a few basics and --
you do? you do love me?
whoever sent you, I will pay double.
mr. dumbarton.
is this mr. dumbarton?
no...
that is his lawyer.
triple!
who is the pigeon?
it is a no go, joe.
marylin!
it is okay joe.
wait! he works for you?
now. but first, he worked for you.
you were going to have this thug...?
wait just a second there. you sent him here. you unearthed this pestilence.
you are calling me a pestilence? that is a hoot!
I am sorry. that was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  did you really mean what you said on the phone. it was not because you found out about rex?
nonono. marylin -- I am your husband. I would be entitled to rex's money. no matter what happened to you.
that is true.
lemme tell you something. you are the pestilence. I am the exterminator.
oh joe, be happy for us. I will pay you the twenty thousand.
well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
shut up. i was a lawyer. just like you. and my clients? whores just like you.
marylin. run. I will distract him.
I am not leaving you. i took self defense
hello marylin.
hello miles.
hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
it is not something i wanted either.
but then -- i guess -- something inside me died when i realized that you would hired a goon to kill me.
yes. i know. it is exactly how i felt when i realized you would hired the goon to kill...
where does that leave us?
we have outlined a settlement...
you wounded me first, marylin.
your forgetting rex rexroth?
you are forgetting howard doyle?
forgery? fraud?
income tax evasion?
murder?
murder!
i do not see how we can ever find our way back from...
pre-castro.
fine. they were created during a dictatorship.  what if something happened to you? what would i tell little gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
sweet.
i thought so.
