well, if it isn't the little frenchman!  how is the little frenchman?
fine!
you don't mind if i go instead, do you?
no...
if you did mind, you'd tell me, wouldn't you?
roberto?  how long?
six seconds.
you shouldn't dive everyday, papa.
then you shouldn't eat everyday, jacques.
hey!  have you ever seen a mermaid?
no.
why don't you ask me?
what?
where i saw the mermaids?!  why don't you ever ask any question? i'm always the one asking the question!  we're sitting here like two stones and i'm taking to myself. ask me something, goddamnit!
how did it happen?
the company asked me to extract everything i could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, i fucked up!  can you help?
how many are, down there?
ten thousand.
lira?
dollars.
you're going to hold me up at a time like this?
in my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
what does that mean?
enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
have the car painted.
santini will do that for 25 dollars!
then tell him to wax it too.
enzo, really.  what are you going to get?
a rosary for mama, a dress for
yes?
find the frenchman.  find me mayol.
don't you have a heater?
yeah... sure... is this your first trip to peru?
does anybody live to make a second?
a drink to warm up?
yes, thank you.  intravenous if possible.
tea... or whiskey?
... both.  did i just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
who?
the guy in the halloween suit!
who... who is that?
mayol... jacques mayol.
that's the experiment?  dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
... the truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  we weren't able to save the equipment.
i'll have to talk to the driver.
in the spring when he melts!
my dear, science is a cruel mistress.
but... how is he going to breathe?
he isn't going to breathe.
he's in the fluoroscope now.  listen to his heart.  impressive, huh? the flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and doesn't even feed the limbs anymore.  it's a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
how long can he stay down?  without breathing?
it depends.  he should come up soon.  unless he's decided to stay for the night.
why is he doing this?
for one thing, it's his job... as for the rest of it, i wish i knew.
shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
coffee might be nice.
will he understand spanish?
his mother's an american.  he spent half of his life in the states. i'd try english if i were you.
i recognize you.
we saw each other a little while ago.
in the lake?
no... in the hut.
i changed the lock you son of a bitch!
... sally?
you're back!  hello.  we were burgled.
again?
they got the new t.v.
... and the new stereo.
i hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
yep.  how was your trip...?  help me clean up, okay?
you called the police?
they're going to send detectives.
well?
what?
how was your trip?
nice... very interesting... great!  ... i guess.
okay... who'd you meet?
it's his heartbeat.
oh jesus...!  i'll make some coffee.  they left the stove.
i thought you said he was peruvian?
haven't you been listening?
... since eight o'clock last night...!  you're in love.
don't be a jerk.  there's no such thing as love at first sight.
jacques, my friend, how are you?
enzo...
that's good.  you never would have recognized me, huh?  check out the suit! looking good, no?  you know i'm the world champion?
yes, i know.
i dove 315 feet!
great!
they say i'm like lazarus.  you know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!
why?
because i'm sure you're dying to beat me.
i don't want to be in any competition... i dive because i like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
no.  all you need is to want to be the best.
you're the best, enzo!
that's too easy!  every time i beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me:  "d'you know that french guy, mayol?  he's supposed to be very good!  too bad he doesn't compete." so, you're going to come with me to taormina! first, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.  ... i'll see you there...
this is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete.  could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
what kind?
johana, am i boring you?
sorry.  of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  what did you say?
i said that the file is incomplete.
did the driver really freeze?
like a popsicle.  they're keeping him on a stick until spring.
my god!  i'm glad i didn't go.
... so am i.
okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  we can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  okay?
okay, okay.  you'll have it by the end of the week, how's that?
you've made me a happy insurance person.
then, goodbye.
wait!  professor...?
... yes?
listen, i just found out we've got real problems in sicily!
what d'you mean?
the mafia!  la cosa nostra!
what's happened??
the documents are forged.
no!
yes!  the notary is a phony.  he has the same signature as the contractor!
it can't be true!
we have to send somebody over there immediately!  if we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. we'll be off the hook.  there's a flight to rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to sicily.
i'll send cardoza, he'll be able to...
i tried him, he can't go.  his son is being bar mitzvohed tomorrow... i'll go, boss.
i thought it was spanish that you spoke?
italian is practically the same thing.
mayol... mayol... no reservation.
... are you sure?
positive, sir.
this is the hotel san domenico?
yes sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
yes, but... so, you haven't got a room left?
no sir, the hotel is full because of the diving championship.
ah?!
i remember.  hi roberto!
what room have you got?
i don't have one.
you don't have a room?  paolo?  what did i just hear?  i personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend jacques mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
it's okay, enzo.  i'll go somewhere else.
not only is jacques mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  and you're throwing him out!  are you crazy, or what? stupido!
enzo drop it, i'll find something.
... so, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  am i right?
yes, of course.  lots of questions.
well, what are they?
i'm sorry... i don't know how to ask the questions.
that's good.
how do you make a living?  your experiments, does it pay well?
it's okay.
... you married?
no.
me neither, 'cause of my mother. she's a curse, my mamma, a tornado. stubborn as a mule!  i was engaged... for a week.  after that, mamma was so mad, i tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
so, not married.  well, good for you.  you play the field, like me. a girl in every port, huh?
exactly, i mean, after all, we're men!
damn right!  that's what i tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
people say that?
forget it.  i was joking.
i tell you she's mine!
hello!
you know each other?
yes.
enzo molinari.
this is a great pleasure.
johana cross, pleased to meet you.  well!  isn't this a coincidence. i really wasn't expecting this... all the way out here.  it's incredible!
please, have a seat.
thank you.  i wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
no, no!
not at all!
you're staying at the hotel?
i wish, but it's full.  they recommended a pension in town. they say that all of taormina is full.  what's going on here?
it's the free diving world championship.  i am by the way world champion!
but what brought you to sicily?
i was doing an insurance investigation in palermo.  i work for an insurance company.  so, i decided to take a few days off.  i don't know this island at all. it really is gorgeous.
a spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
i think i'll have a coffee.
no, no.  you'll like it.  it's superb.
... okay.  i'll try.
where did you two meet?
in a lake.
i might have known.  as i was telling you earlier, i'm the world champion free diver.
congratulations.
some people say it's the most virile sport in the world.  one has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort...
enzo?
what?
your mother?
ahi, ahi, cazzo!  ma mamia! where...?  god, she'll kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
madame...
... and his friend, johana...
thanks for helping with the bag.  it looks great!
i thought it was a nice place.  isn't it?
i'm being a pain in the ass.  it's beautiful here.
you're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
i don't know... why?
just because... i would have liked to visit the town... see the coast... i don't know anybody... expect for you.
yes... maybe... i don't know.  i don't like competitions... it ruins the fun.  don't you think?
i guess... but you know... i'm american and i've mostly been taught to be competitive... there's always pleasure of being the best?
maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... you see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it.  it's a feeling... i don't know how to say this... voluptuous?
c'mon, you two... jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  we have a new world champion.
i'm a little tired, i don't know if...
get in the car!
what about the shoes?
very chic.  anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
no.
then, it's very chic.  avanti!
i thought you'd be at the dinner.
it's too loud for me.
you look adorable.
thank you...
... especially the sneakers.
a new world record!  that's great! it gives me something to beat tomorrow!  you ever been to tahiti?
no.
i'll take you there.  we'll live in the sun.  you'll cook fresh fish and we'll make love under the coconut trees.
you forgot the hula!
yes, of course, i'll do the hula!
you'll be lovely, but no thanks.  jacques, would you do a native dance for me?
he looks strange, doesn't he? like a baby that just learned to walk.
have you known him long?
forever.  we used to live on the same island in greece, when we were kids.
what was he like, when he was little?
little.  very little.  and skinny, very skinny too.  that is compared to me.
i get it, enzo you were a superior child.
exactly!  what is it johana?  you're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth?!
and just where are you from?
italy!
why?
... for the mermaids.
today at lunch, you asked me if i had any questions.
ah ha.  you finally want to know about women.
why?  are they what's most important?
no... it depends... sometimes they are... what, exactly do you want to know?
... everything.
everything about what?
well... about everything.
why?
if we don't... i'm going to beat you.
huh?  well listen to him!  do you hear that?
no.
he looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "i'm going to beat you".
... that's what he's here for, isn't he?
listen to her!  "that's what he's here for"!  he's here to loose, that's what he's here for.  first of all, i'm unbeatable.  second, how old are you?
two years younger than you.
as i said, second of all you're too skinny.  you've got tiny lungs. i still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
the size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
look at me.  these aren't lungs. these are... tanks.  how long can you hold your breath?
please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
lucky i was there to save you.
you jumped in?
only to help the medics, i assure you.
my wallet.
no.  i want to show you.  is it ruined?
well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... not even for pictures of dolphins...
give it to me.
enzo, wake up!
eh?  si!  avanti!
the medics are looking all over for you.
i'm meditating, can't you see? jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  i can take a five minute nap, can't i?
just checking up on your family.  i guess i was drunker than i thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... well...
i'm glad you stayed.  thank you.
i'd better get back now.
you... you wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
... no?
no?  huh?  yes, of course!!
how can you tell it's a female?
... the way she moves.
she's not like the others.  she can't stand to be away from the sea.
how do you know that?
i don't know, i just feel it.
tonight we're having a little party among ourselves.  8 o'clock in my suite?
okay.
tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
because pasta should be eaten "al dente".  so the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
... it's easy.  you go down.  you come up.  ... right, johana?
congratulations, enzo.
don't you agree, jacques?
no, i have to ask you a favor...  you're the only one who'll understand.
... i'm listening.
hey!  will you slow down!  when did you learn how to drive?
driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
and the lights!  running lights, stealing stretchers...!  you'll have us in jail.
enzo, stop bitching, will you?
well, good night, then...
you going to sleep here, all by yourself?
yes...
... it's a comfortable place.
sinister is what i'd call it...! ours is so much cheerful!  why don't you come and stay with me... there's plenty of room in my suite.
the mamma's there too.
yes, the mamma is is there.
good night enzo, good night jacques.
good night.
you don't need a stretcher to take her with you.  you know that, don't you?
what?
the dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
can i come watch you dive tomorrow?
uh... yes, of course!
what are they for?
they're paramedics.  they wait at 180 feet.
if there was a problem, they could do something right?
of course, that's what they're for.
... and those?
those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  they dive with a helium-oxygen mixture.  at that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
what's that little air bottle on the machine?
that isn't for the divers actually. it's for the balloon.  it blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
but doesn't jacques dive without anything?
yes... it's magic.
jacques, you set a world record.
i did?
aren't you happy?  don't you feel proud...?  i feel proud and all i did was watch.
here...  here...
what is it?
little presents, nothing much... i knew it, i just knew it!  look here!
you still collect them?
yes.
you don't have that one, do you?
no.  thank you.  it's really beautiful.
oh it's nothing.  i knew it.  i told roberto "he's very good that little frenchman, very good".  i lost my title but i won a watch!
is it a poem?
no, it's the recipe for spaghetti "frutti del mare".  you see i was right in getting you out here.  you're a world champion, my friend!
i'm going back home.
why?
because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
i'm not from the sea... i don't understand what you're talking about.
yes you do.  you know exactly what i'm talking about.  you're afraid i want to hold onto you, and i do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
but it's not true, i feel good with you... it feels right...
can i come in?
no problem, i enjoy talking in my sleep.
he doesn't like us.
so what!?  his job is to hand out the paychecks.  and he does that very well, let me tell you.
plenty of women everywhere right?
smoking is absolutely forbidden.
it isn't lit yet.
you shouldn't even carry cigarettes on board!
listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
the rules are the rules.
... what's your name again?
noireuter.
and where did you say you were from?
i didn't say...  brussels!
... i was seventeen, i loved her so much i tried to die for her. two years later i couldn't even remember her name!  let me tell you, time erases everything!
i don't want to erase anything.
you'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
... yes.
i give you this.  you're stubborn... dumb, but stubborn.
thank you.
what's with the voice?
it's nothing.  it's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
and... does the voice come back?
for others, yes... for you, who knows?
try speaking to me?
is that alcohol?  are you out of your mind?  alcohol is strictly forbidden.
hey!  d'you have any other complaints?  just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! okay?
... and if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you visa and i'll do the curtains on american express... for the couch there's bloomingdales...  or are you still over your limit?
way past it.
does that have a hidden meaning?
no.  i'm just depressed.
you look it too.  you haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  you haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
i know, i know!  i'm a terrible person...  it's... i'm so damn, damn sad.
what is it honey... the frenchy?
do you think i should have stayed? don't you think maybe i should have stayed?  i've been a jerk, right?  i should have stayed!  i was supposed to be in love... i was in love!  i am in love, why did i act like a bitch?  he went swimming. all the man did was go swimming! i must be crazy.  it was too good to be true.
vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
good afternoon.
i came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
yes.  of course.  very wise.
remember when i went to italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  well, we weren't being cheated by the mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... do they come for lunch everyday? i really went on my own business, to see a man that i happen to be in love with... and i'm glad i did it, but i'm sorry about the policy and i'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now i don't have...  one million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  but if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and i think this is where you fire me?
you're right.  you're fired.
will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  i'm pregnant.
the italian, i presume?
no.  he's french, he was just in italy for the competition.
he seems to have won it.
yes, isn't it wonderful?  i'm so happy.  i'll bet i'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
hello?
it's me... johana.
how are you?
i got fired.
... that's funny... i had this job with enzo... we got fired too.
so have i.  ... hello?
i'm still here.
well, then, talk to me some more.
... it's hard you know.  you're so far away and i don't know what else to say.
then, tell me a story.
uh... ah!  a story?
do you know how it is?  do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
no... tell me.
you go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there...  and you decide that you will die for them... only then do they start coming out.  they come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... if it's sincere.  if it's pure... they will be with you and take you away forever.
hello?
it's me again.
i'm being a pain, huh?
... not at all.
you sure?
absolutely positive.
okay.  in that case... i'm at the airport in nice.
why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
you'll understand.
assassin!
uncle louis, this is my friend johana.
did you buy the cassettes?  the wagner, the berlioz?
i brought johana to meet you.
are you crazy?  i have no use for a woman!  since my accident.
no, no.  johana is visiting me.
bonjour monsieur... louis.
uncle louis.  he's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
i'm very pleased to meet you, uncle louis.
where are you from, henrietta?
johana... new york.
what kind of name is that?  to be named after a city?
he doesn't hear too well.
uncle louis!
no, no.  it's true.  when i was in new york, oh boy!  before my accident, you understand?
good.  that way i'll see more of you... where are you going to stay?
well... here.
in my apartment?
it's my apartment.
liar!  thief!  torturer!  when you were an orphan i nursed you at my breast.
uncle louis, we have a guest!
i'm going to put a lock on the telephone.  did you bring the cassettes?
jacques!  johana!
enzo!
where did you get that?
"that"!  this is not a "that"...
you're going to live here permanently?
... maybe, if jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
he's shy, not like enzo.
yes.  not like enzo.
i think, he's really nice... he's a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
... i'm pregnant, bonita!
are you going to keep it?
yes.
does he know?
no.
maybe you should talk to him about it.
i can't... i just don't know how to...
i was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  you know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the gods.  take leda for example, sleeping with jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... well, can you imagine leda announcing to her swan "you're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
but your man isn't quite a god!
probably not, but i still don't have the nerve to tell him.
well, you're going to have to tell him, sometime!
and you...?  do you love enzo?
very much, i think.  but, there's going to be a problem.
uncle louis, you remember enzo's mother signora molinari from amorgos?
the whale!  how could i forget? always was something fishy about that woman!
what were italians doing living in greece anyway?
louis, we were french!
that's different!  what's the matter with you?
anybody can have a bad day!
i've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
it's never the sea!  it's roberto, mamma, that stupid actress... oh shit!  jacques, what do you know?
and you?
i didn't dive.
you'll try again tomorrow?
i don't know... it didn't feel right.  i'm going to bed.  i'm tired.
what?
... nothing.
you're leaving?
yes...  could you please give this to enzo.
of course.
bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
i don't have the strength to fight off la mamma... anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
did you tell him?
not yet... i'm waiting for the right moment.
... you take care of yourself, johana.
enzo, enzo!  congratulations!
thank you, thank you very much!
what are you doing?
i'm putting you on the coin... your essence... that way you'll always be with me when i dive.
that's good.
enzo, don't be angry.  i was lucky... that's all.
jacques...?
you go back, i'll walk.
what's wrong?
it's nothing.  just the long trip. i'm a little jet-lagged.
you want to lie down for a while?
no, i'll be fine.  can you just hand me a glass of water?
is he here?
he's training.
okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
what are you doing here?
checking out the competition.
enzo, why do you guys do this?
what else is there?
you know what i'm talking about.
you risk your life when you cross the street.
damn it!  why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
because you'd laugh.
i won't, i swear.
i dive in search of god.  if i go deep enough i'm going to find him.
a little... you think it's the same for jacques?
no.  jacques is a creature of the sea.  he isn't meant to live on earth, among us... you should know this, johana.
he can learn.  he is learning.
you really think so?  did you tell him you were pregnant?
how do you know that?
you told bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
... not yet.
don't.
why?
because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  and he's only waiting for one thing:  that some god up there will turn him into a fish! how long has that moron been down there?
five minutes and fifty seconds.
that idiot!
is he alright?  what happened?
the fool was asleep!  if i weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! is that who you want to live with?
... how long was i asleep?
long enough to die.  listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
... when you dive... with that machine... what does it feel like?
... the feeling of slipping without falling... the hardest is once you are at the bottom.
why?
because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... and i always have a hard time finding one.
i'm concentrating.
we can't dive anymore.  they want to cancel the competition for a while.
it's not safe, they say.  the doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live.  free diving is over as a sport.
you say that because you have the title!
no!  i would never cheat you.
well that's very nice of you.
you were right.
... i was right about what?
... it is much better down there. it's a better place.
... push me back in the water...
i can't.
jacques, take me back down... please.
i'll go see how he's doing.
let him sleep.
you've got to tell me what happened?
i saw how it has to be.
jacques?  i'm pregnant.
that's good... that's wonderful. it's wonderful for you.
you are the father.
promise me one thing.
anything.
promise you won't forget me.
