you planned this whole thing, didn't you?
where's the fucking money?
we make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
all part of the business.
all part of the business.
hi.  my name is violet.  we sort of met in the elevator --
yeah, sure.  i'm corky.
i heard you working in here and i just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee?
who?
rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
oh, he went home to india, but as far as i know he'll be back.
so this is temporary for you?
pretty much.  one day at a time.
i guessed you were straight black.
good guess.
mmmm ...  thanks, i needed this.
my pleasure ...  but to be honest, i did have a slightly ulterior motive here.  i was wondering if i could ask a small favor?
a favor?
yeah, see, i'm kind of a night person, so i was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
oh, i'm sorry --
no, it isn't your fault.  the walls here are just so thin.
are they really?
yes, it really causes problems. sometimes it's like you're in the same room.  but if it's too much trouble, i understand ...
no, no trouble.  there's other work to do.
you're doing everything yourself?
yeah.
that is so amazing.  i'm in awe of people who can fix things.  my dad was like that.  we never had anything new.  whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  his hands were magic.
truck.
truck.  of course.
'63 chevy.
i knew it.
so, how do you know the owner, mr. bianchinni?
i don't, really.  i was referred to him.
oh, really.
do you know him?
no, but caesar does.  he likes him. says he's a good italian.
caesar is your husband?
oh no, no.  i'm not the marrying kind.
i should be going.  you can drop the cup off anytime.
thanks.
my pleasure.
oh no.  shit.  i didn't know he would call you.  god, you must think |i'm a total nuisance.
not exactly.
i'm sorry, i usually would call rajeev, but i didn't know what to do so i called mr. bianchinni.
he said you lost something.
yeah, come on in.
i'm sorry, look, forget it.  i shouldn't have called...
i told bianchinni i would take a look.  is it that sink?
do you have a pot or a bucket?
sure.
thank you so much.  you have to let me pay you something --
no.  mr. bianchinni asked me to do it.  i did it.
okay, one drink.
what do you want?
a beer?
a beer.  of course.
you seem uncomfortable.  do i make you nervous, corky?
no.
curious, maybe.
curious?  that's funny, i'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
are you surprised that i know what it is?
maybe.
i have a tattoo, would you like to see it?
isn't it obvious?  i'm trying to seduce you.
why?
because i want to.  i've wanted to since i first saw you in the elevator.
you dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
if i say yes, will you take your hand away?
no.
...  yes.
i didn't expect --
what the fuck is going on?
oh, shit ...
caesar, this is corky.  corky, caesar.
i'm sorry, christ, i thought ... it's fucking dark in here.
you're helping rajeev?
no.  rajeev's in india.
she's doing the work herself.
no shit.  bianchinni hired you?  you know he's a good friend of mine. |family, really.
so, you just got out?
jesus, caesar!
what?  it ain't no big fuckin' deal. i know who don hires.  did you know he did time himself?
how many'd you do?
five.
not bad.  what for?
that's none of your goddamn business, caesar.
you're right.  you don't have to tell me, if you don't want to.  i just hope you understand you're among good people here.
good.  i hate to worry.  i got ulcers.
i should be going.
what?  how about a drink?
my brushes, i have to clean my brushes.  thanks, though.
another time.
sure.
i had to see you.
look, i don't think this is a good idea.
i wanted to apologize.
don't apologize, please.  i can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
...  i needed that.
tell me about it.
caesar's mafia, isn't he?
you have to ask?
no.
funny, nobody calls it that anymore. caesar calls it "the |business."
how did you meet him?
they took over a club i was working at.  caesar started managing it.
he's a launderer?
basically.
how long have you been with him?
almost five years.
five years is a long time.
yes, it is.
the redistribution of wealth.
what?
isn't that what you wanted to know? what i did time for?
the redistribution of wealth?
that's what i tell someone when i'm trying to get them in my bed.
i'm already in your bed.
my cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught.  she was always more honest than me.
you didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.
i guess i wanted to.
i'm glad you did.
so am i.
what's wrong?
nothing.
yes there is.  i felt it this morning when i brought you the coffee.
shit, here we go.
you didn't want to see me, did you?
if there is one thing i can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
what are you afraid of?
i'm not afraid of anything.
i don't understand - ?
i know!  you can't understand, because we're different, violet.  we're different.
we're not that different, corky.
how can you sit in that bed and say that?
because it's the truth.
let me guess.  this is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  that inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
oh no, she's nothing like you.  she's a lot smarter than you.
is that what her daddy tells her?
i know what i am.  i don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
what are you saying?  that you don't have sex with men?
i don't.
for christ's sake, violet!  i heard you!  thin walls, remember?
what you heard wasn't sex.
what the fuck was it?
all my life, everyone has been telling me that when i have sex, i'm not really having sex.  not real sex. but they're wrong.  i know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
what was it then?
work.
we make our own choices and we pay our own prices.  i think we're more alike than you want to admit.
what about that guy this morning?
you mean shelly?
don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
no.  shelly knows what i am.  he saw me in a bar with another woman.
i suppose he just wants to watch.
fuck it!  i think you better leave.
i think so, too.
whoa, whoa.  come on, he's making too much noise.
you hear that, bitch?  be quiet!
here, put this in his mouth.
caesar, i'm leaving.
what?  oh, come on, i didn't use one of the good towels.
caesar, i'm serious.  this is too much.  i have to get out of here.
why?  'cause you know him?
now why don't you go watch some tv or something?
are you okay, violet?
mickey, why is johnnie here?  you know how i feel about that fucking psycho.
caesar, didn't i tell you to get something?
sure, mickey.  sure.
you shouldn't have to see this.  why don't you get out of here?  go for a walk.
caesar wants me to stay.
don't worry about caesar.  i'll handle caesar.  you just get out of here, okay?
shelly was skimming from the business. he came to see me yesterday because he was afraid caesar figured it out. he wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
even though he knew about you?
yes.
he was in love with you, right?
that's what he told himself.  but it wasn't even about me, it was about caesar.  he wanted what caesar had. that's how they are.  i understand them.
for shelly, taking the money was a way to take from caesar.  he could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.
sounds like he wanted to get caught.
maybe he did.  he would brag to me all the time.  he was never afraid of caesar because he didn't know him.  not like i do.
caesar lives for these moments.  he tells me it's just the business, but i know it's more than that.  he likes it.  the violence.  i'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars.  he says they remind him who he his.  they're all like that. except maybe mickey.
mickey?
he's the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be. |but mickey doesn't like it like they do.  i suppose that's why he's good at it.
i want out.  i want a new life.  i see what i've been waiting for, but i need you, corky.
for what?
you made a choice once.  do you think you would make that same choice again?
what choice?
if those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register?
caesar is going to get the money and bring --
how much money?
shelly said it was over two million dollars.
caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |shelly's books to figure out how he did it.
wait a minute.  wait a minute.  do you have any idea what you are saying? you are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
these people are serious, violet. if you want to know how serious, ask shelly.  they're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.  you fuck them, you've got to do it right.
that's why i need your help.  you said you were good.
i am, but ...
all right, let's say for the moment that i believe everything you are saying.
you think i'm lying?
i didn't say that, but since you did, let's say that you are.  it would have been easy to set shelly up.  you could have got him killed knowing that caesar would bring the money to the apartment.
all you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
is that what you think?
i'm just making a point.  you have no idea what you're asking.  how much trust two people need to do something like this.
the difference is, i can have sex with someone i just met, someone i hardly know, but to steal i need to know someone like i know myself.
do you think you know me like that?
i think ...
caesar, what happened?
it was unbelievable!  un-fucking- believable!
just look at this mess i got to deal with.
what are you going to do with it?
i told them to run it through the cycles.  but i guess gino has plans for it because he's coming here tomorrow night to pick this shit up.
where the hell's the laundry detergent?
ummm ...  in the linen closet.
you said he washed the money?
yeah.
then what?  exactly.
he hung it up.
what?
to let it dry.
and where is it now?
in his office.  i saw it this morning.
it's in a case, on his desk.
does the case lock?
yes.
good.
all right, now, tell me about johnnie.
johnnie?
it sounded like he and caesar don't like each other.
like each other?  they hate each other.
why?
it started way before i was around. i think basically it's because he thinks johnnie is a complete idiot. but johnnie runs chicago because gino is his father.
who is gino?
gino marzzone.
marzzone?  as in angelo marzzone, head of the marzzone family?
that's his brother.
...  shit.
gino marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
yeah.
and johnnie is his son, that's johnnie marzzone?
yeah.
sweet jesus.
gino marzzone is coming to your apartment.  it's a big deal, isn't it?  that means caesar will be ready. he doesn't want to look like an idiot. gino has been there before?
yeah, twice.
what happened?
not much, really.  caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |the first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
does johnnie hit on you?
johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
has caesar ever seen him?
he does it right in front of him.
it's getting better and better. keep going.
gino doesn't know english, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much.  he gets right to the point.  both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
what did gino drink?
scotch, glenlivet.  i remember that caesar made a huge deal about it.
what time did you say they would be there?
the plane is in at seven, so i'd say about eight.
any bodyguards?
gino travels with a big man named roy.  caesar calls him the driver.
fine.
we want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
poor boy, has to work so hard.
where will you be?
waiting in the apartment next door.
and as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
an accident.
shit!  oh shit!
fuck!  fuck!  how did you ...  awwww goddammit!
i'm sorry.  it was an accident.
don't worry, i'll get some more.
there's no time.
don't be silly, caesar.  it'll take five minutes.
what if he sees you?
he won't.
you can't know for certain that he won't see you.
trust me, violet.
i'm just asking, what if?
if he does ...
there is no going back.
when i get the scotch, how do i know you won't take off?
the same way i'll know that you went to scotch.  trust.
i still don't see how i'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  everyone will think i did it.
not caesar.
why?
because of what you are going to tell him.  you have to make it as real as you can.  the moment you open the door with the scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
if it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.
c!  shit, i'm sorry!
they were early.
what are you talking about?
they just left, didn't they?
what are you, drunk?
you mean they weren't up here?
no!  they're still on their way.
that doesn't make any sense.
why?
because i just saw johnnie downstairs.
what?
i was getting out of the car when i saw him in the mercedes.
it couldn't have been.
it was him.  i'm positive.
it's impossible!
caesar, i know johnnie.  it was him. i screamed when i saw him.  i couldn't believe i missed them.  i knew you were going to be upset so i thought i'd apologize and give gino the scotch.  i honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
he'll have to run.
if he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
you'll be clean and we'll be rich.
jesus, that's beautiful.
thank you.
if you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. it's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
i had a partner and she fucked me.
i won't.
i think we're going to find out.
why?  why would johnnie do this?
jesus christ, violet!  open your fucking eyes!  johnnie hates me like i hate him!
i hate that little fuck!  i hate him!  i hate him!  i should've done him!
but you know he did it.
so what?!  so fucking what?  use your head, violet.  the money is gone.  gino is coming here to get it.  you think he's going to believe me if i tell him his piss-hole son stole it!  is that what you think? i don't.  you know what i think?  i think i'm a dead man.  i'm one in the brain.  that's what i think!
caesar, what are we going to do?
got to think this through ...
caesar, maybe we should run --
violet, please!
i mean it, caesar, forget johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
goddammit, violet!  would you just leave me the fuck alone!  please! leave!  now!
all right, caesar.
it's me.
what happened?
he totally freaked.  i've never seen him like this.  he's out of his fucking mind.
that's okay, as long as he believes it was johnnie.
believes it!  jesus, it's driving him crazy.  he wants to kill him.  i don't know, corky, i don't know what he is going to do.  i'm getting nervous, really nervous.
it's all right, violet.  it's working. all we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
what if he doesn't run?
that means he probably will kill johnnie.
oh, christ, i got to get out of here!
listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  you're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
okay, all right.
we're almost there, violet.  just hang on.
i got it!  i know what i got to do! i got to get the money.
the money?  the money's gone.
no.  johnnie's got it.  all i got to do is get it back.
but it could be anywhere.
he didn't have that much time.  he had to pick up gino.  i bet you he's got it with him.  i bet it's in the car.
he didn't see you, did he?
no.
see, right now he doesn't know that i know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  he wants me to hand the case to gino.  then there is no doubt it was me.  gino will put a bullet in me himself.  but it ain't going to happen.  i won't let it! johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  not like this!  no way!
this is insane!
you can't leave.
the hell i can't!
i need you ...
bullshit!  you don't need me!  you've never needed me!  i can't help you! understand?!  i have to get out.
violet, i won't let you leave.
if you're not with me, violet, then i have to assume you're against me.
caesar, this is crazy.
maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  maybe you dropped the scotch by accident. maybe you didn't.
it would have been so easy to let him in as you went out.
you don't, you can't believe that ...
i've seen the way he looks at you. he's always wanted you.  maybe two million dollars finally bought you.
you shouldn't have hit me.
you want to get into this now?
no, no, caesar.  not now.
hey, caesar!  you take care of this girl, or i find out!
you are as radiant as ever, violet.
glenlivet, right, gino?
i'll have whatever violet's drinking.
no, johnnie.  no goddamned phones. not now.
pop?
caesar, come here.  sit.  we talk now.  you too, johnnie.
we know how this was done, eh?
yeah, i know.
done.  we go now.
jesus christ, pop.  you got two hours until your plane leaves.
so caesar, what did it total out at?
two point one seventy-six.
unbelievable.  can you believe that, violet?
hey, johnnie ...
come on, pop, all i want to know is one thing.  just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it.  i bet it wasn't a big deal.  was it, caesar?
what's that, johnnie?
the money i bet it was nothing to get it clean, after you made such a fucking big deal ...
johnnie, what did i say?
pop, this is important to me.  it's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
where is this going, johnnie?
just admit it, caesar.
admit what?
that you overreacted.  that you lost it.  not me.  it was your mistake.
all right, johnnie, you want to play it this way, i can play it this way. you want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case.
caesar ...
shut up, violet!  this is between me and johnnie.
that's right, i know.  i fucking know.
know what?
open the case!
all right!  where's the key?
you don't need a key.
how the fuck can i open it?
the same way you did before.
what are you talking about?
caesar?  what is this?
ask johnnie!  ask your rat-fuck son!
you don't think i'll do it, do you?
i think you're fucking crazy!
where is it?
where's what?
the money!
caesar, i don't know what you're thinking here, but if you don't put down that gun --
caesar!
gino, your son stole this money to set me up and i can prove it.  violet!
tell them!  tell them!
for christ's sake, johnnie, do what he says.
the next one blows off your dick.
you're a dead man!  a fucking dead man!
where is it?
no, gino!
you aim a gun at me?!  do you know who i am?!  i am gino marzzone.  you understand?
sit down, gino!
no, caesar, gimme the gun.
stay away!
we're family, caesar.
no!
gimme the gun.
i can't.  i can't.
give it to me.
...  maybe three hours.
caesar, what are you going to do?
what do you think we're going to do? we have to find the money.
what?
once we have the money, then none of this ever happened.
caesar, you just killed gino marzzone.
no i didn't.  not if his body disappears and not if the money is still here.  then they never showed up.
what happened to them?
i don't know.  we may never know, but i'm going to guess it was a job, maybe the karpoli family.
fuck.
caesar, what are we going to do?
they're just cops.  stall them as long as you can.
hello?
this is the police, ma'am.
we had a report of gunfire, so if you could --
gunfire?  is this a joke?
no joke, ma'am.  please open the door.
how do i know you are cops?
ma'am, you have to open the door.
all right.
see?  we're for real.
i'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
you did the right thing.
how's it going tonight, fellas?
pretty good, sir.
fuck, this happened before.  it's this shitty ear.  born with it.  the batteries wore out in my aid.  i'm sorry.
it's all right, sir.
not on duty, sorry.
oh, right.
i'm going to make myself a drink, if that's okay?
go right ahead, sir.
this is a beautiful place.
...  thank you.
try to keep the extra batteries for your aid around.
good idea.
fuck!  fuck!  fuck!
caesar, someone could see us out here.
it's not here, caesar.
where, then?
i don't know.  it could be anywhere. we don't even know if he was alone. please, caesar, we don't have much time.  let's get out of here.
what are you doing?
we're going to need some time.
who are you going to call?
yeah?
hey, mickey.
oh, god.
caesar?  what the fuck time is it?
mick, i know it's late, but there is a problem.  they haven't shown up yet.
what?  they ain't there?
no.  i don't know where they are.  i even called over at johnnie's, but no answer.
okay.  let me call around.  i'll see what i can do.  don't go anywhere, okay?
okay, sure, mick.
caesar, you still got the money?
yeah, mick.  i've got the money. i'm staring right at it.
good.  sit tight.  i'll call you.
i can use johnnie's car, dump it in lake michigan ...  i need plastic bags ...  tape and rope ...
just hurry.
oh, thank god.
i'm still here.
i was so afraid you ...
you don't quit on me, violet, and i won't quit on you.
where is the money?
don't tell him --
shut up, violet!
he can't kill you --
violet!
not until he has the money!
now, where the fuck is my money?
lick me.
where is it?
either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
stupid cunt!
caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
don't try to tell me what to do.
you need the money just like we do.
shut up, violet.
let us go and we'll make a deal.
what did she do to you?
everything you couldn't.
i saved you.
ha!  what a load of crap.  look at yourself, caesar.  you're a thug. |you launder money for the mob.  you rent women like you rented this apartment.
saved me?  you don't even know me. you used me, caesar, just like i used you.  all part of the business.
you betrayed me!
you murdered gino!
i had to.  you made me.
bullshit, you killed him.  not me. you did it because you couldn't stand the thought of johnnie fucking you.
shut up!
i'm sorry, corky ...
don't be sorry.  help me.
i'm going to ask you where the money is.  every time you don't give me an answer, i'm going to cut off one finger.
no.
when i reach ten, then i'll start with you.
you can't kill me yet.
why?
i could be lying.
no, cease.  there was no answer.
i thought i heard someone knocking.
i was buzzing, i was knocking, but i guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.
yeah, it was violet's idea.  i was so wound up about gino, she was trying to help me relax.
that violet is one nice lady.  wish someone would help me relax.
shit, mick, come on in, let me get you a drink.  sit down, lou.
we was worried about you, cease.
me?  why?
we went over to johnnie's place just to check it out and it was busted up, bad.
i started thinking maybe it's about the money so i call you, but all i get is the busy signal.  i figure the phone is off the hook, that's why i come rushing over here.
oh christ, the phone ...  that was a fucking stupid thing to do, wasn't it?
hey, if violet was helping me relax, i'd probably do the same thing.
cease, can i ask you something?
yeah.
why'd you move all the furniture around?
actually, yeah, she was nervous about gino coming, wanted everything to look right.  you know women, mick.
sure, cease.  they make us do stupid things, don't they.
is that the money?
yeah, that's it.
hey, caesar, where's the key?
the key, yeah, the key's in my pants in the bathroom.
fuck it, i don't need the key.
what?
you're blowing your only chance. act like i'm gino.
holy shit, i don't believe it!  we've been going crazy over here, gino!
good boy.
it's gino!  it's gino!
where in the hell is he?
we were in a car accident --
they were in a car accident.
but everybody is all right.
they're all fine.  just bruises and shit.
now you listen to me, asshole, i know your gun is behind the bar ...
un-fucking-believable.  i called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
ssh!  i can't hear gino!
we make a deal or i come out and hand this phone to mickey.
i'm listening.
i want what's mine, half the money. we get rid of mickey, no one else dies.  no one.  say yes, i understand.
yes, i understand.
tell them i'm at st. mary's off the kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until i come out.
sure, gino, sure.
mickey?  what are you doing here?
violet, it's gino and johnnie.  they were in a car accident.
oh my god.  was anyone hurt?
i think everything is okay.
you got the key?
oh yeah.  violet!
call me as soon as you get him.
leave your phone on the hook.
now that's teamwork.
i should have let him kill you.
you know he would have done you, too.
i knew i couldn't trust you.
mickey!  oh god, mickey!
violet?
caesar, don't.
what are you going to do, v?  shoot me?  kill me in cold blood?  i don't think so.  i'll tell you why.  if you had it in you to pull that trigger, you would have done it a long time ago.  if i was you, i would have killed me the minute i brought the money home.  but you didn't and i know why, because you don't want to kill me.  do you, v?  do you? no, i know you don't.
caesar, you don't know shit.
i will never understand it, mickey. you didn't even call the police.
i told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  we want to take care of it ourselves and we will. i'll find him.  i swear i will.
i know you will.
sure you're going to be okay?  i mean, if you're having second thoughts, my offer still stands.
thanks, mickey, but i need to get out, you know?  get away from all of this.
hey.
hey.
how'd it go?
i'm here, aren't i?
you know what the difference is between us, violet?
no.
...  me neither.
