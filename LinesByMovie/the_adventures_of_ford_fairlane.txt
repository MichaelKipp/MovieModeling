so many assholes, so few bullets.
damn, ford, you are the most cynical man in the industry and that is not easy.
I am not cynical.  can i help it that life is a disease and everyone's a victim. so you are producing exclusively for grendel records now.  hope you are taking julian for a bundle.
man, ever since old jack grendel died, julian has got me into one yummy gig after the other.  not only am i producing, he is got me in some lovely-bullshit-money-money executive position.  what are you looking at...
you are that guy, the private eye.
you are a poet and did not know it.
do you really know everybody in the industry?
only on a first name basis.
that is cute.  you are funny.
that is funny, you are cute.
you heard that bobby vomit o.d.'d, right?  do you suspect foul play and stuff?
I will tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
you got to shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and i do not mean your legs.  why did not you jump on her?  what is happening to you?
i guess I am not interested in any club who will have my member as a member.  later, don...
fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of black vomit?
tell me, dr. watson, what makes you think he is not just another piece of shit overdose.
gut feeling.
I will give you a gut feeling, you little... hey... hey!  get that stick out of your mouth.  these things are killers, man.  do not you go to school, listen to smokey the bear and all that...
when you going to let me work with you?  why you always fucking with me?
why am i what?  excuse me?  i catch you saying the f-word again.  I will kill you.  that is a fucking promise.  now get the fuck out of here.
i got something serious to dis-cuss.
well what is it?  I am not kreskin.
forget it.
your tip paid off.  jazz, this is sam the sleazebag.  sam the sleazebag, this is jazz, my secretary.
assistant.  and do not call me jazz.
all your friends call you jazz.
exactly.
you wish.
cash or check, jazz?  do not do this to me.
i do it for love.
'bye ford...'  hey, let me cheer you up.  i found the in x s payment.
g'day, they say it is worth three grand...
fucking australians!  i hate that country, continent, what is it? do not we do nuclear testing there?
let's just declare war on the hellhole.  before they make crocodile dundee three.
rock stars!  I am going out of my mind.  all i get are perks.  i do not make money, i make gifts. how am i supposed to pay taxes with bathtub compact disc players and autographed drumsticks.  i want cash.  moulah.  wampum.  dead presidents.  andrew jackson. gerald ford.
you are saying you need money.
car insurance costs money. cavities cost money.  doritos cost money.  I am going to eat that damn bear... come here!
quit crying.  i think we have got a case if we can make it through the cavalcade of bimbos, here...
you are friends with the most obnoxious asshole on the airwaves. the king of the shock jocks.  i'm, I am shocked.
i love you, too, baby.  he wants to meet at six.  what time is it now?
that is for me... radio contests, really ford, how tacky...
ah -- ha... you know, you should think about dating earthmen again.
so what about this watch?
keep it.  it is your paycheck this month.
i do not believe it.  getting paid to be the asshole you always were.
fucking amazing, huh?  chevy nova, you bensonhurst shit!  still in la-la land.  look at us, two rock 'n' roll dicks.  unfortunately, only one of us is a detective.
nice getting all those phone calls from you after you hit it big, you redhook bastard.
i do not remember any arbor day cards from mr. rock 'n' roll detective.
friendship's a lot different out here.  a wrong number is a relationship.  but then this is not a social call.
how nice.
it is my daughter, man.  i know i never told you about her, but god, i love that girl.  she calls herself zuzu petals and she is been swallowed up by the gorgeous hell that is l.a. a fucking groupie partying with the pros.  you have to get my baby back, she is my pride and --
'bye, johnny...
what?
so...
i do not take cases with foundations in bullshit.  they are very hard to walk around in.
just find her, man.  she is my daughter, she is my sister, she is my mother, she is some little brat i stood in line with at taco bell last week.  do whatever you want with my words.  and my money.
i am told it is difficult to pay the phone bill with gold chains and v.c.r.s.  there is four thousand here.
zuzu petals.  sounds like a drug. a lethal one.
i hope you solve the case and i know you will, because you are the best.  ford, guys like you do not grow on trees.
nice tie, lt. anus, sir.
you think you are so hot just because you can get into any club. you think you are so hot, just because you have sex with great- looking women.  you think you are so hot just because you broke the ensenada tape piracy ring...
you gotta admit those are all pretty great reasons...
get the fuck out of here, honey... what do we got?
what are you running from?
why shucks, lt. anus, you told me to get the fuck out of here...
if you are hiding something... oh, oh, I will have so much fun.
why do you hate me?  it is got to be more than me private you, you cop.
two words.  disco express.
disco ex -- man, that group sucked like a squid, they had some shitty single they wanted me to plug, back in my publicist days...
'booty time.'
yeah, and that lead singer, jesus, that white van mccoy wanna-be with the six-inch platform shoes. he looked...
like me.
i was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
'it's booty time, it is booty time, across the u.s.a.  it is booty time...'
you were the lead sing -- lieutenant, i did not think anyone could cheer me up tonight... thanks.  really.
ouch.
hey, you, get off my cloud.  I am talking to my friend.  1962 fender stratocaster with original humbucking pick-ups, maple neck, strung upside down for a left- handed motherfucking genius... jimi hendrix.
who cares?  i got a case.
twelve pack?
this am not no social call.  one hundred bucks.  to find my father.
did he just say what i think he said?
I have got a clue.  look at my ring. before my old lady ran off to baja, she told me my dad had this same ring.
holy colonel mustard.  gosh, you did not mention the big clue... kid, i can not take your money.
you need it.
i do not need it that bad.
ford fairlane, I am colleen sutton and i need your help.  i have a problem and it pertains to the music industry.  what is it they call you?  mr. rock and...
do not say it.  orange juice?
please.
sorry about the glass.  and the house.  and the breath.
mr. fairlane, I am very rich.  the kind of rich that warps minds. nothing offends me.  when i was eleven, i walked in on my father and the shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. does that excite you?
i do not know, i never met your father.
oh, that!  do not take it personally. he always wakes up before i do. down boy!  roseanne barr naked!
who is your decorator?
some fag.  charged me up the ass.
fag?  ass?  I am sorry, is that a joke?
poor taste.  i know.  listen, i respect homosexuals.  when i was young, my maid was a homosexual.  my maid was a homosexual.
i do not have a sense of humor, either.  sorry.
now that we have broken the ice...
i need you to find my little sister. she goes by the name zuzu...
zuzu petals.  you want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is l.a.
but how did you know?  here, take this picture...
no thanks.  i carry my own.
excuse me?
let's see, you are her worried sister.  yesterday i met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. in fact, i capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. they talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten-foot pole.
five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
yeah, but of course for now, i only get a twenty.
actually, you may take it all now.
oh... i have some questions.
i have no answers.  thanks for the stain.  find the girl.  in the envelope are tickets to the dorothy chandler.  we will chat again, then.
ah, the dorothy chandler.  i was just there with my good friend art mooney the other night...
who?
nuthin'.
quiet.  tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about art mooney...
i found a lot of art mooneys. none with a police record, though. not even synchronicity.  have you checked out johnny pinzolo/crunch's houseboat yet?
tonight after i see don. some beverly hillbilly just hired me to find you-know-fucking-who. name's colleen sutton.
spooky.  I will process her.
cool.  jazz, meet me at the dorothy chandler pavilion tonight. I will have a ticket for you at the door.  some concert.  could be interesting.  dress nice.
i have not seen her around, and as for who would want to kill johnny crunch, line forms to the left. you would find less people on our planet who wanted him alive.
great pipes.
I have heard cars fuck with more harmony.
tell me about it. name's kyle troy.  can not we bring up the bass.
how could grendel records sign such a wick-prick?  i guess julian grendel really is deaf as a fucking doorknob.  i hear ray charles is going to head up the video division.
actually that is rather an intriguing idea...
good to meet you, mr. fairlane. your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I am julian grendel.
boing.  you are one hell of a lip reader.
why thank you.  it is a christmas present.  that was my sense of humor, everyone.  i wish you would fake a laugh.  it is easy with a deaf person.
i knew your father.  he was quite...
an asshole?  a swine?  a ballistic turd?  pick one.  i never knew what a blessing my accident was until he died and i had to take over the company.  you see the music is irrelevant in this industry.  I am going to have to ship this 'wick-prick' platinum just so teenage girls can have a compact disc cover to get wet with.
julian's happy as long as he does not see glass shatter.
i never thought I would be jealous of your handicap... sorry to hear about bobby vomit.
terrible thing, but good career move.  his record sales have gone way up.  I will just have to create a new black vomit.
i was just discussing this whole vomit thing with my friend art mooney.  do you know him?
but i am not got you...
but i am not got you...
no, i am not got you...
no, i am not got you...
i said, i am not got you...
i said, i am not got you...
i am not -- got -- you.
have a copy of that sent to me, will ya?
right away!
polo.
whatever you are getting paid, i can give you twenty, maybe thirty bucks more.
feel my thumb?  i keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  i leave.  twenty- one minutes later, you are dead. the slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
i guess you never saw 'a very brady christmas.'
case closed, okay?  thirty seconds.
fine!
what is fine?
I am off it!
off what?  twenty seconds...
the case!
oh.  one more thing.  this is personal.  i want you to tell me you are a big sissy.
i.  am.  the.  biggest.  sissy. in.  the.  whole.  fucking.  world.
my god, mr. fairlane, you look like the fall of saigon.
colleen and johnny, sitting in a tree, k-i-s-s-i-n-g...
uh, let's go sit down.
sorry, jazz.  after this, I will throw a burger down your throat, okay?
you are a fucking gentleman.  what do you want from me?
this colleen sutton woman I am with. if she flees me to go powder her whatever, i need you to keep tabs...
you going to be okay?
go on, 'they're stahting.'
so you know about johnny crunch and myself.
I am sorry, that is got to be a pair of tube socks he has down there.
ouch... of course i want off the case.  some monster from woodstock tried and succeeded in killing me tonight.  the fact I am alive's a technicality.
so you...
listen, queen collie, i have a code. i never, ever, drop a case.  besides, i, uh, used all your money to pay my bills, so i kinda owe you.
nonsense.  after what you have been through, it sounds like i owe you.
they did one of these about my ex- wife.  it is called 'the nutcracker.'  'the nut-crack-er'... i do not need money.  i need some questions answered.
I will do my best.
question one:  can i have some money?  kidding.  why did not you tell me about you and johnny?  you two were into something even more dangerous than sex, were not you? who?  what?  where?  how?  now.
jonathan was such a beautiful man. no one knew him like i did... excuse me.  i can not do this now. I will call you tomorrow.
thanks for the information. appreciate it.
well, hello, ford.
mmmmmmm.  mmmm, mmm.
i must say you are an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhea.
and it is good to see you, julian. this is my assistant, jazz.
mmmmmmm.  mmmm, mmm.
so what did you think of the ballet? was it like a warm ice capades?
yeah, i did, you condescending fuck, but i miss snoopy coming out at the end.  is not your enjoyment impaired?
do not worry i can run every ballet note for note in my brain...
jazz, we are talking here.
go on, another time, another place.
why did you interrupt?  maxwell seemed like he wanted to hire me.
shut up, goodies from the ice queen.
how did you get this from her?
you do not want to know, believe me. but do not worry, i washed my hands...
a fucking c.d.  wow, this case is closed.  so, she is got bad taste in music and in men... did i tell you she and johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
no, as a matter of fact you didn't. what about the girl, zuzu petals, how does she fit in?  i mean, she is what this case is about.
i wish i knew.  you did good work...
make eye contact when you say that.
I am sorry, that dress.  what do you say we...
celebrate?  like we celebrated after solving the white bluesman murders?  forget it, man.
got those vomit invites here...
scalping to a funeral, you are a pretty sleazy guy.
thanks.  you interested.  it is festival seating, so...
how much?
three hundred.
you gave it to the girls for one.
hey, they blew me.
oh.  three hundred coming right up.
zuzu petals!  zuzu petals!  yes! who killed bobby vomit?  who killed johnny crunch?  why do people want you so goddamn bad?
i do not know.  I am so scared. help me.
a simple 'please' would suffice...
fluck you!
you were saying, snapperhead?  I will bet you are not smiling now!
oh, but i am.  dianetics, ford.  you should try it.
say cheese...
it is red, ford.
what?
hello?
give me your gum and grab the wheel.
you okay?
peachy.
let's get serious...
why are all these people after me?
uh... wha?  you are supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  i take it a woman named colleen sutton is not your big sister and that the late d.j. johnny crunch am not your daddy?
I am so sure!  I am an only child and my parents are bill and shirley petals of south bend, indiana. they run a hardware store and...
you hung out with bobby vomit. who would want him dead?
i dunno.  he was to sound what cezanne was to image or at least i thought so.  ever since he died, I have been chased... omigod!
what?  jesus, tell me!
it is spunk lewis, the lead singer for dead ribbit!  mr. bus driver, stop!
spunk, come back...
how is it you can look at that hairhead and see god, when all i see is a lucky asshole from reseda.
because i know rock-n-roll.
you know rock-n-roll?  darlin', I have been in the music industry for as long as you have lived.  I have seen things you can not even have nightmares about... but then i guess I am just not equipped to know the industry the way you do...
come again?  b.fl.d., i have sex with rock stars; it is not like I am doing something that i do not enjoy with them, like shuffleboard. do not worry about me, i practice safe sex and next summer, I am going to u.c.l.a.
zuzu petals, you are not bad.  in fact, i was discussing this whole rock-n-roll thing with my pal art mooney the other day.  you know him?
no.  who is art mooney?
he is the lamest clue I have ever had in my life.  here's our stop...
what did you... hey, where is your spex?
contacts.
i like.
i do not know, what was the case?
ms. sutton hired you to find the girl.  period.
then i guess her case is closed. mine isn't.  i want to know why everybody wants zuzu.  why people are killing and dying for her.
yeah, it is weird.  bobby and johnny were such good friends...
friends?  you did not tell me that.
you did not ask.  have you ever thought about mousse?
she is just a bundle of energy, a real treasure...
yeah, let's bury her.
hello...  it is colleen.  with answers.  she wants to meet.  down.  way down-town.  late.
i ask you to find a girl and instead you steal a c.d. from me. ford.  you suck.
I will buy you a new one.  i found her.
zuzu petals!  did she have it?
have what?
did she tell you anything?
lots of things.  her favorite yogurt.  the ten drummers she would take to a desert island...
drink your cappucino, you are giving me a headache...
damnit... you were right last night. jonathan and i were into more than sex.  along with bobby vomit, right after old jack grendel died, we took part in a scheme to rip off grendel records... i did not want you involved...
but i am...
what cheap shit... hey, waiter!
we invested in these factories. in vancouver.
hold that thought.  are we being shot at?
that was close...
what did these vancouver factories do?
art mo-o-o-ney!
thanks, i needed that.
have a problem, call ford fairlane.  he will not solve your case, but who cares, you will be dead in a couple days anyway. let's face it.  after today, the california raisins are not going to hire you.
that is okay.  I am quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer.  pay's the same, but it will be much more fun.
god, i wish i could prove you killed everybody.  unfortunately, i know who the real killer is.
really?
it is some psycho killer groupie. i got an anonymous letter that says she killed bobby vomit, johnny crunch, and now, this society dame.
once i got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. i did not even buy a fucking umbrella... you were in too many discos during the seventies.  the village people rotted your brain.
that is the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of spam like you.  you look at this picture and all you see is beauty.  i see the beast.
you okay?
lieutenant anus has discovered the cold-blooded killer behind everything.
who?
ah, an obvious choice.
let's get her out of here, before she starts a shoot-out.  drop us at my place.
why are you depressed?  you get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
stop.  we still got serious detective stuff to do, but we have been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
what a perv...
let's watch some 'm.t.v.'
people still watch that?
who cares about people?
zuzu, wake up...
hah fluck, great video, huh?
are you okay?
okay?  i just blew up.  i feel orgasmic.
my axe!
ford, do you got something cooking in the microwave?
I am sorry...
shut up, you dummy.  who did this to you?
these two guys in long cowboy coats and real nice suits.  i think armani.  they were going through your stuff with screwdrivers and shit... i did what you would have done.
run to the nearest phone and call the police.
fuck that, i mean, the heck with that.  i kicked their ass!  well, i tried.  there were two of them you know...
jesus, how could you be so stupid?  come on, we are going to a hospital.
i tried to help you...!
and hey, i appreciate it...
where is my father?  have you even looked?
yeah, uh, i got some pretty good leads...
liar!  you do not care!  about anything.
hi, private eye guy!
hey, the poet...
hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective i told you about.
hebedeebuh.  hebedeebuh.  maybe i did die in the explosion.
i know the feeling.  this must be hell.  can you believe, a flucking sorority... I am going to vomit day-glo.
ye-ah.  sure.
hello, ford...
what are you doing at the office? you would not believe what I have gone through tonight... I am calling from the mega beta pogo sorority.
i came to warn you...
oh, jazz, those bastards... call an ambulance!  get that music off!
this is not music!
it is to us!  it is computerised.
i believe the last time we came across one of these, was at the ballet.  what were your words...  'a fucking c.d.  this case is closed.'
I have always said the one reason I am the best detective in the industry is that I am the only one... but hey, i never throw away a clue...
aha, just what i suspected!
you are not funny.
this is boring, guys.
zuzu, be quiet.  put in colleen's disc.  number two.
hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  this one is putting out low bits.  the data is in some fucked binary system.  the two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  comprendo?
su-ure.  two people hired me to find zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  but it is not necessary.  people are dead.  one was a friend.  the same people were involved in a scam to rip off grendel records. bottom line's julian grendel is doing a little revenge number...
uh, nice piano.  probably get a lot of complaints from the neighbors -- heh...  it is another time, julian, another place.  if i told you bobby vomit, johnny crunch, and colleen sutton were the ones you were complaining about, the ones who tried to rip you off, what would your reaction be?
shock.
and if i told you that you already knew all that shit, and that you had them killed, what would you do then?
golly, I would probably faint.
ford, you were right!
ye-ah.
actually you are a bit off in the motivation department... i mean, revenge is so... bronson.  wait, where is the third c.d.?  how could you come here without proof? it is a three piece set here!  a computer disc from colleen, bobby's computer disc, and johnny's computer disc.  together they make, oh fucking forget it!
yeah, yeah, i know the third one unscrambles the high bits and the low bits.  shit, just start torturing me, man.  i did not even know johnny had a disc and i can not deal with any 'don't play games with me, mr. fairlane' bullshit.
do not play games... ugh.  did you say you do not have the third... ugh.  I am not going to torture you, ford.
it does not have to be like this?
oh god, please, don't!
okay!  okay.  you got me.  boy, you guys are tough.  i have the third disc.  indeed.  i.  do. yes, sir.  yeah you assholes, it is in a very safe place with instructions to have it sent directly to the police if i do not make a phone call by seven o'clock.  so if you will excuse us...
it is 7:30.  you really should get a watch.
ah, i did not say seven p.m., now did i?
i just gave up smoking.  a last drink?
I am running a little late.  you see, I am having a party at the club to introduce the new lead singer for black vomit.  everyone in the industry will be there, including our friend, don cleveland.
what about don?
before black vomit starts its set, don will have his head blown off. the papers next week will reveal that he was partners with bobby, johnny, and collie in 'the grendel records scam.'  he killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  and then the mob iced him.  it is all more tasteful than it sounds.
I am afraid so, you want her?
but you know, that was just a dream.  does not really count.
kill them.  not quickly.
are you okay?
when i say 'no,' run for the door.
oh, wait.  one sec.  open the window.
shit.
ciao.
nice left you got there, jerk.
sorry, it was dark, now come on.
this way...
no, wait...
suck a dick, i left my purse...
as clark gable said to ava gardner in mogambo:  'fuck the purse, we are going to die-e-e.'
reality-reality-reality -- outrageous building, huh?
ye-ah.
pretty smooth, huh?
smooth.  i know this is dangerous and everything but it is kind of fun. ever see "batman," you know when batman and robin are climbing up the side of the building and somebody sticks their head outside the window and says... i forget what they said but it is pretty funny.
why have you come to my planet?
ick.
i will not ask why you would want to help someone trying to kill you, but hey, good job.  shall we?
i want you to say that you are the biggest sissy in the whole wide world.
i'm.  the.  biggest.  sissy.  in. the.  wide.  world.
okay.  'b-y-e!
hey.  god.  you are an asshole.
let go of the belt!  what are you doing?  you got mad at me for trying to save the other guy.
i can not kill this kid's father...
who do you think you are, ford? the tooth fairy.  kill!  kill!  kill!
this is fucking unbelievable.  zuzu, it is a long story, you see...
hello, mr. tongue!  what a perv.
you wish.  come on, let's get outta here.
are you okay?
there is that question...
your timing swallows the massive one. grendel just tried to kill us, he is about to frame and kiss don, and we can not do shit.  do not even ask about those discs. goddamn that art mooney with a star by his name!  it is tied to johnny's c.d., i know.
johnny's c.d.?
oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
artartartartmooneymooneymooney mooney.
what an interface!
seems to be information about a factory in vancouver.
yeah, colleen mentioned it.  what do they make?
c.d.s.  the music kind.  from the grendel label.
without grendel knowing about it. b-i-n-g-o and bingo was his name-o. counterfeit c.d.s.  tape piracy has graduated to disc piracy, the sound quality's better, and so's the money.
but the funny thing is, take a look at these swiss bank account numbers. we got bobby, johnny, colleen... and julian grendel.
after their initial investment in the factory, grendel did not need them.  told them to fuck off. they tried to get these c.d.s together in order to have proof of grendel's involvement, so they could keep him in line.  now's the fun part...
i can not believe i lost an eye for a bunch of phony c.d.s
hey, don, how is the high blood pressure.
could somebody tell me what is going on?  like slo-owly...
you-see-it-all-starts-with-this- factory-in-vancouver-and there is these-c.d.s...
I will mail you a letter, come on!
you would said something about proof...
oh please, ford, I will do any --
and may i suggest for dessert, the five copies i made...
fuck me...
maybe later, but first i want like to know why you would steal from your own company...
when i was young, i read billboard and i could not believe how much grendel records and how little of it my idiot father old jack grendel got.
yeah, it is pretty amazing how much cash you got to give to the actual artists who create the music.  those ingrates really take a bite.  but seriously, when pops died, you got vomit, crunch, and sutton to help finance a c.d. cleans operation. you got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
what is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
man, julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
accident?  accident!  you naive pussball, when i realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  i cut my fucking ears off so I would only hear my music. here, look.
hoh graphic!  I am going to dream of ears for a year!  ugh!
just be thankful he was not dissatisfied with his sex life.
I am still the king!
julian, you are fired.
thanks for the promotion, man.
no prob...
so, zuzu.  are you okay?
yeah, ford.  I am okay.
how is it going?
you got to be kidding!  this is unfuckingbelievable!  i have to start the evening crawling down capital records, i shoulda chose suicide then, but oh no, the night was young!  next up, my guitar! the second most important thing i own and now it is toothpicks for the homeless on hollywood boulevard!  then, then, after i burned up your brother, jazz... i should say as a fucking footnote I have usually treated women like shit -- used corsages, the wet spot, you know giving out domino's pizza's phone number and saying it is mine... tonight was different. i felt respect.  i felt love.  then jazz left me... and now i get to die!
the point?
let me go out like a man.
