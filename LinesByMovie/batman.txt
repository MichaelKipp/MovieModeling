let's beat it, man.  i do not like it up here.
what are you, scared of heights?
i dunno, man.  after what happened to johnny gobs - -
look, johnny gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  no big loss.
that am not what i heard.  that am not what i heard at all.  i heard the bat got him.
gimme a break, will you?  shut up.
five stories, straight down. there was no blood in the body.
no shit.  it was all over the pavement.
there was no blood, man.  my brother says... all the bad things you done... they come back and haunt you...
god!  how old are you?  there am not no bat.
my brother's a priest, man.
no wonder you are such a chickenshit.  now shut up.  there am not no bat.
you shouldn'ta turned the gun on that kid, man.  you shouldn'ta --
do you want this money or do not you?  now shut up!  shut up --
i missed you, lieutenant.
sorry.  we had another bat sighting.
do not let your job interfere with your business.  -- someone is been talking to harvey dent.
I am on top of it.  if there is a problem --
eckhardt... our problems are your problems.
i answer to grissom, punk.  not to you.
why, eckhardt.  you should be thinking about the future.
got it all figured, huh?  grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- maybe he do not know what we know.
what are you talking about?
about how pretty you are, pretty boy.  maybe he would like to know --
how did you know it was me?
honey - - i would know any randomly selected square inch of vicki vale.  if i had a good enough hint.
burned out.  i need a vacation.
too much glamor, huh.  what is in the bag - - monte carlo?  apes in kenya?
god, vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
a girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  what is new and hot in gotham city?
oh, it is too good.  we got a six-foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers.
evildoers, huh?  big or small?
small so far.  i think he is leaving the big fish for harvey dent.
our next d.a. -- i hear bruce wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  did you get your invitation yet?
oh, absolutely.  bruce and i are very close.
no.
well, I am starving.  will you at least buy me a hamburger?
okay, a break-in.  trash the office, make off with the books ... "industrial espionage."
very good idea, jack.  in fact --  -- I would like you to handle this operation personally.
why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
because i want someone i can trust.
i understand.
oh, jack.  -- do not forget your lucky deck.
how high up would you say that is?
I would say about thirty feet, sir.
you know, if you cut your bathroom in half, you would have my apartment.
which bathroom is that, sir?
the small one.
man, i feel like robin leach.  you actually know all these people?
some.  i am a rich bitch, remember?  I am quoting.
where does one man get all this junk?
all aver the world.  they say he is spent half of his life overseas.
holy shit...
rich.  reclusive.  bankrolls half a dozen charities.
likes to kill? knox  women find him magnetic.
i bet they like him for his big charity balls.
that, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
well, you know me.  the more they have got, the less they are worth.  this guy must be the most worthless man in america.
i assume in my usual charming manner I have just insulted the host.  alexander knox.
bruce wayne.  -- I have read your work.  i quite like it.
great.  give me a grant.
i might consider it if you introduce me to miss vale.
"this is miss vale." -- that felt redundant.
you are just back from corto maltese.  i saw your combat photos.  quite a departure for you.
i don't... seek publicity -- will you be staying in gotham for a while?
as far as i know.
good.  with any luck we will run into each other.
excuse me, sir.  commissioner gordon was compelled to leave - -very unexpectedly.  he asked me to convey his regrets.
thank you, alfred.  i hope you will excuse me.  it was a great pleasure meeting you.  and you.
oh.  sorry.  i was thinking.
what were you thinking?
yum, yum.
well, he must like the way he looks.  he is got a mirror in every room.
guess who is got a date with bruce wayne?
bruce wayne?  date?  he called you up and asked you for a date?  shit.  hey, miranda!  c'mere!  now pay close attention to this.  miranda -- tell my friend here what you told me about bruce wayne.
peanuts?
yeah.  peanuts.  which is how he goes through women.
plain or roasted?  alex, I am very flattered that you have gone out and done all this research.
why?  aw, come on, vicki, I am a reporter. I am curious.  i do this for a living.  there is a phone.  you can call him up and cancel.
do you sail?
too much work.  I am not really the physical type -- thank you, alfred.
two drinks and i start swinging from the rooftops.  look, i bore myself silly.  let's talk about you. how the hell did you wind up in corto maltese?
that is a tough one.  have you ever seen combat?
no.
neither had i.  odd desire for a woman, i guess.
odd desire for anyone.
well.  a couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid i went down there for newsweek. the beaches were nice.  and at nights -- they had a band -- i danced on the hotel patio.  of course i never saw what was really happening there. when the war broke out i had to go back. and i promised myself that this time... i would not look away.
what did you see?
... terror.
there is terror everywhere.  if you train yourself to look for it.
well, bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
bruce, really, when i say these things i do not mean to criticize you.
in other words, what right do i have to talk about terror.
as much as i do.  it is not that.  i do not want to be depressing, that is all.
i see.  if i know how you really feel, i will not like you as much.
I am sorry, bruce, i just can not seem to get a handle on this conversation.
vicki, if i say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, i think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  because even if it does not sound that way... that is how I will mean it.
but it is not fair.  I am half drunk and you are not even --
I will take you home if you would like.
god.  you would.  come on, bruce.  i just want to get two drinks in you.  as an experiment.
maybe we should just kiss.
... we could try that.
it is me.  "sugar bumps."
jack?  thank god.  i can not believe it is you.  i heard you would been --
is that what you "heard"?
it is not the girl, jack.  sooner or later you would have tried to take me.  you may get me now, but your life will not be worth a dime.
I have died once already.  it was not so bad -- in fact i recommend it.
jack, listen -- we will cut a deal --
jack?  jack?  do i look like a jack?
jack - - please - - wipe that lunatic grin off your face.
ha!  that is the best part. i can't!!
i do not sing very well.
then there is one thing in the world you do not do very well. and i know what it is -- now you will have to kill me.
i do not like taking orders from grissom. and i especially do not like taking orders from grissom's goon.
I have considered that possibility.
and what happens if we say no?
nobody wants a war, carmine.  if we can not do business, we shake hands and part friends.
that is it?
that is it.
to tell you the truth, I would just about given up waiting.
i said I would call you the minute i got free.  and i did -- and here we are.
mm-hmm.  lunch.  not even dinner.
all street mimes should be executed.
... looks like a convention.
nice snap, huh?  pulitzer prize, 1963.
his face.  allie, look at his face.
yep.  he watched the whole thing happen - - recognize the beat cop?  jim gordon
oh, bruce...
something like this -- what do you suppose this could drive a guy to?
you are on drugs.
yeah?  according to this, he is in geneva from '76 to '79. well, i called geneva.  nobody there is even heard of the guy - - probably off in tibet with some kung fu master.
are they paying you for all this?
everybody needs a hobby.  you explain it, vicki.  he walks out on his own party.  half an hour later, who turns up?  batman.  sees an execution, freaks out in an alleyway.  no place to change.
allie, i know exactly why you are doing this.
... oh?  why is that, vicki?
he is best friends with jim gordon and harvey dent.  they would know.
... okay, then, i have a confession to make.  I am the batman.
alexander... i know you.
right.  and they know him.  and that is why it would never occur to them for a minute that their old buddy bruce puts on a cape at night and goes out looking for --
I have had it with you.  I am leaving.
bruce wayne is out of his mind.  next time you call him up and he can not go out friday night - - think it over.
... thank you.
unfortunate, but i think we can work around it.
and you want a --
a visual record, yes.  a before-and- after kind of thing.  this could make your reputation.
maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist.  people might like to see the face behind the makeup.
... behind the makeup?
I have seen worse.  much worse.
strong stomach, huh?  i like that in a woman -- maybe we can do business after all.
... why the mask?
alicia!  come here, have a seat.  show miss vale why you wear the mask.
you scum!  you sick filth!... you did that to her!
what?  i improved her a little...
I will see you burn.  I will see you dead -- get away from me!!
miss vale, was it something i said?  do you want to sniff my flower?
get in the car!!
which car?
look! police!
i know. i called them.
should not we --
what about the girl?
he will not kill her. -- goddammit!
can not we --
too many people. come on!  shields!!
we got 'em!
take 'em! i want his head!
how much do you weigh?
... a hundred and eight?
...not even a 'thank you'?
well -- i think you might consider
I will have to ask you for that film.
i just wanted to distract them. i was not trying to get a picture of you.
please.
i will not let you have it.
the joker is a murderer. and you were as good as dead. so --
look, i appreciate what you did for me. but this is my job. and I am keeping those pictures.
all right, I will develop the photos. anything i do not want is yours.
how do i know you will not keep them all?
I will take you with me.
thank you, vicki.
... where are you taking me?
... how long have i been out?
quite a while. i took the scenic route.
well, I have certainly enjoyed it. -- what is that?
what is this stuff? kevlar?
better. it is not on the market yet.
it does not protect your head, though.
that is why i wear a target on my chest.
how did you find this place?
exploring. in the woods. many years ago. -- i was a solitary child.
they do not come down here. they are afraid of the lights.
i loathe bats.
so did i, once. but i kept coming back, and... i guess i became the thing i feared most.
what is that?
photo database. I will do your photos now.
they have got it all wrong. they are watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. the joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
that can not be right. that would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. we would all be dead.
no. every product contains one component. the elements react in combination. hair spray will not do it. but hair spray and perfume and lipstick will.  untraceable. it is very elegant.
i just can not absorb it all. this place, the equipment. what it must have cost.  why all the secrecy? why do you wear the mask?
i do not want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
if you do not mind my asking... who is close to you?
is this what you wanted?
you could have killed him, you know. you could have killed the joker.
i had to save you, vicki. i --  -- please trust me.
i know it is late. i -- are you there?
yes, bruce -- I am here --
I am sorry i had to stand you up today. I would like to make it up to you.
well, bruce -- i do not think -- that would be possible.
i realize... the way things have gone between us...  ... i wish you would reconsider.
i wish you'd...
the guy's bats all right. he is bat shit crazy. he --  -- i can not believe it. i was right!!
allie, he is not.
not what?
he is not crazy.
vicki. we got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. he goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  crazy bat-stard!
allie... he wants to tell me. i had a roll of film. his face was on it. he knew that -- and he let me keep.
jesus, vicki! where is it??
it is gone.
vicki?... this is batman. i thought I would call and see how you are doing.
... i know it is you, bruce. I am not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
who is this 'bruce'? are you trying to make me jealous?
I am serious, bruce. we have to -- !
joker here. can we talk?
I would like to read a prepared statement. 'while this administration remains vehemently opposed to terrorism in any form, we are prepared to negotiate any reasonable demands which will guarantee the safety of the populace.'
huh. demands. well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I am having such a swell time, i just have not thought any up.
all right, then. here's the deal. total amnesty... and the sum of ten million dollars, payable in --
ten million dollars. ten mi -- you cheapskates! I have just wiped out the stock market. I have cost you billions!  i want ten million and one.
please! we will talk. just tell us what you expect.
goddammit, i expect to be treated like and artist. get off my screen!!
yes?
alexander knox. gotham globe.
mr. wayne is out for the day.
actually, i wanted to talk to batman. pass that on to mr. wayne, would you?
that is how it is, chum. one column - and i can bring all this tumbling down. i can take you off the streets for good.
what is it you want?
i want you to hang up the suit. and i want you to stay away from vicki.
i can not do that. not while the joker's still at large.
then stay away from vicki. that is all i want, man. i just want your word.
see, i do not know how it happened... she is a smart girl and you are an extraordinary screwed-up guy... but she is in love with you.
tell me, knox. if you have got the story, why have not you printed it?
because i...  ... because she would never speak to me again.
do you want a drink?
yeah, a drink. 'civilized,' right?
alfred, bring something for mr. knox -- I will have one, too.
so we just pretend none of this ever happened. we never met. we --  -- you are going to get yourself killed, bruce. you know that, do not you?
no one would miss me.
i do not understand it. you can do so much good for people. as bruce wayne.
money makes money, vicki. the foundation runs itself -- I am extraneous to the process.
you are one man. you can not save everybody.
what if i could save a handful? -- what if i could save one?
bruce, at the rate you are going, you can not even save yourself.
sometimes... i do not know if there is enough of me left to save.
it is like the last time. he sent me a present before he --
very thoughtful. do not touch it.
oh, bruce. do not tell me you carry it around with you.
i feel naked without it.
"it worked for van gogh. let's kiss and make up."
the does it. it is going to be this weekend.
keep her on the line!
... where are you calling from?
I am sorry, she hung up. what are --
finding out where she is.
how can you do that if she is already off the line?
I have had an automatic tracer on this number ever since he tracked you to the museum.
got it!
what now?
hang on. i have to leave a message.
somebody is killed the power!!
what?
somebody is killed the --
what??
boss! jesus! they have --
they will be sorry. they will be sorry. move out!
move! can not you do something??
it is a detour. they are backed up for blocks!
like your boyfriend. he is kinda hot.
take me. let the boy go.
gosh, i could kill you, but then you would miss my party. and you, batman -- you are the guest of honor!
what are you talking about?
batman! do not you even recognize your old pal jack? after all...  ... you made me what i am today.
we will raid the ace the moment we get a warrant.
he will be ready when you do. remember what happened at the apartment.
all right, bruce, what do you suggest?
i suggest a nice big bomb.
good. a bomb. on a blind tip from bruce wayne -- we do have laws.
then for god's sake, harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration.
we have told him we will deal. what could he possible have to gain by --
do you still think the joker cares about money??
i do not know. I am just a d.a. i do not have access to all you expert sources.
it is all right, alfred. everything's under control.
... very good, sir.
all this apparatus, vicki... this house, and the money, and the power ... it was never mine. it was something i inherited. bruce wayne was something i inherited.  all i ever hoped for was someone who could see through bruce -- who could see me -- and not be frightened.
I am frightened of you, bruce. I am frightened for you.
in all these years... why could not i see how it wold turn out?
where is the boy?
upstairs. he is quite docile.
i know the feeling. it will not last.  he is a long way ahead of where i was at his age.
respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
how long's it been, alfred? a quarter of a century?  it seems like yesterday. i guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
do not ever say that, sir. do not ever believe it.
if not for you i never would have made it. you know that. my own parents could not have...  ... the boy, alfred. you will both be provided for. do not let all this got to waste.
could not turn down the job, huh? a girl could get hurt this way.
yeah. deja vu.
what do you say? let's head for the lights.
look! it is bruce!!  allies -- the balloons. we have got to find some way to tell him!
great. how??
holy shit!!
you okay?
yeah. yeah. little winded. did you see that?!
god yes, allie. I have got to say -- that was the ballsiest move i ever...
holy shit. holy...
you know, we should have sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. i bet we would have got on famously.
... murderer...
bruce, we are both murderers. think how many people you have killed by letting me live.
i do not know why I am doing this. i half wish you would stay a cripple.
ohhhh... you do not mean that.
i don't, but... i do. it is just... i love you, bruce. i do not want you to...
vicki. do you love half of me? or all of me?
