loud and clear, kid.  what's up?
i've finished my circle and i haven't picked up any life read- ings.
there isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a space cruiser. my sentry markers are placed. i'm heading back to the base.
i'll see you shortly. a meteorite just hit the ground near here and i want to check it out .. won't be long.
captain solo.  what's the situation?
there isn't a hint of life in the area.  but all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
good, and commander skywalker?
he's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. he'll be in soon.
with all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
the empire won't look for you out here.  i'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
that's right.
you're an extraordinary fighter. i hate to lose you.
thank you, general.  but there's a price on my head.  if i don't pay off jabba the hutt, i'm a walking dead man.
i understand.  a death mark is not an easy thing to live with ... until our paths cross again, may the force be with you.
yes, your highness?
you said you were going to stay. what happened?
that bounty hunter we ran into on ord mantell changed my mind.
does luke know?
he'll know when he gets back ... don't give me that look.  every day more bounty hunters are searching for me.  if i don't pay off jabba soon, there'll be too many to stop ... remotes, gank killers, and who knows what else.  i've got to get that price off my head while i still have a head.
han, we need you here.
we?
yes.
not you?
me?  i don't know what you mean.
you probably don't.  how could you?  you're so terrified of your own emotions ...
and what are they, pray tell?
you want me to stay because of the way you feel about me.
i respect you.  you're a bold fighter, maybe not the brightest, but ... han no, your worship.. that's not what i'm talking about.
am i?  i say you came running after me because you were afraid i was leaving you without even a kiss.
i'd just as soon kiss a wookiee.
there's no accounting for taste. believe me, you could use a good kiss.  you've spent so much time doing your duty and giving orders you've never learned how to be a woman. it's a shame, because you've got all the makings for one.  i could have helped you plenty in that department ... if you'd have let go for a minute.  but it's too late now, sweetheart.  your big opportunity is flying out of here.
we are fighting for a cause much ...
spare me please!  don't tell me about the rebellion again.  i've had it with your noble mission. all you let yourself think about is the rebellion.  the result is you're as cold as this planet.
and you think you're the one to apply some heat?
sure ... if i were interested. but i don't think it'd be much fun.
captain solo, sir. might i have a word with you?
what is it?
mistress leia has been trying to reach you on the communicator, but either you have it turned off, or it is malfunctioning ... if it's damaged, artoo, could fix it, if you like.
i shut it off.  what's her royal holiness want?
she is looking for master luke, and assumed he would be here with you.  no one seems to know ...
yes sir!
sergeant, is commander skywalker back yet?
i haven't seen him.  he probably came in through the south entrance.
probably isn't good enough, sergeant. check on it!
i don't know, artoo.  sir, might i inquire what's going on?
go tell your precious princess ... luke is dead unless he shows up soon.
commander skywalker hasn't come through the south entrance, sir. maybe he slipped by without checking in.
not likely!  where are the speeders?
we haven't got them adapted to this cold yet ...
we'll have to go out on tauntauns.
the temperature is dropping too fast.
you bet it is ... and luke's out in it.
the night storms will start before you can reach the first marker.
then i'll see you in hell.
i can't ...
you must.  luke, look at me!
you must survive, luke.
i'm cold ... so cold ...
you must go to the dagobah system ... there you will learn from one who taught me:  yoda, the jedi master.
ben ... ben ...
luke ... you are the only hope.
nothing more can be done tonight. the shield doors must be closed. i can't wait any longer.  i'm sorry.
i understand.
the speeders should be ready in the morning.  they'll make the search easier.
is there any chance of them surviving out there?
slim, but yes, there's a chance. they have a shelter.  it's not much, but ...
he doesn't make sense to me either, chewie.
i do hope he's all there ... if you take my meaning.  i would hate to see master luke develop a short circuit ...
the kid ran into something mean, and it wasn't the cold.
those creatures he keeps talking about ... we'd better double the security ... han, i don't know how ...
forget it.
now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
no kidding.  if this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
have they analyzed the one that was killed?
not yet.  they're working on it now.
we've picked up something outside the base in zone one, moving east.
what is it?
whatever it is, it isn't friendly. i'm going to have a look.  come on, chewie.
wait.  i'll send a patrol with you.
fine.  but they'll have to take care of themselves.
.... i'm afraid there's not much left.
what was it?
droid of some kind.  i didn't hit it that hard.  it must have had a self-destruct ....
an imperial probe droid.
now don't panic.  we don't know that.
the hoth system?
yes, sir .... we have visuals ... the system is supposed to be devoid of human forms ...
the bacta are growing well.  the scars should be gone in a day or so.  does it still hurt?
i'm fine.  really.  leia ... when i was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
me too.  i was afraid.
you rest now.
so much has happened during the period of your indisposition, sir.
i'll be back later.
leia ... what would you think if i went away for a while?
what did you say?!
where are you going?
i have this ... feeling.  i'm not sure, really ...
that's just great.  why doesn't everyone just take off?
what are you talking about?
first han, now you.  when am i going to learn not to count on anyone but myself? ...
han's leaving?
calm down, will ya?  tell me about han.
he wants to pay off that criminal he's in hock to.
jabba the hutt?
i could get more loyalty if i went down the hall and recruited some of those snow creatures.
snow creatures ... they're here?!
hi kid, you look strong enough to wrestle a gundark.
thanks to you.
that's two you owe me, junior.
well, your worship, it looks like you arranged to keep me close by for a while longer.
i had nothing to do with it.  general rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we know where that probe came from.
probe?  what probe?
that makes a good story.  but i think you just can't bear to let me out of your sight.
i don't know what he's talking about.
ooops!  i guess you haven't told luke about that yet.
about what?
now don't get the wrong idea, pal. she was just trying to express her true feelings for me.
you must have gone completely out of your feeble mind.
come on, your highness, are you telling me you haven't been thinking about that kiss?
why you low-down, stuck-up, half- witted, scruffy-looking nerf-herder.
who's scruffy-looking?  i tell ya' sweetheart, i must've hit pretty close to the mark to get you hoppin' like this.  doesn't it look that way to you, luke?
yes, my lord.
make ready to land general veers' assault troops on the surface. then deploy the fleet so that nothing can get off that system. you're in command now, admiral piett.
i hope you make your peace with jabba.
don't worry.  you haven't seen the last of us.
two transports at a time is awfully risky.
we have no choice.  send them up ... and start clearing everyone out.
hey!  someone's still in here.
wait, don't open it ... that's one of the traps for the ice creatures.
transport xj. get out of here. go!
the energy shield is down.  we'll be stuck here forever.
would it help if i got out and pushed?
don't worry, your holiness, i'll get her started.
this bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
this baby's got a few surprises left in her.
i'll be surprised if we ever start moving.
seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
anything on the millennium falcon?
it won't get through the blockade.
i want that ship.
i know, i know, i see them ... leia see what?
two more star destroyers heading right at us.
i'm glad you said there was going to be no problem, or i'd be worried.
sir, i was wondering ...
sit down, and shut up!
it can wait.
i think we're in trouble.
if i may say so, sir, i noticed earlier that the entire main para- light system seems to be damaged.
we're in trouble!
that was no laser blast .... some- thing hit us ....
or you ran into something ....
asteroids!  chewie, bank left, let's find out where they're coming from ...
probably an asteroid field ....
let's hope so ... it's just the chance we need.
to get killed ... you're not seriously going into an asteroid field?
aren't i?  hang on, sweetheart. we're gonna do some flyin'.
you don't have to do this to impress me.
if i might remind you, sir, the probability of successfully navi- gating through an asteroid field is approximately 365,000 to one ... a graceful surrender might not be ...
my lord.
come in, admiral.
our pursuit ships have sighted the millennium falcon, my lord.  it has entered an asteroid field.
asteroids don't concern me, admiral. i want that ship, not excuses.  how long until you can have skywalker and the others in the millennium falcon before me?
soon, lord vader.
yes, admiral .... soon.
well, you said you wanted to be there when i was wrong.
i take it back.
that star destroyer is slowing down.
good.
but we're going to get pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
i'm against that.
we've got to get out of this shower.
now you're making sense.
right.  i'm going to get in closer to one of these big ones ...
closer?!
closer?!
there, there.  chewie get a reading on that.  looks pretty good.
what is it?
that should do nicely.
it was .... the emperor ....
the emperor?
yes, he commands you make contact with him ....
move this ship out of the asteroid field and into a position where we can send a clear transmission.
yes, my lord.
and code the signal to my private chamber.
what are you so grouchy about?
sir, i'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
a tremor!
sir, it's very possible this asteroid is not stable.
why, princess, this is so sudden.
very funny.  you can let go now .... i'm getting angry.
you don't look angry.
how do i look?
beautiful.
sorry, captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
well, i hope you don't expect more.
i don't expect anything, except to be left alone.
fine with me.  but i'm afraid you'll have to let go.
you, too, golden rod.
i must admit there are times i don't understand human behavior.
... like we're being watched.
away put your weapon.  i mean you no harm.
i'm looking for someone.
looking?  looking?  you've found someone i'd say.  heh?  yes!
yeah ...
help you i can ... yes ... yes.
i'm looking for a great warrior.
a great warrior?  not many on those.  wars don't make one great.
listen, friend, we didn't mean to land here, and if i could get my fighter out of this puddle i would, but i can't.  so ...
can't get your ship out?  have you tried?  have you tried?
give me that!
mine!  mine!  or i'll help you not.
i don't want your help.  i want my lamp back.  i'll need it in this slimy mudhole.
mudhole?  slimy?  my home this is.
mine, mine.
okay, artoo, let him have it. now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
no, no!  i'll stay and help you find your friend.
i'm not looking for a friend. i'm looking for a jedi master.
oh, a jedi master.  different altogether.  yoda you seek, yoda.
you know the jedi master?
of course, yes.  but now eat we must.  good food, i have good food.  come, come.
that was no earthquake.
felt like a hydro concussion ... an imperial cruiser.
they're moving away.
they're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
where have i heard that before?
easy, your worship.  only trying to help.
would you please stop calling me that?
sure.  i guess i make it difficult sometimes.
yes, you do.
you could be a touch warmer, though.  admit it, against your better judgment you think i'm all right.
sometimes, maybe ... occasionally, when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
that's quite a compliment.
stop that.
why?
what are you afraid of?
afraid of?  certainly not you captain solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
don't count on it.  i happen to like nice men.
sure, they're safer.  you always know what they're going to do. trouble is, it gets a little dull.
there's nothing dull about a man i can depend on to be civilized.
you mean a man you can control.
i do not!
try and control this ...
... i told you, i'm not hungry.
patience.  it's time to eat.
look, it smells good.  i'm sure it's delicious   but i don't know why we can't see yoda now.
it's the jedi's time to eat, too.
will it take long to get there? how far away is he?
not far, not far.  be patient. soon you will see him.  why wish you become a jedi?
because of my father, i guess.
oh, your father ... a powerful jedi was he, powerful jedi.
how could you know my father? you don't even know who i am.  can't we get on with this already?
he will learn patience.
much anger in him, like in his father.
we've discussed this before.
ready are you?  what know you of ready?  i have trained jedi for 800 years.  my own counsel i'll keep on who is to be trained.
why not me?
to become a jedi takes the deepest commitment, the most serious mind.
he can do it.
this one i have watched a long time.  all his life has he looked away ... to the horizon, to the sky, to the future.  never his mind on where he was, on what he was doing.  adventure, excitement ...  a jedi craves not these things!
i have followed my feelings.
you are reckless!
he'll learn.
he's too old.  yes.  too old to start the training.
will he finish what he begins?
we've come this far ... he is our only hope.
i will not fail you.  i'm not afraid.
you will be, my young one.  heh. you will be.
what is thy bidding, my master?
there is a grave disturbance in the force.
i have felt it.
our situation is most precarious. we have a new enemy who could bring about our destruction.
our destruction?  who?
the son of skywalker.  you must destroy him ... or he will be our undoing.
he's not a jedi, he's just a boy. obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
you are weak!  i have seen it. the force is strong with him. he must be destroyed.
but, if he could be turned, he would be a powerful ally.
yes ... yes.  that would be a great asset.
he will join us or die, my master.
there's something out there!
where?
outside, in the cave.
it sounds like it's trying to get in.
i'm going to see what it is.
are you crazy!
look, we just got this bucket going again.  i'm not about to let some varmint tear it apart ...
looks like some kind of mynock.
there will be more of them.  they always travel in groups.  and there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. just what we need right now.
those star destroyers will spot us long before you can get into light speed.  you can't make the jump in this asteroid field.
strap yourself in, sweetheart, we're taking off!
but the tremors have stopped.
i see it chewie, hang on.
the entrance is collapsing!
we're doomed.  goodbye, mistress leia.  goodbye, captain ...
not collapsing, honey.  it's closing!  this is no cave ...
what??
oh my, no!
it would be in seven pieces, were you a jedi.
i thought i was in good shape.
yes, but by what standard, ask i?  forget your old measures. unlearn, heh, unlearn.
master, moving rocks is one thing, but this is a little different.
no!  no different!  the differences are in your mind.  throw them out! no longer of use are they to you.
okay.  i'll give it a try.
no.  try not.  do, do.  or do not. there is no try.
i can't. it's too big.
size has no meaning.  it matters not.  look at me.  judge me by my size do you?
i don't believe it.
that is why you fail.
i can see the edge of the asteroid field, sir.
good.  soon as we're clear, we'll kick this baby into hyperdrive.
couldn't be, i checked the transfer circuits, just like you said!  i tell you this time it's not my fault.  i'm sure i checked it.
no lightspeed?
it's not my fault.  i can't under- stand it!
sir, we've lost the rear deflector shield.  one more direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.
well, what now?
sharp bank, chewie.  let's turn this bucket around.  you heard me, turn around!  full power on the front shield.
you're going to attack them?!!!
concentration.  heh?  concentration.
i thought those seekers were set for stun!
that they are.
they're a lot stronger than i'm used to.
that would matter not were the force flowing through you.  higher you'd jump!  faster you'd move! open yourself to the force you must.
no, no.  this will not do.  anger is what you feel.
but i feel the force flowing!
anger, fear, aggression!  the dark side of the force are they.  easily they flow ... quick to join you in a fight.  beware, beware, beware of them.  a heavy price is paid for the power they bring.
price?  what do you mean?
the dark side beckons.  but if once start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.  consume you it will ... as it did obi-wan's apprentice.
lord vader ... is the dark side stronger?
no, no.  easier, quicker, more seductive.
but how am i to know the good side from the dark?
you will know.  when you are at peace ... calm ... passive.  a jedi uses the force for knowledge and defense.  never for attack.
but tell me why ...
no!  nothing more will i tell you now. clear your mind of questions ... quiet now be ... at peace ...
lord vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  the millennium falcon definitely went into lightspeed. it's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
alert all commands.  calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  don't fail me again, admiral, i've had quite enough!
yes, my lord.  we'll find them.
you could have warned him before you shut him off.
oh, so sorry!  didn't mean to offend your droid.  you think braking and shutting down in that amount of time is easy?
i'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
what'd you have in mind for your next move?
the fleet is finally breaking up. i'm hoping they'll follow standard imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
not bad, hot shot, not bad.  then what?
then we have to find a safe port around here.  got any ideas?
that depends.  where are we?
here ... near the anoat system.
funny, i have the feeling i've been in this area before.  let me check my logs.
you keep logs?  my, how organized.
well, sometimes ... ah-hah, i knew it!  lando calrissian.
never heard of that system.
lando's not a system, he's a man. a gambler, con-artist ... all- around scoundrel ...  ... your kind of guy.  the system is called bespin.  it's a ways from here, but reachable.
a mining colony.
a tibanna gas mine.  lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. lando and i go way back.
can you trust him?
no.  but he has no love for the empire, that much i know ...
you do have your moments ... not many, but you do have them.
let er go, chewie.
four this time!  the force you feel.
yes ... i also feel danger ... death.  something's not right.
i feel cold.
this tree is strong with the dark side of the force.  a servant of evil it is.  into it you must go.
what's in there?
only what you take with you.
rather touchy, aren't they.
i thought you knew this person.
well, it's been awhile.
barks and growls at his boss.
that was a long time ago.  i'm sure he's forgotten all about it, and so should you.
i don't like this.
it'll be all right.  trust me.  and keep your eyes open.  you wait here.
why you slimy, double-crossing no-good swindler ... am i glad to see you.
no hard feelings?
are you kidding?
i always said you were a gentleman.
i'll bet.
how you doing, chewbacca?  still wasting your time with this clown, eh?
growls a reserved greeting.
right.
hello!  what have we here?  welcome, i am baron lando calrissian, administrator of this facility ... and who might you be?
you may call me leia.
that won't be easy, my friend ... what brings you here, anyway?
repairs ...
what have you done to my ship?
that ship saved my life a few times.  it's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  what's wrong with her?
hyperdrive.
i'll have my people get to work on it right away.  hate the thought of the millennium falcon without her heart.
how's your mining operation going?
not as well as i'd like.  we're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  i've had supply problems of every kind and ...  what's so funny?
nothing.  i never would have guessed that underneath that wild schemer i knew was a respon- sible leader and businessman ... but you wear it well.
ben?  ben?
free your mind and return he will.
my mind fills with so many images.
control, control you must learn of what you see.  not easy, not fast.
i see a city in the clouds.
bespin.  i see it too ... friends you have there, heh?  concentrate and see them you will.
i see them! ... they're in pain ... they're suffering.
it is the future you see.
will they die?
difficult to see.  always in motion is the future ... back away, little machine!
they're my friends.
foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  you have far to go in your training.
what are you staring at?
who's staring?
you look silly.
you look great.
has threepio turned up yet?
huh?  oh.  your droid's been gone too long just to be lost.  he may have gotten into some trouble. chewie went to look for him.  come over here.  i want to check this out.
i hope luke made it to the fleet all right.
luke!  i'm sure he's fine.  probably sitting around wondering what we're doing right now.
barks at his master.
what happened?
he found him in a junk pile ...
something's wrong here.  your friend lando is very charming, but i don't trust him.
well, i do trust him.  lando's an old friend.  must have been an accident.
chewie, do you think you can repair him?
howls and shrugs his shoulders.
why don't we just turn him over to lando to fix?
no thanks.
look, sweetheart, i'm not going to have you accusing my friend of ...
sorry, am i interrupting anything?
not really.
i must say, your beauty is unpar- alleled.  truly you belong here with us among the clouds.
thanks.
would you care to join me for a little refreshment?
barks at the mention of food. licks his lips.
everyone's invited, of course.
.... we are a free station and do not fall under the jurisdiction of the empire.
you're part of the mining guild then?
not actually .... our operation is small enough not to be noticed, so you might say we're enterprisers. most of our trade is, well ... unofficial.
it's a lovely outpost.
yes, we keep pollution down by having the power reactor far below the city.  it's connected by a transfer shaft.
barks at han.
not now, chewie.  lando, aren't you afraid the empire might discover this little operation and shut you down?
sorry friend, i had no choice. they arrived right before you did.
i'm sorry too.
... luke, you must not go.
but han and leia will surely die.
you don't know that.  even i cannot see their fate.
i can help them!
you're not ready yet.  you still have much to learn.
i feel the force.
but you cannot control it.  this is a dangerous time for you, luke. you are now most susceptible to the temptations of the dark side.
yes, yes.  to obi-wan you listen young one.  the tree.  remember your failure at the tree!  heh?
i've learned so much since then.  and i'll return to finish ... i promise that, master.
will you?  you underestimate the emperor.  it is you he wants ... that is why your friends suffer.
and that is why i must go.
luke, i will not lose you to the emperor, as i lost vader.
you won't.
only a fully trained jedi knight, with the force as his ally, will conquer vader and his emperor. if you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path ... as vader did ... you will become an agent of evil ... and the galaxy will be plunged deeper into the abyss of hate, despair and pain that you feel your friends suffering now.
stopped they must be.  do you hear?  on this all depends.
you are the last jedi, luke.  you are our only hope.  be patient.
and sacrifice han and leia?
if it must be.  yes.
luke, use the force only for knowledge and for defense, not as a weapon.  don't give in to hate or anger or fear ... they lead the way to the dark side ... luke nods and climbs back into his ship.
strong is vader.  clouded is your fate.  mind what you have learned ... notice everything, everything!  it can save you.
told you, i did.  reckless is he ... now things are going to worse.
the boy is our last hope.
no ... there is another.
what about leia and the wookiee?
you will find them well enough. but they must never again leave this city.
that was never mentioned.  neither was this bounty hunter taking han. i hope you haven't forgotten our bargain.
i forget nothing, calrissian. perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.
no.
good.  it would be most unfortunate if i had to leave a permanent garrison here.
barks his concern.
no, i'm alright.  i'm alright.
i was worried about you.
i'm worried about all of us.  i can't figure out what they're up to.
me either.  they had me howling on the scan grid, but they never asked me any questions.
get out of here, lando!
shut up a minute and listen.  i'm doing what i can to make this easier for you.
this ought to be good.
vader agreed to turn leia and chewie over to me.  they'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.
what about han?
i didn't know you had a price on your head.  vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
you don't know much about much if you think vader won't want us dead before this is over.
he doesn't want you at all.  he's after someone named skywalker.
luke?  i don't get it.
lord vader has set a trap for him and ...
... we're the bait.
all this just to get the kid? what's so important about him?
don't ask me, but he's on his way.
don't shoot!  i've done what i can for you.  i'm sorry it's not better, but i've got my own problems.  i've already stuck my neck out further than i should ...
yeah, you're a real hero.
we only use this chamber for carbon freezing.  if you put him in there, it'll kill him.
i think not.  but i don't wish my prize to be damaged.  we'll test it first.  bring in captain solo.
barks a doleful farewell.
i'm sure i'll see you again, too. keep well.  you'd better chain him until it's over.
... i love you.  i couldn't tell you before, but it's true.
... just remember that, cause i'll be back ...
i'll take what's mine now.
take them, but i'm keeping a detachment of troops here to watch over them.
that wasn't the bargain.  you said the empire wouldn't interfere in--
i'm altering the bargain.  pray i don't alter it any further.
leia!
luke, no!  it's a trap.
what's going on?
i'm coming over to your side, that's what.  and i have a feeling i'm making a big mistake.
and when do you betray us again?
look, i stand to lose everything by this.
we have no use for your kind.
this is no time to be choosy, honey.  what do you say we debate this later?  there's still a chance i can get you out of here.
barks a blue streak.
what's wrong with him?
chewie's right.  we must try to save han.
there's not much chance, but the bounty hunter's ship is on the east landing platform.
the fear does not reach you.  you have learned more than i anticipated.
you'll find i'm full of surprises.
and i too.
your future lies with us, skywalker. now you will embrace the dark side. obi-wan knew this to be true.
no!
there is much obi-wan did not tell you.  come, the emperor will complete your training.
i'll die first.
that won't be necessary.
all too easy.  perhaps you are not as strong as the emperor thought.
time will tell.
we should have stayed and finished them off.
barks his agreement.
i don't care.  it would've been worth it .... for han.
barks his right on!
very noble.  not smart, but noble.
you've probably never done an honorable thing in your life.
sure i did ... once.  it turned out lousy.
what chance have we got in here? what are we going to do when they cut ...
... the power?
howls.
you'd better know what you're doing, or this is going to get very messy.
don't worry about a thing.  i'll get us going.
we've got to find luke.
his fate is sealed.  you'll be lucky to get out yourself.  all systems are on alert.  everything's locked.
the force runs strong in the skywalker line.  you will achieve great power ... come, join with me!  together we will be the most powerful ... even stronger than the emperor.
no! .... never ....
there is no escape.  you must join me or die.  don't make me destroy you here ... the emperor is strong with the force.  but if you join me, together we could overthrow him.  do not resist. it is our destiny!
never.
artoo, you did it!  i never doubted you for a second ...
let's go.
what'd you say?
i didn't say anything?
i knew that set-up was too good to last .... i'm going to miss it.
luke!
what?
luke needs help.  we must go back.
barks his consternation.
chewie, head for the bottom of the city.
three patrol ships are heading our way.
barks an argument and shakes his head.
no argument, just do it.  that's a command!
wait a minute.  we're not going back there.
turns on lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.
okay, okay.
someone's falling.
it's luke.  get under him.  slow down.  easy chewie.  line up your tracking system.  lando, open the hatch.
lando, is he alright? ... lando? are you there?  how's luke?
he'll survive.
howls.
we're not out of this yet.
the deflector shields are gone.
are the coordinates set?
this hyperdrive had better work.
i've never seen it fail.
i'm sure my men fixed it.  we've got nothing to worry about.
that sounds familiar.
okay, chewie, it's now or never.
barks his agreement.
