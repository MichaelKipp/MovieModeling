hi. hey.
kat.
you think we look like were trying too hard.
exactly. i want us to look like we fit, but not like were trying too hard to look like we fit.  its welcome cocktails, not prom. with this level of matchy-matchy, we should be drinking peach schnapps under a bleacher somewhere.
what color are my shoes?
you have feet?
dont patronize me. theyve clearly been at this a while.
youre funny.
yeah, but i feel like crap. and if you feel like crap, its way better to look hot while youre doing it.
mission accomplished.
really?  dont get too attached.
mmm.
mmm, nice dress? or mmm--  gorgeous, i was insane to let you go!
both.
you know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when theyre naked.
i dont do naked. my sister? she does naked.
dad!
hi, kiddo.
meet nick.
im guessing maccallum, 18 years.  neat, with a water-back.
is there any other way to take it?
why, jeffrey. hello.
hello, katmandu.
seeing you again....
yeah?
kat ellis! we live two hundred miles away from each other but i have to fly all the way to london to see you. you havent visited me once in d.c. where the hell have you been? i have gynecologists that call more often.
you have more than one gynecologist?
sure. youve got to play them against each other. otherwise they think youre easy.
you didnt have to do that.
i wasnt saving you from him. i was saving you from yourself.
whats he do anyway?
therapist.
you know what i love about all this?
theres finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
exactly! todays my day. tomorrow will be my day. and the day after that? my day.
perfect. all ginny.
except its scotch.
but im not taking your name, buster. im a feminist!  i need icey! mr. husband-man, get me more icey!
whos ever heard of dance lessons for a wedding, honestly?
um, just about everyone.
you are taking the piss?
hey.
oh, hello.
ah, a philosopher.
shrink, actually.
crikey.
what?
nothing, nothing.
no, tell me.
you yanks and your therapy. its great.  its all a bit too touchy-feely for me.
hey, kat.
hey, yourself.  i see youve met my ex.
the knicks game? we both wanted the last hot dog?
oh, yeah.  so we split it. you know, as in share. people do that.
well, he looks miserable. what were you talking about?
love.
jeffrey knows love like he knows macram.
he was pretty drunk, but i think hes still crazy about you.
of course he is. im here with my new man.  i love it! your magics already working. let the suffering begin.
what did he say exactly? i mean, you dont think he wants me back?
i dont know.
what does your gut say?
youre too good for him.
wheres nick sleeping?
why, with you.
my mother has a rule about men and women sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture. she thinks its--
huh?
im not as square as my daughter thinks.
no, count it, anyway.
why?
im compulsive and weird?
six thousand, right?
on the nose.  i tell you what, because youre so cute, ill take care of our incidentals.
how does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
great, with the occasional stabs of shame. now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
that wont be an issue, believe me. i find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  no offense.
its okay. hell, ive never paid for it. but please dont feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
you quitting?
im desperate to start but i dont have an addictive personality. except for approval. that, i cant get enough of.
who are they?
graham russell and russell hitchcock.
what?
its cute.
what is?
you stand on your tiptoes.
i do?
have you ever done anything like this before?
a weekend?
a wedding.
not the way youre thinking. the women wanted me there for support. you can understand that.
i think thats disgusting.
not you. youre not disgusting. youre lovely. just the idea that theyd bring an escort. i mean, a stranger who, um, didnt...who never.... i mean, someones dead.
thats right. imagine facing it alone.
sorry. im a little nervous. i never thought something like this would happen to me.
this happened to you?
well, happen, in the sense that i picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401k.
how did you know that was me?
i have a friend at the magazine.
your friend guaranteed my anonymity.
if it makes you feel any better, to get your number, i had to cough up two round-trip tickets to amsterdam and a case of mini-baileys.
would you grab my shampoo?
shampoo, got it!
the real story is that my mother was a hippie. and a stripper. she was insanely inappropriate with me. she used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. while i was still in the bath.
oh, no.
yeah. as an adult, i needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldnt be violated.
you shit!
i have a different story for every woman who asks. i look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
and you thought id respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
admit it. you were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
so...what was i...oh, yeah. do you honestly think that i want to be single and miserable? that i want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
first of all, its never out of the blue. and second of all--
yes.
what?!
when youre ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. until then....
are you asking me if im gay for pay?
i guess so.
what do you think?
moms refining her strategy for dday.
im sure general eisenhower never had to master the finer points of the seating chart and centerpieces.  oh, and tomorrow afternoon you are carpooling to the country with the fletcher-wootens.
sir, yes, sir!
theres a guy on 81st and madison. you get your results in 24 hours.  do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?
my sixth-grade science project was entitled, love hurts: the heartbreak of human papillomavirus. trust me, im careful.
i love that youre asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
this is awkward for me.  talking about it makes me feel better.
dont stop asking questions, okay?
okay.
i swear. i dont have a signature move.
oh, come on. youre like the yoda of escorts.
subtle?
i disappear. its not about me.
its hard to explain.
show me.
come on.
ive got this bad taste in my mouth. what is it? i think its the words: morally repugnant.
whats his problem?
what?
theres something about him thats just a bit odd.
other than, hes shagging your exgirlfriend?
no, thats not it.
remember when we went hiking in the lake district and amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
no.
it was before you started going out. we had lunch at that inn on the lake.
oh, yes. right. the rat and parrot.
and kat was fully clothed.
but, somehow, it was kats arse that was stung by nettles. and you rubbed it with a dandelion leaf.
thats when i realized i wanted to be a doctor.
oh, shut up. youre an optician.
lasik surgeon, actually.
i didnt deserve her back then.
and you do now?
im worried. amys not good at drinking. she gets sooo drunk sooo fast. does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  is it drunker or drunker-er?
just drunk enough.
not yet...
...but its getting there.
i thought you were living in san francisco. or was it nepal?
close. sydney. turns out, i missed the rain.
i always wondered what happened with us.
i havent thought about that in years.
did kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
did amy tell you she keeps her homecoming tiara by the bed?
shes drunk. -er than me. but i didnt really dump you, did i?
hard.
christ, amy.
oh, shut up and be happy. its always this or that. youre never happy, you frowny-faced grumplestilskin.
drunk isnt the same thing as happy, amy.
why dont you get my half sister her seventh hole?
bacardi 151.
i dont think i can go through with this.
pub golf?
the wedding.  i am so, so bad! i dont think i should be allowed to get married.
just because some slags been paid for, doesnt mean youve got to...you know.
its been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute.  you did the right thing.
i think i love you, mate.  how do you know so much about so much?
im a hooker.
do you want to come in for a minute? we could talk about--
when i freaked out at the pub?  that was nothing, just nerves. dont worry about it.
but i do. i will. youre my sister.
god, kat! please. dont be nice to me. i can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
what? why? what do you mean?
i should get going.
are you sure youre okay?
im fine. i promise.
are you sure?
we kissed. made out a little. then you passed out.
is this for last night?
of course not. how...how could it be? nothing happened.
if i was going to charge you, i would have told you beforehand. i thought i explained that.
dont they have a limit at those machines?
not if you take an advance on your credit card.
i am now, sir.
at least somebodys using the damn thing.  i was gonna fix her up but we took one trip and the kids fought so much, we never launched her again.
thats not true. we checked for leaks a few years back.  good morning.
ahoy!
so youre telling me. if something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? thats a down payment on a ford focus!
not dollars. pounds.
and what if i didnt want you to...to do that to me?
no, no. the three hundred is for you doing it to me.
what?
believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. for you.
but nothing did.
yup. thats why you get to keep your money.
id be happy to. youre welcome.
oh, dont be that way.
hey, sal.
i heard you were back in town, kitty cat. youre here for the highland flings, i bet.
i get all the glamour jobs.
the one i made for you is the cherries. you hang onto it or give it back?
give it back? are you nuts?
you pawned it.
not exactly. i wear it.  on my right hand. and only rarely.
you want i nut him in the boat?
yes? no. what?  save the patter for the tourists.
you want me to let him in?
of course, dont be silly.
hey, you!
let me guess. amy presumed id forget the rings.  i think im her least favorite person.  you know, i am sorry.
maybe not her least... theres always--
so, tell me, hows unmarried life?
i have regrets.
whoa, jeffrey. slow down. you and me, were the past. im not sure if you noticed, but im here with someone else.
kat, we must talk. this guy, theres something not quite right.
its called character. god, youre predictable.
is that why you brought him? because of me.
kat, wait. i dont want you hating me. weve never had this talk. you know how crap i am at this.
um, news flash: i dont give a shit.
kat, stop it. you do. you cant even look me in the eye. you went back to the states when we split up.
that was a long time ago.
it was. and it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
so, whats your point?
i should have told you why i broke up with you. i was a coward. you deserve to know.
hey, man.
sorry, can you give us a moment?
no, i cant. were late for a dance lesson. i guess youll have to finish up later.
hello, goodbye, i want you, i hate you. its all just words. none of it means anything. what matters is what you do. you either stay put or you walk away. if you look back, youre not walking away!
oh, cut the crap!
i just hate seeing you so stuck.
he was about to un-stick me!  i paid you to help me get closure.
you paid me for a lot of reasons. closure wasnt one of them.
im sorry i was such a bitch. i really appreciate your doing this.
its my job.
i thought you said you were crap.
i had to say something to get you here.
fair enough, but im stepping on toes here and youre waltzing around like...
fred astaire and whats her face!
its not me. i swear. its her. shes magic.
youd better get going. my parents will be round to cart you off to the country.
whatever you do, dont mention italy. or politics. or baby buggies.  or edith piaf.
your probably best off pretending youre asleep.
you have had girlfriends?
sure, but its never easy. they say theyre okay with it, and they are...for a while. then one day, theyre not.
when i said id never done a wedding before, i didnt say that no one ever asked. i just never said yes.
so, whyd you say yes to me?
there was something in your voice on the phone that day.
desperation?
what would you do if you were not an escort?
make out with you for free.
what would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
spontaneously combust?
what is it you do again?
what would you say if i told you i was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nations most precious resource: your daughter.
what do you say to that?
i say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass--
--and the ass of the man who adores her.
hey, sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
will do.
sorry to interrupt. your dad sent me.
what for?
to make sure youre okay.
you know all that if these walls could talk stuff? do you believe it? that a place has a memory?
actually, i do.
it was such a long time ago.
still--
if ed ever found out....
or kat....
and she wonders why i swim to the bottom of a lemondrop every time i see her.
you were so good to me. i swear i never meant to hurt you. we were together what, five years?
seven if you count the on-and-off years. which i do.
right. seven.  christ, thats a long time, isnt it?
not for a dog.
well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
is this supposed to be an apology?
its not supposed to be anything, kat. its just my rather feeble attempt to.... oh, i dont know.  you see, i thought i could deny my feelings--
youre not even listening.
when we were together i was too here, now im not here enough.
yeah. you?
yeah.
i blame tony pee-pants!
oh, no.  she tells this story at every major holiday.
why should this be any different?  besides, i have to initiate nick into the family.
she blames tony pee-pants pinterello for everything. the fall of the british empire, the cold war, the internet.
it was just after we moved here. my little girls got in a fight over tony pee-pants and they havent made up since.
we were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, tony walked me home from school. he was my first boyfriend.  i was fourteen.
so tony pee-pants starts ignoring kat. he wanted to play with me.
you practically bribed him with your erector set.
fourteen and hes hoodwinked by a an erector set?
i didnt say he was worth it.
like fifteen.
dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
im an american and in america, people sue. so to prevent a lawsuit, i baked a tart. and i dont bake.
so dad rang the bell and when tony pee-pants opened the door, i threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
and thats when he peed in his pants? after the tart?
he bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
so whats with the nickname?
bollocks, im sorry. i had no idea this would be so difficult.
relax. take a breath and just say it. its no big deal. i promise.
brilliant.
well, it was a big deal. as late as...yesterday. or this morning.  but not anymore.
its the past. its nothing but ghosts. so just get it off your chest, then lets go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
i slept with your sister.
im sorry?
i shagged amy. two years ago. thats why i ended it. and then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. and, you know, morally wrong. then there was that one other time. and that was it.
oh, no. he told you.
you knew?
im so sorry.
nothing.
doesnt look like nothing.
besides, you hired me for my discretion.
youve always got that to hide behind, dont you? its just business!
yeah! for all i know, come monday morning, well go back to the real world and...and youll be hiring me for your best friend!
you let me make a fool of myself! you lied to me! i dont know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. its your job. its who you are. how would you even know if something were real?
youre judging me?! oh, thats a good one. youre lying to me, youre lying to your family, and youre lying to yourself. but youre going to stand there and point a finger at me? the man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
youre right. i was so desperate to make everyone believe i was happy that i spent six grand on a lie. and after all that? the only one who ended up falling for it was me.
go ahead, kat. hate me. you were running out of steam on the whole jeffrey thing. maybe now youll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
ill just check into a hotel.
dont be ridiculous. its late and the place is empty. just take my car.
hey.
hey.
you know what? im not having this conversation right now.
sure, disappear. weve been walking away our whole lives.
whats going on with you two?
i was pretty hard on her last night.  and now shes getting married.
theres a reason i always tell that tony pee-pants story, you know.
trust me. this is bigger than tony pee-pants.
before tony, you and your sister were best friends. i couldnt split you up. if your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. if you threw up--.
mom, please.
anyway, when that boy came over, it was the first time you ever did anything without her.  and amy wasnt just jealous...she was sad and lonely. she missed you.
she did?
so she flirted with tony, and you got mad and sent him away. who did that leave?  you and amy. reunited.
wow. you look beautiful.
yeah. most important day of my life. whatever. listen, i chose you to be my maid of honor for a lot of reasons: i love you, youre my favorite, and only, half-sister, blah blah blah. but the main reason i picked you is because youve been so miserable for the past few years, i knew you wouldnt outshine me.  but here it is, my big day. my big day. and something doesnt feel right. maybe it was that pep talk you gave me last night, i dont know, but your misery just isnt working for me anymore.
so whyd you let him go?
its complicated, dad.
oh, well, then. it probably wont work out.
yeah.
then for once in your life, do something for yourself.
say something. please.
i knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. i never in a million years would have dreamt it was jeffrey.
does kat know?
jeffrey told her last night.
last night?
i look like a total wanker, dont i?
yeah, kind of.
you heading to the train station?
i figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
yeah.
hi.
hi.
i should go.
what?! no, no. you cant--
i have to.  im the best man.
nice speech. i thought it was touching... and funny.
thank you.
