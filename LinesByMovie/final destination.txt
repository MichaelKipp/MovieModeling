man, that is one george michael notch from being gay.
dude, get wisdom. we're about to board a seven hour flight. the toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. what if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in christa or blake?  you want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
fag.
c'mon, man, like you really thought you were gonna tittie fuck 'em over greenland, or something?
because of you, i gotta sit here and watch fuckin' "stepmom."
i'll remove him.
fuck you! i'll remove myself!
and then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. the the whole plane... blew up. it was so real. exactly how everything goes.
been on many planes that blew up, have you?
you're payin' for my trip, browning!
i wish you were on the plane!
how would i know? you think i'm some sort of...
he's not a witch.
i got this... feeling... a weird feeling... i can't explain it...
did you take any sedatives before boarding, or on the plane. sleeping pills?
no. i saw it. i saw it!
hope you don't think, browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that i owe you anything.
i don't.
all i owe is these people.  to live my life to the fullest.
me, too.  but my dad doesn't understand. when he's better; you and me, road trip to the city. catch the yanks.
that's a plan.
it's only the end of june.
yeah, but everything's always in transition. if you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel autumn coming.  almost like bein' able... to see the future.
you went there? i've wanted to go there, but i thought it was off limits.
it is. but that didn't stop me. shouldn't stop you.
not a likeness. it's how you make me feel, alex.
i'm... really sorry.
like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. reluctant to take form. and, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehensible attraction.
that's why i was there last night.
i've never dealt with death before. i wasn't alive when my grandparents died. i wish i could know. i mean, all this... could just be in our heads. now it feels like it's everywhere.
"it?"
what if tod... is just the first... of us?
is that something you're "feeling?"
i don't know. i wish i could just see him... one more time, then, maybe...  i would know.
then, let's go see him!
this place?!
doin' somethin' i'm not supposed to.
that... him?
i think. but why'd they make him up like... michael jackson?
that's him, but... he's not here.
ahhh! fuck! you fucking asshole. you think this is funny, you fucking dick? tod, if you're not dead i'm gonna fucking kill you!
ohmygod! ohmygod!  ohmygod!  he's not dead?
i'm... a friend of his. his best friend. see, his father...
i know who you are.
cuticle lacerations.
why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide?
his father's pretty fucked up with denial. maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son.
in death...
... there are no accidents. no coincidencess. no mishaps.  and no... escapes.
you saying tod did kill himself?
you may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of death's sadistic design leading to the grave.
design?
i'm sorry we broke in.
no harm. no foul.
he said death has a design. even before he said that i had been seeing patterns.
as in flannels and plaids?
how many died on flight 180?  from our group?
thirty-nine.
remember the gate number?
no.
thirty-nine.
remember the departure time?
like... 4:25.
4:25.
right. april 25th.
wait. i thought you meant the time of your birth. four/twenty-five, as in, month and day... that's a reach.
i'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. i'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. that, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane.
that's total bullshit. you can find death omens anywhere you want to.
i don't understand... did you see tod die? did it happen again, like on the plane?
no, but it might as well be the same thing. this was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design.
alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. but here... you're suggesting tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active presence.
we're losing our favorite teacher.
look, there's something you should all know.
i believe that... ms. lewton's next.
"next?"
yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
oh, you've noticed it, too?
alex... can you promise me that no one else will die?
no... i can't. as long as i'm in here, it's outta my control.
what are you doing?
terry's name should be on this wall.
so, why'd you want us to meet you here? now?
they're watching me, see if i go to alex.
and don't pass on the right.
billy! i'm gettin' a vision!  you're the next one...
hey, man, why'd you say that?!
'cause if you say another word, i'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
most kids do, i guess.
most kids never have it happen.
those guys are probably fifteen minutes away.
no.. i mean, i don't have anything on me. this won't be safe.
nothing is... anymore.
i can't go home. after lewton's, they'll be after me.
we're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house.  keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us.
alright, browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about ms. lewton, or what?
why do you think i was hiding?
billy told the f.b.i. he saw you runnin' away from her house.
they blame me for everything. her, tod, the plane crash...
please tell me i'm gonna get to see the jets win the super bowl.
me, right? that's why you're not saying.
shoulda' felt up tammy in the pool, that time...
whatta' you whinin' about? he said i'm next.
he didn't say nothin'. just drive.
you have a responsibility to tell me.
is knowing going to make it easier? it makes it harder.
you get off havin' control over me. let me choose how to deal with it.
it doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list.
knock it off!
may as well go out under my own free will, right?
not with us in the fuckin' car!
what's your fuckin' worry? if it's not your time...? i could get nailed runnin' this red light and you all wouldn't get shit! only me, right?
no!
get control of yourself!
that's what i'm doin'!
i know what you're doing!  it's alright to be scared, carter. you don't have to prove to us how big your balls are. not now.
i'm not afraid! i decide when it's time! i control my life! i control my death!
stop the car!
let us out!
can't you open the door?!
easy, billy, just open it.
carter, get out!
don't do it! don't do it!
get out! get out of the car!  get out of the fuckin' car!
get out! get out of the car!
it broke!
no one's that strong.
shut up, billy!
we don't need this now!
you should have been next. after lewton, you should've been next. that's the only pattern. you should be dead.
you're the fuckin' devil.
but i saved him. i intervened. just like the plane. that's the design.
police are coming.
that's why it skipped carter and went to the next one in the path of the explosion; billy.
my intervention in the death of 180 survivors will cheat the design.
"intervention?" what are you, god now?!
of course not! gods aren't afraid to die! gods don't die! we do!
you know what to do.
no! no! don't!
when i do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over.
