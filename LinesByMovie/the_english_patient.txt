there is meant to be lace in the next village - the boys are taking me.
I am not sewing anything else.
you do not have any money, do you? just in case there is silk.
no!
hana, i know you do!
I am not sewing anything else for you!
i love you.
hey!  hey!  stop!  hey!
do not move!  stand absolutely still! hana stops.
the war's over - you told me yourself. how can it be desertion?
it is not over everywhere.  i did not mean literally.
when he dies I will catch up.
it is not safe here.  the whole country's crawling with bandits and germans and god knows what.  it is madness.  i can not allow it. you are not, this is natural - it is shock. for all of us.  hana -
i need morphine.  a lot.  and a pistol.
and what if he really is a spy?
he can not even move.
if anything happened to you I would never forgive myself.
there was a prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at pisa so he could die with a view of the tuscan hills. am i that prince? hana laughs.
because you are leaning?  no, you are just on an angle.  you are too heavy!
marvelous plane.  did you look?
is not it?  wedding present from katharine's parents.  I am calling it rupert bear.  hello.  geoffrey clifton.
we can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap. almsy smiles and walks on towards the others.
thank you.
i wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
a thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it.  big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car.
a broken car?
still a car.
uxoriousness - that is my favorite kind of love.  excessive love of one's wife.
there you have me.
what was all the banging?  were you fighting rats or the entire german army?
i was repairing the stairs.  i found a library and the books were very useful.
before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
i think they are all in italian, but I will look, yes.  what about your own book?
my book?  the herodotus?  yes, we can read him.
oh - I have found plums.  we have plums in the orchard.  we have an orchard! she has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
thank you.
i think you know all of us, except for geoffrey and katharine clifton, who have recently come out from england.
apprentices.
this is clive fenelon-barnes.
is not zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
what kind of fossils?
i can not sing.  but i can tell a story.  i might need a prompt.  do you have your herodotus?  I have noticed you carry it
I am sorry - what have you noticed?
your book.  your herodotus! almsy looks uncomfortable.
it does not matter.  really.  i think i can muddle through.  okay - the story of candaules and gyges. king candaules was passionately in love with his wife -  one day he said to gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -
daskylus
yes, thank you, gyges, son of daskylus - candaules said to him i do not think you believe me when i tell you how beautiful my wife is. and although gyges replied he did find the queen magnificent the king insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women.  do you all know this story?
i will hide you in the room where we sleep, said candaules. she stumbles over the word.
candaules
candaulesyou're laughing at me.
I am not laughing at you.  go on, please.
when my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure
but then the queen looked up and saw gyges concealed in the shadows. and though she said nothing, she shuddered. the next day she sent for gyges and challenged him.  and hearing his story, she said this -
off with his head!
are you asleep?
yes.  dropping off.
what did you think you were doing in his tent?
looking for the fossils.  why should we wait until we are in london?  this girl was probably twelve years old.
you should not go into another man's tent. it is inexcusable.
her hands and feet were tied.
what did you do?
i looked at them.  they are shrubs, small trees.  exquisite.  and fossilized, rock hard. he walks away to the nose of the plane.
i was talking about the girl.
cut the ropes.  i left a note, on his blanket.  at the next geographical society i shall await with great interest the announcement of the fenelon-barnes slave knot.  the girl would not leave, of course.  her father had sold her for a camel. he turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
i should try and move your bed.  i want you to be able to see the view.  it is good, it is a view from a monastery.
i can already see.
how?  how can you see anything?
not the window - i can not bear the light anyway - no, i can see all the way to the desert.  I have found the lost fossils.
I am turning you.
zerzura, the white city of acacias, the oasis of little birds.  as me about the scent of acacia - it is in this room.  i can smell it.  the taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  i can taste it. I am chewing the mint.  is there sand in my eyes?  are you cleaning sand from my ears?
no sand.  that is your drugs speaking.
i can see my wife in that view.
are you remembering more?
could i have a cigarette?
are you crazy?
why are you so determined to keep me alive?
because I am a nurse.
how are you?
okay.
your leg will be fine.  a lot of shrapnel came out - i saved you the pieces.
you are the prettiest girl i ever saw.
no, I will get you some tea. wait till you are in naples.  you will find a girl there.
just kiss me.  it would mean such a lot to me.
would it? she kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
thank you.
whoa - give me a chance!
sorry.  i took a benzedrine.
I have got a surprise.  a boat!  we can go to capri.  it is got a cabin, it is private.
I would like to spend a night with you in a bed.
we can do that when we are very, very old.
buon' giorno! hana turns, startled and suspicious.
are you hana?
what do you want?
i met your friend mary.  she said i should stop and see if you were okay. apparently we are neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in montreal. cabot, north of laurier.  bonjour.
bonjour.
they are fresh.  i have not eaten an egg inhave you noticed there are chickens? you get chickens in italy but no eggs. in africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. who separates them?
you were in africa?
yeah, for a while.
so was my patient.
I would like to stay.  that is the long and short of it.  i mean, you know blah-blah if it is convenient, if there is room blah-blah-blah.  i have to do some work here -i speak the language. there are partisans to be -  -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug.  i was a thief, so they think I would be good at that.
so you can shoot a pistol?
no.
if you said yes i would have had a reason.  you should let me redress those bandages.  before you go.
I am okay.  look, it is a big house. we need not disturb each other.  i can shoot a pistol!  I will sleep in the stables.  i do not care where i sleep.  i do not sleep.
because we are fine here.  i do not know what mary told you about me, but i do not need company, i do not need to be looked at.
fine.  I am not looking.
there is a man downstairs.  he brought us eggs.  he might stay.
why?  can he lay eggs?
he is canadian.
why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place?  what happened in montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
he need not disturb you.
me?  he can't.  I am already disturbed.
he will not disturb us then.  i think he is after morphine.  there is a war.  where you come from becomes important.  and besides - we are vulnerable here. i keep hearing noises in the night. voices.
how much did you pay?
hello!  good morning.
they do not see foreign women in this market.  how much did you pay?
seven pounds, eight, i suppose. why?
which stall?
excuse me?
you have been cheated, do not worry, we will take it back.
i do not want to go back.
this is not worth eight pounds, mrs. clifton.
i do not care to bargain.
that insults them.
i do not believe that.  i think you are insulted by me, somehow. you are a foreigner too, are not you, here, in this market?
i should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this.  i apologize if i appear abrupt.  i am rusty at social graces.  how do you find cairo?  did you visit the pyramids?
excuse me.
of course.  well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
oh no, really.  she has her book.
i will not hear of it.  none of us will.
mrs. clifton, you will have to forgive us.  we are not accustomed to the company of women.
not at all.  i was thoroughly enjoying by book.  please.  signor d'agostino, herr bermann.
the team is in mourning, darling.
oh really?
I am afraid we are not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
how awful.  what will you do?
a more modest expedition, or even wait a year.  remind our families we still exist.
good heavens, are you married, madox?
very much so.  we are all, save my friend here.
why did you follow me yesterday?
excuse me?
after the market, you followed me to the hotel.
i was concerned.  as i said, women in that part of cairo, a european women, i felt obliged to.
you felt obliged to.
as the wife of one of our party.
so why follow me?  escort me, by all means.  following me is predatory, is not it?
i was just saying, I am going to cable downing street, see if i can not stir up a few shillings - katharine's mother and the pm's wife are best -
darling, for goodness' sake!
well, she is!
hello.
finally!  so you are our canadian pickpocket?
thief, i think, is more accurate.
i understand you were in africa. whereabouts?
oh, all over.
all over?  i kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed.  are you leaving us?  now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
i think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
are you planning to be the exception?
me?  you have got the wrong end of the stick, old boy.  so - caravaggio - hana thinks you invented your name.
and you have forgotten yours.
i told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
i told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
what about your rank or serial number?
no.  i think i was a pilot.  i was found near the wreckage of a plane by the bedouin.  i was with them for some time.
am i being interrogated?  you should be trying to trick me.  ask me about tottenham hotspur.  or buckingham palace. about marmite - i was addicted.  or make me speak german, which i can, by the way.
why?  are you german?
no.
how do you know you are not german if you do not remember anything?
you tell me.  i remember a lot of things. i remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the devil's chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and france.
this was your garden?
or my wife's.
then you were married?
i think so.  although i believe that to be true of a number of germans. might i have a glass of water?
excuse me -
yes?
can i ask - my friend, can he come in? just for a few minutes?
your friend?
he is going back to the front this evening.  i can not see him otherwise.
just go off.  I will be quite all right.
no, i can not go, but if it, if you were not offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. this is as private as we will get.
well then - yes.  of course.
thank you.  thank you.
this is captain mcgann.
please, do not waste your time on pleasantries -
you have got a mustache.
a bit of one.
i was looking forward to this evening.
i had a hotel room.
i thought that was for when we were very very old?
I am feeling old.
supper. hana calls after him.
where have you been?
rabbit hunting.
i could help you.  i could get you off that.
can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
it is a week.  we did not know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
you should be happy.  what were you going to do for him when it ran out? he pulls out more phials from his jacket.
what do you do?  what are you doing here?
some gave me a dress.  you know what is great?  what I am learning? you win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. everywhere i go, we are in the right. i like that.
something smells so rich.  my stomach is heaving -
he came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I am cooking it.
that is a different dress.
he keeps asking me questions about you. do you know him?  do you recognize him?
do i recognize him?  i recognize what he is. i like him.  he is canadian.  he can read italian.  he can catch rabbits.
this is an incredible story - about a man hunting an ostrich, he is been telling me about zerzura, he thinks he is been there, but his map, the route he is describing, he could not survive the journey now, but he is a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we are onto an ostrich.  I am telling her your map is poetry. the arab shrugs.
what do you mean, poetry?
a mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
sounds perfectly clear.  where does the ostrich come in?
the ostrich is a detour.  a poor man hunts an ostrich, it is the method.  nothing to do with zerzura.  to catch an ostrich you must appear not to move.  the man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and does not move, does not eat - otherwise the ostrich will run.  at nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards.  when the ostrich comes the next day, the man is there, but he is nearer.  haunting the ostrich.
what is he saying?  come on, what did he say?
he said - be careful.
be careful?  you mean you - or me? who?
her or me?
and a special thank you to geoffrey and katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. they toast the cliftons.
to arm-twisting.
did katharine say? - geoffrey has to fly back to cairo.
have to return the favor - take a few photographs for the army.
darling, peter says i could stay
why not?
what kind of photographs?
portraits.  the brigadier, the brigadier's wife, the brigadier's dogs, the brigadier at the pyramids, the brigadier breathing.
why do you think?  about my staying?
well look, if nobody minds, truly, then i suppose - i shall, of course, be bereft
oh.
but finally able to explore the cairo night-life. i shall produce an authoritative guide to the zinc bars and - i want to say harems - am i in the right country for harems?
safe journey.
you too.  good luck!
clifton - your wife - do you think it is appropriate to leave her?
appropriate?
i think the desert is, it is - for a woman - it is very tough, i wonder if it is not too much for her.
are you mad?  katharine loves it here. she told me yesterday.
all the same, i, were i you i would be concerned -
I have known katharine since she was three, my aunt is her aunt, we were practically brother and sister before we were man and wife.  i think I would know what is and what is not too much for her.  i think she is know herself.
very well.
why are you people so threatened by a woman?!
actually, you sing.
pardon?
you sing.  all the time.
i do not.
ask al auf. almsy asks al auf in arabic.
I will be back as quick as i can. thirty-six hours at the outside.
try to get a second radiator, we will bury it between here and the pottery hill. and a better jack. we planned badly.
bermann!
certainly not.
i insist.  there clearly is not room for us all, I am the least able to dig, and I am not one of the walking wounded. those are facts.  besides, if i remain it is the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he is doing and rescue us. it is hard to argue with this logic.
what is this?
i thought you might paste them into your book.
we took several photographs, there is no need.
I would like you to have them.
there is really no need.  this is just a scrapbook.  i should feel obliged.  thank you.
and that would be unconscionable, i suppose, to feel any obligation? yes.  of course it would.
you should come into the shelter.
I am quite all right, thank you.
look over there.
what am i looking at?
see what is happening to them - the stars.
they are so untidy.  I am just trying to rearrange them.
in an hour there will be no stars. the air is filling with sand.
this is not very good, is it?
no.
shall we be all right?
yes.  absolutely.
yes is a comfort.  absolutely is not.
- there is the harmattan, a red wind. which mariners called the sea of darkness.  red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of england, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. almasy checks to see if katharine is still awake.
fiction.  we had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. go on.  more.
all true.  herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind - the simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised.
madox will have calculated how many miles, they will soon turn around.
oh my god, the others!
could i ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book?  i should like to have them.  i should be honored.
of course.  is it, am i a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
water?  yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. not at all cowardly, extremely practical.  come on, come on!  there is also a plant - I have never seen it but I am told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
find that plant.  cut out its heart.
geoffrey's not in cairo.  he is not actually a buffoon.  and the plane was not a wedding present. it belongs to the british government.  they want aerial maps of the whole north africa. so i think he is in ethiopia.  in case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
and the marriage - is that a fiction?
no, the marriage is not a fiction.
do they know them?
no, but i think i do.
will you not come in?
no.
will you please come in?
mrs. clifton - katharine turns, disgusted.
don't.
i believe you still have my book.
I am impressed you can sew.
good.
you sew very badly.
you do not sew at all!
a woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  close your eyes.
that makes it harder still.
when were you most happy?
now.
when were you least happy?
now.
okay.  and what do you love? say everything.
what do i love?  i love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! the gardens at our house in freshwater - all my secret paths.
what else?
marmite - addicted!  baths - not with other people!  islands.  your handwriting.  i could go on all day.  my husband. almsy nods.
what do you hate most?
a lie.  what do you hate most?
ownership.  being owned.  when you leave, you should forget me.
could i ask you to move?  I am sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, i can not really bear the sheets moving over me. sorry.
yes, of course, I am so sorry. stupid of me. hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
why picton?
he is from there - edge of lake ontario right, soldier?
where is your stuart from? somewhere near there, is not it?

third canadian fusiliers.
does he know a captain mcgann? the boy hears this, whispers to oliver.
he is gone, has not he?
no.  he is - no.
oh god.  oh god.
hana?  hana?  are you alright?
do not touch me if you are going to try and fuck me.
I will have some of your water.  it is hot.
you have to protect yourself from sadness.  this is the thing I have learned.  you are in love with him, are not you? your patient.  do you think he is a saint or something?  because of the way he looks?  i do not think he is.
I am not in love with him.  I am in love with ghosts.  and so is he. he is in love with ghosts.
who are his ghosts?
ask him.
what if i told you he did this to me?
what?  how could he have?  when?
I am one of his ghosts and he would not even know.  it is like he slammed a door in cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in tobruk.
i do not know what that means.
ask him.  ask your saint who he is. ask him who he is killed.
please do not creep around this house.
tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - december 22nd - betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  new lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire  i love that, i believe that.  who is k?
k is for katharine.
say you are sick.
what?  no!
say you are feeling faint - the sun.
no.
i can not work.  i can not sleep. lady hampton calls impatiently.
katharine!
coming.  i can not sleep.  i woke up shouting in the middle of the night. geoffrey thinks it is the thing in the desert, the trauma.
i can still taste you.
this is empty, just coming!
I am trying to write with your taste in my mouth.  swoon.  I will catch you.
you should sit down, darling.  she is quite all right.  are you pregnant?
i do not think so.
how romantic.  with fiona i fell over every five minutes.  ronnie christened me lady downfall.
i think i might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
I will come with you.
no, please.  i shall be absolutely fine. they pass almsy, who does not look up from his book.
have you seen katharine?
what?
it is geoffrey under this.
i haven't, no.  sorry.
darling, i just heard.  you poor sausage, are you all right?
I am fine.  i got hot.
lady h said she thought you might be -
I am not pregnant.  I am hot.  I am too hot.
right.
are not you?
sweltering.  come on, I will take you home.
can not we really go home?  i can not breathe. are not you dying for green, anything green, or rain, would not you die to feel rain on your face? it is christmas and it is all - i do not know - if you asked me I would go home tomorrow.  if you wanted.
sweetheart, you know we can not go home, there might be a war.
geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
i do so love you.  what do you smell of?
what?
marzipan!  i think you have got marzipan in your hair.  no wonder you are homesick.
are you outside? a beat and then caravaggio shuffles in.  like an old boxer.
i can not hide anymore.  i breathe like a dog.  i lose my balance.  stealing's got harder. caravaggio stares at the herodotus.
why do i feel if i had your book i would know everything?
i do not even know if it is my book. the bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage.  it is mine now. i heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I am dying for rain - of course I am dying anyway - but i long to feel rain on my face.
is it you?  if i said moose i look different, fuck, why should not you?
moose.
first wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
i do not know.  paper.  is it? paper?  i do not remember.
excuse me.  yes?  i do not have the key to that door.
the germans were here.  the germans were all over this area.  they left mines everywhere.  pianos were their favorite hiding places.
i see.  then may be you are safe as long as you only play bach.  he is german. kip is looking around the piano. hana giggles.
is something funny?
no, but, no, not at all.  I am sorry. you came to the doors, that is all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  that is all.
I have met you before.
i do not think so.
he wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. he thinks I am mad because i laughed at him.  he is indian, he wears a turban.
sikh.  if he wears a turban, he is a sikh.
I will probably marry him.
really?  that is sudden.
my mother always told me i would summon my husband by playing the piano.
i liked it better when there were just the two of us.
why?  is he staying?
with his sergeant.  a mr. hardy.
we should charge!  does not anyone have a job to do?
they have to clear all the local roads of mines.  that is a big job. they will not stay in the house. they are putting up their tent in the garden.
in that case, i suppose we can not charge.
this is - what is this?
it is a folk song.
arabic?
no, no, it is hungarian.  my daijka sang it to me.
it is beautiful.  what is it about?
it is a long song - szerelem means loveand the story - there is a hungarian count, he is a wanderer, a fool.  for years he is on some kind of quest, who knows what? and then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious english woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave.  he sews her clothes, he worships the hem of -
ouch!  see - you are always beating me..!
you bastard, i was believing you!
this - what is it called? - this place, i love it - this is mine!  I am asking the king permission to call it the almasy bosphorous.
i thought we were against ownership?  i can stay tonight.
madox knows, i think.  he is tried to warn me.  he keeps talking about anna karenina.  i think it is his idea of a man-to-man chat.  its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
this is a different world - is what i tell myself.  a different life. and here i am a different wife.
yes.  a different wife.
i do not care to bargain.  it is full of saffron, just in case you think I am giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
that day, had you followed me to the market?
of course.  you did not need to slap my face to make me feel as if you would slapped my face.
shall we be all right?
yes.  yes.  absolutely.
thought you would never wake up!
what? hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
where did you find that?
i liberated it.
i think that is called looting.
no-one should own music.  the real question is who wrote the song?
irving berlin.
for?
top hat.
is there a song you do not know?
good morning.  did you know that?  you are always singing?
I have been told that before.
kip's another one.
hello.
hello miss.
i was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever you and lieutenant singh
very kind of you, we can always eat in the town with the others -
since caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
I will ask the lieutenant.  but thank you.
you saved my life.  i have not forgotten.  i thought you were very very tall. you seemed to big - a giant - and i felt like a child who can not keep her balance.
a toddler
try this.  i found a great jar of it. olive oil.  in naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
thank you.
for my hair?
yes, for your hair.
brick platform opposite the old ajaib-gher -
- the wonder house comma as the natives called the lahore museum.
it is still there, the cannon, outside the museum. it was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - the natives.
so what do you really object to - the writer or what he is writing about?
what i really object to, uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  and the message everywhere in your book - however slowly i read it - that the best destiny for india is to be ruled by the british.
hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and i.
arguing about books.
condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
I will get another tin. hana and the patient are alone.
i did not like that book either. it is all about men.  too many men. just like this house.
you like him, do not you?  your voice changes.
i do not think it does.  anyway, he is indifferent to me.
i do not think it is indifference.
hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
hey! -
- to her cooking.
this is wonderful!
what is he saying?
and I am telling you there is nothing there to explore.
no, because you can not see from the air! if you could explore from the air life would be very simple!  look!  what is that?  is that a wadi? that whole spur is a real possibility
which we have overflown twice.
which we could not explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it is sloppy.  and here - and here - we could be staring at zerzura.
and where are the expedition maps?
in my room.
those maps belong to his majesty's government.  they are confidential. they should not be left lying around for any tom, dick or mary to have sight of.
what is the matter with you?
do not be so bloody nave.  you know there is a war breaking out.  this arrived this morning.  by order of the british government - all international expeditions to be aborted by may 1939.
why do they care about our maps?
what do we find in the desert? arrow heads, spears.  in a war, if you own the desert, you own north africa.
own the desert.
I would better get back.  say goodbye here.
I am not agreeing.  do not think I am agreeing, because I am not.
i just know - any minute he will find out, we will barge into somebody we will - and it will ill him.
do not go over it again, please.
i just wanted you to know. I am not missing you yet. she nods, can not find this funny.
you will.  you will.
I am still here.
you would better be.
do not depend on it.  will you? that little bit of air, each day there is less of it, which is al right, which is quite all right.
it is okay - I will help.  please.
the mines, the wires, there is a trick. some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
what do i do?
there is a mine here, but the others are far enough away, i think at least to give me a chance.  i have to work out which one to cut before i fall over.
so i follow the wires?
you get hardy.
i follow the wires.
why would anyone do this?
I have done this.  I have had to do this.
what is this business with you and explosives?  do you think you are immune?
i promise you that was the right thing to do.  he is my good luck.  now cut.  this one.  i hope we do not die.
okay.  get away from here.  quick.
I am not scared.  so many people have died around me.  but i would be a shame for us.  i do not feel like being shy.
you must get away.  before i cut. I am not cutting if you are here. he is struggling.  he is going to topple over if he cuts.
actually, you can not cut, can you? you will fall over.  give me the pliers.
no. but he hands them over.
kiss me.  before i cut.  just in case.
do not talk.  check again.  lie flat and then cut.
david caravaggio.
no.
petty thief, six months imprisonment kingston penitentiary, 1937.
i keep explaining.  you have got the wrong man.  my name is bellini - antonio bellini.  bellini, caravaggio, both painters, i think that is confusing you.
is this you?
i do not know.
it is you.  this was taken in cairo at british headquarters - july 41. and so was this - august 41.  and this -february 42.
it is impossible.  i was buying or selling something.  I have been to cairo many times.
you are a canadian spy working for the allies.  code-name moose.
yes, I have been asking for weeks, a month, i do not know, also my leg was -
we do not have a doctor, but we do have a nurse.
a nurse?  well, sure, a nurse is great. a nurse?  great.
why is there so much nose?  i can not hear myself think!  look - give me something.  so we can all get out of this room.  a name.  a code.  it is too hot.
i slept with the girl.  I have got a wife in tripoli.  a girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
well, you must know.  you were brought up libya, yes?
do not cut me.
or was it toronto?
do not cut me.  come on.
go!  hey!  go! caravaggio is in terror.
oh jesus.  oh jesus christ.
i believe I am rather late.
good, we are all here?  a toast, to the international sand club - may it soon resurface.
oops!  must not say international. dirty word.  filthy word.  his majesty! die fhrer!  il duce.
sorry, what is your point?
and the people here do not want us. are you kidding?  the egyptians are desperate to get rid of the colonials  - is not that right? their best people get down on hands and knees begging to be spared a knighthood.  is not that right?
look, either shut up, or go home.
absolutely right, shut up. lashings of apologies all round.
why did you hold his collar?
what?
what?  what?  that boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
would you let me pass?
is he next?  do you drag him into your little room?  where is it?  is this it?
do not do this.
I have watched you - on verandahs, at garden parties, at the races - how can you stand there?  how can you ever smile?  as if your life had not capsized?
you know why? he tries to hold her. she resists
dance with me.
no.
dance with me.  i want to touch you. i want the things which are mine. which belong to me.
do you think you are the only one who feels anything?  is that what you think?
why do not you go?  you should sleep.
would you like me to?
i was looking for the lieutenant singh.
he is sleeping.
only we have to go to work.
I will tell him.  what is it?  is it a mine?
a bomb.  at the viaduct. she closes the door, then reappears.
does he have to go?
pardon me?
what if you could not find him?  sergeant, not today, please. not this morning.
what is happening?  am i needed?
I am afraid so, sir. kip hurries to his tent.  hana follows him.
do not go.  I am frightened.  i can love a coward, i can not love another dead man.
this is what i do.  i do this every day.
you have got to cut, sir, that frost will not last.
go away.
yessir.
this is making me incredibly angry.
kip - come and dance with me
yes.  later.
have a drink.
I have had a drink.  fatal.
well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
very true!
who knows the bosphorus hug?
never heard of it.
that was a dance we invented at the international sand club.
what?  you and madox?  or you and katharine clifton?
what?
i was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the patient, hardy: they are everything that is good about england. i could not even say what that was. we did not exchange two personal words, and we have been together through some terrible things, some -  he was engaged to a girl in the village! - i mean -  and us - he never once he did not ask me if i could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - i do not even know what I am talking about.
you loved him.
if one night i did not come to the tent, what would you do?
i try not to expect you.
but if it got late and i had not shown up?
then I would think there must be a reason.
you would not come to find me?  that makes me never want to come here. but she continues unraveling the turban.
had a letter from my wife.  the wisteria is still out, which I am looking forward to.  she says dorset is gripped with invasion fever.  wrong coast i should have thought, still
right.
bermann thinks he will be interned, poor fellow.  I am going to do what i can, but  and d'ag turns out to be a great admirer of mussolini. so now you can say i told you so.
i told you so.
we did not care about countries. did we?  brits, arabs, hungarians, germans.  none of that mattered, did it?  it was something finer than that.
yes.  it was.  thanks for the compass. I will look after it for you.
when is clifton picking you up?
tomorrow afternoon.  do not worry. I will be ready.
I will leave the plane in the hangar at kufra oasis.  so if you need ithard to know how long one's talking about.  we might all be back in a month or two.
i have to teach myself not to read too much into everything.  comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
goodbye, my friend. they shake hands.
may god make safety your companion.
there is no god.  but i hope someone looks after you.
hana tells me you are leaving.
there are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, do not they know I am allergic to courtrooms?
we shall miss you.
so, i come across the hospital convoy  i was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, mary, hana's friend, tells me about you and hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you would come in from the desert and you were burned and you did not know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then i knew it must be you.
me?
I would seen you writing in that book. at the embassy in cairo, when i had thumbs and you had a face. and a name.
i see.
before you went over to the germans, before you got rommel's spy across the desert and inside british headquarters. he took some pretty good photographs - i saw mine in that torture room in tobruk, so they made an impression.
and you thought you would come and settle the score?
you were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
i had to get back to the desert. i made a promise.  the rest meant nothing to me.
what did you say?
the rest meant nothing to me.
there was a result to what you did. it was not just another expedition.  it did this.  if the british had not unearthed your nosey photographer in cairo thousands of people could have died.
thousands of people did die, just different people.
but you were among the british, they were your friends - why betray them?
is that what you thought?  that i betrayed the british?  the british betrayed me.  the british betrayed me.
katharine!  oh dear god, katharine - what are you doing here?
i can not move.  i can not get out.
why did he bring you?
a surprise, he said.
please do not move me.  it hurts too much.
we have got to get you out of here.
it hurts too much.
i know, darling, I am sorry.
why did you hate me?
what?
do not you know you drove everybody mad?
do not talk.
you speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
you are wearing the thimble.
of course.  you idiot.  i always wear it. I have always worn it.  I have always loved you.
it is so cold.
i know.  I am sorry.  I will make a fire. I will be back.
do not leave me!
I am just going to find things for the fire.
shall we be all right?
yes.  absolutely.
oh dear.
listen to me, katharine.  you have broken your ankle and I am going to have to try and bind it.  i think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it is hurting you to breathe.  I am going to have to walk to el taj.  given all the traffic in the desert these days i should bump into one army or another before i reach there - or fenelon-barnes and his camel.  and then I will be back and we will be fine, and I will never leave you.
do you promise?  i would not want to die here.  i would not want to die in the desert. I have always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns.  very english.  and i know exactly where i want to be buried.  in our garden.  where i grew up. with a view of the sea.  so promise me you will come back for you.
i promise I will come back.  i promise I will never leave you.  and there is plenty of water and food. you can have a party.
and a good read.  do not waste it.
thank you.  will you bury geoffrey?  i know he is dead.
I am sorry, katharine.
i know.
every night i cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again.
tell me about your garden.
our garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and france.  the devil's chimney it was called -  the devil's chimney, i do not know why.  darling.  my darling.
good morning!
could i trouble you for some water?
yes, of course.  so, golly, where have you come from?
i desperately need a jeep.  there is been an accident.
i see.
no, I am not thinking clearly - i need a doctor too, to come with me, can i take this vehicle?  I will pay, of course - and some morphine and  seventy miles - i can be back here by dusk.
do you have your papers, sir?
what?
if i could just see some identification.
am i not talking sense? -  forgive me, i'm, I have been walking, I have - there is a woman badly injured at gilf kebir, in the cave of swimmers.  i am a member of the royal geographical society.
right.  and what is your name, sir?
count laszlo de almsy. the officer is writing this down.  a glance at his corporal.
almsy - would you mind just spelling that for me?  what nationality would that be?
look, listen to me.  a woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here.  i have been walking for three days!  i do not want to spell my name, i want you to give me this jeep!
i understand you are agitated - perhaps you would like to sit down while i radio back to hq -
no!  no!  do not radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!
hey!  hey!  stop this jeep!  let me out of here - there is a woman dying, there is a woman dying while I am - hey!
shut-up!
please - i beg you, i beg you, i beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. just stop, please, and listen to me.  my wife is dying.
listen, fritz, if i have to listen to another word from you I will give you a fucking good hiding.
fritz?  what are you talking about? who is fritz?
that is your name innit?  count fucking arsehole von bismarck? what is that supposed to be then, irish?
what are you up to?
that gun at lahor, kipling's cannon - zamzammah - remember?  that was made out of the metal of ordinary things. i want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. his bayonet is thrust into the forge.  it is red hot.
when i went to england i was amazed at what went on, the waste - I would been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - india could live for a hundred years on what i saw thrown away.
i should go to the house, get breakfast.
the lamp was burning all night in his room.  caravaggio was there with him.
this is hot!
nya-nya-nya!
and did you never see katharine? you never got back to the cave?
yes, i got back there finally to keep my promise.  to come back for her. and then of course i could not i could not even do that properly.
you get to the morning and the poison leaks away, does not it? black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. i thought i would kill you.  you killed my friends, you ruined my hands.  but the girl was always here, like some guardian angel.
you can not kill me.  i died years ago.
no, now i can not kill you.
kip?
i looked up to you, uncle.  my brother always said i was a fool. never trust the british, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
what are you talking about?
what have i been doing all this time? do you know how many mines I have seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we have put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky.  and now this.
well, then ask him his name!
what is happened?  kip!  what is happening? do not shoot, please, do not shoot anybody.
they are excited!  they are happy about destroying a whole city. would they do that to a white man's city?  never!
go on, do it.  i do not need to hear any more.
will you come with me?
of course.  when?
i mean home.  india.
kip i -
i know - here i am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
is that what you think?  is that what you think i think?
it is what I have learned.
I am thinking about your heart, not your skin.  and how to reach it. and that i do not think i can.  a bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb i thought would ruin us.
I have clung to you.  I have clung to you. kip.  life  a raft.
then come with me.
I will always go back to that church. look at my painting.
I will always go back to that church.
so one day we will meet.
buon' giorno.
she can take you as far as florence.
i can get in the back.
