not the usual swiss procedure, mr. bond, but you understand, a man in my position..
which is neutral, no doubt.
i did not get the report from an mi-6 agent.
who did you get it from?
i am just a middle man. i am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner...
and we know how difficult that can be for the swiss.
your last chance. take the money.
your last chance. give me the name.
stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me?
the name?
i cant tell you...  alright, alright! but you must protect me!
constructions not exactly my line.
quite the opposite, in fact.
old friend?
since oxford. i knew him when he had nothing but a brilliant mind and enough guts to conquer the world. hes a man of great integrity.
who buys classified reports for three million pounds.
beautiful, isnt it?
yes.
today, of all days, the sun decides to shine.
perhaps sir robert had a word with the man upstairs.
a word? im sure by now hes engineered a hostile takeover.
you knew him well?
he was my father.
im sorry.
he died before he could complete his lifelong dream.  i intend to finish it for him.
elektra?  running king industries?  ive known that girl all her life. im not sure she knows what shes walking into.
shes not a girl anymore.
ive scheduled a medical for you.
its barely a scratch. the dome broke my fall.
well, at least it turned out to have some purpose.
dislocated collar bone.  if any more tendons snap...  it wont just be two weeks out of action.
i need you to pass me fit now, molly.
its just a scratch.
james.  it wouldnt really be...
then maybe id be... open to that.
perhaps after this ... test?
...yes?...
i could come for a second opinion?
weve been pawns in someones game. they tricked us into bringing the money to king. not just elaborate.  cock-sure.
and expensive.  cost three million plus.
007. what do you know of the caspian sea?
caviar capital of the world. matchless beluga. firm, yet subtle.  largest landlocked body of water on earth.  oil-rich.  hitler wanted it. stalin beat him to it.
and now its up for grabs, a goldrush. far more oil than anyone thought.
who told you to look at elektras files?
i took the initiative.
you havent been given an assignment in this case.
i was the one who brought that money in...
im well aware of your stake in this, 007. if you have a point, get to it.
the amount of money that killed robert king is the same amount as the ransom demand for elektra.
its a message.  he wants us to know hes back.
who?
claude serrault.  a.k.a...
renard.
sir robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. when elektras ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me.  i advised against paying the ransom. i knew it was renard. i played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him.
sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist?
how many deaths is he responsible for? how many innocent people? you may only get one shot at a man like renard. same circumstances, id do the same again.
he survived?
the doctor who saved him couldnt get it out, so renard killed him. when interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. effectively, hes a dead man.
the bullet is moving through the medulla oblongata, killing off his sense of touch. he feels no pain. he can push himself harder, longer than any normal man.
that which does not kill me makes me stronger.
now robert is dead. he got his revenge.
hes not through yet. renard doesnt blow up five million dollars unless he knows theres more coming in. hes working for someone. someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  and they hired the perfect killer. one with a vendetta against king...and you.
get out to the pipeline. find the insider who switched the pin. if your instincts are right, renard will be back. he hasnt completed the job. the pipeline is still going forward, and we have elektra to thank for that.
the worm on the hook again.
i met you at my fathers funeral.
yes.
i havent been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
funerals arent exactly memorable.
god no. all those horrible loved ones and relatives. i dont want to talk to those people. i just want to...talk to my father.  i loved him.  im not sure he knew that.
is that why you want to finish the pipeline?
partially, yes.
who is he?
my bodyguard. he follows me everywhere. hes decisive, vigilant.  and he makes an excellent omelette.
how long has he been with you?
since the kidnapping. why do you ask?
does this look familiar to you?
its my fathers pin. he wore it everyday of his life.
are you trying to break my heart? or is it just your way with women?
its not the pin your father wore. its an exact duplicate. inside is a tiny electrical detonator. we have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
if youve come here to look after me, mr. bond, thank you, but no thank you.  i have two bodyguards, i dont need a third...
the killer doesnt want to see this pipeline continue, doesnt want to see you take over...
thats every man within a five mile radius.  including you.  thats why youre here, isnt it? you think i cant do it. you think im going to screw up. or get myself killed.
i think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. especially kings daughter.
you are wrong, mr. bond. in fact, i am the only person who can do it.
i have to check the upper lines.  gabor will drive you back.
always wanted to see the upper lines.
you dont take no for an answer, do you?
no.
oh my god...were buried alive...
were alright.
i cant stay here.
youre not going to.
no!  it will cave in!
its the only way out...
i cant stay.
i know.
the way i acted, in the snow...you must think im a coward.
i think youre one of the bravest people ive ever met.
what is it?
...you should rest.
james...
i have to go.
then take me with you.
no. youll be safe here.
i dont want to be safe!
i have to go to work.
valentin zukovsky.
bondjamesbond. what brings you here?
you, of course. i need some information.
bond, im a civilian. this is my place. used to be the royal familys, now its mine. i run my little business, i stay out of trouble...
mafia warlords, diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  a nice little rats nest.
have some of the rats nest caviar.  from my own fishery.  they buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my house.
see?  youre upsetting my customers. what do you want?
how does a terrorist like renard supply his men with state-of-the-art russian army weapons?
what?  this is not possible.
if i remember my cyrillic that says 101st airborne division.
where did you get this?
off a high-powered paraski that was trying to kill me.
that too. everyone does what they can to survive.
how high up does this...arms dealing go?
bond. if someone wants you dead, it is renard. our government has nothing to gain by killing you.
but you would have something to gain by killing robert king. and stopping his pipeline.
vodka martini.
two. shaken not stirred.
what the hell are you doing here?
someone wants to kill me, id rather die looking him straight in the eye.  what are you doing here?  looking for a woman a little more your type? how about that one?
if this little show is for my benefit, ill take you home right now.
you had your chance, james. now im looking for a bigger thrill.
i understand its normally good practice to get the feel of the cards before going off the deep end.
really?
surely you believe in living dangerously.
not at that price. time to surrender.
you knew when you first saw me.  you knew it would be like this.
shush.
how did you survive?
i used my body on the guards.  it gave me control. i got to a gun and i took my chance.  ive never told anyone that.
you new?
yes. viktor davidov, miss...?
doctor. jones. christmas jones. no jokes, ive heard them all.
dont know any doctor jokes.
what happened to len tashka?
couldnt make it. splitting headache.
the soldiers may give you a hard time. whatever. if we werent around, theyd have their whole nuclear arsenal lying by the roadsides, rotting in the sun.
i see my friend davidov ran into some difficulty.
indeed.
revenge isnt so hard to fathom. whats clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
who is it?
you think i fear death? i welcome it. i get on my knees and pray for it. you, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no?  shes beautiful isnt she? you should have seen her before. flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed...
you will never touch her. you will never get near her.
have you forgotten who saved your life in geneva?
consider me ungrateful.
its i who should thank you -- for taking that money back to mi-6.  so distressing for m.  an explosion inside her lair.
shell get over it.
you even brought the plane for us.  we really couldnt have done it without you.
he is an impostor.  theres no davidov at miratom.
heres your imposter. hes paid off the men on the plane outside.  theyre not taking the bomb to any russian facility, theyre flying it wherever he tells them.
shame you had to spot i wasnt the real thing.
so who are you?
bond --
they wont get far. every warhead has a locator card.  a miratom device.  emits a high-pitched signal on russian emergency frequencies. we can track the bomb.
with this?
do we have the range of renards plane?
anywhere in this circle.  iran, iraq, pakistan, syria, afghanistan...
marvellous.
ill send someone out.
could...could you come?
whats wrong with you?  are you crazy?
a little. does it matter? after all, whats the point of living if you cant feel alive?  isnt that right, elektra? isnt that your motto?
what are you talking about?
or did you steal it from your old friend renard?
...what?
we had a run-in, he and i. he knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...
are you saying...renard is the man whos trying to kill me?
you can drop the act, its over.
i dont know what youre talking about!
i think you do.
how dare you!  how dare you! that animal!?  that monster!? he disgusts me! you disgust me!  so he knew where to hurt you, is that it? you had a sling on your arm at the funeral! i didnt have to sleep with you to find that out.
he used your exact words.
you knew.  you knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. you used me, you used me as bait. you made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?
im coming with you.
you do what you have to do, but ive called in m.  shes en route from london even now.
the report king bought. its a manual. renards men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead.
then robert was right about a russian connection.
theyre getting their weapons from the russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  i cant help thinking...the person close to king, the one who switched that pin...
the inside man?
is maybe...the inside woman.
the parcels in the post.
its heading for the oil terminal.
where it can do the most damage.
when this is over we should bury the hatchet. celebrate. a champagne dinner?
when this is over our bodies may be blown to smithereens.
alright then, brunch.
the plutonium is missing.  theyve taken the core!
then its no longer a bomb?
its a bomb alright. were still dead if the trigger charge goes off...
perhaps this isnt the time...
please.
what the hell were you doing?  you nearly killed us!
i did kill us. she thinks were dead. and she thinks she got away with it.
what the hell are you talking about?
its part of some plan. she dresses it up like a terrorist attack.  the explosion covers up the theft of the plutonium.
whos she?
elektra king.
elektra king?  are you insane?  this is her pipeline.
makes her look even more innocent.
what would she want with weapons grade plutonium?
i was hoping you could tell me.
what is it?
she just upped the stakes. all her chips are on the table now.  and ms life is part of the bet.
warm.
is it?
your people? your people will leave you here to rot just like you left me. you and my father. he didnt think my life was worth the chump change he spent on a day at the stock market.
your father...
is nothing.  his kingdom he stole from my mother. the kingdom i will rightly take back.
what are doing, bond?  trying to impress this innocent thing?
shes no innocent.  this is my nuclear consultant.
ah, i see.  a purely...plutonic relationship.
really bond, couldnt you find a nice russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
whats your business with elektra king?
i thought you were the one in her business.
she dropped a million and half dollars to the house -- your house. and you didnt even bat an eyelid.  she was paying you off.  what for?
as ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
that is 5,000 dollars of beluga ruined!
you are out of your league.  shes working with renard.
now...where were we?
a rope!
no.  the truth!  she thought i was dead -- those blades were meant for you.  what do you know that she would kill you for?
alright, alright!  sometimes i smuggle machinery for her.  russian stuff.
and the payoff on the tables?
a special job.  a...a...a submarine.
what?
to haul some cargo. my nephew, he is captain of a sub in the black sea fleet.
wheres the sub going?!
no!  get me out!
this is too big for even you.  where is it?
this is a family matter! if my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! now get me out!
no! bond!
bond!
so.  my way.  no mi-6, no interpol.  just you, me and my people.
where?
istanbul.
so beautiful. so smooth, so warm.
how would you know?
why are you like this?  because bond is dead?  its what you wanted.
of course...
he was a...good lover?
what do you think?
what is this place?
former kgb surveillance post. the dye factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit.
in the good old days, the kgb had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. but yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
what class sub does your nephew run?
c-class.
nuclear.
not just nuclear. powered by a nuclear reactor.  hes not loading any cargo. they want the sub. the sub itself. put weapons grade plutonium inside the subs reactor: instant, catastrophic meltdown.
made to look just like an accident.
mother of god.
the right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the bosphorus, cut off the black sea.
but why? eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. a cloud of radiation the size of europe...
because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. there would be only one way to get the oil out of the caspian and pump it to the world...
the king pipeline.
elektra would control it all.
now you know how it feels.  to be locked away, to wonder if theyre coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
someone will come.
who?  bond?  bond is dead.
this is the end.
no.  it is the beginning. the world will never be the same.
the maidens tower.
how appropriate.
id heard there were some renovations there...no one would look for a sub in that place in a million years.
zukovsky...
if i dont get to the boa before he gets to maidens tower, m is dead.
i could have given you the world.
not interested.
wheres m?
soon shell be everywhere.
all this, because you fell for renard?
five more turns and your neck will break.
since i was a child, ive always had a power over men. when i realized my father wouldnt rescue me from the kidnappers, i knew i had to form a new alliance.
you turned renard.
just like you...only you were even easier.
so you killed your father.
he killed me! he killed me the day he refused to pay my ransom.
was this all about the oil?
it is my oil!  mine and my familys!
it runs in my veins, thicker than blood. im going to redraw the map. and when i am through the whole world will know my name, my grandfathers name, the glory of my people.
no-one will believe this melt-down was an accident.
know what happens when a man is strangled?
elektra, its not too late.  eight million people neednt die.
one... last... screw?
oh james.
everythings under control up here.  are you ready?
yes.  au revoir...
is there another way?
we go down to the torpedo bay.
in case youve forgotten.  im dead already.
havent you heard the news?  so is she.
hes sealed himself in.
hes going to insert the plutonium.
do you know what youre doing?
like riding a bike.
what kind of bikes did you ride?
just wanted to put him on edge...
count to twenty.  when you get to twenty open the hatch.  it can only be opened for a few seconds or well sink.
but what if...
count to twenty.  ill be there.
weve got to get out.
we cant.
any word from him?
still no contact yet.
i love christmas in turkey.
so isnt it time you unwrapped your present?
