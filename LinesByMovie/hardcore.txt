you want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
no. thanks anyway. I have got to get over to the office.
anne wants to make sure you come over for dinner sunday. with kristen gone you will be all alone.
is this all the display space we can get?
i tried to get more, but this is the limit. the de vries line has the same area.
what do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, mary.
i like it, mr. van dorn.
do not you think it is a little too... bright?
not really. but if you want me to tone it down...
no, no. i would not hire a display designer if i did not trust her taste. maybe we should bring in more of that shade. perhaps a stripe across the back wall.
no, that would be much too overpowering.
yeah, overpowering. that was the word i was looking for.
mr. van dorn, I have worked on the color scheme for weeks. i think it is just right.
what is that shade of blue called?
pavonine. it is the same tint as the stripe in the fabric.
are you still going with that fella that teaches at grand valley?
sam?
yeah. he is a nice guy. do not lose him. maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. it is a little...
overpowering?
yeah.
okay, mr. van dorn, i think we could knock that pavonine blue a bit.
are you sure it is all right?
yes. i think it will look better.
if you say so.
kristen went on that convention today, did not she?
yeah. how did you know?
you going to knott's berry farm with him?
he asked me. you going with anybody?
i do not know.
you ever play chicken?
what is that?
you never heard of that?
com'on, tell me.
well, a boy goes like this, see.
what does that do?
well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
what is it, jake?
wes, anne, come here a moment.
what happened?
they do not know. they were having some recreation deal out at knott's berry farm and kristen was not there when they got back to the bus and they could not find her.
is marsha there?
yeah. she is quite upset. I am going to fly out today. they want me to bring some pictures.
I will come with you. let me pack some things.
the boy your daughter was talking to did not work at the park. we have interviewed everybody there.
but is she, has...
there is no evidence of any foul play at present. i hope she is just a runaway.
there is something wrong here. kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
i said i hope she is a runaway. better that than she just disappears like so many others do. sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. a lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. these are realities.
what are you doing?
two officers have been assigned to the case. i can not keep them on indefinitely, but we will go through every lead.
those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. that is, you ask them what three and two are they will tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. that is spec-u-lative reasoning, and that is where i come in.
well, what do they know?
dogshit. worse yet, they do not care.
so then, mr. mast...
andy.
...what do you have to offer?
let me ask you a personal question, a painful one. the first of many. tell me, was your daughter the kind of girl to run around, to, ah, play practical jokes, maybe?
no, i did not think she was. let me get the picture here. let me guess. she was an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she did not fuck around...
if i was you, mr. mast, I would watch my language.
hey, I am a private detective, van dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to grand rapids. I have been to that scumbag town. it is full of them.
who is paying you?
you are.
that is right.
as i was saying, I will pick up the thread. there is a number of ways i can go. there is not much you can do here. stay if you want. maybe it would be better if you went back home. go through kristen's personal stuff. ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  look, i do this a lot. i work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. it may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. you could hire cheaper.
and better?
i suppose. but I will tell you, jake, I am like a little animal. when i get my teeth into something i never let go. if your daughter's here, I will track her down.
how is your business, jake?
pretty good.
you should come around more often. you have not been around for weeks. anne complains she does not see you anymore.
hello?
mr. van dorn?
mast?
yeah.
where are you? the connection sounds very good.
I am back in grand rapids.
in g.r.? why?
can you meet me in about an hour? at the pantlind hotel?
I have got a meeting...
what are you paying me for?
I will be there.
this used to be a real city. i was here about fifteen years ago. embezzlement case. it was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. with a downtown and all.
what have you found out?
I have got some news. your daughter's all right. at least i think she is.
where is she?
i do not know.
what do you mean?
have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, jake?
no.
do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
that is like a stag film.
yeah. you ever seen any of those?
no.
they are legal now.
they are?
yeah.  all over. even here in grand rapids.
hmm.
there is a little stall theatre up here.  it is closed now, but I am borrowing it for an hour. i think there is something you would better see.
where is she?
i do not know.
where did you get that film?
i bought it at a store in l.a.
who made it?
i do not know.
what do you mean?
wait. slow down. a film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. it is like it does not even exist.
what is it called?
it was called 'slave of love' when i bought it. next time it is sold, it will be called something else.
but the police...
the police? they know less than you do.
do you think she is safe?
yeah. probably.
you like this, do not you. showing me... this.
i hate it. but you got to know, buddy.  a lot of strange things happen in this world. things you do not know about in grand rapids. things you do not want to know about. doors that should never be opened. I have known more about this sort of thing than a man should. do not ask me why.
hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
you do not have to get uppity with me, bill. i remember when you was running that car wash and could not make it go. and what was that other thing you tried? a dairy queen? went busted too.
at least i improved myself. what is up?
i want you to take a look at this girl here. she is been in some porn stuff.
no, andy. do not know the kid.
look again, billy-boy. this is jail bait. could get you in a lotta trouble.
nope never saw her before.  kurt, come over here. do not use underage kids. would not touch 'em for all the cow shit in mexico.  you recognize this piece of wool, kurt?
i am not cheated you, pilgrim. this is research, damn it! that girl could have told us something.
research, my ass. i suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I have been paying for? and in the middle of the morning, too.
oh, fuck off. you should stay where you belong.
get out. get out of here, goddammit.
I am only human, you know.
get out.
but this is my apartment.
get out!
fifty cents admission.
what?
it is fifty cents admission. it is applicable to a purchase.
do you have a, ah, film called 'slave of love?'
what we got is just these here.  what you see.
it is a short film.
they are all about the same. you want something?
this is from the movie i was talking about.
i do not know what you are talking about.
i wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
that girl? no, never saw her. i do not know anybody.
I am just trying to find...  who owns this store?
i do not know. look, man, if you are looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
but i...
i do not know nothing, man.
you do not want anything for your fifty cents?
no.
here. take your fifty cents back.
that is all right.
no, take it. i do not want your goddamn fifty cents.
hello. my name is beatrice. have you been here before?
no.
what we offer here is nude body to body contact on a bed in a private room. it is twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars an hour. anything else you desire may be discussed in the privacy of your room. tips are allowed. we accept bank americard, master charge and american express.
i do not really want... 'body to body contact.'
that you may discuss with the girl of your choice in the privacy of your room.
no. i do not think so.
you sure? we have regular sessions, too. only twenty dollars?
no.
we offer female wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. tipping is permitted. we accept bank americard, master charge and american express.
yeah.
do you want to take a session?
i just want to ask some questions.
you may do that in the privacy of your room.
okay. I will take a half hour.
do you have any particular choice of girl?
you will be fine.
you are still dressed?
well, i want to...
sit down. make yourself comfortable. my name's felice.
there is a girl i want to ask you about.
you are not vice, are you?  do you work for the los angeles police department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
no, i don't.
i have to ask you that. if you were vice you could not deny it. you ought to dress less square. you would not get hassled so much. here, let me help you get that tie off.
well, actually i wanted to ask about this girl. i have her picture here.
pull out your cock.
what?
cops are not allowed to do that either. a judge ruled that that was entrapment. do not ask me why. i guess he figured the sight of a vice officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
no, felice, I am not a cop. in fact, right now I have got as little respect for the police as you do.  I am looking for a girl. a runaway. i need someone to help me.
are you going to stiff me?
what do you mean?
look, that twenty dollars you just paid, i do not get any of that. that goes to the guys that own this place. i get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. i make all my money on tips.
you want a tip?
sure. what do you want? tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
what do you mean?
what do you want to tip me for? look, you got to spell it out. whatever you want, just say it.
I will give you a tip. here's forty dollars.
now, what do you want?
i said i just wanted to talk to you...
that is cool.
...about this woman.  I am trying to find her. do you know her?
look, i do not know anybody. i never seen her before.
I am getting angry.
wait a minute, that is going to cost you more than forty bucks.
I am getting angry. i want some answers.  where is the guy who runs this place?
who is it? that blond guy? where is he? I am going to talk to someone.
wait?
where is he? where is the bastard that runs this shit hole?
i got a picture here. i want you to tell me where to find this woman. i been asking everybody. nobody knows anything.
calm down, mister. you do not want to get the cops in here do you? you got a family?
i do not suppose you have ever seen this girl before either? her name's kristen, but i suppose you have never seen her?
why do not you just go outdoors, mister? cool off.
cool off, huh? how is this for cooling off?
hold it, mister.
what do you think of that? or this?
no. i walked up. do not ride elevators.
my secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
yes.  I am interested in financing an adult feature film. i was told you were the man to come to.
film making can be pretty expensive...
I have got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
oh.  why is it that you want to get into film financing?
well, bill -- mind if i call you bill?  let me be frank. I have made a lot of money. I have got my own business in detroit. rivets. i make rivets and sell them to fisher body.  well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. when my business manager told me i should shelter some money, i thought I would try this.
what exactly do you have in mind?
i thought I would invest in a film. i want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it is done...
in other words, you want to get laid?
not exactly...
it is cool. why do you think i got in the movies? how much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. you can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. so why fuck with the movie business?
it is an investment.
if you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, i let guys stand around and watch. it is a lot cheaper.
i thought you were a businessman.
do not get me wrong. a couple years ago, i woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. but the lord's been good to me. i can now finance any films i choose. big ones, small ones. right now we are setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. live sound. i like to keep my own money in my films. that way you do not have to share the profits. there is plenty of guys in town that will take it, though. but if i was you, mr... what was your name again?
jake.
...i'd just start my own business. that is what i did. get into kid porn. that is big now. why do not you come around the set? meet some people. if you still want to invest, I will ask around.
sounds all right.
okay. keep in touch with my secretary.
I would like to place a 'personals' ad in the free press.
how many weeks?
just one.
the rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
'film producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
okay.
'film producer seeks young men, 18 to 25, for hardcore film. prior film experience a must. call jake at players motel. 777 vine. 463-5671.
are you the star of this picture?
you kidding? three days work. i finish tonight.
the other girl is the star?
she thinks so.  what do you do?
i work with ramada. we are doing some pictures together.
well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.
jake?
how did you find me?
i called every l.a. hotel. the holiday inn gave this as a referral number. your office said you had no business in new york, so i figured you had come out here.  what is happening, jake? what are you doing? nobody's heard from you. anne's worried sick. we did not know if you were dead or alive.
wes, do me a favor.
what?
leave me alone. go home. go away.
just do what i say. do not ask.
what is going on?
i think I have found a way to find kristen. i have a plan. but i have to be alone.
what plan?
you do not want to know.  now, wes, leave, please. for me.
what will i tell the others? they care about you.
tell them anything you want. tell them I am on a vacation, a business trip. tell them i needed a rest. tell them anything, just do not tell them...
you are not exactly the type we are looking for.
you mean I am black?
no, just not the type.
what do you mean, not the type? do not you know who i am? I am big dick brown! I have been in more porno movies than you ever saw. I have worked with harry reems. I have worked with johnny wad. not the type! i can come ten times a day. i can keep it hard two hours at a time. my cock is nine inches long.
I am sorry, mr. brown. I am sure you are very good, but at the moment, I have got nothing for you. if something comes up, we will give you a call.
shit! you just do not want to hire a nigger, that is all. i knew this was a scam. i shouldn'ta come.
hey man.
we are casting for an explicit sex action feature...
i know. word's out on the street -- word's also out you am not really hiring anyone.
that is not true, mr...?
jim sullivan. sometimes they call me jism jim.
that is not true, jim. in fact, i think you are very close to the type we are looking for.
oh yeah? I have done a lot of good stuff. shorts, features. no major roles it is true. but good stuff.
that is what i wanted to talk to you about.
oh yeah? i remember that. it was made by some college kids.
it was called 'slave of love.'
god, i do not know what it was called. i never saw it. i only got twenty- five bucks for the whole goddamned thing.
i thought you were quite good in it. i also like the girl in it. really thought she was good.  i wondered if she was still around. if she was still working.
hey, stop, stop. I will do anything you want. it is okay. i can dig it. you can do anything you want to me.
where is she? where is the girl?
she is got a man. a white guy. tod something or other.
where does he hang out?
i do not know.
where!
look, i know this chick niki. she works at les girls. she would know. honest.
are you niki?
sure. like in mikey and niki. did you see that picture?
no.
too bad. i was not in it.
it is your money. you talk.
I am making a film. jim sullivan's going to be in it. he said you might know where tod is.
do i know you? were not you on the set the other night? with ramada.
yeah.
you making a feature?
um-hm. live sound.
got any parts? I am free. not free- free, but, you know, free. i do not really do this.
joanne?
you know her?
no. i saw her with tod.
do you know where she lives?
nah.
do you know where she would be?
where is she?
tod might know.
where is he?
last i heard he went to san diego.
if we went there, would you be able to find him?
you are not a film producer, are you?
how much do you make a week, niki?
are you a private detective?
something like that. how much do you make?
here? what a joke. there was some detective asking about that girl.
three hundred?
this is just temporary. i once made nine hundred in outcall.
I will give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
up front?
half now, half later.
make it nine hundred. that was my best week.
okay. my client pays for it anyway.
when do we start?
tonight. when you get out, we will go.  why did not you tell the other detective?
this is different. this is nine hundred dollars.
ssh. I am on a stakeout.
oh.
I am staking out this beer bottle. trying to find out if I will finish it or it will finish me.
I am worried about jake.
I am off that case. he fired me.
he did not look good at all. something strange is going on. he is got himself into some trouble. he would not say what.
I will tell you, that was an interesting case. the van dorn girl. I have handled runaway cases like it before. usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid, she pops up in about a week. everybody denies ever seeing her, but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home. well, i put pressure on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice. in fact, certain people for this girl and -- nothing.  i guess i gave your brother-in-law sort of a raw deal.
i want to rehire you. to find out what is happening to my brother-in- law.
I have been on another case. all day.  i suppose i can move it over. seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
do you really think kristen is just a runaway?
maybe. maybe not.
i also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
huh?
you have to understand. he can be mean, self-righteous. he had a vishund once. loved that dog. he came home one day and the dog bit him. he took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. it was winter. every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. he is capable of doing anything.
to his own daughter?
to anybody.
i thought you were going to bed?
i am.
no.
huh?
niki. calm down. relax. let's just talk for a while. then, later, you will go back to your room and we will get some sleep.
you have anything to drink? you want to go out and get something?
i do not drink, but you can go out.
you do not drink?
ulcers.
you are not a private detective either, are you?
no.
i did not think so. I have fucked detectives. who are you?
a friend.
of joanne's?
yeah.  I am her father.
jesus.
her name is kristen. she disappeared a couple of months ago.
and your wife? where is she?
she is dead.
hey, do not worry about it. your daughter's around. we will find her in a couple days.
you really should not eat like that. all that sugar. it is not good for you.
at least I am a growing person.
you will not keep growing at this rate.
what rate?
you know what I am talking about.
you never met a working girl before, have you? you think i like sucking off guys all night? maybe i do. so what?  you can not even say it, can you?
say what?
'sucking off.'
okay. sucking off. now does that make me as good as you?
you do not understand shit.
okay, tell me. why do you live like you do?
did you ever live in a room with six people and you did not have any money, any food, any furniture? have your brother come out, his car break down, he can not get a job? your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
is that the way it was with you?
no. but does it make any difference?  how did you get to be the way you are?
do not knock it. a girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. then you are free. you can go off to europe, meet somebody, get married. my girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. not me. I am going to travel. 'keep movin' that is my motto.  would you rather work at copper penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? i can make more money suc... doing what i do for five minutes than i can all week at another job.
you used to work at copper penny?
no.
you and i, niki, have very different ideas about sex.
why? are you a sex fiend?
no.
neither am i.
but it is all you do.
how important do you think sex is?
not very.
we are just alike. you think sex is so unimportant you do not do it. i think sex is so unimportant i do not care who i do it with.
i do not see why i must justify myself to you. i do not care about the things you do. i do not care what is happening in new york or los angeles. i do not care about movies or tv. i do not care who is on johnny carson.
what do you care about?
i care about my daughter.
you remember me. louise? rhymes with squeeze.
you working in san diego now?
I am still in l.a., but I am looking for tod. i heard he was around.
'was.' he and that shitheel ratan went down to t-j. maybe i should not say that. anyway, i hear he is back in frisco now.
was he with a girl?
no.
thanks.
what is t-j?
tijuana.
they were here?
tod was.  he was with ratan.
what does that mean?  what does he do?
he deals in pain.
is kristen safe?
apparently your friend has gone into mexico. a border guard responded to the apb. how does it feel to have the l.a.p.d. doing your work for you?
you are going to thank me for this. you know what the media's like. they love this kinda shit. if that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you are going to have so much bad publicity, you...
i heard you the first time. we had nothing to go on with this kid. just a runaway.  do you really think he is in danger?
if he has anything to say about it, yeah. I have been asking a lot of questions and i do not like the answers I am getting. he is made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
we are not going to arrest him for that...
big threat. tv would ream you.
keep me informed of what he is up to. you help me, I will help you.
you have to believe in something. what do they believe in -- the whatjamacillit church?
christian reformed. it is a dutch calvinist denomination.
do they believe in reincarnation? i believe in reincarnation.
they believe in the 'tulip.'
what the crap?
it is an anagram. it comes from the canons of dort. every letter stands for a different belief. t-u-l-i-p. like -- are you sure you are interested in this?
yeah, yeah, go on.
t stands for total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'all my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the lord.'
shit.
be that as it may. u is for unconditional election. god has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, the elect, and he has chosen them from the beginning of time. l is for limited atonement. only a limited number will be atoned, will go to heaven.
fuck.
i can stop if you want.
no, please go on.
i is for irresistible grace. god's grace cannot be resisted or denied. and p is for the perseverance of the saints. once you are in grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. and that is the 'tulip.'
wait, wait. I am trying to figure this out. this is like rona barrett. before you become saved, god already knows who you are?
he has to. that is predestination. if god is omniscient, if he knows everything -- and he would not be god if he did not -- then he must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
so it is already worked out. the fix is in?
more or less.
wow. then why be good? either you are saved or you ain't.
out of gratitude for being chosen. that is where grace comes in. god first chooses you, then allows you, by grace, to choose him of your own free will.
you really believe all that?
yeah.  well, mostly.
i thought i was fucked up.
I will admit it is confusing from the outside. you have got to see it from the inside.
if you see anything from the inside it makes sense. you ought to hear perverts talk. a guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
it is not quite the same thing.
it does not make any sense to me.
tod'll meet you at the bookstore at eddy and o'farrell tomorrow noon. i told him you were a 'specialty' customer.
why can not i meet him now?
rot in hell, honey.  he is busy now.
where does he live.
just a second. it is my ass I am risking. you better do it my way. these fuckers do not mess around.
i must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life. at least it feels that way.
i know what you mean. after a while they all look the same.
they are the same.
do you live in a house back in wherever.
grand rapids? of course.
on your own land?
look, i really do not know your daughter but...
but what?
i would not expect too much. i mean about her coming back. once a girl gets into the life.
what makes you so sure?
you wife is not dead is she?
why do you say that?
just a guess. she am not dead though is she?
she left you right?
yeah.  she was the one called joanne. how did you find that out?
just a guess. did you have it good with your wife? you know, sex.
i do not blame you, niki. really i don't. it is this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, tv. it is destroying everything. buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. kids think it is normal. they think they are supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
do not get upset. i lied too. i do not make no five hundred dollars a week. everything i make goes to granville.
granville?
my man. 'pimp.' i split 'cause he do not treat me for shit. thinks he is so cool 'cause he is black. i once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'you can not take 'em 'cause they are my clothes -- i bought 'em.' yeah, with my fucking money...
look, niki, this really is not my business. i do not know anything about...
so i guess we are both fucked, huh? but at least you get to go to heaven. i do not get shit.
what are you doing here?
i felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what i did to you -- not that i did anything wrong -- that i kept investigating, poking around. there is some poor s.o.b. in l.a. with his face all bent out of shape who you have damaged his movie career. lucky for him, people do not look at his face.
do the police want to arrest me?
nah. they do not care about some faggot hustler. they are more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. like i am.
yeah, sure.
listen, pilgrim, you are way out on a limb here. you do not know what you are into.
you sure as hell have not been any help.
I am sorry about that. have you found anything out? you have got to tell me.
why do not you tell me something for a change?
like what?
who is ratan?
