you want to go for coffee after we send the girls off?
no. thanks anyway. i've got to get over to the office.
anne wants to make sure you come over for dinner sunday. with kristen gone you'll be all alone.
is this all the display space we can get?
i tried to get more, but this is the limit. the de vries line has the same area.
what do you think of this... ah, shade of blue, mary.
i like it, mr. van dorn.
don't you think it's a little too... bright?
not really. but if you want me to tone it down...
no, no. i wouldn't hire a display designer if i didn't trust her taste. maybe we should bring in more of that shade. perhaps a stripe across the back wall.
no, that would be much too overpowering.
yeah, overpowering. that was the word i was looking for.
mr. van dorn, i've worked on the color scheme for weeks. i think it's just right.
what's that shade of blue called?
pavonine. it's the same tint as the stripe in the fabric.
are you still going with that fella that teaches at grand valley?
sam?
yeah. he's a nice guy. don't lose him. maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. it's a little...
overpowering?
yeah.
okay, mr. van dorn, i think we could knock that pavonine blue a bit.
are you sure it's all right?
yes. i think it'll look better.
if you say so.
kristen went on that convention today, didn't she?
yeah. how did you know?
you going to knott's berry farm with him?
he asked me. you going with anybody?
i don't know.
you ever play chicken?
what's that?
you never heard of that?
com'on, tell me.
well, a boy goes like this, see.
what does that do?
well, each time he comes in closer, like this.
what is it, jake?
wes, anne, come here a moment.
what happened?
they don't know. they were having some recreation deal out at knott's berry farm and kristen wasn't there when they got back to the bus and they couldn't find her.
is marsha there?
yeah. she's quite upset. i'm going to fly out today. they want me to bring some pictures.
i'll come with you. let me pack some things.
the boy your daughter was talking to didn't work at the park. we've interviewed everybody there.
but is she, has...
there's no evidence of any foul play at present. i hope she's just a runaway.
there's something wrong here. kristen is not the type of girl to just up and leave.
i said i hope she's a runaway. better that than she just disappears like so many others do. sometimes they turn up years later, sometimes not. a lot of crimes go unreported, unknown. these are realities.
what are you doing?
two officers have been assigned to the case. i can't keep them on indefinitely, but we'll go through every lead.
those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. that is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. that's spec-u-lative reasoning, and that's where i come in.
well, what do they know?
dogshit. worse yet, they don't care.
so then, mr. mast...
andy.
...what do you have to offer?
let me ask you a personal question, a painful one. the first of many. tell me, was your daughter the kind of girl to run around, to, ah, play practical jokes, maybe?
no, i didn't think she was. let me get the picture here. let me guess. she was an absolutely clean girl, a model daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she didn't fuck around...
if i was you, mr. mast, i'd watch my language.
hey, i'm a private detective, van dorn, you want to hire a choir boy you can go back to grand rapids. i've been to that scumbag town. it's full of them.
who's paying you?
you are.
that's right.
as i was saying, i'll pick up the thread. there's a number of ways i can go. there's not much you can do here. stay if you want. maybe it'd be better if you went back home. go through kristen's personal stuff. ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.  look, i do this a lot. i work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. it may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain't. you could hire cheaper.
and better?
i suppose. but i'll tell you, jake, i'm like a little animal. when i get my teeth into something i never let go. if your daughter's here, i'll track her down.
how's your business, jake?
pretty good.
you should come around more often. you haven't been around for weeks. anne complains she doesn't see you anymore.
hello?
mr. van dorn?
mast?
yeah.
where are you? the connection sounds very good.
i'm back in grand rapids.
in g.r.? why?
can you meet me in about an hour? at the pantlind hotel?
i've got a meeting...
what are you paying me for?
i'll be there.
this used to be a real city. i was here about fifteen years ago. embezzlement case. it was always a little religious for my taste, but at least it was a city. with a downtown and all.
what have you found out?
i've got some news. your daughter's all right. at least i think she is.
where is she?
i don't know.
what do you mean?
have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic movies, jake?
no.
do you know what a "hardcore" movie is?
that's like a stag film.
yeah. you ever seen any of those?
no.
they're legal now.
they are?
yeah.  all over. even here in grand rapids.
hmm.
there's a little stall theatre up here.  it's closed now, but i'm borrowing it for an hour. i think there's something you'd better see.
where is she?
i don't know.
where did you get that film?
i bought it at a store in l.a.
who made it?
i don't know.
what do you mean?
wait. slow down. a film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. it's like it doesn't even exist.
what's it called?
it was called 'slave of love' when i bought it. next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
but the police...
the police? they know less than you do.
do you think she's safe?
yeah. probably.
you like this, don't you. showing me... this.
i hate it. but you gotta know, buddy.  a lot of strange things happen in this world. things you don't know about in grand rapids. things you don't want to know about. doors that should never be opened. i've known more about this sort of thing than a man should. don't ask me why.
hey, piss-head, what brings you around?
you don't have to get uppity with me, bill. i remember when you was running that car wash and couldn't make it go. and what was that other thing you tried? a dairy queen? went busted too.
at least i improved myself. what's up?
i want you to take a look at this girl here. she's been in some porn stuff.
no, andy. don't know the kid.
look again, billy-boy. this is jail bait. could get you in a lotta trouble.
nope never saw her before.  kurt, come over here. don't use underage kids. wouldn't touch 'em for all the cow shit in mexico.  you recognize this piece of wool, kurt?
i ain't cheated you, pilgrim. this is research, damn it! that girl could have told us something.
research, my ass. i suppose these are the 'extra expenses' i've been paying for? and in the middle of the morning, too.
oh, fuck off. you should stay where you belong.
get out. get out of here, goddammit.
i'm only human, you know.
get out.
but this is my apartment.
get out!
fifty cents admission.
what?
it's fifty cents admission. it's applicable to a purchase.
do you have a, ah, film called 'slave of love?'
what we got is just these here.  what you see.
it's a short film.
they're all about the same. you want something?
this is from the movie i was talking about.
i don't know what you're talking about.
i wondered if you had ever seen this film or this woman...  ...right here.
that girl? no, never saw her. i don't know anybody.
i'm just trying to find...  who owns this store?
i don't know. look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
but i...
i don't know nothing, man.
you don't want anything for your fifty cents?
no.
here. take your fifty cents back.
that's all right.
no, take it. i don't want your goddamn fifty cents.
hello. my name is beatrice. have you been here before?
no.
what we offer here is nude body to body contact on a bed in a private room. it's twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars an hour. anything else you desire may be discussed in the privacy of your room. tips are allowed. we accept bank americard, master charge and american express.
i don't really want... 'body to body contact.'
that you may discuss with the girl of your choice in the privacy of your room.
no. i don't think so.
you sure? we have regular sessions, too. only twenty dollars?
no.
we offer female wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. tipping is permitted. we accept bank americard, master charge and american express.
yeah.
do you want to take a session?
i just want to ask some questions.
you may do that in the privacy of your room.
okay. i'll take a half hour.
do you have any particular choice of girl?
you'll be fine.
you're still dressed?
well, i want to...
sit down. make yourself comfortable. my name's felice.
there's a girl i want to ask you about.
you're not vice, are you?  do you work for the los angeles police department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
no, i don't.
i have to ask you that. if you were vice you couldn't deny it. you ought to dress less square. you wouldn't get hassled so much. here, let me help you get that tie off.
well, actually i wanted to ask about this girl. i have her picture here.
pull out your cock.
what?
cops aren't allowed to do that either. a judge ruled that that was entrapment. don't ask me why. i guess he figured the sight of a vice officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
no, felice, i'm not a cop. in fact, right now i've got as little respect for the police as you do.  i'm looking for a girl. a runaway. i need someone to help me.
are you going to stiff me?
what do you mean?
look, that twenty dollars you just paid, i don't get any of that. that goes to the guys that own this place. i get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. i make all my money on tips.
you want a tip?
sure. what do you want? tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
what do you mean?
what do you want to tip me for? look, you got to spell it out. whatever you want, just say it.
i'll give you a tip. here's forty dollars.
now, what do you want?
i said i just wanted to talk to you...
that's cool.
...about this woman.  i'm trying to find her. do you know her?
look, i don't know anybody. i never seen her before.
i'm getting angry.
wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
i'm getting angry. i want some answers.  where's the guy who runs this place?
who is it? that blond guy? where is he? i'm going to talk to someone.
wait?
where is he? where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?
i got a picture here. i want you to tell me where to find this woman. i been asking everybody. nobody knows anything.
calm down, mister. you don't want to get the cops in here do you? you got a family?
i don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? her name's kristen, but i suppose you've never seen her?
why don't you just go outdoors, mister? cool off.
cool off, huh? how's this for cooling off?
hold it, mister.
what do you think of that? or this?
no. i walked up. don't ride elevators.
my secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
yes.  i'm interested in financing an adult feature film. i was told you were the man to come to.
film making can be pretty expensive...
i've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
oh.  why is it that you want to get into film financing?
well, bill -- mind if i call you bill?  let me be frank. i've made a lot of money. i've got my own business in detroit. rivets. i make rivets and sell them to fisher body.  well, rivets, you know, can get pretty boring after a while. when my business manager told me i should shelter some money, i thought i'd try this.
what exactly do you have in mind?
i thought i'd invest in a film. i want to sort of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who make films, learn how it's done...
in other words, you want to get laid?
not exactly...
it's cool. why do you think i got in the movies? how much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. you can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. so why fuck with the movie business?
it's an investment.
if you want to watch when we shoot a film, for fifty bucks, i let guys stand around and watch. it's a lot cheaper.
i thought you were a businessman.
don't get me wrong. a couple years ago, i woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. but the lord's been good to me. i can now finance any films i choose. big ones, small ones. right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. live sound. i like to keep my own money in my films. that way you don't have to share the profits. there's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. but if i was you, mr... what was your name again?
jake.
...i'd just start my own business. that's what i did. get into kid porn. that's big now. why don't you come around the set? meet some people. if you still want to invest, i'll ask around.
sounds all right.
okay. keep in touch with my secretary.
i'd like to place a 'personals' ad in the free press.
how many weeks?
just one.
the rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
'film producer' -- that should be in caps, bold face.
okay.
'film producer seeks young men, 18 to 25, for hardcore film. prior film experience a must. call jake at players motel. 777 vine. 463-5671.
are you the star of this picture?
you kidding? three days work. i finish tonight.
the other girl is the star?
she thinks so.  what do you do?
i work with ramada. we're doing some pictures together.
well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.
jake?
how did you find me?
i called every l.a. hotel. the holiday inn gave this as a referral number. your office said you had no business in new york, so i figured you had come out here.  what's happening, jake? what are you doing? nobody's heard from you. anne's worried sick. we didn't know if you were dead or alive.
wes, do me a favor.
what?
leave me alone. go home. go away.
just do what i say. don't ask.
what is going on?
i think i've found a way to find kristen. i have a plan. but i have to be alone.
what plan?
you don't want to know.  now, wes, leave, please. for me.
what will i tell the others? they care about you.
tell them anything you want. tell them i'm on a vacation, a business trip. tell them i needed a rest. tell them anything, just don't tell them...
you're not exactly the type we're looking for.
you mean i'm black?
no, just not the type.
what do you mean, not the type? don't you know who i am? i'm big dick brown! i've been in more porno movies than you ever saw. i've worked with harry reems. i've worked with johnny wad. not the type! i can come ten times a day. i can keep it hard two hours at a time. my cock is nine inches long.
i'm sorry, mr. brown. i'm sure you're very good, but at the moment, i've got nothing for you. if something comes up, we'll give you a call.
shit! you just don't want to hire a nigger, that's all. i knew this was a scam. i shouldn'ta come.
hey man.
we're casting for an explicit sex action feature...
i know. word's out on the street -- word's also out you ain't really hiring anyone.
that's not true, mr...?
jim sullivan. sometimes they call me jism jim.
that's not true, jim. in fact, i think you're very close to the type we're looking for.
oh yeah? i've done a lot of good stuff. shorts, features. no major roles it's true. but good stuff.
that's what i wanted to talk to you about.
oh yeah? i remember that. it was made by some college kids.
it was called 'slave of love.'
god, i don't know what it was called. i never saw it. i only got twenty- five bucks for the whole goddamned thing.
i thought you were quite good in it. i also like the girl in it. really thought she was good.  i wondered if she was still around. if she was still working.
hey, stop, stop. i'll do anything you want. it's okay. i can dig it. you can do anything you want to me.
where is she? where is the girl?
she's got a man. a white guy. tod something or other.
where does he hang out?
i don't know.
where!
look, i know this chick niki. she works at les girls. she would know. honest.
are you niki?
sure. like in mikey and niki. did you see that picture?
no.
too bad. i wasn't in it.
it's your money. you talk.
i'm making a film. jim sullivan's going to be in it. he said you might know where tod is.
do i know you? weren't you on the set the other night? with ramada.
yeah.
you making a feature?
um-hm. live sound.
got any parts? i'm free. not free- free, but, you know, free. i don't really do this.
joanne?
you know her?
no. i saw her with tod.
do you know where she lives?
nah.
do you know where she would be?
where is she?
tod might know.
where's he?
last i heard he went to san diego.
if we went there, would you be able to find him?
you're not a film producer, are you?
how much do you make a week, niki?
are you a private detective?
something like that. how much do you make?
here? what a joke. there was some detective asking about that girl.
three hundred?
this is just temporary. i once made nine hundred in outcall.
i'll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help me find this girl.
up front?
half now, half later.
make it nine hundred. that was my best week.
okay. my client pays for it anyway.
when do we start?
tonight. when you get out, we'll go.  why didn't you tell the other detective?
this is different. this is nine hundred dollars.
ssh. i'm on a stakeout.
oh.
i'm staking out this beer bottle. trying to find out if i'll finish it or it'll finish me.
i'm worried about jake.
i'm off that case. he fired me.
he didn't look good at all. something strange is going on. he's got himself into some trouble. he wouldn't say what.
i'll tell you, that was an interesting case. the van dorn girl. i've handled runaway cases like it before. usually when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid, she pops up in about a week. everybody denies ever seeing her, but there she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home. well, i put pressure on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice. in fact, certain people for this girl and -- nothing.  i guess i gave your brother-in-law sort of a raw deal.
i want to rehire you. to find out what's happening to my brother-in- law.
i've been on another case. all day.  i suppose i can move it over. seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.
do you really think kristen is just a runaway?
maybe. maybe not.
i also want you to protect my brother- in-law.
huh?
you have to understand. he can be mean, self-righteous. he had a vishund once. loved that dog. he came home one day and the dog bit him. he took that dog and staked him out in the back yard. it was winter. every day he came home and watched that dog until he froze. he's capable of doing anything.
to his own daughter?
to anybody.
i thought you were going to bed?
i am.
no.
huh?
niki. calm down. relax. let's just talk for a while. then, later, you'll go back to your room and we'll get some sleep.
you have anything to drink? you want to go out and get something?
i don't drink, but you can go out.
you don't drink?
ulcers.
you're not a private detective either, are you?
no.
i didn't think so. i've fucked detectives. who are you?
a friend.
of joanne's?
yeah.  i'm her father.
jesus.
her name is kristen. she disappeared a couple of months ago.
and your wife? where's she?
she's dead.
hey, don't worry about it. your daughter's around. we'll find her in a couple days.
you really shouldn't eat like that. all that sugar. it's not good for you.
at least i'm a growing person.
you won't keep growing at this rate.
what rate?
you know what i'm talking about.
you never met a working girl before, have you? you think i like sucking off guys all night? maybe i do. so what?  you can't even say it, can you?
say what?
'sucking off.'
okay. sucking off. now does that make me as good as you?
you don't understand shit.
okay, tell me. why do you live like you do?
did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
is that the way it was with you?
no. but does it make any difference?  how did you get to be the way you are?
don't knock it. a girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. then you're free. you can go off to europe, meet somebody, get married. my girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. not me. i'm gonna travel. 'keep movin' that's my motto.  would you rather work at copper penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? i can make more money suc... doing what i do for five minutes than i can all week at another job.
you used to work at copper penny?
no.
you and i, niki, have very different ideas about sex.
why? are you a sex fiend?
no.
neither am i.
but it's all you do.
how important do you think sex is?
not very.
we're just alike. you think sex is so unimportant you don't do it. i think sex is so unimportant i don't care who i do it with.
i don't see why i must justify myself to you. i don't care about the things you do. i don't care what's happening in new york or los angeles. i don't care about movies or tv. i don't care who's on johnny carson.
what do you care about?
i care about my daughter.
you remember me. louise? rhymes with squeeze.
you working in san diego now?
i'm still in l.a., but i'm looking for tod. i heard he was around.
'was.' he and that shitheel ratan went down to t-j. maybe i shouldn't say that. anyway, i hear he's back in frisco now.
was he with a girl?
no.
thanks.
what's t-j?
tijuana.
they were here?
tod was.  he was with ratan.
what does that mean?  what does he do?
he deals in pain.
is kristen safe?
apparently your friend has gone into mexico. a border guard responded to the apb. how does it feel to have the l.a.p.d. doing your work for you?
you're going to thank me for this. you know what the media's like. they love this kinda shit. if that guy goes off half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you're going to have so much bad publicity, you...
i heard you the first time. we had nothing to go on with this kid. just a runaway.  do you really think he's in danger?
if he has anything to say about it, yeah. i've been asking a lot of questions and i don't like the answers i'm getting. he's made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who thought he was going to be a movie star.
we aren't gonna arrest him for that...
big threat. tv would ream you.
keep me informed of what he's up to. you help me, i'll help you.
you have to believe in something. what do they believe in -- the whatjamacillit church?
christian reformed. it's a dutch calvinist denomination.
do they believe in reincarnation? i believe in reincarnation.
they believe in the 'tulip.'
what the crap?
it's an anagram. it comes from the canons of dort. every letter stands for a different belief. t-u-l-i-p. like -- are you sure you're interested in this?
yeah, yeah, go on.
t stands for total depravity, that is, all men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. 'all my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the lord.'
shit.
be that as it may. u is for unconditional election. god has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, the elect, and he has chosen them from the beginning of time. l is for limited atonement. only a limited number will be atoned, will go to heaven.
fuck.
i can stop if you want.
no, please go on.
i is for irresistible grace. god's grace cannot be resisted or denied. and p is for the perseverance of the saints. once you are in grace you cannot fall from the number of the elect. and that's the 'tulip.'
wait, wait. i'm trying to figure this out. this is like rona barrett. before you become saved, god already knows who you are?
he has to. that's predestination. if god is omniscient, if he knows everything -- and he wouldn't be god if he didn't -- then he must have known, even before the creation of the world, the names of those who would be saved.
so it's already worked out. the fix is in?
more or less.
wow. then why be good? either you're saved or you ain't.
out of gratitude for being chosen. that's where grace comes in. god first chooses you, then allows you, by grace, to choose him of your own free will.
you really believe all that?
yeah.  well, mostly.
i thought i was fucked up.
i'll admit it's confusing from the outside. you've got to see it from the inside.
if you see anything from the inside it makes sense. you ought to hear perverts talk. a guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
it's not quite the same thing.
it doesn't make any sense to me.
tod'll meet you at the bookstore at eddy and o'farrell tomorrow noon. i told him you were a 'specialty' customer.
why can't i meet him now?
rot in hell, honey.  he's busy now.
where does he live.
just a second. it's my ass i'm risking. you better do it my way. these fuckers don't mess around.
i must have been in more motel rooms this week than in the rest of my life. at least it feels that way.
i know what you mean. after a while they all look the same.
they are the same.
do you live in a house back in wherever.
grand rapids? of course.
on your own land?
look, i really don't know your daughter but...
but what?
i wouldn't expect too much. i mean about her coming back. once a girl gets into the life.
what makes you so sure?
you wife isn't dead is she?
why do you say that?
just a guess. she ain't dead though is she?
she left you right?
yeah.  she was the one called joanne. how'd you find that out?
just a guess. did you have it good with your wife? you know, sex.
i don't blame you, niki. really i don't. it's this culture, where everything's based on sex, sold on sex...  ...magazines, music, tv. it's destroying everything. buy this 'cause of sex, use this 'cause of sex. kids think it's normal. they think they're supposed to talk dirty, wear scanty clothes...
don't get upset. i lied too. i don't make no five hundred dollars a week. everything i make goes to granville.
granville?
my man. 'pimp.' i split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. i once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'you can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- i bought 'em.' yeah, with my fucking money...
look, niki, this really isn't my business. i don't know anything about...
so i guess we're both fucked, huh? but at least you get to go to heaven. i don't get shit.
what are you doing here?
i felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what i did to you -- not that i did anything wrong -- that i kept investigating, poking around. there's some poor s.o.b. in l.a. with his face all bent out of shape who you've damaged his movie career. lucky for him, people don't look at his face.
do the police want to arrest me?
nah. they don't care about some faggot hustler. they're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. like i am.
yeah, sure.
listen, pilgrim, you're way out on a limb here. you don't know what you're into.
you sure as hell haven't been any help.
i'm sorry about that. have you found anything out? you've got to tell me.
why don't you tell me something for a change?
like what?
who is ratan?
where'd you hear that name?
i just heard. who is he?
you know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. you can buy child whores, slaves. you can have people raped, killed...  one of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named ratan. he usually isn't in this country.  how'd you hear about him?
it's just a name.
don't do anything more. i'll find out what i can.
does she know anything about this?
who? the whore? no. she's just a victim. a dime a dozen.
i hear you got money to spend.  i hear you're interested in... interesting things.
yeah.
do you work for the san francisco police department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
no.
what you got in mind?
i want to meet ratan.
what is that? a kind of chair? i never heard of no ratan.
i was told that there were certain things that only ratan could provide.
you're talking about real excitement?
yeah. i heard you and ratan just came from mexico. and that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know...
who told you about this?
rucker.
i don't know no ratan, but i may be able to help you out. it's not me, of course. just helping out a friend. it'll cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.
is this with a girl named kristen?
um-hm. you got the five hundred?
well...
take it or leave it.
okay.
meet me here today at seven o'clock. with the money. then we'll go see the film.
good.
you know granville's looking for you, niki?
my name ain't niki. it's pattica, like in attica.
granville's looking for you anyway.
who's that?
the guy who bought you that ring.
well, he can just fuck himself.
you can fuck off, too.
you're taking a big chance.
i ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
oh no? what you gonna do? get a job?
jake'll take care of me.
who? van dorn? you must be kidding yourself, honey. you think once that guy finds his daughter he'll care about you?
what happened, pilgrim?
just leave me alone.
but i'm here to help you...
did you find out where she was?
tod gave me the slip. i have to find him again. where does he live?
what happened?
where is he?
i can't tell you that.
listen, niki. my daughter's been missing five months. i've gone through a lot to find out what's happened to her. i just saw a girl killed. i will not let tod slip out of my hands. you have to tell me where he is.
but then you'll forget about me.
where is he, niki?
hello. you want some information?
yeah.
we offer...
yeah, yeah...
...the disciplines: bondage, domination and humiliation.
i'm looking for tod. is he in?
i don't know no tod.
what girls you got here?
my name is hope. this is faith.  charity's in back.
that's all you got, three girls?
man, how many girls do you need?
i was told there was a real nice girl here named joanne. quite young.
that's charity. she's out back. she'll be free in half hour.
what do you want?  do i know you from somewhere?
i want to know where my daughter is. her name is kristen, or joanne. she's with you.
i don't know what you're talking about.
you wait here. i'll find out where she is.
you ain't goin' nowhere alone.
where's ratan?
who?
that film was a fake! everything's phony...
ratan!
who the fuck knows? the four aces. he goes there.
let's go.
andy, can you do something for her? maybe money...
go home, pilgrim. there's nothing you can do. forget this place. start over.
