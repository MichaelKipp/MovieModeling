dr. niko topopolosis?
it's tatopoulos.
right. the worm guy.  can someone get those people off the beach?
excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell i'm doing here?
follow me.
you didn't answer my question. in fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
we have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
look, i may work for the nuclear regulatory commission but accidents and spills are not my field.
we know.
do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the chernobyl earthworm?
yeah, you're the worm guy.
the radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's dna! you have any idea what that means?
no, but i have the feeling i'm about to find out.
it means that due to a man made accident the chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. mutated by seventeen percent?
seventeen percent, huh? sounds big.
they're enormous! a new species created by man's recklessness. that's what i've been trying to tell you, i'm only a biologist. i take radioactive samples and study them.
then you're perfect.  here's your radioactive sample. study it.
what sample?
you're standing on it.
that was a footprint. i was standing inside a footprint.
that's right.
but there's no animal in the world that can make prints like that? is there?
we're hoping you're going to help us figure that out.
somebody must have seen it.
it happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
hi. nick tatopoulos...
ah, elsie chapman, paleontologist.
and i'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of caiman's expense p.o.'s.
speak of the devil.
did you talk with humphries?
this is not the place...
just tell me, did you talk with him?
he said he'd consider it. it's between you and rodriguez.
are you serious? he's going to consider me for he job? what else did he say?
mr. caiman, you're married.
and you're beautiful...
mr. caiman...
call me charlie.
mr. caiman, i've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. and i've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. i'm too old to be an assistant anymore. i need to know this job is going someplace.
so have dinner with me tonight.
i can't.
it's your choice.
three years digging up worms in chernobyl? how did mrs. tatopoulos handle it?
oh, i'm not married.
really? a girlfriend then?
no. perhaps i work too much.
you mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart?
not for a long time, now.
well, i think you're cute.
oh, thank you.  is she always like this?
who are they? lieutenant, get those people away from there.
they are with me!
chargeures, property and casualty insurance. we are preparing a report.
you're fast.
that is our job.
well your people are getting in the way of my job.
major, what do you think could have done this?
get your people out of there or i will.
are you looking for this?
thanks.
the radiation is not an anomaly, it's the clue. this creature is far too unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.
don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.
what do we know? it was first sighted off the french polynesian pacific. an area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years.
hence the radiation.
more than that. i believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.
my life sucks.
oh, please, your life doesn't suck. his life sucks.
that's cuz i'm married to you.
shut up. how can you eat like that?
big bites.
i can't believe he put the moves on me. after everything i've done for him.
he's scum! as far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
i like that image.
you know how i spent last weekend? walking his damned dog.
i'm telling you he's dirt. he's a douche bag, gutter slime, dog crap, puke chunks...
hey, hey! i'm eating here!
audrey, you're too damned nice, that's your problem. nice gets you nothin' in this town. you gotta be a killer to get ahead, you know what i'm sayin'? i'm sorry, baby, but you just don't got what it takes.
animal, you don't think that's true, do you?
nice guys finish last. first rule of the jungle.
well, i can be tough if i want.
it's nick! i know that guy. i know him!
who is he?
he was my college sweetie! look at him. he looks so handsome on t.v. what the hell is he doing in panama.
did romeo have a name?
nick tatopoulos.
that why you dumped him?
no! i just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. i wanted to have some adventure, some fun...
how long where you and dis guy goin' steady?
nearly four years...
four years. girl, i'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.
that's the problem. he did.
evacuate manhattan? that's over three million people. has that ever been done before?
i don't think so.
great stuff, animal. weren't you scared?
sure i was. i thought lucy was gonna kill me.
audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
great. see ya then.
caiman, wait. take me with you.
what?
i've got something on this. i know a guy on the inside with the military...
not now. you got my bag?
you don't understand, i can get us information...
listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay honey?
what the hell are you doing?
remember my friend we saw on t.v.?
your old sweetheart?
yeah, well he just turned up in new jersey at the military command post. somehow all this is related to what happened down in panama. there's a story here. i know it. you got any tape or glue?
i left my forgery kit back at the office.
hey, do you have any glue in your bag?
what's it to you?
can i use some?
what do i get?
the warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
five bucks.
you're kidding, right?
wish me luck!
audrey, i don't think this is a very good idea. caiman finds out and he'll have your job.
i'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, luce. if there's a story here i'm going to find it.
we think there's a strong reason to believe it may be hiding inside one of the buildings within the sequestered area.
but you don't know for sure!
when we learned he could burrow his way through the tunnels we realized he could be out of the quarantined zone.
christ. how many tunnels lead off the island?
only five, sir. we've checked them all. he hasn't used any of them.
have them sealed off.
and how should we do that, sir?
fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, i don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
you know, he's not an enemy trying to evade you. he's just an animal.
what are you suggesting?
when i needed to catch earthworms, i knew the best way to catch them was not to chase them. i had to draw them out.
i'll take them all.
you must have quite some harem.
audrey?! is that you? hi, hello. you look, wow, uh, how've you been?
it's good to see you, nick.
so you made it.
what?
you're a reporter. that's what you always wanted to be, right? i'm happy for you. really, i am.
yeah, well...
so, you still picking apart cockroaches?
no, i'm into earthworms now. you wouldn't be interested. they're real "boring" creatures. very reliable, dependable, no surprises...
you're still mad at me, aren't you?
you just left me without a phone call, a letter, nothing. all this time. yeah, i guess i'm still a little mad.
that was eight years ago. some people change, you know.
most people don't.
i'm sorry you feel that way.
wait. i'm sorry. you're right. eight years is a long time. can i offer you a cup of tea?
sure. i'd like that.
i still can't believe it. how does a guy go from an anti-nuke activists to working for the nuclear regulatory commission?
when you and i use to attend rallies in college, we helped to create awareness. but from the inside now i can actually effect change.  i never lost my idealism.
and exactly what changes are you trying to effect?
i have this theory that we're inadvertently creating new species as a direct result of what we've done to nature.
and you think this creature is one of them?
yes. the first of its kind. i found this blood sample earlier this evening...
blood sample? how close did you get to that thing?
i got pretty close.
what else do you know about it?
...he's pregnant.
are you sure?
well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy.
i don't get it. if it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant?
the ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. that's why he came to new york. like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting!
nesting?
yes. do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time!
general anderson, the problem was the terrain. if we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of central park...  we should be able to take him down.
last time you didn't even scratch it!
that's not true. our worm guy, er, i mean, dr. tatopoulos found blood.
well, yes. i did. clearly he was injured and bled.
you see, all we need to do is get a better shot at it with weapons that don't rely on heat seeking...
um, excuse me, sir, but the situation's more complicated than that. the blood i recovered revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs or already has.
no, it reproduces asexually. that's why we must find the nest. if we don't, dozens will be born, each one capable of laying eggs of its own. very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.
so after we kill the creature we'll begin a search for the nest.
it may be too late by then. these eggs will hatch very quickly.
merde!
allez, allez!
you gave them the tape?
no, it's still in my tent. it's...oh my god, she took it.
he stole my report! that's my report!
we know, audrey.
i'm sorry about all this.
me too.
make sure they find that nest before it's too late.
i'll try.
is this cause of me? because of the story?
well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
you never said it was off the record.
i shouldn't have to, audrey. you're supposed to be my friend. i trusted you.
i didn't mean for it to turn out like this.  look, i lied to you. i'm not a reporter. when we broke up and i came out to new york i was so sure i'd make it. but i haven't. that's why i needed this story so bad. i just couldn't tell you i'm a failure.
so you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?
do i know you?
we've met before.
oh yeah, the insurance guy.
sdece, service de documentation exterieure et de contre-espionnage. agent phillip raymond.
sounds like a big company.
it's the french secret service.
oh.
we have learned that your american friends have decided not to look for the creature's nest.
are you sure? how do you know?
we know.
why are you telling this to me?
i need you to trust me.
why do you need that?
i need your trust if you're to help me find the nest.
oh, my bags. i've checked them in.
we, have already taken care of them.
how did you get all of this stuff into the country?
this is america. there is nothing you can not buy.
so why all the secrecy? why aren't you guys working with the us military?
i am not permitted to speak of such things.
i am a patriot. i love my country. can you understand that?
sure.
it is my job to protect my country. sometimes i must even protect it from itself. from mistakes we have made. mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
your talking about the nuclear testing in the pacific.
yes. this testing done by my country left a terrible mess. we are here to clean it up.
they will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten.
that is when we will go in.
here. 23rd street subway station. where we first found the fish. with a little luck, this will lead us right to it.
so you're in?
are you kidding? i always wanted to join the french foreign legion.
who the hell are all these people?
what? i just couldn't just let them sleep in the street.
where's audrey?
in the bedroom. crying her eyes out because of you.
what?
all that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.
me!? you where the one...
go in there. talk to her.
you okay?
it's all my fault. what have i done, animal? what have i become? look at me. this isn't me. i don't do things like this.
you made a mistake.
yeah, i just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me.
didn't you tell me he left for the airport?
yeah. why are you asking?
i just saw him. he's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight.
my god. he's going after the nest.
perfect! you wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
animal, i can't.
look, you want to make it up to your friend? well if he's right, this is your chance.
what are you doing?
lucy'd kill me if she knew.
what's with the chewing gum?
makes us look more american.
what are you doing?
it's the maintenance entrance. runs along the side of the tunnel. when they repaired it last year i worked on a piece about it.
they've turned off the ventilation system. they're calling him to dinner.
let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres.
three eggs. i thought there would be more.
you were right.
i think we should leave now.
good idea.
don't you think we have enough?
yes. definitely. definitely enough.
contact the military and get them to send a bomber to blow up this building before these things escape.
how do i do that?
555-7600. tell them it's a code dragonfly. they should get you through.
do you have any idea what's going on out there? the phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
we're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
that thing's dead. what the hell are we waiting for?
organize a search party. i want a complete sweep of the entire city and subway system.
you don't have the authority to do that.
what'd they say?
i can't get through. i don't know what's wrong.
we've secured the doors on both levels.
where's luc and pierre?
they didn't make it.
nick, my men and i will hold them here. you will have to go and get help!
think we can fit up in there?
only one way to find out.
who the hell are you?
it's okay. i know her.
what are you doing here?
i thought you said there'd only be a dozen eggs.
i was wrong.
circuits are overloaded.
i know a way. i know how you can get a message out of here.
come on, the broadcast booth is right over here.
how do you know?
our network covers the ranger games.
the network is on an intranet. it's a direct feed into our computer system.
your station won't have any easier time contacting the military than i did.
he's not going to do it.
oh yes he will.
if the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape.
oh my god! they're coming!
are you okay?
somehow i never thought your life was this exciting.
you'd be surprised.
really? i'd like to find out.
cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up broadway.
you're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the jfk.
the jfk? in the rain!?
what are you talking about? the east side is always faster.
but we can get to the west side faster.
we did it! we've got the exclusive! way to go, audrey!
we? i don't think so.
i want that story, audrey. remember you work for me.
not anymore. mr. caiman, i quit.
audrey, did you take the tape out of the camera?
no.
hello?
it's raymond.
where are you?
i understand.
i just wanted to say, au revoir and thank you for your help, my friend.
wait.  au revoir.
who was that french guy, anyway.
oh, just some insurance guy.
