one, up.
lucky.
told you i was nice.  I am going to be the first girl in the nba.
i'ma be in the nba.  you are going to be my cheerleader.
she needs to stop running around like a little boy.
she is alright.
how is she alright looking the way she does?
camille, she will be fine.
boy, what did i tell you about using that word?
"can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
why not?
cause when you say can't, you am not a man.
that is right.
zeke.
what?  oh, and, uh, do not say "shit."
we should head over.
just you and quincy, baby.  i got a meeting.
with who?
business folks.
you just got back from a four game road trip.
nona, do not start bitching.  i got maybe two years left to play.  I am just trying to put some things together for us.
what?
we still have to go?
yeah.
...we moved back here when quincy was about five, after zeke was traded. neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
until the black family down the street became the black family next door.
okay?
well, thanks again.  this was really nice of you.
it was the least we could do.  and i love to cook.
oh, me too.  i used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in atlanta.
you are a caterer?
well, no, but once nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it is definitely something i want to do.  since you love to cook, maybe it is something we can talk about.
you know, girl, long as I have lived next door, I have never seen the inside of this house.
really?  well, come on, then.
so...does it hurt?
it is this big hole.  you could almost see bone.
for real?
uh huh.
so how come you could play basketball?
i just can.
i never knew a girl that could play.
my mom says she does not know where i come from 'cause i act different.
your dad play?
he works at a bank.
my dad plays for the "clippers."  he says i'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but i'ma play for them, too.  same number and everything.
I am going to be number thirty-two, like magic.
he is alright, but my dad can take him.
what was the most points your daddy ever got in junior high?
i do not know.  a lot.
one time magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
you do act different.
i do not care.
well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause i run this street.
I would just tell my sister, lena.
she do not know how to box, i bet.  my dad showed me how to fight like ali.
monica, what did you do?
nothing.
oh, all that work.
ah, mom.
I am lucky i found it.  someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
i hate it.
fine, you do not like this one, which one would you rather wear?
pants.
when you are done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
are you okay?
i just need to lay down.  I have been running around all day.
which one for tomorrow?
the blue.
you sure?
okay.
thanks, sweetheart.
what do i have to do?
i guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together.  and if you get mad at me, i gotta give you flowers.
i do not like flowers.
oh.
how bout twinkies?  my mom will not ever buy them.
kay.
okay.
i think we gotta kiss now.
for how long?
five seconds.
i want to ride my own bike.
my dad always drives my mom.
so?
so that means i have to ride with you.
i do not have to do what you say.
man, forget you then, stupid.
you are stupid.  and your daddy plays for the worst team in the nba.
what?
last time they won, dr. j. was a nurse.
shut up!
...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.
but you use potato?
dad, you have to talk to coach for me.
and what am i supposed to say to the man?
the coach from tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
you lost your head.
i was just showing emotion.
so that means it is alright for you to act like that?
what did you do?
nothing.
i do not know why i keep hoping you will grow out of this tomboy thing.
i won't.  I am a lesbian.
that is not funny
well, that is what you think, is not it? cause I would rather wear a jersey than an apron...
watch your mouth.
monica, i think her point is...maybe it is time to start thinking about other things besides basketball.
what?
you only have one game left and you have not been recruited.  munchkin, i wanted it as bad as you did, but we have to face reality.
the coach from usc is going to be at the championship.
i know.  but chances are...
chances are there is still a chance.
hey, girl.
hey.
your hair looks so cute like that.
no.
c'mon, girl, you live next door.  who is been creeping?
there is so many i just can not keep track.
well, can you give him this for me?
give it yourself.
i do not wanna look fast.  thanks, girl.
quincy, word has it you might make the jump the nba.
do not go starting rumors, jim.  my son's college bound with or without basketball.
you could make a career by telling me where.
gotta wait til the press conference.
but you would love for him to play at usc, like you did.
I would love for him to get a good education.  that is it.
pop, there is no way an ivy league team is going all the way.
i do not care about the team.  i care about the school.
did not we already have this conversation?
yeah?  so you up for a game later?
i do not wanna hurt your feelings.
you do not wanna hurt your back.
anyway, i got to get to this meeting. tell your mom I am going to be late.
you work too hard, pop.
let's hope i can say the same about you one day.
way to hoop.
i know this.  what do you want?
a ride home.
your legs do not look broke.
look, big head, I will be at your car.
guess "please" would be a stretch.
please.
what is that?
some note shawnee easton told me to give to you.
big-ass titties?
why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
she is a ho cause she is sending her coochie through the mail.
and?
and?  she is not saying, "i think you are a nice guy and i wanna get to know you better," she is saying, "i wanna bone."
so she is honest.
yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  but i guess you will stick your dick in anything.
did not know you cared so much.
i don't.
so who you going to the dance with, spalding?
who is spalding?
see, that is why you am not getting recruited.
who said I am not getting recruited?
your hot-ass temper.
I am not the one who put this scar here.
god, here we go.
when we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose.
that is it, give it your best shot.
would you watch the damn road?
i mean it, give it your best shot, cause I am tired of you holding that over my head.
I am warning you, do not tempt me.
I am warning you.  you do not stall that bad attitude, no one's going to recruit you.
please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  but because I am a female, i get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I am a ballplayer, okay.  a ball player.
with a jacked-up attitude.
did not know you cared so much.
i don't.
good.
what is this?
uh, your earring?
i look like some hoochie to you?  i found it on your floor.
what are you doing in my room?
quincy, i told you about these fat-ass girls.
we were just studying.
I am not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  they see you, they see dollar signs.
okay.
you hearing me?
I have been hearing you.
how was your game?
twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
still the man.
yup.
where is your dad?
said he would be home later.
later when?
i do not know, he had a meeting or something.
i had some players to see and hands to shake.
at one in the morning?
I am not going to get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife does not get an attitude.
i came second to the nba.  I am not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
yeah.
I am just saying it would be nice if you found time for your family. you should see the tramps coming after quincy.  if you do not talk to him...
i have.
you said you would think about going back to get your degree.
no, you said i should get my degree.  i like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it is going to lead to a spot in the front office. til then, do not worry, there is just enough savings to keep your ass in gucci and gold.
fine, then how many nights home is that?
keep your voice down.
that too tight?
no.
mom's going to hate it.
always on my ass, anyway.
like you do not give her a hard time.
just cause i do not kiss her booty like you...
you need to.  she is alone in this house all day, taking care of dad and your ungrateful behind.
no one's forcing her.
just try and chill a little bit, alright.
so what is going on with the spring dance? you have a date yet?
yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
i found you someone.
found?  I am not some charity case.
i know...
mom tell you to do this?
no.
damn, lena...  who is he?
this brother from my college.
he is in college?
and he is fine, girl.
how did you get him to say yes?
i told him you looked like me.
oh, great.
you do.
yeah, right.
if you were tore up i would not be claiming you.  trust.
i do not know how to walk in heels.
hey.  you just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. let me worry about your date.
you ever been in love?
too many times.
they ever love you back?
yeah, once i cut them off.  why?
taste this.
i can not eat before a game.
child, take a bite.
you really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
sure.  in between all the other things i have to do.
what?
nothing.  so good luck.
what?
tonight, do not worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. i just want you to enjoy being beautiful. will you do that?
can i take your coat?
you are cold?
no, i mean i can check it for you.
oh, sorry.
see you made it.
yeah.
you do not look half-bad.
you either.
I am an english major.  you like english?
sort of.
careful.
huh?
that was two words.
sorry.
i mean, I am having a good time with you...
my mouth is kinda dry.
then I will get you some punch.
hey.
hey.
you having fun?
yeah.
yeah, the dj's kinda whack, though.  so who is this clown?
he am not spalding.
guess not.
so you took shawnee, huh?
that was nice.
uh-huh.
your sister told me hands off, but i can not help myself...
wait...
shh.  it is okay.
early night for you, is not it?
i was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
mulholland drive.
figures.
so what dead-end street did you and shawnee hit?
none of your business.
well, I am sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
that what you think?
why?
cause i do not just stick my dick in anything.
four.
what?
you had four offensive rebounds.
when'd you get this?
it was on my bed when i came in.  can you just...?
you sure?
what was that about?
i know, right?
i can take it.
this time get your feet set.
coach hates me, does not she?
she hates all freshmen.
what is up with that?
hey, do not take it personal.  and do not think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  we are teammates, okay?
thanks, sidra.
besides.  I have been starting point the last two years.  am not no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
you finish the reading for e-con?
yeah.
what did it say?
basically broke down how I am going to make mad loot in the nba, me being such a limited commodity and all.
whatever, big head.
what?
you do see me standing here, right?
i can not be nice to a fan?
fine, quincy.
i can not help girls coming up to me.
i said fine.
it is okay, little baby.
quit.
what?
you love to pose so much, let's see it again.
coach...
i want you to stand like that until you are sick of it because i do not ever want to see it again, you hear me?  dora, take her spot.
that is what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
i was just playing ball.
you were trying to make me look bad.
did not have to try very hard.
forget tonya randall.
I am telling you, coach wishes she was here instead of me.
then prove her wrong.
i do not have it easy like you, alright. there is no red carpet laid out for me.
so you are going to act salty all night?
that was so weak.
who cares if you are never known as the first girl in the nba.  you will get more play behind quincy mccall's woman anyway.
so how about a little one-on-one?
what are we playing for?
clothes.
what?
give me the ball.
my court, i go first.
kiss my booty.
plan to.
yo, where is the "d"?
right here.
i won.
i wanted you to.
what people?
you know, people.
well, tell them to mind their damn business.  you are smart enough to get a degree.
I am also good enough to go pro.
you know how much higher the play level is in the nba?  give yourself time to develop, quincy.  get an education.  the nba am not going nowhere.
you came out early.
your mom got pregnant and i had to make choices.  you do not have a choice.
okay...
besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you will have to deal with the mess I am dealing with.
what mess?
there is this thing out there.  this paternity suit.
what?
some girl that is been hanging on at every party.  now I am supposed to be her baby's daddy.  anyway, i told your mom i wanted to be the one who told you.
tell me what?
i just told you.
i mean, it is not true, is it?
sorry.
no, you need to hear me say it, I will say it.  it is not true.
so what are you gonna do?
i want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
why?
a case like this could hang around for months and I am up for this player relations job with the "clips."  this gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me.
what is mom think?
we have not exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  we will just have to see how it plays out.  I am giving her some space, couple days...
you scared me.
sorry.  you okay?
I am fine.
guess he talked to you.
do not sweat it, okay.  sooner or later the truth'll come out.
whose truth are you talking about?
mom, we can not let something like this mess up the family.
just...leave it alone.
this is just about money, you know that.
quincy, please...
i mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
guess i should have been telling your father.
so you are going to take the word of some trick over pop's?  he would not lie.
do not put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I am hanging on his every word like he is god or something...
i know he messed up, but that does not change what he is been to you.
what has he been to me?  i mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing.  like it was easy.  and I am standing there getting loud on my mom like she is the one with no sense...
she understands.
he even had me wanting to play for the "clippers."  man, how stupid am i.
you are not stupid.
i know a lot of brothers dog their wives, i just never thought my pops would do some shit like this...
nothing.  why do not we walk to my dorm?
I am not up for running into anybody. let's just kick it here, alright?
i...can't.
why not?
coach has us on eleven of the clock curfew. if I am late, i do not suit up.
did not realize you were watching the clock.
i mean, i can stay a few more minutes.
nah.  do not sweat it.
quincy...
for real.  i should be alone, anyway.
you could have given up after you threw that ball away.  but you kept your head and you showed real heart.
thanks.
we have got our final games against oregon and oregon state and i want to shake things up a bit, so I am starting you at point again.
i thought sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
you want the job or not?
what?
it is just...it seems like you are always yelling at me.
you think I would go hoarse for a player with no potential?   when i ignore you, that is when you worry.  go get dressed.
hey.
what is up?
I have been trying to find you all day.
here i am.
sorry about your game.
it happens, right...
he is just playing, q...
you think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
what is up?
just wanted to say good game.
but?
no buts.  took a lot of heart to take that charge.
thanks.
but that was a dumb-ass pass to toni. ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
i know.
just one word of advice for next season.
what is that?
never let a freshman take your spot.
who was that?
nobody.
who is nobody?
look, this party's whack.  you ready to go?
you want to go talk?
not really.
you know what, I am just going to crash.
fine...maybe I will come by later.
nah.  i have curfew.
what are you doing here?
your door was unlocked.
still is, so let yourself out.
we need to talk.
we am not got nothing to talk about.
i messed up, okay, i know that.  but i am not that kid's father.
lucky kid.
look, i am not saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
and some things should never fucking happen!
boy, you are so perfect you can look down on me?
i am not a damn liar.
your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, was not she? well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and do not get me wrong, you are the best thing in my life, but she knew i was not ready for no marriage.
so now you are saying my mother trapped you?
I am saying i handled my responsibilities like a man.  but when you are in the nba, you pull into a city and there is a hundred women waiting at the hotel.  and another twenty that made it past security on your floor.  and the boldest one is standing right at your door.  and after awhile, it just becomes part of the game.  I am sorry i lied to you, i should not have.  but i did it cause i love you.
since we are being honest, guess i should tell you.  I am dropping out of school and going pro.
what?
from your mouth.
i know your mad at me, okay, but i can not let you do this.
always thought "can't" was not in a man's vocabulary.
hey.
hey, what is up.
you were not at my game.
yeah, sorry about that.  i had this meeting with this guy.
yeah, i hit a three at the buzzer.
the "man" again.
woman...
oh, kerry, this is monica.  monica, kerry.
what the hell's going on?
we are going to get some food.
are you out of your mind?
monica.  what are you doing here?
did not know i needed a reason to come home.
do not be defensive.  I am just surprised to see you.
dad around?
he is still at the bank.
what?
whenever you lose, you get this attitude. but it is just a game.
can we talk?
talk to your new girlfriend.
i just took the ho to burger king, alright.
cheap date.
least she had time for me.
so you fucked around to prove a point!
i just said i did not fuck around.  but you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
what, "q-man", did i forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
you forgot to be there.
that night you wanted to talk about your dad i had a curfew.  what was i supposed to do?
stay!
if i stayed, i would not be starting!
least you got your priorities straight.
i never asked you to choose.
never had to.
I am a ballplayer.  if anyone knows what that means it should be you.
well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me?  go fuck dick vitale.
how do i know next time you are feeling neglected or whatever, you are not going to run around on me?  if we are going to be together i have to be able to trust you.
I am not asking for us to be together.
what?
I am going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
how are you going to tell me what i have time for?  i mean, whatever i did...we can fix this.
i do not think so.
you do not think so?
look, I am entering the draft.
you are what?
i decided to go pro.  and who knows where I will end up, you know?
when did you decide all this?
few days ago.
so that is it, just forget about us?
damnitt, monica.  this am not about us anymore, it is about me.
so...i guess I will see you around.
uh huh.
well, what do you know.
what is up, sidra.
I am going to love winning this championship in your house.
how do you say "you're dreaming" in italian?
can you take that damn thing off the table.
you mean my championship trophy?  my bad.
yeah, four years ago.  they had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I am not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  then the whack club I am on loses three games in a row and i get blamed.  so they fire me.
just like that?
yup.  so I have been playing with this italian club the last three years.
how is that been?
it is better.  even though the whole first season my teammates did not pass to me cause they were mad "the american" was making more money.  i led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way i could touch the damn ball.
so what are these spanish guys like?
i would not know.
what?  you have been over here seven months and you am not tapped anything?
just not my type, i guess.
shoot, italian boys love them some black women.  they can not get enough of me.
you ever think about going back?
sometimes.  but what is the alternative, not playing?  you remember big toni?  she quit last year, now she is working at some bookstore.  i mean, look at us. they treat us like we are hollywood stars over here.  we just played in the championship game.  it does not get much sweeter than this.
not great.
what is that, not great?
the doctor'll be back in a minute.
nona, please.
he tore his acl.
almost did not recognize you with your hair like that.  how you been?
happy.  and he will not want to see you.
what do you want?
came by to check on you.
after five years.
do not remember that being my fault. seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
look, I am busy.
i can see that.  i know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can not get down on yourself.
i stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
no.
good.
quincy.  i know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
and now I am paying for it, right?  that what this is about?  "i told you so?"
you want me to fuck off?
yeah.
fine, I will fuck off, but not til i say something.
alright.  i heard you were in spain.
i was.  i see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
just something I am trying.
no, it looks good.  i mean, it is cool.
thanks.
should not you be lying down, or...
I am alright.  but you can sit.
I am fine.  my dad said you tore your acl.
yup.
what are the doctors saying?
a lot of things.  all i know is I will be back in six months.
i thought a torn acl was ten to twelve.
not for quincy mccall.
i forgot, "q-man."
so, how is pro-ball, europe?
we won the championship.
still working on being the first girl in the nba?
well, i tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
funny.  i never did.
kiss my ass.
tried calling you a couple times.
oh yeah?
wanted to give you props on making first team all-american.  and then when magic retired, i tried calling you again.
must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  it was always messing up.
figured it was something like that.
actually, i don't...
what do you mean?
I am tired of playing overseas.  thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
a rest?
yeah.  basketball just, is not fun anymore.  you know?
no.
I am so sorry.  no one would switch flights with me.
it is okay.
why are you up?  get in bed.
hello.
kyra, this is monica.  she, uh...
monica.  you grew up together, right? quincy's told me about you.
it means a lot that you came by.
yes, we appreciate that.
yeah, and quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
thanks.
hi.
need any help?
i can manage.
yeah.  can not wait to see him  i just saw quincy.
how is he?
engaged.
to that stewardess?
yeah, you met her?
his mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. he could do a lot better if you ask me.
maybe she is.
so what do i do?
find out where they are registered and send them a gift.
whatever.
you did not want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
i asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
do not curse.
there you go.
what do you want me to tell you, monica, to go beat that girl up?  to go have sex with him?  I am not going to do that. yes, i believe thinking of other people is important and yes I would rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  if that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
so that is why we can not get along? because I would rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
you are the one always turning your nose up at me.
no i don't.
child, please.  ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything i had to say.
i was not lena.  i did not care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
what was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things i knew could help you?
because you are pushing me to be something I am not.
so you are angry with me because you are standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
I am angry because i want a mother, not martha stewart.
oh, yes.  the superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
that is not it.
do not tell me you are not ashamed of that because i know.
i remember when i was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  all you would let me and lena do was set the table.  and i guess you and dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  and you did not say anything. you just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
i do not remember that.
i do.  you never stood up for yourself. ever.  if i was ashamed, it was because of that.
that is ridiculous.
what is ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.
that is all you cared about.  i must have played in a thousand games and i can only remember you being to two.
you had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  it never mattered one way or the other if i went to your games.
it mattered, mom.
damn, girl.
what?
i do not wanna see that.
get used to it, babe.
so how long is this trip?
four days.
nah.
why not?
you might be the only one with a job.
baby, do not talk like that.  your rehab's going well.  you will be back before you know it.
sometimes i wonder if it is worth it. busting my ass, for what?
to do what you love.
i do not know sometimes.
you are just scared.  i know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you will be as good as you were but you will be.  i believe in you.  you just have to get back on the court.  like you would get back on a horse.
a horse?
do not make fun of me when I am being wonderful and supportive.  you belong on the court.  just like i belong in the stands, looking cute and cheering you on.
hey, munchkin.
dad.  what are you doing here?
i was upstairs for a meeting.  I have been hearing good things about you.
that tends to happen when you are the boss's daughter.
so how is the job going?
you shoot like a girl.
I will take that as a compliment.
you visiting?
kyra's gone for a couple days.  figured I would keep mom company.
who is this guy i always see her around?
darryl.  he is alright, kinda corny.
so...how's the knee?
getting there.
strong enough to get you down the aisle?
yeah.  two weeks.  i did not get to send you an invitation, but if you...
that is okay.  I am probably, you know, busy.
it just isn't.
because I am kinda feeling that way, too.
you had a rough couple years, that is all.
that a nice way of saying i rode the bench?
and you tore up your knee.  rehab is tough.
nah.  i have not dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  maybe i miss some of the attention, but besides that...
you are serious.
seems like i needed a ball when i was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him.  now, i kinda think i need to try something else.
like what?
maybe go back to school.
wow.
i mean, kyra has not heard the school thing yet.  she will probably say it is the painkillers talking.
it is a trip, you know?  when you are a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it is not going to turn out that way.
so why did you give up ball?
why do you keep asking me that?
cause i do not get it.
something was just missing.
what?
it does not matter, alright.  just leave it alone.
find.
so you are still breast-feeding?
the doctor said it was okay.  anyway, I am still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
you might want to put a jacket on him, it is getting cold.
he is fine.
okay.
what are you talking about?
when i said quincy could do better, i was thinking about you.
what is going on?
we need to talk.
you asked me what was missing.
what?
from basketball.
you woke me up to tell me that?
it is not fun for me anymore because you are missing.
i heard enough.
what I am trying to say is, I have loved you since i was eleven and the shit will not go away.
we have not talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
i know, i probably should have said it two weeks ago.
you have not changed.  you still think the sun rises and sets on your ass.  well, guess what, it doesn't.
then why are you so upset?
because you do not pull this on someone who is about to get married.
better late than never, right?
wrong.
I will play you.
what?
one game.  one-on-one.
for what?
your heart.
you are out of your mind.
so you are going to bitch up?
what is that supposed to be, psychology?
i know why you broke up with me in college.  and not that what you did was not messed up, but what i did was, too.  so if you forgive me, I will forgive you.
monica, after that stuff with my dad, i could not trust anybody, okay.  i mean, i was lost.  so you are forgiven.  but that was five years ago.  i moved on.
what will this prove?
you once said the reason i beat you was because you wanted me to.
so?
so, if i win it is because deep down you know you are about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
and what happens when you lose?
if i lose, I will buy you a wedding present.
