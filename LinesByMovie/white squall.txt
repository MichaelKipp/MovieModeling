you gonna jump?  or are you just having a last look?
i was just thinking that i never had a new pair of shoes till i was twelve.
it's no my fault i was born first. besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
it's not a vacation, it's private school.
i thought this was your dream come true.
that's not why he's sending me.
why then.
because it looks good.
i'm just not like you.  ya know? i'm never going to go to yale.  i'm never going to be "william".
nobody says you have to be like me.
he does.
you don't give him enough credit chas.
honey, did you know that the albatross was captured by the germans during world war ii?
no, i didn't.
it says she was originally schooner rigged, but captain sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  i think square rigs look so much more romantic.
me too.
do you have your ticket?
yes.
passport?
look, i just better go.
goodbye mom.  i'll be okay.
i know you will.
make us proud.
yes sir.
albatross?
yeah.
rick march.  who the hell are you?
gieg, chuck.
look, meet us out front when you're through.  if they try to take anything away from you like johnny quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
whatever.
what the "bowsprit affair"?
well, romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
what the hell is going on?
maybe it's an air raid.
i don't.
you will if you wanna eat.  right george?
jesus.
i can't watch this.
what's your problem?
why'd you jump?
because i felt like it.  what do you care?
i couldn't do it.
well, as soon as you grow some balls, let me know.
don't ever call me stupid.
come on, he didn't mean anything.
okay, here's the duty.  gieg, weathers, lapchick, schucart: scrape and paint.  corry and stricklin have the brass.  robinson, you're the galley slave.  march you're on chain gang with barnes. johnston, solo on bilge detail.
butler, what'd i ever do to you?
you came back, tod.  you came back.
albatross?  doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
oh, on the contrary, the albatross is considered a very good omen.  it is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  it's very bad luck if you kill one.  and dolphins too.
i'm francis boutillier.  this is my son, philip.
i know.
you're a day late.  we keep a schedule aboard ship.  lives depend on it.  hello, philip.
sir.
your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-october.
as you can see, there's a lot to do.
indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
this is a working ship.  promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  had we been ready, i can assure you we would have sailed.
and i would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
happily, it all worked out... this time.  bill, take philip below and help him find a bunk.
i'll be frank with you.  this was his mother's idea.  a romp through the caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
it will be more than that, i can promise you.
take good care of my son.
we'll do our best.  you're welcome to say goodbye.
he's a big boy.
well, that was neighborly.
he didn't get to be under secretary of the air force by being neighborly.
everyone aboard young bill?
yes, sir.
good.  let's go sailing.
hold her steady into the wind. southwest by west.
yes sir.
gentleman, when you hear an order, sing out.  i want to know that you've heard and understand.  raise the mainsail.
what's wrong mr. lawford.
it seems we're short on singers.
tie it off!!
outer.
we'll bear off to port and run down wind.
mr. lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  rick, get on the jib sheet.  george, john, philip, tim and dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  george will show you what to do.  tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. forecourse first... work upward.
ah... northeast... sir.
speak up boy!
northeast sir!
unfurl the squares!
raise the inner jib!  raise the forestaysail!
watch the tell-tales chuck.  if we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
yes, sir.
all stop on the engine.
did we lose anybody?
not yet.
that low passed through last night. may be a little bumpy out there.
it's time these boys saw some real blue water.
suicidal...
the first thing is i don't like people talking when i'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
that's not a satisfactory answer.
look, save it for somebody else will ya.  this ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me.
i'll read it.  i mean i don't mind.
shut up donut.
much have i traveled in realms of gold/ and many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ round many western islands have i been/ which bards in fealty to apollo hold/ oft of one wide expanse had i been told/ that deep-browed homer ruled as his demesne.
you know what he is talking about here?
this isn't just a story!!  it's history made allegory.  it is a philosophical handbook for life!  it holds the secret of this very voyage.
what is it... the secret?
what?
if it were only that simple, my young friend.  read on, gentlemen. read on.
you all right?
it was my fault.  i slipped.
why wasn't i made aware of this bill?
i didn't know sir.
it's your job to know.  if something goes wrong up there, the other eighteen people aboard can't be wondering if he's gonna do his job or not.
swing up, son.
what?
up you go.  right now.
do you have something to say?
no.
then keep your mouth shut.
what's it going to be?
i'm sorry...
sorry won't cut it.
what are you blubbering about?
i don't know...
don't look down.  look in my eyes! climb!  we'll do it together.
i can't.
you climb damn it, or so help me i'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
aaauuuhhh!!!
are you hating this?!  are you!
i hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
no.  hate the fear inside of you! climb like a man mister!  hate it! hate it away.  hate your way up one more rung!!  do it right now!!
no, sir.
excellent.  bill, find mr. weathers a position to suit his condition.
remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.
face what?
i think you were too hard on weathers.
you do?
yes.  i do.
i need to know what i'm working with; what their boundaries are. their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  we've got to bring them together.  make them a crew.  we're as strong as our weakest link and i don't want to find that out the hard way.  so, i will challenge them and they will come together.
yes sir.
you know the best thing about being a skipper is the worst thing.  it's all my responsibility.  so i'll tell you what george, you stay off of my bridge, and i'll stay out of your galley.  we'll get along that way.
how ya doing?
fine.
good.
look, i appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, i can take care of myself.
i just brought you something to eat.
i feel like i got you into this.
forget it.
i'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  i guess that's what i thought it would be out here.  but, it's not is it?
i'm sorry i left you hanging up there.
it doesn't matter.  really.  i'm just sorry you got chewed out.
come in.
skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
well, that's all part of it.
we've got weather moving in from the west.
uh, huh.
would you, um, say it's a big storm?
sometimes it gets exciting out here.
what do you think?
barometer's dropping.  the first blow'll come from the south.  might get interesting.
shouldn't we turn away?
you can't run from the wind son. you trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
looks like weather.
yep.
do me a favor and tell bill once she's dogged down i want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  lawford, bill, mike, john, and phil will stand the watch.  everyone else hit the racks.
i'm not staying out here.
everyone out of the rigging now!
everybody down!  on the double!!
if you've got "a broad" available i'll take her.
like you'd know what to do with one.
you gotta be kidding?  he's a human chum line!
no self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
you think skipper and alice do it?
do what?
ya know... "it".
that's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  who wants to know?
she isn't that old.
what do you mean?
i mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty.
how would you know?
trust me donut.  i know.
what?  come on...
on the dog watch, night after the storm, i look down into the skylight above skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
no way!
come on man, what'd they look like?
damn, porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
i've seen 'em.  i've seen 'em.
i walked in on my parents one time. it was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and i thought that was kinda weird so i just walked in.
that's what they get for not locking the door.
so i'm standing there and you could hear a pin drop.  no breathing or snoring... suddenly it hits me that somethin' was goin' on that just stopped, really fast, like people are holding their breath.
so... what happened?
my mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "what?"
what'd you do?
i said "sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
my parents don't do it anymore.
how do you know?  they might.
'cause they're getting a divorce.  that's why they sent me here.  my sister's at tabor.  they just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business.
they tell you that?
i figured it out.
yeah.
my old man split along time ago.  it doesn't mean anything.  you just take care of number one that's all that matters.
it matters to me.
okay donut.  whatever you say.
where are you from any way?
depths of hell... ohio.  how 'bout you?
kennet square, pa.  'mushroom capital of the world'.
sorry to here it.
well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  bein' here together an all...
i have arranged to host a good will cruise for the dutch students of the local school there.
joy, rapture...
each one of you will be responsible for one student.  i'll expect you to be courteous.  you represent this school and your country.  we'll sail in the morning.
hey, shut up will ya?
it was a bad dream...
it was so real...
here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  you'll be out of it.  you'll wake up.
who told you that?
my dad.
it works?
swear to god.  only good advice he ever gave me.  now, go back to sleep.
that's how he died you know.
who?
my brother.  he fell out of the old beech tree.  broke his neck.  i was on a camp out.  they started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  they didn't find him 'till the next morning.  they didn't even know why he was up there.
jesus, you never told them?
i couldn't.
what?!  what's happening?!!
you're officer of the watch, george.
i'm sorry, skip.  it's this damned book.  lawford gave it to me.
son-of-a-bitch.
we're short one long boat too.  come on.
oh i was walkin' down lime street one day...
hey!  weigh!  blow the man down...
a pretty young maiden she happened my way...
give me some time to blow the man down...
i guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be...
what's that?
a padlock.
so to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
weight!  hey!  blow the man down...
she said "none the better, you all go to hell..."
give me some time to blow the man down!
immortality.
spirits have a way of bringing that out.
and being sixteen.
they're in a hurry to grow up.  they don't know about consequences or responsibility.  that's being sixteen too.  i promise you one thing...
what's that?
they'll know about it in the morning.
oh jesus, oh jesus.  man i knew we shouldn't have gone.  i tried to tell you.  i tried to tell you.  you guys made me come!  you made me come!!
will you shut up?  you sound like my fucking sister.
yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
that's enough.
how the hell are we gonna get outta here?
we'll think of something.
oh, praise the lord.  relax everybody.  everything is under control.  the jug head's going to think of something.
god damn it man.  i think he broke my nose!
shut up, phil.
where you going?
to take a piss.
yeah, that's right.  you wanna come in and shake it for me?
if you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
you've gotta be kidding.  get the fuck outta my way!
why, man?
i don't have to listen to this.
i cheated to get on the boat!!!  all right?!
what?
i doctored my grades so i'd make the cut.  i'm a moron, okay?  you satisfied?!
you're not a moron.
wanna bet?  takes me half a day to get through one chapter of lawford and i still don't have any idea what the hell he's talkin' about.  you know why it takes me so long to write papers?  because i can't spell.  while everybody else is sleeping, i'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary.
hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause i couldn't read a slide rule.
i can show you how to use a slide rule.
how long you been standing there?
long enough.
they were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  i stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. shit, who am i kidding.  i'll never pass the boards.
listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  we'll start a private study group.  nobody knows.  you'll ace that test.
me, too.
why would you do that?
what are they doing?
i can't make it out?
they're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
what?
what are we supposed to talk about?
you've gotta be kidding?
but, they don't speak english.
there are some things that everybody does in the same language.
yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
like this!
well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.
and, of course, we are.
well, you never can tell these days, can you?
what is it we can do for you today?
well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
bregitta.  do you believe it?
believe what?
her name.  bregitta.  it's poetry.
soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
don't mind him, chucky.  you're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of vaseline.
screw you, valentino.  i haven't seen you swapping spit with anybody.
what's wrong, you don't like steak?
i should be eating with the crew.
humor me.  eat it anyway.
why are you here?
spying?!
i can take care of myself.
oh, really?
look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  i didn't want to come but i did.  why do you have to embarrass me.  why can't you just leave me alone?
listen to me, you thankless little prick.  we're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. what the hell is it, this captain? because i'll see him in a rowboat...
it has nothing to do with him.
well, what does it have to do with? us?
no.  look, it's me okay?  can't it just be about me?  for once?
he would have loved this.
your father?
all his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
you miss him.
i'd have liked to have said goodbye.
he knows.
you sound so sure.
i am about this.
what?
he never would have believed a woman like you existed.
do you remember the last time you and i danced under the stars?
guilty.
on the deck of the yankee, the night you asked me to marry you.  we weren't much older than they are.
phil.  what are you doing?
fandango, junior.  i'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
no way phil.  not like this.
roger meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
it's outta here!
come on man.  let's just talk about it.
jesus!  what the hell happened to him.
lemme go!  lemme go!!
i don't know.  we gotta get 'im outta here before skipper sees him like this.
son of a bitch!!
the rust won't wait for you to read conrad, goodall.
then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, mr. lawford.
read on, young john.  read on. college boards are coming.
fuck off man.  it's just a fish.
no, phil.  it's a mammal.
i'm not gonna kill it.
you already have.  now go on.  do it.
why'd you do it?
what's the difference?
you only hurt yourself you know?
like you really care.  like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
you're the one who doesn't care, phil.
it hurts too much to care.
about yourself?
about anything.
i can't go in there.
what are you talking about.
what's on your mind?
i'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
well, spit it out.
the fact is... we'd like you to give phil another chance.
can't do it.
sir...?
close the door.  sit down.
why do you think i'm sending him home?
he killed the dolphin.
the dolphin was a symptom.
of what?
of a fight he can't win out here.
it's his father sir.  he's suffocating him.  we've all seen it...
i mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  what right did then have to show up here?
they have every right chuck.
they send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same.
does phil know how you guys feel?
i don't know.
you should tell him.  that's something he can take with him.
you may not like what you hear.
i can take it.
they've become what you wanted. they're a crew.  that's why he came.
why did we begin this?
we were idealists.
because we believed we could make an impact out here.  self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
i haven't forgotten.
phil, he's not looking inside.  he's just striking out at the world.
he has a lot of hurt inside him.
well, he better learn to own it. actions have consequences.  it's not what happens here alice, it's what they take away with them.
listen man, i think i have a problem.
we all have problems.
i'm pissin' fire man.
jesus.  she's got guns.
she's cuban.
they think we're carrying cuban refugees.  skipper, they mean to board us.
not a chance.  remind them that according to the geneva convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
we've got a problem.
what's that?
terry left his passport in curacao. we could hide him...
no.  bring him on deck with the others.
chicken is a fool's game captain.
so is violating international law.
but you invited is aboard.
your cannons made a compelling argument.
stow away?
he left his passport in curacao. it's being mailed to panama.
that is unfortunate.  we'll have to take him with us.
if he's a cuban, castro wears a dress.
nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
what are they doing?
claiming their place in the world.
you okay?
yeah.  how'd you do.
ninety-six.
congratulations.
what about you?
it's a ninety-one!  it's an 'a'!
i know.
you know?  then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
i just can't believe it.
this is your moment, don't you see? the instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again.  when you stand up and are counted.
i couldn't have done it without you.
yes you could.  you did.  this is all you.  nobody else.
feels different doesn't it?
what?
that we're going back.  i don't want it to end.  i don't want to be what i was when i left.
what was that?
anonymous.
i've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  it's what they expect. after all this, i still haven't figured it out.
figured what out?
who i am, outside of this boat. what the hell i'm doing here.
i'll tell you who you are.  you're the glue.  you're the thing that holds everybody around you together. you're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  it's a gift.
you know, i never had friends like this.
me either.
i feel like... we can do anything.
carry on.
yes sir.
north, north-east.  and dick, please make a note of our final position.
where's mom?
i couldn't bring her down here until i knew you were safe.
i thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch.  that sound good?
yeah, sure.
why don't you go and try some of that on?
okay.
fine.
all right.  i'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes...
when we were growing up i always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  but you can't make this okay, can you?
no, i can't.
there are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the albatross.  i have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.
i understand.
may i ask you something?
how'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as francis boutillier?
it wasn't hard.
i used to helm a school ship.  a long time ago.
the coast guard 'eagle'.  she never lost a race while you were skipper.
the families... want your ticket. turn it in, we forget the whole thing.  everybody goes home.
... absolutely not.
the papers are going to eat you alive.  even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  they want someone to be accountable.
i am accountable.
easy for you to say.
what's that supposed to mean?!
everybody knows why she went over tod.  you jibed the boat.
i was trying to get her up wind! that's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
that's not what skipper thought.  he was trying to spill air from the main!
it didn't go over 'til i turned her starboard!
it was an act of god for christ's sake.
can we talk?
i guess.
who is it philip?
it's okay.  i'll be in, in a minute.  look, what do you want?
everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  because of you.
well that's just typical isn't it?
is it true phil?
i gotta go.
you weren't there, you don't know what happened.
i know enough.
why didn't you drop any sail?
skipper called us out of the rigging.
but your instinct was to lose sail?
my instinct was to not get electrocuted.
how old are you, son?
fifteen.
thank you.
is it true that you forced robin weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.
he climbed when he was ready.
were you aware that his brother was killed in a fall.
sir, were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew.
yes, i was.
and you didn't do anything about it?
no.  i didn't.
no.
what makes you so sure it was one?
i can't be sure.
you really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
we'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
except, a "white squall".  with all due respect captain sheldrake, they're only boys...
they are much more than that, sir.
is it true that the reason you expelled philip boutillier...
for killing a dolphin.
... and that you invited him to strike you?  to fight it out on the deck of your ship?!
yes, that's true.
do you think this is funny?  some kind of joke?  you lost six people out there.
i don't think one second of this is funny, sir.
yes.
isn't also true that his vessel went down off of nantucket?  lost everyone on board.  in fair weather no less.
there's still a way.
what do you mean?
it's me, don't you see.  terry's right, i'm the escape hatch.  i disobeyed order.
you taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
they don't know that.  we were the only one's on deck. look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  i'm a kid.
but that's not the point...
that is the point... and skipper'll slip off the hook.
why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
i thought we'd have a better chance if i headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.
but the captain ordered you hard to starboard.
twice.
is that what you were trained to do?
no.
then what do you think he was trying to do.
let the blow drive the boat down wind.  neutralize our canvas.
so when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
no.
if this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
i don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
then what are you trying to say then?
you gonna jump?  or are you just having a last look?
i was just thinking that i never had a new pair of shoes till i was twelve.
it's no my fault i was born first. besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.
it's not a vacation, it's private school.
i thought this was your dream come true.
that's not why he's sending me.
why then.
because it looks good.
i'm just not like you.  ya know? i'm never going to go to yale.  i'm never going to be "william".
nobody says you have to be like me.
he does.
you don't give him enough credit chas.
honey, did you know that the albatross was captured by the germans during world war ii?
no, i didn't.
it says she was originally schooner rigged, but captain sheldrake turned her into a brigantine.  i think square rigs look so much more romantic.
me too.
do you have your ticket?
yes.
passport?
look, i just better go.
goodbye mom.  i'll be okay.
i know you will.
make us proud.
yes sir.
albatross?
yeah.
rick march.  who the hell are you?
gieg, chuck.
look, meet us out front when you're through.  if they try to take anything away from you like johnny quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.
whatever.
what the "bowsprit affair"?
well, romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.
what the hell is going on?
maybe it's an air raid.
i don't.
you will if you wanna eat.  right george?
jesus.
i can't watch this.
what's your problem?
why'd you jump?
because i felt like it.  what do you care?
i couldn't do it.
well, as soon as you grow some balls, let me know.
don't ever call me stupid.
come on, he didn't mean anything.
okay, here's the duty.  gieg, weathers, lapchick, schucart: scrape and paint.  corry and stricklin have the brass.  robinson, you're the galley slave.  march you're on chain gang with barnes. johnston, solo on bilge detail.
butler, what'd i ever do to you?
you came back, tod.  you came back.
albatross?  doesn't inspire a lot of confidence.
oh, on the contrary, the albatross is considered a very good omen.  it is said they embody the spirits of sailors passed on.  it's very bad luck if you kill one.  and dolphins too.
i'm francis boutillier.  this is my son, philip.
i know.
you're a day late.  we keep a schedule aboard ship.  lives depend on it.  hello, philip.
sir.
your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-october.
as you can see, there's a lot to do.
indentured servitude is not what my son had in mind.
this is a working ship.  promptness is not a luxury, it's a necessity, as is the work to maintain her.  had we been ready, i can assure you we would have sailed.
and i would have expected compensation for my time and expense coming all the way down here.
happily, it all worked out... this time.  bill, take philip below and help him find a bunk.
i'll be frank with you.  this was his mother's idea.  a romp through the caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
it will be more than that, i can promise you.
take good care of my son.
we'll do our best.  you're welcome to say goodbye.
he's a big boy.
well, that was neighborly.
he didn't get to be under secretary of the air force by being neighborly.
everyone aboard young bill?
yes, sir.
good.  let's go sailing.
hold her steady into the wind. southwest by west.
yes sir.
gentleman, when you hear an order, sing out.  i want to know that you've heard and understand.  raise the mainsail.
what's wrong mr. lawford.
it seems we're short on singers.
tie it off!!
outer.
we'll bear off to port and run down wind.
mr. lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  rick, get on the jib sheet.  george, john, philip, tim and dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  george will show you what to do.  tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. forecourse first... work upward.
ah... northeast... sir.
speak up boy!
northeast sir!
unfurl the squares!
raise the inner jib!  raise the forestaysail!
watch the tell-tales chuck.  if we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.
yes, sir.
all stop on the engine.
did we lose anybody?
not yet.
that low passed through last night. may be a little bumpy out there.
it's time these boys saw some real blue water.
suicidal...
the first thing is i don't like people talking when i'm talking so the two of you, shut up.
that's not a satisfactory answer.
look, save it for somebody else will ya.  this ancient shit doesn't have anything to do with me.
i'll read it.  i mean i don't mind.
shut up donut.
much have i traveled in realms of gold/ and many goodly states and kingdoms seen/ round many western islands have i been/ which bards in fealty to apollo hold/ oft of one wide expanse had i been told/ that deep-browed homer ruled as his demesne.
you know what he is talking about here?
this isn't just a story!!  it's history made allegory.  it is a philosophical handbook for life!  it holds the secret of this very voyage.
what is it... the secret?
what?
if it were only that simple, my young friend.  read on, gentlemen. read on.
you all right?
it was my fault.  i slipped.
why wasn't i made aware of this bill?
i didn't know sir.
it's your job to know.  if something goes wrong up there, the other eighteen people aboard can't be wondering if he's gonna do his job or not.
swing up, son.
what?
up you go.  right now.
do you have something to say?
no.
then keep your mouth shut.
what's it going to be?
i'm sorry...
sorry won't cut it.
what are you blubbering about?
i don't know...
don't look down.  look in my eyes! climb!  we'll do it together.
i can't.
you climb damn it, or so help me i'll haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!
aaauuuhhh!!!
are you hating this?!  are you!
i hate you, you son of a bitch!!!
no.  hate the fear inside of you! climb like a man mister!  hate it! hate it away.  hate your way up one more rung!!  do it right now!!
no, sir.
excellent.  bill, find mr. weathers a position to suit his condition.
remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.
face what?
i think you were too hard on weathers.
you do?
yes.  i do.
i need to know what i'm working with; what their boundaries are. their lives depend on it, and for that matter so does yours.  we've got to bring them together.  make them a crew.  we're as strong as our weakest link and i don't want to find that out the hard way.  so, i will challenge them and they will come together.
yes sir.
you know the best thing about being a skipper is the worst thing.  it's all my responsibility.  so i'll tell you what george, you stay off of my bridge, and i'll stay out of your galley.  we'll get along that way.
how ya doing?
fine.
good.
look, i appreciate, you know, the concern and all, but like he said, i can take care of myself.
i just brought you something to eat.
i feel like i got you into this.
forget it.
i'm used to spending a lot of time alone.  i guess that's what i thought it would be out here.  but, it's not is it?
i'm sorry i left you hanging up there.
it doesn't matter.  really.  i'm just sorry you got chewed out.
come in.
skipper, uh, the crew is pretty much doing group boot over the side.
well, that's all part of it.
we've got weather moving in from the west.
uh, huh.
would you, um, say it's a big storm?
sometimes it gets exciting out here.
what do you think?
barometer's dropping.  the first blow'll come from the south.  might get interesting.
shouldn't we turn away?
you can't run from the wind son. you trim your sails, face the music and let the chips fall.  bill, let's close her up, dog, tight.
looks like weather.
yep.
do me a favor and tell bill once she's dogged down i want everyone to break out their slickers and make sure their gear is stowed or we'll spend the next week sorting underwear.  lawford, bill, mike, john, and phil will stand the watch.  everyone else hit the racks.
i'm not staying out here.
everyone out of the rigging now!
everybody down!  on the double!!
if you've got "a broad" available i'll take her.
like you'd know what to do with one.
you gotta be kidding?  he's a human chum line!
no self respecting shark is gonna take a bite out of you.
you think skipper and alice do it?
do what?
ya know... "it".
that's like wondering if your mom and dad do it.  who wants to know?
she isn't that old.
what do you mean?
i mean she looks pretty damn good in her all-together for being thirty.
how would you know?
trust me donut.  i know.
what?  come on...
on the dog watch, night after the storm, i look down into the skylight above skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
no way!
come on man, what'd they look like?
damn, porkchop, you sound just like a guy who ain't never seen a pair.
i've seen 'em.  i've seen 'em.
i walked in on my parents one time. it was only like eight o'clock and they were in bed and i thought that was kinda weird so i just walked in.
that's what they get for not locking the door.
so i'm standing there and you could hear a pin drop.  no breathing or snoring... suddenly it hits me that somethin' was goin' on that just stopped, really fast, like people are holding their breath.
so... what happened?
my mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "what?"
what'd you do?
i said "sorry, wrong room" and walked away.
my parents don't do it anymore.
how do you know?  they might.
'cause they're getting a divorce.  that's why they sent me here.  my sister's at tabor.  they just wanted us out of the house so they could get down to business.
they tell you that?
i figured it out.
yeah.
my old man split along time ago.  it doesn't mean anything.  you just take care of number one that's all that matters.
it matters to me.
okay donut.  whatever you say.
where are you from any way?
depths of hell... ohio.  how 'bout you?
kennet square, pa.  'mushroom capital of the world'.
sorry to here it.
well, and it's pretty cool too, ya know?  bein' here together an all...
i have arranged to host a good will cruise for the dutch students of the local school there.
joy, rapture...
each one of you will be responsible for one student.  i'll expect you to be courteous.  you represent this school and your country.  we'll sail in the morning.
hey, shut up will ya?
it was a bad dream...
it was so real...
here's the thing; whenever you're having a nightmare, all you have to do is say 1-2-3 wake up!  you'll be out of it.  you'll wake up.
who told you that?
my dad.
it works?
swear to god.  only good advice he ever gave me.  now, go back to sleep.
that's how he died you know.
who?
my brother.  he fell out of the old beech tree.  broke his neck.  i was on a camp out.  they started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down...  they didn't find him 'till the next morning.  they didn't even know why he was up there.
jesus, you never told them?
i couldn't.
what?!  what's happening?!!
you're officer of the watch, george.
i'm sorry, skip.  it's this damned book.  lawford gave it to me.
son-of-a-bitch.
we're short one long boat too.  come on.
oh i was walkin' down lime street one day...
hey!  weigh!  blow the man down...
a pretty young maiden she happened my way...
give me some time to blow the man down...
i guess we know what the next acquisition for the galley is going to be...
what's that?
a padlock.
so to all you sailors who've fought wind and whale...
weight!  hey!  blow the man down...
she said "none the better, you all go to hell..."
give me some time to blow the man down!
immortality.
spirits have a way of bringing that out.
and being sixteen.
they're in a hurry to grow up.  they don't know about consequences or responsibility.  that's being sixteen too.  i promise you one thing...
what's that?
they'll know about it in the morning.
oh jesus, oh jesus.  man i knew we shouldn't have gone.  i tried to tell you.  i tried to tell you.  you guys made me come!  you made me come!!
will you shut up?  you sound like my fucking sister.
yeah, well you're really gonna have some bad dreams if we find out you didn't.
that's enough.
how the hell are we gonna get outta here?
we'll think of something.
oh, praise the lord.  relax everybody.  everything is under control.  the jug head's going to think of something.
god damn it man.  i think he broke my nose!
shut up, phil.
where you going?
to take a piss.
yeah, that's right.  you wanna come in and shake it for me?
if you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
you've gotta be kidding.  get the fuck outta my way!
why, man?
i don't have to listen to this.
i cheated to get on the boat!!!  all right?!
what?
i doctored my grades so i'd make the cut.  i'm a moron, okay?  you satisfied?!
you're not a moron.
wanna bet?  takes me half a day to get through one chapter of lawford and i still don't have any idea what the hell he's talkin' about.  you know why it takes me so long to write papers?  because i can't spell.  while everybody else is sleeping, i'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary.
hell, they even kicked me outa vo- tech 'cause i couldn't read a slide rule.
i can show you how to use a slide rule.
how long you been standing there?
long enough.
they were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  i stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. shit, who am i kidding.  i'll never pass the boards.
listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  we'll start a private study group.  nobody knows.  you'll ace that test.
me, too.
why would you do that?
what are they doing?
i can't make it out?
they're waving... handkerchiefs or something.
what?
what are we supposed to talk about?
you've gotta be kidding?
but, they don't speak english.
there are some things that everybody does in the same language.
yeah, but how are you supposed to make the first move?
like this!
well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.
and, of course, we are.
well, you never can tell these days, can you?
what is it we can do for you today?
well, we've come to give our boy a little break from the monotony.
bregitta.  do you believe it?
believe what?
her name.  bregitta.  it's poetry.
soon as we ship it'll be "forgetta".
don't mind him, chucky.  you're talking to a guy whose idea of big romance is a palm full of vaseline.
screw you, valentino.  i haven't seen you swapping spit with anybody.
what's wrong, you don't like steak?
i should be eating with the crew.
humor me.  eat it anyway.
why are you here?
spying?!
i can take care of myself.
oh, really?
look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  i didn't want to come but i did.  why do you have to embarrass me.  why can't you just leave me alone?
listen to me, you thankless little prick.  we're your parents, so don't you dare talk to me disrespectfully. what the hell is it, this captain? because i'll see him in a rowboat...
it has nothing to do with him.
well, what does it have to do with? us?
no.  look, it's me okay?  can't it just be about me?  for once?
he would have loved this.
your father?
all his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
you miss him.
i'd have liked to have said goodbye.
he knows.
you sound so sure.
i am about this.
what?
he never would have believed a woman like you existed.
do you remember the last time you and i danced under the stars?
guilty.
on the deck of the yankee, the night you asked me to marry you.  we weren't much older than they are.
phil.  what are you doing?
fandango, junior.  i'm gonna do some limbo baby!!
no way phil.  not like this.
roger meris, steps up, it's a corker down the pipe...
it's outta here!
come on man.  let's just talk about it.
jesus!  what the hell happened to him.
lemme go!  lemme go!!
i don't know.  we gotta get 'im outta here before skipper sees him like this.
son of a bitch!!
the rust won't wait for you to read conrad, goodall.
then he shouldn't have written such a long poem, mr. lawford.
read on, young john.  read on. college boards are coming.
fuck off man.  it's just a fish.
no, phil.  it's a mammal.
i'm not gonna kill it.
you already have.  now go on.  do it.
why'd you do it?
what's the difference?
you only hurt yourself you know?
like you really care.  like any of you give a shit what happens to me.
you're the one who doesn't care, phil.
it hurts too much to care.
about yourself?
about anything.
i can't go in there.
what are you talking about.
what's on your mind?
i'm here on behalf of the crew, sir.
well, spit it out.
the fact is... we'd like you to give phil another chance.
can't do it.
sir...?
close the door.  sit down.
why do you think i'm sending him home?
he killed the dolphin.
the dolphin was a symptom.
of what?
of a fight he can't win out here.
it's his father sir.  he's suffocating him.  we've all seen it...
i mean he has all these expectations and he doesn't even know who his own kid is.  what right did then have to show up here?
they have every right chuck.
they send us because they want us to change, or grow up or something and then they try to keep us the same.
does phil know how you guys feel?
i don't know.
you should tell him.  that's something he can take with him.
you may not like what you hear.
i can take it.
they've become what you wanted. they're a crew.  that's why he came.
why did we begin this?
we were idealists.
because we believed we could make an impact out here.  self reliance and community through the disciplines of sailing.
i haven't forgotten.
phil, he's not looking inside.  he's just striking out at the world.
he has a lot of hurt inside him.
well, he better learn to own it. actions have consequences.  it's not what happens here alice, it's what they take away with them.
listen man, i think i have a problem.
we all have problems.
i'm pissin' fire man.
jesus.  she's got guns.
she's cuban.
they think we're carrying cuban refugees.  skipper, they mean to board us.
not a chance.  remind them that according to the geneva convention, firing on a civilian vessel on the high sea is an act of war.
we've got a problem.
what's that?
terry left his passport in curacao. we could hide him...
no.  bring him on deck with the others.
chicken is a fool's game captain.
so is violating international law.
but you invited is aboard.
your cannons made a compelling argument.
stow away?
he left his passport in curacao. it's being mailed to panama.
that is unfortunate.  we'll have to take him with us.
if he's a cuban, castro wears a dress.
nobody aboard my ship is going anywhere.
what are they doing?
claiming their place in the world.
you okay?
yeah.  how'd you do.
ninety-six.
congratulations.
what about you?
it's a ninety-one!  it's an 'a'!
i know.
you know?  then why are you up here looking like you're about to jump overboard?!
i just can't believe it.
this is your moment, don't you see? the instant when you know that your life is never going to be the same again.  when you stand up and are counted.
i couldn't have done it without you.
yes you could.  you did.  this is all you.  nobody else.
feels different doesn't it?
what?
that we're going back.  i don't want it to end.  i don't want to be what i was when i left.
what was that?
anonymous.
i've been getting ninety-sixes my whole life.  it's what they expect. after all this, i still haven't figured it out.
figured what out?
who i am, outside of this boat. what the hell i'm doing here.
i'll tell you who you are.  you're the glue.  you're the thing that holds everybody around you together. you're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  it's a gift.
you know, i never had friends like this.
me either.
i feel like... we can do anything.
carry on.
yes sir.
north, north-east.  and dick, please make a note of our final position.
where's mom?
i couldn't bring her down here until i knew you were safe.
i thought we'd find a store, get you fixed up and then get you some lunch.  that sound good?
yeah, sure.
why don't you go and try some of that on?
okay.
fine.
all right.  i'm gonna wander over and look at some shoes...
when we were growing up i always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  but you can't make this okay, can you?
no, i can't.
there are allegations questioning your competence with regard to the command of the albatross.  i have been instructed to convene a formal tribunal to determine whether or not negligence played a part in the sinking.
i understand.
may i ask you something?
how'd you manage to piss off a guy as powerful as francis boutillier?
it wasn't hard.
i used to helm a school ship.  a long time ago.
the coast guard 'eagle'.  she never lost a race while you were skipper.
the families... want your ticket. turn it in, we forget the whole thing.  everybody goes home.
... absolutely not.
the papers are going to eat you alive.  even if you beat it, you'll never get another commission.  they want someone to be accountable.
i am accountable.
easy for you to say.
what's that supposed to mean?!
everybody knows why she went over tod.  you jibed the boat.
i was trying to get her up wind! that's what you do when you're hit a-beam.  or maybe you're too stupid to know that!
that's not what skipper thought.  he was trying to spill air from the main!
it didn't go over 'til i turned her starboard!
it was an act of god for christ's sake.
can we talk?
i guess.
who is it philip?
it's okay.  i'll be in, in a minute.  look, what do you want?
everybody's saying this whole tribunal is happening because of your father.  because of you.
well that's just typical isn't it?
is it true phil?
i gotta go.
you weren't there, you don't know what happened.
i know enough.
why didn't you drop any sail?
skipper called us out of the rigging.
but your instinct was to lose sail?
my instinct was to not get electrocuted.
how old are you, son?
fifteen.
thank you.
is it true that you forced robin weathers to climb the mast when it was clear that he was acrophobic.
he climbed when he was ready.
were you aware that his brother was killed in a fall.
sir, were you aware at any time of the use of alcohol among the crew.
yes, i was.
and you didn't do anything about it?
no.  i didn't.
no.
what makes you so sure it was one?
i can't be sure.
you really felt that your crew were up for the conditions.
we'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
except, a "white squall".  with all due respect captain sheldrake, they're only boys...
they are much more than that, sir.
is it true that the reason you expelled philip boutillier...
for killing a dolphin.
... and that you invited him to strike you?  to fight it out on the deck of your ship?!
yes, that's true.
do you think this is funny?  some kind of joke?  you lost six people out there.
i don't think one second of this is funny, sir.
yes.
isn't also true that his vessel went down off of nantucket?  lost everyone on board.  in fair weather no less.
there's still a way.
what do you mean?
it's me, don't you see.  terry's right, i'm the escape hatch.  i disobeyed order.
you taking the order wouldn't have changed anything.
they don't know that.  we were the only one's on deck. look, there's nothing they can do to me right?  i'm a kid.
but that's not the point...
that is the point... and skipper'll slip off the hook.
why didn't you turn hard to port as the wind hit?
i thought we'd have a better chance if i headed into the wind so we could spill air from our sails.
but the captain ordered you hard to starboard.
twice.
is that what you were trained to do?
no.
then what do you think he was trying to do.
let the blow drive the boat down wind.  neutralize our canvas.
so when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?
no.
if this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?
i don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.
then what are you trying to say then?
