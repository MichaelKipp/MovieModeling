and how are we today?
terrible.
just terrible?  that is better than yesterday at least.
how long have i been on gateway station?
just a couple of days.  do you feel up to a visitor?
fifty-seven...oh, christ...
you would drifted right through the core systems.  it is blind luck that deep-salvage team caught you when they...are you all right?
bad dreams again?  do you want something to help you sleep?
no.. I have slept enough.
have they located my daughter yet?
well, i was going to wait until after the inquest...
is she...?
amanda ripley-mcclaren.  married name, i guess.  age:  sixty-six ...at time of death.  two years ago.  I am sorry.
amy.
cancer.  hmmmm.  they still have not licked that one.  cremated.  interred parkside repository, little chute, wisconsin.  no children.
you read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
look, i believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  you got feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
i get the picture.
just tell them what happened.  the important thing is to stay cool and unemotional.
look, i told you...
it did not, however, contain any entries concerning the hostile life form you allegedly picked up.
the analysis team which went over your shuttle centimeter by centimeter found no physical evidence of the creature you describe...
that is because i blew it out the goddamn airlock!  like i said.
look, i can see where this is going.  but I am telling you those things exist.  back on that planetoid is an alien ship and on that ship are thousands of eggs.  thousands. do you understand?  i suggest you find it, using the flight recorder's data.  find it and deal with it -- before one of your survey teams comes back with a little surprise...
thank you, officer ripley.  that will be...
...because just one of those things managed to kill my entire crew, within twelve hours of hatching...
you had them eating out of your hand, kiddo.
they had their minds made up before i even went in there. they think I am a head case.
you are a head case.  have a donut.
why will not you check out lv-426?
because i do not have to.  the people who live there checked it out years ago and they never reported and 'hostile organism' or alien ship.  and by the way, they call it acheron now.
what are you talking about. what people?
how many colonists?
sixty, maybe seventy families.
sweet jesus.
you remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the ilium range, a couple days ago?
yeah.  what?
there is a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team.  says he is homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
christ.  some honch in a cushy office on earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look.  they do not say why, and i do not ask.  i do not ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
so what do i tell this guy?
tell him, as far as I am concerned, he finds something it is his.
no.  there is no way!
hear me out...
i was reamed, steamed and dry-cleaned by you guys...and now you want me to go back out there?  forget it.
look, we do not know what is going on out there.  it may just be a down transmitter.  but if it is not, i want you there...as an advisor.  that is all.
you would not be going in with the troops.  i can guarantee your safety.
these colonial marines are some tough hombres, and they are packing state-of-the-art firepower. nothing they can not handle...right, lieutenant?
we are trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
what about you?  what is your interest in this?
well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the colonial administration, against mineral rights.  we are getting into a lot of terraforming...'building better worlds.'
yeah, yeah.  i saw the commercial.
i heard you were working in the cargo docks.
that is right.
running loaders, forklifts, that sort of thing?
it is all i could get.  anyway, it keeps my mind off of... everything.  days off are worse.
what if i said i could get you reinstated as a flight officer? and that the company has agreed to pick up your contract?
if i go.
if you go.  it is a second chance, kiddo.  and it will be the best thing in the world for you to face this fear and beat it.  you got to get back on the horse...
spare me, burke.  I have had my psych evaluation this month.
yes, and I have read it.  you wake up every night, sheets soaking, the same nightmare over and over...
no!  the answer is no.  now please go.  I am sorry.  just go, would you.
yello?  oh, ripley.  hi...
burke, just tell me one thing. that you are going out there to kill them.  not study.  not bring back.  just burn them out...clean ...forever.
that is the plan.  my word on it.
this floor's freezing.
christ.  i never saw such a buncha old women.  you want me to fetch your slippers, hudson?
would you, sir?
hey, vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?
no.  have you?
whoooah!  no shit?  I am impressed.
let's go...let's go.  cycle through!
hey, 'top.'  what is the op?
rescue mission.  there is some juicy colonists' daughters we got to rescue from virginity.
you never said anything about an android being here!  why not?
well, it did not occur to me.  it is been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
at ease.  I am sorry we did not have time to brief before we left gateway but...
sir?
yes, hicks?
hudson, sir.  he is hicks.
what is the question?
is this going to be a stand-up fight, sir, on another bug-hunt?
all we know is that there is still no contact with the colony and that a xenomorph may be involved.
sounds like you, hicks.
the embryo, the second form, hosts in the victim's body for several hours.  gestating.  then it...  ...then it...emerges.  moults. grows rapidly --
somebody said alien...she thought they said illegal alien and signed up.
fuck you.
anytime.  anywhere.
i hope you are right.  i really do.
i suggest you study the disks ripley has been kind enough to prepare for you.
are there any questions?  hudson?
how do i get out of this chicken-shit outfit?
still nothing from the colony?
dead on all channels.
save it.
sure, hicks.
how may drops is this for you, lieutenant?
thirty-eight...simulated.
...that's better.  pan it around a bit.
awright.  fire-team a.  gear up. let's move.  two minutes. somebody wake up hicks.
that the atmosphere processor?
uh-hunh.  one of thirty or so, all over the planet.  they are completely automated.  we manufacture them, by the way.
hold at forty.  slow circle of the complex.
the structure seems intact.  they have power.
okay, let's do it.
awright!  i want a nice clean dispersal this time.
set down sixty meters this side of the telemetry mast.  immediate dust off on my 'clear,' then stay on station.
ten seconds, people.  look sharp!
first squad up, on line.  hicks, get yours in a cordon.  watch the rear.
vasquez, take point.  let's move.
all right, the area's secured. let's go in and see what their computer can tell us.  first team head for operations. hudson, see if you can get their cpu on line.  hicks, meet me at the south lock by the up-link tower...
...we're coming in.
he is coming in.  i feel safer already.
sir, the cpu is on-line.
okay, stand by in operations.  let's go.
looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
it is insured.
removed surgically before embryo implantation.  subject:  marachuk, john l.   died during procedure.  they killed him getting it off.
poor bastard.
one of us?
apone...where are your people? anybody in d-block?
where are your parents?  you have to try...
gorman!  give it a rest would you.
what is he scanning for?
pdt's.  personal-data transmitters. every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
what did you say?
newt.  my n-name's newt. nobody calls me rebecca except my dork brother.
casey.  she is my only friend.
what about me?
i do not want you for a friend.
why not?
because you will be gone soon, like the others.  like everybody.  you will be dead and you will leave me alone.
they would be here if they could, honey.  i know they would.
they are dead.
newt.  look at me...newt.  i will not leave you.  i promise.
you promise?
cross my heart.
and hope to die?
hah!  stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  found 'em.
alive?
unknown.  but, it looks like all of them.  over at the processing station...sublevel 'c' under the south tower.
i was the best at the game. i knew the whole maze.
the 'maze'?  you mean the air ducts?
yeah, you know.  in the walls, under the floor.  i was the ace.  i could hide better than anybody.
you are really something, ace.
we are not making that out too well.  what is it?
you tell me.  i only work here.
what is it?
i do not know.
proceed inside.
they are right under the primary heat exchangers.
yeah?  maybe the organisms like the heat, that is why they built...
that is not what i mean.  gorman, if your men have to use their weapons in there, they will rupture the cooling system.
she is right.
so.
so...then the fusion containment shuts down.
so?  so?
we are talking thermonuclear explosion.
shit.  apone, collect magazines from everybody.  we can not have any firing in there.
flame-units only.  i want rifles slung.
let's go.  pull 'em out.
movement!
position?
can not lock up...
talk to me, hudson.
uh, seems to be in front and behind.
let's get the fuck out of here!
not that tunnel, the other one!
get them out of there!  do it now!
shut up.  just shut up!
uh,...apone, i want you to lay down a suppressing fire with the incinerators and fall back by squads to the apc, over.
say again?  all after incinerators?
i told them to fall back...
they are but off!  do something!
looks like it stung him.
hey...hey!  look, crowe and dietrich are not dead, man.
you can not help them.  right now they are being cocooned just like the others.
oh, god.  jesus.  this am not happening.
all right, we can not blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of cn-20 down there. nerve gas the whole nest?
look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?
no good.  how do we know it will effect their biochemistry?  i say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit.  it is the only way to be sure.
now hold on a second.  I am not authorizing that action.
why not?
well, i mean...i know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments.  let's move cautiously.  first, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it --
they can bill me.  i got a tab running.  what is second?
this is clearly an important species we are dealing with here. we can not just arbitrarily exterminate them --
bullshit!
yeah, bullshit.  watch us.
maybe you have not been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!
you son of a bitch.
do not make me pull rank, ripley.
what rank?  i believe corporal hicks has authority here.
corporal hicks!?
this operation is under military jurisdiction and hicks is next in chain of command.  right?
well that is great!  that is just fucking great, man.  now what the fuck are we supposed to do, man? we are in some real pretty shit now!
are you finished?  you okay?
i guess we are not leaving, right?
I am sorry, newt.
you do not have to be sorry.  it was not your fault.
how long after we are declared overdue can we expect a rescue?
about seventeen days.
man, we are not going to make it seventeen hours!  those things are going to come in here, just like they did before, man... they are going to come in here and get us, man, long before...
she survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.
this service tunnel is how they are moving back and forth.
yeah, right, it runs from the processing station right into the sublevel here.
all right.  there is a fire door at this end.  the first thing we do is put a remote sentry in the tunnel and seal that door.
we gotta figure on them getting into the complex.
that is right.  so we put up welded barricades at these intersections...  ...and seal these ducts here and here.  then they can only come at us from these two corridors and we create a free field of fire for the other two sentry units, here.
outstanding.  then all we need's a deck of cards.  all right, let's move like we got a purpose.
aye-firmative.
thanks.
uh, what is next?
now you just lie here and have a nap.  you are exhausted.
i do not want to...i have scary dreams.
ripley...she does not have bad dreams because she is just a piece of plastic.
oh.  sorry, newt.
my mommy always said there were no monsters.  no real ones.  but there are.
yes, there are, are not there.
why do they tell little kids that?
well, some kids can not handle it like you can.
did one of those things grow inside her?
i do not know, newt.  that is the truth.
is not that how babies come? i mean people babies...they grow inside you?
no, it is different, honey.
did you ever have a baby?
yes.  a little girl.
where is she?
gone.
you mean dead.
do not go!  please.
I will be right in the other room, newt.  and look...i can see you on that camera right up there.
I have isolated a neuro-muscular toxin responsible for the paralysis.  it seems to be metabolizing.  he should wake up soon.
now let me get this straight. the aliens paralyzed the colonists, carried them over there, cocooned them to be hosts for more of those...
which would mean lots of those parasites, right?  one for each person...over a hundred at least.
yes.  that follows.
but these things come from eggs...so where are all the eggs coming from.
that is the question of the hour.  we could assume a parallel to certain insect forms who have hivelike organization. an ant of termite colony, for example, is ruled by a single female, a queen, which is the source of new eggs.
you are saying one of those things lays all the eggs?
well, the queen is always physically larger then the others.  a termite queen's abdomen is so bloated with eggs that it can not move at all.  it is fed and tended by drone workers, defended by the warriors.  she is the center of their lives, quite literally the  mother of their society.
could it be intelligent?
hard to say.  it may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we could not destroy her without destroying ourselves.  that is if she exists, of course.
those specimens are worth millions to the bio-weapons division.  now, if you are smart we can both come out of this heroes.  set up for life.
you just try getting a dangerous organism past icc quarantine. section 22350 of the commerce code.
you have been doing your homework. look, they can not impound it if they do not know about it.
but they will know about it, burke. from me.  just like they will know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
now, wait a second --
you sent them to that ship.  i just checked the colony log... directive dates six-twelve-seventy-nine. signed burke, carter j.
you sent them out there and you did not even warn them, burke. why did not you warn them?
look, maybe the thing did not even exist, right?  and if I would made it a major security situation, the administration would have stepped in.  then no exclusive rights, nothing.
i expected more of you, ripley. i thought you would be smarter than this.
sorry to disappoint you.
that is it.  see it?  emergency venting.
how long until it blows?
I am projecting total systems failure in a little under four hours.  the blast radius will be about thirty kilometers.  about equal to ten megatons.
we got problems.
i do not fucking believe this. do you believe this?
and it is too late to shut it down?
I am afraid so.  the crash did too much damage.  the overload is inevitable, at this point.
oh, man.  and i was gettin' short, too!  four more weeks and out. now I am going to buy it on this fuckin' rock.  it am not half fair, man!
hudson, give us a break.
we need the other drop-ship.  the on one the sulaco.  we have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
how?  the transmitter was on the apc.  it is wasted.
i do not care how!  think of a way.  think of something.
think of what?  we are fucked.
what about the colony transmitter? that up-link tower down at the other end.  why can not we use that?
well then somebody is just going to have to go out there.  take a portable terminal and go out there and plug in manually.
oh, right!  right!  with those things running around.  no way.
I will go.
what?
I am really the only one qualified to remote-pilot the ship anyway. believe me, I would prefer not to.  i may be synthetic but I am not stupid.
all right.  let's get on it.  what will you need?
it is going to be closer.  you better get going.
see you soon.
they are in the approach corridor.
on my way.
now many?
can not tell.  lots.  d gun's down to twenty.  ten.  it is out.
newt time then can walk right up and knock.
but they do not know that.  they are probably looking for other ways to get in.  that will take them awhile.
maybe we got 'em demoralized.
i want you two walking the perimeter. i know we are all in strung out shape but stay frosty and alert. we have got to stop any entries before they get out of hand.
they will get us.
maybe.  maybe not.
hicks, I am not going to wind up like those others.  you will take care of it will not you, it if comes to that?
if it comes to that, I will do us both.  let's see that it does not here, I would like to introduce you to a close personal friend of mine.
what is this?
well, that is the grenade launcher ...you probably do not want to mess with that.
look, you started this.  now show me everything.  i can handle myself.
yeah.  I have noticed.
how do you feel?
all right, i guess.  one hell of a hangover.  look, ripley... i...
forget it.
newt.  newt, wake up.
wah...?  where are...?
sssh.  do not move.  we are in trouble.
mommy...i mean, ripley...i'm scared.
i know, honey.  me too.
the corner!  ready?
do it!
wait a minute.  we would know about it.
the only way it would work is if he sabotaged certain freezers on the trip back.  then he could jettison the bodies and make up any story he liked.
you know, burke, i do not know which species is worse.  you do not see them screwing each other over for a fucking percentage.
let's waste him.  no offense.
they cut the power.
what do you mean, they cut the power?  how could they cut the power, man?  they are animals.
it is inside the complex.
you are just reading me.
no.  no!  it am not you.  they are inside.  inside the perimeter. they are in here.
it is game time.
get back here, both of you.  fall back to operations.
this signal's weird...must be some interference or something. there is movement all over the place...
just get back here!
range twenty meters.
seal the door.
seventeen meters.
let's get these things lit.
they learned.  they cut the power and avoided the guns.  they must have found another way in, something we missed.
we did not miss anything.
fifteen meters.
i do not know, an acid hole in a duct.  something under the floors, not on the plans. i do not know!
twelve meters.  man, this is a big fucking signal.  ten meters.
they are right on us.  vasquez, how you doing?
nine meters.  eight.
can not be.  that is inside the room!
it is readin' right.  look!
well you are not reading it right!
six meters.  five.  what the fu --
burke!  open the door!
look!
let's go!  let's go!
fuckin' a!
locked.
stand back.
come on.  crawl faster.
do you know how to get to the landing field from here?
sure.  go left.
this way.  come on, we are almost there!
newt, wait!
no!  no!  she is alive!  we have to --
all right!  she is alive.  i believe it.  but we got to get moving!  now!
how much time?
plenty!  twenty-six minutes!
we are not leaving!
ripley...
she is alive.  they brought her here and you know it.
in seventeen minutes this place will be a cloud of vapor the size of nebraska.
hicks, do not let him leave.
we am not going anywhere.
ellen.
do not be long, ellen.
i knew you would come.
newt, i want you to hang on, now.  hang on tight.
you did okay, bishop.
well, thanks, i --
mommy...mommy?
right here, baby.  right here.
are we going to sleep now?
that is right.
can we dream?
yes, honey.  i think we both can.
