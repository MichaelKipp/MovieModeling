you are looking well, dutch.
it is been a long time, general.
that is over the border, general.
that is the problem. apparently they strayed off course.  we are certain they have been captured by the guerrillas.
what have you got in mind, general.
we figure we have got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. after that, there is not much hope. we want a rescue operation mounted tonight. that does not give you much time.
you lift off in three hours.  there is one other thing.
what is that, general?
someone else will be going in with you.
you have been pushing too many pencils, dillon. had enough?
no way, old buddy.
you never did know when to quit.
that piece of work you guys pulled off at the berlin embassy last week was really something. blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. beautiful.
like the old days, dillon.
also heard that you passed on that little job in libya.
was not my style. we are a rescue unit, not assassins.  this must be good. big shot from the cia, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. what is so important?
those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. they are about to get squeezed. we can not let that happen. i needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. i needed the best. the best. so, i pulled a few strings at the state department... and here we are.
go on.
our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. awacs contact on four hour intervals.
who is our back-up on this?
no such thing, old buddy. it is a one way ticket. once we cross that border, we are on our own.
this gets better by the minute.
you do not know how much i missed this, dutch!!! once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
you never were all that smart... let's go!!!
took 'em out with a heat seeker.
there is something else, major...
mmmnnn...?
i do not think that was any ordinary army taxi...
billy's on it.  heat seeker. pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
they are getting better equipped every day.
major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  then a different set of track, over there.
what do you mean?
six others, u.s. issue jungle boots. they came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.
mean anything to you?
probably another rebel patrol. they operate in here all the time.
what is he got?
same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with american equipment...
i knew this man. green berets, out of fort bragg. what the hell were they doing in here? you got any answers for this, dillon?
jesus... this is inhuman.  uh... i was not told of any operations in this area. they should not have been here.
well somebody sent them.
strange, major. there was a firefight. shooting in all directions.
i can not believe jim hopper walked into an ambush.
i do not believe he did, sir. i could not find a single track. just does not make sense.
what about the rest of hopper's men?
any sign of the hostages?
we found 'em both, dead. and the gear from the chopper. if they are central american, I am a fuckin' chinaman. by the looks of 'em, I would say our cabinet minister and his aide are cia.  another thing, major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are russians, military advisors by the look of it. something big was about to happen here.
it was all bullshit. all of it. from the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
that is right, i set you up. you are a veteran at this, dutch, i had to.
why us?
because i told you, you are the best. i knew you could do it but i could not get you in here without a cover story.
what story did you give to davis?
we have been lookin' for this place for months. the chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. hopper was sent in to get my men. he was just doing his job. when he disappeared i had to clean this up, i had to stop there bastards. we were so close, we could not quit. we could not sleep through this one. i needed you, dutch, can not you see that?
she is too valuable. she is got to know their whole network. the whole set up. we take her with us.
we take her and she will give away our position, every chance she gets. no prisoners, dillon.
thanks.
anytime.
what is got billy so spooked?
can not say, major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes i think that nose of his is too good... smells things that am not there.
billy... what the hell's wrong with you?
something... in the trees...
major, you would better take a look at this.
hawkins?
i can not tell.
what in god's name...?
i think it is hawkins.
where the hell is his body?
there is no sign of it.
you saw what?
i saw it.
blain...  ... just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
the wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. we will bury him in the morning.
I will take him.
we have got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
thank you, sergeant.
I am sorry, bull. it is never easy. he was a good soldier.
the best friend i ever had.
we are still too far in, they will not risk coming in for us.
expendable assets, dillon. seems langley is never around when you need them.
i can accept that, it comes with the job.
bullshit. you are just like the rest of us.
do not know, only saw one of 'em. camouflaged. he was there...  ... those fucking eyes...
what, sergeant?
those eyes... disappeared. but i know one thing, major...  ... i drew down and fired right at it. capped-off two hundred rounds and then the mini-gun; the full pack. nothin'... nothin' on this earth could have lived... not at that range.
how could anyone get through this, carry blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
he knows our defenses.
why did not he try to kill one of us last night?
you are wastin' your time.
no more games.
what the hell do you think you are doing?
we are going to need everyone.
what are you talking about? we will be out of here in ten minutes.
we are not going.
that rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles, at most! we are almost home. but the chopper will not wait.
he will be looking for the trip wires. if we are lucky, he will not see this.
now what, dutch. you going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
no way, dutch. I am going. you get these people and get the hell out of here.
this is not your style, dillon.
guess I have picked up some bad habits from you, dutch. now do not argue with me, you know I am right. get to that chopper and hold it for us. we will be along.
you know you can not win this one.
I will see you there.
right behind you.
take a position over there. I will work around towards you. when i flush him, you nail him...
... right, i got a score to settle for the bro...
we both got scores to settle.
