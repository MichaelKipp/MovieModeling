you're looking well, dutch.
it's been a long time, general.
that's over the border, general.
that's the problem. apparently they strayed off course.  we're certain they've been captured by the guerrillas.
what have you got in mind, general.
we figure we've got less than twenty-four hours to catch up with them. after that, there's not much hope. we want a rescue operation mounted tonight. that doesn't give you much time.
you lift off in three hours.  there's one other thing.
what's that, general?
someone else will be going in with you.
you've been pushing too many pencils, dillon. had enough?
no way, old buddy.
you never did know when to quit.
that piece of work you guys pulled off at the berlin embassy last week was really something. blew the entry points on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat. beautiful.
like the old days, dillon.
also heard that you passed on that little job in libya.
wasn't my style. we're a rescue unit, not assassins.  this must be good. big shot from the cia, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. what's so important?
those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world. they're about to get squeezed. we can't let that happen. i needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet... no screw-ups. i needed the best. the best. so, i pulled a few strings at the state department... and here we are.
go on.
our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are indicated and fixed. awacs contact on four hour intervals.
who's our back-up on this?
no such thing, old buddy. it's a one way ticket. once we cross that border, we're on our own.
this gets better by the minute.
you don't know how much i missed this, dutch!!! once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!
you never were all that smart... let's go!!!
took 'em out with a heat seeker.
there's something else, major...
mmmnnn...?
i don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...
billy's on it.  heat seeker. pretty sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.
they're getting better equipped every day.
major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.  then a different set of track, over there.
what do you mean?
six others, u.s. issue jungle boots. they came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.
mean anything to you?
probably another rebel patrol. they operate in here all the time.
what's he got?
same business, guerrillas hauling two guys from the chopper... followed by men with american equipment...
i knew this man. green berets, out of fort bragg. what the hell were they doing in here? you got any answers for this, dillon?
jesus... this is inhuman.  uh... i wasn't told of any operations in this area. they shouldn't have been here.
well somebody sent them.
strange, major. there was a firefight. shooting in all directions.
i can't believe jim hopper walked into an ambush.
i don't believe he did, sir. i couldn't find a single track. just doesn't make sense.
what about the rest of hopper's men?
any sign of the hostages?
we found 'em both, dead. and the gear from the chopper. if they're central american, i'm a fuckin' chinaman. by the looks of 'em, i'd say our cabinet minister and his aide are cia.  another thing, major, we were lucky... couple of those guys we waxed are russians, military advisors by the look of it. something big was about to happen here.
it was all bullshit. all of it. from the start... you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.
that's right, i set you up. you're a veteran at this, dutch, i had to.
why us?
because i told you, you're the best. i knew you could do it but i couldn't get you in here without a cover story.
what story did you give to davis?
we've been lookin' for this place for months. the chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. hopper was sent in to get my men. he was just doing his job. when he disappeared i had to clean this up, i had to stop there bastards. we were so close, we couldn't quit. we couldn't sleep through this one. i needed you, dutch, can't you see that?
she's too valuable. she's got to know their whole network. the whole set up. we take her with us.
we take her and she'll give away our position, every chance she gets. no prisoners, dillon.
thanks.
anytime.
what's got billy so spooked?
can't say, major... been squirrely all mornin'... fuckin' weird... sometimes i think that nose of his is too good... smells things that ain't there.
billy... what the hell's wrong with you?
something... in the trees...
major, you'd better take a look at this.
hawkins?
i can't tell.
what in god's name...?
i think it's hawkins.
where the hell is his body?
there's no sign of it.
you saw what?
i saw it.
blain...  ... just like the others... no powder burns, no shrapnel.
the wound all fused, cauterized... what the hell did this?
put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. we'll bury him in the morning.
i'll take him.
we've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside. nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'.
thank you, sergeant.
i'm sorry, bull. it's never easy. he was a good soldier.
the best friend i ever had.
we're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
expendable assets, dillon. seems langley is never around when you need them.
i can accept that, it comes with the job.
bullshit. you're just like the rest of us.
don't know, only saw one of 'em. camouflaged. he was there...  ... those fucking eyes...
what, sergeant?
those eyes... disappeared. but i know one thing, major...  ... i drew down and fired right at it. capped-off two hundred rounds and then the mini-gun; the full pack. nothin'... nothin' on this earth could have lived... not at that range.
how could anyone get through this, carry blain out, right under our noses without leavin' a trace?
he knows our defenses.
why didn't he try to kill one of us last night?
you're wastin' your time.
no more games.
what the hell do you think you're doing?
we're going to need everyone.
what are you talking about? we'll be out of here in ten minutes.
we're not going.
that rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles, at most! we're almost home. but the chopper won't wait.
he'll be looking for the trip wires. if we're lucky, he won't see this.
now what, dutch. you going to send your mystery guest an invitation?
no way, dutch. i'm going. you get these people and get the hell out of here.
this isn't your style, dillon.
guess i've picked up some bad habits from you, dutch. now don't argue with me, you know i'm right. get to that chopper and hold it for us. we'll be along.
you know you can't win this one.
i'll see you there.
right behind you.
take a position over there. i'll work around towards you. when i flush him, you nail him...
... right, i got a score to settle for the bro...
we both got scores to settle.
