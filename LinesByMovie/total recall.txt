i love you.
i love you.
is that better?
mmmm.....
poor baby.  this is getting to be an obsession.
who?
the brunette.  the one you told me about.
lori, i don't believe it...you're jealous of a dream!
who is she?
nobody.
nobody?!  what's her name?
i don't know.
tell me!
it's not funny, doug.  you dream about her every night.
but i'm always home by morning.
let me go!
aw, come on, baby...you're the girl of my dreams.
...you mean it?
you know i do.
lori...
yeah, sweetheart?
let's do it.
do what?
move to mars.
honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
just think about it.
sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  you'd hate it on mars. it's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --i mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
and you believe him?
all right, forget about it.
doug, maybe we should take a trip.
lori, move.
there's lots nicer places than mars.
well...what do you say?
i'm late.
sweetheart...i know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  okay?
lori, don't you understand?  i feel i was meant for something more than this.  i want to do something with my life.--i want to be somebody.
you are somebody.  you're the man i love.
bye.
hey harry...harry!  you ever heard of rekall?
rekall?
they sell fake memories.
oh, rekall.
yeah.
"rekallrekallrekall."  you thinkin' of goin' there?
i don't know.  maybe.
well don't.
why not?
a friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...nearly got himself lobotomized.
no shit...
don't fuck with your brain, pal.  it ain't worth it.
doug...bob mcclane.
nice to meet you.
good to see ya. right this way.
now help me out here, doug.  you were interested in a memory of...
mars.
right.  mars.
that a problem?
to be perfectly honest with you, doug, if outer space is your thing, i think you'd be much happier  with one of our saturn cruises.everybody raves about 'em.
i'm not interested in saturn.  i said mars.
okay, you're the boss -- mars it is.
let's see...the basic mars package will run you just eight hundred and ninety-nine credits.  that's for two full weeks of memories, complete in every detail.  --a longer trip'll run you a little more, cause you need a deeper implant.
what's in the two week package?
first of all, doug, when you go rekall, you get nothing but first class memories: private cabin on the shuttle; deluxe suite at the hilton; plus all the major sights:  mount pyramid, the grand canals, and of course...  venusville.
how real does it seem?
as real as any memory in your head.
come on, don't bullshit me.
i'm telling you, doug, your brain won't know the difference.  guaranteed, or your money back.
what about the guy you lobotomized...did he get a refund?
you're talking ancient history, doug. nowadays, traveling with rekall is safer than getting on a rocket.  look at the statistics.
all right.
smart move.  now while you fill out the questionnaire, i'll familiarize you with some of our options.
no options.
whatever you say...just answer one question.  what is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
i give up.
you.  you're the same.  no matter where you go, there you are. always the same old you.  let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  i know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. we call it an "ego trip".
i'm not interested in that.
you're gonna love this. --we offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
secret agent...how much is that?
aaah, let me tantalize you.  you're a top operative, back under deep cover on your most important mission.  people are trying to kill you left and right. you meet a beautiful, exotic woman...
go on.
i don't wanna spoil it for you, doug. just rest assured, by the time the trip is over, you get the girl, you kill the bad guys, and you save the entire planet.  now you tell me.  is that worth three hundred measly credits?
good evening...  doug.  i'm dr. lull.
nice to meet you.
two-headed monsters?
don't you keep up with the news?  we're doing alien artifacts now.
so, been married long?
eight years.
i see.  slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
not really.  i've just always been fascinated by mars.
your sexual orientation?
hetero.
hmmm.  and how do you like your women?
blonde, brunette, redhead?
brunette.
slim, athletic, voluptuous?
demure, aggressive, sleazy?  be honest.
sleazy...and demure.
forty-one a, ernie.
bob?
what is it?
you better get down here.
i'm with an very important client.
looks like another schizoid embolism.
what the fuck is going on here?!  you can't install a simple goddamn double implant?!
it's not my fault.  we hit a memory cap.
they'll be here any minute!  they'll kill you all!
what's he talking about?
let me go!
listen to me!  he's been going on and on about mars.  he's really been there.
use your head, you dumb bitch!  he's acting out the secret agent role from his ego trip!
i'm afraid that's not possible.
why not?
we haven't implanted it yet.
oh shit....oh shit...
i've been trying to tell you.  someone erased his memory.
okay, this is what we're gonna do. renata, cover up any memory he has of us or rekall.
i'll do what i can.  it's getting messy in there.
ernie, dump him in a cab.  around the corner.  tiffany, you help him.  i'll destroy his file and refund his money.  and if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of douglas quaid.
come on...put his head in place.
i'm sorry.  would you please rephrase the question.
how did i get in this taxi?!
the door opened.  you got it.
hey, quaid!
harry!
how was your trip to mars?
what trip?
you went to rekall, remember?
i did?
yeah, you did.  i told you not to but you did anyway.
what are you, my father?
let me buy you a drink.
no, harry, i'm already late...see you tomorrow.
harry, what the hell is this?
come on, let's go have that drink.
what the fuck did i do wrong?!  tell me!
you blabbed, quaid!  you blabbed about mars!
are you crazy?!  i don't know anything about mars.
you shoulda listened to me, quaid. i was there to keep you outta trouble.
harry, you're making a big mistake! you've got me mixed up with somebody else!
unh-uh, pal.  you've got yourself mixed up with somebody else.
what are you doing?
some men just tried to kill me!
muggers?!  doug, are you all right? what happened?
no!  spies or something.  and harry from work...get down!
harry from work...he was the boss.
take it easy.  tell me exactly what happened?  why would "spies" want to kill you?
i don't know!  it had something to do with mars.
mars?  you've never even been to mars.
i know it sounds crazy, but i went to this rekall place after work, and...
you went to those brain butchers?!
let me finish!
what did they do to you?  tell me!
--i got a trip to mars.
oh god, doug.
forget rekall, will you!  these men were going to kill me...
doug, nobody tried to kill you.
they did!  but i killed them!
you call this a paranoid delusion?!
doug...
not talk!  i said talk!!
i'm not your wife.
the hell you're not.
i swear to god!...i never saw you before six weeks ago!  our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
you think i'm an idiot?  remember our wedding?
it was implanted by the agency.
and falling in love?
implanted.
our friends, my job, eight years together, i suppose all this was implanted too?
the job's real. -- but the agency set it up.
bullshit.
o.k. then.  if i'm not me, then who the hell am i?
beats me.  i just work here.
but doug...there's something i want you to know.  you're the best assignment i ever hand.  really.
i'm honored.
you sure you don't wanna...?  for old time's sake.  if you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
i didn't know you were so kinky.
it's time you found out.
clever girl.
doug...you wouldn't shoot me, would you?  after all we've been through?
yeah.  some of it was fun.
where?
up to the right.
i want that fucker dead.
i don't blame you man.  i wouldn't want quaid porkin' my old lady.
are you saying she liked it?
i'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
what the fuck is going on down there?!
i'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
if i wanted him dead, you moron, i wouldn't have dumped him on earth.
we can't let him run around.  he knows too much.
lori says he can't remember jack shit!
that's now.  in an hour, he could have total recall.
listen to me, richter, i want quaid delivered alive for re-implantation. have you got that?  i want him back in place with lori.
what was that?  i couldn't hear you.
i've got quaid.
where is he?
level 2.  galleria.
he shoulda killed quaid back on mars.
what do you want?
they've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what i say.
don't bother looking.  it's in your skull.
who are you?
never mind.  wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  that'll muffle the signal.
how'd you find me?
i'd advise you to hurry.
shit!
what is it?
this is the suitcase you gave me.
i gave you?
i'm leaving it here.  come get it and keep moving.
wait!
what?
...who are you?
we were buddies in the agency back on mars.  you asked me to find you if you disappeared.  so here i am, good-bye.
what was i doing on mars?!  damn!
that son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
i've got him.  the guy in the turban.
welcome to johnnycab.  where can i...?
drive!  drive!!
would you please repeat the destination?
anywhere!  go!..just go -- oh shit!! shit!!
the fare is eighteen credits, please.
quit while you're ahead.
thanks for taking johnnycab.
i've got a weak signal over there.
split up.  find him.
he's not at ground level.
up!
i've got a lock!  there!
come on!
mr. cohaagen wants to see you right away.
any news of quaid?
not since you lost him.
watch your mouth, captain.
look at this shit.
what the hell is this?
quaid!  that's quaid!
where?
there!  the woman!
her!
arrest that woman!
richter, do you know why i'm such a happy person?
no, sir.
because i've got the greatest job in the solar system.  as long as the turbinium keeps flowing, i can do anything i want.  anything.  if fact, the only thing i ever worry about is that one day, if the rebels win, it all might end.
he had help.  from our side, sir.
i know that.
but i thought...
who told you to think?!  i don't give you enough information to think!  you do what you're told!!  that's what you do!
yes, sir.
now let's get down to business.  kuato wants what's in quaid's head.  and he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic.  now i have a little plan to keep this from happening.  --do you think you can play along?
yes, sir.
great!  because, otherwise i'll erase your ass.
nice to have you back with us, mr. brubaker.
thank you.
would you like the same suite?
definitely.
hmm.  it seems you left something in our safe.
get it, please.
identification?
i'll go encode your room key.
thank you.
there you go, mr. brubaker.  suite 610 in the east wing.
may i use your pen?
what's wrong with this one?
he ain't got five kids to feed.
where's yours?
over there man.
you got the job.
welcome to mars.
what was that?  an accident?
what to the rebels want?
oh, the usual.  more money, more freedom, more air.
so, where to?
the last resort.
you're getting off to an early start.
first time on mars?
yeah...well, actually no...sort of.
man don't know if he's been to mars or not
tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
freaks?...'fraid so, man.  goes with the territory.
what happened to them?
cheap domes.  and no air to screen out the rays.
well, there it is; the last resort.  sure you wanna go in?
why not?
i know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
and you get a kickback.
ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?
blondes.
i think it's still hungry.
hey, hey tony.  give the big guy a break.
relax, you'll live longer.
i thought cohaagen tortured you to death!
i guess he didn't.
you couldn't get me a message?  you never wondered what happened to me?
...what?
there's something i have to tell you...
i don't remember you.
what are you talking about?
i don't remember you.  i don't remember us.  i don't even remember me.
what, did you get amnesia?...how'd you get here?
hauser left me a note.
hauser?  you're hauser.
not any more.
hauser, you're lost your mind.
i didn't lose it.  cohaagen stole it. he found out that hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  me.
this is too weird.
then he dumped me on earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
wait, did you say wife?...are you fuckin' married!!?
she wasn't really my wife.
oh, she isn't really your wife.  how stupid of me...she was hauser's wife.
forget i said wife.
no. let's forget everything!  i've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
why would i lie to you?
because you're still working for cohaagen.
don't be ridiculous.
you never loved me, hauser!  you just used me to get inside.
inside what?
i think you better leave.
melina, hauser sent me to do something.
i'm not falling for it.
he said there's enough in here to nail cohaagen for good.
get out!
i said get out!
melina, please...people are trying to kill me.
lemme ask you a question.  ever fuck a mutant?
take me to the hotel.
what do you want?
this is going to be very difficult for you at accept, mr. quaid.
i'm listening.
i'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
ya know, doc, you could have folled me.
i'm quite serious.  you're not here, and neither am i.
amazing.  where are we?
at rekall.
you're strapped into an implant chair, and i'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
oh, i get it; i'm dreaming!  and this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
not exactly.  what you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  but you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
i've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  i'm sorry to tell you this, mr. quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. we can't snap you out of your fantasy. i've been sent in to try to talk you down.
how much is cohaagen paying you for this?
think about it.  your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. everything after that--the chases, the trip to mars, your suite here at the hilton--these are all elements of your rekall holiday.  and ego trip: you paid to be a secret agent.
bullshit.  it's all coincidence.
what about the girl?  brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  is that a coincidence?
she's real.  i dreamed about her before i even went to rekall.
mr. quaid, can you hear yourself? "she's real because you dreamed her?"
that's right.
you open it.
no need to be rude.  i'll do it.
i suppose you're not here either.
i'm here at rekall.
i love you.
right.  that's why you tried to kill me.
nooo!  i would never do anything to hurt you.  i want you to come back to me.
bullshit.
suppose i do...then what?
swallow this.
what is it?
it's a symbol.  of your desire to return to reality. --inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.
then i can pull this trigger, and it won't matter.
doug, don't!
i thought you didn't like me.
if cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
so you dropped by to apologize?
kuato wants to see you.  come on!
now what?
jump!
by the way...ever heard of a company names rekall?
i used to model for 'em, why?
just wondering.
need a ride?
the last resort!  quick!
shut up and drive!
whatcha doin' to me, man?!  i got six kids to feed!
not bad, for a hooker.
i'm not a hooker!  that's my cover.
richter!  call from cohaagen.
this is richter sir...i've got them pinned down.
stop fighting and get out.
they've got quaid!  they're protecting him!
perfect!...get out of sector g.  now. don't think.  do it.
yes, sir.
pull them out.
o.k., everybody pull out!
the first settlers are buried here. they worked themselves to death, but cohaagen ended up with all the money. he built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
i saw them.
and if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
but maybe you can change all that.
i think my grampa might be here.
what can i do?
kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were hauser.
like what?
all sorts of things.  you might even remember you loved me.
i don't need kuato for that.
oh, since when?
if we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning.
we don't have much choice then, do we?
sit down.
where's kuato?
on his way.
you heard the rumors about the pyramid mine?
yeah.
cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
what, aliens?
you tell me.
i don't know.
yes, you do.  that's why we brought you here.  --  cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  and kuato's  gonna dig it out.
you're kuato, right?
wrong.  kuato's a mutant.  so don't get upset when you see him.
i say we throw the switch and see what happens.
don't be an idiot.
shit!
c'mon!
they found us!  everybody out!
melina!
how could you do this?  you're a mutant.
hey, i got four kids to feed.
what happened to number five?
ah, shit.  you got me.  i ain't even married.  now put your fucking hands in the air!
well, my boy, you're a hero.
fuck you.
don't be modest.  kuato's dead; the resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing.
he's lying.
you two-faced-bastard.
you see, quaid, none of my people could get close to kuato.  the fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  so hauser and i sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
he's lying.  hauser turned against you.
that's what we wanted you to think. the fact is, hauser volunteered to become doug quaid. it was the only way to fool the psychics.
get your story straight.  this idiot's been trying to kill me since i went to rekall.  --you don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
he wasn't in on it.  you set him off by going to rekall.
so why am i still alive?
we gave you lots of help.  benny here...
the guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form hauser...all of that was set up by us.
sorry.  too perfect.
perfect, my ass!  --you pop your memory cap before we can activate you.  then richter goes hod wild, screwing up everything i spent a year planning. --frankly, i'm amazed is worked.
well, cohaagen, i have to hand it to you...this is the best mindfuck yet.
don't take my word for it, quaid. someone you trust wants to talk to you.
who is it this time--my mother?
the guy's a fucking asshole.
not true, he's one of my best friends...he's got a big house and a mercedes.  and you like melina, right?  well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--that's right.  she's gonna be hauser's babe.
come on, cohaagen!  you got what you want.  give these people air!
my friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  fire it up, doc.
are you all right?  are you still you?
i'm not sure dear?  what do you think?
kill him.
it's about goddamn time.
where are you going?!
the reactor.
what reactor?!
the one in the mine!
people are dying, quaid!!  stop!!  we've got to get air!!
where's this "reactor" come from?
aliens built it.
aliens?!
you sure about this?
it's just up ahead.
cohaagen knows it makes air.  but the bastard won't turn it on.
of course not.  if mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
the whole core of mars is ice.  the reactor melts it and releases oxygen.
enough for everybody to breathe?
what are you afraid of?  turn it on.
impossible.  once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  mars will go into global meltdown.--that's why the aliens never turned it on.
do you expect me to believe you?
who gives a shit what you believe? in thirty seconds, you'll be dead. then i'll blow this place up...
i didn't want it to end this way.  i wanted hauser back.  but nooo.  you had to be quaid.
i am quaid.
you're nothing!  you're nobody!  you're a stupid dream.  well all dreams come to an end.
what's wrong?
i just has a terrible thought...what is this is all a dream?
then kiss me quick...before you wake up.
i love you.
i love you.
is that better?
mmmm.....
poor baby.  this is getting to be an obsession.
who?
the brunette.  the one you told me about.
lori, i don't believe it...you're jealous of a dream!
who is she?
nobody.
nobody?!  what's her name?
i don't know.
tell me!
it's not funny, doug.  you dream about her every night.
but i'm always home by morning.
let me go!
aw, come on, baby...you're the girl of my dreams.
...you mean it?
you know i do.
lori...
yeah, sweetheart?
let's do it.
do what?
move to mars.
honey, do you have to spoil a perfectly wonderful morning.
just think about it.
sweetheart, we've been through this a million times.  you'd hate it on mars. it's dry; it's ugly; it's boring!  --i mean, really, a revolution could break out there any minute.
cohaagen says it's just a few extremists.
and you believe him?
all right, forget about it.
doug, maybe we should take a trip.
lori, move.
there's lots nicer places than mars.
well...what do you say?
i'm late.
sweetheart...i know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here.  okay?
lori, don't you understand?  i feel i was meant for something more than this.  i want to do something with my life.--i want to be somebody.
you are somebody.  you're the man i love.
bye.
hey harry...harry!  you ever heard of rekall?
rekall?
they sell fake memories.
oh, rekall.
yeah.
"rekallrekallrekall."  you thinkin' of goin' there?
i don't know.  maybe.
well don't.
why not?
a friend of mine tried one of their "special offers"...nearly got himself lobotomized.
no shit...
don't fuck with your brain, pal.  it ain't worth it.
doug...bob mcclane.
nice to meet you.
good to see ya. right this way.
now help me out here, doug.  you were interested in a memory of...
mars.
right.  mars.
that a problem?
to be perfectly honest with you, doug, if outer space is your thing, i think you'd be much happier  with one of our saturn cruises.everybody raves about 'em.

i'm telling you, doug, your brain won't know the difference.  guaranteed, or your money back.
what about the guy you lobotomized...did he get a refund?
you're talking ancient history, doug. nowadays, traveling with rekall is safer than getting on a rocket.  look at the statistics.
all right.
smart move.  now while you fill out the questionnaire, i'll familiarize you with some of our options.
no options.
whatever you say...just answer one question.  what is it that is exactly the same about every vacation you've ever taken?
i give up.
you.  you're the same.  no matter where you go, there you are. always the same old you.  let me suggest that you take a vacation from yourself.  i know it sounds wild, but it's the latest thing in travel. we call it an "ego trip".

good evening...  doug.  i'm dr. lull.

two-headed monsters?
don't you keep up with the news?  we're doing alien artifacts now.
so, been married long?
eight years.
i see.  slipping away for a little hanky-panky.
not really.  i've just always been fascinated by mars.
your sexual orientation?
hetero.
hmmm.  and how do you like your women?
blonde, brunette, redhead?
brunette.

demure, aggressive, sleazy?  be honest.
sleazy...and demure.
forty-one a, ernie.
bob?
what is it?
you better get down here.
i'm with an very important client.
looks like another schizoid embolism.
what the fuck is going on here?!  you can't install a simple goddamn double implant?!
it's not my fault.  we hit a memory cap.
they'll be here any minute!  they'll kill you all!
what's he talking about?
let me go!
listen to me!  he's been going on and on about mars.  he's really been there.
use your head, you dumb bitch!  he's acting out the secret agent role from his ego trip!
i'm afraid that's not possible.
why not?
we haven't implanted it yet.
oh shit....oh shit...
i've been trying to tell you.  someone erased his memory.
okay, this is what we're gonna do. renata, cover up any memory he has of us or rekall.
i'll do what i can.  it's getting messy in there.
ernie, dump him in a cab.  around the corner.  tiffany, you help him.  i'll destroy his file and refund his money.  and if anybody comes asking...we've never heard of douglas quaid.
come on...put his head in place.
i'm sorry.  would you please rephrase the question.
how did i get in this taxi?!
the door opened.  you got it.
hey, quaid!
harry!
how was your trip to mars?
what trip?
you went to rekall, remember?
i did?
yeah, you did.  i told you not to but you did anyway.
what are you, my father?
let me buy you a drink.
no, harry, i'm already late...see you tomorrow.
harry, what the hell is this?
come on, let's go have that drink.
what the fuck did i do wrong?!  tell me!
you blabbed, quaid!  you blabbed about mars!
are you crazy?!  i don't know anything about mars.
you shoulda listened to me, quaid. i was there to keep you outta trouble.
harry, you're making a big mistake! you've got me mixed up with somebody else!
unh-uh, pal.  you've got yourself mixed up with somebody else.
what are you doing?
some men just tried to kill me!
muggers?!  doug, are you all right? what happened?
no!  spies or something.  and harry from work...get down!
harry from work...he was the boss.
take it easy.  tell me exactly what happened?  why would "spies" want to kill you?
i don't know!  it had something to do with mars.
mars?  you've never even been to mars.
i know it sounds crazy, but i went to this rekall place after work, and...
you went to those brain butchers?!
let me finish!
what did they do to you?  tell me!
--i got a trip to mars.
oh god, doug.
forget rekall, will you!  these men were going to kill me...
doug, nobody tried to kill you.
they did!  but i killed them!
you call this a paranoid delusion?!
doug...
not talk!  i said talk!!
i'm not your wife.
the hell you're not.
i swear to god!...i never saw you before six weeks ago!  our marriage is just a memory implant -- agghh!
you think i'm an idiot?  remember our wedding?
it was implanted by the agency.
and falling in love?
implanted.
our friends, my job, eight years together, i suppose all this was implanted too?
the job's real. -- but the agency set it up.
bullshit.
o.k. then.  if i'm not me, then who the hell am i?
beats me.  i just work here.
but doug...there's something i want you to know.  you're the best assignment i ever hand.  really.
i'm honored.
you sure you don't wanna...?  for old time's sake.  if you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
i didn't know you were so kinky.
it's time you found out.
clever girl.
doug...you wouldn't shoot me, would you?  after all we've been through?
yeah.  some of it was fun.
where?
up to the right.
i want that fucker dead.
i don't blame you man.  i wouldn't want quaid porkin' my old lady.
are you saying she liked it?
i'm sure she hated every fuckin' minute of it.
what the fuck is going on down there?!
i'm trying to neutralize a traitor.
if i wanted him dead, you moron, i wouldn't have dumped him on earth.
we can't let him run around.  he knows too much.
lori says he can't remember jack shit!
that's now.  in an hour, he could have total recall.
listen to me, richter, i want quaid delivered alive for re-implantation. have you got that?  i want him back in place with lori.
what was that?  i couldn't hear you.
i've got quaid.
where is he?
level 2.  galleria.
he shoulda killed quaid back on mars.
what do you want?
they've got you bugged, and they'll be busting down the door in about three minutes unless you do exactly what i say.
don't bother looking.  it's in your skull.
who are you?
never mind.  wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  that'll muffle the signal.
how'd you find me?
i'd advise you to hurry.
shit!
what is it?
this is the suitcase you gave me.
i gave you?
i'm leaving it here.  come get it and keep moving.
wait!
what?
...who are you?
we were buddies in the agency back on mars.  you asked me to find you if you disappeared.  so here i am, good-bye.
what was i doing on mars?!  damn!
that son of a bitch got to be around here somewhere.
i've got him.  the guy in the turban.
welcome to johnnycab.  where can i...?
drive!  drive!!
would you please repeat the destination?
anywhere!  go!..just go -- oh shit!! shit!!
the fare is eighteen credits, please.
quit while you're ahead.
thanks for taking johnnycab.
i've got a weak signal over there.
split up.  find him.
he's not at ground level.
up!
i've got a lock!  there!
come on!
mr. cohaagen wants to see you right away.
any news of quaid?
not since you lost him.
watch your mouth, captain.
look at this shit.
what the hell is this?
quaid!  that's quaid!
where?
there!  the woman!
her!
arrest that woman!
richter, do you know why i'm such a happy person?
no, sir.
because i've got the greatest job in the solar system.  as long as the turbinium keeps flowing, i can do anything i want.  anything.  if fact, the only thing i ever worry about is that one day, if the rebels win, it all might end.
he had help.  from our side, sir.
i know that.
but i thought...
who told you to think?!  i don't give you enough information to think!  you do what you're told!!  that's what you do!
yes, sir.
now let's get down to business.  kuato wants what's in quaid's head.  and he might be able to get it, cause they say he's psychic.  now i have a little plan to keep this from happening.  --do you think you can play along?
yes, sir.
great!  because, otherwise i'll erase your ass.
nice to have you back with us, mr. brubaker.
thank you.
would you like the same suite?
definitely.
hmm.  it seems you left something in our safe.
get it, please.
identification?
i'll go encode your room key.
thank you.
there you go, mr. brubaker.  suite 610 in the east wing.
may i use your pen?
what's wrong with this one?
he ain't got five kids to feed.
where's yours?
over there man.
you got the job.
welcome to mars.
what was that?  an accident?
what to the rebels want?
oh, the usual.  more money, more freedom, more air.
so, where to?
the last resort.
you're getting off to an early start.
first time on mars?
yeah...well, actually no...sort of.
man don't know if he's been to mars or not
tell me something; are all psychics, uh....?
freaks?...'fraid so, man.  goes with the territory.
what happened to them?
cheap domes.  and no air to screen out the rays.
well, there it is; the last resort.  sure you wanna go in?
why not?
i know a much better place down the block -- the girls are clean; the liquor ain't watered down...
and you get a kickback.
ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?
blondes.
i think it's still hungry.
hey, hey tony.  give the big guy a break.
relax, you'll live longer.
i thought cohaagen tortured you to death!
i guess he didn't.
you couldn't get me a message?  you never wondered what happened to me?
...what?
there's something i have to tell you...
i don't remember you.
what are you talking about?
i don't remember you.  i don't remember us.  i don't even remember me.
what, did you get amnesia?...how'd you get here?
hauser left me a note.
hauser?  you're hauser.
not any more.
hauser, you're lost your mind.
i didn't lose it.  cohaagen stole it. he found out that hauser switched sides,-so he turned him into somebody else.  me.
this is too weird.
then he dumped me on earth with a wife and a lousy job and ...
wait, did you say wife?...are you fuckin' married!!?
she wasn't really my wife.
oh, she isn't really your wife.  how stupid of me...she was hauser's wife.
forget i said wife.
no. let's forget everything!  i've had it with you and your goddamn lies.
why would i lie to you?
because you're still working for cohaagen.
don't be ridiculous.
you never loved me, hauser!  you just used me to get inside.
inside what?
i think you better leave.
melina, hauser sent me to do something.
i'm not falling for it.
he said there's enough in here to nail cohaagen for good.
get out!
i said get out!
melina, please...people are trying to kill me.
lemme ask you a question.  ever fuck a mutant?
take me to the hotel.
what do you want?
this is going to be very difficult for you at accept, mr. quaid.
i'm listening.
i'm afraid you're not really standing here right now.
ya know, doc, you could have folled me.
i'm quite serious.  you're not here, and neither am i.
amazing.  where are we?
at rekall.
you're strapped into an implant chair, and i'm monitoring you at a psycho-probe console.
oh, i get it; i'm dreaming!  and this is all part of that delightful vacation your company sold me.
not exactly.  what you're experiencing is a free-form delusion based on our memory tapes.  but you're inventing it yourself as you go along.
well, if this is my delusion, who invited you?
i've been artificially implanted as an emergency measure.  i'm sorry to tell you this, mr. quaid, but you've suffered a schizoid embolism. we can't snap you out of your fantasy. i've been sent in to try to talk you down.
how much is cohaagen paying you for this?
think about it.  your dream started in the middle of the implant procedure. everything after that--the chases, the trip to mars, your suite here at the hilton--these are all elements of your rekall holiday.  and ego trip: you paid to be a secret agent.
bullshit.  it's all coincidence.
what about the girl?  brunette, athletic, sleazy and demure; just like you specified.  is that a coincidence?
she's real.  i dreamed about her before i even went to rekall.
mr. quaid, can you hear yourself? "she's real because you dreamed her?"
that's right.
you open it.
no need to be rude.  i'll do it.
i suppose you're not here either.
i'm here at rekall.
i love you.
right.  that's why you tried to kill me.
nooo!  i would never do anything to hurt you.  i want you to come back to me.
bullshit.
suppose i do...then what?
swallow this.
what is it?
it's a symbol.  of your desire to return to reality. --inside your dream, you'll fall asleep.
then i can pull this trigger, and it won't matter.
doug, don't!
i thought you didn't like me.
if cohaagen wants you dead, you might be okay.
so you dropped by to apologize?
kuato wants to see you.  come on!
now what?
jump!
by the way...ever heard of a company names rekall?
i used to model for 'em, why?
just wondering.
need a ride?
the last resort!  quick!
shut up and drive!
whatcha doin' to me, man?!  i got six kids to feed!
not bad, for a hooker.
i'm not a hooker!  that's my cover.
richter!  call from cohaagen.
this is richter sir...i've got them pinned down.
stop fighting and get out.
they've got quaid!  they're protecting him!
perfect!...get out of sector g.  now. don't think.  do it.
yes, sir.
pull them out.
o.k., everybody pull out!
the first settlers are buried here. they worked themselves to death, but cohaagen ended up with all the money. he built cheap domes and watched their kids turn into freaks.
i saw them.
and if you wanna breathe, you gotta but his air.
but maybe you can change all that.
i think my grampa might be here.
what can i do?
kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were hauser.
like what?
all sorts of things.  you might even remember you loved me.
i don't need kuato for that.
oh, since when?
if we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning.
we don't have much choice then, do we?
sit down.
where's kuato?
on his way.
you heard the rumors about the pyramid mine?
yeah.
cohaagen found something weird inside, and it's got him scared shitless.
what, aliens?
you tell me.
i don't know.
yes, you do.  that's why we brought you here.  --  cohaagen's big secret is buried in that black hole you call a brain.  and kuato's  gonna dig it out.
you're kuato, right?
wrong.  kuato's a mutant.  so don't get upset when you see him.
i say we throw the switch and see what happens.
don't be an idiot.
shit!
c'mon!
they found us!  everybody out!
melina!
how could you do this?  you're a mutant.
hey, i got four kids to feed.
what happened to number five?
ah, shit.  you got me.  i ain't even married.  now put your fucking hands in the air!
well, my boy, you're a hero.
fuck you.
don't be modest.  kuato's dead; the resistance has been completely wiped out; and you were the key to the whole thing.
he's lying.
you two-faced-bastard.
you see, quaid, none of my people could get close to kuato.  the fucking mutants could always sniff us out.  so hauser and i sat down and invented you: the perfect mole.
he's lying.  hauser turned against you.
that's what we wanted you to think. the fact is, hauser volunteered to become doug quaid. it was the only way to fool the psychics.
get your story straight.  this idiot's been trying to kill me since i went to rekall.  --you don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
he wasn't in on it.  you set him off by going to rekall.
so why am i still alive?
we gave you lots of help.  benny here...
the guy with the suitcase; the mask; the money; the message form hauser...all of that was set up by us.
sorry.  too perfect.
perfect, my ass!  --you pop your memory cap before we can activate you.  then richter goes hod wild, screwing up everything i spent a year planning. --frankly, i'm amazed is worked.
well, cohaagen, i have to hand it to you...this is the best mindfuck yet.
don't take my word for it, quaid. someone you trust wants to talk to you.
who is it this time--my mother?
the guy's a fucking asshole.
not true, he's one of my best friends...he's got a big house and a mercedes.  and you like melina, right?  well, you'll get to fuck her every night.--that's right.  she's gonna be hauser's babe.
come on, cohaagen!  you got what you want.  give these people air!
my friend, five minutes from now, you won't give a shit about the people.  fire it up, doc.
are you all right?  are you still you?
i'm not sure dear?  what do you think?
kill him.
it's about goddamn time.
where are you going?!
the reactor.
what reactor?!
the one in the mine!
people are dying, quaid!!  stop!!  we've got to get air!!
where's this "reactor" come from?
aliens built it.
aliens?!
you sure about this?
it's just up ahead.
cohaagen knows it makes air.  but the bastard won't turn it on.
of course not.  if mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
the whole core of mars is ice.  the reactor melts it and releases oxygen.
enough for everybody to breathe?
what are you afraid of?  turn it on.
impossible.  once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  mars will go into global meltdown.--that's why the aliens never turned it on.
do you expect me to believe you?
who gives a shit what you believe? in thirty seconds, you'll be dead. then i'll blow this place up...
i didn't want it to end this way.  i wanted hauser back.  but nooo.  you had to be quaid.
i am quaid.
you're nothing!  you're nobody!  you're a stupid dream.  well all dreams come to an end.
what's wrong?
i just has a terrible thought...what is this is all a dream?
then kiss me quick...before you wake up.
