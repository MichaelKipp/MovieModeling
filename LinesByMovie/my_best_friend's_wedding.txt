is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?
if your ass is not chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.
is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
I have adjusted, and thanks for asking.
see the pull of a book like twenty chefs, is not who i put in.  it is who i leave out.
which is everyone you could not get in.
plus some guys whose food i do not like.
needs salt.
is newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you are setting me up w...
... i do not send you men, anymore. you do not know what to do with them.
sometimes i do.  like for two months.
... weeks.
no, no, the opposite.  that is my best friend, michael o'neal. he sounds desperate to talk.
the wandering sportswriter.
nine years, we have seen each other through everything.  losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we have had the best times.  the best times of my life, maybe.  just drinking and talking.  even over a phone.
kindred spirits.
no, he is nothing like me.  he is like you.  only straight.
he is the salt of the earth.  kind and loyal and generous.  the one constant thing in my life, is he will always be there.
he is still in love with you.
whenever george tells someone how steadfast i am, he always makes me sound boring.
solid and genuine is not boring. michael can be completely insane...
I have lost interest.
he takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
blood oath.
he says, "swear.  when we are both 28, if we have never been married... we marry each other!"
you think...
desperate.  to talk.
he is not proposing marriage, there is no way I am buying one word of th...
then why are you compulsively eating? if you are not hysterical?
he can not do that to me!
we are about to find out.
we will never be the same.
i have a suggestion...
I will have to kill myself before i call him.
I have been calling for days!
yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  i tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...
well, that is great.  you have not really had anybody since dingbat jennylee...
you do not understand.  I have never felt this way about anybody!
and she is all wrong for me!
well, somet...
i mean she is a junior at chicago university, she is twenty years old! like when i first met you.
well, sure.
but they are so down to earth, such wonderful people...
you have met her parents.
michael, it is wednesday night, you can not possibly be getting married on su...
actually, it all starts tomorrow. it is one of those four-day weddings, with all the traditional events, and ten million people flying in from madagascar such.
well, the sox are at home.  si's letting me do a profile on the big hurt.  that is frank...
... thomas, yeh.
well, maybe we should talk ab...
i need you.
please come, please.
w...
i can not wait for you to meet her!
you have no appropriate sense of emergency.  my best friend is ruining his life.
no, he is ruining yours.
same difference.  if you love someone, it is your duty to save them from themselves.
you have a real philosophy of life.
it is called the law of love, asshole.
he is adored me for nine goddamn years.
i can see why.
she knows him maybe five seconds, plus she has billions of dollars, plus she is perfect, so do not go feeling sorry for miss pre-teen illinois!
all I have heard, from the day i met michael, is julianne this, and julianne that...
well, we're...
i think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you.
my heart's in my throat, here. right off, i have to ask this monstrous favor...
you need a few dollars.
excuse me?
i can be quick.  i can even be funny.
but i can not be dry.
can you watch the road?
see.  dry.  it is in the delivery.
this is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
you can not believe what it would cost to bring in a temp.
uh.  how about promoting a bridesmaid?  someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
the bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. identical twin debutantes from nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  with amazing bodies!
which was the disqualifying factor?
the twin part.  i like to remain impartial in my contempt.
i thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
not you.  you will not be comfortable unless you are distinctive.
what else did he tell you...
... you hate weddings, you never go.
that is why michael and i were the wrong fit.  right from the start.
he said that, too.
do not you have to be somewh...
... just my bridal shower.  and michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at comiskey for a one-thirty game.
what is the sec...
mirrors.
... luckiest guy in the northern fucking hemisphere, is all I am s...
what? because I am a little understand...
... most sentimental schmucks i pity want a honeymoon after their wedding.  just to top it off.
I am excited sports illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he is only there a ye...
so your honeymoon is exactly where?
it depends.  if san antonio sweeps sacramento, we could start there. or phoenix.  or depending on indiana- clevel...
... garden sports, all.  little swing of maybe fifty degrees fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there is fine food and cocktails at a choice of embassy suit...
well.  you have been introduced to the symphonic range of...
... his snoring, yeah.  he says it is worse than ever.  that snaffle one...?
how about...
... cigars in bed? i broke him on that.  but the bathroom's a swamp, he wears reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...
he sucks soup through his front teeth.
a trademark move, do not touch it.
but he sure can kiss.
it is been awhile.  I will take your word.
after two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, i made a command decision that changed my life.
and loving him means loving all of this.
do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
so it is sweet of you to be protective...
let me rephrase that...
but nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
... except one.
you will always be there.  in his mind.  the perfect creature he loved for all those y...
well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
I am not joking.  i had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I have got 'em.
no.
and the answer was so simple.
i was gonna predict that.
you win.
you are enshrined in his heart and memory.  unassailable. which works out great.
I have missed a step.
he has you on a pedestal.  and me in his arms.
jesus, we are trapped!
ju...
no, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!
have you sized up the groomsmen, jules?  as m. of h., you get first fuck.  do not pick the short, hairy, rich one.
... unless he has a hump.
if he gives you grief, I will have him skillfully beaten, where the wounds will not show.
i guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
under the circumstances.  charmed to know you, jules.
nice meeting you, too, walt.
best everything, joe.  but I am going to dance with you.
dance?  you do not dance!  you learn to dance??
i just admire your maturity, that is all.  i mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring.  day after day, year after year...
... see, that is what i thought at first.  how can you like someone that perfect? no potential for long-range livability.
luckily.  the closer i watched, the more the fault came into focus.  each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
such as.
she is too genuine.
hate that.
how can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
what is next?
no matter how many times i leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.
endearingly absent-minded.
my very point.  here's another one...
every day.  she makes the bed.
quite the little eccentric.
at first, i thought it was a gag, but she is always done it!
is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
she admires.  tommy lasorda.
waiter! check, please!
she finds him "personable."
can that kind of defect be passed on genetically?
gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
first girl i ever knew.  who lets me give her a bath.
it is not just clubs.  this guy always knows the best everything. the best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best horowitz record, was he always like the...
... always.  the best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
stop, we are embarrassing h...
... best valley in new zealand, best... women's shoes...
where was that, florence, huh?
firenze.
the vespa? me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
till the gas ran out.
well, the school will be here. architecture will still be around. right now...
i travel every week.  college ball, motor sports, training camps...
the most important thing. is being together.
because i could come...
to the twins' soiree?  so they can paw you and drool...?
should i whistle down a cab?
hey, cabs are expensive.  I am cheap, remember?
pretty amazing girl, you have got. make that kind of sacrifice.
what, leaving school...
... all of it.  she is leaving her family, her friends, everything she knows.  she is putting her career on hold, and she seems a pretty ambitious, driven, kind of pers...
i mean walter owns the sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...
she would never.  never.  even think of that.
i guess you are right.  that would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...
i got the point.
still.  all's fair in love and w...
that would be a girl.  i do not even know.
about michael's job.
oh, that.  i forgot i even said th...
i just think you are wrong, is all.
probably am.  forget i brought it up.
i mean, he loves his job.
bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...
but he always says...
... whatever is manly and independent.
for the twins? what in the world is th...
gold nose hair clippers.
gold dog collars? they do not have dogs.
hello.
so... one almost has to...
exactly.
exactly what?
what you said.  make it appear that he is doing you the favor.
he will see right through it.
only.  if he wants to.
in six months, he will be happy, settled, successful...
he will not get mad, huh?
your call.  you can live a lie. in a fabulous selection of red roof inns.  or you can make one desperate stab at hap...
i just do not want to freak him out.
they both have some growing up to do.  but they are good people, they are starting with love. they have got time.
i think you are making a mistake, sir.
you are not eating.
i never eat when I am serene.
you never eat when you are despondent.
i switched that around when you were not looking.
last zoo we were in was... beijing, yeah?  sure.  the rhinos were fucking.
boy, those were the days.
it is weird being the groom.  all these things kimmy has to take care of...
you need a baby-sitter.  that is what I am here for.
is anybody watching?
i hope so.  this is all too mysterious to waste on just me.
julianne, reading my son-in-law's mail, is not something...
sir, this is important! have not you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
it is a fax from sports illustrated from ben isaacson, michael's boss.
i know ben.
i think he is been fired.
it does not say th...
he is said some things over the past few weeks.  look, this is why i came up with the idea of you offering him a job.
and you think he is kept this to himself.
he is too proud to beg for help. and if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. completely humiliating.
maybe.  i should call ben.
then it could all come out, sooner or later.  nobody should be in on this.  just you and me.  or, more correctly, i.
it is not just a gag, huh?
no, it's, uh... a real big favor.
wow and wow.  you have a date, after this?
never can tell.
he never mentioned that.  neither did y...
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
he needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
like family, huh?
it would only be, maybe, six months? or three or four? it would mean so much to him...
to him.
and to m...
... and you knew about this.
why do not you start being honest for one fucking sec...
michael!!
all of a sudden, I am supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans i had for my life...
well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!
I am sure glad I am hearing all this now, before it is too late!
what is that sup...
and what am i supposed to do with my life, huh? i am 28 years old! i work in a low-paying, low-status, zero-respect job which, unfortunately, i happen to fucking love.  how inconvenient.
no problem.  a little bullshit about daddy's "needs," and presto, I am a lap dog in high society.
michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
does it, really? how come you never took some sell-out establishment job? you had plenty of chances!
what a sweet little picture.  mommy and daddy are not losing a daughter, they are gaining a eunuch!
well, if that is the way you f...
damn straight, it is how i feel! what is their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "mikey-poo"? or do i have to change my name to "binky"?
fine.  I am an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you are well rid of m...
michael!!
uh, kimmy...?
we settled this.  and i reneged. that was not fair.
chill.  we do not want your face coming off with it.
chill?  since when do you say ch...
when I am talking to children.
you flew all the way h...
i noticed.  I am on the noon back. we have this thing with george's family in the hamptons.
you are butting in.
what i mean, when i say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. it is vulnerable and endearing. and that is annoying as shit.
you like her.
if i did not have to hate her, I would adore her.
i was devastated.
go figure you.
because i realized.  when i see him say "i do," that knife will be in my heart.  and it will be there every...
there are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
you have been working on this, huh?
... and having "done the right thing" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times.
this is my whole life's happiness. i have to be ruthless.
and you believe that.
sure.
he was in love with me every day for nine years.  i can make him happier than she can.
it is not his happiness you are feeling guilty about...
i do not know the meaning of the word guilt!
impressive.
i am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! she would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
the man you love.
beyond reason.  the feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she will be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
someday she will thank you.
let's not get carried away.
jesus.  you are supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
i know that!  i was distracted by grief!
zit cream?
i wish.
neosporin?
try less appropriate.
ben gay.
that was thursday.
elmer's glue?
do not be ridiculous, we are having a serious conversation!
i give.
i can not even say it.
how do you know you can touch that plug? are you a licensed contractor?
what do you suggest?
i suppose it is too late to start over.
it is too late to start over.
you guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
like i said, dazzling.
yeah, it is in the contract.
well, then, I will take it up with her.
... trouser width, this is all classic.  which means safe, something I would wear.
i should look different.
you should look like you dressed yourself.
and I am supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you are what, a new yorker?
something like that.
long trip.  pretty nice of you to come.
well, I am close to her.  i wanted to meet the one that got away.
what?
I am just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
stay, huh?
i honestly wish i could...
I will call george's parents. tell them i need a best man who actually looks after me.
two words.
major.  dish.
manicure...
you do not miss much.
part of being a new yorker.
you are going to say it, are not you?
tell him you love him.  with all your heart.
I am taking my next book to viking.
tell him you have loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
I am moving this book to viking.
tell him you are afraid of love. afraid of needing.
needing.
to belong to someone.
tell him you know this is the worst, dumbest, cruelest moment to do this to him.  but there it is, and he has to choose.
and what will he do?
big weddings are so strange.
you keep saying that.
kim has all this stuff to do, i hardly see her.
well, you have got the rest of your lives.
you miss her, huh?
no.  I have got you.
do not you throw up on boat?
if you like.
I have been thinking a lot the last couple days.  about us, actually.
have you.
well.  there is a lot of memories to choose from...
it is more than that.
you have sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
you have been the man in mine.
and i was thinking this could be our last time.  alone.  together. you know?
except for the hot affairs we will have twice a year.
except for that.
i can hardly wait for your wedding.
me either.
i would not know.  i never had that many first thoughts.
i mean, you commit to a wedding. and then it seems like... this... momentum, you know?  you forget you... chose it.
dance card filled?
I will check.  i have it on powerbook, these days.
where did we first hear th...
the night we met.
so we heard it... like, right that... that first...
we danced to it.  just like this.
i thought michael was picking me up.
i told him, get the important stuff, kim's ring.  I will collect the inconsequentials.
i have not caused... a problem, have i?
nobody has.  so far.
well, you are a little early...
i need to make some calls. could i use... your office?
reverend dyer, this is kimberly's somewhat butch maid of honor...
... mr. julianne potter, prominent new york drag queen.
takes me back.
well.
no accents today.
yeah, kim told me they were giving you their dueling scarlet's act.  actually, they are sophomores at juilliard.
will she like it?
yes.
kimberly wanted to tickle the grandmas, so we figured, give 'em a cheap thrill.  walter supplied the decorative touches...
nose tackle from the bears... power forward from the bulls... defenseman from the black hawks... my personal favorite, the designated hitter...
... I am partial to the tight end.
this is usda prime, largely available, beef.  with no notice- able competition, present company excepted...
and yet here you are.  all celibate and reclusive.
with those big, dark, haunted eyes. as if you were harborin' some... unspeakably... guilty... secret.
well.  see.  that was a... reflex to see if it would...
... look good on kimberly.
right.  and then it did not want to come off.  exactly.
maybe it is happy there.
oh the way out of the crab house? we asked michael if we could see the ring?
he said you told him.  it would be safer with you.
an so it is.
i saw the show.
... well, maybe it works on fingers, too.
personally, i think mr.  michael's marrying the wrong girl.
you are much more his type.
it is no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that is s...
is not there a guard?  a janitor? a fucking cleaning woman? I will take a burglar!  somebody is got to be in th...
I am up against a deadline.
me, too.  I am getting married tomorrow.
that is my point!!
i forgot how cute you look.  when you get impossible.
it is just... up there... right in front of walter's... y'know, computer. if memory serves.
we could use... his computer, to... just e-mail those suckers right ou...
tomorrow is sunday.  nobody's doing business.  crack of dawn, monday, walter'll take you up there...
listen up, huh? even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?
you are right.  easy come, easy go.
this thing means that much to y...
it means a lot.
the fax is from ben, too.  man, it is my wedding, and my boss can not leave me alone...
... maybe it is congratulations.
michael? what ha...
mike.  i can not believe I am doing this to you on the night before your wedding.  but i think you need and deserve to know...
isabelle?  i need to talk to kim...
"mike, the funny thing is, he is offering you a gig you would be stupid to turn down..."
I am just tired.  please put her on?  thanks.
"maybe you should take the job. and dump the girl."
what happened?
it is over.
she denied it.  said i was crazy and paranoid.
a bad combination.
michael...
no, it is for the best, it really is.  we were so wrong for each other.
maybe tomorrow, you will feel dif...
the job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway.  she could not have lived with it.  i know that now.
should we take a walk?  or maybe some food sent up, or something...
i just want to be alone.  is that okay?
or we will go somewhere.  if you have the time.
if san antonio sweeps sacramento...
digger and george are with family in the hamptons until monday morning.  brevity is even more in order than usual.
hey, handsome.  brevity this...
i had the craziest dream last night?  walter and kimmy had asked your boss to...
look, i came down here to face everybody.  i did not want to slink away like some coward...
but the scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
she has not told anybody, what am i supposed to do?
get married, apparently.
this is her family and her fault.
and your point?
well.  how come she didn't...
because she is as chickenshit as you are, you morons are made for each other.
look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
they will eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
who?  the jerk who is running your life?
this must be... very, very, hard on him.
what with the psychosis and all, yeah.
when are you gonna come clean with your folks?
do not you see...
if you are waiting for "do you take this man?", that is considered poor form.
... that this is all my fault?
yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...
i love him.
i asked you...
she admits it is her fault.
does that make it right...
love does not have to be right. it just has to be love.
thank god you were here.
oh, yeah.
i was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
well, it happens.
... your one chance for true happiness?
... yeah, that.
you never want to do that, see, that is always a... costly turnover.  as they say in the sport biz.
the big hurt, huh?
nellie fox.  walter likes the past.  and he likes the little guys.
what is up?
shhh.
jules, what is wrong...
this is the dumbest thing i will ever do.  so dumb, in fact, that i can't.  i do not think.
uh.  i saw that moving...
do not speak!
you are not saying you actually... you are saying that y...
... wrote it, yeah.  I am the bad guy.
are you crazy?
i mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that is why you are confessing, i mean... i mean... how could you do that?
i did not know it would get sent.  i just wanted you to... get mad at kimmy... and...
actually.  lower.  i am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  lower. the layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
lower.
lower.
the pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
I am so glad you did not jump on that train, before...
i came here, looking for her.
why would she come here...
this is where i proposed.
i never forgot that.
it is two weeks.
almost three.
that is so romantic.
you can not believe you have lost her!  sooner or later, you will find her, and you will look in each other's eyes, and you will see all that love...
course, if it is later rather than sooner, I would hate to be you at six o'clock.  you have got a lot of explaining to...
I am just thinking of how she is hurting.  lost.  alone.  like her life is over.
that is little egotistical.
okay, we will split up.  you go to every romantic place you guys have, I will go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
if you find her...
the kiss.  may be hard.  for you to explain.  because the only fear she really has, is...
... me, yeah.  and she likes tommy lasorda.  case closed.
wallace egregious residence, mandy speaking.
it is jules, you guys have not had a call from, say, kimberly, have you?
oh, she is slipped out, the little monkey.  prob'ly with michael, doin' the nasty.
ex-cuse me?
i had this crank call?  from some guy who thinks he saw her? i said, what would a bride be doin', on her wedding...
you are <u<so right.  what a nerve on that guy!  bring my dress to church, huh?
in one minute.  you are going to feel so foolish.
why do not you just drive a stake through my heart?
have you ever heard of. irony?
i never want to go through this again.
that is entirely understandable.
i did what i came to do.
good girl.
I will think about it.  I am okay.
oh, you are more than okay.
