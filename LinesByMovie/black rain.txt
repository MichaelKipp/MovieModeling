i think she got to you, pappy.
you want a popsicle, go to good humor.  and don't call me 'pappy.'
still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
... it's not like you were slow or anything... i think you did just fine.  i think you did great.
thanks.
hey, hey, where you goin'?
home.
wait up.  you know the guy who did the weismuller through the window --
-- cavello.  ronnie cavello.
he works for frank abolofia. atlantic city.  casinos.
so why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
what's this?
let go...
back-up.
get rid of it.
why?
it's not regulation.  and the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
i'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater.
nick, let's go hunting.  bag cavello.
charlie...
short shift?
yeah... i came to save you.  if you're hopeless, i'll pull the plug.
it's getting too cold even for me, nick.
connie...
all right, how's the new partner?
high spirits, desire, commitment.
you'll take care of that.
give me a break, would you?
if you give me one.
are you expecting anyone?
i wasn't expecting you.
... i found the goombah... cavello. he's --
-- i should tear your head off.
whoa, i knew you were going to say that.  i absolutely anticipated that, nick.  but i said to myself, charlie, charlie, we can move up on this, so go find nicklaus... he'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
-- hey, i got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
what are they doing now?
eating scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
who do you think the jap is?
maybe cavello's buying a subaru. how would i know?
i don't blame you for being sore. it'll pass when we bag him.
charlie, don't do anything.  promise me?
what?
frank abolofia.
the wolf?
some party.
maybe we should do something?
charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.
what are you doing?
saving your life.
how big a package we talking about?
this by this...
dope?
not in that company.
the old man was a japanese paper manufacturer.  hotel room and rental car were full of it.
one guy do all the damage?
yeah.
thought you knew your way around dark alleys, detective.
doesn't speak a word of english. and he won't speak japanese either. no papers.  the japanese embassy is very interested.
why?
he's wanted in japan.  they want him first.  then we can have him.
what?
you and charlie are taking the jap home, tonight.
what...?  what if i say no?
check your gun before you leave. they're not allowed in japan.  it's a nice, safe country.
why me?
they said send a detective if i could spare one.  i can always spare you.
... nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
i was thinking the poconos, charlie. maybe vegas.
what are you missing?  riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. that shit is sadder than ethiopia.
beats forty hours on a plane.
they say we got to turn around and come right back.  that's what they say.  i got a plan.
i call, right?  i say i got the dreaded thirty six-hour asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days.  you and i become a driving force on the local geisha scene.
not a prayer.
hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from new york.  you're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since godzilla.
what'd you say?
where is the subway station, please.
nick... you up?
no.
nick, have i been a good partner?
number five with a bullet.
i just want you to know... i mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
go to sleep, charlie.
you didn't take, did you...?  you hear things.
i worked the three nine in queens, charlie.
i didn't know.
the lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad.  i was new, didn't know shit.  when the feathers flew, i got called in front of the special prosecutor.  it's on the top of my personnel file.  they think i'm dirty or i cut a deal. doesn't leave you with a lot of friends either way.
givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
hey, when in rome --
in rome, i'll bow.
you lost a man we wanted for some time.  it was very incompetent on your part, officer.
incompetent is letting people waltz through a secure area wearing your uniforms, carrying official documents.
i want a gun.
it is not allowed.
we're police officers.
you're foreigners.
work with me.  i want your best detective.
hey, inspector, i don't intend to take the rap for this.
do you know what this is?
let's go.
nick, we can't just --
i said let's go, charlie.
... detective ich-iro matsu-moto. hey, we're getting mr. moto on our side.
let's grab some food.
first decent idea you've had.
this should be it...
you said that in the last two places.
this the right place?
i hope not.
getting very weird.
i'd feel better if we had some heat.
maybe we should bail?
where do we start looking for this guy?
where would you look for the mafia?
where're you going, ichiro?
the mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at lombardi's.  and call me ich.
"goodness, gracious, great balls of fire."  to the killer.  jerry lee lewis.
jerry lee lewis, elvis, dinky doo and the don't's.  let's book, charlie.  if he starts on motown, we'll be here all night.
no, this is the place for the young yakuza.
that's what you said in the last three piss pots.
it's incredible.  hit him or something.
i don't think he'd feel it.
squid?
pussy, ass, soft personnel.
don't give him any more.
he gets as much as he wants.
joyce can be nice.
what'd she say?
that i should let you pay for the drinks.  kampai.
... we got to keep looking.  track him down!  great balls of fire!
what's the problem here?
... he's a sorry old guy, but i like him.
he couldn't find his ass with both hands.
now that's the kind of motorcycle i want to see you on.
sure, a rice burning crotch rocket...
nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help?  maybe i should work on that girl joyce, she speaks the language.
nick!
give us a break...
it's ichiro.  ich.
leave the rice cake outside and go home!
could you fill me in?
why don't you ask your chief detective?
because i want you to tell me.
the young are eating the old, something that usually doesn't happen here.
can we skip the poetry, inspector?
you know, inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
i don't deserve ohashi's respect.
why the hell not?
i don't, that's all.
you cool, ich?
cool?
you all right?  you okay?
what does ichiro mean, anyway?
what does charlie mean?
hey, all right.
it's not your job.
he was my partner.
they're blaming it on you.  christ, conklin, you didn't even tell me you lost the prisoner!
i planned on catching him, captain.
how?  you don't know the place.  you don't know the language.  get on the plane.
he killed a police officer.
your plane's at nine a.m.  be on it. that's orders.  period.
what happened?
they made you leave your hotel...  ... you caused a disturbance.
it may be too soon to talk about it. when someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  a tie, a pen.
why weren't you at the platform?
i couldn't keep up.  my shame is complete.
you must leave?
yeah...
i'll get him for you, nick.
ich said you left.
there was a change in plans.
dead gaiijin's are big news.
gaiijin?
an outside person.  a foreigner.  a barbarian.  you, me.  more you.
i could use some help.  show me around.  i'll pay you for your time.
i don't give tours.
you can count on the truth from people who don't like you.
you have a helluva way of asking for help.
you have a helluva way of answering.
look, you need ich.  i've been here five years and i still can't read all the street signs.
maybe i'm a quicker learner.
i don't think so.
i've continued working on the case!
i can see that.
how'd you get this?
i stole them.
know her?
we can ask someone i used to work with.  a criminal.  someone i pay money to...
a snitch?
what's he saying?
he says they're very nice.  he wants to know if you have anymore.
nick, no one's seen kobo in three days.  he might not even be in tokyo.
only one way to find out... get her up in the morning and put her to bed at night.
you said you could keep up with her! 'no problem, nick-san.'
no.  don't say anything.  don't do anything, and for christ's sake, don't apologize!
nick...
what'd i tell you?
there she is!
did i say that?
you toler -- yes, tolerate me.
are we getting married?
you're doing fine, ich.  now drop it, okay?
sure.
nick...
if you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
work, lunch, groceries, laundry... fabulous...
four goddamn days.  this is going nowhere...
she ever pull down her shades?
sure, but then i just pull out the photos.
chikuwa, hampen, kobu, konnayaku, ganmodoki --
ichiro --
broiled fish paste cake, kelp roll, soybean curd, devils tongue --
smells like bayonne at low tide.
don't be an ass.
he's on duty.
i paid for that.
yakuza.
good.  very good...
she disappeared... shit!
you were too far behind.
you can't come in.  they don't want --
gaiijin.
i'll check it out.
if i smell one drop of scotch on your breath, my friend --
you can trust me.
i'm not drunk...
we're through.  i mean it.  this is the end of the line, matsumoto.
nick --
shut-up.
... a godfather.  his man was killed at the printing plant.
i want to yank kobo.
not without a small army, nicklaus- san.
ich, my name is nick.  not nicklaus, not nicklaus-san, not nick-san. nick.
san is an honorable title.
keep the change.
i'm taking you back.
nick!
a few minutes faster, we might've nailed him.
what's this?
your visa has expired.  be on a plane in twenty-four hours or you will be deported.
while you were hanging out at the visa office, we found the son-of-a- bitch.
look.
hey...!  hey, i'm talking to you, inspector!
twenty-four hours, detective.
where does this sugai live?
a resort city, beppu.
i want to go talk to him.
what...?  why?
because he knows how to get to our man.
he'll never speak to a gaiijin.
i'll be a nice gaiijin.
it's very small.
big enough.
it's illegal, nick.
it's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, nick.  no.  i won't put myself in danger for you anymore.
you know where i can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? i'm buying.
somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
i need your help, joyce.
where's ich?
unavailable.
i've heard of sugai.  i've also heard of the emperor.  they're both national treasures.  one's a hood.
i need someone to translate for me.
my japanese isn't that hot... besides, you'll never get in.
it's my last shot.  i have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
and i'm supposed to care?
you could fake it.
you're wrong to sell ich short.
he drinks.
he's got a reason.
where's the wife?
you met her.
i'd invite you up but i know you'd hate the incense.  i chant.
what do you chant?
'nam oyo ranged kyo.'  you think it's dumb of course.
not if it works.  i'll meet you at the train?
i don't remember saying yes.
i don't remember you saying no.
they want your autograph.
who am i supposed to be?
this little guy thinks you're robert redford... the other one thinks you're charles bronson...
tell them i'm not.
what's in the box?
for sugai.  caviar, french cheese, ham... if you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, sugai may feel obligated to see you.
so i bring some cheese?
we're in?
the cheese...
seven years work by the finest engraver.  mass produced, sequentially numbered.  the best there has ever been, mr. conklin.
i'm impressed.  but let's use the short form.  i'm looking for --
-- kobo... i know.  he killed two of my partners.  one in new york, one at the printing plant.
i took kobo from the street.  i gave him a home, a future... but my ways were too slow for him... i served seven years in prison for my boss when i was a young man.  kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his oyabun.  he was supposed to take over this syndicate when i retired.
i want him.
he'll be dealt with.
our associates in new york were close to closing a deal with us.
the families who control the casinos?
yes.  unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... we can't afford not to deal with them.
imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
the feds would be onto you in a month.
not with these bills.  and even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?
why tell me this?
the other plate is currently in new york, in the hands of kobo's man. find it for me.
you trust me?
i'll pay you.
with these?
swiss bank deposit.  gold bullion. whatever you want.  you know the city and the police.
if i say no?
you're smarter than kobo.  you know the price of deceit.  think about it.
i don't have to.
no...
let's go.  him first.
nick, you can't do this.
it's done.  you don't have to come.
grab the keys, ich, and get inside.
no.
not now, man, okay, not now.  work with me.
start it.
i can't...
good.
he'll find out you took me.  i'm unprotected.  he'll kill us.  all of us.  you don't stand a chance.
you'll get ich killed.
no one's keeping him here.
bullshit, nick.  and don't tell me this is all just about charlie. it's not.
why would you care?
i still think you're a bastard.
what if i chant?
wouldn't help.  watch out for ich.
that wasn't our deal.
you want him dead too.
after a court convicts him.  he belongs to me.
just one, compadre... kampai.
kampai.
you did great, ichiro.
i called ohashi, he'll be waiting.  i like him waiting.
ugly... a couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  looking in.  always afraid. ugly little lives...
save it, i already took the tour.
you are a lucky man.  where you come from a man can stand out.  it's expected.  here a man is made to look a fool for standing out.
i like your friend, joyce.  you're lucky.
guess i'm on a roll.
she's such a long way home for you.
time, i've got plenty of.
this is my stop.
i'm amused.
don't be.
sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
then take it from him.
your plane leaves at six.  two officers will escort you.
for god's sake, ohashi, i need your help.  let me out of here!
you had my help, detective.
if anything happens to her while i'm here --
-- do you know where she is, detective?  do you know how to find her?  even where to start?  we will find them.
i have to get to sugai.
goodbye, officer.
i was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
i followed them.  an hour from the train station.
how many men?
i couldn't tell.
joyce?
i don't know.
we need the plate to negotiate with.
someone attacked him.
now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
thank you.  you have one?
a wife.  she left.
i'm sorry.
me too.
what's that for?
luck.
you know, nick, we can't lose.
why's that?
because we're the biggest things to hit this town since godzilla.
you all right?
yes...
call for help.
can't make you change your mind?
last time you asked me to come along i nearly got a hole in my head.
might be different in new york.
maybe.  if i come visit, we can find out.
i'd like that.
louder, pal, louder.
joyce, give the assistant chief inspector a drink, would you?
... remember, counterfeiting is the feds.  they'll be all over abolofia's place.  stick tight. you i.d. the other plate, he does real time.
right.
think we'll get him, nick?
we can't lose.
how can you be so sure?
i think she got to you, pappy.
you want a popsicle, go to good humor.  and don't call me 'pappy.'
still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.
... it's not like you were slow or anything... i think you did just fine.  i think you did great.
thanks.
hey, hey, where you goin'?
home.
wait up.  you know the guy who did the weismuller through the window --
-- cavello.  ronnie cavello.
he works for frank abolofia. atlantic city.  casinos.
so why dive through the glass for a nickel and dime bust?
what's this?
let go...
back-up.
get rid of it.
why?
it's not regulation.  and the only way you're gonna stop anybody with it is to show it to him, and while he's laughing, you can shove it down his throat.
i'll get rid of it when you get rid of the egg-beater.
nick, let's go hunting.  bag cavello.
charlie...
short shift?
yeah... i came to save you.  if you're hopeless, i'll pull the plug.
it's getting too cold even for me, nick.
connie...
all right, how's the new partner?
high spirits, desire, commitment.
you'll take care of that.
give me a break, would you?
if you give me one.
are you expecting anyone?
i wasn't expecting you.
... i found the goombah... cavello. he's --
-- i should tear your head off.
whoa, i knew you were going to say that.  i absolutely anticipated that, nick.  but i said to myself, charlie, charlie, we can move up on this, so go find nicklaus... he'll be pissed for a moment, but then it'll dawn on him --
-- hey, i got a better chance of being hit by a bus then moving up.
what are they doing now?
eating scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
who do you think the jap is?
maybe cavello's buying a subaru. how would i know?
i don't blame you for being sore. it'll pass when we bag him.
charlie, don't do anything.  promise me?
what?
frank abolofia.
the wolf?
some party.
maybe we should do something?
charlie, take your gum, stick it under your ass and keep it warm.

hey...!  hey, i'm talking to you, inspector!
twenty-four hours, detective.
where does this sugai live?
a resort city, beppu.
i want to go talk to him.
what...?  why?
because he knows how to get to our man.
he'll never speak to a gaiijin.
i'll be a nice gaiijin.
it's very small.
big enough.
it's illegal, nick.
it's a new deal.  ... coming with me tomorrow?
sugai's not going to be impressed with your gun, nick.  no.  i won't put myself in danger for you anymore.
you know where i can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? i'm buying.
somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
i need your help, joyce.
where's ich?
unavailable.
i've heard of sugai.  i've also heard of the emperor.  they're both national treasures.  one's a hood.
i need someone to translate for me.
my japanese isn't that hot... besides, you'll never get in.
it's my last shot.  i have to be on a plane home tomorrow night.
and i'm supposed to care?
you could fake it.
you're wrong to sell ich short.
he drinks.
he's got a reason.
where's the wife?
you met her.
i'd invite you up but i know you'd hate the incense.  i chant.
what do you chant?
'nam oyo ranged kyo.'  you think it's dumb of course.
not if it works.  i'll meet you at the train?
i don't remember saying yes.
i don't remember you saying no.
they want your autograph.
who am i supposed to be?
this little guy thinks you're robert redford... the other one thinks you're charles bronson...
tell them i'm not.
what's in the box?
for sugai.  caviar, french cheese, ham... if you come to apologize for interrupting his meeting, sugai may feel obligated to see you.
so i bring some cheese?
we're in?
the cheese...
seven years work by the finest engraver.  mass produced, sequentially numbered.  the best there has ever been, mr. conklin.
i'm impressed.  but let's use the short form.  i'm looking for --
-- kobo... i know.  he killed two of my partners.  one in new york, one at the printing plant.
i took kobo from the street.  i gave him a home, a future... but my ways were too slow for him... i served seven years in prison for my boss when i was a young man.  kobo wouldn't serve seven minutes for his oyabun.  he was supposed to take over this syndicate when i retired.
i want him.
he'll be dealt with.
our associates in new york were close to closing a deal with us.
the families who control the casinos?
yes.  unlike our syndicates, your criminals don't understand the words 'honor' and 'duty'... we can't afford not to deal with them.
imagine if your families could pay their gambling and drug debts with perfect counterfeit bought for cents on the dollar.
the feds would be onto you in a month.
not with these bills.  and even if it only took them six months, do you know what our profit margin would be?
why tell me this?
the other plate is currently in new york, in the hands of kobo's man. find it for me.
you trust me?
i'll pay you.
with these?
swiss bank deposit.  gold bullion. whatever you want.  you know the city and the police.
if i say no?
you're smarter than kobo.  you know the price of deceit.  think about it.
i don't have to.
no...
let's go.  him first.
nick, you can't do this.
it's done.  you don't have to come.
grab the keys, ich, and get inside.
no.
not now, man, okay, not now.  work with me.
start it.
i can't...
good.
he'll find out you took me.  i'm unprotected.  he'll kill us.  all of us.  you don't stand a chance.
you'll get ich killed.
no one's keeping him here.
bullshit, nick.  and don't tell me this is all just about charlie. it's not.
why would you care?
i still think you're a bastard.
what if i chant?
wouldn't help.  watch out for ich.
that wasn't our deal.
you want him dead too.
after a court convicts him.  he belongs to me.
just one, compadre... kampai.
kampai.
you did great, ichiro.
i called ohashi, he'll be waiting.  i like him waiting.
ugly... a couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules.  looking in.  always afraid. ugly little lives...
save it, i already took the tour.
you are a lucky man.  where you come from a man can stand out.  it's expected.  here a man is made to look a fool for standing out.
i like your friend, joyce.  you're lucky.
guess i'm on a roll.
she's such a long way home for you.
time, i've got plenty of.
this is my stop.
i'm amused.
don't be.
sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
then take it from him.
your plane leaves at six.  two officers will escort you.
for god's sake, ohashi, i need your help.  let me out of here!
you had my help, detective.
if anything happens to her while i'm here --
-- do you know where she is, detective?  do you know how to find her?  even where to start?  we will find them.
i have to get to sugai.
goodbye, officer.
i was ready to have your ass for taking off on me.
i followed them.  an hour from the train station.
how many men?
i couldn't tell.
joyce?
i don't know.
we need the plate to negotiate with.
someone attacked him.
now we've got nothing to negotiate with.
thank you.  you have one?
a wife.  she left.
i'm sorry.
me too.
what's that for?
luck.
you know, nick, we can't lose.
why's that?
because we're the biggest things to hit this town since godzilla.
you all right?
yes...
call for help.
can't make you change your mind?
last time you asked me to come along i nearly got a hole in my head.
might be different in new york.
maybe.  if i come visit, we can find out.
i'd like that.
louder, pal, louder.
joyce, give the assistant chief inspector a drink, would you?
... remember, counterfeiting is the feds.  they'll be all over abolofia's place.  stick tight. you i.d. the other plate, he does real time.
right.
think we'll get him, nick?
we can't lose.
how can you be so sure?
