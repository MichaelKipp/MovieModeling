dad!
out!
it is important!
then wait -- count to twenty.
no, dad. you listen to me --
junior!
marcus!  i did it!
you have got it!
you know how long I have been looking for that?!
all your life.
all my life!
well done, indy. very well done, indeed. this will find a place of honor in our spanish collection.
your treat.
yes. my treat.
my name is donovan. walter donovan.
i know who you are mr. donovan. your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
well, like yourself, doctor jones, i have a passion for antiquities.  have a look over here. this might interest you.
well, it is sandstone. christian symbol. early latin text. mid-twelfth century, i should think.
that was our assessment as well.
where did this come from?
my engineers unearthed it in the mountain region north of ankara while excavating for copper.  can you translate the inscription?
"where the cup that holds the blood of jesus christ resides forever."
the holy grail, doctor jones. the chalice used by christ during the last supper. the cup that caught his blood at the crucifixion and was entrusted to joseph of arimathaea.
the arthur legend. I have heard this bedtime story before.
eternal life, doctor jones! the gift of youth to whoever drinks from the grail.  oh, now that is a bedtime story I would like to wake up to!
an old man's dream.
every man's dream.  including your father's, i believe.
hard to resist, is not it? the holy grail's final resting place described in detail!
what good is it? this grail tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. pretty vague. where do you start looking? maybe if the tablet were intact, you would have something to go on. but the entire top portion is missing.
just the same, an attempt to recover the grail is currently underway.
let me tell you another "bedtime story," doctor jones. after the grail was entrusted to joseph of arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three knights of the first crusade. three brothers, to be exact.
I have heard this one as well. two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the grail and began the long journey back to france. but only one of them made it. and before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a -- to a franciscan friar, i think.
not "supposedly," doctor jones.
this is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the knight's story... it does not reveal on location of the grail, I am afraid... but the knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would.  this tablet is one of those "markers." it proves the knight's story is true. but as you pointed out -- it is incomplete.  now, the second "marker" is entombed with the knight's dead brother. our project leader believes that tomb to be located within the city of venice, italy.  as you can now see, doctor jones, we are about to complete a great quest that began almost two thousand years ago. we are only one step away.
that is usually when the ground falls out from underneath your feet.
you could be more right than you know.
yes?
we have hit a snag. our project leader has vanished. along with all his research. uh, we received a cable from his colleague, doctor schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what is become of him.  i want you to pick up the trail where he left off. find the man and you will find the grail.
you have got the wrong jones, mister donovan. why do not you try my father?
we already have. your father is the man who is disappeared.
what has the old fool got himself into now?
i do not know. but whatever it is, he is in over his head!
dad?
it is today's mail. and it is been opened.
venice, italy!
what is it?
it is dad's grail diary. every clue he ever followed. every discovery he made. a complete record of his search for the holy grail. this is his whole life. why would he have sent this to me?
i do not know. but someone must want it pretty badly.
do you believe, marcus?
do you believe the grail actually exists?
the search for the cup of christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
but if you want facts, indy, i have none to give you. at my age, I am prepared to take a few things on faith.
call donovan, marcus. tell him I will take that ticket to venice now.
I will tell him we will take two.
tell me, what is going to happen when we get to venice?
do not worry. doctor schneider will be there to meet you.
schneider?
i maintain an apartment in venice, at your disposal.
oh, well. that is good. thank you.
ah, venice...
yes. uh, how will we recognize this doctor schneider when we see him?
i do not know. maybe he will know us.
doctor jones?
yes?
i knew it was you --
and my mother's ears. but the rest belongs to you.
looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
the last time i saw your father we were in the library. he was very close to tracking down the knight's tomb. I have never seen him so excited. he was as giddy as a schoolboy.
who? attila the professor? he was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
fraulein -- will you permit me?
i usually don't.
i usually do not either.
in that case, i permit you.
it would make me very happy.
but I am already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
tomorrow I will steal you another.
that does not look much like a library.
it looks like a converted church.
marcus -- I have seen this window before.
where?
look, indy. the roman numerals!
dad was onto something here!
well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still do not know what they mean.
my dad sent me this diary for a reason. until we find out why, i suggest we keep it to ourselves.
find something?
bingo.
you do not disappoint, doctor jones. you are a great deal like your father.
except he is lost, and I am not.
lower me down.
pagan symbols. fourth or fifth century.
right. six hundred years before the crusades.
the christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.
the ark of the covenant.
are you sure?
pretty sure.
it must be one of these...
look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
what is that?
it is a rubbing dad made of the grail tablet.
would not it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
he never would have made it past the rats! he hates rats! he is scared to death of them!
do not wander off.
what?
i said go around!
you said go between them!
i said do not go between them!
why are you trying to kill us?
because you are looking for the holy grail.
my father was looking for the holy grail. did you kill him too?
no.
where is he? talk -- or you are dead. damn it, tell me! tell me!
if you do not let go, doctor jones, we will both die.
then we will die.
my soul is prepared. how is yours?
this is your last chance.
no, doctor jones. it is yours!
all right! where is my father
if you let me go, i will tell you where he is.
who are you?
my name is kazim.
and why were you trying to kill me?
the secret of the grail has been safe for a thousand years. and for all that time the brotherhood of the cruciform sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
ask yourself, why do you seek the cup of christ? is it for his glory, or for yours?
i did not come for the cup of christ. i came to find my father.
in that case, god be with you in your quest. your father is being held in the castle of brunwald on the austrian-german border.
how is the head?
it is better, now I have seen this. it is the name of a city. "alexandretta?" hmmm...
the present city of iskenderun is built on its ruins. marcus -- you remember what the grail tablet said. "across the desert and through the mountain to the canyon of the crescent moon."  but where exactly?
your father would know. your father did know. look. he made a map.
now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. here. he knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. here. straight to the canyon. he knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
alexandretta. now we know.
yes. now we know.
marcus, get hold of sallah. tell him to meet you in iskenderun.
what about you?
I am going after dad.
my room!
mine, too.
what were they looking for?
this.
the grail diary.
uh-huh.
you had it? you did not trust me!
at least i let you tag along.
oh, yes. give them a flower and they will follow you anywhere.
knock it off. you are not mad.
no?
no. you like the way i do things.
it is lucky i do not do things the same way. you would still be standing at the venice pier.
what do you know about this place?
i know the brunwalds are famous art collectors.
what are you going to do?
do not know. think of something.
are you expected?
do not take that tone with me, my good man. now buttle off and tell baron brunwald that lord clarence macdonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
tapestries?
dear me, the man is dense. this is a castle, is not it? there are tapestries?
this is a castle. and we have many tapestries. but if you are a scottish lord, then i am mickey mouse.
how dare he?!
this one. i think he is in here.
how do you know?
it is you junior!
do not call me that, please.
but what are you doing here?
i came to get you! what do you think?
oh, it breaks the heart.
and the head.  you hit me, dad!
I will never forgive myself --
do not worry -- I am fine.
thank god!
no! dad, get your stuff. we have got to get out of here.
well, i am sorry about your head, though. but i thought you were one of them.
dad, they come in through the doors.
good point.
humpf -- so i was wrong this time. but by god, i was not wrong when i mailed you my diary. you obviously got it.
i got it and i used it. we found the entrance to the catacombs.
through the library?
right.
i knew it. and the tomb of sir richard?
found it.
he was actually there? you saw him?
well, what was left of him.
and his shield... the inscription on sir richard's shield...?
alexandretta.  it is a great moment in henry's life. he turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to indy with joy.
alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the eastern empire. oh, junior...
...you did it.
no, dad. you did. forty years.
if only i could have been with you.
there were rats, dad.
rats?
yeah, big ones. what do the nazis want with you dad?
they want my diary.
yeah?
you didn't, did you?  you did not bring it, did you?
well, uh...
you did!!
look, can we discuss this later?
i should have mailed it to the marx brothers.
will you take it easy!
take it easy?! why do you think i sent it home in the first place?  so it would not fall into their hands!!
i came here to save you.
oh yeah? and who is going to come to save you, junior??
no! do not shoot!
do not worry. he won't.
she ransacked her own room and i fell for it. how did you know she was a nazi?
umh?
how did you she was a nazi?
she talks in her sleep.
donovan!
did not i warn you not to trust anybody, doctor jones?
this book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret canyon of the crescent moon.
so it did.
oh, sallah! what a relief!
marcus brody, sir. and where is indy?
oh, he is in austria. a slight detour.
you are on your own?
yes, but do not panic. everything's under control. have you... have you arranged our supplies?
oh, yes, of course. but where are we going?
oh, this map will show you. it was drawn by, uh...
oh, what?... your servant, sir.
and i am his.
my reputation precedes me.
there is no museum in iskenderun.
yes.
papers, sir. got it here.
yes.
egyptian mail. morning edition.  run!
did you say...? uh, uh...
ooooh... i like the austrian way better.
so did i.
let's try and get these ropes loose. we have got to get to marcus before the nazis do!
you said he had two days' start. that he would blend in. disappear!
are you kidding? -- i made that up! you know marcus -- he got lost once in his own museum!
what am i looking for?
my lucky charm.
feels like a cigarette lighter.
try and burn through the ropes.
i ought to tell you something.
do not get sentimental now dad -- save it 'til we get out of here.
the floor's on fire! see?!
what???
and the chair.
all right, move! move! rock your chair. do what i do.
dad!
what?
dad!
what?
dad!
what?
head for the fireplace!
oh.
this is intolerable!
I am out, dad!
dad!
...the solution presents itself.
come on, dad. come on!
what about the boat? we are not going on the boat?
stop!
what?
stop! stop!
you are going the wrong way! we have to get to berlin!
brody's this way.
my diary's in berlin.
you do not need the diary, dad. marcus has the map.
there is more in the diary than just the map.
all right dad -- tell me.
well, he who finds the grail must face the final challenge.
what final challenge?
three devices of such lethal cunning.
booby traps?
oh, yes. but i found the clues that will safely take us through, in the chronicles of st. anselm.
but what are they? can not you remember?
i wrote them down in my diary so that i would not have to remember.
half the german army's on our tail and you want me to go to berlin? into the lion's den?
yes! the only thing that matters is the grail.
what about marcus?
marcus would agree with me.
two selfless martyrs. jesus christ!
that is for blasphemy. the quest for the grail is not archaeology. it is a race against evil. if it is captured by the nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. do you understand me?
this is an obsession dad. i never understood it. never. neither did mom.
oh yes, she did. only too well. unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all i could do was mourn her.
how did you get here?
where is it? i want it.
you came back for the book? why?
my father did not want it incinerated.
is that what you think of me? i believe in the grail, not the swastika.
yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the grail stands for -- who gives a damn what you think?
you do.
all i have to do is squeeze.
all i have to do is scream.
what did you get?
i do not know. the first available flight out of germany.
good.
when we are airborne, with germany behind us, then I will share that sentiment.
relax.
you know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
that is not all we shared. it is disgraceful. you are old enough to be her fa... er, her grandfather!
well, I am as human as the next man.
i was the next man.
ships that pass in the night...
do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? i had a milk shake.
hmmm... what did we talk about?
we did not talk. we never talked.
and do i detect a rebuke?
a regret. it was just the two of us, dad. it was a lonely way to grow up. for you, too. if you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you would have understood that.
actually, i was a wonderful father.
when?
did i ever tell you to eat up? go to bed? wash your ears? do your homework? no. i respected your privacy and i taught you self-reliance.
what you taught me was that i was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. and i learned it so well that we have hardly spoken for twenty years.
you left just when you were becoming interesting.
dad, how can you?
very well. I am here now.
well... i can not think of anything.
then what are you complaining about?  look, we have work to do. when we get to alexandretta we will face three challenges.  "first, the breath of god. only the penitent man will pass. second, the word of god, only in the footsteps of god will he proceed. third, the path of god, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
what does that mean?
i do not know. we will find out.
i did not know you could fly a plane.
fly... yes. land... no.
dad -- eleven o'clock!!
what happens at eleven o'clock?
dad, are we hit?!
more or less.  son, I am sorry. they got us.
nice landing.
thanks.
those people are trying to kill us!
i know, dad!
it is a new experience for me.
it happens to me all the time.
this is intolerable!
this could be close.
get that camel out of the way!
what happened to marcus, sallah?
ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. i believe they took mister brody with them.
care to wet your whistle, marcus?
I would rather spit in your face. but as i have not got any spit...
well, marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
you are meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
what do you think you are doing?! get down!
dad, we are well out of range.
that car belonged to my brother-in- law.
come on -- come on!
now, who are all these people?
who cares? as long as they are keeping donovan busy. dad, you stay here while sallah and i organize some transportation.
I am going after those horses.
I will take the camels.
i do not need camels.
but, indy --
no camels!
marcus!
arghhh! oh!
henry! what are you doing here?!
it is a rescue, old boy. come on.
sallah, i said no camels! that is five camels. can not you count?
compensation for my brother-in-law's car. indy, your father and brody --
where is my father?
they have them. in the belly of that steel beast.
henry, the pen --
what?
but do not you see? the pen is mightier than the sword.
look what you did!
it is war.
dad?
you call this archaeology?
get out of there, dad!
i never expected to see you again.
I am like a bad penny. i always turn up.
impossible? what do you say, jones? ready to go down in history?
as what? a nazi stooge like you?
nazis?! -- is that the limit of your vision?! the nazis want to write themselves into the grail legend and take on the world. well, they are welcome. but i want the grail itself. the cup that gives everlasting life. hitler can have the world, but he can not take it with him. I am going to be drinking my own health when he is gone the way of the dodo.  the grail is mine, and you are going to get it for me.
shooting me will not get you anywhere.
you know something, doctor jones? you are absolutely right.
dad?!
junior...
"only the penitent man will pass. only the penitent man will pass."
the penitent man will pass. the penitent... the penitent. the penitent man...
the penitent man. the penitent...
the penitent man is humble before god.
penitent. penitent...
the penitent man is humble...
I am through!
we are through!
the word of god...
no, henry. try not to talk.
the name of god...
but in the latin alphabet, "jehovah" begins with an "i".
"j".
indy... indy, you must hurry!! come quickly!
it's... a leap of faith. oh, god.
i knew you would come, but my strength has left me.
who are you?
the last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the grail and to guard it.
that was seven hundred years ago.
a long time to wait.
you are strangely dressed... for a knight.
I am not exactly... a knight. what do you mean?
i was chosen because i was the bravest and the most worthy. the honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. i pass it to you who vanquished me.
elsa! elsa, do not move!
it is ours, indy. yours and mine.
elsa, do not cross the seal. the knight warned us not to take the grail from here.
elsa. elsa don't. elsa. elsa. give me your other hand, honey. i can not hold you.
i can reach it. i can reach it...
junior, give me your other hand! i can not hold on!!
i can get it -- i can almost reach it, dad.
elsa never really believed in the grail. she thought she would found a prize.
what did you find, dad?
me?... illumination.
what did you find, junior?
junior?! dad...
i like indiana.
we named the dog indiana.
may we go home now, please?
the dog!?  you are named after the dog...
ready?
ready.
indy! henry! follow met i know the way!  haaa!
got lost in his own museum, huh?
uh-huh.
after you, junior.
yes, sir!  haaa!
