we are here.  where the hell are you?
back here.  at the end of the block.
you got the cash?
you got the shit?
yeah, but you got to come the rest of the way on foot.  leave your car and walk over here.
let me see it.
let me see it.
where is it?
i can not carry it in my pocket, man.  and i can not go get it for you cause you might be a cop.  you going to have to pick it up yourself.
do not worry.  it is just round the corner. halfway down that block, you can not miss it.  top step of the front stairs, there is a loose stone.  go on, i am not shitting you.
fuck it.  alright.
well, the bad news is we only made 25 bucks each.
how could that be?  the box was packed!
moe's terms.
we practically paying him for the privilege of playing his club.
so what the hell's the good news?
i just accelerated my top secret long term plan for our world domination.
sqweeep.  we innerup this programme to bring you this special news bulletin --  "aliens from reticula 3 have hijacked patrick peet and injected moly headcheese into his skull filling his entire brain cavity with cosmic slop..."
i was planning on waiting until i got the place cleaned out, but -- like the man says, carpe diem.
illibent?  who is club is that?
ours!
looks like a damn graveyard round here.
I am telling you, this neighborhood is coming back.
damn.  that is the ugliest building i have ever seen.
naw.  i think it's... i dunno.  something about it just buzzes me.
and damp, too.  let's not forget damp.
whattaya think?  can you picture it? over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
jimmy bones?
yeah, you heard of him?
you haven't?
not that i remember.
he was a local legend back in the '70's. there was a song, stagolee kinda deal: "this is the ballad of jimmy bones/black as night and hard as stone..."
i was born near here.  my dad's from here.  he never mentioned it.
bones!  how baddass is zat?  this is the place for us.  patrick, you get platinum props, man.  platinum.
yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.
what is your problem with crippled dick?
look around, this place is a dump!  naw, it would have to work to be a dump.
you gotta use your imagination.
"this is patrick..."  "...and this is patrick on crack." imagination, my butt.  even the space cowboy can't...
why do not you all check out the rest?  I am going downstairs and see if i can get the furnace fired up.  warm this place up, you will see.  it has serious potential.
potential toxic dump site.
are you nuts?
the man said just to use my imagination.  let's see...yeah, i get it.  potential. i can see it now.  the first major urban theme park.  village ghetto land. kinda like legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials.  totally e-ticket.
keep smokin', fool.
you did not hear that?  "take him... " something.  "bury him" or...
take who where?  what you smokin'?
's up?
nothing.  contact paranoia.  must be buggin' from hanging with you.
you want us to move in here?
that is the only way we will get the place fixed up in time.
yeah right, and which ever of us is still alive at the end of the week inherits all vincent price's cash.
look, you guys want to play college radio, high school reunions, and some fool's club once a week for the rest of your lives, that is cool.  but i think we can do better.
you soundin' like the old man now.
i believe in you guys.  you are the real shit.  and you know it.  now I am putting everything i got into this cuz i think we can make it happen, but you got to put a little in too.  now all i"m asking is that everybody do their part.  we will move some shit in, and take shifts, or all crash together here --
pat's right.  it will be fun.
tia am not a chick.  she is family.  and do not forget it.
let's get going.  go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
hey, watcha doing with that dog?
he yours, sir?
hell no!
then what do you care?
take my advice.  and shoot that dog.  or let me.
alright.  yes sir.  anything you say.
do not feed that dog.
you people really do not like dogs.
some holes can not be filled.  some hungers can not be satisfied.
and some people need their medication tweaked.
I am not joking boy.  do not feed it. it will only make it hungrier.
need any help with those bags, ma'am?
no thanks.
no really, let us help.  we are new in the neighborhood, going to be neighbors.
you moved into this block?
not really to live, just to play.
that building?
gonna be le hot shit.  pardon my francais.  dance club.  the resurrection brothers play there.  heard of them?
should i?
are they on the radio?
naw.  but they will be.  they are the best.
how do you know?
i manage them.
you look mighty familiar to me.  you sure you are not from around here?
i was born near here.  but after my mother died, my dad moved.  i grew up out in rossmore park.
you are pretty black to be growing up in rossmore park.
guess it is not rossmore park.  thanks for the help.
anytime.  be seeing you.
goddamnit!  how many times i told you --
we got a gift for you, eddie.  fresh new bmw.
that you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  are you crazy? everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on blackstone last night!
but --
how many times i told you, no psycho shit.  there going to be psycho shit, I am the one that does it.
we did not do nothing, eddie.
you gon tell me you did not ginsu those punks and steal their ride?
that is all we did, steal their ride.
get that car the hell away from here, now!  i spend a lot of money to keep the cops cool.  but this is the kinda shit that pisses everybody off.
we just thought...
no more thoughts from your asses.  or i will burn your asses and snort the ashes. hear me?
'sup jimmy b. shotgun.  get back on the curb!  now!
go easy on jay bird.  i can remember when we was his age...
it is all arranged for tonight.  eddie mack's going to be there.  and offisa korruptsky, too.
they get about twelve and a half minutes. tops.
trust me, jimmy, there is big money behind this.  not just big.  big.  like big business big.  big corporation big.  big government big.  our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  nothing but net.
nothing but net?  could be a swish.  or a muthafucking air ball.
one simple word, three little letters. yes.  that is all it is going to take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  big houses, legit business...
that is your dream, homes.  not mine.  i do not want to leave this street.  ever. the status quo is totally cool with me.
maybe i oughtta get there a little early. for good luck.
do not need luck tonight.  I am just letting 'em have their say before i say no.
let me see your hand.
all that shinin' and "reader and adviser" mess.  that was your mama's bag.  i do not know about the readin' but you both can sure 'nuff advise.
my mama's bag and my granma's bag, and a long line of mamas before her.
sounds like mama needs a brand new bag.
left hand's the past.  your right's the present.  and the future.  but it is not written in stone.  it is written in flesh and blood.  and flesh and blood will change.  see?  there is something here, a new line, right across your life line.
must be my clothes line.  no?  how bout my phone line?
no baby.  I am serious.  cancel that meeting.  i got more fruit that needs checking.  come home with me now.
do not you worry about a thing.  this hand's going to be stroking the back of your neck tonight.
not your style.  is it eddie?  killing off your customers?
i am not killed nobody.  shall i rack 'em?  play a game, lupe?
no time for eightball.  i got your tip.
fair enough for the shit.  but i think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
you was just doing your job.
last thing you need's for me to start doing my fucking job.
do not poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  that is all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  i mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
you would not know a mule if it bit you in the ass. and personally, i do not need a mule.  i got a lexus.  and nobody gave it to me --
what the hell do you want?
just a visit with my old pal, jay-bird.
do not call me that.
you certainly traded up.  ...the trophy wife.  nice lookin'.
keep your hands to yourself, willya?
i been watching you.  you done good. invested wisely.  respectable businessman now.  just like you always wanted.
and you?  still a pig.  just a much fatter one.
no reason to get nasty.  yeah, I have stayed in the organization.  but then again i never got the percentage you did.
or you did not know what to do with it.
maybe so.  maybe so.  but that am not why i came to see you.  you sold the building.
what building?
do not shit a shitter.  our building. what did you call it?  his 'tomb'?  we had an agreement.  you were supposed to sit on it.  not sell it --
i did not sell it.
well, somebody bought it.  that is what i heard.
you are right.  one of my associates sold the building last month.
that is a bozo no-no.  jay-bird.
look, even if anyone found anything there, it is twenty years ago.  they could never connect it to us.
you better hope not.  cause it is like they say, four can keep a secret, if three are dead.
nice rack.  how old is --
that is it.  get out.  now!
that is what?
that is some terrible shit.
clean your mouth, or i will.  those boys had no business messing down there.  go places you are not meant to be -- that is what you get.
but that is your old hood, pops.
yeah, and it took some doing to get out of there.  just be glad i did and you can start life from here instead of down there.
but maybe we are the ones who should be down there.  doing something.  making it better.
can not be done.  that place already died and gone to hell.
careful.  that is bad luck.
that place is already bad luck.
why?
no.  it goes way back.  or so my momma says.
what else does she say?
nothing.  you would think she was crazy.  and she is a lot of things, not all of them nice, but crazy momma's not.
way i figure, everything our parents tell us is part true and part total b.s.  and our whole job is figuring out for ourselves which is which.
my momma says every house is two houses. every street, two streets.  there is a whole city, a whole world, kinda beside, on top, just below this one.  the city of the dead.
like right now, there is actually like hordes of dead people shambling around us?  fingers rotting off?
maybe.  but there is an invisible wall, a fabric that kinda keeps things separate.
lucky thing.
yeah.  but when something bad happens, something really bad -- the wall breaks. the fabric tears.
the dead get out?
or the living fall in.  who knows.
and you believe her?
if i did, i would not come within fifty yards of your door.
is it true?
yeah.  he lived there.  and died there, too.
died there?  how?
how the hell should i know?
hey, kid.
yeah?
take my advice.  get the hell out of there.  it is a bad place.  always has been.
shit.
spooked?
no.  well, yeah.  maybe just a little.
yeah, there is a strange vibe here.
where is the others?
maurice left.  tia's taking a bath.
there was not any draft.  that window was closed.
we are all tired.  everybody makes mistakes.  tomorrow in the daylight, everything's going to look different.
i thought you were bringing the colonel?
the gangster of love do not eat no fried chicken.
why not?  he eats everything else.
just what army do you think the colonel was in?  everybody knows the whole chicken distribution network is owned by the klan.  "special recipe".  I am telling you.  there is something in the batter. say it makes a black man sterile.
maurice, even if it was true, what are you worried about?  last time i checked, you were not black.  I am not sure what the hell you are.  but i know you are not a black man.
i am the future.  i am all colors.  all races.  all creeds.  i am the melting pot.  i am the tossed salad.  i am post racial.
post-toasted's more like it.
are not you going to join us?
i have to finish this for class.
you got a vision, girl.  just like i got. just like my momma had.  and the good lord did not give you that vision just for painting pretty pictures.  that is just wasted time.
you mean as opposed to your life?
I am sorry, momma.  maybe next time.
i do not want you meeting around that house.  you stay away from those kids. and away from that dog.
they seemed alright.  bring a little life to that old building.
nothing but a wide world o' pain locked in there.
have you ever been inside?
maybe once upon a time.  but that was long ago.  back before... before it became what it is.
and what is that?
just a bad place.  and the doorway to worse.
"like a heartbeat/like a love beat." listen to the di franco twins there. just the plumbing or something, fool.
maybe there is a pipe underneath the floor.  it leaked and stained.
ugh.  muchos moscos, man.  this is too much.
just some flies.
some flies?  i think this qualifies as way more than "some."
oh yeah, i guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
boys and girls, moms and dads.  children of all ages, I would like you to meet... jimmy bones.
what the hell you talking about?
"this is the story of jimmy bones/black as night and hard as stones/gold plated deuce, like the king of siam/got his switchblade loose, and a diamond on his hand..." there is the switchblade and there is the diamond.  do not know where the deuce is parked.
you think that is really him?
damn.  it is so...fresh.
boy, put that thing down.  you can not take that.  might be evidence.
evidence of what?
somehow i do not think he stabbed himself in the chest, then buried himself too.
shit!  damn dog.  we gonna have to do something about you.
what we have to do is call the police.
yeah, we can.  least till after this weekend.  he am not going nowhere.  we will deal with it then.
whatever, let's just get the hellout of here.
cinn?
what?  oh yeah.  coming.
she does not want me here.  with you.  in this house.
believe me, my old man'd rupture his spleen if he knew we was down here.  all he talks about is the medal he deserves for building us a life as far from this 'hood as possible.
he probably thinks he is saving you from something.  I am sure that is what my mother thinks.
I am sure i can make your mother like me. but then do i got to worry 'bout your father?
i can't.  not yet.
it is alright.  if you want to go home...
no, i want to stay with you guys.  but i can't.  i mean I am not ready.
do not worry about it.  I will stay with the boys.
outta my way, boy.  cinnabar?  I am coming!
why do not you hang on and I will see if she is here.
i know damn well she is there.
you sure got a way with women, bro.  what happened up there?
damned if i know.
where are we going?  you know i hate surprises.
a little business move i made.  on my own.  i think you are going to approve.
what are we doing down here?
like you always said, pop, look for the undervalued.
listen to me, boy.  i did not work all my life to get out of this neighborhood for you to move right back in!
i thought you would be psyched.  just trying to do what you did.  take nothing and make something out of it.
no one'll ever come here.  shut it down. do not worry, the bank'll buy it back. I will take care of it.
you will take care of it?  not this time. no way.  i bought it fair and square. and we open tonight.
bullshit!  bullshit!!  you are selling it back!  that is an order!
got to be an in-ey and got to be smooth. if it is ragged, it was picked too soon. will not ever be ripe.  second, it is got to have just a little give, here.  at the edges.  and last, but not very far from least...  you got to get your nose in it and give it a gooooood, looooong sniff.
i do not know whether to chill you and serve with cottage cheese, or rip you open and eat you right here.
hey jimmy, you know eddie mack, do not you?
we met.
yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at kenwood.  what it is?
what it will be.
you got a nice crib here.
i do alright.  everybody's happy.
but things change.  you gotta think ahead.
what else?  money.
it am not the money - it is the high.  the big fat floating 'what if?'  and it is way more profitable.  nobody ever wins.  so you never have to pay out.
but a two dollar bet is cheaper than a twenty-dollar bag.
yeah, but i am not talking horse.  I am talking about a five-dollar kick in the head that is a quick ticket to heaven. and the fools keep coming back for more.
those 'fools' are my people.
am not no big thang.  it is just a po' man's free base.  here, check it out.
i am not interested.  and if you going to sell it, do not sell it round here.
just try it.
i said, no thanks.
go on.  it will not kill you.
everybody just be cool.  jimmy, man, i think you oughtta hear the deal.
i do not need to hear the deal.  i do not need any partners.  i do not need new product.  and i sure as hell do not need this motherfucker's 'mattie in my face.
what it is?  what it will be, muthafucka.
now you.
no way man...
you cut him, or i shoot you.  make your choice.
sorry, my brother.
since we was just grasshoppers...
you always told me, it is a dog eat dog world.
...i've seen things.  in there.  last night.  you did too.  do not tell me you didn't.  you were crying like a baby.
you said the vision, the images.  they are just that.  just pictures.  they can not hurt you.  that is what you always said.
i lied.
all the more reason i should be here.
please.  it is for your own good.
you said bad things hurt places.  so maybe good things heal them.  good things are happening here.  maybe for the first time ever.  and maybe that is all it takes.
...bones old bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
saw bones old bones on top of the hill. rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
can you take a little extended solo right about now, funk soul brotha?
go for it.
where is the gangsta of love?
probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
well, go find his lazy ass.  i scratch any more tonight I am going to have carpal tunnel syndrome.
it is alright, baby.
who was he, momma?  he tried to kill us.
if he was trying to kill you, you would be dead.
who?  who is he?  what is he?
your father.  he was your father.
you got his hands.  beautiful hands.  i did not even know.  that night.  when they - we - killed him, that you were already alive inside me.  life's like that. grows right out of death.
but if it is him.  if he is really come back, will not he know us?  love us?
sure, if it was really him.  but it is not that simple.  jimmy's body died a long time ago.  and his soul is long gone, and all that is left is that ravening, hungry spirit in the blood that soaked into the house itself, i suppose.
but how do you know?  maybe he just wanted to see us?  and now he is gone again.  and you have all killed my father for the second time.
did you do it?
sure, son.  i went down there and torched the place myself.
you could have had it done.  you did not want us there.
i would not have risked killing you to get you out.  i was trying to protect you.
from what?
why?  why did you give a shit about the building?  why did you care that we were there of all places?
it's...it's a bad neighborhood.  as you can see now.
bullshit, dad.  do not front me.  for once.  just tell me the truth.  i came from there, too.
you were just a kid.
i saw your face.  you knew that place. you knew those people.
that is the past.  it is dead.
dead?  i do not think your past is dead.  it is alive.  and it bites.
looking to score?
unh-unh, little brother.  i got a natural high.  a supernatural high.
hey, eddie mack do not like no wackos on his street.  go be rain man on some other bitch's block.
big bad eddie mack?  got shit for brains and that is a fack.  hey-heh...
you tell my old friend mackie, I will be seeing him.  soon.  real soon.
wh-wh-whooo?
bones.
no?  that mean there is something more left of you than just that hungry spirit? what are you going to do now?  kill us? kill us all?
no.  not...not you.  you i forgive.
you boys been hitting the pipe?
no, eddie.  it is just that, i dunno.  he was tall, and thin, and like a shadow, his face was just a blur.  all i remember is the voice.  it was smooth and low and it did not seem to be comin' out of his mouth.
then how did you hear it, fool?
it was just like in my head.
maybe i oughta open a couple holes in that head and let all them voices out. you will feel better, i promise.
he will kill them.  he will kill every last one of them.
who?
eddie mack, that cop.  and jeremiah.  and even when he is done, who knows.  he will not be satisfied.  just like that demon dog. feed it, and it just grows hungrier. feed his hunger for revenge - he just wants more.  who knows where it will stop. that kind of hunger am not never satisfied.
are not you going to do something about it?
like what?  i got a little power, sure. a touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  but no more than you do.  we are not witches.  i can not wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. besides, maybe they deserve it.  maybe we all do.
i don't.  patrick doesn't.  and his brother and sister don't.  and they are in the house with him.
fine.  maybe i got nothing to lose. 'cept you.
i know it.  the old slaughterhouse.  hey, sal.  that little weasel we popped today?  he is got something for us.  i knew he would once he thought about it.
shit, that was fast.
12-year olds.  they scare easy.  anyway, he is going to tip their stash.  come with me.
I am on my way home.  can you handle it yourself?
oh, no.  please do not make me go by myself.  I am scaaaaaaaaaared.
fuckin' comedian.  see you tomorrow.
we will have to sneak in.
no we won't, momma.  I will just have them call and tell patrick it is us.
girl, they build gates like that to keep people like us out.
told you so.  alright.  we tried.  let's go home.
mother!  no.
why could not you just tell him to let us in?
my old man calls the shots.  he built that gate and these damn walls.
you sure we oughta save him?  why not just let see how safe his gates and walls keep him when his past comes calling?
save him?  what are you talking about?
what it will be.
how did you get in here?
time like this, is that what you really want to know?  how i got the fuck in here?
we can not go back there.  are you crazy? you saw --
it is the only way.  it is possible your father may not be dead yet.
your father was his best friend.  he loved jeremiah.  so he must hate him the most of all now.  he will take his time. but even if it is too late.  if your father is dead.  it is not over.  the door has to be closed.
well, close the fucking door by all means.  but do not expect me to go down there and do it.
i don't.
you am not going down there.  not alone. I will go.
fine.  but I am bringing a couple of friends.
... see there am not just two parts to a person.  there is three.  body-soul and spirit.  the spirit lives in the blood. it is the wanting that holds body and soul together, and sometimes, the wanting lives on.  jimmy's blood must still be in the house.
but the place burned to the ground.
the blood is still there.  we just gotta figure out where.
in his grave there was a cloth or a dress or something.  covered with blood.
my god.  my dress.  we have to find it. and burn it.  and shut the door.
i do not understand it.  you were my man. since we was grasshoppas.  i always looked after you.  you had a piece of everything i had.
i did not want a piece of yours, i wanted my own.
and the hell everybody else, right?
wait, jimmy.  think about it.  you woulda done the same thing if you was me.
no brother.  i wouldn'ta.  i never done a man - any man.  let alone a brother like that.  course, as you can see, no good deed goes unfucked.  now the question is, if the good get fucked, what we got saved up for the bad?  you about to find out.
what will it take?  what do you want? just tell me, jimmy!
aw that is easy.  i want my life back. can you swing that, my brother?
you know i can't.
then fuck it!!!
it is not safe down there.  the fire started down there.  the whole thing could collapse.
then your father's a dead man and jimmy bones is going to be around a long time.
jimmy, you have got --
I have got what i want.  turn around baby, look at me.  look at your man.
i want you to do something for me, baby.
what?
we can climb out.
climb out to where?
anywhere but here.
where are we, baby?
where we will always be...
but.
hush, baby.
is this hell?
or just hell-adjacent...
I am here.
bill!  bill?!
patrick, he's...
okay, okay.  listen:
here, find my hand.  the stairs are right near here.  i saw them.  let's just walk up there.
i can not find you.
here!
please...help me...
dad?
help me.  I am so sorry.  but please, help me...
daddy?
we gotta jump!
i can't!
