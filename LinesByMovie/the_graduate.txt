I am just --
-- worried?
well --
about what?
i guess -- about my future.
what about it?
i do not know. i want it to be --
to be what?
different.
is anything wrong?
no! no -- we are just on our way downstairs!
the carlsons' are here.
they are?  come on.
they came all the way from tarzana.
it is a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
ben!
excuse me.  mr. mcquire.
ben.
mr. mcquire.
ben -- i just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
yes, sir.
are you listening?
yes i am.
plastics.
exactly how do you mean?
there is a great future in plastics. think about it. will you think about it?
yes, i will.
okay. enough said. that is a deal.
oh. i guess this is not the bathroom, is it?
it is down the hall.
how are you, benjamin?
fine, thank you. the bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
is there an ashtray in here?
no.
oh -- i forgot. the track star does not smoke.
is it a girl?
is what a girl?
whatever it is you are upset about.
oh -- no. I am just sort of disturbed about things.
in general.
that is right.
benjamin, i want to ask you something.
what?
will you take me home?
what?
my husband took the car. will you drive me home?
you don't?
no.
let's go.
thank you.
right.
will you come in, please?
what?
i want you to come in till i get the lights on.
what for?
because i do not feel safe until i get the lights on.
would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. i feel funny about coming into a dark house.
but it is light in there now.
please.
what do you drink? bourbon?
look -- i drove you home. i was glad to do it. but i have some things on my mind. can you understand that?
all right then.
what do you drink?
benjamin -- I am sorry to be this way, but i do not want to be alone in this house.
why not?
please wait till my husband gets home.
when is he coming back?
i do not know.
drink?
no.
are you always this much afraid of being alone?
yes.
well, why can not you just lock the doors and go to bed?
I am very neurotic.
what do you think of me?
what do you mean?
you have known me nearly all of your life. you must have formed some opinion.
well -- I have always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
did you know i was an alcoholic?
what?
did you know that?
look -- i think i should be going --
sit down, benjamin.
mrs. robinson -- if you do not mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. now I am sure that mr. robinson will be here any minute and --
no.
what?
my husband will be back quite late.
oh my god.
pardon?
oh no, mrs. robinson, oh no.
what is wrong?
mrs. robinson, you did not -- i mean you did not expect --
what?
i mean -- you did not really think that i would do something like that.
like what?
what do you think?
well i do not know.
for god's sake, mrs. robinson, here we are, you have got me into your house. you give me a drink. you put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband will not be home for hours.
so?
mrs. robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
are not you?
why no. i had not thought of it. i feel rather flattered that you --
mrs. robinson, will you forgive me for what i just said?
it is all right.
it is not all right, it is the worst thing I have ever said to anyone.
sit down.
please forgive me. because i like you. i do not think of you that way. but I am mixed up.
all right. now finish your drink.
mrs. robinson, it makes me sick that i said that to you.
we will forget it right now. finish your drink.
what is wrong with me?
have you ever seen elaine's portrait?
her portrait?
yes.
no.
we had it done last christmas. would you like to see it?
very much.
i do not remember her as having brown eyes.
benjamin?
yes?
will you unzip my dress?
i think I will go to bed.
oh. well, goodnight.
will not you unzip my dress?
I would rather not, mrs. robinson.
if you still think I am trying to seduce you --
no, i don't. but i just feel a little funny.
benjamin -- you have known me all your life.
i know that. but I am --
come on.
thank you.
right.
what are you so scared of?
I am not scared, mrs. robinson.
then why do you keep running away?
because you are going to bed. i do not think i should be up here.
have not you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
yes, i have --
but i just -- look -- what if mr. robinson walked in right now?
what if he did?
well, it would look pretty funny, would not it?
do not you think he trusts us together?
of course he does. but he might get the wrong idea. anyone might.
i do not see why. I am twice as old as you are. how could anyone think --
but they would! do not you see?
benjamin -- I am not trying to seduce you. i wish you would --
i know that. but please, mrs. robinson. this is difficult for me.
why is it?
because i am confused about things. i can not tell what I am imagining. i can not tell what is real. i can not --
would you like me to seduce you?
what?
is that what you are trying to tell me?
I am going home now. i apologize for what i said. i hope you can forget it. but I am going home right now.
benjamin?
yes.
will you bring up my purse before you go?
i have to go now. I am sorry.
i really do not want to put this on again. will not you bring it up?
where is it?
on that chair in the hall.
mrs. robinson?
I am in the bathroom.
well here's the purse.
could you bring it up?
well I will hand it to you.
come to the railing and I will hand it up.
benjamin -- i am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. now if you will not do me a simple favor i do not know what.
I am putting it on the top step.
for god's sake, benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?
I am putting it here by the door.
will you bring it in to me?
I would rather not.
all right. put it in the room where we were.
right.
do not be nervous.
get away from that door.
i want to say something first.
jesus christ!
benjamin -- i want you to know I am available to you. if you will not sleep with me this time --
oh my god.
if you will not sleep with me this time, benjamin, i want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we will make some kind of arrangement.
let me out!
do you understand what i said?
yes. yes. let me out!
because i find you very attractive and any time --
i drove -- i drove mrs. robinson home. she wanted me to drive her home so i -- i drove her home.
swell. i appreciate it.
she is upstairs. she wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
standing guard over the old castle, are you?
yes, sir.
here. it looks like you need a refill.
oh no.
what?
I have got to go.
is anything wrong? you look a little shaken up.
no. no -- I am just -- I am just a little worried about my future. I am a little upset about my future.
thank you very much, sir.
ben -- how old are you now?
twenty. I will be twenty-one next week.
that is a hell of a good age to be.
thank you.
i wish i was that age again. because, ben --
sir?
you will never be young again.
i know.
ben, can i say something to you?
what?
how long have we known each other now?
how long have you and i known each other? how long have your dad and i been partners?
quite a while.
I have watched you grow up, ben.
yes, sir.
in many ways i feel as though you were my own son.
thank you.
so i hope you will not mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
I would like to hear it.
ben -- i think -- i think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to.
yes, i do.
I have got to go.
you have yourself a few flings this summer. i bet you are quite a ladies' man.
oh no.
what? you look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off.  does not he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?
oh say -- elaine gets down from berkeley on saturday.
oh yes.
ben -- i want you to give her a call.
i will.
great.
benjamin?
yes.
thank you for taking me home.
are you ready in there, feature attraction?
could i speak to you for a second, dad?
dad -- could we just talk about this for a second?
twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --
i can not hold them much longer, ben. you better get out here.
I would like to discuss this.
this boy -- I am sorry -- this young man -- is soon to continue his education as a frank halpingham award scholar -- but before he does --
-- before he does --  you are disappointing them, ben. you are disappointing them.
dad -- can you listen --
I will give you ten seconds.  he is going to give us a practical demonstration of what i feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present -- and it better work or I am out over two hundred bucks -- so let's hear it for --
hello.
mrs. robinson -- i do not quite know how to put this --
benjamin?
look -- i was thinking about that time after the party --
where are you?
-- and i was wondering if i could buy you a drink or something --
where are you?
uh -- the taft hotel.
did you get a room?
no. now i know it is pretty late and if you would rather --
give me an hour.
what?
I will be there in an hour.
can i help you, sir!
what? oh -- no -- I am just --
what?
the singleman party, sir?
oh -- yes. the singleman party.
it is in the main ballroom.
ahh -- thank you.
no -- actually I am not --
I would like you to know my sister, miss dewitte --
braddock -- braddock?
yes, but I am afraid --
I will find your table in a moment. braddock. not braniff? we have a braniff.
no -- actually I am just looking for a friend.
I am afraid i do not understand.
I am not with your party -- I am sorry.
hey -- i do not get it.
hello, benjamin.
oh. hello. hello.
may i sit down?
of course.
how are you?
very well. thank you.
may i have a drink?
a drink? of course.
he did not see me.
waiter!
you do not have to be so nervous, you know.
nervous. well, i am a bit nervous. i mean it is -- it is pretty hard to be suave when you are --
did you get us a room?
what?
have you gotten us a room yet?
i haven't. no.
do you want to?
well -- i don't. i mean i could. or we could just talk.
do you want me to get it?
you? oh no. no. I will get it.
do you want to get it now?
now?
yes.
well -- i do not know.
why do not you get it.
why do not i get it? well -- i will then.  if you will excuse me.
yes sir?
a room. I would like a room, please.
a single room or a double room?
a single. just for myself, please.
will you sign the register, please?
is anything wrong, sir?
what? no. nothing.
do you have any luggage, mister --  gladstone?
luggage? yes. yes. i do.
where is it?
what?
where is your luggage?
well it is in the car. it is out in the car.
very good, sir. I will have a porter bring it in.
oh no.
sir?
i mean I would -- I would rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. i just have a toothbrush. i can get it myself. if that is all right.
of course.
I will have a porter show you the room.
oh. well actually, I would just as soon find it myself. i just have the toothbrush to carry up and i think i can manage it myself.
whatever you say, sir.
hello.
mrs. robinson?
yes?
it is benjamin.
yes?
benjamin braddock.
benjamin -- where are you?
can you look through the glass.
can you see me now?
yes, i can.
i got a single room.
that is fine.
but there is one thing. the desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. i mean -- i do not know what their policy is -- but --
well -- do you want to go up first?
yes -- i think that would be good.
I will be up in five minutes.
well -- goodbye then --
benjamin.
yes?
is not there something you want to tell me?
to tell you?
yes.
well -- i want you to know how much i appreciate this -- really --
the number.
what?
the room number, benjamin. i think you ought to tell me that.
oh? you are absolutely right. absolutely. it is 512.
thank you.
you are welcome. well -- I will see you later, mrs. robinson.
i say I have got it.
sir?
the toothbrush. i got it all right.
very good, sir.
yes. well -- goodnight.
goodnight, sir.
well.
benjamin.
yes?
I will get undressed now. is that all right?
sure. shall i -- i mean shall i just stand here? i mean -- i do not know what you want me to do.
why do not you watch?
oh -- sure. thank you.
will you bring me a hanger?
what?
a hanger.
oh -- yes. wood?
what?
wood or wire? they have both.
either one will be fine.
okay.
thank you.
you are welcome.
would this be easier for you in the dark?
mrs. robinson -- i can not do this.
you what?
this is all terribly wrong.
benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
oh no, mrs. robinson. i think -- i think you are the most attractive of all my parents' friends. i just do not think we could possibly --
are you afraid of me?
no -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, mrs. robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
benjamin, is this your first time?
is this -- what?
it is, is not it? it is your first time.
that is a laugh, mrs. robinson. that is really a laugh. ha ha.
you can admit that, can not you?
are you kidding?
it is nothing to be ashamed of --
wait a minute!
on your first time --
who said it was my first time?
that you are afraid --
wait a minute.
-- of bring -- inadequate -- i mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
inadequate!
why?
well -- it is very comfortable -- just to drift here.
have you thought about graduate school?
no.
would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? what was the point of all that hard work?
you got me.
now listen, ben. i think it is a very good thing that a young man -- after he is done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. but after a few weeks i believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.
hi, ben. what are you doing with yourself these days?
oh -- not too much. taking it easy.
that is what I would do if i could. nothing wrong with that. hey ben, elaine's coming down from berkeley soon. i want you to call her up this time.
i will.
because i just think you two would hit it off real well together.
say hello to mrs. robinson, benjamin.
hello, mrs. robinson.
can i talk to you a minute?
sure.
benjamin? I am going to ask you something but you do not have to tell me if you do not want.
what?
well I am going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
when i go off?
you do not have to tell me if you do not want.
no, i do. i want to tell you.
i drive around.
what else?
nothing else.
well you do not drive around from midnight until noon the next day, benjamin.
oh, no.
then what do you do? do you meet someone?
meet someone?
why did you say that?
well this is your business, benjamin.  if you --
no wait. wait.
i do not meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
benjamin, I am not going to pry into your affairs, but I would rather you did not say anything at all than be dishonest. goodnight, benjamin.
well, wait.
well why do you -- why do you think that?
because i know you do not drive around for twelve hours.
oh. well, i don't. shall i tell you what i do?
not if you do not want to.
i do.
but i do not want you to make up something.
I am not. but I am -- I am not very proud of what i do. i usually get kind of drunk. i usually drive over to los angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. then i take a hotel room. so i will not have to drive home on the freeway. i mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
goodnight, benjamin.
you believe me, do not you?
no.
you don't?
but i want you to. please. please will you believe me.
goodnight.
now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
if you want.
good. i mean are we dead or something?
well i just do not think we have much to say to each other.
all we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
are you tired of it?
I am not. no. but do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
well what do you want to talk about?
anything. anything at all.
do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
oh my god.
well?
mrs. robinson. if that is the best we can do let's just get the goddamn clothes off and --
leave it on! now we are going to do this thing. we are going to have a conversation. think of another topic.
how about art.
art. that is a good subject. you start it off.
you start it off. i do not know anything about it.
oh.
do not you?
yes i do. i know quite a bit about it.
go ahead then.
art. well what do you want to know about it.
are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
neither.
you are not interested in art?
no.
then why do you want to talk about it?
i don't.
can i take off my clothes now?
no. think of another topic. tell me what you did today.
do you really want me to?
yes i do.
i got up.
do you want to hear it or not?
yes. but you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
i got up. i ate breakfast and went shopping. during the afternoon i read a novel.
what one.
what?
what novel did you read.
i do not remember.
then i fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
there!
what?
your husband! mrs. robinson! there is something we could have a conversation about.
him?
i mean everything. i do not know anything about how you -- how you work this. i do not know how you get out of the house at night. i do not know the risk involved.
there is not any.
there is no risk?
how do you get out of the house?
i walk out.
you walk right out the door.
what do you say to him?
he is asleep.
always?
benjamin, this is not a very interesting topic.
please. now tell me. how do you know he will not wake up sometime and follow you.
because he takes sleeping pills. he takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
but what about the noise from the car. what if --
the driveway's on my side of the house.
we are talking.
what?
we are talking, mrs. robinson. we are talking.
calm down, benjamin.
now let's keep going here.
can i undress and talk at the same time?
right.
thank you.
now. you say the driveway's on your side of the house. so i guess you do not sleep in the same room.
we don't.
so you do not -- i mean i do not like to seem like I am prying but i guess you do not sleep together or anything.
no we don't.
well how long has this been going on.
about five years.
oh no. are you kidding me?
no.
you have not slept with your husband for five years?
now and then. he gets drunk a few times a year.
how many times a year.
on new year's eve. sometimes on his birthday.
man, is this interesting.
is it?
so you do not love him. you would not say you --
we have talked enough, benjamin.
wait a minute. so you would not say you loved him.
not exactly.
but you do not hate him.
no, benjamin. i do not hate him. unhook my blouse.
well how do you feel about him, then?
i don't.
well that is kind of a bad situation then, is not it?
is it?
i mean it does not sound like it could be much worse. if you hated him at least you would hate him.
well you loved him once, i assume. when you first knew him.
no.
what?
i never did, benjamin. now let's --
well, wait a minute. you married him.
why did you do that?
see if you can guess.
well i can't.
think real hard, benjamin.
i can not see why you did, unless... you did not have to marry him or anything, did you?
do not tell elaine.
oh no. you had to marry him because you got pregnant?
are you shocked?
well i never thought of you and mr. robinson as the kind of people who...
all right. now let's get to bed.
wait a minute. wait a minute. so how did it happen?
what?
i mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
not particularly.
was he a law student at the time?
and you were a student also.
yes.
at college.
yes.
what was your major?
why are you asking me all this?
because I am interested, mrs. robinson. now what was your major subject at college?
art.
art?
but i thought you -- i guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
kind of.
well how did it happen?
how do you think.
i mean did he take you up to his room with him? did you go to a hotel?
benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
I am curious.
we would go to his car.
oh no. in the car you did it?
i do not think we were the first.
what kind of car was it?
what?
do you remember the make of the car?
oh my god.
really. i want to know.
it was a ford, benjamin.
a ford! a ford! goddamnit, a ford! that is great!
that is enough.
so old elaine robinson got started in a ford.
do not talk about elaine.
do not talk about elaine?
no.
why not?
because i do not want you to.
i wish you would tell me.
there is nothing to tell.
well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?
well -- i guess I will have to ask her out on a date and find out what is --
benjamin, do not you ever take that girl out.
do you understand that?
well look. i have no intention of taking her out.
good.
i was just kidding around.
good.
but why should not i?
i have my reasons.
then let's hear them.
no.
let's hear your reasons, mrs. robinson. because i think i know what they are.
I am not good enough for her to associate with, am i? I am not good enough to even talk about her, am i?
let's drop it.
we are not dropping it. now that is the reason, is not it? I am a dirty degenerate, are not i? I am not fit to --
benjamin?
I am good enough for you but I am too slimy to associate with your daughter. that is it, is not it? is not it?
yes.
you go to hell. you go straight to hell, mrs. robinson. do you think I am proud of myself? do you think I am proud of this?
i would not know.
well, I am not.
you are not.
no sir. i am not proud that i spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
i see.
and if you think i come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you are all wrong.
because -- mrs. robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. and you do what you want but I am getting the hell out.
are you?
you are goddamn right i am.
that I am a sick and disgusting person.
now do not start this.
what?
do not start acting hurt.
do not you expect me to be a little hurt?
mrs. robinson, you stand there and tell me I am not good enough for your daughter.
did i say that?
of course you did.
benjamin, i want to apologize to you if that is the impression you got.
well two minutes ago you told me i was not good enough for your daughter. now you say you are sorry i got that impression.
i did not mean it. i do not think you would be right for each other. but i would never say you were not as good a person as she is.
you wouldn't.
of course i wouldn't.
what are you doing?
well it is pretty obvious you do not want me around any more.
well look -- i was kind of upset there.  I am sorry i said those things.
if that is how you feel --
but it is not.
that is all right. i think i can understand why I am disgusting to you.
oh no.  look -- i like you. i would not keep coming here if i did not like you.
but if it is sickening for you --
it is not! i enjoy it! i look forward to it. it is the one thing i have to look forward to.
you do not have to say that.
well i wouldn't. i would never say it if it was not true.
may i stay then?
yes. please. i want you to.
thank you.
well do not thank me, because i want you to.
look. why the hell did you bring this up. it never occurred to me to take her out.
then give me your word you won't.
this is absurd.
promise me, benjamin.
all right, for christ's sake. i promise i will never take out elaine robinson.
thank you.  benjamin --
let's not talk about it. let's not talk at all.
it is pretty embarrassing. i really do not know what to tell mr. robinson. it is awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up elaine.
next time he suggests it, I will tell him i have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
i guess she is not good enough for you, is that it?
look -- elaine robinson and i do not get along.
how do you know? you have not seen her since high school. i guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
that has nothing to do with it --
i guess I will just tell mr. robinson that you are just too busy every evening -- doing god knows what --
do not go on like this. now if benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
i do.
-- then I will simply invite all the robinsons' over for dinner on thursday.
hello.
what would you say to a short one? bourbon still your drink?
yes.
now listen -- this was not my idea. it was my father's idea.
benjamin -- i thought i made myself perfectly clear about this.
look, we will go out to dinner and have a drink and I will bring her back. because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. and I am afraid i could not quite handle that, if you do not mind. i have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. so do not get upset about it.
but i am. I am extremely upset about it, benjamin.
hello.
hello.
you are living at home now. is that right?
yes.
do you know what you are going to do?
no.
are you going to graduate school?
no.
do you always drive like this?
yes.
do you want some dinner?
I would love some.
are not you eating?
no.
why not?
if it is all right with you, I am not hungry.
benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
no -- why should i?
i do not know.
could you do it?
no.
will you take me home now?
I am sorry i took you in there.
i think I would better go home now please.
but, elaine --
where is the car?
i just want to tell you something.
i want to go home.
but could i just tell you this one thing?
what?
this whole idea -- this date and everything. it was my parents' idea. they forced me into it.
oh -- that is very nice of you to tell me.
no. what i mean is -- that is why I have been acting this way. I am not like this. i hate myself like this.
listen -- could you stop crying, please?
no, i couldn't.
but could you try?
no.
I have had this feeling -- ever since I have graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that i have to be rude all the time. do you know what i mean?
yes, i do.
would you like to come in? i could make some coffee.
no, i mean -- i would not want to wake anyone up.
we won't. let's go inside.
wait a minute.
is anything wrong?
no -- i was just thinking -- look -- it is still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
all right.
where we going?
I am trying to think of where there is a place to have a drink around here.
is not there one in the taft hotel?
what is the matter?
nothing. I am just wondering if they have a bar or not. i mean let's go see. let's go see if they do or not.
listen, elaine -- it seems to me that there is not a bar in here. i mean -- as far as i know.
of course there is. look -- the veranda room -- right there.
benjamin --
let's get out of here, elaine. let's go somewhere else.
benjamin -- do they know you?
of course not.
ben -- what is happening? who is mr. gladstone?
i do not know. they must think i look like this guy gladstone.
do you?
yes.
you are the first -- you are the first thing for so long that I have liked. the first person i could stand to be with.
I am sorry. that is not my business.
it just happened. it was just this thing that happened along with everything else. can you understand that?
was she married or something?
yes.
with a family?
yes. she had a husband and a son.
did they ever find out?
no.
and it is all over now.
yes.
I am glad.
all right.
during the day? we will go for a drive or something.
okay.
you sure you really want to?
yes.
because i would not want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
i do.
you do?
benjamin -- i really do.
drive down the block.
mrs. robinson -- i have a date with elaine. we are going for a drive.
do exactly what i say.
now it seems to me --
listen to me very carefully, benjamin. you are not to see elaine again. ever. those are my orders. is that clear?
mrs. robinson --
i can makes things quite unpleasant.
how?
in order to keep elaine away from you -- i am prepared to tell her everything.
i do not believe you.
then you would better start believing me.
mrs. robinson, do not wreck it. I am asking you please not to wreck it.
go home now.
i just do not believe you would do that.
what is the matter?
you have got to go over the back fence and I will meet you on the corner.
benjamin -- what is happening?
hurry up. put your shoes on.
why are not you ready?
because i want to know what is happening.
what is it?
that woman --
what?
that woman. the older woman.
you mean the one who --
yes. the married woman -- it was not just some woman --
elaine --
oh my god --
no -- do not cry --
get out!
do not cry.
get out of here.
say that again.
I am going to marry elaine robinson.
what is happening?
ben says he and elaine are getting married.
i do not believe it.
that what he says. right?
I am going up to berkeley today.
oh, ben -- this is so -- exciting --
come on, let's call the robinsons. we have got something to celebrate.
no. i think you will want to wait on that.
they do not know?
no -- they don't.
well -- when did you decide all this?
about an hour ago.
wait a minute. you talked to elaine this morning?
no. she does not know about it.
she does not know that you are coming up to berkeley?
no. actually -- she does not know about us getting married yet.
when did you two talk this over?
we haven't.
ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
no -- it is not. it is completely baked. it is a decision I have made.
you a student?
not exactly.
what is that?
i said -- not exactly -- no.
what are you then?
well -- I am just sort of traveling through.
i like to know who is living in my house. i like to know what my boys are up to.
ahhh.
you are not one of those agitators?
what?
one of those outside agitators.
oh -- no sir.
i hate that. i will not stand for it.
I am meeting someone.
ah. where?
where are you meeting this person?
at the zoo.
the zoo. they have a pretty good one here, do they?
I have never been to it.
oh. well, i have not either. i might just ride out there with you.
is that him over there?
no.
where did he say he was going to meet you?
i thought he said by the monkey house.
oh.
benjamin -- i would like to know what you are doing here.
here? in berkeley?
yes.
well, i have this very pleasant room on carter street -- and I have been getting to some classes --
but you are not enrolled.
no. i just sit in. they do not seem to mind. they have been very congenial about it.
benjamin -- you are -- i do not know what to say -- you are --
maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
-- really incredible --
here he comes.
what?
I have got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
i want to ask you a question.
come in.
no. i want to know why you are here in berkeley?
because -- i am.
is it because I am here?
what do you think?
i think it is.
i said i think it is.
all right then! yes!
well, i want you to leave.
elaine -- i love you.
how could you do that, benjamin?
do you just hate everything? how could you possibly rape my...
what?
i do not understand --
did you say rape her?
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
what did she say?
let me go.
you have got to tell me what she said.
why?
because it is not true.
i do not feel well.
she said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. you waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
then what?
then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
elaine -- that is not what happened.
please let me go.
all right -- but listen to me. what happened was there was this party at my parents. i drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
do not tell me --
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
benjamin -- this is my mother!
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- i mean really naked --
oh -- hello, mr. mccleery.
who screamed?
it is all right, mr. mccleery.
screaming is not all right. not in my house it isn't.
it was just a visitor. but it is all right now.
what did you do to her?
look -- she is all right. she is upset and she screamed. but she is okay now.
see -- she is just having some water. now there is no need for the cops or anything.
all right, boys -- i think you can get back to your rooms. i do not think we will have any more of this agitation. will we, braddock?
no, sir.
mr. mccleery?
you heard me. out of here.
what for?
because i do not like you.
benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
elaine -- right now i do not feel like talking much. I am sorry about everything but i think I will just do this now.
can i just sit here while you are packing?
if you want.
what are you looking for?
my belt.
do not you have it on?
no. i have two. the other one is the one I am looking for.  what is this?  it is from my grandmother.
the marble?
the belt I am looking for was from my grandmother.
oh.
what are you going to do now?
i do not know.
are you going home?
no.
well -- where are you going?
i do not want you to leave tomorrow.
i do not understand.
i do not want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
but elaine --
goodbye.
benjamin?
what?
will you kiss me!
you won't?
i do not know.
but you might.
i might.
is that so? you might marry me?
yes.
when?
i do not know.
how about tomorrow? i do not mean to be pushy but --
i do not know. i do not know what is happening.
you mean you are confused?
well -- look -- do not be confused. we are getting married.
i do not see how we can.
we just can.
i have to go back now.
elaine -- are you serious about this?
I will think about it.
you really will?
yes.
we could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
tomorrow?
or this afternoon. it is a good day for it.
benjamin -- i have not even said I will marry you yet.
we will need our birth certificates. i happen to have mine with me. where is yours?
i just do not think it would work.
why would not it?
why would not it?
i just do not think it would...
why do not you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
why do not i just drag you off? all right -- i will. right after we get the blood tests.
well -- i have to see carl first.
carl who?
carl who?
carl smith. he is a medical student. we have known him for years.
who -- that guy at the zoo?
yes.
why do you have to see him?
well -- i said i might marry him.
how did he do it? did he get down on his knees? he did not get down on his knees, i hope.
no, benjamin.
well, what did he say? I am curious.
he said he thought we would make a pretty good team.
oh no. he said that.
shhhh.
where did he do it?
are we getting married tomorrow?
no.
the day after tomorrow?
maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
mr. robinson?
do you have a special grudge against me? do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
no, it is not --
is there something I have said that is caused this contempt? or is it just the things i stand for that you despise?
it was nothing to do with you, sir.
well, ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
now look -- please --
ben, i think we are two civilized human beings. do you think it is necessary to threaten each other?
i am not threatening you.
do you want to unclench your fists, please? thank you. i can see in the dark, you know. I have been here quite a while.
i am trying to tell you i have no personal feelings about you, mr. robinson. i am trying to tell you i do not resent you.
you do not respect me terribly much either, do you?
no, i don't.
well, i do not think we have a whole lot to say to each other, ben. i do think you should know the consequences of what you have done. i do think you should know that my wife and i are getting a divorce soon.
but why?
why?
it should not make any difference what happened.
that is quite a statement.
listen to me. we got -- we got into bed with each other. but it was nothing. it was nothing at all. we might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
shaking hands. well, that is not saying much for my wife, is it?
you miss the point.
do not shout at me, ben.
the point is -- i do not love your wife. i love your daughter, sir.
well -- I am sure you think you do, ben, but after a few times in bed with elaine i feel quite sure you would get over that as quickly as you --
huh?
i think I have talked about this enough. i do not know how far i can go, ben. i do not know if i can prosecute or not, but i think maybe i can. in the light of what is happened i think maybe i can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. i have seen elaine and i have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...
mr. mccleery -- do you have some change? i need to use the phone?
i want you out of here.
look -- I will give you ten dollars for a dime -- I will give you twenty -- for god's sake, will you let me use that phone?
i am going to call the police now.
could i make one phone call first?
get out!
hello. get me the police, please.
where is elaine?
I will be with you in a moment, benjamin.  will you send a police car to twelve hundred glenview road. we have a burgler here. just a second. I will ask him.  are you armed?  no -- i do not believe he is. thank you.
what have you done to her?
i think we have everything quite under control now, benjamin. would you like a quick drink before you go?
you can not stop me from seeing her, mrs. robinson. I will find her.
I am sorry we will not be able to invite you to the wedding, benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
what the hell have you done?
ahh. i do not think you will have time for that drink after all.
I will find her.
i do not think so.
657-2036
hello -- who is this?
this is dr. smith's answering service.
is the doctor anywhere?
well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I am sure it is over by now. he should be checking in any moment --
listen to me. i am dr. smith's brother -- reverend smith -- and i am supposed to perform the ceremony. i just got in -- from -- portland -- and I have forgotten what church -- you see?
oh.  well -- I am not sure -- but you might try the first presbyterian. that is on allan street.
thank you.
i certainly hope you --
benjamin?
what?
