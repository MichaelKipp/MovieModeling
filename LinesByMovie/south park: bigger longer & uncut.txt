aw, screw it. it probably isn't all that good anyway.
cartman! what the hell are you talking about?! you love terrance and philiip!
yeah, but the animation's all crappy - it probably can't sustain itself over ninety minutes.
purpre mama!

where do they come up with this stuff?!
how come terrance and phillip are so weird looking?
cuz, dummy they're canadian, just like ike!

<b>shut your fucking face, unclefucka!! you're an asslicking, ball sucking unclefucka!! you're an unclefucka, yes it's true nobody fucks uncles quite like you-</b>
<b>shut your fucking face!! unclefucka!!! you're the one that fucked your uncle, unclefucka!!! you don't eat, or sleep or mow the lawn you just fuck your uncle all day long!</b>

<b>thank my lucky stars here before me now is everything i'd ever hoped for knew it in a word saw it in a glance the only thing i think i'd die for...</b>
aw, god damn it, he's singing that fucking song again.
who are you, kid?
my name is gregory. i have been wendy's counter-cousin for some time.
we saw the terrance and phillip movie!
that's nice, stan.
woa, dude, who's your girlfriend's new guy?
she's not my girlfriend, dude!
well, anyway... today children, our friend mr. hat is going to tell us all about the environment.
that's right, mr. garrison. the environment is what surrounds us. it is what we live and breathe.
i hate the environment.
dude, how can you hate the environment?
'cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. i fucking hate it.
eric! did you just say the "f" word?
fragile?
why the fuck not?
eric!
fuckin' a right.
how would you like to go to the principal's office?
how would you like to gargle rat jiz?
what did you say?!?!
i said -
now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the terrance and phillip movie!
yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
nowhere.
i've heard them from mr. garrison a few times before...
yeah!
what did my son say, principal victoria? did he say the s word?
no, it was worse than that...
the f word?!
no, worse. here's a short list of the things they've been saying.
oh dear god...
what is 'fisting'?
what?
young man, you will tell peincipal victoria this instant where you heard all these horrible phrases!
i can't dude! we all took a sacred oath, and swore ourselves to secrecy!
it was the terrance and phllip movie!
dude!
what? fuck you guys, i wanna get out of here.
terrance and phillip movie?! oy gevalt! not again!
what is terrance and phillip?
terrance and phillip are two very untalented, unfunny actors from canada. their tv show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  now it appears they have a movie and i'm positive it's not suitable for children!
well, it looks like i'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. i have to put a stop to this before more children see 'terrance and phillip'.
we must take action on this immediately.
ooh yes. i think we'll have to give detention to those boys.
forgive me for saying so, principal victoria, but your methods are too... shall we say... soft?  as head of the pta, i am exercising my right under article 42 of the pta code.
article 42!  you don't mean-?!
yes principal victoria.  the pta is impeaching you.
but i-
you are officially relieved of your duties as principal of this school!
oh but of course children are going to see it!!
uh, can i finish? can i finish? ...the fact is that we canadians are quite surprised by your outrage-
you just don't care!
can i finish? hello? can i finish? ...the united states has graphic images of violence on television all the time, what is that one show? cops? and car crashes caught on tape? we can't believe that a movie with some foul language and fart jokes would piss you off so much.
because it's evil!!
can i finish? please? can i finish? ... ... uh... okay, i'm finished.
what?
the canadians are just mad that we mothers here in south park have the chutzpah to stand up to them!  like it or not, mr. canadian minister, our children are now safe from your canadian smut!
well, terrance i hope you learned something from this whole experience.
i did, terrance, i learned that you are a boner biting dick fart fuck face!
say phillip, want to see the northern lights?
you bet, terrance!
ha ha ha! you burned yourself to death by lighting the fart! ha ha ha!!
i sure did, phillip!!
did you see that, wendy?
yup.
man, that movie gets better every time i see it!
yeah, but you know what? that whole part about lighting farts is bullshit. you can't do that.
mph rmpmh rm.
no way.
didn't you think it was funny, wendy?
stan... i think you and i need some time apart.
<u>what?!</u>
dude, anybody who doesn't think terrance and phillip is funny can fuck off anyways.
yeah...
mph rmph rm!!
no you can't kenny!
mph rm rmph!!
okay kenny, i'll bet you a hundred dollars you can't light a fart on fire!
mph mm!
oh my god!! you killed kenny!!
you bastard!!
oh my god! they killed kenny!
you bastards!!
i knew this would happen! those bastard canadians have now killed a child! can't people see the damage that film is doing?!
he was killed doing something he saw in the movie. it was terrance and phillip... they killed kenny.
you bastards.
this is it! the time for action is now!!  <b>something must be done! this is like a spreading rash! they're pulling out our children's brains and filling them with trash! can't you see what this is leading to? a world of smut and sex and poo! i believe the good fight has begun! something must be done!</b>
i bet him he couldn't do it... i bet him a hundred dollars!
come on, cartman. it's not your fault.
no, i know. i'm just fucking stoked i don't have to pay him!
oh.
i can't believe he's dead.
yeah, i'm having total deja vu right now. like this has all happened before...
how can they do this?
it isn't fair!
hello, conan!
hello, brooke shields!
good one, phillip!  cheers.
cheers, terrance!
terrance and phillip, you are under arrest for working in america without the proper documents! we got you!
dude, what the hell is going on?
phillip, we've been tricked and ambushed by the conan o'brian show!!
this little scrotum sucker willfully deceived us!  you are a bad man!
and you call yourself a canadian!  i told you we should of done leno!
dude, our moms arrested terrance and phillip!
our moms suck!
who the hell made up that law?!
you can't do this!! have you ever had cheesy poofs? they're a taste sensation with a delightful cheddar crunch.
come on, you guys... we have to think!
about what?
about cheesy poofs, dumbass! this whole thing has gone too far!
boys, we have to have a difficult discussion.
we already know what you did. we saw it on television.
but they fucking didn't do anything wrong!
yeah!  and what rim job expert went and outlawed cheesy poofs!?
what was that word, young man!?
oh, he said rim job.  it's when someone licks your ass for-
i know what it is!
what's that?
you boys need help.  there are rehab centers that specialize in treating people with chronic addictions to bad language.
eric!  don't talk to ms. brovlofski that way!
but mom!  i'm not fucking addicted to fucking bad language!  i don't have a fucking problem!
mmmmmphphphphp!!!!!
fallen one... we have such sights to show you!
i am satan. i am your god, now.
mph rm!!!
oh, a new recruit, huh? welcome to hell, kid! relax! take a load off!!
you remember... saddam hussein, don't you?!
ugh... you guys, seriously... i'm having cheesy poof withdrawal...
mkay, kids from all over the state have been brought here, because you all share the same problem. uh, young man... let's start with you.
you've got a stupid accent too.
eric, that is not appropriate.
what? fuck french people. fuck 'em in the ear.
mkay, you see, children. this is exactly what i'm talking about. we have to change the way you think.
uh, we're just, starting our program...
this is not a place for fun and games! this is rehabilitation! now get to it!! we at mac have a trial to go to!
mkay.
god damn it your mom is a bitch, kyle.
fight the power!
the young boy that died lit himself on fire. it was unfortunate, but how can they blame us?
don't believe the hype!!
the problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. you try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
yeah, god, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
oh, you are such a maroon!
you would know, dummy.
what the hell was that?!
dude, they cut out 92 minutes!
so you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. and of course, the mpaa didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. what did you think?
oh man, i'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
eric, you're not watching your mouth!
you get me cheesy poofs with the delightful cheddar crunch, and i'll watch my fucking mouth!
eric!!!!  you need to be rehabilitated. help me to help you!
help yourself prickfuck!
i am not a prickfuck, mkay? you little asshole!
how is the children's progress?
very encouraging. most of the children have been weened from their naughty mouths.
what do you mean most, why not all?
well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
then we'll have to resort to plan b and call the v-chip organization.
mrs. brovlofski, the v-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
i don't care if it's dangerous! desperate times call for desperate measures, mr. mackey. perhaps i need to remind you of your situation.
alright, i'll make the call...
dude, let's help terrance and phillip!!
how do we do that?
yeah!
this is about freedom of speech, stan, about censorship.
what the hell are you talking about, kid?
you don't get it stan... you just don't get it.
what? what don't i get?  what don't i get?
i don't know, dude.
that british dickhole is what's taking wendy away from me!
i thought she wasn't your girlfriend, dude.
she's not! but if she was it would be that little asshole who's fucking it up for me!
thank god, that sucked ass.
uh, except for you eric. i'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the f word and the n word.
the n word?
norwegian ass raper.
oh yeah.
the rest of you are graduated. you can go home today.
wendy, mkay, if you want to start getting political, i'll throw your skinny little butt right back into rehab. mkay?
how the fuck can you not graduate me?! does that mean i have to stay here?!
no, eric... i'm afraid it's phase two for you...
hey, relax satan. don't get all worked up. you're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.
mrph mprph!!
what? what do you mean you don't belong here? relax guy, hell is for children.
mrph mprhm mm rmph!
a deal? you wanna make a deal with the devil. well sure, deals are mounds o' fun.
saddam, would you let me do my job please!
hey relax, guy. let's see what the kid wants.
mph rmph rm rmph rmph rm!
oh, you want out of hell, huh?
well of course he wants out of hell! the whole point of hell is that you don't want to be here!
okay, kid, i have a deal for you! if you want out of hell, all you have to do is collect 10 proofs of purchases from 'snacky smores.'  they're rich, chocolatey and really hit the spot. bring me ten proofs of purchases and we'll grant you any wish you want.
mrph?
i wouldn't bullshit you kid! snacky smores are now available in stores everywhere! no biggie!
i don't see why you have to belittle me in front of people like that.
hey, relax guy. it's just a cruel joke. rich, chocolatey snacky smores are only available up on earth. he'll never get 'em, see?
sometimes i just think you don't have any respect for me.
hey, come here, guy.
who's my cream puff?
i am.
patient 453 here has been fitted with the new v-chip...
my head hurts.
don't worry about that. now, i want you to say 'doggy.'
doggy.
notice that nothing happens.  now say 'montana.'
montana.
good. now 'pillow'.
pillow.
alright, now i want you to say 'horsefucker.'
ow!! that hurt god dammi-
ow!! you can't do this to me!! this isn't fair!!! you sons a bitche--
success!! our device works perfectly! we will begin mass production immediately!
hi wendy.
hi stan.
wow, dude. wendy could really give a rats ass about you.
i bet she would if my name was gregory!!
good thing she was never your girlfriend... dude, here comes cartman.
hey, cartman, did they put that v-chip in your head or your ass?
what's the difference?
whoa!  what the hell was that?!
dude!  it's the v-chip!  it shocks him ever time he cusses!
hey cartman.
what?
you know, me and stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
oh yeah?!  well you're a monkey-shit-
this is sweet!!
totally!
nazis!!
what's the matter, wendy?
nothing, stan. you wouldn't understand.
god damn it, why does she keep saying that?
i'm so sick of these soldiers.
yeah, they suck.
hello there, children!!
hey, chef.
how would like some salisbury steak with buttered noodles?
we can't, we're on a hunger strike.
a hunger strike? for what?
to free terrance and phillip.
but you guys... it's salisbury steak.
chef, do you know anything about women?
ha! is the pope catholic?
i don't know.
children, i know all there is to know about women.
what's the secret to making a woman happy?
oh that's easy, you just gotta find the clitoris.
huh?
oops, i guess you haven't got that far in your anatomy class, huh?
no, what does that mean, find the clitoris?
what's going on, chef?
something big, children.
chef, what does it mean that we're at war?
it's... it's not good children.
my fellow americans. i have led this fight in the war against profanity. i have founded mothers against canada.  our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
as commander in chief, i have ordered our army to set up defensive positions along the us-canada border in anticipation of an attack.
what about air strikes?
huh?
we have to have air strikes on their military and entertainment centers.  it's the only way to ensure that their smut can't reach american soil!
oh, uh...  i don't know if air strikes are necessary.
not necessary?!  mr. president, may i remind you that our country's heart and soul are at stake, and our children's minds are the battlefield! the bastard canadians want to fight us because we won't tolerate their potty mouths. well, if it is war they want... then war they shall have!!!
you just get cranky when you're tired, that's all.  i told you that you shouldn't have tried to carry that futon all by yourself.
i'm not cranky.  and that futon was not too big to carry myself-
it has come to be...  the four horsemen are drawing nigh!  the time of the prophecy is upon us!
oh i love when you get all biblical satan.  you know exactly how to turn my crank!
no i'm being serious! those canadian entertainers are to be killed. it is the seventh sign.
yeah!  yeah!!!  man i'm getting so hot!!!
do you always think about sex?  i'm talking about some very important stuff here!
listen buttercup, let's make love and forget about the whole thing.
is sex the only thing that matters to you?
you know i do.
i know.
so what do you say we shut off that light and get close, huh?
does it say what the clitoris is?
all it says is that it's above the vulva... but where the hell is the vulva?
isn't that in arizona or something?
what is this?
they're burning all the canadian stuff cause of the war.
that book wasn't canadian!
this is all cause of your mom, kyle. she's such a bitch-  agh!! i mean - she's such a... meanie.
and she's getting worse...
it's only a matter of time before my mom has him burned too!
what has the world come to? this is horrible. we're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
-no cheesy poofs.
-no cheesy poofs... what the hell is happening?
i don't know. but it has gone far enough! i'm sick of it!  <b>something must be done! change has got to come around! they're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! can't you see what this is leading to? a world of chains and ties and glue! we have to fight before they've taken every one! something must be done!</b>
i agree! the only way to save our future is to unite and fight!  <b>something must be done! we must take action fast! my parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!</b>
<b>and my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me i agree that there is now a battle to be won! something must be done!</b>
but what are we going to do against this entire army?
okay... i just need to find a few private message boards...
wait! before we put a message out, do a search on the word 'clitoris'.
okay...
"found eight million pages with the word clitoris"!
wow!
i'll just try the first one.
is it cartman's mom?
very funny!
oh, son of a bitch!  aaghgh!! i mean, son of a biscuit!
maybe that's who your father is, cartman!
ber dada!
get out of here ike, you're too young for this stuff!
papa mama simi.
come on, just get to the message board!
i'm trying, i can't find a canadian server... i've got to break into the main frame...
dude, do you know what you're doing?
no, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
bingo. okay, here we go...  want to help terrance and phillip? meet us for a meeting at gladdy's barn tomorrow night...
tell 'em we'll have pie and punch.
we're not gonna have pie and punch!
more people will come if they think there'll be pie and punch!
pie and punch... this is top secret. the password is...
you stay up here in the attic, ike. don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
uhh...
goodnight, ike, we're all going to bed.
ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... it's probably canadian spies!!
