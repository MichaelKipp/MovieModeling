hey, mis whittington, what is up?
my blood pleasure.  you scared the hell out of me.
oh.  sorry.  I am on my way to the ring and --
i think someone broke into my house.
no shit?!
no shit.
jimmy, what are you doing?
checking out your place.
no.  wait for the police.
and miss the big game?  no way.
nothing to fear.  the coast is clear.
you sure?
totally.  i checked all the rooms and closets...
nothing's missing?
do not think so.  but they sure did a real number on your office. crap everywhere.
my office?
yeah.  oh, and they messed up your kitchen pretty good, too... goodnight.
nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
you are so predictable.
what the --
betcha' did not predict that.
I am sixteen, keri.  i should be able to live wherever i want.
and i should have a son who calls me "mom".  looks like we are both shit out of luck.
okay, you win.  I will call you mom. now can i move into the dorms?
no.
well, dad thinks it is okay.
you are father thinks it is okay to run off to cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  somehow his opinion does not count.
i promise not to run off to cancun.
forget it.
the dorms are only fifty feet away.  you could practically see into my window.  so, what difference does it make?
my point exactly.  see, we both agree.
alright, i was wrong.  there is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
i took the padlock off your door. what more do you want?
my life is a living hell.
where are you going?
to the bathroom.  can i do that alone or do you want to watch?
i thought you would never ask.
you are twisted.
i know.
no thanks, I am not thirsty.
it is for your cigarette.  i prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
why am i here?
they said on the phone you were assigned to the meyers case.
with all due respect, detective, you can not go blaming every brutal murder in illinois on michael meyers.
pamela whittington was a long time associate of dr. loomis.  her home office was ransacked.  it was chock full of loomis' files on meyers.  it would say that makes meyers a suspect, would not you?
well, when you put it that way.
right.  so why do not we get on with this investigation?
i like a woman who takes control.
one set of muddy shoe prints.
that do not match either of the victim's.
where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but does not connect.
no blood on the knife.
the killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
as which point she drops to her knees in pain...
explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
impressive, blake.  where did you learn how to do that?
girl scouts.
you aced it, did not you?
i did alright.
fuckin' a.
he gave me a fuckin' a?  wow.
what is this?
you say, "the key to my heart," and I am going to hurl.
shelve the barf bag.  it is the key to the main gate.
where did you get it?
swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
you stole it?
i borrowed it.
not me.
why not?
i can not afford to get caught.
are not they doing a terrific job this year?
looks great.  it does.
you okay?  you seem a little off.
nothing a good stiff drink can not fix.
it is john, is not it?
it is always john.
still wants to move out?
he is been living out of moving boxes for three months.
this kid just wants his freedom.
it is not going to happen.
the tighter you squeeze, the harder he will try to break free.
oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
does not make it bad advice.
I am going into town... run a few errands before dark.  need anything?
a box of fortune cookies... I am running out of advice.
bye will.
carter.
it is blake.  meet me at grand view.
where?
the cemetery...
yeah, alright... I will be there in ten.
besides, it is historically inaccurate.
what the fuck are you talking about?
michael meyers never used a meat cleaver.  it was a butcher knife.
who are you, the serial killer police?  what difference does it make?
it is not historically accurate, that is all.
another historical inaccuracy.
would somebody shut this guy up?
you take all your dates here. blake?
only the real stiffs.
i can be real stiff.
charming.
that is it?
care to join me?
come on, carter.  you know it is michael.
what do you want me to do, put out an a.p.b. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
yes.
sweet dreams, blake.
shit, john!  what the hell were you doing out there?!
nothing.
you are kidding with that answer, right?
i just went for a walk.  it is no big deal.
wrong.  there are rules in this house and you are going to follow them whether you like it or not.
or what?  you are going to shoot me?
it is an option.
well, maybe if you would let me live in the dorms, i would not have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
oh, so now it is my fault?
just forget it...
hey, you alright?
what?
what are you looking at?
I am fine.  i just need to lie down...
carter.
it is blake.  how do you feel about wisconsin?
look, they are staring right at us.
you think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
nah, i did not tell her where i went.
is that all you guys can think about?  amy never came back last night.  maybe she is in trouble.
better her than me.
you are unbelievable.
bruce... what is going on?  the kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
better take 'em to virgil's downtown.  we got a dead body in there.
a dead body?
it is amy kramer.
my god...
pretty messy.  parents have already been notified.  our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
do you know who did this?
well, eddie catero did not show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. car's still missing.
think eddie had something to do with it?
does not look good.
what are you doing here?!
i came to see you.
i can see that.  why?
can i come in?
are you crazy?  you will get caught.
then you come out here.
then I will get caught.
well, I am not going until i talk to you.
alright.  I will come out.  just be quiet.
you really think eddie killed her?
you saw that michael meyers display.  you have got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
i guess.  it is just hard to believe.
you look kind of cold.
I am okay.
here, take my jacket.
better?
yeah.
molly, of all the people... if i can not trust my resident assistant, then what?
i know.  I am really, really sorry, miss tate.  please let me keep the job... it is the only way i can afford to stay here.
okay, tell you what... you can still be the school r.a., but no dance tomorrow night.
okay... thank you.
ooooh, busted.
big time.  and news travels fast. would not be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
I will be damned.
do i know you?
we are sorry to startle you, miss tate.
the door was open, so we let ourselves in.
detective carter from the haddonfield p.d.
toni blake from langley p.d.
mind if we sit down?
I would prefer you didn't.  I am very busy.
okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
detective...
carter.
... i think it would be best if you both left.
might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, miss tate.
i never stop thinking about it, detective.  the only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
funny, we just drove right in.
well, i can assure you, it will not happen again.  thanks for your concern.  goodbye.
shane's going as a condom.
i thought you were allergic to latex.
I will pop a benadryl.
you think they will let him in dressed like that?
oh, they are so stupid... I will just tell them he is going as a sausage casing.
linda!  he killed linda!
who?!
michael meyers!
I am sorry, alright?  it was just a stupid joke.
will, sit down...
there is something i have to tell you both.  it is going to sound strange...
what?
my name has not always been keri tate.  it was once laurie strode.
you are right.  it does sound strange.
you some kind of fugitive or something?
i was trying to get away from someone.
who?
michael meyers.
the serial killer?
he is my brother.
now you are joking, right?
afraid not.  you can pick your friends, but you can not pick your family.
no, will, this is not the alcohol talking.  it is the truth.
i can not believe this is happening.
shit happens.
wait a minute... slow down... you are telling me michael meyers is my uncle?
yes.
any other psychotic relatives i should know about?  jason?  freddy krueger?
no.
why did not you tell me?
i was trying to protect you from this...
where are you going?
i do not know.
you just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it.
are you going to leave, too?
never.
so you are really michael meyers' sister?
yeah.
do we have to invite him to the wedding?
blaaaaaggghhhhh!
shit, linda!
you are so easy...
was not scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
nope.  hey, you think I will win scariest costume?
linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
thanks!
where is shane?
condom boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
but the dance is in the gymnasium.
very insightful.
let the party begin.
have enough fun for the both of us.
oh, do not be such a victim.
wait.
what is it?
i have to pee.
can not you hold it?
can not you?
not a real fan of halloween humor, will.
oh, right.  sorry.
I am going to head back to the office... finish up some things.
can not it wait till monday?  i thought maybe we could dance...  I am very light of my feet.
he found you, did not he?
get on the bus.
where is molly?  she is not in her room...
just get on the bus.
I am not leaving without her.
john, you can not help her now.
what?  where is she?
john...
oh, god... no... not molly.
please, get on the bus...
keri, you all right?
we have got to get these kids out of here...
I will make sure there is no kids left in the dorms...
yeah, me too, keri.
call me laurie, will ya?
keri.... laurie... how about if i just call you mom?
that would work.
