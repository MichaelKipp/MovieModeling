hey, mis whittington, what's up?
my blood pleasure.  you scared the hell out of me.
oh.  sorry.  i'm on my way to the ring and --
i think someone broke into my house.
no shit?!
no shit.
jimmy, what are you doing?
checking out your place.
no.  wait for the police.
and miss the big game?  no way.
nothing to fear.  the coast is clear.
you sure?
totally.  i checked all the rooms and closets...
nothing's missing?
don't think so.  but they sure did a real number on your office. crap everywhere.
my office?
yeah.  oh, and they messed up your kitchen pretty good, too... goodnight.
nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
you're so predictable.
what the --
betcha' didn't predict that.
i'm sixteen, keri.  i should be able to live wherever i want.
and i should have a son who calls me "mom".  looks like we're both shit out of luck.
okay, you win.  i'll call you mom. now can i move into the dorms?
no.
well, dad thinks it's okay.
you're father thinks it's okay to run off to cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top.  somehow his opinion doesn't count.
i promise not to run off to cancun.
forget it.
the dorms are only fifty feet away.  you could practically see into my window.  so, what difference does it make?
my point exactly.  see, we both agree.
alright, i was wrong.  there is a big difference between rooming with your buddies and living with your mother and school headmaster.
i took the padlock off your door. what more do you want?
my life is a living hell.
where are you going?
to the bathroom.  can i do that alone or do you want to watch?
i thought you'd never ask.
you're twisted.
i know.
no thanks, i'm not thirsty.
it's for your cigarette.  i prefer not to contaminate my crime scene with micropollutants.
why am i here?
they said on the phone you were assigned to the meyers case.
with all due respect, detective, you can't go blaming every brutal murder in illinois on michael meyers.
pamela whittington was a long time associate of dr. loomis.  her home office was ransacked.  it was chock full of loomis' files on meyers.  it'd say that makes meyers a suspect, wouldn't you?
well, when you put it that way.
right.  so why don't we get on with this investigation?
i like a woman who takes control.
one set of muddy shoe prints.
that don't match either of the victim's.
where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
no blood on the knife.
the killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
as which point she drops to her knees in pain...
explaining the low height of the blood splatter on the curtains...
impressive, blake.  where'd you learn how to do that?
girl scouts.
you aced it, didn't you?
i did alright.
fuckin' a.
he gave me a fuckin' a?  wow.
what's this?
you say, "the key to my heart," and i'm gonna hurl.
shelve the barf bag.  it's the key to the main gate.
where'd you get it?
swiped it from my mom's desk yesterday.
you stole it?
i borrowed it.
not me.
why not?
i can't afford to get caught.
aren't they doing a terrific job this year?
looks great.  it does.
you okay?  you seem a little off.
nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
it's john, isn't it?
it's always john.
still wants to move out?
he's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
this kid just wants his freedom.
it's not going to happen.
the tighter you squeeze, the harder he'll try to break free.
oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
doesn't make it bad advice.
i'm going into town... run a few errands before dark.  need anything?
a box of fortune cookies... i'm running out of advice.
bye will.
carter.
it's blake.  meet me at grand view.
where?
the cemetery...
yeah, alright... i'll be there in ten.
besides, it's historically inaccurate.
what the fuck are you talking about?
michael meyers never used a meat cleaver.  it was a butcher knife.
who are you, the serial killer police?  what difference does it make?
it's not historically accurate, that's all.
another historical inaccuracy.
would somebody shut this guy up?
you take all your dates here. blake?
only the real stiffs.
i can be real stiff.
charming.
that's it?
care to join me?
come on, carter.  you know it's michael.
what do you want me to do, put out an a.p.b. on a man in overalls wearing a white mask dragging a headstone?
yes.
sweet dreams, blake.
shit, john!  what the hell were you doing out there?!
nothing.
you're kidding with that answer, right?
i just went for a walk.  it's no big deal.
wrong.  there are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
or what?  you're gonna shoot me?
it's an option.
well, maybe if you'd let me live in the dorms, i wouldn't have to sneak out to spend time with my friends.
oh, so now it's my fault?
just forget it...
hey, you alright?
what?
what are you looking at?
i'm fine.  i just need to lie down...
carter.
it's blake.  how do you feel about wisconsin?
look, they're staring right at us.
you think your mom knows we snuck out last night?
nah, i didn't tell her where i went.
is that all you guys can think about?  amy never came back last night.  maybe she's in trouble.
better her than me.
you're unbelievable.
bruce... what's going on?  the kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
better take 'em to virgil's downtown.  we got a dead body in there.
a dead body?
it's amy kramer.
my god...
pretty messy.  parents have already been notified.  our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
do you know who did this?
well, eddie catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. car's still missing.
think eddie had something to do with it?
doesn't look good.
what are you doing here?!
i came to see you.
i can see that.  why?
can i come in?
are you crazy?  you'll get caught.
then you come out here.
then i'll get caught.
well, i'm not going until i talk to you.
alright.  i'll come out.  just be quiet.
you really think eddie killed her?
you saw that michael meyers display.  you've got to be pretty twisted to come up with something like that.
i guess.  it's just hard to believe.
you look kind of cold.
i'm okay.
here, take my jacket.
better?
yeah.
molly, of all the people... if i can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
i know.  i'm really, really sorry, miss tate.  please let me keep the job... it's the only way i can afford to stay here.
okay, tell you what... you can still be the school r.a., but no dance tomorrow night.
okay... thank you.
ooooh, busted.
big time.  and news travels fast. wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
i'll be damned.
do i know you?
we're sorry to startle you, miss tate.
the door was open, so we let ourselves in.
detective carter from the haddonfield p.d.
toni blake from langley p.d.
mind if we sit down?
i'd prefer you didn't.  i'm very busy.
okay, then how 'bout we ask you a few questions?
detective...
carter.
... i think it would be best if you both left.
might want to stop and think about the safety of your students, miss tate.
i never stop thinking about it, detective.  the only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
funny, we just drove right in.
well, i can assure you, it won't happen again.  thanks for your concern.  goodbye.
shane's going as a condom.
i thought you were allergic to latex.
i'll pop a benadryl.
you think they'll let him in dressed like that?
oh, they're so stupid... i'll just tell them he's going as a sausage casing.
linda!  he killed linda!
who?!
michael meyers!
i'm sorry, alright?  it was just a stupid joke.
will, sit down...
there's something i have to tell you both.  it's going to sound strange...
what?
my name hasn't always been keri tate.  it was once laurie strode.
you're right.  it does sound strange.
you some kind of fugitive or something?
i was trying to get away from someone.
who?
michael meyers.
the serial killer?
he's my brother.
now you're joking, right?
afraid not.  you can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
no, will, this isn't the alcohol talking.  it's the truth.
i can't believe this is happening.
shit happens.
wait a minute... slow down... you're telling me michael meyers is my uncle?
yes.
any other psychotic relatives i should know about?  jason?  freddy krueger?
no.
why didn't you tell me?
i was trying to protect you from this...
where are you going?
i don't know.
you just dropped a shitload on him... give him some time to digest it.
are you going to leave, too?
never.
so you're really michael meyers' sister?
yeah.
do we have to invite him to the wedding?
blaaaaaggghhhhh!
shit, linda!
you're so easy...
wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
nope.  hey, you think i'll win scariest costume?
linda, you are without a doubt the scariest person on campus.
thanks!
where's shane?
condom boy is waiting for me in the cafeteria.
but the dance is in the gymnasium.
very insightful.
let the party begin.
have enough fun for the both of us.
oh, don't be such a victim.
wait.
what is it?
i have to pee.
can't you hold it?
can't you?
not a real fan of halloween humor, will.
oh, right.  sorry.
i'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
can't it wait till monday?  i thought maybe we could dance...  i'm very light of my feet.
he found you, didn't he?
get on the bus.
where's molly?  she's not in her room...
just get on the bus.
i'm not leaving without her.
john, you can't help her now.
what?  where is she?
john...
oh, god... no... not molly.
please, get on the bus...
keri, you all right?
we've got to get these kids out of here...
i'll make sure there's no kids left in the dorms...
yeah, me too, keri.
call me laurie, will ya?
keri.... laurie... how about if i just call you mom?
that would work.
