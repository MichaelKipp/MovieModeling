you. tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?
the difference lies in the field of civic virtue. a citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. the civilian does not.
the exact words of the text. but do you understand it ? do you believe it ?
uh, i do not know.
of course you don't. i doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.
good for you.
your turn...
you still have not kissed her yet ? do not lie.
what is the hurry ?
others are waiting.
did you read her mind ?
do not have to... some mating semaphore is pretty hard to miss.
yeah, but i want carmen.
you got it bad.
she is flying starships !
who ?
marco's sister. can you imagine maneuvering half a million tons through crwoded space lanes... you got to have nerves of steel ! reflexes are critical
i have good reflexes.
eeuch !
aw, c'mon, it is just a bug.
well, if that is the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
excuse me...!
35% on the math final !  no one could be that dumb with numbers.
well, at least you did not lose your lunch over a bug. how embarassing.
who cares about bugs ? you can not go anywhere if you do not know math.
do not be so sure. i like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
then how come you will not hold hands with me at school ?
i do not want everyone to see.
why will not you kiss me when we are all alone ?
how come that is all you talk about anymore ?
it is all i think about anymore.
you can not walk me home.
why not ?
i thought you were going to help carl.
carl can wait.
johnny, my dad's home today.
what is he got against me... i mean, i 'm a teenager. you can not be a citizen when you are only a teenager !
it is not you, johnny. your parents are rich they do not need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. he is a veteran.
well, if your dad does not like me, how come we are such good friends ?
sometimes i do what i want, eh ?
do not think about it... go on instinct.
ace of spades.
statistically speaking you should have accidentally guessed right by know.
in addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I am unlucky ? two of hearts.
how do you make him do that ?
i gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. he is going to go eat it.
ten of clubs. you still gonna sign up for starside r&d ?
passport to the universe. who would not want that ?
I have been thinking about applying for federal service, too. fleet, maybe.
your father will never let you.
I am eighteen. it is my decision, i think I would make a pretty good pilot. I have good great reflexes. you need that for maneuvering, you know.
only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. so what do you think your chances are ?
eight point... no, uh, seven...
if you can not do those numbers, you have not got a chance.
all i know is carmen's going to be a citizen, and i do not think it will work out for us if I am not.
love... how excruciatingly pathetic. now try and pay attention.
a lot can happen in three minutes.
hut... hut !
are you alright ?
I am getting better.
so what are you doing later ?
everyone is going to the dance. are not you ?
i do not know. it is my last night as acivilian. i ship out for tereshkova tomorrow.
I am all ears.
do not you have to finish the game ?
do not get any ideas. she is my girl.
you can never be sure.
what ?
you were drifting. flip six, three hole. on one, got it ?
just throw me the ball, diz.
who said you could grow up so fast ? last time i checked you were only five years old. you had such a bright little face...
aw, do not get mushy.
this came for you today. i presume on your request.
a lot of my friends are doing federal service...
have you lost you lost your mind ? I would rather take ten lashes in public square than see you ruin your life.
it is aterm of service, not a career. i just want to get out on my own and see the galaxy for a couple of years.
johnny, people get hurt... people get killed in the federal service. if something happened to you i do not know what i would do...
who gave you this idea ? it is that teacher. what is his name ? you know the one i mean.
mr. rasczak.
rasczak... silly name. there ought to be a law against using a school as a recruiting station !
no, mr. rasczak does not do that at all. he sorta discourages you really.
good, because you are going to harvard, and that is the end of it.
I am eighteen. it is my decision.
oh, is that how it is ?
wait you two. dad and i have a surprise for you that will settle this. can you guess what it is ?
uh, no.
a trip to the outer rings. whad'ya think of that ?
wow ! santori and zegema beach, I have always wanted to go there.
good good, then it is all settled.
a year at harvard and you will  see this "federal service" is just menial training for inferior people so they can call themselves "citizens" and take airs for the rest of their lives.
wait a minute ! carl is doing his federal and he is not inferior. he is the smartest kid at school !
sorry. carl's a fine boy...
i do not know what they teach at harvard, but i think I am pretty good enough the way i am !
johnny, please. calm yourself.
well, that is what you are saying ! you are saying that I am not good enough the way i am now !
why did you go and do that ? he was all ready to go zegema beach !
teenagers !
hey, rico, wanna dance ?
actually, diz, i promised carmen...
too bad for her if she is not around.
you still gonna play for brazil ?
looks like, unless tokyo lets me start.
well, anyone who gets you is lucky.
how come we never got together ?
can not we just be friends, diz ?
sure.
uh, look, diz...
guess you gotta go.
you are the best.
is not it great to be in love ?
how do i know if this is love ?
it would not be so romantic if we weren't...
romance is just a vestigial biological response to procreation...
aw, you are in love with me... you just dont know it yet.
wait, i want to talk to mr. rasczak.
I will meet you outside.
mister rasczak ?
what is it, rico ?
i just wanted to say thanks 'cause history and moral philosophy was the best class i had this year.
well, it is not really my job to please. hope you learned something.
i wanna join up, mr. rasczak. i think i have what it take to be a citizen.
good for you. go find out.
well, my parents are against it, and i know it is my choice, but i was wondering... what would you do if you were me ?
figuring things out for yourself is the only freedom anyone really has. use that freedom. make your own choice, rico.
johnny, this is zander.
yeah, we know each other from the game. no hard feeling, eh, chum ?
none at all... we won.
good luck at the academy.
he just got accepted to the fleet academy. is not that great ?
yeah, sure, i guess.
no, i mean if he can get in, maybe i have a chance.
what are you talking about ? we both know you are going to be a pilot.
zander is going for pilot, too.
you two have so much in common.
johnny rico, you are jealous !
i can not help it.
he is nothing like you.
i do not even know if you are my girl.
are you the boy for me ?
I am going to do it, carmen. I am going to sign up for federal service.
everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
who cares ?
you are right. let's never stop...
i love you, carmen.
shhh...
no talking please. I am going to ask you some questions. please answer all questions truthfully. we will know if you don't. birthplace ?
here in buenos aires.
are your parents currently citizens ?
no, sir.
which do you think is more important, courage or confidence ?
courage, i guess.
please complete this sentence. i want to be citizen because...
i want to be a citizen because... well, because of my girl, sir.
i wonder where carl is. you do not suppose...?
naw, i made it, carl made it.
he was in the group with me. i guess he didn't...
shhh ! do not make him feel worse.
hey, carl, what is wrong ?
did you get starside r&d ?
i do not believe it !
i got games & theory.
games & theory ? that is military intelligence... oh, carl !
whoa ! way to go, boy-yo !
let's all make a vow. let's swear we will always be friends no matter what.
I will go for that.
you will resign, and that is all there is to it. it might look bad, but if that is the worst you suffer...
i will not quit !
I am telling you, you will ! you are not going back. you are going to go on vacation !
I am not going on vacation ! i want to be acitizen ! it is my decision. i made it.
...cut off !
johnny, why will not you change your mind ? does citizenship mean so much to you ?
well, yeah, sure...
i hope so. i hope you do not ruin your life over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.
you are late.
my dad had to help me pack. suddenly he is afraid he is never going to see me again or something. it was sweet, but it took forever. anyway, i guess I am ready to go.
poor boy. I am sorry your parents were so mad.
who cares ! the federation'll give me everything i need for the next two years, right ?
you talk to carl ?
he left this morning. he could not say where.
I am going to miss you.
I will miss you, too, johnny.
i love you.
com'on, just say it. try it on for size.
alright, i love you.
do you mean it ?
i said it. is not that enough ? do not forget to write !
you got some guts for a rich kid. i guess you and me could be buddies.
what an honor...
hey, do not laugh. everyone oughta have a friend like me !
hey, amigo, come chow with me.
no thanks, diz.
what is your malfunction, rico ?
you are. i joined up to get out on my own. and you had to tag along.
what ? you think i joined the mobile infantery because of you ?
you saying you did not ?
what makes you think... you will make... squad leader, rico ?
something... I have got...you don't.
you rich kids... are all the same !
it is not about rich... it is about who is best...!
wanting it does not make you the best one for the job.
oh, yeah ? i do not see anyone else here with the chops to lead.
well, maybe you better look again.
our love will grow, dear, year by year...
bye ! write me ! I am going to kill you guys !
pilot trainee ibanez reporting for duty, ma'am.
take the number one chair, ibanez. follow all instructions of you supervisor.
yes, ma'am !
hey ! what are you doing here ?
I am the guy who is going to teach you to fly this crate.
assistant insructor... you must be some kind of a hot stick. should i call you "sir" ?
only when i give you an order.
it is amazing, us running into each other like this. maybe it is fate.
maybe not. i heard about this crazy girl coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but a natural. when it turned out it was you, i made sure we would run into each other...
alright, take her out, ibanez.
yes, ma'am.
in simulation, my supervisors could never keep up.
this is not simulation anymore. take'er out easy, cadet.
oh, yes, sir. vector ?
twenty-five by five, roll seven. and do not exceed port speed.
or...?
they revoke our flight status.
oh, i see... teamwork.
steady as she goes, number one. prepare for warp. number two, design for jupiter orbit.
yes, ma'am. star drive in three... two... one...
man, they are defended... no way in.
flip six, three hole.
what ?
high school... remember ? run a flip six, three hole play, and you might score...
cover me.
you got it.
smith, go ! mcintire, go ! flores, go ! rico, I am making you sqaud leader !
sir, thank you, sir !
do not stand there dumb... go !
shhhh...!
I am glad you are doing so well. if they have not made you squad leader by now, I am sure you will.
funny how they always want to be your friends after they kick your guts out.
it is what i deserve.
whad'ya talkin  about ?
i joined up for her. i would not even be here if it was not for her. I am a fool.
you made squad leader on your own, and, hey, you still got me to kick around.
the marauder power suit will prevent serious injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team score will suffer accordingly. rico, has each member of your squad completed a weapons safety check ?
sir, yes, sir !
rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
sir, yes, sir. breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and i asked him to show it to me, sir.
are you rated to repair a marauder power suit, rico ?
sir, no, sir.
then why did you order your man to remove his helmet during a live fire exercise ?
sir, i needed everyone in my squad operational, sir... i... i wanted to win, sir.
do you freely admit to the charges made against you ?
sir... i guess i do, sir.
thanks. you read my mind. third watch always seems to last forever.
oh, i do not know... depends on who you are spending it with.
profile's wrong... there.
no, i replotted the course. it is more efficient this way.
three weeks aboard a starship and you know it all, huh ?
hey, check it.
you know i was talking to captain, deladier, and she said...
do not change the subject. am i right ?
well, whad'ya know...
do not mess with the boss. so what did the captain say ?
she got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. she thinks we are good together.
you and me, huh ?
i want to be part of the best flight team in the fleet...
me, too... day and night-cycle.
report.
captain, we are in the path of an unidentified object moving at near light speed...
where is it ?
there !	gravity field... it is big !
it looks like an... asteroid.
where did it come from ?
trajectory indicates it came out of the arachnid quarantine zone.
number 4, contact fleet and tell 'em there is a loose asteroid headed their way.
good work, number 1. you will do.
thank you, ma'am.
it stinks, you goin.
i do not stay where I am not wanted.
if they did not want you, they woulda kicked you out, amigo.
hey, they humiliated me in front of everyone ! I am just supposed to take it, huh ? well, I am not gonna, and i guess that proves i just can not cut it.
hello... oh, johnny...!
hi, mom.
bill... pick up... it is johnny ! you little rat. you have not called, you have not written. it is been so lonely here without you...
well, it is just good to hear from you. what is up, son ?
it is not really working out for me here, dad. i was thinking... i was hoping it would be alright if i came home.
well, of course you should come home immedietly !
I have made a mess of things. I have been so stupid...
do not talk like that. get yourself home as fast as you can.
we will all have dinner. I will fix your favorite.
yeah ! we will talk it out and have a good glass of wine ... and... well, we love you, son.
oh, my, what is that ?
looks like rain.
this time of the year...?
well, see ya.
you take the stroll down washout lane, you are only proving one thing, johnny.
what is that, diz ?
that you do not have what it takes to be acitizen !
sir, i wish to reconsider my request to drop out, sir.
sorry, son. i can not do it. you signed the 1240/a. it would be illegal.
sir, i know it was wrong. i did not learn from one mistake and i made another, sir.  sir, my family... my whole family was in buenos aires, sir.
is that your signature, rico ?
sir, yes it is, sir.
does not look like it to me.
i say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut together.
what do i want with a scar ?
what happened to your hair ?
what do you think ? everyone did it when we got our wings. you do not like it, do you ?
it is alright, i guess. you hear from anyone made it out of b.a. alive ?
it is funny. sometimes i forget. then it hits me, and i can not stop crying.
i try just to be happy I am still alive.
you do not look very happy to see me.
should i be ?
johnny... life is so different from the way it was. one day you will see what i did was best for both of us.
everything coposetic, lieutenant ?
zander, you remember johnny ? zander and i are a flight team now.
best in the fleet !
i get it. this is the part that is best for both of us. do not do me anymore favors, eh ?
johnny, wait...
forget it, carmen. the mobile infantery does a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered, thoughtless and rude.
you got something to say about the mobile infantery ?
you heard me. wanna make something out of it, private ?
not with an officer, no, sir. the m.i. does not mint stupid cap troopers.
let's disregaed rank... everybody hear that ? rank is not an issue here.
zander, please... let's go !
what is wrong with you ?
hey, it is just a vestigal response to procreation... bitch.
no, this hurts.
yaaaaaaaa !
mobile infantery rules !
death to all bugs !
plasma, ma'am... from the planet.
bug batteries... according to military intelligence, it will be random and light. drop status ?
this is not random or light. someone made amistake...!
that is it, we are empty ma'am !
lieutenant's bought the farm. where is the sarge...?
i did not see him !
i was thinking. maybe we should get married, carmen.
you were not thinking...you were dreaming !
if we are going to be a team, why not be a real team ?
there is a war on. i want a command, i want my own ship, you do, too...
so ?
so who is got time to get married ?
fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. you would probably get a promotion out of it.
funny...
I am not kidding. marriage is -
no, funny there is almost no wounded at all.
hey, bugs do not take prisoners.
carmen...?
excuse me...!
I am sorry, carmen.
please, i... everybody's lost someone by now. this should not be any different...
no, i... oh, zander, I am a fool.
you are upset, that is alright.
dizzy says you two knew this rasczak character in buenos aires...
he was our teacher... he was great.
yeah, well, i hear he is a real nutbuster.
seeing as how we are about all that is left of  1st brigade, you would have to call that an improvement.  you top kick ?
are you kidding ? they always get killed. you want the job ?
i would not mind.
i always wanted to go to zegema beach.
good luck. it is not there anymore.
where did you learn to do that, soldier ?
uni high tigers, sir. do not you remember ? i was captain of the team.
I am not interested in nostalgia, rico, i need a corporal. you are it until you are dead or i find someone better.
way to go, amigo !
I am going to need a squad leader.
no way. big k taught me i am not executive material.
what about it, diz ?
we must be right over the colony. let's get some air support, eh ?
yes, sir ! fleet, this is roughneck patrol, over ...?
corporal, i want pulse cannons there and there ! rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! sugar, bring up that flame thrower !
fleet's pulling the battle group back to safe distance... they would like us to knock out those batteries, sir.
they would rather spend our lives than risk their ships. who is got the nuke ?
you knew the lieutenant before the war... what was he like ?
he was a teacher , kind of a know it all... always had this little smile.
geez, i do not think I have ever seen him smile.
must fill your bottle up real quick when your wife and kids get smeared.
all dead except one, sir.
kill the bitch.
yes, sir.
c'mon...
nah, i do not do that anymore...
you used to dance...
i said no. want me to pull rank ?
well, excuse me, sir...
yopu asked me some advice once, rico. want some now ?
yes, sir...
never pass up a good thing, eh ?
hey, diz...
what ?
at 0821 we received a distress call from planet p, priority code, requesting reinforcement...
i thought 4th brigade cleaned out p.
owen reported the eradication of a low generation colony a month ago. that is why micom wants onsite assessment.
sounds more like some idiot at military intelligence command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed...
take your group down to p and have a look see. leave the thinking to us, lieutenant. that is not your job.
my job is to protect the lives of my soldiers so they can kill bugs, major, and if you are walking me into a trap-
bugs do not lay traps... they are not intelligent ! unlike you, they are stupid enough to follow orders !
corporal, the roughnecks are moving out for planet p immediately. get yourself squared away and report to gillespie for logistics.
yes, sir !
who is that with you ?
planet p ? what kind of name is that ?
they ran out of names a long time ago in this part of the galaxy.
i do not understand it, lieutenant. it is not getting anything from 4th brigade... not even their transponder.
keep trying, sergeant.
gillespie, put in call for retrieval. we are off this rock. gillespie, do you read me ?
aaaaaaaaaaa !
rico, you are acting sergeant now. my last sergeant lost the com pack. put together a search team and find the radio shack. we need retrieval.
yes, sir.
diz, see what you can do.
I am on it !
what is that look like to you, rico ?
looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
warm it all up ! everything you got ! levy, collect the big guns from the towers. watkins, put general owen with the wounded. rico, where is my communications ?
what is going on, diz ?
what frequency ?
all bands.
roughneck patrol to battle group... roughneck patrol to battle group...
this is rodger young... what is going on down there ? we are taking plasma ! we have orion p-11 as clear !
shut up, sir ! we need pick up now !
what is your position ?
landing zone is extremely hostile. come down on this transmission !
inside 4th brigade compound ? that is crazy !
then i hope you have a crazy pilot ! keep the line open, dizzy !
jeez, we musta killed a million already...!
not enough, i guess.
sergeant, secure the boat !
yes, sir !
aaaaaaaaaaaa !
cover us, ace !
hit your jets, sir !
i can not my legs are gone... get on the boat...
rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I have never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
we are not leaving you here, sir !
this is my farm. get on the boat, now ! that is an order, sergeant.
give'em hell, sir !
i bought the farm, did not i, johnny ?
no, you are going to be alright, diz !
it is alright 'cause i got to have you, johnny...
on whose authority, corporal ?
this would be mine, sir. acting sergeant john rico. I have assumed command on this mission.
johnny...! i thought you were dead !
I am not, but alot of my soldiers are. glass the planet !
...i'm sorry.
we got to choke on the mud and the blood and fleet can not be bothered to spit.
no, i think something is up. the sky marshall's here.
i thought you were kia, johnny...
that was just a mix up.
you look so... i do not know, you look like you have really been in it.
what happened to your eye ?
almost got knocked out of the sky over big k.
i like it. it is kinda...you.
where are you going ?
a funeral.
that girl who died on the way up ...his girl ?
yeah.
how do you feel about him now ?
i do not know, zander.
i do.
please continue, sergeant.
dizzy would not want our tears. she would want us to remember her... with a vengeance. so go out and kill a bug for dizzy. kill as many as you can. you are her revenge, and every bug you kill honors her death.
well, look at this. the three of us back together again.
how are you, carl ?
johnny, I am sorry it had to be your unit on planet p. that mission had a very low survival probability...
bugs laid a trap, did not they ?
elegant proof of intelligence, is not it ? we thought there might be a brain on p.
you do not approve. well, too bad. we are in this for the species, boys and girls. it is simple numbers, they have more, and everyday i have to make decisions that send hundreds of people like you to their deaths.
did not they tell you, colonel ? that is what cap troopres are good for.
hope you are ready for more. we are going back to p to capture that brain.
the roughnecks are always ready, sir.
i hear they need a new lieutenant... want the job ?
I will take it... until i get killed or you find someone better.
take care, wilya johnny ?
see you on the bounce !
where is lieutenant barcalow ?
he requested a combat assignment. there is always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. i had no choice but to let him go... he said you would understand.
we got reinforced. most of'em just got outa boot...
we are the old men, ace.
we will take this high ground. lookouts there and therte and up there. if the bugs come upstairs in this neighbor-hood, we will be the first to know.
got it. fleet tactical wants to know where they can deploy the skimmers.
down there on the flats, eh ? listen up, roughnecks ! our primary objective is to assist our friends from the fleet...
you are standing on my h.q., lieutenant !
this is a fleet-driven operation, son, and the fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. you can have everything else, eh ?
you heard the sky marshall... move it all down -
rodger young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I will take the first group.
saddle up, boys, that is our trash !
this is rodger young, we are going down... repeat, this is rodger young, we are going down...!
ibanez...let's go !
leave me, lieutenant ! that is an order !
no way, ma'am !
what is your problem now, lieutenant ?
the rodger young just burned up...
aaaaaaaaaaaaaa !
we have got to go get her !
we are outa here. lieutenant, get your men into the skimmers. this real estate's about to go buggy.
hey, just calm down, I am giving the orders here-
what do you think you are doing ?
I am going to save carmen.
that would mean a comlete disregard for the mission objective. they hang you for that, rico.
yeah, that is right.
let's go.
move out.
mr. barcalow, save power, do not waste it on workers... ace, tell aardvark we are on our way...
yes, sir !
can you walk ?
not a problem.
let's get some armor on her, and the we will get outa this stinkin bug hole !
i thought i was dead. lucky for me you jokers showed up, eh ?
it was not luck. rico ignored the mission objective to rescue you...
is it true ?
which way ?
up. we gotta be near a company by now.
how bad are you, pal ?
been better, buddy.
alright, we are going to carry you...
nah, i figureyou folks oughta get upstairs before it is too late... gimmee the nuke.
do not be a hero...
this is my farm. now c'mon, give me what you got and get out of here...
zander, what are you doing ?
just giving you something to remember me by, baby.
zander, no...!
you always told me you could not do human...
i can't... but like i told you, it is a number's game. the federation needs all the pilots it can get...
saddle up, roughnecks !
you heard the lieutenant ! on the bounce, troopers !
