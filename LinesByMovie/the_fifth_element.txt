lord forgive me.. they already know too, much..
"..in which all the history of the universe resides ..all the strength..all the hope..protect us from evil.."
amen..
father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
only too well... here you must be parched..
a weapon against evil.  amazing!  i am going to be famous.
then let us toast to your fame!  here billy..
drink!
to fame.. salud..
the fifth element...
take them and put them in a safe place.
will the elements be gone now forever from this place?
when mankind comes to its senses. we will return.
knowing mankind as i do, that could take centuries!
time is of no importance, only life is important.
when evil returns so shall we.
we will be ready, lord.
staedert, do you read me?
i can hear you, mr. president, but i can't see you .
is that better?
perfect, mr. president.
i have to address the supreme council in 10 minutes. just the facts, general.
there are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
what you are saying is you don't know what this..thing..is.
not yet sir..the only thing we know is it just keeps getting bigger!
options.
wait or act.
recommendations.
my philosophy mr. president is shoot first ask questions later. i don't like uninvited guests.
gentlemen?
imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. because it is evil.. total evil.
one more reason to shoot first eh?
your theory is interesting father but i don't think we have time to go into it right now!
time is of no importance, mr. president. only life is important.
that's exactly what we are going to try and do: protect the lives of some 200 billion of our fellow citizens! general? you may fire when ready.
staedert?  what's going on?  did you destroy it?
i'm about to, mr. president.
yeah?
hey bud! finger here.
i love you too major, but you haven't called me that since basic training.
i was talking to the cat.
oh, yeah, i forgot.you still prefer your cat to the real thing.
at least, the cat comes back.
you still pining for that two timing bitch. forget her. there are a million women out there.
i don't want a million - i just want one.  a perfect one.
don't exist bud.
i just found a picture of you.
how do i look?
like shit.
i don't need one.
you forgetting who sat next to you for a thousand missions. i know how you drive.
finger!  i'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
how many points you got left on your license?
uh... at least fifty.
in your dreams! see you tonight!
we have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
and then?
and then it will be too late. the goal of evil is to wipe out life! all forms of life. for all eternity...life upsets it.
is there anything that can stop it?
yes..thank god..
but what happens if instead of this... ultimate warrior... it is evil who stands here?
white turns to black.  light to dark. life to death.  for all eternity.
did you see that..thing..swallow our battleship like a gum drop?  you can't even tell me what it is! i ask you for options you give me bullshit. give them permission to enter our territories with my warmest regards.
thank you, mr. president.
the cash man!
been here long?
don't fuck with me man or i'll blow you into tomorrow!
isn't that a z140? alleviated titanium. neuro charged assault model?
uh..
you know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
it's not?
you gotta push the little yellow button...
thanks..
you're welcome..
welcome on board mr. dallas..
how you doing this morning?  sleep ok? i didn't.
fuel level 6.03..propulsion 2x4...
i had the worst goddamn nightmare.
you have nine points left on your license..
thanks for reminding me..
what are we going to do?
this is government business now. you ought to go home and get some rest, father.
this is all that survived?
actually only one cell survived..
have you identified it?
it's not that easy..we've never encountered anything like it before..you see normal human beings have 40 dna memo groums..which is more than enough for any species to perpetuate itself..this one has 200,000.
talk english doc.
this cell is like a huge library. it has infinite genetic knowledge stored inside. almost like it was...engineered.
sounds like a freak of nature to me.
yes... i can't wait to meet him.
the compositional elements of his dna chain are the same as ours, there are simply more of them tightly packed. his knowledge is probably limitless..
is there any danger? some kind of virus?
we put it through the cellular hygiene detector. the cell is for lack of a better word... perfect.
...this is the crucial phase, the reconstruction of pigment. cells are bombarded with slightly greasy solar atoms which forces the body cells to react, to protect themselves. that means growing skin. clever, eh?
wonderful!
this thing solid?
an elephant couldn't crack it.
akina delutan, nou-shan.
...'scuse me?
daya deo dono dato.  dalutan!
it there's one thing i don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
...priest...
you're not that bad... come on we'll get you to a doctor.
vito... cor... ni-lious... priest...
vito cornelius?
excuse me, i'm looking for a priest.
weddings are one floor down. congratulations.
she's not my bride, she's my fare. she's looking for this vito cornelius. according to the phone guide he lives here.
that's me.  but i don't know who she is... where did you find her?
she dropped in on me... holding this.
who are you?
i brought the girl remember?
the girl?
he's a she!
you noticed...
there's not a moment to lose! wake her up, but be gentle about it!  this woman is mankind's most precious possession! she is... perfect!
so you do know her.
uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
it's a miracle!!!
what is?
i can't wear these clothes! this calls for dignity! i have to dress the part!
eto akta gamat!
i'm sorry, it's just that... i was told to wake you up gently, so i figured...
father, will you please explain what's going on?
the supreme being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! it's a miracle!!!
...what's your name?
leeloo minai lekarariba-laminai-tchai ekbat de sebat.
hey,  that's... cute... do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
...leeloo.
appipulai leeloo minai..
corn-i-lius?
at your service.
father.  you sure she's the supreme being?
absolutely sure there's the triple suns on her gloves!
they all like this in your family, father?
she's an exception..
thank you so much for your help mr...?
dallas. korben dallas.
yes. that's fine! thank you very much. a thousand times over!
i might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
she's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
i know. i was there when she arrived.
excuse me! just one thing!  she said something to me a while ago and... i don't really get it... akta gamat?
it means, "never without my permission".
that's what i thought.
hello?
hey bud...i'm waiting all day here.
finger..man..i'm sorry..listen..i was on the way over but i had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
so, just how big was this fare?
5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
uh huh..and i don't suppose you got the name of this..perfect fare..
leeloo..
what's she doing?
learning our history! the last 5000 years that she missed! she's been out of circulation a while, you know.
what're you laughing about?
napoleon... small.
uh father, i know she's been through a lot... but the sacred stones..we don't have much time..
yes. of course..
the case..with the stones... where is it?
san agamat chay bet... envolet!
the case was stolen?
there was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... asking all these questions about the sacred stones..at the time i didn't think anything of it.. what was his name? i'm so bad with names...
i didn't know your size.
they really made her...
perfect.
ikset-kiba.  me imanetaba oum dalat!
you know exactly where they are!
...we're saved!
i'm fucked!
not going to open?
i've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
how someone strong like you scared from a message? is good news i sure!
the last two messages i got?  the first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! and the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
you right that is bad.. but mathematically luck must change! grandfather say: "it never rain every day." this is good news guarantee.. i bet you lunch!
at least i won lunch.
good philosophy..see good in bad.. i like..i prepare number one dessert.. special for you and pussy..
i got it!  everything  here we need to know about fhloston paradise hotel... and a detailed blueprint of the entire hotel!
good work, my son.  now all we need is a way to get there.
zorg. jean-baptiste emmanuel zorg... nice to see you again
i remember you now..the so called art dealer.
i'm glad you got your memory back, father... because you're going to need it... where are the stones?
...why on earth do the stones interest you?
personally, they are of no interest to me, i'd rather sell weapons..but i have a customer... so tell me...
even it i did know where the stones were i would never tell somebody like you.
why?  what's wrong with me?
...i'm a priest! i'm here to serve life, all you want to do is destroy it.
ah, father... you are so wrong. let me explain...
...would you like a drink?
no thank you.
follow me.. life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. look at this empty glass.
...look at all these little things... so busy all of a sudden. notice how each one is useful. what a lovely ballet, so full of form and color.  so full of..life!
they are robots!
father, by creating a little destruction, i am, in fact, encouraging life!  so, in reality, you and i are in the same business!
destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
let me reassure you father..i will never kill more people in my entire life than religion has killed in the last 2000 years.
you are a monster, zorg!
i know...
i managed to contact the mondoshawan. they deplore the incident, but accept our apologies.
and the stones?  did you find them in the wreckage?
the-stones weren't aboard the ship.
...what do you mean?
i want your best man on this!
don't worry, sir. i have the perfect one.
...hello?
you're the nastiest dirtbag i know in this stinking city!
hi ma...
i've been playing twice a week for 20 years, 20 years i've been eating those shitty croquettes.
are you listening to me, you ingrate!
yes ma..
other than that... you all right?
...and now you're making fun of me? i'm warning you! if you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, i'll never forgive you!!
i'm coming!. ma, what're you talking about?
i get it! you want to make me beg, is that it?
all i want is an explanation! i just got in, i lost my job. i smashed my cab. i got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, ma, thanks for asking!! now settle down and explain to me calmly..
you just won a trip, you dolt! ten days in fhloston paradise for two!
ma. if i'd won, i'd know about it. someone would have notified me.
they've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
major dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the federal army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
what mission?
to save the world.
where have i heard this song before?
you're to leave immediately for fhloston paradise. retrieve four stones from the diva plavalaguna. and bring them back with the utmost discretion as possible. any questions'?
just one... why me?
three reasons... one: as part of the elite special forces unit of the federated army you are an expert in the use of all weapons and spacecraft needed for this mission.
two: of all the members of your unit you were the most highly decorated.
and the third one?
you're the only one left alive...
don't you open your messages?
i've had enough good news for today
you have won the annual gemini contest and a trip to fhloston paradise. for two. congratulations. here are your tickets.
you couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
old tricks are the best tricks eh?
i'm not going.
why not?
one reason... i want to stay the only one left alive.
...shit!
what is it?
it's my wife.
i thought you were divorced.
i mean my future.. my ex.. my future ex.. if she sees you here i'm finished.  she hates you guys. it's what killed us in the first place. please...
...sorry, general, but we've got no choice! it'll only take a minute! let me set up another meeting and i'll be back.
three of us will never fit in there!
oh, yes you will...
apipoulai!
i suppose that means "hi" ?
i'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to fhloston.
is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
we're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
what kind of mission?
we have to save the world.
good luck..
of course.
father, i was in the army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was i lost a lot of friends. so thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
i'm sorry..
this is a police control action..
what are you doing?
trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
valo massa... chacha hamas.
uh..you're welcome.
you hear that?
cornelius..
oh god!
vano da, mechteba?! soun domo kala chon hammas!
no, i'm not proud of myself... but we don't have the luxury of choice.
yeah?
have you pulled yourself together?
...not yet.
akta dedero ansila do mektet.
i can't pretend to be your husband... david's in great shape.
dinoine chagantakat!
took the words right out of my mouth. go on... i'll be right with you.  it's our honeymoon. we're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
where's leeloo?
on the plane... with mr. dallas... the real one.
it's all my fault.  i'm the servant... it's my mission! here!
...hi.
does it get any better or what!
...quiver ladies, he's gonna set the world on fire right here from 5 to 7! you'll know everything there is to know about the d-man. his dreams, his desires, his most intimate of intimates.  and from what i'm looking at intimate is the stud muffin's middle name. so tell me my main man... you nervous in the service?
uh... not really.
i didn't come here to play dumbo on the radio. so tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
crystal.
apipoulai!
not hard to find you...just follow the chaos...
love...
yes! but "love" isn't the operative word here, peace is!
sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
what is... make love?
finished what?
learning language.
which one?
all 900.
you learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
yes! now it's your turn! i learned your language, you have to learn mine!
i know how to say "hello". teach me how to say "good-bye", that's all i need.
apipoussan!
apipoussan?
good! do you know how we say "make love"?
uh...
...hoppi-hoppa.
am i disturbing you?
no... not at all.  where are you?
...not far, now.
really? maybe i can get you on my screen and see you at last!
do you have the picture now mr. zorg?
got it.
how's our deal coming along?
fine, just fine!  i'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  but it wasn't easy. my costs have tripled.
the stones will be here. i'll see to it personally!
...i can't wait to be among you.
my main man! please don't leave me here alone. my head's killing me and my adoring fans are gonna tear me apart! get me outta here!
i'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
oh, yes! do that! you treat me right, man. tell me all about yourself, your roots, your personal life, your childhood dreams...
i don't think this is a good time...
...you got brothers and sisters? what about your dad? tell me about your dad! what was he like? physically? big, i suppose?
yeah, very big, a giant.
i didn't have a dad... never saw him... never even heard him. 50 billion people listen to me every day... and he doesn't hear me...
hello?
you little sleaze bag!
...ma???
don't you ever ask me for another thing in my life again, you've killed your poor mother with your own hands!
here we go again...
you know women normally change five times more than men.
you get that off the screen?
yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
you noticed..
ok, you can turn around!
where you going?
i'm going to see the diva sing. what's the matter?... do i look bad?
no, not at all!  i mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
i told you i need to work in peace. remember? i need to concentrate.
and you can't concentrate with me around?.
it's difficult.
you're nothing but a... a...
the words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. i won't be long.
you're a good man... she was right to have chosen you...
who?
the fifth element... the supreme being... your wife...
leeloo... is... she's...
yes, and more than that... you must give her the stones, she's the only one who knows how to use them.
...so cornelius was telling the truth!
she was taught to love the life of others... but not her own. you have to teach her to love if you want her to truly live!
i'll help her, i promise, but i think you should tell me where the stones are!
do you love her?
i... i don't know! we hardly know each other... it takes time!
i don't have time... i need to know.
listen, the last time i admitted to a woman i loved her ... i never saw her again.
i would like to have died in peace...
i'm sorry, but... the stones...
they are... with me...
you don't do what i say... i'll waste you myself. got it?
got it...
six to the left. one to the right.
he's on vacation.
we got to find the leader. mangalores don't fight without a leader.
you're probably very angry with me and i quite understand. but i want you to know i'm fighting for a noble cause.
yeah, i know... to save the world... but right now all i want to do is save leeloo.
leeloo's in trouble?
when is she not in trouble?
uh.. have you tried the diva's suite?
maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
not without leeloo.
like korben, can i have 30 seconds of your time here?
i'll be right back.
you know how to fly this thing?
it's like a cab isn't it?
30 seconds...
anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
6... 5...
found it?
i don't even know what i'm looking for!
fuck it! hold tight!
solid little jobs, aren't they?
dear listeners, your favorite dj is alive and kicking. it's seven o'clock and time for the news. tune in tomorrow for another adventure.
how's that? can you hear me better now?
yes, mr. zorg, i hear you perfectly! so, how was the concert?
who gives a shit! i didn't come here to listen to music! listen up instead of running off at the mouth! the batteries on my phone are almost gone.
yes, sir!
dispatch me another zfx200 immediately. someone stole mine.
right away, sir. i'll send you a new one to the hotel.
i'm not at the hotel!
i'm so very sad.
why? we did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
five hundred wars... arms... drugs... money... everything you create is used to destroy...
i told you not to read all that crap!
protect life... until death.
you're all safe. thanks be to god!
later, david! later! there's not a minute to lose!
they just landed in the desert.
how much time is left?
don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
theoretically, yes! the four stones form the beam and the fifth element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... i don't have the reference book. i've never seen the stones work!
there's no light! you told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
yes, of course, but... the stones are shut! they have to be open for it to work.
and you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
that's what i'm saying.
leeloo? the stones! we have to open them! how does it work?
the wind blows... the fire burns...
i know all that, leeloo! i'm talking about the stones.
...the rain falls...
what did you say? what did you do?
nothing! swear to god, i didn't do nothing!
look, you did something that set it off. try to remember. concentrate. tell me exactly what you did!!
is that all?
yeah... then i sighed... like this.
it's up to you now, angel!
i'm so tired...
you can sleep tomorrow... come on...
i want to sleep... forever...
leeloo! listen to me! i'll take you on a vacation afterwards! a real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. come on! you can do it!
what's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
you're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
...like love...
exactly.
but i don't know love... i'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
i have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... there is no need for me other than this. i'm immortal but i have no life.
yes, you do! i need you. more than you can imagine! stand up straight!
why?... why would you need me?
because...
tell me...
i love you...
mr. president, let me introduce you to professor mactilburgh, who runs the center.
it's an honor to receive you. mr. president.
