i want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
you look pretty healthy to me.
I am the next one.
how do ya know that?
because i quit breathing.
you are breathin' right now.
whatcha boys playin'?
h-h-hearts.
shoot! no wonder you do not care nothin' 'bout showin' your hand.
what is your name, buddy?
b-b-billy.
well, put 'er there, billy boy, my name's mcmurphy.
what i wanna know is who is the top loony around here?
y-y-you m-mean th-the pr-president of the p-p-patients c-council?
yeah, that will do for openers!
h-h-harding, the m-m-man w-wants to t-talk to you, y-you're the pr-pr pr...
what for?
what for?
what are you doing?
I am seeing what a busy man does.
do not you have any clubs?
no!
let me see your hand!
no!
well, if you gentlemen will excuse me, i have some pressing matters to attend to.
easy now, do not smudge 'em, we got lots of games ahead of us...
mister mcmurphy!
yes, ma'am...
will you come with me, please.
hold the fort down, will ya, fellas!
my name is miss ratched. I am the head nurse here. you have already met miss pilbow and aides washington and warren.
yes, ma'am.
we do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
thank you, ma'am...
this is your bed. you may leave your things in that cabinet.
yes, ma'am...
please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, do not hesitate to ask us.
now that you mention it, i sure would like to call my aunt up in portland and tell 'er where i am so she can come visit me.
all in good time, mister mcmurphy. all in good time.
yes, ma'am.
good. now if you will just go along with mister washington, he will see that you are properly oriented.
is there anything else?
just that I am glad to be here, miss ratched. i really am.
good. I am sure we will be friends.
yeah, you am not half so bad looking for a head nurse.
yes. now go along, mister mcmurphy. go along.
yes, ma'am.  lead the way, sam.
hell, doc, I have been everything from a hoopla man with a two-bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the northwest till the army taught me what my natural bent was.
oh, what was that?
poker!
i see.
yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.
in what way?
they say I am a habitual hassler. like i fight some. sheeut. they did not mind so much when i was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. that is a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. but if you are a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you are a goddamned criminal.
i see...
to tell the truth, ever since i found my natural callin' i done time in so many small-time jails i could write a brochure...
yes... ah, do you know why you are here?
well, ya know, doc...  does not it say so there?
well, according to the warden at pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'it appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'  what do you think of that report?
i don't, doc...
arrested on an assault charge five times...
that is correct, doc ...
the doctor at the prison states: 'don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' what do you say to that?
doc, what can i tell ya?
ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, mister murphy?
no, this is my first trip, doc.
well, you are here for a ninety-day observation period, mister mcmurphy. I would like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. so, I would like your cooperation!
you bet, doc!
good. good.
at the close of friday's meeting, we were discussing mister harding's problem, concerning his wife...  mister harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. is that correct, mister harding?
yes, that is perfectly correct.
he also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he did not say how. he has been heard to say to his wife, 'i hate you, i do not ever want to see you again. you have betrayed me.'  so. does anyone care to touch upon this further?
mister mcmurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. however, the cardinal rule, and i must emphasize this: everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
yeah, well, it just pains me somethin' awful to see a full growed man sloshing around in his own water...
yes... we were discussing mister harding's problem with his wife. now, who will start?  billy.
m-m-m-ma'am?
would you like to start?
n-n-n-n-n-no, ma'am.
mister sefelt?
am i to take it that there is not a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter?  mister harding, you have stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
yes, miss ratched, this is correct.
but you have no proof.
no, miss ratched...
and yet you suspect her.
yes, that is correct.
why?
i can only speculate as to the reasons why.
have you ever speculated, mister harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?
miss ratched. given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that i held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that i can speculate on, at this late date, is how i will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.
what is he talkin' about?
yes, billy?
i-i-i-i-i d-d-don't s-s-see how anyone could lu-lu-lu-love a man who t-t-t-talks the way he does.
yeah, harding, where do you breathe anyway?
through the ass.
no secrets, mister harding. let's get it all out in the open...
i mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. i know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that is your idea of teaching me something...
well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those group ther'py shindigs? bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
a pecking party?
that is right, buddy. and you want to know who pecks the first peck?
it is as simple as that. you have been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of freud, jung and maxwell jones in one grand analogy: it is a pecking party.
I am not talking about fred yoong or maxwell jones, buddy, what I am talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you!
did to me?
did to you and all the rest of you guys.
y-y-yes! yes! y-y-y-you s-s-saw wh wh-what she c-c-can do to us!
what did i see 'cept a grown man gettin' whipped so bad he can not laugh anymore.
it is the questions she asks.
tell 'er to go straight to hell!
miss ratched is a competent psychiatric nurse, not some, some kind of monster pecking out our eyes!
she am not peckin' at your eyes, buddy.
that kind of behavior will get you a p.a. rating, my friend.
p.a. what the hell is that?
potential assaultive.
which gets you shipped up to disturbed for a nice little zap job.
huh?
electro-shock therapy, my friend. five cents' worth of electricity and you are out of everybody's hair.
tell 'er to go to hell anyway!
and if you persist in your ways, they can always ship you over to medical surgery.
what for?
lobotomy!
lobotomy?
that!
is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
now, what would i be trying to say?
gimme the ball!
no. me! me!
hit me!
hit, you say? well well well and with a king up, the boy wants a hit. whadaya know. so comin' at you and too bad, a little lady for the lad and he is over the wall and down the road, up the hill and dropped his load.
boogered!
'kay, place your bets.
what is this?
that is a dime, martini.
bet a nickel!
whadaya bet, cheswick?
she will not give me any more cigarettes!
that okay. I will take your marker. how many ya want?
lend me twenty.
big king... little deuce... another king... a lovely lady... big ten... and a trey... hey, hey, whadaya say? ya hit or sit, martini?
hit me.
that is twenty up, martini.  hey, taber, who is pitching the opening game?
hit me!
wait a minute, martini, i can not hear a thing.  what?
pardon me miss, but would you mind turning...
stay back! patients are not allowed to enter the... oh, stay back!
all I am askin' is...
mister mcmurphy. patients are not allowed in here.
sorry, ma'am.
pardon me, ma'am, can i ask you somethin'?
yes, mister mcmurphy?
how 'bout turning off that music for a while so a man can hear himself think?
that music is for everyone, mister mcmurphy.
well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man do not have to shout!
mister mcmurphy, there are old men here who could not hear the music at all if it were lower. that music is all they have, and i wish you would not lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
sorry to have bothered you.
not at all, mister mcmurphy...
your medicine, mister mcmurphy.
what is the horse pill for, honey?
it is just medication, mister mcmurphy, good for you. now down it goes...
look, miss, i do not like swallowing something without knowing what it is!
do not get upset, mister mcmurphy...
I am not upset. all i wanna know, for the lovva jesus...
that is all right, miss pilbow, if mister mcmurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...
no, that is okay, ma'am. down it goes.
you boys seem to think you have got a champ in there, huh?
i do not see you scoring any points, buddy. and you are just the man for the job, right?
hell, i could not get it up over old hatchet-face if ya paid me!
she is not all that homely, mister mcmurphy. in fact, she must have been a rather beautiful young lady.
yeah, an' I am tellin' ya, she is just an icy-hearted over-the-hump gal who never got enough of the old wham-bam to straighten 'er out... okay, who wants a card?
me. hit me!
mister mcmurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
i wanna report a robbery!
on this ward?
yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
oh, i had them removed.
what for?
patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day.
yes, miss ratched?
please see to mister bromden.
yes, miss ratched...
now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  you too, mister mcmurphy.
well, say. how 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
after breakfast, mister mcmurphy, after breakfast.
you sure run a tight-assed ship 'round here, do not ya!
yes. now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly.
stand aside, sam, nature's callin'.
nobody leaves here till seven thirty.
do not know if i can hold it that long, sam.
tha's your problem.
who do you like in the opening game, sam?
huh?
asshole.
yes, mister mcmurphy.
right... I have been givin' some serious consideration to what you told me about the democratic something of this therapeutic community of ours, an' i got a few things i wanna get off my chest, before we get back to harding's problem.
certainly, mister mcmurphy.
right!
well, i was turnin' this dilemma over in my head, when i happened to hit on that old tub room out there, an' i said to myself, mcmurphy, i said, that place would make a great second day room. a sort of game room for the young fellas. whadaya think, doc?
it is worth considering... miss ratched?
I am not finished yet.
go on...
'kay, item two. tomorrow, and listen carefully to me, you ding-a lings. tomorrow is the opening game of the world series an' what i want is to take a vote on switchin' the group meetin' to later on in the day, so we can watch the ballgame.
just a minute, mister mcmurphy!
yeah?
please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
the hell with the schedule, you can get back to the schedule next week when the series is over. what i want is a vote on it right now!
i second the motion!
atta boy, cheswick!
yes. now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, mister mcmurphy?
no way.
yes, mister harding?
yes, thank you, miss ratched. since our last meeting i have been reflecting, quite seriously, on the nature of my problem. naturally, I am referring to the capacity to obtain the necessary results in order to obtain... no, no. to personify the very existence of that relationship regardless of the function...  regardless of the function, we will confront the question of... yes. yes. the question of... existence... relationship... function... confront... yes, confronting us in the moment of deepest crisis... yes, the crisis of our souls. of our souls, which i am trying to fully understand the problem... the problem. not to shut ourselves off, but somehow... somehow to understand fully our capacity... to obtain... to personify... the question... existence depends... depends on the question... to reflect... to reflect...
you need four houses on every lot of the same color, martini. now let's go, for christsakes.
hold it a minute.
let's go, for christsakes...
it is your dirty roll, cheswick.
you just come on with that three fifty and martini will take care of himself... your dice, scanlon.
gimme those dice. I will blow this board to pieces. here we go...  lebenty leben, count me over eleven, martini...
break it up, god dammit! am not i got enough troubles without you guys messin' around... can not depend on nobody.
some of us ha-ha-have b-b-been here a long t-t-time, randle, and will b b-be here long after this wo-wo world series of yours is oh-oh-oh, what is the use anyway...
what is the use! hooee! it would do you birds some good just to get a little exercise lifting your arms to vote!
a baseball game is not worth the risk, my friend.
it is to me! an' if i hafta bust way outta this place to see it, i will!
yeah!
big man!
yeah, how much you wanna bet?
on what?
that me an' my buddy, cheswick, we will be downtown tomorrow watchin' the ballgame while you suckers are sittin' around this goddamn nursery!
and how do you propose to accomplish that little feat, my friend?
that is between me an' myself. so why do not you boys just shove off. i got some planning to do.
maybe I will just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, sefelt.
why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, mcmurphy.
you think it is funny, huh?
yeah, you do not know how to get outta this place!
put your money where your mouth is, taber.
yeah, yeah, you are a fucking phony, mcmurphy!
you want me to show ya! you want me to show ya how!
yeah, yeah, show me. show me how!
all right!
with this thing! I am going to put this thing right through the window, that is how!
you mean you are going to try to pick that thing up and shove it through the window?
you are fuckin' a-right, i am!
with your own two hands?
you heard me the first time!
I will bet a buck you do not do it!
you are on!
m-m-mack, y-y-y-you c-c-can't l-l lift that thing!
stand aside, son. any more takers?
I will bet a dollar.
me, too...
right!
a nickel.
a dime.
okay. who else?
twenty-five dollars.
okay, harding, you are on.
okay, sucker.
yeah... okay, stand aside, you guys! you are usin' up my oxygen!
giving up?
just warmin' up.
that is okay, kid...
th-th-then y-y-you're n-n-not m-m mad?
no, kid, it was my own stupidity, that is what pissed me off.
o-o-o-oh...
what we are going to have to do is pull this ballclub together for our next play. 'kay!
'k-k-kay, mack!
was it your idea to visit her on sunday?
y-y-y-yes...
tell us about it...
i-i-i-i c-c-c-came over s-s-s sunday m-m-m-morning after ch-ch-ch church and br-br-brought her s-s some flowers, and i s-s-said, i said, 'c-c-c-celia, will you muh muh-muh-muh-muh...' till the girl broke out l-l-laughing.
what was it about her that disturbed you so, billy?
i was in luh-love with her.
billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?
that was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, was not it?  you must try to talk about it, billy.
jesus christ, the man does not want to talk, so get off his back an' let's get on to some new business.
mister mcmurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. group therapy.
yeah, yeah, the hell with that crap! the world series is goin' on right' now an' that is therapy also!
let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that mister mcmurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
what the hell does that have to do with it? this is an important event and i want a vote on it!
yeah, it will satisfy me.
very well. what is it you are proposing, mister mcmurphy?
I am proposing a re-vote on watchin' the ballgame!
a vote is before the group.
okay, i wanna see the hands. i wanna see which of you birds has any guts.
everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
that is it! we made it!
I am sorry, mister mcmurphy, i count only eight.
so do i!
but there are eighteen patients on the ward, mister mcmurphy.
you mean to tell me you are going to count those old birds over there?
I am sorry, mister mcmurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
well, I will be a son-of-a-bitch...
you mean you do not want their votes to count, billy!
i-i-i...
mister mcmurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
he is into his wind-up. here comes the pitch. strike on the inside corner!
you men remain seated!
he is into his wind-up. here's the next pitch... and it is a hit! it is a hit!
i saw thum! i saw thum!
me, too! me, too!
yes, i see it! i see it!
ya-hoo, let's'play ball!
how are you feeling?
just fine, doc... in fact, i think i might have put on a couple of pounds since i got here.
good, good, and how are you getting along on the ward?
come on, doc, you know as well as i do what is been comin' down in that loony bin.
yes, well, miss ratched feels that you are a disturbing influence on the other patients.
shoot, doc, the only one I am disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. that is all.
yes, that may be so, but in making a careful study of your past record, along with your behavior since you arrived here, my feeling is that you are not mentally ill and it is going to be my recommendation that you be returned to pendleton where they are better equipped to handle your case.
come on, doc, you must be kiddin'.
I am afraid not.
jesus, that old nurse sure wants my ass in a sling, do not she!
no, mister mcmurphy, it is just that we cannot offer you the guidance and assistance that you would receive at pendleton.
guidance and assistance! that is insane! doc, ya got to help me.
I am sorry, but i can not keep you here.
when?
we will let you know.
he can not hear you!
i know, goddammit! you do not have ta tell me that!
so why are you talking to him?
I am not talkin' to him! I am talkin' to myself! it helps me think!
it does not help him.
well, it does not hurt him either!  does it, chief!  see, it does not hurt him.  jump! an' put it in!
ha! did ya see that!  hey, cheswick!
