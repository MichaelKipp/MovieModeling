a third stage guild navigator will be here within minutes!
we felt his presence.
i shall want telepathy during his visit and a report when we're finished.
their minds are so.... they move in strange directions....
yes?
forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... i must sit close to him.
he will not permit anyone but me to see him. you must be outside this room.... do what you can.
i am your truthsayer, my lord...  he is here, my lord.
yes, my lord.
we are alone...
we have just folded space from ix...
yes?... how was your journey?
many machines on ix... new machines.
oh yes? -- navigator better than those on richesse.. you are transparent... i see many things... i see plans within plans.
i see two great houses -- house atreides, house harkonnen -- feuding... i see you behind it.
yes.
you must share with us. -- emperor the atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. the duke is becoming more popular in the landsraad... he could threaten me.... i have ordered house atreides to occupy arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the harkonnens.... house atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. then, at an appointed time baron harkonnen will return to arrakis and launch a sneak attack on house atreides... i have promised the baron five legions of my sardaukar terror troops.
so the harkonnens will rid you of house atreides...
yes.
can you hear me?... if this visit has anything to do with spice... -- the guild navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.
listen to me!! the spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.
i can assure you...
do not interrupt!!! do not speak lightly of the spice... one small point...
i heard you, dr. yueh and gurney coming down the hall.
those sounds could be imitated.
i'd know the difference.
yes. perhaps he would at that.
my father sent you to test me. music then?
no music. i'm packing this for the crossing. shield practice.
shield practice? gurney... we had practice -- this morning..... i'm not in the mood.
not in the mood?! mood's a thing for cattle and love play... not fighting.
i'm sorry gurney.
not sorry enough.
what's gotten into gurney? he's not faking. paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. the smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and spark off one another. paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin gurney against the table top with his blade right at gurney's neck.
is this what you seek?
good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.
we'd have joined each other in death. however, you did seem to finally get the "mood".
would you really have drawn my blood?
if you'd fought one whit below your abilities i'd have scratched you a good one.
things have been so serious here lately.
yes. i sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. tomorrow we leave for arrakis! arrakis is real. the harkonnens are real.
many dangers exist on arrakis. for one, we know the harkonnens would not have given up their choam company contract so easily.
the harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, i suspect, is the emperor. -- thufir you will make a formidable duke!
now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.
i know.  but if it is a trap then why are we going?
we have our new army.  dr. yueh, put the weirding module on him.
paul, this is the reverend mother gaius helen mohiam. she is going to... observe you...  please... -- reverend mother jessica, you know it must be done. i enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
your reverence.
what does she fear?  what about my father?
paul... please, paul... listen to the reverend mother and do what she tells you.
what's in the box?
pain.
the voice again.
i hold at your neck the gom jabbar. don't pull away or you'll feel that poison. a duke's son must know about many poisons -- this one kills only animals.
are you suggesting a duke's son is an animal?
let us say i suggest you may be human. your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts. your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. if you do so you will die. you will feel an itching -- there... see? now the itching becomes burning... heat, upon heat, upon heat.
it burns.
silence... silence.
i must not fear. fear is the mind-killer. fear is the little death that brings total obliteration. i will face my fear... i will permit it to pass over me and through me. -- the reverend mother moves her face up to his. her ancient face with its metal teeth gleaming inches away breathes hotly. she is smiling.
you feel the flesh crisping?
the pain!
no!! enough!! kull wahad! no woman child ever withstood that much. i must have wanted you to fail. take your hand out of the box and look at it, young human.... do it!
pain by nerve induction... a human can resist any pain. our test is crisis and observation.
i see the truth of it. -- reverend mother  could he be the one?... maybe... but will he be ours to control?  you know when people speak the truth?
your mother wants you to tell me about your dreams. i only want to know one thing.... do they come true?
not all of them... i know which ones will.
perhaps you are the kwisatz haderach.
what is it?
the person who can be many places at once... the one who bridges space and time.... he will look where we cannot.
where?
do you know of the water of life?... the truthsayer drug?
i have heard of it. -- reverend mother it is very dangerous... very painful. the bene gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within.... there is a place terrifying to us... to women. it is said a man will come... the kwisatz haderach... he will go where we cannot... many men have tried...
did they try and fail?
they tried and died....  jessica!
i sense your teachings in him. ignore the regular order of training. his safety requires the voice.
i've heard enough of my safety... what about my father?... i heard you talking. you speak as if he was dead. well, he isn't!
well he isn't... and he won't die... tell me he won't die!
what can be done has been done.
mother! tell me!
my lord!
piter.
the atreides will be leaving caladan soon, baron, and i have here your answer from duke leto.
what does leto say, piter?
he wishes to inform you that vendetta -- as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of kanly -- is still alive. he does not wish to meet or speak with you.
i made my peace gesture... the forms of kanly have been obeyed.
you know the ancient tongues?
i know the bhotani jib and chakobsa, all the hunting languages.
as the legend says.
that's it! the missionaria protectiva has been here planting protective legends against a day of bene gesserit need. and that day has come. i must play out this sham.  i know the dark things and the way of the great mother. miseces prejin.
do you know this my lady?
it could only be one thing....  it's a crysknife.
say it not lightly...  do you know its meaning?
here is why this fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. delay is as dangerous as the wrong answer. shadout is chakobsa... knife, in chakobsa is... maker of death.  it's a maker...
maker?... maker is the key word... the tooth of the worm? that was close...  did you think that i, knowing the mysteries of the great mother, would not know the maker?
my lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.
so, this is leto the just...
i hope i made myself clear. you may call him "the duke," "my lord," or "sire." and there is a more ancient term you might keep in mind -- "noble born."
play out your little comedy while you can off-worlders...
so you are dr. kynes, the imperial ecologist?
i prefer the more ancient term, planetologist... noble born.
this is my son, paul.
are you a fremen?
i am a servant of the his majesty the emperor. i have served his majesty on arrakis long enough for my eyes to change.
he's hiding something.
i understand we have you to thank for these stillsuits, doctor.
they are fremen suits. i hope they fit well, my lord.
the duke is to be addresses as... -- kynes comes forward and adjusts the duke's suit, checking seals and pulling on straps.
basically...
sire!
yes, sire.
it's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. the salt is separated. breathing and walking provide the pumping action. the reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.
my thanks.
with your permission...
you've worn a stillsuit before?
no.
your suit is fitted desert fashion. who told you how to do that?
no one. it... seemed the proper way.
that it is.  he shall know your ways as if born to them.
will we see a worm?
where there is spice and spice mining there are always worms.
always?
always.
why do they come?
to protect their territory. vibrations attract them. -- paul  i've registered him now... a knife is a sheath on his left arm... he's strong... a person born to command... he's hiding many things.  is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?
dust cloud ahead, sire.
that's it... spice mining... no other cloud quite like it. see the spotters over it? they're watching for wormsign... the telltale sand waves. seismic probes on the surface, too sire... worms can travel too deep for their waves to show... looks like a good patch of spice.
what happens now?
the carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting sire. -- the duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. paul can see...
spice!... pure un-refined spice!
bless the maker and his water... bless the coming and going of him.  may his passage cleanse the world.
what's that you're saying?
nothing.
liet?
you are about to witness something few have seen -- watch!  watch!
don't touch my mother...
oh great mother!  he's trying the voice. the reverend mother said it could save him.
remove her gag!
excellent!
it was feyd?  it was feyd!  where is the ducal signet ring?  i must have his ring.
the ring?... he was brought to us as is, baron.  i...
you killed the doctor too soon, you fool!
i can't maintain any altitude... we'll never reach the safety of rock.  maybe that small rock.
where are we do you think?
the south polar regions... the forbidden area.  we must make it to that rock...
a million deaths are not enough for yueh...
where are my feelings... i feel for no one...
listen to me!... you wanted to know about my dreams... and i've just had a waking dream... do you know why?... -- jessica calm yourself/
the spice!  it's in everything here.  the air, the soil, the food...  it's like the truthsayer drug.....  it's a poison!!!! you knew the spice would change me.  but thanks to your teachings it's changed my consciousness.  i can see it... i can see it.
is he....?
you carry my unborn sister in your womb!
he knows.
you and your bene gesserit sisterhood... i'm not your kwisatz haderach...  i'm something different, something unexpected!  i'm a seed.  i am so much more...  you don't begin to know me...
it's further than i thought... a worm is sure to come....  i'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. -- paul moves off into the shadows.  suddenly, jessica sees a burst of lightning illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.
...the night is a tunnel... a hole into tomorrow... if we're to have a tomorrow...
remember... walk without rhythm and we won't attract a worm... it'll go to the thumper.
i'm ready.
run!
i can't... i can't.
cinnamon... the spice!  do you smell it?
yes...
i know the secret.  the worm is the spice... the spice is the worm.
what's happened?...  why did it leave?
someone started another thumper....  we're not alone.
man-carved steps.
yes...
perhaps these are the ones mapes told us of.
are you trained in the ways of the desert?
no, but many consider my training valuable.
i will take the boy-man... he shall have sanctuary in my tribe... -- a low note on a dip stick is blown by one of the fremen tribe.  jessica shifts, paul sees it, and just as stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, jessica turns, slashes out, utters a sound, whirls again and with rock behind her holds stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. paul moves on her first move.  he races up a rocky incline.
stop!  get back!!  she has the weirding way.  why didn't you tell us!  great gods... if you can do this to the strongest of us you're worth ten times your weight of water.  as a leader of my people i give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall have sanctuary.  your water shall mingle with our water.
then i will teach you our way of battle....  you have the word bond of a bene gesserit.
you have strength... real strength... you shall be known as usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar.  this is your secret name in our troop.  but you must choose the name of manhood which we will call you openly.
what do you call the mouse shadow in the second moon?
we call that one muad'dib.
could i be known as paul muad'dib?
you are paul muad'dib, and your mother shall be a sayyadina among us....  we welcome you.
water on arrakis!!! i have seen this place in a dream.  a treasure.
greater than treasure, usul.  we have thousands of such caches.  only a few of us know them all.  when we have enough... we shall change the face of arrakis. listen!...
sayyadina.  our reverend mother tells me she is too old... she has been calling through space and time for you to come and let her rest.  she asks that you pass within.
they want me to take the water of life... the truthsayer drug... so dangerous, yet... we must move swiftly if we're to secure our place among these fremen.  i will try to pass within.
death may be the result....  are you sure?
i must do this for paul, but what of my unborn child?
the water of life.
the most lethal poison in the universe.
... many men have tried.
did they try and fail?
they tried and died.
my own name is a killing word.  will it be a healing word as well?
usul... these are fifteen of our fiercest fighters to serve you as your guard... the fedaykin.
we surprised a band of smugglers.
too bad... thought they were harkonnen.
you've no need of your weapons with me gurney halleck.
paul!!  paul!!
don't you trust your own eyes.
they said you were dead.  they said...
long live the fighters!
long live the fighters!
gurney... i see thufir hawat among the captives.  let him stand free.
my lord?
let him stand free!
don't try your powers on me.  try looking into that place where you dare not look. you'll find me there staring back at you!! you bene gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required.  here i stand.  but... i will never be yours.
stop him, jessica!
stop him yourself.
you saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning.  in time you perverted the truth.  you sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.  how little you understand.
you mustn't speak of...
silence!
this is a harkonnen animal.  let me, please, my lord.
the emperor's blade.
