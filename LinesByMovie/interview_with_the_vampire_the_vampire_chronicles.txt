so you want me to tell you the story of my life...
that is what i do. i interview people. i collect lives. f.m. radio. f.f.r.c. i just interviewed a genuine hero, a cop who -
you would have to have a lot of tape for my story. I have had a very unusual life.
so much the better. I have got a pocket full of tapes.
you followed me here, did not you?
saw you in the street outside. you seemed interesting. is this where you live?
it is just a room...
so shall we begin?  what do yo do?
I am a vampire.
see? i knew you were interesting. you mean this literally, i take it?
absolutely. i was watching you watching me. i was waiting for you in that alleyway. and then you began to speak.
well, what a lucky break for me.
perhaps lucky for both of us.
you were going to kill me? drink my blood?
yes but you need not worry about that now. things change.
you believe this, do not you? that you are a vampire? you really think...
we can not begin this way. let me turn on the light.
but i thought vampires did not like the light.
we love it. i only wanted to prepare you.
how did you do that?
the same way you do it. a series of simple gestures. only i moved too fast for you to see. I am flesh and blood, you see. but not human. i have not been human for two hundred years.
what can i do to put you at ease? shall we begin like david copperfield? i am born, i grow up. or shall we begin when i was born to darkness, as i call it. that is really where we should start, do not you think?
you are not lying to me, are you?
why should i lie? 1791 was the year it happened. i was twenty-four - younger than you are now.
yes.
but times were different then. i was a man at that age. the master of a large plantation just south of new orleans...
they would have killed you -
then my luck would have changed.
you want death? is it death you want?
yes...
who the hell are you? what are you doing in my house?
and a beautiful house it is too. yours is a good life, is not it?
you are not afraid of anything, are you?
why should i be?
what do you want from me?
I have come to answer your prayers. you want to die, do not you? life has no meaning anymore, does it?
diane!!!!
they are gone, louis. death took them. death which you can now destroy...
no!!!!!
you have to ask me for this. you have to want it, do you hear me?
give it to me!!!
vampires. we thrive on blood.
i want it!
you let your overseer run riot, work your slaves to the bone. we will start with him.
how do you mean, start?
call him.
let's call that a start.
i can not do it.
you have just done it -
kill me if you will, but i can not do this...
do not worry. he was white trash, they come at two a penny. i dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
you are the devil, are not you? that is who you are.
i wish i were. but if i were, what would i want with you?
i can not go through with it, i tell you.
your perfect. your bitter and you are strong.
but why do you want me?
because you are as strong as i was when i was alive.
you really want to be with them?
yes. kill me. kill me like you promised -
you asked for death. i did not promise it -
did i hear a yes?
yes...
you are sure?
sure...
you are body's dying. pay no attention. it will take twenty minutes at most.
dying?
come, you are going to feed now.
i want a woman.
take him.
the crucifix -
forget the crucifix. take him.
what have i done?
you have fed. you were made for this...
dear god, what have i done?
you have killed louis. and enjoyed it.
you said the slave had a crucifix...
oh, that rumour about crosses?
you can not look at them...
nonsense, my friend. i can look on anything i like. and i am particularly fond of looking on crucifixes.
the story about stakes through the heart?
the same. as you would say today... bull shit.
what about coffins?
coffins... coffins unfortunately are a necessity...
yes, that is you, my handsome friend. and you will look that way till the stars fall from heaven.
it can not be...
give it time. you are like a man who loses a limb and still imagines he feels pain. it will pass. and we must sleep now. i can feel the sun approaching.
you must get into it. it is the only safe place for you when the light comes.
and if i don't?
the sun will destroy the blood I have given you. every tissue, every vein. the fire in this lantern could do that too.
you will get used to killing. just forget about that mortal coil. you will become accustomed to things all too quickly.
do you think so?
i know. it gets cold so fast.
we can live like this? off the blood of animals?
there is nothing in the world now that does not hold some...
fascination...
yes. and I am bored with this prattle --
but we can live without taking human life. it is possible.
anything is possible. but just try it for a week. come into new orleans and let me show you some real sport!
have you ever been caught?
of course not. it is so easy you almost feel sorry for them.
the trick is not to think about it. see that one? the widow st. clair? she had that gorgeous young fop murder her husband. she is perfect for you. go ahead.
but how do you know?
read her thoughts.
i can't.
the dark gift is different for each of us. but one thing is true of everyone. we grow stronger as we go along.
what have you done to me? you have condemned me to hell.
i do not know any hell -
consider yourself lucky. in paris a vampire has to be clever for many reasons. here all one needs is a pair of fangs.
paris? you came from paris?
as did the one who made me.
tell me about him. you must have lernt something from him! it had to happen for you as it did for me!
i learnt absolutely nothing. i was not give a choice, remember?
but you must know something about the meaning of it all, you must know where we come from, why we...
they know about us. they see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
come the new orleans then. there is an opera on tonight. a real french opera! we can dine in splendour!
i respect life, do not you see? for each and every human life i have respect.
respect me a little then. I am the only life you know.
you fool, what have you done?
what you would not do. it is almost sunrise. it will be the sun or the fire. you said they can kill me. the sun or the fire!
where are we?
where do you think, my idiot friend? we are in a nice filthy cemetery. does this make you happy? is this fitting and proper enough?
we belong in hell.
and what if there is no hell, or they do not want us there? ever think of that?
you loved yvette...
can a vampire feel love?
you loved your wife, surely.
i was human then. might as well ask can an angel feel love. both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. though whether angels take as long to learn it as i, i will never know.
what, no flowery speeches? about what a monster i am? what a vulgar fiend?
I am not interested in you. you disgust me. I am interested in my own nature and know i can not trust you to tell me the truth about me.
what do you imagine you are louis?
i do not pretend to know.
do not you understand, louis, that you alone of all creatures can see death with impunity... you alone under the rising moon can strike like the hand of god.
lestat, she is alive!!!!
vampires are killers. predators, who is all seeing eyes were meant to give them detachment.
the girl, lestat -
i know. let her alone.
why do you do this lestat?
i like to do it. i enjoy it. take you aesthete's taste to purer things. kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! for now doubt, you are a killer louis. ah!
lestat - finish this -
you finish her - if you feel so much -
unless i make her one of us...
no!!!
then you kill her!!!!!
my god... to think you... are all i have to learn from...
in the old world, they called it the dark gift, louis. and i gave it to you.
pain is terrible for you. you feel it like no other creature because you are a vampire. you do not want it to go on.
no...
do what it is in your nature to do. and you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
oh god lestat. i felt peace. i felt an end to the craving.
that and more.
evil is a point of view. god kills, indiscriminately, and so shall we. for no creatures under god are as we are, none so like him as ourselves.
is god merciless? greedy and cruel?
ah, but we have even more in common with our creator. come, i am like a mother tonight. i want a child.
she is here, your wounded one.
what are you saying?
you need company, louis. more congenial than mine...
lestat!
you remember how you wanted her, the taste of her -
i did not want to kill her.
do not worry, louis, you are conscience is clear. you left her alive.
claudia, claudia, listen to me. you are ill, my precious and I am going to give you what you need to get well.
lestat, what do you mean?
i want more.
what have you done?
more.
yes, cherie, of course you want more. and I will show you how to get it. you drink from morals, my beauty, but from me? never again.
you are the devil! you are the instrument of satan!
that is enough, cherie. stop before the heart stops.
i want some more.
it is bet in the beginning, lest the death takes you down with it. yes, that is it. my child. my beloved child.
your mama's left you with us. she wants you to be happy.
you are the devil! you are the instrument of satan!
shhhh! do you want to frighten our little daughter?
I am not your daughter.
yes you are, my dearest. you are mine and louis' daughter. you see louis was going to leave us. he was going to go away. but now he is not. he is going to stay and make you happy.
shall we go on?
he did it to make you stay with him!
perhaps. he knew me. he knew i would love her more than the waking world. but there was more to it than that. perhaps in the end he did it -- to show me that he could. for he lavished affection on her, there was no doubt about that. life was very different with madame claudia, as you can imagine...
claudia, claudia, will you never learn? who will we get now to finish your dress? a little practicality, cherie...
she would sleep in my coffin, daily, curl her child's fingers round my hair as she dreamt of i know not what...
how did you learn to write, claudia?
the way i learn everything. by watching you.
but you never let me see you kill, louis.
lestat taught you all you need to know about that.
infant death, he calls me. sweet daughter death. you know what he calls you? merciful death.
he jests.
why does he call you that?
hush, claudia do not talk about such things. show me your book.
claudia! you did that?
sit still. it is not finished -
why always on this night?
what night? what do you mean?
you always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
i did not realise.
is this my birthday?
some of these are so old and tattered. you should throw them away.
i have. or there would be twice as many.
but you are the fairest by far.
you dress me like a doll. you make my hair like a doll. why?
you want me to be a doll forever?
claudia - do not -
why not?
which of you did it? which of you made me the way i am?
what you are? you would be something other than you are?
and if i cut my hair again?
it will grow back again!
but it was not always so! i had a mother once! and louis - he had a wife! he was mortal the same as she! and so was i!
you made us what we are, did not you?
stop her louis!
did you do it to me????
why yours alone? tell me how it was done!!!!
be glad i made you what you are! you would be dead not if i hadn't.
we are immortal. you have always known that.
tell me why...you've got to tell me...
you see the old woman? that will never happen to you. you will never grow old. you will never die.
and it means something else too, does not it? i shall never, ever grow up.
you... fed on me?
and he found me with you. i ran, sickened at what I would done. then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. i tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. and have been every night hereafter.
you both did it?
i took your life. he gave you another one.
but why did you tell her?
how could i not? she had to know.
and did you lose her? did she go?
where would she have gone? she was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. and i had made her that...
but now's the time to end it, louis. now's the time to leave him.
he will never let us go.
what is it now? you irritate me! your very presence irritates me!
does it?
yes. and I will tell you something else! I have met someone who will make a better vampire than both of you.
is that supposed to frighten me?
you are spoilt because you are an only child. you need a brother. or i do. I am weary of you both.
i suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
not you my dear.
you are a liar. but you upset my plans.
what plans?
i came to make peace with you, even if you are the father of lies. i want things to be as they were.
stop pestering me then!
oh, lestat. i must do more than that. I have brought a present for you.
then i hope its a beautiful woman with endowments you will never possess.
oh, claudia, you have outdone yourself. where did you find them?
drunk on brandy wine. a thimblefull. i thought of you when i saw them.
we forgive each other then?
absinthe? you gave then absinthe?
no. laudanum.
laudanum!
yes. it killed them, unfortunately. but it keeps the blood warm.
do not louis --
louis, put me in my coffin...
I will put you in your coffin. forever.
claudia! do not do this thing!!!
louis, louis, i gave you the gift --- help me ---
lestat. oh, god forgive us.
do not mock me, louis. help me.
he is dead, claudia, dead.
the one good lesson he taught me, louis. never drink from the dead.
should we burn him? bury him? what would he have liked, louis?
do not mock, claudia...
the swamp...
in europe, louis. we shall meet our own kind. find the one who made him. learn what it means.
and suppose the one who made him knows nothing and the vampire who made him knows nothing, and it goes back, nothing proceeding from nothing, until there is nothing! and we must live with the knowledge that there is no knowledge.
he belongs with those reptiles, louis. he deserved to die.
then maybe so do we. every night of our lives. he was my brother. my maker. he gave me this life, whatever it is.
i did it for us, louis. so we could be free.
louis, look at me.
i can't. go away from me.
you never talked to me like that - in all these years.
and you never cried -
i can not bear it when you do - i would die rather than lose you louis. i would die the way he died.
hush, claudia, hush now my dear -
tell me you do not hate me louis. i did it for you -
what was that?
the workmen must have a trunk - do not stop, cherie -
it can not be -
it is! take the back stairwell -
the ship is sailing wihout us!
not yet.
did he die in the fire?
he was dead to us. we were free. that was all that mattered.
you found nothing?
peasant rumours, superstitions about garlic, crosses, stakes in the hear, all that - how do you say again? bull shit. but one of our kind? not a whisper.
no vampires in transylvania? no count dracula?
fictions, my friend. the vulgar fictions of a demented irishman... so we repaired to paris...
how do i look?
still my beautiful child.
a beautiful child! is that what you still think i am?
yes...
you want me to be your daughter forever, do not you?
yes.
well tell me, papa. what was it like making love?
you do not remember? or you never knew.
it was something hurries...and seldom savoured... something acute that was quickly lost. it was the pale shadow of killing.
but how will i ever know, louis?
or her, or her - or any of them?
claudia, you torture yourself.
they are ducklings, that will grow into swans. whereas i must be the duckling forever.
you are more beautiful than any of them.
are they my kind louis? dolls never change either.
you are neither, claudia. now stop this --
you know her?
yes. should i take her, louis? among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
come, claudia...
but this can not be real. this is nonsense.
nonsense all right. but something tell me it is going to be the strangest nonsense we have ever seen.
mortals, mortals everywhere. and lots of drops to drink.
they are here. i know they are. listen for something that does not make a sound.
they use no paint. and the audience think it is paint.
how devilishly clever.
she is no vampire.
no. she is frightened. she does not know where she is.
this is no performance.
and no one knows but us...
this is monstrous!
yes, and very beautiful.
I have seen enough of this! i loathe it!
be still!
monstrous.
yes, and very beautiful.
your lips, they did not move.
they did, but too fast for you to see them. no magic, just grace and speed.
disappointing, is not it? to come so far and find so little. jaded ingenues, amusing themselves with make- believe...
we had feared we were the only ones...
but how did you come into existence?
you do not want to answer... two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.
are you the leader of tis group?
if there were a leader, i would be the one.
so you have the answers...
ah! you have questions?
what are we?
nothing if not vampires...
who made us what we are?
surely you know the one who made you...
but the one who made him, who made the one who made him, the source of all this evil...
that is a picture, nothing more.
you mean we are not children of satan?
no.
i understand. i saw you in the theatre, your suffering, your sympathy for that girl. i saw you with the boy. you die when you kill, you feel you deserve to die and you stint on nothing. but does that make you evil? or, since you comprehend what you call goodness, does it not make you good?
then there is nothing.
perhaps...
and perhaps this is the only real evil left...
then god does not exist...
i have not spoken to him...
and no vampire here has discourse with god or the devil?
none that I have ever known. i know nothing of god or the devil, i have never seen a vision nor learnt a secret that would damn or save my soul. and as far as i know, after four hundred years i am the oldest living vampire in the world.
my god... so it is as i always feared. nothing, leading to nothing.
you fell too much. so much you make me feel...
the one who made you should have told you this. the one who left the old world for the new...
he knew nothing. he just did not care.
knew? you mean he is...
i lothe them! i can not stand the sight of them! stupid bourgeois parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I have searched for them the world over and i despise them!
what danger?
i can feel it from them! they want to know who made us, what became of him. they have their rules, their idiotic rules!
do you think i would let them harm you?
no, you would not, louis. danger hold you to me.
love holds you to me. and we are in danger, not you.
love?
you would leave me for armand if he beckoned you.
never.
he wants you as you want him. he is been waiting for you. he wants you for a companion. he bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
that is not so.
do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? when he put me in that trance...
so you felt it too!
let him go, he said. let him go.
he can protect us, claudia.
you really believe that?
i was waiting for you...
listen to me.
claudia is dear to me. my... daughter.
your lover.
no, my beloved, my child.
if you say so. you are innocent.
I am not innocent. but I am afraid. she feels she is in danger from the others.
she is.
but why?
i could give you reasons. her silence. her youth. it is forbidden to make so young, so helpless, that cannot survive on its own.
then blame the one who made her...
did you kill this vampire who made you both? is that why you will not say his name? santiago thinks you did.
we want no quarrel with him.
it is already begun. if you want to save her, send her away.
then i leave too.
so soon? without any of those answers you so longed for?
you said there were none.
but you asked the wrong questions. do you know how few vampires have the stamina for immortality? how quickly they perish of their own will.
we can do that?
you would never give up life. if the world were reduced to one empty cell, on fragile candle, you stay alive and study it. you see too clearly. you see too much.
that is what the one who made me said.
how he must have loved you.
and the vampires of the theatre?
like moths around the candle of the age. decadent, useless. they can not reflect anything. but you do. you reflect its broken heart.
are these not the answers you came for?
yes... my god...
a vampire with a human soul. an immortal with a mortal's passion. you are beautiful, my friend. lestat must have wept when he made you --
lestat! you knew lestat!
yes i knew him. knew him well enough not to mourn his passing.
you have not the vaguest conception under god of what you ask!
au contraire, monsieur, i have.
how do we seem to you? do you think us beautiful, magical, our white skin, our fierce eyes? drink, you ask me! have you any idea of the thing you will become?
your evil is that you cannot be evil! and i will suffer for it no longer!
do not make me, claudia! i cannot do it!
yet you could do it to me! snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! could not you have waited? six more years and i would have had that shape! and now you weep! you have not tears enough for what you have done to me.
oh god! i love you still, that is the torment of it. but you know i must leave you louis...
yes...
and who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?
you promise to care for her then?
yes...
and you know what you ask for?
yes.
what do you think she is, madeleine? a doll?
a child who can not die...
and the child who did die?
my daughter...
look at the gaslight. do not tke your eyes off it. you will be drained to the point of death, but you must stay alive. do you hear me?
yes!
she is dying. it happened to you too, but your child's mind can not remember.
but if she dies...
it is only mortal death.
bear me no ill will, my love. we are now even.
what do you mean?
what died tonight inside that room was not that woman. it will take her many nights to die, perhaps yeaars. what has died in that room tonight is the last vestige in me of what was human.
no... you come back to me louis...
are you mad????
where is she? where is claudia?
follow me - that way - through my cell -
not without claudia. where is she?
i can not save her.
you can not believe I would leave without her. armand! you must save her! you have no choice.
louis, i can not save her. i will only risk losing you -
you will come home with me louis? fro a little while... until i am myself again.
claudia!!!
i could not prevent it.
i do not believe you. i do not have to read your soul to know that you lie.
louis, they cannot be brought back. there are some things that are impossible, even for me.
you let them do it.
you held sway over them. they feared you. you wanted it to happen.
louis, i swear i did not.
i understand you only too well. you let them do it, as i let lestat turn a child into a demon. as i let her rip lestat's heart to pieces! well i am no longer that passive fool that has spun evil from evil till the web traps the one who made it. your melancholy spirit of this century! i know what i must do. and i warn you - you saved me tonight, so i return the favour - do not go near your cell in the theatre des vampires again.
you did not even warm them, did you?
no.
and yet you knew what i would o.
i knew. i rescued you, did not i? from the terrible dawn.
you were their leader. they trusted you.
you made me see their failings, louis. you made me look at them with your eyes.
your melancholy eyes...
what a pair we are. we deserve each other, do not we?
we are a pair, and that is what counts.
lestat escaped the fire!
he had not even been there. and all those years i thought he was dead.
I am so glad you are here louis... I have dreamed of your coming...
do not try to speak... it is alright...
i did not mean to let them do it... that santiago, he tricked me...
that is all past, lestat.
yes. past... she should never have been one of us...
still beautiful louis. you always were the strong one.
do not fear me, lestat. i bring you no harm.
you have come back to me, louis? you have come again to me?
it is only a siren...
i can not bear it louis! the machines out there, that fly and that roar! and such lights! they make the night brighter than the day!
and they frighten you?
you know i love the dark. but there is no dark anymore.
it is false light, lestat. it can not harm you...
if you stayed with me louis, i could venture out... little by little... become the old lestat.
i have to go now lestat...
you remember how i was, louis.. the vampire lestat...
yes. i remember...
i tried to tell you louis... that night in paris... when i first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, louis... not even you.
i tried...
and the more you tried, the more i wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. and how you suffered... i need your forgiveness, louis.
you have it...
no... it can not end like that...
but it has. there is no more to tell.
but you talk about passion, about longing, about things I will never know in my life! it is still inside you, in every syllable you speak! and then you tell me it ends like that? just empty?
it is over, I am telling you...
you need a new passion, louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you have told, you do not understand yourself.
is this what you want? you ask me for this after all I have told you?
if i could see what you have seen, feel what you have felt i would not let it end like this! you need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it will not end like this...
dear god. I have failed again, have not i?
no...
do not say anymore. the reels are still turning. i have but one chance to show you the meaning of what I have said.
