newspaperman?
wants to know who the heir is.
hang up.
sorry, mac, i can't. yeah, mac. sure, but i am not the attorney
hang up.
mr. cedar is, and i have not seen him in two days.  listen, cedar, we have got to do something about the newspapers.
I am not interested in the newspapers.
but it is a great story. somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
yes, i know. my first concern is to locate the lucky man. when i do, it is your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
it is okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in.
thank heaven.
better wire him right away, john.
I will do no such thing. I am going there myself. you are going with me too, anderson - and you too, cobb.
yes?
make three reservations on the first train out to mandrake falls, vermont.
where?
mandrake falls.  m-a-n
that is pretty.
are you sure this is the town he lives in?
good morning.
morning, neighbors. morning.
i say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of longfellow deeds?
deeds?
yes.
yes, sir. yes, indeedy. everyone knows deeds.
yes, i
we would like to get in touch with him. it is very important.
who is that?
deeds! who do you think I am talking about?
oh, yes - deeds. fine fellow. very democratic. you will not have no trouble at all. talk to anybody.
i guess we would better try somebody else.
no, we won't! the next time that jumping jack comes out, I will straddle him while you ask him your questions.
oh, will you come in please, gentlemen?
is mr. deeds in?
no - he is over to the park arranging for the bazaar, so's to raise money for the fire engine.  mal, you shoulda knowed he was in the park.
come in, please. come in. can i get you a cup of tea?
no, thanks.
sit down. sure i could not get you a glass of lemonade or something?
that is very kind of you. are you related to him?
no, I am his housekeeper.
well, we would like to find out something about him. what does he do for a living?
he and jim mason own the tallow works. but that is not where he makes his money. he makes most of it from his poetry.
who are they?
i do not know.
mr. longfellow deeds?
yes.
how do you do.
how do you do.
I am john cedar - of the new york firm of cedar, cedar, cedar and budington.
new mouthpiece. been waiting two weeks for this. kids keep swiping them all the time. they use 'em for bean shooters.  what can i do for you gentlemen?
you gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
I would like to ask you a few questions.
all right.
mr. deeds, are you the son of dr. joseph and mary deeds?
yes.
are your parents living?
why, no.
mr. deeds, does the name of martin w. semple mean anything to you?
not much. he is an uncle of mine, i think. i never saw him, but my mother's name was semple, you know.
well, he passed on. he was killed in a motor accident in italy.
he was? gee, that is too bad. if there is anything i can do to
how about lunch? are the gentlemen going to stay - or not?
of course they are going to stay.  she is got some fresh orange layer cake. you know, with the thick stuff on the top?  sure, they do not want to go to the hotel.
perhaps you did not hear what i said, mr. deeds! the whole semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000!
oh, yes, i heard you all right. $20,000,000. that is quite a lot, is not it?
oh, it will do in a pinch.
yes, indeed. i wonder why he left me all that money? i do not need it.
mr. cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
buffer?
yeah. a glorified doormat.
yes. you see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. the world's full of pests. then there is the newspapers to handle. one must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
cedar, cedar, cedar and budington. funny, i can not think of a rhyme for budington.
why should you?
well, whenever i run across a funny name, i always like to poke around for a rhyme. do not you?
nah.
I have got one for cobb
"there once was a man named cobb, who kept semple away from the mob. came the turn of the tide and semple - he died - and now poor cobb's out of a job!"
sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
huh?
I have gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
oh, i do not mean that. I am sure I am going to need your help.
oh, that is different if it is just poetry.
are you a married man, mr. deeds?
who - me? no.
no, he is too fussy for that. that is what is the matter with him. there are lots of nice girls right here in mandrake falls who are dying to be married
do not pay any attention to her.
he is got a lot of foolish notions - about saving a lady in distress.
now you keep out of this!
saving a lady in distress, eh? well, i suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young.  incidentally, we would better get started. you will have to pack.
what for?
you are going to new york with us.
when?
this afternoon - at four o'clock.
i do not think we have got any suitcases.
well, we could borrow a couple from mrs. simpson. you know, she went to niagara falls last year.
I am kind of nervous. I have never been away from mandrake falls in my life. kind of like to see grant's tomb, though.
i can understand that.  we will take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  congratulations, mr. deeds. you are one of the richest men in the country. we will see you later.  goodbye and thank you.
see you later, kid.
hear what he said? you know how much twenty million is?
i do not care how much it is. you sit right there and eat your lunch. you have not touched a thing.
i can not find him.
you can't?
i looked everywhere. i even went to his house. it is locked up.
look!
what?
that tuba player!
have a drink?
no, thanks.
will you have a cigar?
no, thank you.
i would not worry if i were you. of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you will have a good deal of help. so do not worry. leave everything to me.
oh, i was not worried about that.
no?
i was wondering where they are going to get another tuba player for the band.
we have got nothing to worry about. he is as naive as a child.
john
close that door.  will you get mrs. cedar on the phone, please?
come on, john. what happened?
the smartest thing i ever did was to make that trip.
i know, budington. we can not afford to have the books investigated right now. you must have said that a thousand times already.
but what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh
well, it has not happened yet - has it?
but a half million dollars! my goodness, where are we going to get
will you stop worrying! it was i who got old man semple to turn everything over to us, was not it? and who got the power of attorney from him ! all right, and I will get it again!  I will take it easy. those books'll never leave this office.
look, i can do it!
what is gotten into you, babe? i remember the time when you would blast this town wide open before you would let cobb get away with a thing like this.
oh, he is not getting away with anything.
listen, babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have
can i have a month's vacation?
with pay!
with pay!
uh-huh.
leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow.
now you are talking, babe. I will keep the whole front page open. what are you going to do?
have lunch.
it is merely a suggestion. i do not wish to press the point, mr. deeds, but if you will give me your power of attorney we will take care of everything. it will save you a lot of petty annoyances. every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. strangest kind of people. salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. i have not had a minute to myself. have not seen grant's tomb yet.
well, you see, your uncle did not bother with that sort of thing. he left everything to us. he traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. you should do the same thing, mr. deeds.
besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
yes. that is to say
well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
oh - nothing. no extra charge.
that involves a lot of extra work, does not it?
yes, but that is an added service a firm like cedar, cedar, cedar and budington usually donates.
budington. funny, i can not think of a rhyme for budington yet.
the gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. they are getting a trifle impatient, sir.
they are? i forgot all about them.  what do you think they want?
well, your uncle was chairman of the board of directors. they probably expect you to carry on.
I will tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you will be right down.
thanks  oh, did you send that telegram to jim mason?
jim mason?  oh, yeah. yeah. no, i did not send it. I have got it written out, though. here it is.  "arthur's been with the tallow works too long. stop. do not think we should fire him. longfellow."
fine. send it right away. i do not want him to fire arthur.
oh, sure. sure. we do not want to fire arthur.
he was the last baby my father delivered, arthur was.
i think you ought to give this matter some thought, mr. deeds.
huh?
i mean, about the power of attorney.
oh, yes. yes, i will.
why not? who is he?
a lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate.  tell him to see me at my office.
well, if he has a claim, we would better see him.  send him in.
he is capable of causing you a lot of trouble, mr. deeds.
how can he make any trouble for me? i have not done anything.
mrs. semple?
yes. your uncle's common-law wife. she has a legal claim on the estate.
i leave it to you, mr. deeds. can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
what kind of wife did you say she was?
common-law wife. on top of that, there is a child.
a child? my uncle's?
yes, sir.
that is awful. the poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
I am glad to see you are willing to be reasonable, mr. deeds.
if she was his wife, she should have all the money. that is only fair. i do not want a penny of it.
you would better get right down there. that opera mob is about to break into the mad song from "lucia."[2]
oh, i do not want to keep them waiting any longer. they are important people.  i wish you would go along with me, cobb. they are all strangers to me.
well, what about it, mr. deeds?
you will excuse me, will not you? I will be right back.
gee, I am busy. did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
uh-huh.
that is funny. why is that?
why do mice go where there is cheese?[3]
I am chairman?
oh yes, of course - you have just been elected.
I am chairman.
wait a minute. what does the chairman do?
why, the chairman presides at the meetings.
that is what i thought. if you do not mind, I am rather interested in the treasurer's report. I would like to hear it.
you see, mr. deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit.
it isn't? what is it conducted for?
why, it is an artistic institution
we own an opera house, do not we?
we provide opera.
but you charge. i mean, you sell tickets?
that is impossible. the opera has never paid.
well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
the wrong kind! there is not any wrong or right kind. opera is opera!
i guess it is. but i personally would not care to be head of a business that kept losing money. that would not be common sense. incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from?
well, we were rather expecting it to come from you.
me?!
naturally.
excuse me, gentlemen, there is nothing natural about that .
now, where were we?
you see, mr. deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
why not?
because it just is not a business, that is all!
well, maybe it is not to you, but it certainly is a business to me, if i have to make up a loss of $180,000. if it is losing that much money, there must be something wrong. maybe you charge too much. maybe you are selling bad merchandise. maybe lots of things. i do not know. you see, i expect to do a lot of good with that money. and i can not afford to put it into anything that i do not look into. that is my decision for the time being, gentlemen. goodbye, and thank you for making me chairman.
sorry to keep you waiting so long. those opera people are funny. they wanted me to put up $180,000.
what about it, mr. deeds?
why, i turned them down, naturally.
no, i mean - about my client.
oh - we will have to do something about the common wife.
tails tonight, sir?
what - tails?  why, that is a monkey suit![5] do you want people to laugh at me?  i never wore one of those things in my life.
yes, sir.
of course, we do not want to appear greedy, mr. deeds.
huh?
i say we do not want to appear greedy.
oh. that.
what do you think you are doing?
why, I am assisting you, sir.
get up from there. i do not want anybody holding the ends of my pants. get up from there!
yes, sir.
imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
mrs. semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
and do not ever get down on your knees again, understand?
no, sir.
excuse me. what did you say?
mrs. semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
one-third? that is about $7,000,000 is not it?
well, we did not expect that much. I am sure i can get her to settle quietly for one million.
you are making a mistake, mr. deeds.
oh no, I am not. i do not like your face. besides, there is something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I am surprised that mr. cedar, who is supposed to be a smart man, could not see through that.
now wait a minute, buddy
there is one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. when the servant comes in, mr. hallor, I am going to ask him to show you to the door. many people do not know where it is.
no use in getting tough. that will get you nowhere, mr. deeds.  you know, we have got letters.
will you show mr. hallor to the front door?
yes, sir.
i can not hold out on you any longer. lamb bites wolf.  beautiful.
only common sense.
i can not hold out any longer either, mr. deeds.  being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
you are not my attorney yet, mr. cedar. not till i find out what is on your mind. suppose you get the books straightened out quick so i can have a look at them.
yes, of course, if you wish. but you must be prepared. this sort of thing will be daily routine.  if it becomes annoying, you let me know. goodbye, mr. deeds. goodbye, sir.
well, how about tonight? what would you like in the way of entertainment?
entertainment?
your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. how would you like yours? dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
what are you talking about?
women! ever heard of 'em?
oh.
name your poison and I will supply it.
some other time, cobb. some other time.
okay, you are the boss.  when your blood begins to boil, yell out. I will be seeing you!
he talks about women as if they were cattle.
every man to his taste, sir.
tell me, walter, are all those stories i hear about my uncle true?
well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
twenty! what did he do with them?
that was something i was never able to find out, sir.
no. do not ever want to go out without telling us.
who are you?
yeah, mr. cobb said stick to your tail no matter what.
that is very nice of mr. cobb - but i do not want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
that is going to be fun.
some people like it.
put that away, slug!  at your service!
i got a trunk in that room. will you get it out for me?
certainly.
i suppose it is going to be the same old thing.
i tell you that dame's nuts.
right.
you fainted.
oh, did i? I am sorry . . .
no, thank you. I will be all right.
look, this is my house. I would like to
oh, no, really - I will be all right.
what happened?
well, i guess i walked too much. I have been looking for a job all day. i found one, too. i start tomorrow.  you have been awfully kind. thank you very much.
come on, come on!
hurry up!
feel better now?
mmm, it tastes so good. mr. deeds, i do not know how i can ever thank you.
tell me more about yourself.
well, i guess I have told you almost everything there is to tell. my folks live in a small town near hartford. I am down here alone trying to make a living.  oh, I am really just a nobody.
oh, that was so lovely. thank you.
you were a lady in distress, were not you?
what?
oh - uh - nothing.
huh? on, no. nobody important.
be sure and point 'em out to me, will not you?
uh-huh.
I am a writer myself, you know.
uh-huh.
i write poetry.
uh-huh.
you have been having quite an exciting time here, have not you?  all those meetings and business deals and society people - have not you been having fun?
no. that is, i did not  until i met you. i like talking to you, though  imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
brookfield just came in.
oh, the poet? where?
over at that big round table. the one that looks like a poodle.
look - there is brookfield, the poet.
really?
no - i do not want it, thank you.
why, you must drink! all poets drink!
well, i do not know. i
mr. morrow, over there, for instance, just dashes them off.
yes. have you any peculiar characteristics when you are creating?
well, i play the tuba.
no.
you mean to tell me you do not carry a pocketful around with you?
look, he is temperamental.
yeah, what if i am? what about it?
there is just one thing more. if it were not for miss dawson being here with me, I would probably bump your heads together.
oh, i do not mind.
say fellow, you neglected me - and i feel very put out.  look, sock it right there, will you? lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard.
that is all right. i got it off my chest.
the difference between them and me is i know when I have been a skunk. you take me to the nearest news- stand and I will eat a pack of your postcards raw. raw!
oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. pal, you have added ten years to my life!  a poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! delicious!  you are my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
thanks, but miss dawson and i are going out to see the sights.
fine, fine. swell, you just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I would like to reciprocate. listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet  thanks - and I will show you sights that you have never seen before.
I would kind of like to see grant's tomb - and the statue of liberty.
well, you will not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you will be leaning against the leaning tower of pisa - you will mount mt. everest. I will show you the pyramids and all the little pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
binge?
yes. i mean the real mccoy. listen, you play saloon with me, and I will introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in new york. we will go on a twister that will make omar the soused philosopher of persia[7] look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet.
that ought to be fun.
fun?  say, listen, I will take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever.  boy! boy! my headpiece!
cinderella man! that is sensational, babe! sensational!
it took some high-powered acting, believe me.
did it?
i was the world's sweetest ingenue.
is he really that big a sap?
he is the original. there are no carbon copies of that one.
cinderella man! babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that will stick to him the rest of his life. can you imagine cobb's face when he reads this?
if we could sell tickets, we would make a fortune.
how did you get the picture?
had the boys follow us.
marvelous!  "at two of the clock this morning, mr. deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. when asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'i just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he would ask for a cup of coffee.'"  beautiful! what happened after that?
i do not know. i had to duck to get the story out. he was so far along he never even missed me.
when're you going to see him again?
tonight, maybe.  I will phone him at noon.  oh, my lunch hour. I am a stenographer, you know. mary dawson.
you are a genius, babe - a genius!
i even moved into mabel dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy cobb might start looking around.
good! good!  stay there. do not show your face down here. I will tell everybody you are on your vacation. they will never know where the stories are coming from. stick close to him, babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. we will have the other papers crazy.  babe, i could kiss you!
oh, no. no. our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
sure.
with pay!  she is out the door.
you will get it, babe. you will get it.
mr. deeds - mr. deeds, sir - you really must get up. it is late!
you are walter, are not you?
yes, sir.
i just wanted to make sure.
yes, sir.
what is that?
a prairie oyster, sir.[10]
prairie? oysters?
yes, sir. it makes the head feel smaller.
oh. oh!  has miss dawson called yet?
miss dawson, sir? no, sir. no miss dawson has called, sir.
she was a lady in distress. she would not let me help her. got a lot of pride. i like that.
oh, i do too, sir.
I would better call her up and apologize. i do not remember taking her home last night.
I would venture to say, sir, you do not remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
what do you mean? i remember everything!  hand me my pants - i wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
you have no pants, sir.
you came home last night - without them.
i did what!
as a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. you were in your - uh - shorts. yes, sir.
oh, do not be silly, walter. i could not walk around in the streets without any clothes. I would be arrested.
that is what the two policemen said, sir.
what two policemen?
the ones who brought you home, sir. they said you and another gentleman kept walking up and down the streets, shouting: "back to nature! clothes are a blight on civilization! back to nature!"
please!
but how will i put on the slipper, sir?
yes, sir. i beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
looking for?
you kept searching me last night, sir. going through my pockets. you said you were looking for a rhyme for budington.
better bring me some coffee, walter.
very good, sir.  oh, i beg pardon. a telegram came for you, sir.  I will get you some black coffee, sir.
did you see all this stuff in the papers?
arthur wants to quit!
arthur! who is arthur?
he is the shipping clerk at the tallow works. wants a $2 raise - or he will quit.
what do i care about arthur! did you see this stuff in the paper? how did it get in there? what did you do last night? who were you talking to?
and what did you do to those bodyguards? they quit this morning. said you locked them up.
oh, they insisted on following me.
what do you think bodyguards are for?
what do they mean by this - "cinderella man!"
are those stories true?
i do not remember. "cinderella man!" what do they mean by that?
they would call you anything if you gave them half a chance. they have got you down as a sap.
i think I will go down and punch this editor on the nose.
no, you don't! get this clear: socking people is no solution for anything.
sometimes it is the only solution.
not editors. take my word for it. not editors!
if they are going to poke fun at me, I am going to
listen. listen, longfellow. you have got brains, kid. you will get along swell if you will only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. do not talk to anybody! these newshounds are out gunning for you.
but what about this "cinderella man"?
that is my job. I will take care of that. I will keep that stuff out of the papers - if you will help me. but i can not do anything if you go around talking to people. will you promise me to be careful from now on?
yes, i guess I will have to.
thank you.  if you feel the building rock, it will be me blasting into this editor.
cobb's right. i must not talk to anybody.
miss dawson on the phone, sir.
who? miss dawson?
yes, sir.
fine. I will talk to her. give me the phone, quick. she is the only one I am going to talk to from now on.
it is awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
i enjoy it.
the aquarium was swell. if i lived in new york, I would go there every day. I will bet you do.
well, I would like to - but i have a job to think of.
it do not look as though we are going to get any pictures tonight.
babe ought to get him drunk again.
sure. i met you.
oh. what is happening about the opera?
oh, that - well, we had another meeting. i told them I would go on being chairman if
i told 'em I would play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
what did they say?
gosh, you look pretty tonight.
what did they say?
huh?  oh. they said i was crazy. said i wanted to run it like a grocery store.
what are they going to do?
do you always wear your hair like that?
have you seen the papers?
uh-huh.
that is what i like about you. you think about a man's feelings. I would like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose that is writing that stuff
would you like to walk the rest of the way? it is so nice out.
yes.
yeah, let's.
there you are. grant's tomb. i hope you are not disappointed.
it is wonderful.
to most people, it is an awful letdown.
huh?
i say, to most people it is a washout.
that depends on what they see.
now, what do you see?
me?  oh, i see a small ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. i see thousands of marching men. i see general lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and i can see the beginning of a new nation, like abraham lincoln said. and i can see that ohio boy being inaugurated as president  things like that can only happen in a country like america.
do not want to be critical, john, but here it is
yes, i know. a week's gone by and we have not got the power of attorney yet!
yes, but you said
i do not care what i said. i can not strangle him, can i!
relatives of old man semple.
they keep insisting they should have some nuisance value.
nuisance value?
they say if it had not been for deeds, they would have gotten all the money.
nuisance value.  maybe they have! maybe they have! maybe they have!  mr. and mrs. semple, please. how do you do?
there is times square.
you can almost spit on it, can not you?
why do not you try?
you are worried about those articles they are writing about you, are not you?
I am not worrying any more. i suppose they will go on writing them till they get tired. you do not believe all that stuff, do you?
oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
yeah, i guess so. what puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. why do not they try liking each other once in a while?
here's a nice place.
yeah. anyway, there are not any photographers around.
you know, you said something to me when you first met me that I have thought about a great deal.
what is that?
you said i was a lady in distress.
oh, that
what did you mean by that?
nothing
no. are you?
no.
you do not go out with girls very much, do you?
i haven't.
why not?
oh, i do not know.
you must have met a lot of swell society girls since you have been here. do not you like them?
i have not met anybody here that i like, particularly. they all seem to have the st. vitus dance.[12]  except you, of course.  people here are funny. they work so hard at living - they forget how to live  last night, after i left you, i was walking along and looking at the tall buildings and i got to thinking about what thoreau said. they created a lot of grand palaces here - but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them.
I would rather have mandrake falls.
I am from a small town too, you know.
really?
probably as small as mandrake falls.
gosh! what do you know about that!
I have often thought about going back.
you have?
oh, yes. i used to have a lot of fun there when i was a little girl. i used to love to go fishing with my father. that is funny. he was a lot like you, my father was. talked like you, too. sometimes he would let me hold the line while he smoked - and we would just sit there for hours. and after awhile, for no reason, I would go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. he never said very much but once i remember him saying: "no matter what happens, honey, do not complain."
he sounds like a person worth while knowing.
he played in the town band, too.
he did? i play the tuba
yeah, i know.
what did he play?
the drums. he taught me to play some.
he did?
yes. i can do "swanee river." would you like to hear me?
sure!
oh, i suppose you could do better.
sure. i can sing "humoresque."
"humoresque"? I will bet you do not even know how it goes.
sure. look! you sing it over again, and I will do "humoresque" with you.
it had better be good.
i wonder if they would want to make it a quartet.
shhh!
what is the matter, hon?
nothing.
what is up, babe? something is eating you.
no. it is nothing.
my unfailing instinct tells me something is gone wrong with the stew.
do not be ridiculous.
you have not gotten very far, have you? that is where you were an hour ago. come on, let's knock off and go down to joe's. the gang's waiting for us.
i can not write it, mabel! i do not know what is the matter with me.
could not sleep. kinda wanted to talk to you. do you mind?
no - not at all. i could not sleep either.
i wanted to thank you again for going out with me.  huh? well, i do not know what I would do without you. you have made up for all the fakes that I have met.
well, that is very nice. thank you.
you know what I have been doing since i got home? been working on a poem.  it is about you.  sometimes it is kinda hard for me to say things - so i write 'em.
I would like to read it some time.
good night.
mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he is the grandest thing alive. i can not make him out.
uh-huh.
I am crucifying him.
people have been crucified before.
why? why do we have to do it?
you started out to be a successful newspaper woman, did not you?
yeah, then what?
search me. ask the gypsies.
here's a guy that is wholesome and fresh. to us he looks like a freak. you know what he told me tonight? he said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
the guy's balmy.
is he? yeah, i thought so, too. i tried to laugh, but i couldn't. it stuck in my throat.
aw, cut it out, will you? you will get me thinking about charlie again.
he is got goodness, mabel. do you know what that is?
huh?
no - of course you don't. we have forgotten. we are too busy being smart-alecks.  too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
madame pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
who?
madame pomponi. she says everything is all set for the reception.
what do you mean by coming in here when I am playing?
but she is on the telephone
get out.  the evil finger's on you. get out!
hey, did you hear that?
what, sir?
why, that is an echo, sir!
you try it.
me, sir?
yeah.
you try it.
me, sir?
you are a fool, babe.
i just could not stand seeing him again.
running away is no solution.
what will i tell him if he calls up?
tell him i had to leave suddenly. i got a job in china - some place.
you are acting like a school girl.
what else can i do? keeping this up is no good. he is bound to find out sometime.  at least i can save him that .
yeah. mac threw cobb out again.
boy, was he burning.
just one little drink - and then we are ready to shoot.
just a minute. no, you don't.
we are not going out tonight.
you are mabel - her sister - are not you?
huh? oh, yes - yes, of course. her sister. yes, I have been her sister for a long time.
is she home?
yeah. what?
is mary home?
why there she is!  of course she is home.  stupid of me . . .
hello.
i did not think you could come with the party and everything.
oh, i would not let them stop me from seeing you. so i threw them out!
you threw them out!
you mean  by the neck or something?
sure. they got on my nerves, so i threw 'em out.
i do not mind though. i had a lot of fun doing it.
would you like to go for a walk?
yes, if it is not too late.
I will get my hat.
nice day out - er, nice night - was not it? - is not it?
yes, lovely. we have had a lot of nice weather lately.
it would be a nice night to go for a walk, do not you think?
oh yes, i think it would be a swell night to go for a walk. a nice long one.
ready?
gosh, she looks better every time i see her.
thank you.
goodnight. do not worry. i will not keep her out late.
thank you so much. good night.
ow! my foot's asleep!
come on - let's go!
the reason why i wanted to take a walk, mary, is 'cause i wanted to talk to you.
let's just walk, okay?
all right.
mary, I am going home.
are you? when?
in a day or so, i think.
i do not blame you.
do you mind if i talk to you, mary? you do not have to pay any attention to me.
no, i do not mind.
all my life, I have wanted somebody to talk to. back in mandrake falls, i always used to talk to a girl.
a girl?
oh, an imaginary one. i used to hike a lot through the woods and I would always take this girl with me so i could talk to her. I would show her my pet trees and things. sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
well, here we are again.
yes, here we are again.  good night.
mary - i - excuse me
would you like to read it? it is to you.
yes, of course.
what is bothering you, huh?
last night he proposed to me.
proposed to you! you mean he asked you to marry him?
yes.
why, babe - that is terrific!  "cinderella man woos mystery girl! who is the mysterious girl that"
print one line of that, and I will blow your place up!
sorry, babe. sorry. it would have made a swell story. i just got carried away. that is too bad. so he proposed to you, huh?  what a twist! you set out to nail him - and he
yeah. funny twist, is not it?
say, you have not gone and fallen for that mug, have you?
what are you going to do?
I am going to tell him the truth.
tell him you are babe bennett? tell him you have been making a stooge out of him?
I am having lunch with him today. he expects an answer. it is going to be pretty.
you are crazy! you can not do that!
he will probably kick me right down the stairs. i only hope he does.
I will put you on another job. you need never see him again, eh?
that is the rub.
oh, as bad as that, huh?
telling him is the long shot - I am going to take it.
how is it going? okay?
yes, quite all right. thank you, sir.
gold, eh?
yes, sir.
fourteen carat?
yes, sir.
is that the best you have got?
oh, yes sir.
those flowers are too high. will not be able to see her.  get a smaller bowl, will you?
a smaller bowl of flowers.
stuff, sir?
that goo. that stuff that tastes like soap.
oh, yes, sir. here it is, sir. the pate de fois gras, sir.
yeah, that is fine. have a lot of it because she likes it.
yes, sir.
sit over there, will you?
me sir?
yes.
how is this, sir?
perfect! perfect!
i wish you luck, sir.
thank you. now do not touch a thing. leave everything as it is.
yes, sir. what is it, sir? anything happened3
anything happened? I have got to get dressed! i can not meet her like this!
but she is not due for an hour, sir.
an hour? what is an hour! you know how time flies, walter. my tie? get it.
yes, sir. very good, sir. here it is right here, sir. there, sir.
just as i suspected, wise guy! i do not mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
will you tell the gentleman I am not in?
mary dawson, huh? mary dawson, my eye. that dame took you for a sleigh ride that new york will laugh about for years. she is the slickest, two- timing, double-crossing
she is the star reporter on the mail. every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. she is the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "cinderella man." you have been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
shut up!
this is for you , mac. the names of all the headwaiters in town. you can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
aw, listen babe, i can not let you quit now. you are not going through with this thing, are you?
it is for you. in a couple weeks you will get the itch so bad, you will be working for nothing.
hello . . .
hello, mary?
oh, hello darling.
pack my things, walter. I am going home.
yes, sir.
you should not be running away like this. what is going to happen to the estate?
they can have the estate.
you can not come up here!
let me go! i wanna see him!
he is not home, i tell you!
i wanna see that guy!
we will send for the police!
let me go!
let him alone.
let me alone!  if you know what is good for you - you will let me get this off my chest!  how did you feel feeding doughnuts to a horse?  get a kick out of it, huh? got a big laugh?  did you ever think of feeding doughnuts to human beings! no!
shall i call the police, sir?
no!  what do you want!!
yeah - that is all that is worrying you. what do i want?  a chance to feed a wife and kids! I am a farmer. a job! that is what i want!
a farmer, eh! you are a moocher, that is what you are! i would not believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! you are a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
sure - everybody's a moocher to you. a mongrel dog eating out of a garbage pail is a moocher to you!
are you married?
yes, sir.
any children?
no, no children.
all right, mr. dodsworth. i think you will qualify.  take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
thank you very much.
next, please.
here's the order for the plows. we got a good price on them.
that is fine. thanks. I will look 'em over later.
oh, mr. deeds
my wife wanted me to tell you she  she prays for you every night.
well, thanks, i - uh  how do you do? what is your name?
charlie, we are off! papers all set?
all set.
okay, then. go to it.  and, charlie
yeah?
find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
okay.
what is your name?
christian svenson.
farmer?
yes, ma'am.
where is your farm?
south dakota north.
south dakota - north?
south dakota - but on the top.
oh. oh!
what about your knocking off for lunch?
not hungry. i want to get through this work in a hurry, and then i want to go home. what price did you get on those trucks?
come on, come on. what are you trying to do, kid? keel over? you have not been out of this house in two weeks.
well, maybe i will have a sandwich.  do you mind waiting a few minutes?
cobb! get lunch for the rest of them.
what? there must be 2000 of them out there.
well, that does not make 'em any less hungry.
okay, santa claus. 2000 lunches.
miss bennett please!
this is outrageous!
it is obviously a frameup! they are trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
your honor!
thank you, your honor. are you employed by the morning mail?
no!
you are under oath, miss bennett. i ask you again - are you employed by the morning mail?
no! i resigned last week!
were you given an assignment to follow the activities of longfellow deeds?
yes.
did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
yes!
are these the articles?
yes!
were you present when all these things took place?
yes!
are they true!
no!!
but they did take place?
they are colored! just to make him look silly!
and you saw them happen?
yes, but i
that is all, miss bennett.
it is not all! I would like to explain
that is all, miss bennett. that is all.
the falkner sisters are rather timid, your honor, and wish to be together. if the court pleases, i will only have one of them testify.
yes! yes! let's get on with it.
since he was born.
yes. elsie taggart was the midwife.
he was a seven-months baby.
most every day.
sometimes twice.
must we have the echo?
suppose you just answer, miss jane. now, will you tell the court what everybody at home thinks of longfellow deeds?
they think he is pixilated.
oh yes, pixilated.
he is what?
what was that you said he was?
pixilated.
uh-huh.
he walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
sometimes he whistles.
and sings.
for no reason, i guess. he always does it. we always run into the house when we see him coming.
never can tell what he is going to do.
he sure is pixilated.
oh, yes - he is pixilated all right.
you remember, dr. fosdick, in my last book there are some very fine examples.
uh-huh.
especially, the one of the young nobleman, you remember?
oh, yes. yes, of course dr. von holler. very interesting.
it reminds me very much of this one. nicht wahr?
ja.
it takes so long to detect them  because their mood changes so often and so quickly. now, your honor, may i show you? may i use the chart?
oh, thank you!
your honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. i object.
your honor, this is absurd. the woman's obviously in love with him.
what is that got to do with it?
well, you are in love with him, are not you?
what is that got to do with it?
you are , are not you?
yes!!!
your honor
yes?
I would like to get in my two cents' worth.
take the stand!
proceed.
well, i do not know where to begin. there is been so many things said about me that i
a what?
an o-filler. you fill in all the spaces in the o's, with your pencil.  i was watching you.
mr. deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
oh, yes. yes. about my throwing those people out of my house. mrs. pomponi told the truth. i did throw them out because i did not want the party in the first place. i did not invite anybody. mrs. pomponi did all that. they just came to see what kind of a freak the "cinderella man" was. i do not know how people like that are supposed to act, your honor, but if that pomponi woman is an example, I will stick to simple folks. she just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. if i were a friend of hers, I would have her examined.
your honor, i object.
proceed.
now about the falkner sisters. that is kind of funny. i mean about mr. cedar going all the way to mandrake falls to bring them here. do you mind if i talk to them?
not at all.
why, you own it, longfellow.
yes, you own it.
why, you have always been pixilated, longfellow.
always.
why, everybody in mandrake falls in pixilated - except us.
uh-huh.
oh, yes.
yes, indeedy.
mr. deeds, you have not yet touched upon a most important thing. this rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. it is, to say the least, most uncommon.
oh yes, i was getting to that, your honor.
please, mr. cedar!  proceed.
personally, i do not know what mr. cedar's raving about. from what i can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
it is a lie!
mr. cedar!
mr. deeds is drawing on his warped imagination!
you will please permit mr. deeds to finish.
but your honor
mr. cedar!
anything else, mr. deeds?
no.  yes. there is just one more thing I would like to get off my chest before i finish.
proceed.
thank you, your honor.
he is still pixilated.
he sure is.
