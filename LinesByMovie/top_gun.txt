I have got a six strobe.  i think he is locked on us.
it is a mig 21. they do not have radar missiles!
let's hope you are right!
what is he doing?
he is pissing me off!
can not shake him.
what is mig one doing?
maintaining course. straight for mustang.
that is missile lock!
he better be kidding!
lordy!  eyeball to asshole. hope nobody burps!
I will lock on them, cougar.  gotcha covered, do not nobody move.
I am up here too, maverick.
roger, cougar.  okay boys, pull out with your hands up and nobody'll get hurt.
we are locked on mig one. why does not he disengage?
these guys are getting on my nerves.
ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
speaking of feet, fuel's down to 4.0.  we are going to get them wet unless we find a sonoco station.
cougar, this is maverick.  I am getting hungry, let's head for the barn. ...cougar, where are you?
hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... instead of just us.
you.
help me with this one, I am really screwed up.
bring it left. bring it left, you are high.
this is crazy!
what is?
wait! hell!..something's wrong!
what?  what is it?
were upside down!
you are crazy. we are level.
can not you feel it? I am hanging in my straps!
you are not. we are level. look at the instruments, we are okay!
they must be broken. I am hanging in my straps! we are inverted!
we are not! trust me! we are okay.
i...forgot something.
what the hell you doing?
helping him in.
what makes you think we can get back in?  we do not have the fuel for this. maverick just get me to him.
I am pulling up.
no! now we are inverted!
what are you doing here?
everybody's got to be somewhere. ..now we are right with you. you are inverted.  roll it, cougar.
we are on vapor, cougar, you got to put it down.
it is crazy, man. instruments are crazy. we are going to have to eject.
tell him, will you tell him? our instruments are okay.
maverick.
yeah, cougar?
you better not be ragging me... if you are flying upside down...
no joke, cougar. on the level. even i would not do that to you.
I am upside down. i know it. I am going to eject.
look at the weather! they will never find us! we are near out of fuel. put it down.
cougar, you are on the ball.
okay... okay. but if i land this thing upside down. and i live. I will have your butt!
you will have mine, cougar. it will be where your head used to be.
do not worry. I will talk to him.
don't.
he is a good pilot.
i talked a man back once. three months later, we lost him. it is his decision. only he knows.
he is the best you have. he is going top gun!
was.
was going.  now you are.
me?
well, he is going  and he needs someone to fly the plane.
skipper, you can not do this!
i did not do it, he did it himself. something about a wife and kid. the fact is, he is lost it. he knows it. i know it. you were up there, you know it, too. goose give him a break, skipper. it was raining snakes up there. he will be alright, soon as all the gorillas go home...
but, skipper, cougar's been picked for top gun...he's the best of the best!
well, you will just have to make do with him .
mav's a great flyer but....
he is a hell of a flyer. in fact, he is so damn good he might have been picked for top gun himself. except for one thing.  he just can not seem to follow orders!
you just did an incredibly brave thing! what you should have done was land your plane. you do not own that plane, the taxpayers do. i should ream you out for it. but it just does not work with you. you are a hell of a flyer. you are maybe ...too good. you never really stepped in it yet. so this is your chance. I am going to send you up against the best. they are better than you. maybe they will knock that shine off your eagle and you will see, finally, where discipline and teamwork fit it. maverick has not really heard anything but topgun. he snaps out of it.
sir?
that is all. tell me about the mig some other time...
yes sir!
yes sir..
the wings..
well... what   is   it?
sir. you are going to give me a warning, sir!
yes sir. i do, sir.
well?
sir. i was going mach point one five.
one sixth the speed of sound!
yes sir.
lieutenant... what do you... usually fly?
f-14's sir.
tomcats?
yes sir!
lieutenant... is there... a russian attack?
no sir! but you have to be ready.
yes, sergeant?
remember one thing.
sir?
outside of this gate... i...am top gun.
yes sir!
what are you doing?
nothing...that's mcgown...that's singer, is not it? goose turn around, pay attention. what are you doing?
considering the company you are in, that is a pretty arrogant attitude.
yes sir.
i like that in a fighter pilot.  it is okay to be confident. you have to think you are king kong to want to try to land on carriers. just keep in mind the other component of success...teamwork.
a plaque?
it is not the plaque. the winner can get assigned here as instructor. he gets to fight every day.
keller, black lion squadron. i knew him at pensacola. he is damn good.
is there anybody in the navy you do not know?
gotta keep track of the competition.
slider -- they let you into top gun? if you are among the best in the navy, i tremble for the security of this country.
why goose, whose butt did you kiss to get here?
the list is long, but distinguished.
so's my johnson.
this is maverick.
so I have heard.
who is your pilot?
tom kazansky.
no shit. the iceman....
mister to you.
you think you can stay up with us.
i think, yeah, we will show you a thing or two.
this is evan mitchell, he steers the thing.
so i heard. steers it pretty close. sorry to hear about cougar. he was a good man.
what was that?
flaming hooker. sort of an institution around here. or maybe this is the institution, i forget which. it is the house drink. it will warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.
you ever done this before?
what, been drunk? sure! plenty!
how was it?
could use a dash more jet fuel.
that is kazanski.
no shit! that why they call him ice?
nope. it is the way he flies - ice cold. no mistakes. wears you down. after enough time, you just get bored and frustrated, you do something stupid, and he is got you.
why do you all have such funny names?
you got to have a call sign that is just your own...never changes...you have to recognize it immediately. then, if someone shouts "wolf, break left!"..you react right away.
why do they call you wolf?
hey mav, this is sally. she does not believe a word i say. tell her I am married, will you?
yeah, he is married--but then again, he,s not dead.
well, i do not know. that depends.
on what?
well, it does not just happen, you got to do something famous.
like what?
oh...i'll think of something.
figured it out yet?
figured out what?
who is the best.
nope.
need a hint?
i think i can work it out on my own.
you like to work alone. I have heard that about you.
I have heard of you, too. you were in 124 with bargamian.
and you were with cougar. he was my roommate in flight school.
it is not cougar's place. it is ours.
what do you think it was? was it that mig contact that did it?
did what?
got you here.
we are here because we are the best flyers in the wing. not because of some mig encounter.
what do these guys think, i made cougar quit?
pay no attention to it. they are just trying to rattle you. it is all psychological. sit down..and drink.
I will bet!
uhhh...anything i can do for you? she laughs again, does not know what it is...could be chemical, but she is instinctively attracted.
yeah. hold this. it might be safer.
now i know why all the girls come here. they know how horny you guys get. but this...is ridiculous.
it is not that.
it isn't?
well, it is. it is that, too.
that is a big comfort to me.
i could be, too.
how so?
save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
and on to a bigger one with you?
yeah, most likely.
was there ever a girl who did not like fighter pilots?
i heard of one once.
can i walk you out?she turns back to him, a smile.
I am with someone.
i thought he would never leave.
yeow!
everybody's got to be somewhere.
what if captain dawson had come with me?
it would have been really embarrassing!
how did you know this was my car?
simple deduction. it is fast. it is pretty. sleek and stylish...it's your color...matches your lipstick.
that is all!
and i asked someone. charlie you think you are pretty smart.
i beg your pardon.
no, i beg yours. but i do not think you are right on that.
why not?
i saw one.
you saw a mig 21?
i saw a mig do a 4 g negative dive.
where did you see that?
it is classified.
it is what?
it is classified. like hollywood says, i could tell you, but then I would have to kill you.
lieutenant, i have a top secret clearance. the pentagon sees to it that i know more than you.
not in this case. charlie  you saw a mig push negative 4g?
yes, ma'am.
where were you?
on his six.
he was in a 4g negative dive and you were on his six?
yes, ma'am, at first. then i was directly above him.
if you were directly above him, how did you see him?
i was inverted.
two.
two miles.
two meters.
the what?
you know. the finger.
it never came up.
you let me make a fool of myself.
you seemed determined to do that anyway.. why did not you tell me you were a famous mig insulter? maverick would it have made a difference?
no.
what would?
you know, I am assigned to this school. i see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. your attention is flattering, but not really productive. why do not you keep your mind on flying.
maverick... where did you get that call sign?
ahhh... runs in the family, sir.
you are father was marvin mitchell..
yes sir.
a good man. good flyer.
I have lost him -- where is he?
on your six -- coming hard. four hundred. losing airspeed! he is on your six and closing fast! hard left! hard left!
great move. great
he should have had me. goose take it down. let's bug out of here. call for a draw.
we did it!
look, ma, top of the world!
ahhh...a little high on the left, do not you think?
right.
it is a victory roll.
i would not call it victory.  it is more like...self immolation.
hi...hi there. how ya doing in there?  mav... ahhh...you know, at one point i did want a navy career.
come on, relax...
you see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... oh, no, i think that was johnson, air boss of the kitty hawk!
come on, we beat an instructor. how many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
just once, if they take your plane away.
nice. always a good idea to show up your instructors. he nods toward jester, glaring at them from his a4. goose indicates the backseat of the tomcat.
hey, see any controls back there?  and anyway...we beat the son of a bitch!
you won?!!!
did not everybody?
no, we...got our butts kicked.
thirty seconds. that is all it took to blow us out of the sky.
that is not what i heard.
we won! ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
below the hard deck does not count. you guys are the second team, are not you?
i had him in view. i was peeling over the egg, into a dive. he saw me when i moved in for the kill. there was not any danger...
is that how you remember it?
the hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
just below ten thousand.
but you continued to fight.
why?
we were not below for more than ten seconds. there was no danger. i had the shot. i took it.
the rules of engagement are not flexible. they exist for your safety. you will obey them. is that clear?
i do not know what to tell you, skip.
tell me one thing.
he is seat of the pants... completely unpredictable -- nothing by the book. all over the sky. but i do not know, skip, he is really got something.
yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class.   "maverick!"
man, you guys gooned it. your laser butts are scattered across kansas.
come on. i died enough for one night.
what would you say, too fast...too quick...
and far too aggressive.
it is combat. every second counts.
well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. who can match you move for move. then you have got something.  I am sorry.
for what?
that stuff about the mig. i was out of line.
apology acknowledged.
is that all? charlie what else do you want?
um. you.
there you go with those moves again.
too aggressive?
i do not mix with the boys. i work here. let's keep it professional.
I am special.
yes. I will give you that!
give me a break, I am asking you out.
i can't.
i thought there was something... that night in the club...
lieutenant...
evan... or maverick.
maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
the what?
some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
what are you talking about?
you turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
I am not your foe. charlie and if he is harmless, you disengage.
harmless!
uh hum.
what if he is not?
you have to shoot him down....if he is smart, he will turn away before that happens.
and probably never again. it is nothing personal. it is just...i know a lot of pilots. maybe I am immune...
do not worry, I am a new strain. and i do not give up. everything I have ever wanted I have had to work like hell for. well, how about it?
how about what?
how about anything, anything you want to do.
hard to argue with that, is not it...
a date... coffee... a drink...a walk in the park.
what about the plane?
what plane.
most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. maverick well, get used to it.
used to what?
I am different.
I am starting to sense that now.
let's make it at eight.
make what?
anything.
okay, anything. just...go. I have got to work.
why did you do that?

it dies. we live.
you are an animal.
that is true. what are you?
i do not enjoy watching things suffer.
no!
it is not suffering anymore.
you are horrible
you are not, cause you eat frozen meatballs?    things die. every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. every time you eat, something had to die.
you do not have to kill it.
somebody does. it is more honest this way. you do your own dirty work.
you ever think about killing another human being?
about as much as they think about killing me.
does it bother you?
they know the rules... that is the deal. that is why you are up there. it is him or me. that is the price of admission.  it bothers you, why? you are part of it.   everybody dies. most people do not get to die for something.
you know what really scares me? living too long. losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. and my brains...sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime tv.
you do not believe any of this. you do not think you will ever die.
that is it, of course. when I am up there and doing it, I am cheating it every second. I am subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I am skating the edge of it.
winston churchill.
what he said..."there's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
all you have got is one life. i guess it is worth about the same to every body. you ever see an old woman after her husband has died? and the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead...  when you are in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. that is your whole future. that is as far as it goes. but imagine what those seconds are worth.
what if you kill yourself? think of everything you will miss. maverick there is lots of stuff i do not know about...  fine wine... great art... the opera. i guess if i live long enough, I will get to it. if i don't, I will never miss it.
are you really that brave?
i watched my mother die. cancer. she had a long time to think about it. they say you reach an agreement with death. come to accept the fact that pretty soon you will not be here. i did not see that. she... was very brave...braver than i am. you go up there, there is not time to think. if you make a mistake, you are just a smudge on the ground. simplifies funeral arrangements.
it is just as i thought.
what?
you are totally insane.
thanks very much.  care for some suchi?.
come on, we are next.
what?
come on, i got over six bucks on the line.
come on, come on! it is double or nothing.. we are talking twelve bucks american, here.
I have had enough...for now.
come on.
where?
you want to go ballistic?
i do not know. i do not like being out of control.
i always wanted to fly... ever since i first saw a jet. i wanted to fly jets, then i wanted f-14's, then i wanted to fly off carriers, then i wanted top gun.
and now?
and now i want you.
you always get what you want?
i do not know yet.
i want it understood.
anything.
no fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. by anyone.
why?
I am a professional. you guys are in my line of work.
i was not thinking. i just did it.
big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
what the hell is this?
do not chew it, you will not have it that long. easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
i was a victim of circumstance.
they should have warned you about that one.
she is kinky for flight suits--said that she would never seen so many zippers--played with them all night. the noise alone kept me up.
what did you do?
pulled left, rolled out, underneath.
it is kind of ironic. all you guys have women troubles and i don't.
that is because you do not have any women.
until last night. did you see the moves i was making on that girl at the party?
the girl with the purple fingernails?
that is her--tall hungry woman with fire in her eyes. it was great.
it was bad.
bad?
the girl with the purple fingernails was coogan's sister.
coogan spent half the night looking for her. he said he was gonna kill the son-of-a-bitch who ruined his sister.
i did not ruin her.
you did not help.
no, really. she came ruined!... ya think he knows it was me?
hear about ice?
what now?
he won again.
something bothering you?
nothing. let's just go fight.
morning, coogan.
how is it goin', coog?
stay with him! tighten your turn!
bogey at three of the clock high! nose on!
snapshot..missed him..
engaging the other guy. wood, you are on your own.
just cover wood, maverick. mutual support, man!
I am going to take him, goose.
do not be greedy. stay with wood.
i want him!
what what are you doing? we are cover!
wood's okay. i want viper.
walked right into it.
not only that, but zorro got your wingman. nice going.
twenty years' experience, i could not shake you. you may be a great flyer. i mean that.
i lost.
of course you did. i said a great flyer, not a smart one. you fly reckless. great instincts. no discipline. that ambush today, you followed your emotions instead of your wingman. of course you got killed...and well deserved to. it was a really stupid mistake. in battle, it gets people killed.
i can take care of myself.
talent is no holy shield. von richtofen was killed by a farm boy. instincts are not enough. do it our way. we have worked these things out. the good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive.    why do you have to do everything the hard way?
it is my own way. it works for me. i do not care about the rest of that stuff.
then why are you here?
for the same reason you are.
oh, you mean the thrill!
the flying. the fighting.  I would go up there ten times a day to fight. I would win at least nine of them. that is all i want to do. it is what i do best. i am real good.  just give me the jet.
relationships are a bitch, here. it is hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. having a woman here is asking for it.
i guess that is what I am doing, then.
where do you find the time? where do you find the energy. it is tough enough to keep your mind on school. a woman here is a real pain in the...
food...and you...my f-14!
in that order?
well no...inverse order.
I am still second best.
you ever fly an f-14?
i do not fly in anything that does not show movies.
danger?
. yeah!
does not it ever bother you?
why, what is going to happen?
lucky charm.
what do you take me for? it is a navy cross.
just good luck.
where did you get it.
pawn shop. what is to eat?
engaging bandit 12 o'clock.
shit!!
come off right--come off high--i'm in--i'll engage.
stay where you are. he is mine. I am engaged. I am in.
get out of there, you are unsafe. get out of there.
fire, or clear out, ice.
get lost!
you got too much nose to tail -- I am coming in.
it is my shot.
come off--come off right. I am on my way in. you go free, I am engaging.
stay out of it. stay out of it, maverick.
you can not shoot him, i can. I am in.
ice, roll off, i can shoot him.
no, no, no, he is mine.
if you can not shoot him, i can.
no, i got him. i can take him.
I am pinned to the panel.
time to go.
i can not eject.
3000 feet. I will do it.
go ahead. i can not reach. 2000 feet!
1000.
let's go. eject.
how do you feel?
all right.
goose is dead.
i know. i was there.
he was...my responsibility--my rio.
my first squadron in vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. ten guys. the first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
...they say you are alright.
I am fine.
this is it, then.
what?
the dark side. the price you pay for all the fun you are having. you knew about it, of course. did not you?
he was a friend of mine. a good guy...great guy. it was my fault.
that is not what i hear.
i was flying...my responsibility.
that is what you get flight pay for.
maybe i should not take it.
why? you act like you did not know one day this would happen.
not to me.
you knew it. you all do. it is part of it. maybe the most important part.
where are we?
where are we? you know where we are. it is called the beach. it is where life first crawled up out of the sea. i come here sometimes... when i feel like crawling back in.
you do not have to do this.
do what, show you a good time?
I am not good company. i should be alone.
i do not think so, but if that is what you want...
no.
what do you want?
i want it back.
what?
yesterday.
you look way out there. out past the date line. west becomes east, all things change. you cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, i forget which.
that is what i want.
of course the line's just imaginary. you can cross it twenty times...nothing really changes.
you do not believe that.
hardly ever.
only when you are depressed. then it passes.
it does.
everything passes. immutable law of the universe.
what do you do when you come here?
i sit. i think. i play games.
what kind of games?
i like to play "reality".
how do you play reality.
it is strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
strip reality! how do you play that?
it is like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  one person says something and if the other one accepts that it is true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
you are crazy.  that is a pretty silly game.
not as silly as some. you know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. that we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
want to play the game?
how does it go?
you say the truth.  go ahead. do not be afraid. you want to win the game, don'tcha?
what truth?
the big one. the one that is most on your mind.
goose is dead.
true.
now?
take something off.
off me or off you?
that is up to you.
what does it mean?
that was not fair. it was a question. penalty round!
you did not mean it. you did not think. you would do anything to take it back.
that is three.
and that is one!
one more.
your watch.
looks like a tie.
who is going to win?
we will say it together. on the count of three...one...two...
what? where are you--hey, where in the hell are you going?
did not ... ahhh...look good.
what do you mean? it does not get to look much better than that?
no. no good.
he just will not engage. he can not do it, skipper. he can not get back on the horse.
it is only been a week. keep sending him up.
I have seen this before.
so have i.
some guys never get it back.
what are you doing?
saving them some paperwork.
since when did you care about paperwork?
if i could fly like you I would have everything i want. if i could fly at all. i can not fly. i can not fly like that. nobody can. whatever it is, you have got it!
not anymore.
so, you are scared--so what? you ever get a good look at me in the back seat, I am goddamn terrified.
you were not going to say goodbye?
i was, later.
long distance? i would not do that to you. I would at least talk to you.
i did not want to see you. i mean, i did...but i didn't..
i know exactly what you mean.
how could you?
I have got a gift just like you do. my gift is i just know what people mean, even if they can not say it. it helps when you are trying to communicate with fighter pilots. like what you just said was "i'm embarrassed, i feel I have done something wrong, that I have failed, and i do not think i can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." that about it?
...something like that.
and I am going to sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until i can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
big talk for someone who is never been shot off her computer.
hey, i never said i was a fighter pilot...i never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. i can find contentment in a good book. i do not have to roar by someone at mach two with my hair on fire. sometimes...i just get happy being with the right man.
i hope you find him.
i think i have... i could be wrong. i have been before. just remember one thing. if you are not top gun, if you are not fighting jets, you are not going to be able to act like a fighter pilot... you are going to have to act like the rest of us. you are going to have to master humility. for you guys, that is the toughest maneuver of all.
skipper, sorry to bother you.
no bother.
i called your house.
my wife's house.
she said you took your kid to the each. every second sunday. zoo or beach or the ballgame. y'have the option... what about me?
we can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "cnc" --course not completed, no explanation required. theoretically, it does not hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
or....
or you can quit.
i do not know...
i did not know either. that is why i told jester to prepare your papers.
it is no disgrace, kid. that spin was hell. it would wreck anyone's confidence. you could be a good pilot again someday...
you think i should quit?!
i did not say that. that is up to you. but i have responsibility for the other guys up there, not just you. they need to know you are all right...that they can depend on you.
sometimes it is luck, but in this case, he earned it... i served with your old man.
i know.
vf 51, the oriskany. you remind me of him. you are just like he was, only better...and worse.
I am nothing like him.
you may not think so, but you are.
he was by the book, all the way.
they waved him off. he thought he knew better. he hit the ramp.
i never heard that.
not something they tell dependents.
it is not true.
how can i go on? i feel so... responsible.
kid, the plain fact is...you are. I am not going to stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. technically, they absolved you. you and i know what really happened. you pushed it. you are responsible and you will always carry that. you know what, I will carry it too. i should have taken you out of that cockpit. i guess I am a hopeless romantic... i always try to find something worthwhile in someone is death. it is no trade-off. it is not one for one. what you learned is not worth his death. it could not be. but maybe there is some value in it. i know it is the first thing I have ever seen that is really gotten to you. now the question is, what will you do with it. if it gets you out of flight status...so you do not kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. that is one good thing. you were an accident waiting to happen.
you think i should not fly.
i did not say that. that is up to you. i think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you will be a better pilot... a better man.
would you take me back? would they?
I will have to think about it. i do not know about them. i do know one thing, we have got a lot invested in you. we would hate to lose it. even more than those other guys, naval aviation needs a very few, very good men.

bandit at seven of the clock low--solo. take him. pull on the goddamn stick, man!

i can not lose him, can you get off a shot?
i got no tone. it might get you.
