why do not you catch a few murderers for a change?
well, you could say that murder was part...

calloway - I am english, not irish.
...expense.
going to find me the real criminal? it sounds like one of your stories.
please be careful, sir. up we come. written anything lately?
take him to sacher's.
it is a military hotel.
I am so glad to have met you, sir. I have read quite a few of your books.
mr. crabbin.
what is it, sergeant?
mr. holly martins, sir.
who?
the author. thought you might be interested.
never heard of him.
oh, he is very goad, sir. I have read quite a few of his books.
have you, sergeant? author - martins. thank you, sergeant.
you do!
yes, cultural re-education section propaganda. very important in a place like this. we do a little show each week. last week we did "hamlet" and the week before we had something...
striptease, sir.
yes, hindu dances, thank you, sergeant. this is the first opportunity we have had of making an american author welcome.
welcome?
I will tell you what, mr. martins. on wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...i thought perhaps you would like to speak.
they would not know me.
nonsense. your novels are very popular here. are not they, sergeant?
very popular, sir.
very popular. are you staying long?
how long can one stay here on this stage money?
listen, mr. martins, if you would agree to be our guest, we would be delighted to have you.
...leaving tomorrow, sir.
excuse me, have you got tooth...
come upstairs a moment.
i know a very good dentist.
i do not need a dentist. somebody hit me, that is all.
it was just a soldier. i was trying to punch his major in the eye.
no, a major, were you really?
heard of harry lime?
I have heard of him, of course, but i did not exactly know him.
i was going to stay with him, but he died thursday.
goodness, that is awkward.
is that what you say to people after death? "goodness that is awkward..."
baron kurtz.
must be some mistake.
yes.
i was a friend of harry lime.
i would very much like to meet you, baron. come around.
austrians are not allowed in your hotel. could not we meet at the mozart cafe?
where?
just around the corner.
how will i know you?
I will carry a copy of one of your books. harry gave it to me.
...this lecture business, you will put me up here a while?
certainly.
seems exciting.
it is, and I am gunning just the same way for your major callaghan.
mr. martins. delighted to meet you. come let's sit down here. ober! zwei. what would you like. tea? coffee?
coffee.
zwei zwartze.
it is wonderful how you keep the tension.
tension? kurtz suspense.
you really liked it?
at the end of every chapter --
we came out of his place like this, and were walking this way. a friend of his called to him from over there. harry went across and from up there came the truck. it was just about here.
here?
...were of you.
what did he say?
...you know and all that.
but he said he died instantaneously.
well, there was only you, and this friend of his. who is he?
a roumanian.
excuse me!
yes, sir.
did you know mr. lime well?
mr. lime - yes.
you remember me? upstairs...
yes, yes, i remember you.
...popescu...
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
what does he say?
...you.
only his doctor, dr. winkel.
not necessarily. she would probably want to help.
what is the good of another post mortem? suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to harry?
will you give me...
...your address?
i live in the russian sector, but you will find me at the casanova club every night. one has to work...
...the best way one can, you know.
what is the name of this girl?
oh, mr. martins, good evening.
good evening mr. crabbin.
thank you.
sit down.
thank you. i enjoyed the play very much.
you were awfully good.
do you understand german?
no, no...oh...excuse me.
but i could follow it fine. perhaps harry told you about me. my name's holly martins.
no, he never told me about his friends. would you like some tea?
well, i saw you at the funeral.
I am so sorry, i did not notice much.
you were in love with him, were not you?
i do not know. how can you know a thing like that afterwards. i do not know anything any more.
oh, american, thank you. i like them.
i was talking to another friend of harry's. a baron kurtz - do you know him?
no.
he has a little dog.
oh, yes, yes.
do not understand what harry saw in a fellow like that.
that was the man that brought me some money when harry died. he said harry had been anxious at the last moment.
he said he remembered me too. seems to show he was not in much pain.
dr. winkel told me that.
dr. winkel? who is he?
the doctor harry used to go to. he was passing just after it happened.
his own doctor?
yes.
were you at the inquest?
yes. they said it was not the driver's fault. harry often said what a careful driver he was.
he was harry's driver?
mmmm.
...at all.
i know. i wondered about it a hundred times, if it really was an accident.
sehen sie da gleich da unter. da unten ist est passiert. passiert - english.
what is he saying?
happened...yes happened right down there.
you saw it?
not saw, heard...heard. i heard the brakes. wham! and i got to the window and saw them carry the body to the other side of the er...er joseph...that's joseph emperor joseph statue.
why did not they bring him in the house?
could he have been conscious?
conscious? cas soll ich auch noch wissen?
oh, er - oh...was he - was he still alive?
er, alive? he could not have been alive, not with his head in the way it was.
i was told that he did not die at once.
ah, er war gleich tot - i mean, sie war gleich tot - brauchen kein angst zu. ein moment...wart ein bissel...wartein bissel. fraulein schmidt!
...give evidence.
who else?
kurtz.
yes.
the roumanian?
yes.
and?
there was a third man - he did not give evidence.
you do not mean that doctor?
no, no. he came late after they carried him to the joseph statue.
i do not know. they did not answer.
i was told there were only two men there.
you gotta tell your story to the police.
police? why police? das ist alles blodsum was sie da sangen. no, no. it is all nonsense; it was an accident.
you do not know it was an accident. you only saw a dead man and three men carry him.
der ami macht mich noch ganz deppert. i should have listened to my wife. she said you were up to no good. gossip.
suppose i take...
fer von mir aus gehen sie zur gansalt aber mich lassen sie aus mit der politzei.
now, hold on.
das hat man davon wenn man freundlich ist mit den auslandern...
i have no evidence. i saw nothing. i said nothing. it is not my business.
well make it your business.
you should not get mixed up in this.
well, if i do find out something, can i look you up again?
why do not you leave this town - go home?
ich weiss nicht.
das mussen sie doch wissen. ich meine ohne grund wird die politzei doch nicht ins hans komme fraulein schmidt, ein schande...
what is she talking about?
the police. they are searching my room. sie mussen doch wissen.
what the devil?
getting around, martins.
oh, pinning things on girls now.
...parents.
yes.
write her out a receipt, paine. give her a receipt for these letters too.
this way, miss.
must you take those?
they will be returned, miss.
they are - private - letters.
that is all right, miss, do not worry. we are used to it - like doctors.
and there was a third man there. i suppose that does not sound peculiar to you.
I am not interested in whether a racketeer like lime was killed by his friends or by accident. the only important thing is that he is dead.
tactful too, are not we, callaghan?
calloway.
must you take those letters? calloway yes, I am afraid so.
they are harry's.
that is the reason.
you will not learn anything from them. they are only love letters. there are not many of them.
they will be returned to you, miss schmidt, as soon as they have been examined.
there is nothing in them.
miss schmidt.
you are not locking her up?
get the next plane.
as soon as i get to the bottom of this, I will get the next plane.
death is at the bottom of everything, martins. leave death to the professionals.
do you mind if i use that line in my next western? you can not chuck me out, my papers are in order.
there you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.
i do not want it.
well, I have got it when you want it, miss.
anything really wrong with your papers?
they are forged.
why?
the russians would claim me. i come from czechoslovakia.
den leuten.
ja, ja, ja.
sayen sie ed our den leuten damit sie es auch wissen.
hier sind fruher fursten ans unt eingeganger. hier hat sogar ein metternich verkehrt...
give her some cigarettes.
das worren nooh zeiten.
oh, what was the name of that doctor? harry's doctor?
dr. winkel.
what do you want to see a doctor for, huh?
a bruised lip.
dr. winkel?
vinkel.
vinkel...you've got quite a collection of er-collection.
yes.
martins.
coming to the point, please.
thank you.
i have guests waiting.
find out?
hear the details.
i can tell you very little. he was run over by a car. he was dead when i arrived.
could he have been at all conscious?
i understand...
...he was. yes, for a short time, while they carried him across the road.
in great pain?
not necessarily.
what is it?
this is forgery. it is very clever.
we are interested in this case. have you arrested the girl?
no, not yet.
please keep this passport to yourself, until i make some inquiries, will you, major?
yes, of course.
thank you.
right. sit down miss schmidt, we will send your letters and things back to you.
and my passport?
you know as much as i do, miss schmidt - you were intimate with lime, were not you?
we loved each other, do you mean that?
do you know this man?
i have never seen him.
joseph harbin...
no.
he works in a military hospital.
no.
it is stupid to lie to me, miss schmidt. I am in a position to help you.
in one of his letters he asked you to telephone - a good friend of his called joseph. he gave you the number of the casanova club. that is where a lot of friends of lime used to go.
it was not important.
you can help us.
what can i tell you but that you have got everything upside down.
hello - mr. martins, we tried to get you at your hotel. we have arranged that lecture for tomorrow.
what about?
on the modern novel - you remember what we arranged and we want you to talk on the crisis of faith.
what is that?
oh, i thought you would know, you are a writer. of course you do. good night, old man.
drink?
whiskey.
harry?
yes. he moved his head, but the rest is good, is not it?
not yet.
but you will.
mr. popescu is here tonight.
the roumanian?
yes. the man who helped carry him.
who are you looking for now?
sssh. don't. don't, please.
silly looking bunch.
mr. popescu - mr. martins.
how do you do.
good evening, miss schmidt. you remember me?
of course.
i helped harry fix her papers, mr. martins...
oh, you did.
not the sort of thing i should confess to a total stranger, but you have to break the rules sometimes. humanity's duty.
cigarette, miss schmidt?
thank you.
keep the packet.
harry...
two double whiskeys. was wunschen sie?
nichts danke. kein.
entschuldigen sie. it was a terrible thing.
i thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
funny?
something wrong.
of course there was. some ice for mr. martins.
that is all you meant?
what else?
was not he at the police inquiry?
he did not want to get involved.
will we never teach these austrians to be good citizens. it was his duty to give the evidence.
what else did he tell you?
that harry was dead before you got him to that statue.
he probably knows a lot more than that. somebody is lying.
not necessarily.
no.
joseph harbin.
joseph harbin? no...no.
yes, it is.
i am not a bad man.
the porter is going to talk to us tonight.
need we go through it all again?
might as well i suppose. are you busy?
just another part I have got to learn.
can i hear you?
in german?
i can try. is it comedy, or tragedy?
comedy. i do not play tragedy.
do i...
well you read this.
gestern bein heurigen...
what is that?
"ein hurigan" - i guess.
h-e-z-t...
oh, let me see. no, no that is not the cue. it means she has to sit down.
tell me about him.
tell you what?
when...what did you do?
oh, we did not make much sense. drank too much. once he tried...
...to steal my girl.
where is she?
oh, that was many years ago.
tell me more.
oh, it is very difficult. you know harry...we did not do...
...and buried him.
anna.
seemed like a good idea.
it is just what he used to say.
well, i did not learn that from him.
if we have to see the porter we would better go.
what is the hurry? can not we talk quietly for a couple of minutes?
i thought you wanted...
a moment ago you said you did not want to see the porter.
we are both in it, harry.
holly.
I am so sorry.
it is all right.
that is harry's place, is not it?
yes.
let's go away.
what is the matter?
let's not get into any more trouble.
wait here.
warscheinlich ist der murder.
they think you did it.
sneak out the other way, and go back to your theatre. I would better not see you again.
what are you going to do?
i wish i knew.
be sensible - tell major calloway.
get me major callaghan on the phone.
oh, mr. martins...
...excuse me.
please hurry up - just get him on the telephone.
do you know his number?
no, i do not know...
...his number.
I will look it up for you.
well, look, is there a car here i can use?
well, yes. i suppose that is what i meant to say.
of course, of course, of course.
zane grey.
oh, that is mr. martins' little joke, of course...
third man.
a novel, mr. martins?
mr. martins...
not when i get interested.
...this time.
yes.
should i make it all fact?
why no, mr. martins.
...mr. martins?
never.
a parrot bit me.
oh, stop behaving like a fool, martins.
I am only a little fool - I am an amateur at it - you are a professional. you have been shaking your cap and bells all over town.
well?
in vienna...
do you see what that means?
are you too busy chasing a few tubes of penicillin to investigate a murder?
that is the racket harry lime organized.
calloway, you have not shown me one shred of evidence.
very good, sir.
you know, paine's one of your devoted readers. he is promised...
...of santa fe."
I would like to visit texas one day, sir.
next, paine.
i would like a word with this orderly harbin.
so would i.
bring him in.
i can't. he disappeared...
...a week ago.
it is more like a mortuary than police headquarters.
...be responsible for you in the streets.
I am not asking you to.
...in the morning.
thank you. excuse me.
...austrian police headquarters.
can i have that woman's passport?
wer ist da?
me.
i thought you were going to go away. are not the police after you?
i do not know.
I am going back home.
why?
what happened to your hand?
a parrot...let it go.
have you seen calloway?
can you imagine a parrot nipping a man?
have you?
...you know.
he told you, did not he?
he is better dead. i know he was mixed up - but not like that.
i knew him for twenty years - at least i thought i knew him. i suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
he liked to laugh.
seventy pounds a tube. he wanted me to write for his great medical charity.
I will put these flowers in water.
...and my lover. he was harry.
well, do not preach wisdom to me. you talk about him as if he had occasional bad manners.
...again.
there is not enough for two laughs.
i followed his shadow until suddenly...
well?...
this is where he vanished.
i see.
i suppose you do not believe me.
no.
look...i tell you, you do not think I am blind, do you?
yes. where were you when you saw him first?
fifty yards right down there.
which side of the road?
i was on that side, the shadow was on that side, and no turnings on either side.
how about the doorway?
i tell you i heard him running ahead of me.
yes, yes, yes, and then he vanished out there, i suppose with a puff of smoke and like a clap of...
now then, miss schmidt, I am not interested in your forged papers - that is purely a russian case. when did you last see lime?
two weeks ago.
i want the truth, miss schmidt. we know he is alive.
it is true then?
joseph harbin's body was found in the coffin.
what did you say? I am sorry...
i said another man was buried in his place.
where is harry?
that is what we want to find out.
I am sorry - i do not seem able to understand anything you say. he is alive now this minute - he is doing something.
miss schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the russian sector... you may as well help us. in a few minutes colonel brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. tell me where lime is.
i do not know.
if you help me, i am prepared to help you. anna martins always said you were a fool...
vienna is a closed city, miss schmidt, he can not get away.
poor harry, i wish he was dead, he would be safe from all of you then.
are you mad?
all right - I am mad. I have seen a ghost...
hello, harry.
well, well, they seem to've been giving you quite some busy time.
listen...
yes.
i want to talk to you.
talk to me?...of course...come on...
listen, harry - i did not believe that...
it is good to see you, holly.
hmm.
she is been arrested.
tough...tough...don't worry, old man, they will not hurt her.
what can i do, old man, I am dead, are not i?
you can help her.
holly...
...exactly who did you tell about me? hmm?
i told the police.
unwise, holly...
and - anna...
did the police believe you?
you do not care anything at all about anna, do you?
well, I have got quite a lot on my mind.
you would not do anything.
what do you want me to do?
you can get somebody else...
do you expect me to give myself up?
why not?
it is far better thing that i do... holly, you and i are not heroes, the world does not make any heroes...
you have got plenty of contacts.
outside of your stories...i've got to be careful.
I am only safe in the russian zone... I am safe as long as they can use me...
as long as they can use you?
i wish i could get rid of this thing.
you told them, did not you?
do not try to be a policeman, old man.
what did you expect me to be - part of your...
part? you can have any part you want, so long as you do not interfere...i have never cut you out of anything yet.
i remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
sure...
have you ever seen any of your victims?
do you know, i do not ever feel comfortable on these sort of things...victims?
it would not work.
we will never get him in the russian zone.
calloway, you expect too much. i know he deserves to hang, you proved your stuff. but twenty years is a long time - do not ask me to tie the rope.
here we are. you will be all right here, miss.
i don't...
thank you, you have been so kind. anna moves down to stand cl of paine.
well, I will be saying good night. good night, miss.
good-bye.
are you going, too?
oh...
...is there?
how did you know i would be here?
...headquarters.
have you been seeing major calloway again?
harry.
I am sorry.
what is on your mind? why did you hide?
hide? can not a fellow have a drink?
here, it will be cold on that train.
i shall be all right.
you send me a wire as soon as you arrive.
what is going to happen? where is harry?
he is safe in the russian zone.
how do you know?
i saw him today.
did he say anything about me - tell me?
oh, the usual things...
there is something wrong. did you tell calloway about meeting harry?
of course i did not tell calloway.
why should he help me like that? the russians will only make trouble for him.
that is his headache.
his.
oh, well.
why are you lying?
we are getting you out of here, are not we?
...quarrel?
if you want to sell your service, I am not willing to be the price... i loved him. you loved him. what good have we done him. look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
calloway!
oh, there you are. come in here, there is not much time.
a girl of spirit.
she is right. it is none of my business.
did not i?
you all did.
do you mind if i drop off somewhere on the way? I have got an appointment, will not take five minutes...
of course.
why do not you come in, too - you are a writer... might interest you.
paine lent me one of your books; "oklahoma kid," i think it was. read a bit of it... think it is pretty good. what made you take up this sort of thing? been doing it for long?
all right, calloway. you win.
i never knew there were snake charmers in texas...
i said you win.
win what?
I will be your dumb decoy duck.
shall i go over there, sir?
no, no. leave them for a while.
...anyway?
from kurtz. they have just been arrested. but harry will not come, he is not a fool.
...this way.
what do you want?
what time is it?
two thirty.
calloway, can not you do something about anna?
I will do what i can, if she will let me.
wait a minute - let me out.
well, there is not much time.
one can not just leave - please.
be sensible, martins.
i have not got a sensible name, calloway.
