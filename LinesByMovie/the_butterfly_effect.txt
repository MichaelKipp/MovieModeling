we are going to be late again.
when did you ever care about getting to school on time?
we are putting up pictures for parent's night.
righty-tighty, lefty-lucy.
thanks. do not worry evan, you will have plenty of time.
darn it!
um... can dad come this time?
you know the answer to that.
can not he come out for one day?
we have been over this a hundred times. it is too dangerous for him.
but lenny said that his dad's coming... and tommy and kayleigh's dad...
all the dads are gonna be there.
i get the point, kiddo. but I am not so bad, am i?
no.
good. because I have been waiting to see your art projects all week and I would feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
mrs. treborn! i need to speak with you!
I am sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I am already late for work --
i was going to show this to the principal, but i wanted to talk to you first.
what is it?
yesterday i had all the children draw pictures of what they wanted to be when they grew up. most of them made drawings of what their parents did, but this...
thank you for showing it to me first. i'll... I will take care of it. can i have the picture?
of course. there is one more thing, mrs. treborn. and i feel bad for mentioning it...
what?
when i asked evan about his drawing, well, he did not remember doing it.
you put the mommy too far away. mrs. boswell has macaroni and glue if you wanna fix it.
you are such a retard!
hey, what did you do that for?
fat little baby, crying for mommy.
can... can... can i have this?
sure. i was gonna make a new one, anyway.
and you say he does not remember any of it?
not according to his teacher. it just got me thinking about jason and what if evan's inherited his father's condition?
hold it, hold it, andrea. let's not jump to conclusions. I will run some preliminary tests, see what we can rule out.
i do not like this place, mom. it is creepy. please can we go? i promise i will not make any more bad pictures!
you will be fine. dr. redfield just wants to give you some tests. you will like him.
hello, evan. it is very nice to meet you.  he is as handsome as his father.
you know my father?
that is why i wanted you to come here, evan. dr. redfield already has a background in memory loss.
my father has a bad memory, too?
just tell me that evan does not have jason's illness...
look, andrea, I am sure he will test negative for brain disorders. but there is something else you can try to monitor his memory.
anything.
a journal. just have him write down everything he does.
why? what for?
it could be extremely useful to jog his memory. see if he remembers anything new the next day. and I will have the test results back in a few days.
these'll bring you luck, crockett.
great. I will see you soon.
what happened?
honey. what were you doing with that?
i... i do not remember.
evan, guess what? dad got a new video camera and we are all going to be in a movie.
i do not think evan gets to be in it --
quit it, tommy. evan gets to be robin hood. I am going to be maid marian, and you are the sheriff of nottingham!
i thought i was the bad guy!
you are, silly. he is a bad sheriff.
we are really going to be in a movie!?
that is right, evan, and you get to be the star.
where am i? what happened? where did we all go?
calm down, kid. stand still.
i was just somewhere else -- how did i get here?
quit acting like some retard or I will call your mother and tell her what a naughty little shit you have been.
kayleigh? what happened?
well, the good news is that the results are negative. I have found no evidence in the way of lesions, hemorrhaging, tumors...
and the bad news?
unfortunately, we have got nothing to work with. it is harder playing detective now.
but you must have something to go on?
if i had to guess, I would say the blackouts are stress related.
but he is seven. what kind of stress can he have?
plenty. who knows? maybe he is got severe coping problems about not having a father. did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
come on, i doubt the answer's that simple.
you would be surprised how often they are.
well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I have been putting it off.
it is worth a shot. i can arrange a controlled meeting. a careful dose of sedatives for jason, some security, you and i monitoring. evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
how soon?...
dad lives here?
not in this wing, actually. no.
now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that is just because of his medicine, okay?
okay.
it is okay. i will not bite. you have seen pictures of me, right?
uh-huh. mom says i have your eyes and your --
tommy, I am bored shitless over here. what is up already?
hold your horses, man. it is here somewhere. i saw it when i was a kid.
we should go soon. if dad catches us smoking down here, we are dead.
so let's go. this place creeps me out.
what did i say about mentioning that bitch?
where the hell are you taking us anyway? just blow something up already.
just blow something up? are you nuts? there is an art to mass destruction. would you just paint the mona lisa? no. besides, we are here already.
here you go, buddy.
what? no frigging way, man. I am not touching that thing.
the hell you aren't. anyone of us does it, you will puss out and narc for sure.
am not going to work this time, buddy. look how small that fuse is! I will get killed.
that should buy you ten minutes at least.
gee, thanks friend.
hurry! let's go! get him up, evan! come on!
what happened?? where are we?!
oh god... what did we do?
shit, lenny. what is happened to you! we have got to get help!
i do not know... i do not remember.
something must have happened! what set him off?
i... i blacked out.
do not try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
now i want you to go back to the time you were in the woods with lenny. think of it like a movie. you can pause, rewind, or slow down any details you wish. understand?
yes.
where are you now?
I am standing next to kayleigh, my hands are over her ears.
are you hurting her?
no, protecting her.
okay. then go a little forward in time. what do you see now?
i see a car.
go on. nothing can hurt you. remember, this is only a movie. you are completely safe.
i can't... the car vanishes and all of a sudden I am on the ground in the woods.
the car does not vanish evan. the movie in your head has broken, that is all. but now I have re-spliced it and i want you to tell me about the car.
it is coming... argh! i can't!
evan wake up, oh please wake up!
nine, ten. and you are awake! open your eyes, dammit!
wipe that sad-assed look off your face before you get us all busted. you see the way evan's mom was looking at you?
I am sorry.
I am sorry kayleigh. this was a bad idea.
you really do not remember anything that happened?
ouch.
I am sorry.
it is not your fault. mrs. kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to lenny.
damn. your dad did this?
i deserve a lot worse.
what are you talking about? what you deserve is a better brother and father. all they do is make you feel like shit.
i can not believe tommy's still pissed at me. he knows I am moving away, right?
he is been acting real strange lately. he will not even look me in the eyes anymore.
duck, here they come.
did your mom say if lenny was... okay?
he must be. they are letting him go, right?
welcome home. thought you might like some fresh air for a change.
hi, lenny.
look what you made me do!
what is wrong with you?!
I am not sure. i might have gotten some stories mixed up. did pavlov condition his dogs to lick his nuts?
typical psych major. a complete wise ass. and how is your project coming? still planning to change the way we humble scientists view memory assimilation?
hey, i got no choice.
get dressed, thumper, you are taking me out for my birthday.
i thought you were a december baby.
this is bigger. seven years to the day. no blackouts.
it is an experiment with flatworms and a maze. you take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he is memorized it. then you put a new flatworm in the maze. he is clueless. banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.
like ozzy.
just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.
that is probably why hannibal lecter's so smart.
so what is the point?
maybe if i can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it will help me understand the complexities of the human brain.
smells like sex in here.
thumper had a busy afternoon.
you are kidding. he is so... big.
most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
yeah. I have been keeping journals since i was seven.
wow... read something.
freeze! no "worm-boy". no "mr. worm," and no "worm-master-general!" once you get a nickname like that you can not shake it. and i do not want everyone thinking I have got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
deal. now read me something.
come on, go on...
it was like tommy was possessed or something. there was a hate in his eyes that i could not really call human.
it did not feel like a dream.
maybe because they never do.  so don juan, you pass out on all your dates?
i could not cut the rope.
yeah, good, what else do you remember?
drop it or I will slit your mother's throat in her sleep.
you really think he wanted to kill you?
all i know is that i might be able to unblock some of my repressed memories.
maybe it went out. should someone check it?
yeah, you do that, lenny.
lenny? come on!
oh my god oh my god...
whoa! did not mean to scare you, evan. just wanted to know how the flatworms project was coming.
oh, fine i guess. it is been kind of crazy lately with my mom coming up, so i haven't...
i know, i know. who can think of worms when your libido's in full swing, right?
just do not drop the ball, okay?
i will not let you down, professor carter.
please, mom. people will talk.
i can not help it. I am just so proud of you. you have got the highest grades in all of your classes.
did da -- jason --- get good grades?
please. he got straight a's without ever touching a book. that was the one area where his memory never failed him.
ma? did he ever say that he figured out a way to recall a lost memory years after he blacked it out for the first time?
why do you ask?
no, it is just weird with him being such a brain and all, i just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he would forgotten.
when he was around your age... almost exactly your age. he said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
i could not tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. you know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
sure...
and then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
what? what could he do?
i never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so i wanted to wear my clothes but mr. miller took his shirt off --
what the fuck are you doing?
shhh! i need quiet for this.
are you stupid or what?
what?
shucks, i dunno. but maybe there is a reason why you have repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!
god, evan! i never thought I would see you again. how've you been?
oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...
no, evan. i do not know. it is been a long time. fill me in.
I am going to state now. things are going okay. i guess. mom's good...
not since we were kids.
I have stopped a hundred times.
so how is tommy?
they kept him in juvy for a few years. now he works over at dale's autobody.
no. i emancipated myself when i was fifteen.
wow. that must have taken some courage.
not if you remember my dad.
could not you have moved in with your mom?
she had a new family. not enough space for me. said i should have moved in with her when we were kids. but... whatever.
actually, kayleigh, the reason i came back to town was to talk to you.
me? are you kidding? why?
remember when i was a kid i had all these blackouts?
of course.
well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and I would kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. it would be a big help.
well, sure. I will try to remember. shoot.
when we were kids. your dad was making a movie. robin hood or something?
what do you want to know, evan?
it is just... did he... what happened in the basement?
it was a long time ago.
i know, but...
is that why you came all the way back? to ask a lot of stupid questions about robin hood?
no, but i think something really bad might have happened to us.
just shut up, evan. you are wasting your breath.
you can not hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.
who are you trying to convince, evan?! you come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? you want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? well fuck you, evan! nothing's going to be all better! okay?! nothing ever gets better!
what time is it?
it is time for you to stand where the hell i told you.
wrong answer, fuckbag. this is the very moment of your reckoning. in the next thirty seconds you are going to open one of two doors. the first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.
what is happened to -- how are you doing that?
it will change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. ultimately, it will lead to her suicide. nice work, daddy.
who -- who are you?
let's just say you are being closely watched, george. your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. sound okay to you, papa?
...yes.
listen close then, fuckbag. you screw up again and i swear I will flat out castrate you.
jesus, kayleigh, you're...  incredible.
mmmm... you give good compliment. clean up and come back to bed.
where... where are my clothes?
those are your clothes, silly.
hey, uh, do not go freaking out on me over this, but do you remember when your dad first got his video camera?
well i remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. why would that freak me out?
i dunno.  just being weird.
whasamatter? lost your rolex?
huh?
fuck off, frat boy.
remember, everyone! only two weeks until your science projects are due.
i still owe you an essay from last week. is there any way i could get an extension?
and you are...?
evan treborn.
the answer's 'no', mr. treborn. now take a seat. the exam's about to begin.
evan, you are hysterical. you study for this?
we will find out soon enough.
me neither.
you are kidding. are these the answers?!
damn, evan, on the d.l.
thanks. wow. hey, i want to do something really special for kayleigh tomorrow. if i said i needed some help from you and the brothers...
I would say blow me. get the pledges to do it.
oh my god, that was good. where did you learn all those new tricks?
so it did not feel... weird?
yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
what do you think it is about us that makes us so perfect? like, looking back, whatever gave you the nerve to sneak out and visit me after i moved away?
as if my dad could have stopped me from seeing you. what is he going to do to me?
i do not understand, where are you taking me?
you will see.
i do not know what to say. it is beautiful.
go on. sit down.
why are you doing all this for me?
simple math. when i woke up this morning and saw your smile... i knew that i wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.
it is my fault. i should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
might'a been nice.  like this is going to do any good. maybe one of the frat guys has a gun.
please, evan. do not even joke. he would not hurt you. he is just trying to scare you away from me.
yeah, right. tell that to crockett.
it is not his fault, evan. you knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
do not give me this oprah-book club bad upbringing shit, because you turned out fine.
my father never laid a hand on me. it is like the prick saved it all up for tommy.
are you okay?
what do you mean?
it is just... you have been acting kinda strange, you know?
like how?
i do not know. you seem... different. you make weird jokes. your accents changed. you do not even walk the same.
i walk differently?
i can not put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. even the dinner tonight. it was beautiful, but...
i know I have been actin strange lately. it is just that... i do not want anything to happen to us.
wait. something is not right. is not that your jacket?
what?
leave us alone you sick fuck!
get this "us" shit. as if i was going to lay a hand on my own sister. you have done nicely for yourself, evan. nice friends, nice life, not to mention you are fucking my sister. not a bad piece of ass if i say so myself.
shut up, tommy!
aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
what the hell are you doing?
it was not enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who did not think i was a piece of shit.
no one thinks you are a piece of shit, tommy.
right, evan. i believe you just said "sick fuck."
evan, stop! you are going to kill him!
he is a fucking maniac!
best not bitch up. wind up someone is luggage that way.
can you protect me?
jesus himself could not make me take on the brotherhood. when they come, just put your mind in another place, man. be somewhere else.
...i spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. he is sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you are patient.
how long will i be in here?
i do not know. these things take time.
how is kayleigh doing? she all right?
i found these. the others are still in storage.
damn it, mom. i told you i need them all!
fine. you will get them, evan. but i think it is far more important to focus on your case right now.
you are religious carlos, you believe that bit about "the lord works in mysterious ways?"
straight up.
because i think he sent me to your cell on purpose. for you to help me.
shit. i knew you were crazy.
i am not bullshitting. jesus speaks to me in my dreams.
so when I am out, i need you to watch my face and hands closely.
you need to see the prison shrink, man.
just tell me if anything weird happens.
weirder than this?
marks, scars, i dunno. anything could happen i guess.
what did you see? what did it look like?
signs of the lord. they just appeared out of nowhere. i thought you were loco!
so you believe me?
i want you to take this, lenny. today's your day of atonement. i know how guilty you feel about that woman and her baby --
evan. stop it. it is not the time.
now's the only time!  today you get a chance to redeem yourself. start over with a clean slate. tabula rasa --
listen to me good, evan...
I will do whatever you want. you do not want me to ever see kayleigh again, fine. just let crockett go. besides, you kill him now and they will stick you in juvy for sure. and i know you would never leave your sister alone with your father.
okay, doc. what is the damage? how much time have i got?
cute, evan.
it is a little complicated. i have not seen results exactly like these before.
are you sure? not even with my father?
actually, these tests were not available twenty years ago.
so what did you find.
this is where we are finding most of the hemorrhaging. the outer lining of the cerebral cortex.
lemme guess. would that be where the memories are stored?
what does that mean for evan?
he is saying it is like forty years worth of new memories have been jammed in my brain since last year. overload city. 'sat about the gist of it, doc?
you knew the whole time, did not you?  when you put the blade in my hand, you knew something big was going to happen. did not you?!
y... yes. i guess i did.
are you okay? you looked like you were somewhere else for a second there.
look, jason, i need some fast answers if I am ever going to fix what I have done.
i was praying this curse would have ended with me.
but it didn't. and now i need info to make things right again and you are the only one who can give it to me.
there is no "right". when you change who people are, you destroy who they were.
who is to say you can not make things better?
you can not play god, son. it must end with me. just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
bullshit. I will send you a postcard when I have made everything perfect again.
just get out, didja?
huh?
nothing. just that my brother did a stint in the pen and he used to eat like that.
i come from a big family.
meant no offense.
none taken. hey, uh, does kayleigh miller still work here?
sorry. never heard of her.
oh, i thought you were my eight o'clock. make it fast, I am expecting someone.
nice to see you, too. can i come in?
so how is tricks? sorry, occupational humor.
i get it. you can drop it now.
oh, I am sorry. does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
no. just that you need to hurt me with it. I have been where you have been.
ha! where is that?
the bottom. when you are just a piece of meat waiting for the next attack.
what is happened to you?
you would not believe me. i mean, people always say, "you would not believe me", but in this case, it is not even worth trying.
I have seen some sickening shit. i do not blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
why is that?
because you're... different.
different? how?
let me ask you a question. just a little one that is been gnawing at me for years.
yeah?
on the bridge. how did you know that tommy had your dog? that was no fucking hunch.
do you remember when i was a kid and i had those blackouts?
you are right, evan, i do not believe you.
i never thought you would. that is why I have never bothered to tell a soul until now, and why i never will again.
I am the only person you have told? that is a great line. does that make other girls swoon? do they actually eat up this bullshit?
i could not give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I am too tired to prove it to you.
oh? there is proof now?
shit. i dunno. how would i know about the twin moles on your inner thigh?
anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
then forget that. how about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
i just thought you should know.
know what?
that i did not leave you there to rot.
there is one major hole in your story.
which is?
there is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that i was in some fuckin' sorority.
sure you do not want your wallet?
do not think I will need it where I am going.
off to change everyone's life again, is that it? maybe this time you will pop up in some mansion while i wind up in tijuana doing the donkey act.
I am over it. whenever i try to help anyone it all turns to shit.
well, do not give up now, slick. you have already done so much for me. hell, why do not you go back in time and save mrs. halpern and her baby. then maybe lenny would not freak out and ruin my family.
get out. both of you.
sorry, dude. just figured it would be okay with you bein' sick and all.
where are we going?
we have to get you to sunnyvale. you are having one of your famous hemorrhages.
stop! take me back!
i did what you said, man! we are pooling our student funds with hillel house and we are going to have an awareness dance.
oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of hava nagila til i puke.
uh, we should be getting to class now.
forget it. what is the point of psych now? tomorrow i could wake up as some dirt farmer in bangladesh.
you know how spiritual he is gotten ever since he saved mrs. halpern and katie.
he saved mrs. halpern? please, the twisted fuck.
is something the matter?
yeah, i think i gotta get these fixed or something.
kayleigh? do you ever think about "us?" i mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
sure, evan, why not? you were the first person i really ever cared about.
i was?
that is why when i was little i never went to live with my mother.
i do not get it.
when my folks split, they gave me and tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. i could not stand my dad, but i knew if i moved to my mom's I would never see you again.
i never knew that. so then you still sometimes think of us... together?
it is crossed my mind from time to time.
and...?
well a lot of things cross my mind. I have always been a fast thinker, ev. i can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. it took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
then you think it might have worked out?
why not? but that is not how things wound up. I am with lenny, lenny's your friend. and there it ends.
lung cancer?
sorry, mrs. t. he is been out of sorts lately.
there must be a way to fix this.
fix?
i just need the entry about the blockbuster. wait, shit, no arms. i never even got the chance to write it.
mom. do not cry. i can change this.
i think I will go check out the chapel.
you're. acting. like your father.
come on, mom. just 'cause dad was my age when he started going crazy does not mean that I am nuts.
how. did you. know that?
you told me that on parents' weekend. remember? wait, that was not me. or you.
just. like. jason.
do not worry. I am going to get you out of here.
are you sure you even packed it?
my mom packed for me. i think she sent everything i ever owned. so we will see.
what do you need it for? i do not get you lately.
duly noted. now I am going to ask you for one last favor.
what?
shhh. i need to concentrate on the blockbuster if I am going to destroy it.
destroy it?
if i had not blown my arms off, mom never woulda started smoking in the first place. now shhhh.
easy does it, evan! do not be a bad boy or I will tell mommy you were naughty.
and I will tell the child protective services about your kiddie porn endeavors. one step closer and I will shove this up your ass!
that is dangerous! you could blow your hands off!
been there, done that.
hey, evan. what is the big rush? we do not meet for another hour.
where are my goddamn books?
books?
my journals! where are they?
think evan. you have invented a disease that does not exist. alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...
but i... i need those books.
you remind me of your father. he always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
photos?
no dances, just tell me.
the hemorrhaging... the neural damage is irreparable. I am frankly surprised he still has use of his motor functions.
