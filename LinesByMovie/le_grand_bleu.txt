well, if it is not the little frenchman!  how is the little frenchman?
fine!
you do not mind if i go instead, do you?
no...
if you did mind, you would tell me, would not you?
roberto?  how long?
six seconds.
you should not dive everyday, papa.
then you should not eat everyday, jacques.
hey!  have you ever seen a mermaid?
no.
why do not you ask me?
what?
where i saw the mermaids?!  why do not you ever ask any question? I am always the one asking the question!  we are sitting here like two stones and I am taking to myself. ask me something, goddamnit!
how did it happen?
the company asked me to extract everything i could from the wreck; so the divers were trying to get at the engine... and then the boat turned over... in the current... and... look, i fucked up!  can you help?
how many are, down there?
ten thousand.
lira?
dollars.
you are going to hold me up at a time like this?
in my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
what does that mean?
enzo, what are you going to do with the money?
have the car painted.
santini will do that for 25 dollars!
then tell him to wax it too.
enzo, really.  what are you going to get?
a rosary for mama, a dress for
yes?
find the frenchman.  find me mayol.
do not you have a heater?
yeah... sure... is this your first trip to peru?
does anybody live to make a second?
a drink to warm up?
yes, thank you.  intravenous if possible.
tea... or whiskey?
... both.  did i just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
would it be out of place to ask what he is doing?
who?
the guy in the halloween suit!
who... who is that?
mayol... jacques mayol.
that is the experiment?  dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
... the truck fell into a very deep crevasse.  we were not able to save the equipment.
I will have to talk to the driver.
in the spring when he melts!
my dear, science is a cruel mistress.
but... how is he going to breathe?
he is not going to breathe.
he is in the fluoroscope now.  listen to his heart.  impressive, huh? the flow of blood is concentrated in the brain and does not even feed the limbs anymore.  it is a phenomena that has only been observed with dolphins... until now.
how long can he stay down?  without breathing?
it depends.  he should come up soon.  unless he is decided to stay for the night.
why is he doing this?
for one thing, it is his job... as for the rest of it, i wish i knew.
should not somebody take him a blanket or something?
coffee might be nice.
will he understand spanish?
his mother's an american.  he spent half of his life in the states. I would try english if i were you.
i recognize you.
we saw each other a little while ago.
in the lake?
no... in the hut.
i changed the lock you son of a bitch!
... sally?
you are back!  hello.  we were burgled.
again?
they got the new t.v.
... and the new stereo.
i hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
yep.  how was your trip...?  help me clean up, okay?
you called the police?
they are going to send detectives.
well?
what?
how was your trip?
nice... very interesting... great!  ... i guess.
okay... who would you meet?
it is his heartbeat.
oh jesus...!  I will make some coffee.  they left the stove.
i thought you said he was peruvian?
have not you been listening?
... since eight of the clock last night...!  you are in love.
do not be a jerk.  there is no such thing as love at first sight.
jacques, my friend, how are you?
enzo...
that is good.  you never would have recognized me, huh?  check out the suit! looking good, no?  you know I am the world champion?
yes, i know.
i dove 315 feet!
great!
they say I am like lazarus.  you know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!
why?
because I am sure you are dying to beat me.
i do not want to be in any competition... i dive because i like to, not to beat a record... do not you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
no.  all you need is to want to be the best.
you are the best, enzo!
that is too easy!  every time i beat a record there is always some dumbshit asking me:  "d'you know that french guy, mayol?  he is supposed to be very good!  too bad he does not compete." so, you are going to come with me to taormina! first, because you are my friend and second, because you do not have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure.  ... I will see you there...
this is good work... unfortunately it is incomplete.  could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
what kind?
johana, am i boring you?
sorry.  of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  what did you say?
i said that the file is incomplete.
did the driver really freeze?
like a popsicle.  they are keeping him on a stick until spring.
my god!  I am glad i did not go.
... so am i.
okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  we can not send you new equipment until our file is complete.  okay?
okay, okay.  you will have it by the end of the week, how is that?
you have made me a happy insurance person.
then, goodbye.
wait!  professor...?
... yes?
listen, i just found out we have got real problems in sicily!
what d'you mean?
the mafia!  la cosa nostra!
what is happened??
the documents are forged.
no!
yes!  the notary is a phony.  he has the same signature as the contractor!
it can not be true!
we have to send somebody over there immediately!  if we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. we will be off the hook.  there is a flight to rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to sicily.
I will send cardoza, he will be able to...
i tried him, he can not go.  his son is being bar mitzvohed tomorrow... I will go, boss.
i thought it was spanish that you spoke?
italian is practically the same thing.
mayol... mayol... no reservation.
... are you sure?
positive, sir.
this is the hotel san domenico?
yes sir, and it has been so for 127 years.
yes, but... so, you have not got a room left?
no sir, the hotel is full because of the diving championship.
ah?!
i remember.  hi roberto!
what room have you got?
i do not have one.
you do not have a room?  paolo?  what did i just hear?  i personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend jacques mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
it is okay, enzo.  I will go somewhere else.
not only is jacques mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world!  and you are throwing him out!  are you crazy, or what? stupido!
enzo drop it, I will find something.
... so, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  am i right?
yes, of course.  lots of questions.
well, what are they?
I am sorry... i do not know how to ask the questions.
that is good.
how do you make a living?  your experiments, does it pay well?
it is okay.
... you married?
no.
me neither, 'cause of my mother. she is a curse, my mamma, a tornado. stubborn as a mule!  i was engaged... for a week.  after that, mamma was so mad, i tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
so, not married.  well, good for you.  you play the field, like me. a girl in every port, huh?
exactly, i mean, after all, we are men!
damn right!  that is what i tell them when people say you have turned into a fish.
people say that?
forget it.  i was joking.
i tell you she is mine!
hello!
you know each other?
yes.
enzo molinari.
this is a great pleasure.
johana cross, pleased to meet you.  well!  is not this a coincidence. i really was not expecting this... all the way out here.  it is incredible!
please, have a seat.
thank you.  i would not want to interrupt anything.
no, no!
not at all!
you are staying at the hotel?
i wish, but it is full.  they recommended a pension in town. they say that all of taormina is full.  what is going on here?
it is the free diving world championship.  i am by the way world champion!
but what brought you to sicily?
i was doing an insurance investigation in palermo.  i work for an insurance company.  so, i decided to take a few days off.  i do not know this island at all. it really is gorgeous.
a spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
i think I will have a coffee.
no, no.  you will like it.  it is superb.
... okay.  I will try.
where did you two meet?
in a lake.
i might have known.  as i was telling you earlier, I am the world champion free diver.
congratulations.
some people say it is the most virile sport in the world.  one has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort...
enzo?
what?
your mother?
ahi, ahi, cazzo!  ma mamia! where...?  god, she will kill me...  ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
madame...
... and his friend, johana...
thanks for helping with the bag.  it looks great!
i thought it was a nice place.  is not it?
I am being a pain in the ass.  it is beautiful here.
you are going to be very busy these days are not you?
i do not know... why?
just because... i would have liked to visit the town... see the coast... i do not know anybody... expect for you.
yes... maybe... i do not know.  i do not like competitions... it ruins the fun.  do not you think?
i guess... but you know... I am american and I have mostly been taught to be competitive... there is always pleasure of being the best?
maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... you see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it.  it is a feeling... i do not know how to say this... voluptuous?
c'mon, you two... jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight.  we have a new world champion.
I am a little tired, i do not know if...
get in the car!
what about the shoes?
very chic.  anyway, you do not have anything else, do you?
no.
then, it is very chic.  avanti!
i thought you would be at the dinner.
it is too loud for me.
you look adorable.
thank you...
... especially the sneakers.
a new world record!  that is great! it gives me something to beat tomorrow!  you ever been to tahiti?
no.
I will take you there.  we will live in the sun.  you will cook fresh fish and we will make love under the coconut trees.
you forgot the hula!
yes, of course, I will do the hula!
you will be lovely, but no thanks.  jacques, would you do a native dance for me?
he looks strange, does not he? like a baby that just learned to walk.
have you known him long?
forever.  we used to live on the same island in greece, when we were kids.
what was he like, when he was little?
little.  very little.  and skinny, very skinny too.  that is compared to me.
i get it, enzo you were a superior child.
exactly!  what is it johana?  you are so crazy about him, you do not see the truth?!
and just where are you from?
italy!
why?
... for the mermaids.
today at lunch, you asked me if i had any questions.
ah ha.  you finally want to know about women.
why?  are they what is most important?
no... it depends... sometimes they are... what, exactly do you want to know?
... everything.
everything about what?
well... about everything.
why?
if we don't... I am going to beat you.
huh?  well listen to him!  do you hear that?
no.
he looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says:  "i'm going to beat you".
... that is what he is here for, is not he?
listen to her!  "that's what he is here for"!  he is here to loose, that is what he is here for.  first of all, I am unbeatable.  second, how old are you?
two years younger than you.
as i said, second of all you are too skinny.  you have got tiny lungs. i still do not understand how you can dive without getting sick.
the size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
look at me.  these are not lungs. these are... tanks.  how long can you hold your breath?
please move slowly, you are rocking the boat.
lucky i was there to save you.
you jumped in?
only to help the medics, i assure you.
my wallet.
no.  i want to show you.  is it ruined?
well, water is not exactly the best thing for pictures... not even for pictures of dolphins...
give it to me.
enzo, wake up!
eh?  si!  avanti!
the medics are looking all over for you.
I am meditating, can not you see? jacques does two hours of yoga before going down.  i can take a five minute nap, can not i?
just checking up on your family.  i guess i was drunker than i thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... well...
I am glad you stayed.  thank you.
I would better get back now.
you... you would not want to spend the day with me?
... no?
no?  huh?  yes, of course!!
how can you tell it is a female?
... the way she moves.
she is not like the others.  she can not stand to be away from the sea.
how do you know that?
i do not know, i just feel it.
tonight we are having a little party among ourselves.  8 of the clock in my suite?
okay.
tell me, why do not you go and get your medal?
because pasta should be eaten "al dente".  so the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
... it is easy.  you go down.  you come up.  ... right, johana?
congratulations, enzo.
do not you agree, jacques?
no, i have to ask you a favor...  you are the only one who will understand.
... I am listening.
hey!  will you slow down!  when did you learn how to drive?
driving is not the problem, it is remembering the right road.
and the lights!  running lights, stealing stretchers...!  you will have us in jail.
enzo, stop bitching, will you?
well, good night, then...
you going to sleep here, all by yourself?
yes...
... it is a comfortable place.
sinister is what I would call it...! ours is so much cheerful!  why do not you come and stay with me... there is plenty of room in my suite.
the mamma's there too.
yes, the mamma is is there.
good night enzo, good night jacques.
good night.
you do not need a stretcher to take her with you.  you know that, do not you?
what?
the dolphins are not the only ones who do not feel very good sometimes.
can i come watch you dive tomorrow?
uh... yes, of course!
what are they for?
they are paramedics.  they wait at 180 feet.
if there was a problem, they could do something right?
of course, that is what they are for.
... and those?
those are the divers who go down 300 to 330 feet.  they dive with a helium-oxygen mixture.  at that depth, compressed air is too dangerous because it contains carbon dioxide.
what is that little air bottle on the machine?
that is not for the divers actually. it is for the balloon.  it blows up and pulls the diver up like an elevator.  without it, with the pressure at the bottom, the diver would just stay pinned to the sea bed.
but does not jacques dive without anything?
yes... it is magic.
jacques, you set a world record.
i did?
are not you happy?  do not you feel proud...?  i feel proud and all i did was watch.
here...  here...
what is it?
little presents, nothing much... i knew it, i just knew it!  look here!
you still collect them?
yes.
you do not have that one, do you?
no.  thank you.  it is really beautiful.
oh it is nothing.  i knew it.  i told roberto "he's very good that little frenchman, very good".  i lost my title but i won a watch!
is it a poem?
no, it is the recipe for spaghetti "frutti del mare".  you see i was right in getting you out here.  you are a world champion, my friend!
I am going back home.
why?
because one should not fall in love with creatures from the sea.
I am not from the sea... i do not understand what you are talking about.
yes you do.  you know exactly what I am talking about.  you are afraid i want to hold onto you, and i do, but you are not ready... at least not for me.
but it is not true, i feel good with you... it feels right...
can i come in?
no problem, i enjoy talking in my sleep.
he does not like us.
so what!?  his job is to hand out the paychecks.  and he does that very well, let me tell you.
plenty of women everywhere right?
smoking is absolutely forbidden.
it is not lit yet.
you should not even carry cigarettes on board!
listen we are not supposed to piss either but that does not stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
the rules are the rules.
... what is your name again?
noireuter.
and where did you say you were from?
i did not say...  brussels!
... i was seventeen, i loved her so much i tried to die for her. two years later i could not even remember her name!  let me tell you, time erases everything!
i do not want to erase anything.
you would rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
... yes.
i give you this.  you are stubborn... dumb, but stubborn.
thank you.
what is with the voice?
it is nothing.  it is just the helium, because of the air pressure.
and... does the voice come back?
for others, yes... for you, who knows?
try speaking to me?
is that alcohol?  are you out of your mind?  alcohol is strictly forbidden.
hey!  d'you have any other complaints?  just make a list and we will stick it on the porthole! okay?
... and if we repaint the walls, we will need new curtains, you put the painters on you visa and I will do the curtains on american express... for the couch there is bloomingdales...  or are you still over your limit?
way past it.
does that have a hidden meaning?
no.  I am just depressed.
you look it too.  you have not been working out, you have not been taking your vitamins!  you have not been drinking your herbs, you have not been...
i know, i know!  I am a terrible person...  it's... I am so damn, damn sad.
what is it honey... the frenchy?
do you think i should have stayed? do not you think maybe i should have stayed?  I have been a jerk, right?  i should have stayed!  i was supposed to be in love... i was in love!  i am in love, why did i act like a bitch?  he went swimming. all the man did was go swimming! i must be crazy.  it was too good to be true.
vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
good afternoon.
i came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
yes.  of course.  very wise.
remember when i went to italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  well, we were not being cheated by the mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... do they come for lunch everyday? i really went on my own business, to see a man that i happen to be in love with... and I am glad i did it, but I am sorry about the policy and I will be happy to make up the money the company did not get... of course just now i do not have...  one million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  but if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we would be even... and i think this is where you fire me?
you are right.  you are fired.
will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I am pregnant.
the italian, i presume?
no.  he is french, he was just in italy for the competition.
he seems to have won it.
yes, is not it wonderful?  I am so happy.  I will bet I am the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
hello?
it is me... johana.
how are you?
i got fired.
... that is funny... i had this job with enzo... we got fired too.
so have i.  ... hello?
I am still here.
well, then, talk to me some more.
... it is hard you know.  you are so far away and i do not know what else to say.
then, tell me a story.
uh... ah!  a story?
do you know how it is?  do you know what you are supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
no... tell me.
you go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water is not even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there...  and you decide that you will die for them... only then do they start coming out.  they come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... if it is sincere.  if it is pure... they will be with you and take you away forever.
hello?
it is me again.
I am being a pain, huh?
... not at all.
you sure?
absolutely positive.
okay.  in that case... I am at the airport in nice.
why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
you will understand.
assassin!
uncle louis, this is my friend johana.
did you buy the cassettes?  the wagner, the berlioz?
i brought johana to meet you.
are you crazy?  i have no use for a woman!  since my accident.
no, no.  johana is visiting me.
bonjour monsieur... louis.
uncle louis.  he is a 75 year old amazing guy, is not he?
I am very pleased to meet you, uncle louis.
where are you from, henrietta?
johana... new york.
what kind of name is that?  to be named after a city?
he does not hear too well.
uncle louis!
no, no.  it is true.  when i was in new york, oh boy!  before my accident, you understand?
good.  that way I will see more of you... where are you going to stay?
well... here.
in my apartment?
it is my apartment.
liar!  thief!  torturer!  when you were an orphan i nursed you at my breast.
uncle louis, we have a guest!
I am going to put a lock on the telephone.  did you bring the cassettes?
jacques!  johana!
enzo!
where did you get that?
"that"!  this is not a "that"...
you are going to live here permanently?
... maybe, if jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
he is shy, not like enzo.
yes.  not like enzo.
i think, he is really nice... he is a funny guy... sometimes even very moving.
... I am pregnant, bonita!
are you going to keep it?
yes.
does he know?
no.
maybe you should talk to him about it.
i can't... i just do not know how to...
i was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  you know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the gods.  take leda for example, sleeping with jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... well, can you imagine leda announcing to her swan "you're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
but your man is not quite a god!
probably not, but i still do not have the nerve to tell him.
well, you are going to have to tell him, sometime!
and you...?  do you love enzo?
very much, i think.  but, there is going to be a problem.
uncle louis, you remember enzo's mother signora molinari from amorgos?
the whale!  how could i forget? always was something fishy about that woman!
what were italians doing living in greece anyway?
louis, we were french!
that is different!  what is the matter with you?
anybody can have a bad day!
I have had many... when the sea does not want you.
it is never the sea!  it is roberto, mamma, that stupid actress... oh shit!  jacques, what do you know?
and you?
i did not dive.
you will try again tomorrow?
i do not know... it did not feel right.  I am going to bed.  I am tired.
what?
... nothing.
you are leaving?
yes...  could you please give this to enzo.
of course.
bonita, you should not be discouraged so easily.
i do not have the strength to fight off la mamma... anyway who wants to spend their whole life waiting at the end of a pier.
did you tell him?
not yet... I am waiting for the right moment.
... you take care of yourself, johana.
enzo, enzo!  congratulations!
thank you, thank you very much!
what are you doing?
I am putting you on the coin... your essence... that way you will always be with me when i dive.
that is good.
enzo, do not be angry.  i was lucky... that is all.
jacques...?
you go back, I will walk.
what is wrong?
it is nothing.  just the long trip. I am a little jet-lagged.
you want to lie down for a while?
no, I will be fine.  can you just hand me a glass of water?
is he here?
he is training.
okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
what are you doing here?
checking out the competition.
enzo, why do you guys do this?
what else is there?
you know what I am talking about.
you risk your life when you cross the street.
damn it!  why will not you give me a straight answer, for once?!
because you would laugh.
i won't, i swear.
i dive in search of god.  if i go deep enough I am going to find him.
a little... you think it is the same for jacques?
no.  jacques is a creature of the sea.  he is not meant to live on earth, among us... you should know this, johana.
he can learn.  he is learning.
you really think so?  did you tell him you were pregnant?
how do you know that?
you told bonita, but you did not tell him, right?
... not yet.
don't.
why?
because he will not understand and it will just hurt you... jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake.  and he is only waiting for one thing:  that some god up there will turn him into a fish! how long has that moron been down there?
five minutes and fifty seconds.
that idiot!
is he alright?  what happened?
the fool was asleep!  if i were not around, he would already be dead!!! is that who you want to live with?
... how long was i asleep?
long enough to die.  listen, if you really want to die, that is your problem, but do not do it under my nose, okay?
... when you dive... with that machine... what does it feel like?
... the feeling of slipping without falling... the hardest is once you are at the bottom.
why?
because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... and i always have a hard time finding one.
I am concentrating.
we can not dive anymore.  they want to cancel the competition for a while.
it is not safe, they say.  the doctors say it is not possible to go deeper and live.  free diving is over as a sport.
you say that because you have the title!
no!  i would never cheat you.
well that is very nice of you.
you were right.
... i was right about what?
... it is much better down there. it is a better place.
... push me back in the water...
i can't.
jacques, take me back down... please.
I will go see how he is doing.
let him sleep.
you have got to tell me what happened?
i saw how it has to be.
jacques?  I am pregnant.
that is good... that is wonderful. it is wonderful for you.
you are the father.
promise me one thing.
anything.
promise you will not forget me.
