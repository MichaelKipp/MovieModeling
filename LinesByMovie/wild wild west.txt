well?
they're coming.
when are they coming?
they're rounding up a posse.  figure an hour?
in an hour they're gone!
hey...!
you're not going to use it, are you?
well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
right.
don't try to bamboozle me, colonel. has another scientist been kidnapped or not?
well, yes sir.  a professor morton, but with just a little more time, sir, i can assure you a breakthrough on this case...
listen, in two days i'm embarking on a tour of the western territories.  and i want to know at least one problem is being handled competently in my absence.
of course, sir, that's why i've assigned a new man.  and he's no ordinary marshal.  he's quite sophisticated.  three college degrees.  a master of disguise. speaks french...
french?
yes sir.
french?  damn it, i want my own man on this case.  somebody i trust. somebody who doesn't mind breaking up the furniture!
mr. president, good to see you again, sir.  sorry about all that.
that'll be all, boys.
good work.  really.
this is colonel richards.
nice to finally meet you, sir.
why surely, mr. president, there must be some mistake.  i mean...
a mistake?  to assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the chattanooga river and single- handedly trapped jackson's entire cavalry?  how is that a mistake?
but what would anyone have to gain from all this...?  unless it were a foreign power.
exactly.  any number of nations would love to cripple our scientific growth.  and what better way to tip the scales in their favor than by killing off the greatest minds this country has produced.
we find ourselves at the dawn of the golden age of science.  and it is the god-given destiny of this glorious nation to carry the torch that lights the way!
nicely said, sir.
part of some speech they wrote for this trip i'm taking.
goddamnit!  what am i doing?  what's happened to all my cigars?  colonel richards here has had a dozen agents on these cases for over a year.  no arrests, no leads, no clues...
and?
and now the job's yours.
look, i'm captain james west...
well, captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
your private train, sir.
private train?
that would be correct.  orders from the president himself.  trans- portation at your beck and call. no delays.  although, the government's generosity takes me a tad by surprise, as well.
doyle's the name, sir.  of the connemara doyles.  and there's not a man riding the rails who holds a candle to meself.  that having been said, sir, you're five minutes late so let's be on our way!  your friend's already aboard.
my friend?
j. s. bach.
jim west.
artemus gordon.  bach, he's the composer.
i don't mind him, but who the hell are you... my valet or something?
valet?  you jest of course.  i am a u.s. marshal.
funny.  so am i.
congratulations.  unfortunately, my train is about to leave, and i really must insist you disembark.
your train?  listen, friend, you're obviously lost.  ... i've got orders here to take possession of this train and to investigate a certain crime.
interesting.  mine say the same thing, and they don't mention you, not even as a valet, although we could talk...
just another bureaucratic foul-up. you know how these pencil-pushers are.  so, why don't you just run on back and explain what happened?
funny, i was just thinking you should do the same.  since i am already in residence, and am obviously the man for the job, it's been grand making your acquaintance, sir.  and best of luck in all your future endeavors.
you're quite the wordsmith, fiddle boy.  but nobody smooth-talks his way into my assignment.
if you're implying our little imbroglio has reached an impasse whose only resolution can be found in a more primitive fashion, then i for one am fully prepared to do so... al fresco.
but don't pull that again.
wouldn't dream of it.
eight scientists.  eight different fields of endeavor.  hydraulics, optics, ballistics...
put them all together and what do we have?
a giant... hydraulically operated microscope... that explodes?  or maybe just someone who hates scientists.
then why kidnap them?  why not just kill them?
"ay, there's the rub."  take a look at this file on professor morton.  quite a brilliant fellow... metallurgy.
sorry.  didn't mean that.  just a little device of mine...
wait a minute.  now i know where i've heard of you.  you're the gadget guy.
"gadget guy?"  while i may not be in a league with these unfortunate geniuses, i am, sir, in my own humble way, a man of science.
attractive buttons, yes?  but yank one off, toss it, and poof!  it emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
you need that real often?
always hoping.  or this...
no offense, but all i ever need...  are these...  and this.
good lord, man.  the world is changing.  and mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  we, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
all right, if it'll make you happy, i'll try that.
try what?
your little jack-in-the-box gun. that might be useful.
well... it's the only one i have. it's gotten me out of quite a few tight spots...
that should put us ahead of the criminals.
i'll work on it.
aha!
aha?
yes, aha.  a brass screw.
is this leading somewhere?
potentially.  this is the painstaking process of piecing together clues.  the cornerstone of the modern science of criminology.  piece by piece we reconstruct the identity of the villain.
starting with a screw?
yes.  starting with a screw.  now, it's not fair of me to expect someone who's spent his life wrangling with western desperadoes to fully appreciate what i'm doing here, but...
what about the explosive?
limestone quarry?
limestone quarry, southern mansion. easy to get them mixed up... i say we invite ourselves to the party.
absolutely.  have to look for clues... even if it means dancing with beautiful women.
doyle, once around the park.  i need a moment to prepare.
prepare what?
my disguise.  and here...
come llewellyn, don't tarry.
call me that again, and you're going to find a boot where it doesn't belong.
jim, people talk to foreigners, speak more openly, especially to those as famous as i, chauncey mcneil armstrong, english lyric poet.
that's a lot of butler.
quite.  come, let's mingle.
do your own mingling.  i'm not hanging around with some dandy named chauncey.
my name's tyler.  frank tyler. pleased to meet you, ma'am.
i get that feeling.  you know, mr. tyler, i'm the kind of woman who doesn't believe men are much more than a complete waste of time. but after spying you across the room, i'm tempted to suspend my disbelief, at least for the evening.
you know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol i once owned. a beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
i don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
please do.  i'm a man who appreciates a good firearm.
really?
well, where i come from it kind of goes with the territory.  texas.
my... the wild west.
well, sir, you are proving to be one of my more interesting guests.
your guests, ma'am?
yes, in a way.  i'm the doctor's social secretary.  i handle his correspondence, send out the invitations, you know.
oh, don't worry.  i've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
well, i owe you one, don't i?
you most certainly do.
a new friend?
we'll see.
i admire a man with a sense of humor.
when you're three and a half feet tall, sir, life turns you into a comedian whether you like it or not.... come with me, won't you?
i must compliment you on miss thompson... an exceptionally charming assistant.
thank you.  i confess to a preoccupation with acquiring precisely that which the world says i cannot have.
anyone?
here.  mr. tyler.  he claims a certain skill at handling firearms.
wonderful!  our new friend from the wild west.  please...
very good, sir!  i think my guest might be a sharpshooter by trade.
no, sir... just a businessman.
really?  must be a dangerous business.
i deal with some tough customers.
sir... i believe you have only two barrels.
how embarrassing.  did i hold up three fingers?
you must excuse the doctor.  no one has ever beaten him at his little game.
i don't like to lose, either.
have you taken a wrong turn, mr. tyler?
you tell me.
i'm not so sure dr. loveless would like to find his social secretary dancing in the dark with an uninvited stranger.
forgive me, but you don't strike me as the social secretary type.
thank you.  but the truth is, i'm a single woman in a man's world. that leaves me very few choices, doesn't it?
i suppose so.  but life can be hard for a man, too.
just a little insurance... against the unexpected.
would that include me?
oh, i would hope not.
you've... done... this... before.
i've had some practice.
doctor v. l. pemberton.  i knew it.  he's a scientist all right. inventor of the pemberton condensed steam engine.  i'm telling you, artemus, loveless is our man.
whoa, jim.  maybe.  but we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
all right.  how about this?  we put a watch on this pemberton, somebody tries to grab him...
then we've got our proof. excellent.  and where do we find this fortunate scientist?
you know your morse code almost as well as i.
almost?
yes.  now, observe....
you feeling all right?
come on, jim.  i'm serious.  dot...  dash.  it'll be our secret means of communication should we ever need it.
now, what was that?
you're either having a seizure or you just said "hello."
good, i wasn't sure you were up to it.
dr. pemberton?
yes!
terribly sorry.  i'm always sticking this where it doesn't belong.  federal agents, ma'am.  we're rescuing a kidnap victim...
yes, me!
you?  dr. pemberton?  of course. how novel.
gotta get the doctor someplace safe.
who were they?  what do they want with me?
we'll explain on the way.
what was all that back there?
all what?
all that jumping and kicking.
that?  oh, it's a kind of chinese fighting... i was sort of caught once with a lovely chinese girl out in san francisco.  her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  i've got a book on it, if you're interested.
i only met him once, but that was enough.  for such a little man he had quite an oversized opinion of himself.  he offered me the "rare and unparalleled opportunity" to develop a new steam engine for him.  he claims to have some sort of factory in texas, i believe. said i could have the run of the place.  he had all sorts of specifications.  but when i questioned him closely, it became obvious he was just another mercenary businessman.  both he and his partner had no real love of steam.  it's sad.  so few men do.
who was this partner of his?
a southern gentlemen.  i don't recall his name.  i suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
a glass eye?  that's who it was! one-eyed jack garrison.  otherwise known as general garrison, confederate third army.  i saw him at dr. loveless' party, but i couldn't place him.  he used to wear an eye-patch.
garrison...?  then the president was right.  except it's not a foreign power, it's a bunch of die- hard rebels trying to make the south rise again.
and if they've got dr. loveless building weapons like those flying bombs... they just might do it.
could i just point out, this is a perfect example of the criminal mind exploiting modern invention.
i'm going to hit you.
never seen a gun fire so fast!
it's a repeating steam cannon!
at least i tried something.
hey, i tried the board.
damn it, this is ridiculous.
at least the thing's not that fast. we just follow it.  whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
that's right... that's good.
jim, are you all right?
no, i'm not all right.  they got away.  and we can't even follow them.  they can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
which is why we're heading to houston, texas.  home of the loveless steam engine works.
if you don't mind my asking, were you always the way you are?
what way is that?
so... spontaneous.  all that leaping off buildings and chinese fighting and whatnot.
"spontaneous."  i like that.  most people say something like "hare- brained reckless son-of-a-bitch."
well... that, too.
nothing much to it really.  when i was younger i got into a pretty bad run-in with the wyler boys.  i saw them coming.  but i didn't act fast enough.  second-guessed myself. and it cost me... cost me dearly.
so... what happened?
those kids, they took my wagon. never got it back.
uh... how long ago was this?
i was six.  and ever since, my policy is: act first and worry later.
you might have mentioned you had that.
i thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
i find most criminals slip up somewhere...
they're so precious when they're asleep.
you really enjoy yourself, don't you?
can you fill me in here?
sure.  we have no idea what's going on.
thank you.
come on, let's at least see if we can find dr. pemberton.
you go ahead.  i'll stick with loveless.
she's perfectly safe.
really?  like general garrison or didn't you hear all that shooting?
my.  it's gotten longer.
you bring the best out in a man.
i try.  please, if you promise to protect me, i'll testify against him. i'll give you an ironclad case.
why don't we just cut this routine short?  whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
talk?  about what...?  oh!  about who you are and all that?
know what this is?
sure.  it's a wind-up... thing.
a cylinder recorder.  my own design.
... and do give me some room, voltaire.  you're breathing on my head!  i hate it when you breath on my head!
dr. loveless?
this is good.
shhh!  come on.  tell us something!
oh, damn!  that's it.
it's better than nothing.
it is?
he's going to put on a pith helmet and kill some guy named willard.
no record of him.
you'd think if loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
what's this?
sounds like a train.  looks like a train.
yes.  and a much nicer one than ours.
... well, of course you can.  mr. president, what a surprise.  what brings you here?
on my way to denver...
where'd he say he was going to do this?
he didn't.  that's your job.  i'm taking you off that other case until you've nabbed this lunatic. good luck.  nice train.  but mine's nicer.
willard...
it's not a guy...
it's a town!
got to be somewhere that's hot. he said it was "damnably hot."
that rules out willard, vermont; willard, minnesota...  willard, new mexico?
damn, i wish this thing would go faster.
relax.  we're almost there.
we oughta get a couple of those rockets.  voom!  we're there before we left!
what is that?
this?  i'm testing a new spirit gum, to see how it holds.
and people are actually fooled by that?
my disguises have helped me solve many a difficult case.  i spent three years on the stage, you know.  remind me sometime to regale you with my lear.
not again.
i adjusted it.
so the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
you said it popped out too easily. nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
when we find him, he is mine.
oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
what if these tracks are just leading us to an indian village or some old coot's mining claim?
not likely.  there must be tracks of twenty different wagons.  freight wagons, carriages, buckboards...
excellent detective work, sir.  you should have the honor of going first.
oh, thank you.
my pleasure.
you're not that big.
restrain yourself, voltaire.  he's just the sort of coward who would shoot an unarmed giant.
still alive.  hmm.  i suppose that doesn't bode well for poor bruno.
he had a pressing engagement.
philistine.
you got that right.  now get up. we're walking out of here.
has it penetrated that adrenaline- addled skull that you are surrounded by seventy-eight of my loyal followers?  you are in my domain!
has it penetrated yours that i'm holding a gun on their leader?
the u.s. is my jurisdiction.
exactly!  you are on foreign soil. you are a representative of the occupying forces.  or haven't you checked a map lately?!
these lands were taken by force from mexico in the illegal war of american aggression.
that would be... the mexican war?
call it what you like.  the point is, i was heir to that land, mr. west.  it belonged to my beloved grandmother!  now i intend to have it back.  my own country!
i've even printed my own currency.
"emperor miguelito...?"
the first.
well, your highness, what makes you think we'll ever sign a treaty with you?
because i am holding all the western territories hostage, mr. west!  a town a day will disappear!  willard was merely a test run, a stroll in the park.  next, i level all of albuquerque!  yes, that's right.  only yesterday i learned what you undoubtedly already know: your own president will be there.  what an added bonus! the gods are shining on me!  after tomorrow every american citizen will rise up and demand i be given back my humble little empire!
so, i'm the only one here who can tell the difference between an emperor and a murderer?
are you all right?
for the moment.  but i fear not for long.  i'm of no use to him now.
he... he's planning to kill us, isn't he?
he's just full of plans that aren't gonna work out.
this is something.
it's a smelting retort.
now it's a bomb.
it is?
artemus, you ready for this?  his next target is albuquerque.
what?  president grant is...!
i know!  i know!
i don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
we've got to stop him right here, now!  with that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
i'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
there's only seventy-eight.
oh, well, then let's kick some ass!
you didn't tell us you had this on!
my lord, he was telling the truth!
it was in your book.
well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
are those just button buttons or...?
of course not.
my hat is off to you, sir.
thank you.
i beg your pardon?
you don't know what he's built?! surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
god in heaven, what is that?!
that's... that's the criminal mind about to stomp our sorry butts!
he calls it the tarantula.
but it only has six legs.
he's not giving up?
well, see, he had this little wagon when he was a kid...
i could get used to this, looking down on people.
they don't even realize they should be frightened.
well, let's help them with that. take the legs.
would you be thinking... ramming speed, sir?
i would, mr. doyle!  are you game?
time for you to get off, ma'am.
like hell!  i'll see it through! ram the bastard!
my god!  he's so excessive!
where have you been?
pull the balloon right in front of him!  we'll board the damn thing!
oh, i see, an easy plan!
you know, i really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
fine, i'll stop.
easy now.
easy?  easy?  on just what grounds should i take it easy!?
the machine was stopped!  it seemed like a perfect time to disable it! why'd you have to throw it into full throttle?!
he was going to shoot me!  do you mind?!
all right, all right... it'll be okay.  i mean, eventually it'll just run out of steam.
in the next two minutes?
artemus!  look at that.  brand spanking new.  she's a beauty, huh?  let's get rolling.
what is this?  a whole new train?
well, sure.  didn't you get your orders?
well, we'll stay in touch... you know.
i'm sure we will.
