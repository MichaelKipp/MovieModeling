just do what i do.  say the same thing i say.  don't open your mouth.
okay.
don't fool around.
okay.
did you hear what i said?
i want to document my trip to america.
next.  could i see your documents, please?
yes sir.
what is your intended purpose of your visit to the united states?
two weeks holiday.
how much money are you carrying with you?
i have five-hundred dollars.
can you show me?  sir, no cameras in the fis area!
is he with you?  are you travelling together?
yes.
please join us.  come on forward.
is there a problem?
no, you're travelling together.  i want to talk to you together.  hi, how are you?  can i take a look at your documents?  are you related?
yes...he's my friend.
okay.  you're a czech national and you're a russian national.  how do you know one another?
we are both from prague.
how long are you planning to stay?
two weeks.
i'd like to speak for himself, okay?
he doesn't speak english.
i speak english.
then answer my questions.  where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here?
new york.
yes, we're in new york now.  but where are you planning to stay in new york?
a cheap hotel.
what are you coming here to do?
i'm here for movies.
movies...to be in the movies or to see movies?
yes.  no.  both.  when i was a boy, i see movie at school called "it's a wonderful life" directed by frank capra. ever since i want to come to america. land of the free.  home of the brave.  a land where anyone can be anything. as long as they are white.
excuse me?
so we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got emergency service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  i say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  i go to get the cigar and boom!  all the sudden i turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  right where i was standin'.  that coulda been it.  i coulda had my head blown off and for what?  some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  if i hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - i would've had my head blown off.
jesus christ.
coffee for me, i gotta slow down.
vodka tonic.
maybe you could just put in a shot of martell?
it was freaky, i'll tell you.  stupid kid.
what's the kid gonna say - sorry? meanwhile i'm not here anymore. like last week - we were at the morgue and this guy was all chopped up - spleen here - liver there - his heart in a pan. six hours ago this guy was walkin' his dog or buyin' a quart of milk.  who knows?  but some kid's robbed him for $3 or some shit and shot him and now you can't tell if he's a piece of beef or a human being and i'm thinkin' that's me. sooner or later.  that's me.
sooner or later that's everybody.
not chopped up.  not chopped up like that.  i mean, what do i got left? coupla articles.  a medal or two. plaque here and there and in a coupla years no one remembers me anymore.
i think you're getting a little moody there, eddie.
i'm not moody.
isn't he a little moody?
of course he's moody.  he thinks he's in love.
in love?  with who?
how old are your kids?
my kids?  let's see...susan's 15. aundrea's 9.  don't tell me you're thinking about having a kid!  how old are you?  never mind. let me just tell you this: every stupid cliche you hear about kids - they change your life, they make you a better person, they make you whole...  it's all true!  before i had kids when friends talked about their kids, i wanted to vomit.  now -- i get it.  am i right, leon?
yeah?
paulie, you've got kids, right?
okay.  you work in a vodka factory.  i understand that.  and what kind of work do you do?
i am butcher.
you're a butcher?  what do you use pig intestines for?
you stuff sausage in it.
and what do you do with the bones?
dog food.
are you married?
no.  are you proposing?
i'm gonna propose.
when?
tomorrow.  at lunch.
you ready?
look.  times square.  just like in the movies!
don't speak russian!
why?  why do i always have to speak to you in czech?
because i don't like your ugly language. i heard enough of it in school!  now speak czech or english.  and don't fool around anymore.  you almost got us thrown out!
look.  new videocameras.  color viewfinder.  image stabilization. solarization.  night vision.
we have no money.  come on.
so what's unique?
not what.  who.
he's from antigua.  his girlfriend was taking too long to put her make-up on. they were late for a party.  stabbed her with a beer bottle.
that's unique.
yeah.  and he still went to the party.
i hope this prick doesn't run.  my knees are killing me.  stay behind me.
you're worried for my safety.  i'm touched.
ready?
keep them out of my way.
okay.  you ready?
yeah, yeah.  jesus.
any chance we can do that again?
again?  i didn't wanna do it the first time.
turn that off!  get the bags.
why should i carry your bag?  i am not a dog.
for five years i paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if i say so.  unless you refuse, oleg.
what?
smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs.
emil???!
surprise!  surprise!
your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
did you hurt her?
you know me...i never hurt anybody. where's the money?
take your eyes off her, oleg!  look.  it wasn't my fault you two were caught.  it's his fault.  trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  i wasn't going to wait!!!
milos.  get my money!
we spent it!
ha. ha.
look at the way we live.  i'm a plumber. you think i'd be working if i had money?!
i can get you a job.
a job?
yes, the money is good.
as a plumber?!
it's easy to learn.
a job??  as a plumber???  you think i come to america to work!
we started over, you can too.
you spent all the money while i was in prison?  now you tell me to get a job fixing toilets?!?
got any spare change?  how 'bout a spare twenty?
look, i don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
alright, how 'bout all your fuckin' money?
okay, you're under arrest!  now you happy?
fire department?  firemen don't carry guns.
oh yeah?  guess again.
i'll send a cop back for you.
hey.  c'mon, you can't leave me like this.  some freak'll come by and stab me!
where you been, man?  we got a celebrity!
i heard.  who the hell let them up there?
i don't know, you think eddie will give me his autograph?
you see anything in the crowd?  anybody suspicious?
naw - i'm sure the suspect's not here.
oh yeah, why?
'cause eddie woulda locked him up by now!
nah, not at all.  detective flemming - bobby korfin.  my uncle tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie.
could you put out the cigar?  part of the job is picking up scents.
hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  it gives us somethin' to do.
no, we don't mind.  you mind leon?
no.  go ahead.
thanks.  appreciate it.
mouth's clean, too.
clean?
don't blow your nose!
the smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  let it run.
but you knew that, right?
so the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up?
that's what it looks like to me.
and while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  you got to hand it to them.
yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight.
what was that?
evidence.  of a homicide.
you know what that is, right?
no, what is it?
why don't you explain it, bobby.  hey camello!  you mind punching a hole in the floor?
what's he looking for?
a timer.
you see eddie's face when i gave him the timer?  wish i had a picture of it.
he knew all along.
what??
that's why he was so quiet.  he was testing us.
detective, does it look like a murder?
we don't know that yet.  it's much too early.  there's a lot to be done.
how many victims are up there?
there are two bodies found at this point.
can we go up to the crime scene?
you know you can't do that.  c'mon.
is it drug related?
we don't know.  when i have more i'll let you know.
what?
there was a woman - i think she wanted to talk to us.  she looked scared.  oh shit!  oh no!
you okay?
a dog pissed on me!!  i'm gonna sue you for this!  you violated my civil rights!
your civil rights?!  you tried to rob me!  i could arrest you right now! you're lucky you're walking away from this.  now get outta here.
turn that fucking thing off!
i'm not filming.  i'm watching milos die.  it's just like a move but realer.
speak english!
you said speak czech!
how you erase this?
i'll do it.  don't hurt my camera!
whore?
i'm homesick.  you have eastern european girl?  a czech girl?
now that you know him, maybe you can get extra work in the next movie they make about him.
yeah?
maybe you can be his stand-in.
who did cause and origin?
who do you think, chief?!
then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
'cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
don't you guys understand?  it's all about image.  the better we look the more money i get to pay you guys overtime.
yeah, right.
what was that, korfin?
i said, yeah, you're right, chief.  as soon as we get somethin' we'll let you alert the media.
you do that, wiseguy.  now let's solve this thing before eddie flemming does.
what's that on your forehead, max? that's a nice attention getter.
yeah, i'm religious.  i'm not an atheist like you!  now, are you guys gonna arrest me, or not?
how did you start the fire this time?
i used an accelerant.
yeah?  what kind?
hey, by the way, i'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
this had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. these people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor.
your doctor?
yes.  my psychiatrist didn't insist that i stay on my medication.
...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people?
it was my finger that pulled the trigger, but i'm not morally responsible.  my psychiatrist knew what i was capable of.  how could i know. i'm not a doctor.
you seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial.
look, i'm a victim here, too.  i was a year away from getting my masters in art, now i'll never graduate.  my life has been permanently disrupted.
permanently disrupted?  aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist?
look, i'm in here.  you call this a career move?
and isn't there a movie in the works about you?
we're in negotiations, that's correct.
but doesn't the son of sam law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes?
that doesn't apply to me because i'm not a criminal.  i'm not a criminal!  i wasn't convicted.
get in the bathroom!
whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up!
hi, i'm honey.
where's czech girl?
baby, i'm anybody you want me to be. i'm a little schoolgirl, i'm mommy, i'm a czech girl.
now i like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  why don'tchya put my money on the dresser.
i ordered a czech girl.  daphne, you know her?
it's an outcall service run out of an apartment.  i don't meet the other girls.  aren't you gonna get undressed?
where is escort service?
that's confidential.  could you put the money on the dresser?
i like to talk to the person who runs the service.  can you give me address?
look.  do we have a problem here? there's no reason to have a problem. i'm gonna make you feel real good.  you wanna czech girl? after i'm done with you, you won't miss her.  now why don't you pay me?
listen to me.  i don't want sex.  just give me the address and then you go.
look, man, i don't give a shit if you want sex or not, but you're payin' for my time.
give me the address!!
alright, alright - don't hurt me! please, it's in my book, in my purse!
-- from czechoslovakia?  and how long have they been livin' in your building?  alright, i'll be in touch when we know somethin'.  milos and tamina karlova.  they were quiet and kept to themselves.  landlord don't know who your girl is.
how long they been livin' here?
you hear that question, garcia?
you go home.  i'm takin' your car and goin' back to the crime scene.
aren't you tired?
if i go home i won't be able to fall asleep anyway.
it's your crime scene now.  you can do what you want.
watch the news?
nah, i musta missed it.
well, just so you know.  i gave you guys the credit.
well, just so you know, i don't care about that stuff.
nah, why should you?
i don't even watch tv.
good.  good.  commendable.
did you get a report from the m.e.?
sure.  but i would like to ask you something.  you got a problem with me?
if you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too.  what about the report?
you were right, they were both dead before the fire.  the male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  that's usually an indicator of something personal.
the super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
pretty.
hmmmm.
maybe you don't care about that either.  prettiest suspect i've had in awhile.
who says she's a suspect?
what would you call her?
look, i'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  i saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. maybe she saw something.  maybe she was visiting somebody here.  who knows?
maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  burial rites are taken very seriously in eastern europe.  it could be to humiliate them. just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
eastern europe.  like what?  romania? hungary?
or czechoslovakia.  the slavs have been fighting the germans and the russians for a thousand years.  these are very intense people and they take things personally.
i'll come with you.
there wasn't a fire.  there'll be nothing for you to do.
i can watch you, eddie.  maybe i'll learn something.
this isn't homicide school.
my parents are from poland.  i can help with the eastern european angle.
you're polish?
my folks are.
stay here.
who is he?
new york's finest.  this is his case.
this all you want?
do you know how much killer gets for movie rights?
in here, says he wants a million.
million?!  the killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
hey, tabloids paid ted bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  and how much you think monica got for writing book about the president coming on to her?  it pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. look, you want magazine or not?
yes.  both.
where is she?
takin' a bath.
any i.d.?
still unknown but we're running prints. kid over there caught the case.
sorry...pd only.
it's okay.
room was registered to a francis capra.
capra?  that's not czech or russian. who said he sounded russian?
the clerk?
only one guys checked in?
yeah.
c'mere.  you wanna go to homicide school?  here - make yourself useful.
you goin' to the escort service?
you got any better ideas?
mind if i ride along with you?
this has nothing to do with your fire.
but what if it does?  you might need my help.
i'll let you know what happens.
this is ridiculous.  i'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over.
tell you what - i'll flip you a coin. if you win you can come with me.  if you don't win, you don't come.
i'll call it... tails.
two heads.
better than one.
who's there?
police.  we'd like to ask you a few questions.
i have nothin' to say.  if you wanna contact my attorney...
homicide, miss hearn.  it's detective eddie flemming.  open up.
what's wrong?
we don't have her i.d. yet, but one of your girls was killed last night at the king edward hotel.
oh my g-d.  honey!  honey's dead?
yeah.  he wanted a girl from czechoslovakia, but i sent him honey 'cause once they get there, you know, it doesn't really matter - honey was killed...?  poor girl...
do you have any czech girls working for you?
no.
did you tell him you did?
boy, she's so popular all the sudden.
what are you saying?
daphne.  another guy came in asking me about her, too.
he said he was her cousin.  i told him where she works.  they were just here.
describe him.
tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  and he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
he had a videocamera?  where is she? quickly!
she washes hair up at ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and madison.
leon - meet us at 63rd and madison. hair salon.  ludwig's.
i'm on my way with eddie.  ludwig's. 63rd and madison.  the suspects might be there already.
you thirsty?
i'm on duty.
so am i.  alright, i'll go inside and you cover the back.
of course.
hey!  i always wanted to be a cop when i was a kid.  i dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'freeze!' at the bad guy! what'd you dream about?
i wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid.
then i guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  if we pull up to a burning building i'll gladly let you go first.
the other side of the street.  the guy with the videocamera.  don't look - put her in the car.  stay this side.
stay with her.
are you hit?
no.  i'm okay.
bobby, bobby!  where're you hit?!
it hurts.  aw, jesus!
lay down.  stay down, bobby.
he got my gun!  motherfucker was filming the whole time!
i know.  relax.  take it easy.  don't worry, we'll get those fuckers.
detective - can you tell us what happened here?
i can't talk right now.  we have some things to take care of.
i understand, but i noticed that the fire marshall is here with you.  is this somehow related to the fire department?
i really can't give out any information right now at this point.
okay.  but i do understand that your partner, leon jackson's been injured. is that correct?
he was hurt, but not seriously.  he'll be fine.
do you have the suspect in custody?
um...now is not a good time, okay. detective jackson's hurt.  he's fine. i've got a fire marshall shot, detective jackson is hurt but not seriously.
alright, cut, cut, cut.
eddie, are you okay?
yeah.  now's not a good time.
alright.
alright?
alright.
alright.
okay.
i told your partner, i can't help.  i didn't see anything.
c'mon, start at the beginning.  you know these people?
tamina was a friend of mine.  my shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
go on.
whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  better if it comes from you.
if i tell you, will you arrest me?
arrest you for what?  why would we arrest you?
what are you hiding?  why are you afraid
she just saw two of her friends killed! they probably threatened her.
is that all there is?
are you here illegally?  don't worry about that.  we'll talk to immigration. they won't deport you.
no, no, don't talk to immigration!
why not?
something back home?
...my little sister and i shared a flat - i came home one night and a man was raping her.  his gun was on the chair... he came at me and i shot him.
alright.  that's a justifiable homicide.
yes, but he was a cop.
a cop?
i'm from a small town in slovakia.  like the south here.  the police is right, a civilian is wrong.  so i fled.
look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. tell us the truth...is that the truth?
you're a cop - you'll never believe me.
she's fucked.  even if that story is true.
raw deal.
look - let me talk to her.  any leads i get, they're all yours.  just let me have a first crack at her.
you wanna talk to her alone?
yeah.
what would your girlfriend think of that?
i don't have a girlfriend.
my point exactly.
i'm serious here.
so am i.
c'mon.  you intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  she sees me differently.
you're her savior?  is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
you know what i'm saying here.
okay, tell you what, i'll give you a head start.  you take her to the station house.  don't let her out of your sight. she's the only warm body we got left.
hey.  i'm a professional.
women like that have a way of turning professionals into amateurs.
gotta light the scene better.  now it's more moody... like a scene from the third man.
shut up.
does it hurt?
oh, shit.  i hate looking at that!
don't want to film this?
now i become custody of police department?
if you cooperate with the da - maybe they'll help you with your situation.
i will if they don't send me back.
they won't until this is over.
are you married?
divorced.
do you live alone?  i've been in these clothes since...the killings.  could we stop at your place? i could take a shower...before i go into custody?
i can't take you to my place.
somewhere else?
hey, honey.
hey.
what is your problem?  why'd you snap at me?  i just wanted a statement.
i can't...i can't answer you just because you want me to answer you!
you didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  you could give me something.
oh, i'm sorry.  did i embarrass you, sweetheart?  oh...
stop it.
maybe i should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out?
alright, alright, eddie.  don't patronize me.
i'm not.
yes you are.  i'm not just some reporter.  i don't just stick a microphone in your face.  you could give me something.
yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  that was...
that was good.  you were holding the evidence.
you were merciless.  you didn't give a shit if you got me or not.
well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  huh?
you're ruthless.
you're not so bad yourself.
look at this.  you have blood on your shirt.  whose is it?
could be leon's.
jesus.  and last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  what am i going to do with you?
don't worry about the damn phone.  i won't answer it.
answer the phone.
no.  tell me what you want to say.
answer it.
okay.  okay.  hold that thought just for a second.  they only call me when it's an emergency.  just hold that thought.  can you call back?
oh my g-d, they want me to anchor.  they want me to anchor tonight!
that's good.
yeah.
well, that's great.
okay.  that is great.  but i can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
no.  go ahead.  you're gonna be great.
no.  no, listen to me here.  i want to know what you're talking about.  you know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
i'll tell you tonight.  let's do it tonight.  as soon as you get back we'll talk.  we'll talk.
promise?
i promise.  we'll talk.  you'll be great.  you'll be fine.  go ahead, just imagine that, uh... just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me.
yeah.  i'll do that.  as long as you're not patronizing me.
patronizing you... nay, i love you.
i love you.
okay, til tonight.
tonight.
you promise?
yeah.  i promise.
okay.  and you know what, i'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...how's that... would that be a good thing.
yeah, yeah.  good thing.
okay.
see you later.  good luck.
thank you.
don't be late.
the men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
so...the station is empty?
yeah.  this way.
you considered becoming a prostitute?
yes, i considered it.
did you ever turn tricks before?
no.
what about back home?
no.
i came here.  i had no money.  i knew no one.  i couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. they approached me - i could've made a lot of money.  i considered it, but... it's not who i am.  they pay me below the table at ludwig's.
so you were never a prostitute?
what are you asking me?
i'm just trying to find out who you are.
i'm not a whore.  i'm not a whore.
i know.
you don't know.  i'm sorry.  i was desperate.  that's not me.  i shot a cop.  can you imagine what they'll do to me when i got to prison?
they're not gonna send you right back.
i'm sorry.  i didn't mean to...i'm glad. actually i'm glad it's over.  all this time.  hiding.  never being able to look anyone in the eyes. always afraid that someone would find out who i was.  never trusting anyone...
what is it?
the video of milos and tamina - i told you to erase it.
i did.
and the whore's murder?  you didn't erase that either, did you?  don't lie, i won't be angry.
why not?
put the camera down, oleg.
what is that?
what does it look like?  it's an address book!
let me get a shot of it.
sit down!
this way.  hold it this way.  good.
hey, chief, what are you doing here?
i came to see how the investigation was going.  i called and you're not here.  i wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  i beep you - you don't return my call.  where the hell have you been?!
ladder 20 was on the rock for training. we stopped there... so she could get cleaned up.
what do you mean, 'cleaned up?'
i let her take a shower.
a shower!?  did you take one, too?
no!  nothing happened.
oh really.  that's nice.  you took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  are you out of your fucking mind??  are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?!
oh.
it was my decision, not his.
well, i'm the deputy chief fire marshall and every now and then i'd like to be included in decisions.
look, after jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  how about that? the case is all yours.
oh yeah...?  alright.
i'm ready to be briefed.  excuse us.
yeah, sure.  beep me when you're ready for the press conference.
look, eddie, i'm tellin' you - i didn't touch her.
well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
i took her there for a shower and that's it.
just a shower?
yeah, just her in the shower.  nothing happened.  look, i'm sure you probably think i'm a fool and i fucked up, but...
no, i don't think you were a fool, i just think you were stupid about it.  i mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  you don't know her well enough. she's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  you can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. you're dead.
i told you, you know, i thought i was doing the right thing, you know, i think she's innocent.
well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  don't you understand, that's why you're a professional.
but, i mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  i mean, you shoulda heard her there.  tellin' her whole story...i believed her.
how you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an immigration lawyer.  here, here's a number of an immigration lawyer.  that's how you help her. but you can't get involved in her like that.  you're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  and lemme give you another piece of advice.  maybe you don't watch tv but i'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  and when you get out there, they know your face.  and the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that i get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  and i get more done because of it.
why'd you help me back there with the chief?  why'd you stand up for me like that?
you know, i don't know.  i like you. you remind me of a puppy i used to have. he pissed on the rug all the time, but i still kept him.
so...who's nicky?
what do you want?
your opinion.  you see, they going to make a movie about me, too, eddie.  and write books.
what's your accomplishment.
i kill someone famous.
then do it, asshole.
good - be tough to the end.  actor who plays you will want to die like hero.
so tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  they going to have real movie this time.
if you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
no.  we are insane.  who else but crazy men would film their murders?  so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. but what good is money there?  because once in hospital i say i not crazy. just pretended to be acquitted.  we see psychiatrists.  they must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called?  oh - i got it.  because of your double jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  we come out free, rich and famous!
good idea!
you really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  how fuckin' stupid are you?
smarter than americans.  you're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  not only will americans believe me, they'll cry for me.  so...detective eddie flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your nicolette? maybe you can propose to her now?
okay.  he has nothing to say.  start the camera!
cut!
i know.
what do you mean you know?  he told you he was gonna propose to me?
well, he...
i want to hear everything he said.
i'm trying to tell you.
alright.  go ahead.
that morning.  he was talking to me and leon about marriage.
oh my g-d.  we were having lunch here. he started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but i got a call to anchor - and i walked out on him.  i walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
robert...?
what are you doing here?
you've got a call.
i can't talk to anybody right now, can't you see i'm busy!  i can't talk business.  hang up.  have a drink.  get her a whiskey.
trust me, you'll want to take this call.
come to 45 broadway.  don't bring the police.  come alone or you'll be in my next film.
look asshole.  i've been threatened by better than you.
no.  i'm the best that's ever threatened you.
i'll meet you on one condition - i get exclusivity and you surrender to me.
we'll talk about that.  four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  three hundred thousand dollars.
what?  it doesn't work that way.
if you don't want my film - i'll call another show.  and they will show it.
wait a minute.  wait a minute.
come alone.  bring cash.  and we'll talk about surrendering.
how was it?
not good.
did the d.a. videotape her deposition?
yeah.  he finished awhile ago.
alright.  swing by her apartment.  let her pick up her clothes and take her straight to hoover street.  you got that?
yeah.
chief - mind if i take her?
okay.  but not water sports.
are you alright?
i still can't believe eddie's gone.
i'm sorry.
is he your boyfriend?
ludwig?  he's gay - are you jealous?
if i was your boyfriend, i might be.
if you were my boyfriend, i'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
a good immigration lawyer could stall the process.  eddie recommended one.
no matter what happens...i'm glad i met you.
i'm glad i met you.
you better get packed.
right.
do you have coffee?
in the kitchen.
i'll make some for us.
i'll get my clothes.
what are you doing?
pouring it out!
get outta here!
what the hell happened?
they were inside.  they booby trapped her apartment!
viewer discretion advised!
you want the tape?  there it is!
you are success story?  i am success story!  why do you say i and not we?
oleg, don't be paranoid.  you got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  i gave you half of what they gave me.  look - here we are!
in movie they make of us, who do you think would act me?
the one who got caught in the bathroom.  george michael.
i'm serious.
shut up.  look!
this is my project.  i say 'action.'  i am the director!  you are the talent. you wait for me to say 'action.'  and 'action!'
bad last moment - i cut it out.
i told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape!
be quiet.  watch.
why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director?
because i am the director.  don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now.
your idea?  i thought it was my idea.
i'm serious...this - this is a great american film.  full of violence and sex.  and i want my credit.
credit?
yes.  before we hand in the next video - i put titles on it and my credit is going to read - directed by oleg razgul.
yes.  but there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - i don't share credit.
you got that?
no, i don't get that!
you think you are a director?  you are a fucking little, small russian piece of shit.  and i hate you.  i fucking hate you.
are you my attorney?  i'm emil.  i'm insane.
i'm not your lawyer until i see the money.
here.  i have your money.
oh no!  no!  shit!
emil.  take it easy.  stay with me.  sit down.  what do you need?  what are you looking for?
he has the camera!  he took the movie!
don't say anything.
where are we going?
i'm coming with you.
yes.  yes, come with me!
i'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  i'm coming with him.
i'll take him.
no way!  he's mine!
we're takin' him.  don't argue!
he's my collar!
well, he killed my partner!
he's yours but i take him in!  i'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but i'm walkin' him in.
and you, you'll pay for what you did!
this footage will work in your favor. when the jury sees this - no matter what cutler tries, they'll convict him.
you outta be ashamed.  ashamed of yourself.
if i didn't put it on somebody else would!  i was his friend!
don't give me that fucking shit.
were you a fireman?  that how you knew how to rig the apartment?
my father was.  he gave me many lessons about fire.  now it's my friend.
tommy, take a walk.
what are you gonna do?
don't you get it?  he knew he was gonna get caught!  that's why he videotaped eddie's murder - he thinks he's gonna get off.
don't stoop to his level!
take the car.  get outta here, tommy.
look, you can't shoot him in cold blood.
get outta here now!!  get in that car and drive away!!!  do what i say or i'll kill you, too!!!
you can't kill me.  you're not a cop. just fireman with a gun.  i bet you never shot anybody in your life.
you'll be my first.
c'mon.  pull the trigger.  do it.  oh, look, you're sweating.  you don't have the balls.
get down on your knees.
where's your partner?
the sheraton!  on broadway!  room 210. go get oleg.  he'll kill you.
i brought you some letters.  it's really fan mail.  women mostly.  one wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. another wants a check.
you bring the cigarettes?
oh, sure.
...delusions and paranoia.
i was all of these.
well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  no question about that.
what about oleg?
disappeared.  they're looking everywhere.  maybe he went back to czechoslovakia.
no, he is here.  shit...
don't worry about him.  think about yourself.
what about my movie rights?  book rights?
look, i haven't really focused on that kind of thing.
what's your cut?  how much?
i would say...half.  half is fair.
no.  no way.
but it's...
thirty-percent.  no more.  or i call another lawyer.  this is the biggest case of your life.  don't try to negotiate.  thirty percent.  say yes or no.
this is not about money, emil.  i need your trust in me.
what else do you need?
i need to know about your background.  i need to know about your upbringing.  why you're here.
give me another one, please.
tell me about yourself.  what you did as a young boy... what your parents were like.
my father always degraded me.  killed my self-esteem.  and my mother was blind.
your mother was blind?
yeah, she went blind giving birth to me. she went to fucking black market doctor to induce me.
back in the czech republic?
yeah, yeah...bad doctor gave her bad drugs which made her go blind.  and my father blamed me for her blindness...
your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
yeah, he hated me from day when i was born.  put it out.  can you put the cigarette out?
that's what he did to me.  he put cigarettes out on me.
your father put cigarettes out on you?
out on my back when i was a small boy.
can i see your back?
i'm abused.  don't you think?
i don't think it's abuse, i think it's torture.
the public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  this is going to be our rodney king!
what was i supposed to do?  the guy tried to mug me.  i was gonna send a cop back - i just forgot.
forgot?  you handcuffed a civilian to a tree?!
chief - i know i screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian.
well this is gonna end your career and probably mine.
end my career?
how are you going to fight this?  maybe if oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  you'd have the good to weight against the bad! it's unfortunate that i have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing i can do!  gimme your shield.
but chief?  over this??
there's nothing to talk about.  get a good lawyer.  you're suspended until your trial.
forget about me.  you have enough problems of your own.
...do you really want me to forget about you?
i don't want to drag you down with me.
daphne, i...
...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital...
officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him!
traitor!!
no.  you are the traitor.  you are murderer.  i am director.  action!
tell him to put his gun down!
let her go!  let her go!!
if he doesn't lower his gun i'll fucking kill her.
