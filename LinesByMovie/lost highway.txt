you don't mind that i'm not coming tonight?
what are you going to do?
i thought i'd stay home and read.
it's nice to know i can still make you laugh.
i like to laugh, fred.
that's why i married you.
wake me up when you get home.
what's that?
a videotape.
who's it from?
i don't know... there's no return address on the envelope... in fact, there's no address on it.
does it say anything on the tape?
no, nothing.
it must be from a real estate agent.
maybe.
good book, huh?
huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
same one you were reading the other night?
what night?
when you didn't come to the club.
oh. oh, yeah. no. this is a different one.
i called, you know.
called? when?
from the club. you didn't answer.
i must have fallen asleep. i was asleep when you got home, wasn't i?
you were asleep when i got home, yes.
i had a dream about you last night...
yeah?
you were in the house... calling my name... but i couldn't find you.
you're up early.
that dog woke me. i lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
who the hell owns that dog?
what's that? another tape?
yes, i just found it on the step.
don't you want to watch it?
i guess so.
we've got to call the police.
all right.
so?
two detectives are coming out.
that's it.
let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
very strange.
what is?
the angle. the high angle shot on the tape.
how'd the camera get so high like that?
and smooth... almost no movement - back and forth, i mean.
like you'd get if it was hand held.
right... this just glided along.
do you always sleep here?... in this room?... both of you?
this is our bedroom.
there's no other bedroom?
no... there is, i mean, i use it as a practice room... it's soundproofed.
you're a musician?
yes, i thought my wife...
what's your axe?
tenor... tenor saxophone. do you...
tone deaf.
do you own a video camera?
no. fred hates them.
i like to remember things my own way.
what do you mean by that?
how i remember them. not necessarily the way they happened.
why not?
it kept going off for some reason. false alarms.
might be a good time to try using it again.
anybody else have a key to the house.
no.
maid? relative?
no, one of us is always here to let the maid in. nobody else has a key.
we'll keep a watch on the house.
as best we can.
if anything else happens, you'll call us.
we will.
thanks, guys.
what the hell is going on?!
i wish i knew.
what was that?!!!
what?
on the tape! there was something else on the tape.
you don't remember being awakened? it looks like you were aware of someone.
or something.
no, i don't remember anything. it looks like i... but... i don't remember.
why would anyone do something like this?
has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
or not so recently?
we'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
i don't know if i want to stay here. i don't feel safe.
where would you feel safe?
i don't know. maybe a hotel.
did you use the alarm system since we were here last?
the first night... not the last two.
why not?
i forgot. anyway, i hate the idea of acting paranoid.
i'll make sure the alarm is set from now on.
but that doesn't solve the problem. who is doing this? and why?
we've met before, haven't we?
i don't think so. where was it that you think we've met?
at your house. don't you remember?
no, no i don't. are you sure?
of course. in fact, i'm there right now.
what do you mean? you're where right now?
at your house.
that's absurd.
i thought you were getting me a drink?
just a minute.
andy, who is that guy?
i don't know his name. he's a friend of dick laurent's, i think.
dick laurent?
yes, i believe so.
but dick laurent is dead, isn't he?
he is? i didn't think you knew dick. how do you know he's dead?
i don't. i don't know him.
dick can't be dead. who told you he was dead?
let's go home.
but...
now! we're leaving now! i didn't want to come here in the first place.
it was a long time ago... i met him at this place called moke's... we... became friends... he told me about a job...
what job?
i don't remember... anyway, andy's okay...
he's got some fucked up friends.
i told you to stay in the car!
why? what is it? why did you make me wait out here?
i thought there might be somebody inside.
was there?
no... of course not.
did you see that about the guy who chopped up his wife into a million pieces?
how could i miss it? the tv won't quit with that stuff.
they're gonna cook him.
andy's from utah. he says there you have a choice... you can die by hanging or by firing squad.
which would you choose?
andy would go for this, don't you think?... firing squad, definitely.
do they aim for the head or for the heart?
the heart, i guess.
i wouldn't... the brain would know what's going on. your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. savage pain, marian.
something wrong?
my... my head.
headache, huh? too much sun, i guess. you want to come in?  still got forty- five minutes outside if you want it.
no, no. i want to go in.
what's bothering you, madison?
the pain is getting worse. i need more aspirin.
i can't give you anymore. i'll talk to the doctor.
what is it?
aspirin... fly head. i gotta have more aspirin.
the doctor said not to give you anything. you can see him in the morning.
but my head...
now, mack, what's the situation?
i'm not entirely certain, captain. you'll have to see for yourself.
that's not fred madison?
no, sir, it's not.
who is it?
i couldn't say, sir... captain henderson?
yeah, mack?
captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
repeat that, bill.
warden, it's not him. it was not fred madison in that cell.
of course, it's madison!!! who else could it be?
i don't know. the guards say they've never seen him before.
where is he now?
he's in the infirmary, being examined.
did you ask him who he is?
he... he can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
if he's not madison, then where's madison?
i've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
what is this, rogoff?
i don't know yet.
who is this man?
he's just been fingerprinted, and i'll run these blood tests right away. we'll find out soon enough.
he's not madison?
not even close.
i examined madison last night, marshall. he had a headache.
a headache?
i did a routine once-over, and gave him a sleeping pill. i've never seen this man before. neither have the guards. i don't think he's in the system.
how about madison? have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
nothing, marsh. vanished. there's an apb out on him. his photo's been faxed nationwide.
one of the guards must have leaked it.
what's the word on the street?
a cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named fred madison.
the wife killer?
yes.
his condition? what do you mean?
his physical condition.
same as always. pete takes care of himself.
i wouldn't know how.
you say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
when he went to work, right.
what about yesterday?
he didn't come home.
i want to see him.
yes, and we need to talk to him... if we can.  mel, let's get peter in here.
pete, can you tell us now, anything about this?
pete, what happened to you?
have you made any charges against him?
no.
then he's coming home with his mother and me.
all right... but you see our predicament... legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  for now, he's free to leave.
you just gonna let him go?
we'll get a tail put on him.
just rest easy, pete. you're gonna be okay.
are you hungry, honey? i'll fix you something.
no... i don't feel so good. i would like some aspirin.
coming up.
now we'll see what this son of a bitch is up to.
yeah.
where's pete?
out in back.
you talk to him?
no... here he comes.
better.

i... i didn't say anything...
i won't ever tailgate.
do you know how many fuckin' car lengths it takes to stop a car at 35 m.p.h.?
no.
six fuckin' car lengths... that's about a hundred and six fuckin' feet, mister! you were following ten feet behind me... if i'd had to stop suddenly, you would have hit me. i want you to get a driver's manual, and i want you to study that motherfucker... and i want you to obey the god damn rules. fifty fuckin' thousand people were killed on the road last year.  cause of fuckin' assholes like you. tell me you're gonna get a manual.
i'll get a manual.  and study it.
fuckin' "a".
sorry about that, pete, but tailgating is one thing i can't tolerate.
i can see that.
i'll bet you know how many car lengths it takes to stop at... say 45 m.p.h.
eight, nine car lengths. a hundred and sixty-two feet.
at sixty?
fifteen car lengths. about two hundred and seventy feet.
what'd i tell ya.
thanks, mr. eddy.
no... thank you!... i'll be bringin' the "caddy" by tomorrow.

we saw you that night, pete.
you came home. your friend sheila brought you here.
sheila?
yes, there was a man with you... she brought you here... she didn't know what else to do.

i'm sure you noticed that girl that was with me the other day... good lookin' blonde? she stayed in the car?...
her name is alice. you know i love that girl to death. if i ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, i'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... then you know what?...
what?
i'd pull the trigger and shoot him right between the eyes.
hello.
meet me at the starlight motel on sycamore... i'll be there in twenty minutes.
okay.
he'll kill us.
are you positive he knows?
i'm not positive... but... he knows.

what's he do?
he makes films for mr. eddy.
pornos.
yeah.
how'd you get in with these fuckin' people?
pete... don't...
how'd it happen, alice?
it was a long time ago... i met someone at this place called moke's... we became friends. he told me about a job...
in pornos?
no... a job... i didn't know what. he set up an appointment for me to see a man.
you liked it.
if you want me to go away, i'll go away.
so, should i call andy?
andy?
that's his name... andy. our ticket out of here.
yeah. call him.
i'll set it up for tomorrow night. you'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... don't drive there... take a bus... make sure no one follows you... his address is easy to remember... it's 2224 deep dell place... it's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... i'll be upstairs with andy... the back door will be open... that leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... at eleven fifteen, i'll ask andy to fix me a drink... when he does, you can crack him in the head... okay?
okay...
lemme call him now. make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.

oh, yeah?... what else?

mr. eddy?
yeah... how ya doin', pete?
okay.
you're doin, okay?  that's good, pete.
look... it's late, mr. eddy... i ...
i'm really glad you're doin' okay, pete.
you sure you're doin' okay? everything all right?
yeah.
that's good, pete. hey... i want you to talk to a friend of mine.
i don't think so. where was it that you think we've met?
at your house. don't you remember?
no. no, i don't.
we just killed a couple of people...
what?
what's goin' on?
great question!! in the east... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... this uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? it's been a pleasure talking to you.
you got him.
alice, i...
you all right?
we killed him.
you killed him.
alice?
alice...
we gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
where's the bathroom?
up the stairs - down the hall.
look at all this shit... i know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car...  we can go anywhere.
alice?
where's alice?
alice who?
we've got pete dayton's prints all over this place.
you know what i think?
what's that, ed?
there's no such thing as a bad coincidence.
