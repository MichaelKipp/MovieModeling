the evil eye does not work on me.
mother sister, you have been talkin' 'bout me the last eighteen years. what have i ever done to you?
you are a drunk fool.
besides that.  da mayor do not bother nobody.  nobody do not bother da mayor but you.  da mayor just mind his business.  i love everybody. i even love you.
hold your tongue.  you do not have that much love.
one day you will be nice to me.  we might both be dead and buried, but you will be nice.  at least civil.
you a dumb-ass simple motherfucker. where did you read that?
do not worry about it.  but when it happens and I am in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, do not ask me to throw you a lifesaver either.
fool, you are thirty cents away from a quarter.  how you going to get a boat?
do not worry about it.
you are raggedy as a roach.  you eat the holes out of donuts.
I will be back on my feet.  soon enough.
so when is all this ice suppose to melt?
how much?
you come in here at least three times a day.  you a retard?  a buck fifty.
damn, sal, put some more cheese on that motherfucker.
extra cheese is two dollars. y'know dat.
two dollars!  forget it!
mookie.
what?
how come you am not got no brothers up?
ask sal.
sal, how come you am not got no brothers up on the wall here?
take it easy, pop.
do not start on me today.
sal, that might be fine, you own this, but rarely do i see any italian americans eating in here. all I have ever seen is black folks. so since we spend much money here, we do have some say.
you a troublemaker?
do not come back, either.
boycott sal's.  boycott sal's.
buggin' out, i got to work here.
I am cool.  I am cool.
come back in a week, it will be squashed.
mookie, if your friends can not behave, they are not welcome.
i got no say over people.
you talk to 'em.
people are free to do what they wanna do.
mookie.
gotta go.
c'mere, doctor.
doctor, this is da mayor talkin'.
ok.  ok.
doctor, always try to do the right thing.
that is it?
that is it.
jade, you are late.
i know, mother sister, but I am here now.  where is the stuff?
this might take some time.
i got nowhere to go.  we have not had a good sit-down for a long while.
tender-headed runs in my family. you tender-headed?
yeah, me too.
that is why i do not fool with it. only let you touch it...ouch!
sorry, comb got caught.
be gentle, child.  mother sister is an old woman.
how are you holding up in this weather?
I will do.
i do not know why you still have not bought an air conditioner.
do not like 'em.  a fan will do.
i did not know you had such beautiful hair.
fool, there is a lot in this world you do not know.
I am not stopping.  I am on my way.
you are too cruel to da mayor, it is not right.
I am not studying no mayor.  besides, he reminds me of my least favorite peoples.  my tenants and my ex- husband--goddamn-bless his soul.
number one: i got some jive, late- rent-paying trifling negroes in this house.  every year i keep threatening to sell it.
and move to long island...
and move to long island.  number two: my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build a black business empire.  needless to say what happened, this house is it, all i got.  I am too through with yar people.
whew!
mookie, what took you so long?  i got a business to run.
run it then.
pop, I am going to go with mookie.
good, make sure he do not jerk around.
mister seor love daddy is cool.
ya like him, huh?
yeah.
y'know, vito, i know pino is ya brother and shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you should "house him." kick his ass.
i do not know.
if you do not make a stand, he is going to be beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life.
that is what you think?
that is what i think.
i do not like to fight.
c'mon, do not be shy.  mmm, smells good.  this is ya love daddy talkin' to ya, starvin' like marvin. say something, mookie.
mister seor love daddy, I would like to dedicate the next record to my heart, tina.
alright.  let me play this record while i go to work on my chicken parmigiana hero with extra cheese and extra sauce.
here ya are.  keep the change.
that is right on time.  this is my friend, vito.  his pops is sal.
tell ya father he makes the best heros in brooklyn.
I will do that.
we are outta here.
you the man.
you the man.
no, you the man.
no.  I am just a struggling black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.
yo!
yes?
you almost knocked me down.  the word is "excuse me."
excuse me.  I am very sorry.
not only did you knock me down, you stepped on my new white air jordans that i just bought and that is all you can say, "excuse me?"
I will fuck you up quick two times.
who told you to step on my sneakers? who told you to walk on my side of the block?  who told you to be in my neighborhood?
i own a brownstone on this block.
who told you to buy a brownstone on my block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street?
what do you want to live in a black neighborhood for?  motherfuck gentrification.
I am under the assumption that this is a free country and one can live where he pleases.
I am going to leave now.
if i was not a righteous black man you would be in serious trouble. serious.
i should have vito go with you all the time.
yeah, no more ninety-minute deliveries around the corner.
pino, i work hard like everybody in here.
he is right.
c'mere.  do not get too friendly with da mook.
that is going to be the last time you hit vito.
smack him back.
what?
remember what i said.
as i was saying before we were so rudely interrupted by the finest.
what was you saying?
motherfucker was not saying shit.
look at that.
it is a fucking shame.
what is?
sweet dick willie.
that is my name.
do i have to spell it out?
make it plain.
ok, but listen up.  I am going to break it down.
let it be broke.
can ya dig it?
it is dug.
look at those korean motherfuckers across the street.  i betcha they have not been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place.
it is been about a year.
a motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that had been boarded up for longer than i care to remember and I have been here a long time.
how long?
too long!  too long.  now for the life of me, i have not been able to figger this out.  either dem koreans are geniuses or we blacks are dumb.
it is miller time.  let me go give these koreans s'more business.
it is a motherfucking shame.
eddie lovell.
how old are you?
ten.
what makes sammy run?
my name is eddie.
what makes sammy run?
i said my name is eddie lovell.
relax, eddie, i want you to go to the corner store.  how much will it cost me?
how would i know how much it is going to cost if i do not know what I am buying?
eddie, you are too smart for your own britches.  listen to me.  how much do you want to run to the store for da mayor?
fifty cents.
you got a deal.
i know i have not seen you in four days.  I am a working man.
i work too, but i still make time.
tina, what do you want me to do?
i want you to spend some time with me.  i want you to try and make this relationship work.  if not, I would rather not be bothered.
alright.  alright.  I will be over there sometime today.
when?
before i get off work.
bring some ice cream, I am burning up.  do you love me?
do i love you?
mookie, get offa da phone.
be off in a second.  tina, i dedicated a record on mister seor love daddy's show to you.
mookie!  how is anybody gonna call in?
big deal?  if that is not love, i do not know what is.
you deaf or what?
gotta go.  see ya soon.  everybody happy now?
sal's famous pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas, pepperoni and anchovies, hold on...  see, pop, mookie fucking talking on the phone and people are trying to call in orders.  he is making us lose business.
mookie, you are fucking up.
twenty minutes.  how come you niggers are so stupid?
fuck you and stay off the phone.
forget it, mookie.
who is your favorite basketball player?
magic johnson.
and not larry bird?  who is your favorite movie star?
eddie murphy.
pino, no joke.  c'mon, answer.
it is prince.  he is a prince freak.
shut up.  the boss!  bruuucce!!!!
sounds funny to me.  as much as you say nigger this and nigger that, all your favorite people are "niggers."
pino, i think secretly that you wish you were black.  that is what i think.  vito, what do you say?
y'know, I have been listening and reading 'bout farrakhan, ya did not know that, did you?
i did not know you could read.
fuck you.  anyway, minister farrakhan always talks about the so-called "day" when the black man will rise.  "we will one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past."  you really believe that shit?
it is e-vit-able.
keep dreaming.
fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck frank sinatra, too.
well, fuck you, too, and fuck michael jordan.
dago, wop, garlic-breath, guinea, pizza-slinging, spaghetti-bending, vic damone, perry como, luciano pavarotti, sole mio, nonsinging motherfucker.
you gold-teeth, gold-chain-wearing, fried-chicken-and-biscuit-eatin', monkey, ape, baboon, big thigh, fast-running, three-hundred-sixty- degree-basketball-dunking spade moulan yan.
sal, can you do me a favor?
depends.
can you pay me now?
can not do.
sal, just this once, do me that solid.
you know you do not get paid till we close tonight.  we are still open.
i would like to get paid now.
tonight, when we close.
whaddup.  money?
i was going to buy a slice.
I will be back after i make this delivery.
on the rebound.
that is the dope.
i just copped them.  let me tell you the story of right-hand--left- hand--the tale of good and evil.
I am listening.
hate!
brother, mookie, if i love you i love you, but if i hate you...
i understand.
i love you, my brother.
i love you, black.
turn it off.
mister radio raheem, i can not even hear myself think.  you are disturbing me and you are disturbing my customers.
jade.
I am in here.
how come you are not at sal's?
I am working.
is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
i just come home to take a quick shower.
sal's going to be mad.
later for sal.  y'know, sometimes i think you are more concerned with him than me.
i think no such a thing.  sal pays you, you should work.
slavery days are over.  my name am not kunta kinte.  sis, i do not want to argue, stop pressing me.
i just do not want you to lose the one job you have been able to keep, that is all.  I am carrying you as it is.
do not worry 'bout me.  i always get paid.
yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
what responsibilities?
i did not stutter.  take care of your responsibilities.  y'know exactly what I am talking about.
pop, i think we should sell this place, get outta here while we are still ahead...and alive.
since when do you know what is best for us?
could not we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
too many pizzerias already there.
then we could try something else.
we do not know nuthin' else.
I am sick of niggers, it is a bad neighborhood.  i do not like being around them, they are animals.
some are ok.
my friends laugh at me all the time, laugh right in my face, tell me go feed the moulies.
i did not think so.
pop, what else can i say?  i do not wanna be here, they do not want us here.  we should stay in our own neighborhood, stay in bensonhurst.
so what if this is a black neighborhood, so what if we are a minority.  I have never had no trouble with dese people, do not want none either, so do not start none.  this is america.  sal's famous pizzeria is here for good. you think you know it all?  well, you don't.  I am your father, you better remember that.
hurry up and get dressed.
I am coming.
I am going with you.
no!
no!
it is so nice to see a family hanging out together.
we are not hanging out.  I am being escorted back to work.
that is not even true.  i just want a slice.
jade, you do not know this, but I am organizing a boycott of sal's famous pizzeria.
what did he do this time?
y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the wall of fame?
so?
have you noticed something about them?
no.
yo, I am gone.
I will see ya there.
every single one of those pictures is somebody italian.
and?
and i--we--want some black people up.
did you ask sal?
yeah, i asked him.  i do not want nobody in there, nobody spending good money in sal's.  he should get no mo' money from the community till he puts some black faces up on that motherfucking wall.
buggin' out, i do not mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
so, in other words, you are not down.
I am down, but for a worthwhile cause.
jade, i still love you.
you are going to be in the street with the rest of your homeboys.
'bout time, pop.
pop, stop lying.
shaddup!  jade, what can i fix you?
twenty "d" duracells.
twenty "c" duracells.
d, not c.
c duracell.
d!  d!  d!  you dumb motherfucker. learn how to speak english first.  d.
how many you say?
twenty!  motherfucker!  twenty!
motherfucker you.
what can you say?
i do not know how he does it.
ml?
what?
ml, hold this for me.
why you got to talk 'bout my moms?
nobody talkin' 'bout ya moms.
i did not say nobody, i said you.
sweet dick, i did not mean it like that.
yes you did.
squash it.
i just wanted to know who named ya sweet dick willie?
ml stands for ml.  that is it.
naw, that is some stupid shit.  now you know how i got that name.
negroes kill me, always holdin' onto, talkin' 'bout their dicks.
I will see you out.
see ya around.
jade, i do not want you coming in here no mo'.
stop tripping.
no, you are tripping.  do not come in sal's.  alright, read my lips.
what are you so worked up about?
over sal, the way he talks and the way he looks at you.
he is just being nice.
nice!
he is completely innocent.
innocent!
i did not stutter.  you heard me.
you should see the way he looks at you.  all sal wants to do is hide the salami.
you are too crude.
i might be, but you are not welcome here.
stop trying to play big brother. I am a grown woman.  you got to lotta nerve.  mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you are going to tell me what to do.  come off it.
one has nuthin' to do with the other.
oh, it doesn't, huh!  you got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
I am getting paid...
...peanuts.
pretty soon I will be making a move.
i truly hope so.  I am tired of supporting a grown man.
that was a foolish act, but it was brave.  that chile owes you his life.
i was not trying to be a hero.  i saw what was about to happen and i reacted, did not even think.  if i did, i might not have done it in second thought.  da mayor is an old man, have not run that fast in years.
i went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, august 1, 1939, snow hill, alabama.  maybe i should be heroic more often.
maybe you shouldn't.  do not get happy.  this changes nothing between you and me.  you did a good thing and mother sister wanted to thank you for it.
i thank you.
you are welcome.
sal, i do not care if you fire me this exact minute, leave my sister alone.
mookie, i do not know what you are talking about, plus i do not want to hear it.
sal, just do me a favor, leave jade alone.
here, you gotta delivery.
yeah, do you know 'em?
no, just checking.
delivery from sal's famous pizzeria.
what took you so long?  is it hot?
hot.  hot.
come in then.
tina, you are too slick.
how else was i going to get you here?  i have not seen you in a week.
I have been working hard, getting paid.
where is the ice cream?  the hagen- dazs butter pecan?
shit!  i forgot.
your memory is really getting bad.
i just forgot.
and i really wanted some ice cream too.
i can run out and get it.
no!  no!  you will not come back either.
i can not be staying long anyway.
how long then?
long enough for us to do the nasty.
that is out.  no!  it is too hot! you think I am going to let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
a quickie is good every once in a blue moon.
you a blue-moon fool.
then we will do something else.
what else?
trust me.
trust you?  because of trusting you we have a son.  remember your son?
trust me.
I am going to take off ya clothes.
mookie, i told you already it is too fucking hot to make love.
why you gotta curse?
I am sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
no rawness.
tina, you are sweating.
of course I am sweating.  I am burning up.  it is hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
lie down, please.
it is cold.
it is 'pose to be cold.
later for you.
meda.  meda.
what?
tina, you do not have a forehead, you got a eight-head.
feels good.
yes, yes, lord.  is not this better than haagen-dazs butter pecan ice cream?
sal, if you want me to deliver any faster, get me a jet rocket or something, cuz i can not run with pizzas, all the cheese ends up on one side and shit.
i did not say nuthin'.  you must have a guilty conscience.  what are you guilty of?
I am not guilty of nuthin'.
you must be guilty of something or you would have never come in saying the things you said.
c'mon, sal.
where we goin'?
i know this.
i love you.
I am listening.
good.  i want you to listen.
jesus christ on the cross, i said I am listening.
good.  vito, you trust that mook too much.  so does pop.
mookie's ok.
you listening to me?
stop busting my balls.  i said I am listening ten fucking times already.
mookie is not to be trusted.  no moulan yan can be trusted.  the first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.  in the back.
how do you know this?
i know.
you really think so?
i know so.  he, them, they are not to be trusted.
so what do you want me to do?
be on guard.  mookie has pop conned already, so we have to look out for him.
i like mookie a lot.
and that is exactly what I am talkin' 'bout.
vito!  pino!  let's go.
be right there, pop.  listen to what i said.
how you be?
i be.  I am living large.
is that the only tape you got?
you do not like public enemy?  it is the dope shit.
i like 'em, but you do not play anything else.
i do not like anything else.
check this out.  y'know sal's.
yeah, i know dat motherfucker.
I am trying to organize a boycott of sal's pizza joint.  ya see what I am saying?
i almost had to yoke him this afternoon.  tell me, tell me, radio raheem, to turn my music down. did not even say please.  who the fuck he think he is?  don corleone and shit.
he makes all his money off us black people and i do not see nuthin' but italians all up in there, sylvester stallone and motherfuckers.  ya see what I am saying, homeboy?
talk to me.
we should not buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.
that is what I am talkin' 'bout. that is what I am talkin' 'bout.
you got my back.
ya back is got.
my brother.
my brother.
what did i tell ya 'bout dat noise?
what did i tell ya 'bout dem pictures?
what da fuck!  are you deaf?
no, are you?  we want some black people up on the wall of fame.
turn that jungle music off.  we am not in africa.
why it gotta be about jungle music and africa?
it is about turning that shit off and getting the fuck outta my pizzeria.
korea man is ok.  let's leave him alone.
him no white.  him no white.
wake up!
fuck!  my money!
where are you going?
to get my money.
mookie, you must think I am stupid or something.  you are going to run outta here and i will not see your black ass for another week.
tina, it is not like that.
you do not care about me and you definately do not care 'bout your son.
tina, I will be right back.
be a man.
i am a man.
act like one then.  be a man.
later.
you are to the curb.  you better step off.  get a life.
good morning.
is it a good morning?
yes indeed.  you almost got yourself killed last night.
I have done that before.
where did you sleep?
i didn't.
i hope the block is still standing.
we are still standing.
whatdafuck do you want?
i wants my money.  i wants to get paid.
mookie, i always liked you.  not the smartest kid, but you are honest. do not make me dislike you.
sal, i want my money.
do not even ask about your money. your money would not even pay for that window you smashed.
motherfuck a window, radio raheem is dead.
you are right, a kid is dead, but mook, this is not the time.
fuck dat.  the time is fuckin' now. y'know I am sorry 'bout sal's famous pizzeria, but i got to live, too. i got to get paid.
we both do.
we all know you are going to get over with the insurance money anyway! ya know da deal.
do we now?
quit bullshitting.
you do not know shit about shit.
how much?  how much do i owe you?
my salary.  two-fifty.
ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone.
you only pay me two-fifty a week.  i owe you fifty bucks.

you keep it.
christmas came early.
it is supposed to be even hotter today.
