you guys know my cousin mikey sullivan?
yeah.
well you know how he loves animals right? anyway, last week he's drivin' home...
what? come on!
i'm sorry, 'cause you know mikey, the fuckin guy loves animals, and this is the last person you'd want this to happen to.
chuckie, what the fuck happened?
okay. he's driving along and this fuckin' cat jumps in front of his car, and so he hits this cat--
--that isn't funny--
--and he's like "shit! motherfucker!" and he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- i'm sorry--
it's walkin' pretty slow at this point.
you guys are fuckin' sick.
jesus.
and all the time he's apologizin' to the cat, goin' "i'm sorry." bang, "i'm sorry." bang!
yeah, so he's like "check the front of my truck, i can prove i hit it 'cause there's probably some blood or something"--
--or a tail--
will!
and so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
stop brushin' me back!
stop crowdin the plate!
casey's bouncin' at a bar up harvard. we should go there sometime.
what are we gonna do up there?
i don't know, we'll fuck up some smart kids.  you'd prob'ly fit right in.
fuck you.
excuse me, professor lambeau?
yes.
i'm in your applied theories class. we're all down at the math and science building.
it's saturday.
i know. we just couldn't wait 'till monday to find out.
find out what?
who proved the theorem.
yah, that is a nice ass.
you could put a pool in that backyard.
who's she talking to?
that fuckin' guinea, will knows him.
fuck this, let's get something to eat...
what morgan, you're not gonna go talk to her?
fuck her.
i could go for a whopper.
let's hit "kelly's."
morgan, i'm not goin' to "kelly's roast beef" just cause you like the take-out girl. it's fifteen minutes out of our way. morgan what else we gonna do we can't spare fifteen minutes?
all right morgan, fine. i'll tell you why we're not going to "kelly's." it's because the take-out bitch is a fuckin' idiot. i'm sorry you like her but she's dumb as a post and she has never got our order right, never once.
she's not stupid.
she's sharp as a marble.
we're not goin'.  i don't even like "kelly's."
would you shut the fuck up! i know what you ordered, i was there!
so why don't you give me my sandwhich?
what do you mean "your sandwhich?" i bought it.
yah, all right...
how much money you got?
i told you, i just got change.
well give me your fuckin' change and we'll put your fuckin' sandwhich on lay-away.
why you gotta be an asshole chuckie?
i think you should establish a good line of credit.
she didn't do it again did she?
jesus christ. not even close.
did she get my double burger?
no she didn't get your double burger!! it's all fuckin' flyin' fish filet!!
jesus, that's really bad, did anyone even order a flyin' fish?
no, and we got four of 'em.
well, she out did herself today...
i don't got a crush on her.
what do we got?
i don't know yet.
come on, will...
shut up.
no, why didn't you fight him at the park if you wanted to? i'm not goin' now, i'm eatin' my snack. will  so don't go.
morgan, let's go.
i'm serious chuckie, i ain't goin'.
hey, thanks for comin' out.
yeah, you're all invited over to morgan's house for a complementary fish sandwhich.
when's the arraignment?
next week.
oh, i'm sorry.
what're you doing?
i'm sorry.
what's your name?  don't you walk away from me. this is people's work, you can't graffiti here.
hey fuck you.
well... i'll be speaking to your supervisor.
what happened?  you got fired, huh?
yeah, morgan. i got fired.
how fuckin' retarded do you have to be to get shit-canned from that job? how hard is it to push a fuckin' broom?
you got fired from pushing a broom, you little bitch.
yah, that was different. management was restructurin'--
--yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
fuck you, you fat fuck.
least i work for a livin'.  why'd you get fired?
my uncle can probably get you on my demo team.
what the fuck? i just asked you for a job yesterday!
i told you "no" yesterday!
okay.
so, you ladies ah, go to school here?
what class?
ah, history i think.
oh...
yah, it's not a bad school...
what class did you say that was?
history.
how'd you like that course?
good, it was all right.
history? just "history?" it must have been a survey course then.
hey, come on pal we're in classes all day. that's one thing about harvard never seizes to amaze me, everybody's talkin' about school all the time.
hey, i'm the last guy to want to talk about school at the bar. but as long as you're here i want to "seize" the opportunity to ask you a question.
to tell you the truth, i wasn't there much. the class was rather elementary.
elementary? oh, i don't doubt that it was. i remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
all right, are we gonna have a problem?
there's no problem. i was just hoping you could give me some insight into the evolution of the market economy in the early colonies. my contention is that prior to the revolutionary war the economic modalities especially of the southern colonies could most aptly be characterized as agrarian pre- capitalist and...
you suck.
what?
i've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. but i'm just tired now and i have to go home and i wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
i'm will.
skylar. and by the way. that guy over there is a real dick and i just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
i kind of got that impression.
well, look, i have to go. gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
i didn't mean you. listen, maybe...
here's my number.
great, or maybe we could go somewhere and just eat a bunch of caramels.
what?
when you think about it, it's just as arbitrary as drinking coffee.
okay, sounds good.
five minutes.
what?
i was trying to be smooth.  but at twelve-fifteen i was gonna come over there and talk to you.
see, it's my life story. five more minutes and i would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
the caramel thing is my pick-up line.
there goes that fuckin' barney right now, with his fuckin' "skiin' trip." we should'a kicked that dude's ass.
hold up.
excuse me. is this the buildings and grounds office?
yeah, can i help you?
i'm trying to find the name of a student who works here.
no students work for me.
could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
which one's your building?
building two.
well, if something was stolen, i should know about it.
no, no. nothing like that. i just need his name. terry i can't give you his name unless you have a complaint.
please, i'm a professor here and it's very important.
well, he didn't show up for work today...
yeah?
it's will, the really funny good looking guy you met at the bar?
i'm sorry, i don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
okay, you got me. it's the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser who got drunk and wouldn't leave you alone all night.
oh will! i was wondering when you'd call.
yeah, i figured maybe sometime this week we could go to a cafe and have some caramels.
sounds good, where are you now?
you aren't, by any chance, pre-law? are you?
hello. gerald lambeau, m.i.t.
fuck do you want?
i've spoken with the judge and he's agreed to release you under my supervision.
really?
yes. under two conditions.
what're those?
that you meet with me twice a week--
if i agree to this, i walk right now?
that's right.
i'll do the work. i'm not going to meet with a therapist.
now, it won't be as bad as it sounds, will.  i've already spoken to one therapist, his name is henry lipkin and he's a friend of mine. he's also published four books and is widely considered to be one of the brightest men in his field.  i'm sure it'll be better than spending the next six months in jail.
submit, bitch! submit! submit!
suck my cock!
oh, morgan!
what'd you get? you get leniency?
probation, counselin', few days a week.
you're fuckin' good.
that's why i love stock-car racin'. that dale ernhart's real good.
now you know will, and i know, what you need to be doing. you have a gift.
i could work the pit maybe, but i could never drive like dale ernhart--
--you have a quality-- something you were born with, that you have no control over- and you are, in a sense, hiding that by becoming a janitor. and i'm not saying that's wrong. i'm friends with the janitor that works in my building. he's been to my house for dinner. as a matter of fact i did some free consultation for "mike" -- that's not his real name. that's in my book.
yeah, i read your book. "mike" had the same problems as "chad" the stockbroker.
yes. the pressures you feel, and again, i am neither labeling nor judging them, are keeping you from fulfilling your potential -- you're in a rut. so stop the tom foolery -- the shenanigan's, will.
you're right. i know.
will, your not getting off that easy.
no, but, i mean you know...i do other things. that no one knows about.
like what, will?
i go places, i interact.
what places?
certain, clubs.  like, paradise. it's not bad.
i might understand that.
do you find it hard to hide the fact that you're gay?
what?
c'mon, i read your book. i talked to you. it's just something i know to be true.
that's very presumptuous.
buddy, two seconds ago you were ready to give me a jump.
well, i'm sorry to disappoint you, but i'm married and i have two children.
i'm sure you do. you probably got a real nice house, nice car -- your book's a best seller.
you're getting defensive, will.
look, man. i don't care if you're putting from the rough. there are solid arguments that some of the greatest people in history were gay; alexander the great, caeser, shakespeare, oscar wilde, napoleon, gertrude stein, not to mention danny terrio, not many straight men can dance like that.
who is "danny terrio?"
if you wanna hit "ramrod," take your shot. take some pride in it. you go to church? so fuckin' what, god loves you. i mean, christ. a guy as well known as you? by the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house sunday nights you probably look like "inspector cluseau."
well, i can see this is pointless...
you're getting defensive...henry. and hey, cheif--tell the wife, at least. christ, set her free.
this rectangle is subdivided into rectangles. one edge of an inner rectangle is an integer. can you prove that one edge of the larger rectangle is an integer?
of course.
okay. how?
it's an integer proof.
that would be a monumental waste of time, wouldn't it, will?
i think so.
i happen to know so.
what's that?
half-red, half-black--
--that?--
--half-red, half-black--
--that edge!
an integer.
shall we start the, uh...
yeah, when do i get my hypnosis? you guys been talkin' for twenty minutes.
okay, you're in your bed, will. now how old are you?
seven.
and what do you see?
somethin's in my room.
what is it?
it's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. gettin' closer.
you're in a safe place, will.
it's touching me.
where is it touching you?
down there.  and i'm nervous.
you don't have to be nervous, will.
oh, for god's sake, will.
oh, come on! you're not pinnin' this one on me. he left, i wanted to talk to him for another twenty minutes. i was havin' fun.
i told you to cooperate with these people.
c'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
get out, will.
okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
that's enough.
i called mel weintraub this morning, to check for availability.
what's the point?
what do you want to do?
there is somebody...
who is he?
he was my roommate in college.
sean.
well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. professor gerald lambeau is a field's medal winner. combunatorial mathematics. 1986.
hello.
the field's medal is the nobel prize for math.  but it's only given out every four years.
good to see you.
good to see you.
is there someplace we can talk?
i don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. private school, harvard, and now med. school.  i actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. i shouldn't have told you that...
i bet your parents were happy to pay.
i was happy to pay. i inherited the money.
is harvard gettin' all that money?
stanford. i'm leaving in june after i graduate.
so you just want to use me and go?
well, i'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
in that case, fine.  want to see my magic trick?
sure.
now, i'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
okay...
i didn't see you at the reunion.
i've been busy.
you were missed.  how long has it been since we've seen each other?
since nancy died.
i'm sorry, that damn conference--
i got your card.
have you ever seen annie hall?
no.
well, there's this part of the movie that's about how there's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what's going to happen with the whole 'good night kiss' thing.
i really don't 'date' that much.
you know what i mean. i know you've at least thought about it.
no i haven't...
yes you have. you were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
no i wasn't...
yes you were.
i was kinda' hopin' to get a "good night laid" but...i'll take a kiss.
oh, you will?
no...i was hoping to get a kiss.
then why don't we just get it out of the way.
free?
hey, i spent all my money on those caramels.
i've been busy, gerry. i got a full schedule.
this kid's special, sean. i've never seen anything like him.
not much free time, gerry. lambeau have you ever heard of a man named ramanujan?
yeah.
he was alive over a hundred years ago. he was indian. dots, not feathers...
and he mailed it to hardy--
--that's right, sean. he mailed it to a professor at cambridge who immediately recognized the brilliance in his work and brought ramanujan to england.
where he contracted pneumonia and died at a young age--
they worked together for the remainder of their lives, producing some of the most exciting math theory ever done. ramanujan's genius was unparalleled, sean. this boy is like that. but he's very defensive and i need someone who can get through to him.
why me?
i need someone with your kind of background.
my kind of background?
you're from the same neighborhood. south boston.
he's from southie? how many people did you try before you came to me?
five.
not rick? you didn't send him to rick?
just meet with the boy once a week.
can we do it at my office?
that would be fine.
i got it.
it's on the college.
any vulnerability he senses, he'll exploit.
i'll be okay.
it's a poker game with this young man. don't let him see what you've got.
no.
will, this is sean maguire. sean, will hunting.
would you excuse us?
tom.
you too, gerry.
did you buy all these books retail, or do you send away for like a "shrink kit" that comes with all these volumes included?
have you read all these books, will?
probably not.
how about the ones on that shelf?
yeah, i read those.
what did you think?
i'm not here for a fuckin' book report. they're your books, why don't you read 'em?
i did.
that must have taken you a long time.
yeah, it did take me a long time.
"a history of the united states, volume i." if you want to read a real history book, read howard zinn's "a people's history of the united states." that book will knock you on your ass.
how about noam chomsky's "manufacturing consent?"
you people baffle me. you spend all this money on beautiful, fancy books-- and they're the wrong fuckin' books.
you think so?
whatever blows your hair back.
guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. stunt your growth.
you're right. it really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
yes, i do.
nautilus?
free weights. will oh yeah? me too. what do you bench?
285.
oh.
yeah. do you paint?
no.
crayons?
this is a real piece of shit.
tell me what you really think.
poor color composition, lousy use of space. but that shit doesn't really concern me.
what does?
the color here, see how dark it is? it's interesting.
what is?
i think you're one step away from cutting your ear off.
oh, "starry night" time, huh?
you ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
sure, how 'bout "still waters run deep"--
--well, maybe that means you.
maybe what mea--
maybe you should be a patient and sit down.
maybe you married the wrong woman.
watch your mouth.
that's it isn't it? you married the wrong woman. she leave you? was she bangin' someone else?
if you ever disrespect my wife again...i will end you.
time's up.
you grew up around here?
not far from here, south boston.
how was that?
pretty boring, i guess.
i bet you have a great family.
you know, nothing special.
you have a lot of brothers and sisters?
do i have a lot of brothers and sisters?
yeah.
well, irish catholic. what do you think?
how many?
you wouldn't believe me if i told you.
what, five?
i have twelve big brothers.
not a chance.
yup, you're lookin' at lucky thirteen.
bullshit.
i swear to god.
your house must have been a zoo.
it was great. there was always someone to play with, give you advice.
do you know all their names?
'course i do, they're my brothers.
well...
marky, ricky, danny, terry, mikey, davey, timmy, tommy, joey, robby, johnny, and brian.
do you keep in touch with them?
all the time. we all live in southie. i live with three of them now.
i want to meet them.
we'll do that.
so what's with this place? you have a swan fetish? is this something you'd like to talk about?
i was thinking about what you said to me the other day, about my painting. i stayed up half the night thinking about it and then something occured to me and i fell into a deep peaceful sleep and haven't thought about you since. you know what occurred to me?
no.
you're just a boy. you don't have the faintest idea what you're talking about.
why thank you.
you've never been out of boston.
no.
so if i asked you about art you could give me the skinny on every art book ever written...michelangelo? you know a lot about him i bet. life's work, criticisms, political aspirations. but you couldn't tell me what it smells like in the sistine chapel. you've never stood there and looked up at that beautiful ceiling. and if i asked you about women i'm sure you could give me a syllabus of your personal favorites, and maybe you've been laid a few times too. but you couldn't tell me how it feels to wake up next to a woman and be truly happy. if i asked you about war you could refer me to a bevy of fictional and non-fictional material, but you've never been in one. you've never held your best friend's head in your lap and watched him draw his last breath, looking to you for help. and if i asked you about love i'd get a sonnet, but you've never looked at a woman and been truly vulnerable. known that someone could kill you with a look. that someone could rescue you from grief. that god had put an angel on earth just for you. and you wouldn't know how it felt to be her angel. to have the love be there for her forever. through anything, through cancer. you wouldn't know about sleeping sitting up in a hospital room for two months holding her hand and not leaving because the doctors could see in your eyes that the term "visiting hours" didn't apply to you. and you wouldn't know about real loss, because that only occurs when you lose something you love more than yourself, and you've never dared to love anything that much. i look at you and i don't see an intelligent confident man, i don't see a peer, and i don't see my equal. i see a boy. nobody could possibly understand you, right will? yet you presume to know so much about me because of a painting you saw. you must know everything about me. you're an orphan, right?
who'd you call?
no one. i didn't have the number.
keep fuckin' with me. watch what happens.
all right, then.
watch what happens.
what do you mean "he didn't talk?" you sat there for an hour?
no, he just sat there and counted the seconds until the session was over. it was pretty impressive, actually.
why would he do that?
to show me he doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
oh, what is this? some kind of staring contest between two kids from the "old neighborhood?"
i won't talk first.
i didn't get on cathy last night.
why not?
i don't know.
you know, i was on this plane once. and i'm sittin' there and the captain comes on and is like "we'll be cruising at 35,000 feet," and does his thing, then he puts the mike down but forgets to turn it off. then he says "man, all i want right now is a blow-job and a cup of coffee." so the stewardess goes runnin' up towards the cock-pit to tell him the mike's still on, and this guy in the back of the plane goes "don't forget the coffee!"
you've never been on a plane.
i know, but the joke's better if i tell it in the first person.
yeah? you got a lady now?
yeah, i went on a date last week.
how'd it go?
fine.
well, are you going out again?
i don't know.
why not?
haven't called her.
jesus christ, you are an amateur.
i know what i'm doing. she's different from the other girls i met. we have a really good time. she's smart, beautiful, fun...
so christ, call her up.
why? so i can realize she's not so smart. that she's boring. you don't get it. right now she's perfect, i don't want to ruin that.
and right now you're perfect too. maybe you don't want to ruin that.
i teach this shit, i didn't say i knew how to do it.
you ever think about gettin' remarried?
my wife's dead.
hence, the word remarried.
my wife's dead.
well i think that's a wonderful philosophy, sean. that way you can go through the rest of your life without having to really know anyone.
where have you been?
i'm sorry, i been real busy.
you were busy? you know, i really was waiting for you to call me.
sorry. i'm sorry. give me another crack at it. let me take you out.
you should have called. i have an "o- chem" lab due tomorrow and it's impossible.  it's not an excuse dummy. i want to go out with you. but look:
promise?
if you bring the caramels.
i couldn't wait till tomorrow.
how the hell did you do that?
didn't your mother ever tell you not to look a gift horse n the mouth?
i'm supposed to understand this.
you're not going into surgery tomorrow are you?
no.
then let's go have some fun.
really? how'd the date go? will do you still counsel veterans?  i read your book last night.
no, i don't.
why not?
i gave that up when my wife got sick.
is that why you didn't write anything else?
i didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
well, i've read you colleagues. your book was good, sean.  all those guys were in your platoon?
yeah.
what happened to that guy from kentucky?
lon? he got married. he has a kid. i kind of lost touch with him after nancy got sick.
do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you never met your wife?
what? do i wonder if i'd be better off if i never met my wife?
you don't regret meetin' your wife?
why? because of the pain i feel now? i have regrets will, but i don't regret a singel day i spent with her.
when did you know she was the one?
october 21, 1975. game six of the world series. biggest game in red sox history, me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. we were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. what a game that was. tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps carlton fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. thirty-five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. it hits the foul pole, home run. thirty-five thousand people went crazy. and i wasn't one of them.
where were you?
i was havin' a drink with my future wife.
you missed pudge fisk's homerun to have a drink with a woman you had never met?
that's right.
so wait a minute. the red sox haven't won a world series since nineteen eighteen, you slept out for tickets, games gonna start in twenty minutes, in walks a girl you never seen before, and you give your ticket away?
you should have seen this girl. she lit up the room.
i don't care if helen of troy walked into that bar! that's game six of the world series!
i just slid my ticket across the table and said "sorry fellas, i gotta go see about a girl."
"i gotta go see about a girl"? what did they say?
they could see that i meant it.
you're kiddin' me.
no will, i'm not kiddin' you. if i had gone to see that game i'd be in here talkin' abouta girl i saw at a bar twenty years ago. and how i always regretted not goin' over there and talkin' to her. i don't regret the eighteen years we were married. i don't regret givin' up couseling for six years when she got sick. i don't regret being by her side for the last two years when things got real bad. and i sure as hell don't regret missing that damn game.
would have been nice to catch that game though.
well hell, i didn't know pudge was gonna hit the home run.
alexander, i know your theory. the boy is updating, he's strategy stealing...
with a ramses graph on the binary tree--
--but what he's doing, he's attaching an edge to the adjacent vertex. he can always failsafe to either side--
maker can. this is not new, gerry!
no, there's a limit.
the limit is not found!  the limit is not found.
--maker builds "k" to the "n." n is three to the k times--
--but--
why do we always stay here?
'cause it's nicer than my place.
i've never seen your place.
exactly.
what about your friends? or your brothers? when do i get to meet them?
they don't come over here that much.
i think i can make it to south boston.
aah, it's kind of a hike.
is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
all right, all right. we'll go.
when?
sometime. i don't know. next week.
what if i said i wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
i'd say...  it's only four in the mornin', they're prob'ly up.
you men are shameful. if you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.
then on behalf of my weiner, i'd like to ask for an advance.
will, i can't believe you brought skylar here when we're all wrecked. what's she gonna think about us?
yeah, morgan. it's a real rarity that we'd be out drinkin'.
i've been shit faced for like two weeks.
oh great, tell her that! now she really thinks we're problem drinkers!
two weeks? that's nothin'. my uncle marty? will knows him. that guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! one night he was drivin' back to his house on i-93-- statie pulls him over.
oh shit.
guy's tryin' to walk the line--but he can't even fuckin' stand up, and so my uncle's gonna spend a night in jail. just then there's this fuckin' boom like fifty yards down the road. some guy's car hit a tree.
some other guy?
yeah, he was probably drunker than my uncle, who fuckin' knows? so the cop goes "stay here" and he goes runnin' down the highway to deal with the other crash. so, my uncle marty's standin' on the side of the road for a little while, and he's so fuckin' lit, that he forgets what he's waitin' for. so he goes, "fuck it." he gets in his car and drives home.
holy shit.
so in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the statie. so my uncle's like, "is there a problem?" and the statie's like "i pulled you over and you took off." and my uncle's like "i never seen you before in my life, i been home all night with my kids." and statie's like "let me get in your garage!" so he's like "all right, fine." he takes around the garage and opens the door --and the statie's cruiser is in my uncle's garage.
no way! you're kiddin'!
no, he was so hammered that he drove the police cruiser home. fuckin' lights and everything!
did your uncle get arrested?
the fuckin' trooper was so embarrassed he didn't do anything. the fuckin' guy had been drivin' around in my uncle's car all night lookin' for the house.
it's a good thing no one's irish here.
i'm irish.
i'm glad you came by, changed my opinion of harvard people.
see ya' chuckie. i had fun.
i don't know what the fuck you're doin'. you're givin' us a ride.
what do i look like, al cowlins?  you want to take my car, drop her off?
i was countin' on it.
chuck, let's go.
you're walkin' bitch, will's takin' the car.
thanks, chuck.
don't get too slap-happy, you're takin' me home first. will i don't know, chuck. it's kinda outta the way.
i thought you said you'd show me your place.
not tonight.
yeah, not tonight. not any other night. he knows, once you see that shit-hole he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.
i wanted to meet your brothers...
gerry! any trouble finding the place?
not at all.
timmy this is gerry, an old friend of mine. we went to college together.
good to meet you.
pleasure to meet you.
you're here quite a bit, then.
i live right around the corner.
you moved?
i been here a couple years.
seems like it's going well.
i think so.
well, have you talked to him at all about his future?
we haven't really gotten into it. lambeau maybe you should. my phone's been ringing off the hook with job offers.
jobs doing what?
cutting edge mathematics. think tanks. the kind of place where a mind like will's is given free reign.
that's great, gerry, that there's interest-- but i'm not sure he's ready for that.
sean, i really don't think you understand--
what don't i understand?
excuse me, timmy. could you help us? we're trying to settle a bet.
uh-oh.
have you heard of jonas salk?
yeah, cured polio.
you've heard of albert einstein?
how about gerald lambeau? ever heard of him?
no. lambeau okay thank you, timmy.
so who won the bet?
i did.
he married his cousin.
who?
einstein. had two marriages, both train-wrecks. the guy never saw his kids, one of whom, i think, ended up in an asylum--
you see, sean? that's exactly not the point. no one remembers that. they--
i do.
well, you're the only one.
just...take it easy, gerry.
look, i don't know what else i can say. i'm not sitting at home every night, twisting my mustache and hatching a plan to ruin the boy's life. but it's important to start early. i was doing advanced mathematics at eighteen and it still took me twenty-three years to do something worthy of a field's medal.
maybe he doesn't care about that.
sean, this is important. and it's above personal rivalry--
now wait a minute, gerry--
--no, no you hear me out, sean. this young man is a true prodigy--
--personal rivalry? i'm not getting back at you.
look, you took one road and i took another. that's fine.
is it gerry? 'cause i don't think it's fine with you. give him time to figure out what he wants.
that's a wonderful theory, sean. it worked wonders for you.
i'm not sure--
--these circumstances are mitigated. right now. they're mitigated.
will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.
retainer...
you want us to give you cash right now?
allegedly, what i am saying is your situation will be concurrently improved if i had two hundred sheets in my pocket right now.
i don't think i...larry?
i have about seventy-three...
will you take a check?
come now...what do you think i am, a juvinile? you don't got any money on you right now. you think i'm gonna take a check? executive it's fine, john, i can cover the rest.
how's it goin'?
fine.
want me to take a look?
no.
c'mon, give me a peek and we'll go to the battin' cages.
it's important that i learn this.
why is it important to you? if i inherited all that money, the only thing important to me would be workin' on my swing.
clearly.
you're rich. what do you have to worry about?
rich? i have an inheritance. it's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. that's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. this is what i'm doing with that money. i could have done anything i wanted. i could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
instead you're going to bust your ass for five years so you can be broke? skylar no, so i can be a doctor.
all right, mr. nosey parker. let me ask you a question? do you have a photographic memory?
i guess. i don't know. how do you remember your phone number?
have you ever studied organic chemistry?
some, a little.
just for fun?
i guess so.
nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." it's unnecessary. especially for someone like you.
like me?
yeah. someone like you who divides his time, fairly evenly, between the batting cages and bars.
do you play the piano?
come one will. i just want to know.
i'm trying to explain it to you. so you play the piano. when you look at the keys, you see music, you see mozart.
i see "hot cross buns," but okay.
well all right, beethoven. he looked at a piano and saw music. the fuckin' guy was deaf when he composed the ode to joy. they had to turn him around to take a bow because he couldn't hear the crowd going crazy behind him. stone deaf. he saw all of that music in his head.
so, do you play the piano?
not a lick. i look at a piano and i see black and white keys, three pedals and a box of wood. beethoven, mozart, they looked at it and it just made sense to them. they saw a piano and they could play. i couldn't paint you a picture, i probably can't hit the ball out of fenway park and i can't play the piano--
--but you can do my o-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
--when it came to stuff like that i could always just play.
hi.
how you doin'?
good.
how'd you know where to find me?
you were the only sullivan in the phone book.
oh, right.
this is your house, right?
i guess so.
what? no. this is my mother's house. i don't live with my mother. i just stop by, help out. i'm good like that.
is this a bad time?
she'll live.  if she starts yelling again i might have to run in real quick and beat her with the stick again but...
okay.
let's take a walk. ext. chuckie's street -- day
see, now this doesn't feel right.  when i made the decision to come over here it felt right. i had all these rationalizations... i just don't understand why will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--
you caught that, huh?
i just wanted to find out what was going on...but now that i'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
well, i don't have no trousers on...
i don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
i really don't know what to say. look, i lie to women all the time. that's just my way.  last week morgan brought these girls down from roslindale. i told them i was a cosmonaut. they believed me. but will's not usually like that--
is that true?
yeah, it is.
this is correct. i see you used mclullen here--
i don't know what it's called.
--this can't be right.  this is going to be very embarrassing. have you ever considered--
i'm pretty sure it's right.
can i ask you a favor, can we do this at sean's from now on? 'cause i leave work to come here and the fuckin' commute is killin' me--
that's fine, but did you ever think--
it's right.  take it home with you.
will, what happened at the tri-tech meeting?
i couldn't go 'cause i had a date. so i sent my cheif negotiator.
will, on your own time, you can do what you like. when i set up a meeting, with my associates, and you don't show up it reflects poorly on me.
then don't set up any more meetings.
i'll cancel every meeting right now. i'll give you a job myself. i just wanted you to see what was out there.
--maybe i don't want to spend my life sittin' around and explaining shit to people.
the least you can do is show me a little appreciation.
--you know how fuckin' easy this is to me? this is a joke!  and i'm sorry you can't do this. i really am. 'cause if you could i wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
well, i'm sorry.
so am i.  yes. that's right, will. most days i wish i never met you. because then i could sleep at night. i wouldn't have to walk around with the knowledge that someone like you was out there. and i wouldn't have to watch you throw it all away.
will? are you awake?
no.
come with me to california.
what?
i want you to come with me.
how do you know that?
i know. i just do.
yeah, but how do you know?
i don't know. i just feel it.
and you're sure about that?
yeah, i'm sure.
'cause that's a serious thing you're sayin'. i mean, we might be in california next week and you could find out somethin' about me that you don't like. and you might feel like "hey this is a big mistake."  but you can't take it back, 'cause you know it's real serious and you can't take somethin' like that back. now i'm in california, 'cause you asked me to come. but you don't really want me there. and i'm stuck in california with someone who really doesn't want me there and just wishes they had a take-back.
"take-back?" what is that? i don't want a take-back. i want you to come to california with me.
i can't go out to california.
why not?
one, because i have a job here and two because i live here--
look, will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
i'm not sayin' i'm not in love with you.
then what are you afraid of?
what do you mean "what am i afraid of?"
why won't you come with me? what are you so scared of?
what am i scared of?
well, what aren't you scared of? you live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
--don't tell me about my world. you're the one that's afraid. you just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry--
is that what you think--
--some prick from stanford that your parents will approve of. then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.
i inherited that money when i was thirteen, when my father died.
at least you have a mother.
fuck you! you think i want this? that money's a burden to me. every day i wake up and i wish i could give that back. i'd give everything i have back to spend one more day with my father. but that's life. and i deal with it. so don't put that shit on me. you're the one that's afraid.
what the fuck am i afraid of?!
you're afraid of me. you're afraid that i won't love you back. and guess what? i'm afraid too. but at least i have the balls to it give it a shot. at least i'm honest with you.
i'm not honest?
what about your twelve brothers?
oh, is that what this is about? you want to hear that i don't really have any brothers? that i'm a fuckin' orphan? is that what you want to hear?
yes, will. i didn't even know that?
no, you don't want to hear that.
yes, i do, will.
you don't want to hear that i got cigarettes put out on me when i was a little kid. that this isn't surgery
yes i do. did you ever think that maybe i could help you? that maybe that's the point, that we're a team?
what, you want to come in here and save me? is that what you want to do? do i have a sign that says "save me" on my back?
i don't want to "save" you. i just want to be with you. i love you. i love you!
don't bullshit me! don't fuckin' bullshit me!
you know what i want to hear? i want to hear that you don't love me. if you tell me that, then i'll leave you alone. i won't ask any questions and i won't be in your life.
so why do you think i should work for the national security agency?
well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. you'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. super string theory, chaos math, advanced algorithms--
codebreaking.
that's one aspect of what we do.
come on, that's what you do. you handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. you're seven times the size of the c.i.a.
that's exactly right, will. so the question as i see it isn't "why should you work for n.s.a." it's "why shouldn't you?"
why shouldn't i work for the national security agency? that's a tough one.
what's up guys?
why don't you beat off at your house?
i don't have a vcr at my house.
i just wanted to call before you left.  i'm takin' all these job interviews. so i won't just be a construction worker.
i never cared about that.
yeah.
i love you, will.  no take-backs.
take care.
goodbye.
what are you smiling at?
it's a carlton fisk baseball card.
so you might be working for uncle sam.
i don't know.
gerry says the meeting went well.
i guess.
what did you think?
what did i think?
do you think you're alone?
what?
do you have a soul-mate?
define that.
someone who challenges you in every way. who takes you places, opens things up for you. a soul-mate.
yeah.
they're all dead.
not to me, they're not.
but you can't give back to them, will.
not without a heater and some serious smelling salts, no...
that's what i'm saying, will. you'll never have that kind of relationship in a world where you're afraid to take the first step because all you're seeing are the negative things that might happen ten miles down the road.
oh, what? you're going to take the professor's side on this?
don't give me you line of shit.
i didn't want the job.
it's not about that job. i'm not saying you should work for the government. but, you could do anything you want. and there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. what do you want to do?
i didn't ask for this.
nobody gets what they ask for, will. that's a cop-out.
why is it a cop-out? i don't see anythin' wrong with layin' brick, that's somebody's home i'm buildin'. or fixin' somebody's car, somebody's gonna get to work the next day 'cause of me. there's honor in that.
you're right, will. any man who takes a forty minute train ride so those college kids can come in in the morning and their floors will be clean and their trash cans will be empty is an honorable man.
what?
if you won't answer my questions, you're wasting my time.
what?
i been there. i played my hand.
that's right. and you fuckin' lost! and some people would have the sack to lose a big hand like that and still come back and ante up again!
look at me. what do you want to do?
what should i do?
the boy was here. he came in, sat down and we worked together.
how's the woman?
gone.
what?
she went to medical school in california.
sorry, brother.  i don't know what to tell ya. you know all the girls i been with. you been with 'em too, except for cheryl mcgovern which was a big mistake on your part brother...
oh i'm sure, that's why only one of us has herpes.
some shows are worth the price of admission, partner.
suck my crank. fuckin' sheet metal pussy.  so, when are you done with those meetin's?
week after i'm twenty-one.
are they hookin' you up with a job?
yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
yah, but it's better than this shit. at least you'd make some nice bank.
yeah, be a fuckin' lab rat.
it's a way outta here.
what do i want a way outta here for? i want to live here the rest of my life. i want to be your next door neighbor. i want to take out kids to little league together up foley field.
look, you're my best friend, so don't take this the wrong way, but in 20 years, if you're livin' next door to me, comin' over watchin' the fuckin' patriots' games and still workin' construction, i'll fuckin' kill you. and that's not a threat, that's a fact. i'll fuckin' kill you.
chuckie, what are you talkin'...
listen, you got somethin' that none of us have.
why is it always this? i owe it to myself? what if i don't want to?
fuck you. you owe it to me. tomorrow i'm gonna wake up and i'll be fifty and i'll still be doin' this. and that's all right 'cause i'm gonna make a run at it. but you, you're sittin' on a winning lottery ticket and you're too much of a pussy to cash it in. and that's bullshit 'cause i'd do anything to have what you got! and so would any of these guys. it'd be a fuckin' insult to us if you're still here in twenty years.
you don't know that.
let me tell you what i do know. every day i come by to pick you up, and we go out drinkin' or whatever and we have a few laughs. but you know what the best part of my day is? the ten seconds before i knock on the door 'cause i let myself think i might get there, and you'd be gone. i'd knock on the door and you wouldn't be there. you just left.
this is a disaster! i brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out--
now wait a minute--
--and confuse him--
--gerry--
--and here i am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
hold on!
--ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.
i know what i'm doing and i know why i'm here!
look sean, i don't care if you have a rapport with the boy-- i don't care if you have a few laughs-- even at my expense! but don't you dare undermine what i'm trying to do here.
"undermine?"
he has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. and you don't understand that he's at a fragile point--
he is at a fragile point. he's got problems--
what problems does he have, sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with--
why do you think he does that, gerry?
he can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.
why is he hiding? why is he a janitor? why doesn't he trust anybody? because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!
oh, come on, sean--
--and why does he hang out with his friends? because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. it's called loyalty!
oh, that's nice--
--and who do you think he's handling? he pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. and for 20 years he's been alone because of that. and if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. and i'm not going to let that happen to him!
now don't do that. don't you do that! don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. that it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! if you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been--
--i'm not angry at you--
--yes you are, sean. you resent me. and i'm not going to apologize for any success that i've had.
--i don't have any anger at you--
yes you do. you're angry at me for doing what you could have done. ask yourself if you want will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.
that's it. that's why i don't come to the goddamn reunions! becaue i can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! you think i'm a failure! i know who i am. i'm proud of who i am. and all of you, you think i'm some kind of pity case! you with your sycophant students following you around. and you goddamn medal!
--is that what this is about, sean? the field's medal? do you want me to go home and get it for you? then will you let the boy--
--i don't want your trophy and i don't give a shit about it! 'cause i knew you when!! you and jack and tom sanders. i knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
that's right! you were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! so don't blame me for how your life turned out. it's not my fault.
i don't blame you! it's not about that! it's about the boy! 'cause he's a good kid! and i won't see this happen to him-- i won't see you make him feel like a failure too!
he won't be a failure!
if you push him into something, if you ride him--
you're wrong, sean. i'm where i am today because i was pushed. and because i learned to push myself!
he's not you!
i can come back.
no, that's fine, will. i was just leaving.
well, i'm here.  so, is that my problem? i'm afraid of being abandoned? that was easy.
look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way.  and it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.
do you want to talk about it?
oh, this is your file. i have to send it back to the judge with my evaluation.
you're not going to fail me are you?
you want to read it?
no.  have you had any experience with that?
twenty years of counselling you see a lot of--
--no, have you had any experience with that?
yes.
it sure ain't good.
gotta go with the belt there...
i used to go with the wrench.
the wrench, why?
cause fuck him, that's why.
oh, i know.
it's not your fault.
i know.
it's not your fault.
i know.
it's not your fault.
i know.
it's not your fault.
don't fuck with me.
it's not your fault.
i know.
it's not...
i know, i know...
oh my god, i got the most fucked up thing i been meanin' to tell you.
save it for your mother, funny guy. we heard it before.
oh, morgan.
you and morgan throw?
no, i had to talk him down.
why didn't you yoke him?
little morgan's got a lot a scrap, dude. i'd rather fight a big kid, they never fight, everyone's scared of 'em. you know how many people try to whip morgan's ass every week? fuckin' kid won't back down.
what'd you say about me?
shut the fuck up.
hey, asshole. happy birthday.
you thought we forgot, didn't you? i know i'm gettin' my licks in.
you're kiddin' me.
yeah, i figured now that you got your big job over in cambridge, you needed some way to get over there and i knew i wasn't gonna drive you every day...
me and bill scraped together the parts, worked on it. morgan was out panhandlin' every day.
fuck you, i did the body work. whose fuckin' router you think sanded out all that bondo?
guy's been up my ass for two years about a fuckin' job. i had to let him help with the car.
so, you finally got a job morgan?
had one, now i'm fucked again.
so what do you got, a fuckin' hyundai engine under there? can i make it back to my house?
which one did you take, will?
over at tri-tech. one of the jobs professor lambeau set me up with. i haven't told him yet, but i talked to my new boss over there and he seemed like a nice guy.
that's what you want?
yeah, i think so.
good for you. congratulations.
thanks you.  so, that's it? we're done?
we're done. you did your time. you're a free man.
i just want you to know, sean...
you're welcome, will.
i'll keep in touch.
i'm gonna travel a little bit, so i don't know where i'll be.
no. thank you.
does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
only if you grab my ass.
see ya.
good luck.
will.
hey, how you doin'?
you know, you're no longer required to come here.
i was just sayin' goodbye to sean.
sam called me. from tri-tech. he says you start working for them next week.
thank you.
i just want you to know...it's been a pleasure.
bullshit.
this job... do it if it's what you really want.
i appreciate that.
yes.
listen, i'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
thank you, will. i'll do that.
hello, sean.
come in.
sean...
me too.
so i hear you're taking some time.
yeah. summer vacation. thought i'd travel some. maybe write a little bit.
where're you going?
i don't know. india maybe.
why there?
never been.
do you know when you'll be back?
i got this mailer the other day. class of sixty-five is having this event in six months.
i got one of those too.
you should come. i'll buy you a drink.
how about one now?
sounds good.
sean, do you have any idea what the odds are against winning the lottery?
i don't know... gotta be at least four to one.
about thirty million to one.
you're pretty quick with those numbers. how about the odds of me buying the first round?
about thirty million to one.
