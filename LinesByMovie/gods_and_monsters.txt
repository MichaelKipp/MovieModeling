she tells me you have not been sleeping well.
it is the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  if i take them, i spend the next day stupid as a stone. if i don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once --
then take the pills.
i wanted to be alert for your visit today.  especially since i saw so little of you in the hospital.
I am sorry, jimmy.  but with this movie and two difficult stars --
"the fault, dear david, is not in ourselves but in our stars."
you remember how a production eats up one's life.
oh, david.  there is no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  you better go, my boy.  you will be late for that aeroplane.
by the way, i like the renoir.
thank you.
goodbye, hanna.
hanna?  who is the new yardman?
bone?  boom?  something bee.  i hire him while you were in the hospital.  he came cheap.
good morning.
mornin'.
my name is whale.  this is my house.
nice place.
and your name is --?
boone.  clayton boone.
i could not help but notice your tattoo.  that phrase?  death before dishonor.  what does it mean?
just that i was in the marines.
the marines.  good for you.  you must have served in korea.
getting to be a warm day.  a scorcher, as you yanks call it.
yeah.  i better get on with my work.
there is iced tea, hanna?  cucumber sandwiches?
yes, mr. jimmy.  an interview.  after so many years. very exciting.
do not be daft.  it is just a student from the university.
mr. kay, sir.
yes?
mr. whale, this is such an honor. you are one of my favorite all-time directors.  i can not believe I am meeting you.
no.  i expect you can't.
and this is your house.  wow.  the house of frankenstein.  i thought you would live in a spooky old mansion or villa.
one likes to live simply.
i know.  people's movies are not their lives.
that is my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "bride of frankenstein."
is it now?  hanna?  i think we will take our tea down by the swimming pool.
will that be good for you, mr. kay?
sure.
after you then.
this is the studio where i paint.
nice.  and your lighting and camera angles.  you are got to go back to german silent movies to find anything like it.
so, mr. kay?  what do you want to know?
everything.  start at the beginning.
i was born outside london, the only son of a minister who was a master at harrow.  grandfather was a bishop.  church of...church of eng...
yes?
your father was a schoolmaster?
of course.  i attended eton -- it would not do for a master's son to attend where his father taught.  i was to go up to oxford but the war broke out and i never made it.  the great war, you know.  you had a good war, but we had a great one.
there was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "journey's end".  every experienced director turned it down, so i offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  "journey's end" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  it was only a matter of time until hollywood beckoned.
how much longer before we get to "frankenstein"?
am i correct in assuming, mr. kay, that it is not me you are interested in, only my horror pictures?
oh no, i want to hear everything. you made twenty pictures in all --
twenty-one.  the romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  the horror pictures were trifles.  grand guignol for the masses.
but it is the horror movies you will be remembered for.
i am not dead yet, mr. kay.
no.  i never said you were.  or will be soon.
i have a proposal, mr. kay.  this mode of questioning is getting old, do not you think?
i do not mind.
let's make it more interesting.  i will answer any question you ask. but, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing.
that is funny, mr. whale.
it is, is not it?  my life as a game of strip poker.  shall we play?
you are serious.
quite.
then the rumors are true?
what rumors might those be?
that you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.
a homosexual scandal, you mean? for me to answer a question of that magnitude, you will have to remove both your shoes and your socks.
too warm for a sweater, anyway.
you must understand how hollywood was twenty years ago.  nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  outside of hollywood, who knows who george cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along santa monica?
george cukor?  who made "a star is born"?  i never guessed.
take off your vest and I will tell you a story.
do not be shy.  there is time to stop before you go too far.
i guess.
can we talk about the horror movies now?
certainly, mr. kay.  is there anything in particular you want to know?
will you tell me everything you remember about making "frankenstein"?
can that count as one question?
of course.
i can not believe I am doing this.
just like going swimming, is not it?
maybe you would like a swim when we are through.  i never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
okay.  "frankenstein."  tell me everything.
righto.  let me see.
universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- i mean badly, not baldly.  i was given the pick of stories being developed, and i picked that one.
who came up with the monster's makeup and look?
my idea.  muchly.  my sketches. big heavy brow.  head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef.
he is one of the great images of the twentieth century.  as important as the mona lisa.
you think so?  that is very kind --
mr. whale?  are you all right?
i just need to -- lie down. studio.  daybed in studio.
oh my god.  what is wrong, mr. whale?  is it your heart?
head.  not heart.
which ones?  i bring them all.
luminal.
i was going to take a swim.
I am sorry i spoiled it for you. you should probably go home.
right.
you must think I am terrible, hanna.
i do not think you anything anymore.  just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
oh shut up.  all we did was talk. my attack had nothing to do with him.
perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
no.  let me lie here.  thank you.
boone!  you awake?  eight o'clock.
fuck off!
you told me to get you up, asshole.
I am up.  thanks.
hasta la vista, boone.  and give the jail bait a squeeze for me.
everything alright, mr. boone?
just got away from me.  sorry to disturb you.
i was just about to ask hanna to bring down iced tea.  I would like it very much if you would join me.
i stink to high heaven right now.
the honest sweat of one's brow.  i assure you i will not be offended. let me tell hanna to bring tea for two.
or would you prefer a beer?
no.  iced tea's fine.
splendid.
these are your paintings?
what?  oh yes.
excuse me, but -- are you famous?
you know what they say.  if you have to ask --
I am just a hick who cuts lawns. but some of these look familiar.
they were familiar when i painted them.  that one's copied from a dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  and that is a rembrandt.
they are just copies then.  gotcha.
but before i retired, you might say i had a brief time in the sun. fame, as it were.  tell me, do you like motion pictures?
sure, everybody does.  when i was a kid I would go with my sister twice a week.  why?  were you an actor or something?
in my youth, yes, but never in hollywood.  no, i was merely a director here.
yeah?  what were some of your movies?
this and that.  the only ones you maybe have heard of are the "frankenstein" pictures.
really?
"frankenstein" and "bride of" and "son of" and all the rest?
i made only the first two.  the others were done by hacks.
still.  you must be rich.  making a couple of famous movies like those.
merely comfortable.  here's hanna with our refreshments.  can you get the door?
how are you feeling, mr. jimmy? how is your mind today?
my mind's lovely.  and yours?
you remember what the doctor tells us.
yes, yes, yes.  i merely invited mr. boone in for a glass of tea. we will have a brief chat and he will finish the yard.
i am not forgetting your last brief chat.
just go.  we can manage without you.
he looks plenty big.  you will not need my help if anything goes flooey.
go.
when they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they are married to you.  please, mr. boone.  help yourself.
what did she mean by going flooey?
i returned recently from a stay in hospital.
what was wrong?
nothing serious.  a touch of stroke.
you must excuse me for staring, mr. boone.  but you have a marvelous head.
huh?
to an artistic eye, you understand. have you ever modeled?
you mean, like posed for pictures?
sat for an artist.  been sketched.
what is to sketch?
you have the most architectural skull.  and your nose.  very expressive.
broke is more like it.
but expressively broken.  how did it happen?
football in college.
you went to university?
just a year.  i dropped out to join the marines.
yes.  you were a marine.
i apologize for going on like this. it is the sunday painter in me.  of course i can understand your refusal.  it is a great deal to ask of someone.
you mean -- you really want to draw me?
indeed.  I would pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
but why?
even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
and it is just my head you want? nothing else?
what are you suggesting?  you will charge extra if i include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
you do not want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
i have no interest in your body, mr. boone.  i can assure you of that.
all right then.  sure.  i could use the extra dough.
excellent.  we will have a most interesting time.
you are a lucky man, mr. whale. whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
yes, yes, dr. payne.  but from the neck up?  what is my story there?
that is what I am trying to explain.
the central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations.  whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.
you are saying there is an electrical storm in my head?
that is as good a way as any to describe it.  I have seen far worse cases.  you might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
but the rest of it?  the killing headaches.  the phantom smells.  my inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. it is all nothing more than bad electricity?
in a manner of speaking.  I have never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I am sure they are related.
so what do i do?
take the luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
you seem to be saying that this is not just a case of resting until I am better.  that my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.
do not worry, you already paid me. I am here because --
the master is waiting for you.
it is your job, lady, not mine.  I am here so he can draw my picture.
I am keeping away.  what you are doing is no business of mine.
what are you talking about?
what kind of man are you?  are you a good man?
yeah, I am a good man.  something make you think I am not?
you will not hurt him?
gimme a break.  I am going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures.  is that going to hurt him?
no.  no.  i am sorry.  forget everything i say.  here.  i will take the tray.
you do that.
did you see this?  they are showing one of your movies tomorrow night.
you do not say?  which picture?
"bride of frankenstein."
hmmm.  i much prefer "show boat" or "the invisible man."  shall we begin?
that shirt, mr. boone.
it is new.
I am sorry.  it is too white, too distracting.  would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
I am not wearing an undershirt.
pish posh, mr. boone.  I am not your aunt tilly.
but it is just my face you want to draw.
oh if it is going to make you uncomfortable...  perhaps we can find something else for you to wear.
we could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
all right already.  I will take it off.  kind of warm in here anyway.
take a picture, it lasts longer.
that is exactly what i intend to do.
would you be more comfortable barefoot?  feel free to remove your boots and socks.
no.  I am fine.
it is a bit like being at the doctor, is not it?  you have to remain perfectly still while i examine and scrutinize you.
dripping?  do you ever eat dripping in this country?  the fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  used like butter on bread.
sounds like something you feed the dog.
it is.  only the poorest families ever ate it.  we kept ours in a crockery jar.
your family ate dripping?
of course not.  as i said, only poor people --
I am sorry.  I have just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
what?
I have spent most of my life outrunning my past.  now it is flooding all over me.
there is something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth.  yes, my family ate dripping.  beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley.  are you also from the slums, mr. boone?
we were not rich.  but we were not poor either.
no, you were middle class, like all americans.
i guess you would say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
in dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any american can imagine.  every englishman knows his place.  and if you forget, there is always someone to remind you.  my family had no doubts about who they were.  but i was an aberration in that household a freak of nature.  i had imagination, cleverness, joy.  where did i get that?  certainly not from them.
you have to excuse me, mr. boone. since my stroke, i am often overcome with nostalgia.
i do not mind.  I am not crazy about my old man either.
i liked it.  you learn stuff listening to old-timers.
you ever hear of this whale fellow?
can not say that i have.  can not say I have heard of a lot of people though.
if you do not believe me, let's watch this movie.  see if his name's on it.  how about it, harry? can i watch my damn movie?
i told you.  i do not turn on the tv except for the fights.
thanks, doll.
i say let loverboy watch his movie.  and be grateful boone's not cutting shirley temple's lawn.
why is everybody giving me crap tonight?
this kisser was not so bad you could not lay under it a few times.
ooooh.
what makes you say that?
just thinking out loud.
yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
all right, then.  he is interested in you for your conversation.  we know what a great talker you are.
fuck you.
not anymore you don't.  doll.
we are watching the movie, harry. you got that!  we are watching my fucking movie.
calm down, clay.  just calm down. we will watch it.
good.  fine.
this looks corny.
go wash glasses if you do not like it.
oh, that monster.  how could you be working with him?
do not be silly, hanna.  he is a very proper actor.  and the dullest fellow imaginable.
these old movies are such a hoot. they thought they were being scary, but they are just funny.
maybe it is supposed to be funny.
funny is funny and scary is scary. you do not mix them.
you are like a dog with a bone over this movie, clay.
i just want to watch it, okay?
he is not going to kill the old man?
no, hanna.  my heart is not that black.
sick stuff.  necrophilia.  i wonder if they knew how sick they were.
the monster's lonely and he wants a friend, a girlfriend, somebody. what sick about that?
she is horrible.
she is beautiful.
so what did you think?
weird.
you coming, boone?
i think I will hang around.
go home, clay.  we are closing up.
i thought I would give you a hand since i kept you open.
you know what?  i think you guys are all jealous.
what is to be jealous of?
I have gotten to know someone who is famous.
not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
if he were that famous, he probably would not give me the time of day. this way, he is like my famous person.  yeah, my own personal famous person.  who treats me like I am somebody worth talking to.
what is that mean?
it means it is too cold to go swimming.  and i do not mean the water.
i was not going to try anything.
yeah, and I am never going to smoke another cigarette.
this old guy -- he is the kind of person i expected to meet when i moved out here.  someone who is done things with his life.
do you realize you are more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
it is different.  he is a man.  and by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
it never crossed your mind?
he is an artist.  anyway, he is too old to think about sex.
all the old men i know think about nothing but sex.
you picked up that girl right in front of me.
hey, no strings, right?  that is what you always said.  just good pals who have the hots for each other.
it still hurt.  a lot.
i did not mean to...
no, I am actually kind of glad it happened.  it made me wonder what the hell i was doing with my life. letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
you liked it too.
sure.  i loved it.
if you enjoy it, you should do it.
you know, i just can not do that anymore.  i still have time to get things right.  get married again --
you mean us?
the look on your face!  you are not marriage material.  you are not even boyfriend material.  you are a kid. a big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
I am not a kid.
what are you then?  what will you be ten years from now?  still cutting lawns?  still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
i like my life.  I am a free man.
sure you are free, for now at least. but how long before you are just alone?  pathetic and alone.
so you do not want to fuck.  that is what you are telling me?
is that all this conversation means to you?  am i going to put out or not?
damn straight.  I am sick of playing games.
you will take them all, mr. jimmy?
I will be fine, hanna.  thank you.
good night.
uh-oh.  the way you look at me, james.  what have you done this time?
bring a mirror.  let the bride feast upon her visage.
boris?  do i look a fright?
and you said there would be some of me left.  nobody's going to know me in this getup.
nonsense, my dear.  you look extraordinary.  today's script.  quick.  and a pencil.
my god.  is the audience to presume that colin and i have done her hair?  i thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.
only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.
oh no, my dear.  you look absolutely amazing.  there is no way i can compete with you.  the scene is yours.
in the sequel, james, two lady scientists should make a monster. and our monster would be gary cooper.
i would have thought mr. leslie howard would be more your line.
more your line.
my line nowadays runs to rin tin tin.  dogs are so much more dependable than men.
does the yardman come today?
of course.  this afternoon.
something i can do for you?
the master wants to know if you are free for lunch.  i tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists i ask.
got a lawn this afternoon, but I am free until then.
expect nothing fancy.
the master is dressing.  i am to offer you a drink.  there is whiskey and there is iced tea.
tea is fine.
no.  you are a guest now.  you go in the living room.
that is okay, hanna.  I am more comfortable in here.  it is hanna, is not it?
how long you worked for mr. whale?
long enough.  fifteen years.
i bet you have seen a lot of famous people come and go?  movie stars?
no.  we live simply, mr. jimmy and i.  people come to play bridge. and now and then, young men to swim.  you have people, boone?
you mean family?  all in joplin, missouri.
your wife?
I am not married.
why?
oh, i do not know.  because no girl in her right mind will have me?
a man who is not married has nothing.  he is a man of trouble. you need a woman.
you proposing what i think you are proposing?  do not you think I am a little young for you?
you ever been married, hanna?
of course.  i am married still.
yeah?  what is your husband do?
he is dead now, twenty years.
then you are as single as i am.
no.  i have children, grandchildren too.  i visit when i can.  but now that mr. jimmy cannot be left very long, i do not get away much.  poor mr. jimmy.  there is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  very sad.
you are sure of that?
this is what the priests tell me. his sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
sins of the flesh?  everybody has those.
no.  his is the worse.  the unspeakable.  the deed no man can name without shame?
what is the good english?  all i know is bugger.  he is a bugger. men who bugger each other.
a homo?
yes!  you know?
that is why he must go to hell.  i do not think it fair.  but god's law is not for us to judge.
you are telling me mr. whale is a homo.
you did not know?
well...no, not really --
you and he are not doing things?
no!
good.  that is what i hope.  i did not think you a bugger too.  i fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
I am not going to hurt anyone.
yes.  i trust you.
how are you, mr. boone?  so glad you are free for lunch.
all right, i guess.
i assume you worked up an appetite with your labor.
do you mind?
go ahead.
is this david's doing?
this david's a friend?
yes.  an old, useless friend.  you must excuse me, mr. boone.  this is a world i finished with long ago. i pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment.  lunch should be ready.  shall we?
saw your movie the other night. watched it with some friends.
did you now?
i liked it.  we all did.
did anyone laugh?
no.
pity.  people are so earnest nowadays.
why?  was it supposed to be funny?
of course.  i had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  a comedy about death.  the trick is not to ruin it for anyone who is not in on the joke.  but the monster never receives any of my gibes.  he is noble.  noble and misunderstood.
did you kill anyone?
i do not like to talk about that.
it is nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. that is something to be proud of.
proud?  any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
quite true.  hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand?
no.  i could have, though.
yes, i believe you could.  how free is your schedule this afternoon?
full up.  i got the hedges to do here, then another lawn out by la cienega.
what is we say phooey to the hedges?  could you spare an hour after lunch?  to sit for me?
can not today.
I will pay our going rate.  plus what you would get if you did the hedges.
sorry.  i do not feel like sitting still today.
all righty.  i understand.
just a trim.  and mine while you are at it.  fingers are a bit stiff today.
you ever been married, mr. whale?
no.  at least not in the legal sense.
so you had a wife?
or a husband.  depending on which of us you asked.  my friend david. he lived here for many years.
does that surprise you?
no, i -- you are a homosexual.
oh dear.  if one must have a clinical name.
I am not, you know.
i never thought you were.
you do not think of me that way, do you?
what way might that be?
you know.  look at me like -- like i look at women.
do not be ridiculous.  i know a real man like you would break my neck if i so much as laid a hand on him. besides, you are not my type.
so we understand each other?
what you do is no business of mine. live and let live, i say.
i hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today?
no.  i --
can i see what you did so far?
it will only make you self-conscious.  you will have to remove your shirt.
sorry.  not today.
but we have to match the other sketch.
i just feel more comfortable keeping it on.  you just said you did not want me self-conscious.
oh dear.  i have made you nervous.
I am fine.  I would just rather keep it on.
suppose we unbutton the top and pull it down around your shoulders? two buttons.  is that so much to ask?  just two little buttons.
i do not mean to be a prick, but that is how i feel.
of course.  i do not want to scare you off.  not before I am finished with you.
tell me more about yourself, mr. boone.  you have a steady companion?
not at the moment.
why not?
you know how it is.  you have to kiss ass just to get a piece of it.
very well put.
the world is just one kiss-ass game after another.  a man has to make up his own life, alone.
ah.  a philosopher.
thoreau with a lawnmower.
i like that.  but take care, mr. boone.  freedom is a drug, much like any other.  too much can be a very bad thing.
is that why you and your friend split up?  because you wanted to be free?
in a way, yes.  i suppose so.  i know it is why i stopped making pictures.
you might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when i was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  the horror movies were behind me.  I would done "show boat." major success.  great box office. now i was to do something important.  "the road back."  an indictment of the great war and what it did to germany.  it was to be my masterpiece.
what happened?
the fucking studio butchered it. it was 1937, hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the new york bankers stood in line to curry his favor.  anything to avoid losing the german market.  they cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. the picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb.  for which i was blamed.
after that, i went out of fashion. i was no longer able to command the best projects, so i walked away.  why should i spend my time working in such a dreadful business?
do you miss it?
it is so far in the past now.  over fifteen years --
i think we all want to feel we have left our mark on the world.  yes. i wish i had done more work.
you have done a helluva lot more than most people.
better work.
but i chose freedom.  david was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  i did not fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend."  the dirty little secret of a nervous producer.
how long were you...?
twenty years.  too long.  we were like a play whose run outlasted the cast's ability to keep it fresh. so i finally decided to close down the show.
of course, they were not nearly as bashful.  no, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  and pricks.  hard, arrogant pricks --
cut it out!
is not it enough you told me you are a fairy?  do you have to rub my nose in it?
i assure you, mr. boone, i meant no --
from now on, mr. whale, i cut your grass and that is it.  understand?
the extras are in their places. now we need the star.  would not you like to get in the pool?
you first.
oh no.  i never swim.
where is betty?
she took the night off.  heavy date.  some guy she is had her eye on for a while.
hey, boone.
have a drink?
who was that at the door?
a visitor.
mr. boone.  you are not due to cut the lawn until wednesday.
I would like to sit for you again.  but only if you ease up on the locker room talk.  okay?
I am curious, mr. boone.  what convinced you to come back?
i do not know.  i guess i like your stories.
everybody has stories to tell.
not me.
what about your stint in korea? I am sure it was full of dramatic episodes.
i told you.  i do not like to talk about that.
and the fear you showed at our last session?  how did you overcome that?
not fear.  more like disgust.
same difference, mr. boone. disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  am i right in assuming that you have had little experience with men of my persuasion?
there is no people like you in my crowd.
no teammates in football?  no comrades in korea?
you must think the whole world is queer.  well it is not.  war sure isn't.
oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.
you are talking through your hat now.
not at all.  i was in the foxholes myself.
you were a soldier?
i was an officer.
this was world war i?
no, my dear.  the crimean war. what do you think?  the great war. you had a good war, while we had --
barnett.  was that his name? leonard barnett.  he came to the front straight from harrow.  and he looked up to me.  unlike the others, he did not care that i was a workingman impersonating his betters.  how strange, to be admired so blindly.  i suppose he loved me.  but chastely, like a schoolboy.
something happened to him?
you will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  not this lane. not today.
i did not --
why do i tell you this?  i never told david.  i never even remembered it until you got me going.
you are the one who started it.
you are very clever, mr. boone.  you just sit there and let me talk. what a sorry old man, you are thinking.  what a crazy old poof.  why are you here?  what do you want from me?
you asked me to model.  remember?
of course i remember.  do you think I am so senile --
just go.  please.  why do not you go?
i do not get it.  first you creep me out with homo shit.  then you hit me with war stories.  and now you are upset because i listen? what do you want?
i want -- i want...
my apologies.  i had no business snapping at you.
no harm done.
it was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  you cannot force what will not flow.
you do not want me to sit for you anymore?
if you do not mind driving, I would like to take you as my guest.  there should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.
I am game.  sure.
very good, clayton.  may i call you clayton?  or do you prefer boone?
clayton is fine.
mr. boone.  he is an interesting friend.
I would hardly call our yardman a friend.
no.  but someone you can talk to.
do you miss having someone to talk to, hanna?
i have my family.  also our lord jesus christ.
of course.  how is the old boy these days?
it needs a hat.  there was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
it must be up in your old room.  i will look.
that is my daughter.  she say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon.  i am sorry, mr. jimmy.  i will make it short.
I will be out this afternoon, remember?  your family can visit as long as they like.
no.  i do not cook for them.  my daughter's no-good husband will not take one bite of our food.
good afternoon, clayton.
do i look okay?
i suppose you would like the top down.
if that is okay?
nothing would please me more.
what did i tell you?  listen.
i do not hear anything.
exactly.  cukor was too cheap to hire music.  there is nothing but chin-wag.  the cold dreary custard of english chin-wag.
how are you?
fine.  quite fine.  and your royal highness?
splendid.  now that i know you are around.
can we get together while I am in town?  i so badly want to sit for you again.
sit?
I have changed my hair, you see. since our last session.  those old snaps look rather dowdy now.
oh dear.  have i made a blunder?
ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  james whale.
i am such a goose.  i mistook you for cecil beaton.  it is the hat. you are wearing one of cecil's hats, you know.
what was that about?
nothing of importance.  just two old men slapping each other with lilies.  shall we have a drink?
who is that?
david.  the friend i thought was in new york.
no.  the girl.
girl?  oh.  elizabeth taylor.
is that really her?
david produced her last picture.
what are you doing here?
just what i was about to ask you. i thought you were in new york.
i was, until last night.  publicity asked me to fly miss taylor in for today's reception.
should you be drinking in your condition?
oh, david, stop being a nanny.
you should have seen georgie's face when he met clayton.
you didn't, jimmy.
i did.  but princess margaret was a doll.  we are all equals in her eyes.  as commoners, i presume.
you only embarrass yourself.
oh dear.  I will never work in this town again?
you know what i mean.  your reputation.
but i have no reputation.  I am as free as the air.
well the rest of us aren't.  can not you remember that?
no.  i never could.  you must regret having had the invitation sent.
i did not ask george to invite you.
then who did?
jimmy, there are people here i need to speak to.  you will be fine on your own?
yes.  perfectly.
all right, then.  I will come by tomorrow for breakfast.
mr....kay?
bet you thought you would never see me again.  i did not know if you would be well enough to come to this party.
you didn't?
I am the one who got you on mr. cukor's guest list.
you, mr. kay?  how do you know george cukor?
i interviewed him after i met you. I am his social secretary now. well, assistant to his secretary.
i commend you.  if you are going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  you waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
do not think that, mr. whale.  i love your movies.  that is why i wanted you to come to this.  so i could see you with your monsters.
my monsters?
do not go away.
jimmy.  how are you?
elsa?
i saw una o'conner a few weeks ago. she said you would been under the weather.
oh, nothing out of the ordinary. growing old.
we are all getting a bit long in the tooth.
but you appear quite fresh, my dear.
please.  you should not stand on my account.
perfectly all right.  but if you would like to sit --
I am fine, jimmy.  i can only stay a few minutes.
of course.
what is our pesky friend up to now?
is that boris?  our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
oh dear.
we will be in touch, jimmy.
good-bye.  so nice to see you...
are you enjoying yourself?
actually, no.  i feel a little out of place.
neither of us really belongs here.
must have been funny for you. seeing your monsters again.
monsters?  the only monsters...  ...are here.
oh fuck.  and we left the top down. you want to run for it?
run for what?
can not you see?  it is raining!
let's get out of this funk hole
you do not want to wait it out? rain should let up soon.
we are not sugar.  we will not melt.
i better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia.
catch my death.
it is not like her.
just a night out.  sounds like she can not say no to her daughter.
certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
good.  let's get dry.
oh, of course.  clayton.  you finished your shower already?
ten minutes ago.  did not you hear me calling?
I am afraid not.  terribly sorry.  i believe i promised you some clothes.
you are much wider than i am.  you will not want to attempt to get into my pants.
no.  definitely not.
that only leaves the rest.
you do not have any baggy shorts? pajama bottoms?
sorry.  my pajamas are tailored. would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  no more immodest than a kilt, you know.
do i have any other choice?
very sporting of you, clayton.
is that --?
the only memento i ever kept.  my original sketch for the monster.
after dinner, if hanna is not back? can we try a few more sketches?
i thought you would given up on my picture.
I would like to try again.  if you are game.
why not?  give us something to do while we wait.
tell me something, clayton.  do you believe in mercy killing?
never gave it much thought.
come now.  I am sure you came across such situations in korea.  a wounded comrade, or perhaps one of the enemy?  someone for whom death would be a blessing.
i never made it to korea.
but you said --
-- that i was a marine.  which is true.  you filled in the rest.
i see.
my old man was a marine.  he enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
the great war?
by the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  he missed out.
a very lucky thing indeed.
that is not the way he saw it.  to him, it was like his life never got started.  nothing else really mattered.  definitely not his family.
the morning after pearl harbor, he drove down to st. louis to reenlist.  he was so damn excited. world war ii was going to be his second chance.  they told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted.  said he would be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
is that why you joined the marines? for your father's sake?
i figured he would think, you know -- it was the next best thing.  hey, i loved it too.  a chance to be a part of something important. something bigger than yourself.
what happened?
i did not have the guts for it.
you know what he did when i called him?  he laughed.  he laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel.  said it was a good lesson for me.  not to try to fill his shoes.
I am very sorry.
them's the breaks, right?  no war stories for this pup.
that is where you are wrong, clayton. you have just told one.  a very good story indeed.
do you mind?
not at all.
storm's getting worse.
"a perfect night for mystery and horror.  the air itself is filled with monsters."
that is from your movie, right? "the only monsters are here."
i do not remember that one.
james whale.  this afternoon at the party.
i said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "the only monsters are here."  i was wondering which here you meant.
i do not recall.  memories of the war, perhaps.
but that was so long ago.  it can not still bother you.
oh, but it does.  especially in light of the journey I am about to make.
you are planning a trip?
barnett.  barnett on the wire.
your friend?
oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? grave where thy victory?
you survived it.  it can not hurt you now.  it is no good to dig it up.
oh no, my friend.  it is digging itself up.  there is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it.  all my diversions have abandoned me.  parties.  reading. painting.  work.  love.  all gone to me now.
so it is going to happen after all.
what did you say?
no.  it will not do.
what will not do?
you are much too human.
what did you expect?  bronze?
do not move.
why?
for the artistic effect.  the combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  it is quite striking.
i do not know.
please, clayton.  just for a minute.  long enough for me to see the effect.
it is from the first world war, is not it?
there are straps in back.
all right.  let's take it off now.
what was that?
it is too tight.
just take off the fucking mask!
relax, clayton.  i can not hear you. i can not hear a word.
I am not that way.  get it through your fucking head.  i do not want to mess with you.
oh, but you feel good, clayton.
wait until i tell my friends i had you naked in my arms.  will not they be surprised?
i have not done a damn thing with you!
oh, but you have.  you undressed for me.  i kissed you.  i even touched your prick.  how will you be able to live with yourself?
break my neck.  or strangle me.  it would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  please, clayton. we have come this far.
you are crazy.
look, if you want to die do it yourself!
no, i do not want to die alone.  but to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  they say you never see the one with your name on it.  but i want to see death coming at me.  i want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  your face.  think, clayton.  you would be my second monster.  almost as famous as the first.  it would be the great adventure you have yearned for. a war story for both of us to share.
you okay?
oh clayton.
did i hurt you?
nothing i did not deserve.
need some help?
pray you, undo this button.
i can undress myself, thank you.
all right.
when you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --
you will feel better tomorrow.
tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
it is not what you think.
i have brought you your clothes. all i ask is that you get dressed and go.  we are having a guest for breakfast.
i need to talk to you about mr. whale.
there is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
maybe.  but i still need to talk. do i have time for a cup of coffee before i go?
i blame my daughter for keeping me out so late.  i only hope you did not get him excited.  it could give him a new stroke.
thanks.  why do you do it?
what do i do?
take care of mr. whale like he was your flesh and blood.
it is my job.  i did it when he was happy and it was easy.  it is only fair i do it now when he is ill.  enough talk.  i must wake up the master.
what have you done with him?
i put him to bed.  he is not there?
i did not do it.  this was not me.
oh, mr. jimmy.
he wanted me to kill him, but i didn't.  he did it himself.
he says here good-bye.  i find it in his room.  he is sorry, he says. he has had a wonderful life.
you must leave.  you were not here this morning.
but i did not do this!
the police will not know that. they will want to investigate.
we have his note.
do you want to be questioned about you and mr. jimmy?  please, clayton.  it will be better if i find the body alone.
but how're you going to explain this?  how did you get him out of the pool?
you are right.  yes.  we must put him back.
