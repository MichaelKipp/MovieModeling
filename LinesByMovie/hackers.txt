anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. i'm in this computer right? so i'm looking around...
d'you bring those crayola books?
what's that?
devil book. the unix bible.
what's that?
dragon book. compiler design.
oh yeah? what's that?
the red book. nsa trusted networks. otherwise known as the ugly red book that won't fit on a shelf.
what are you, stoned or stupid? you don't hack a bank across state lines from your house, you'll get nailed by the fbi. where are your brains, in your ass? don't you know anything?
stupid, man. it's universally stupid.
you guys always think i should know everything, and you never tell me anything. am i right?
alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
love, secret, and uh, sex.  but not in that order, necessarily, right?
yeah but don't forget god. system operators love to use god. it's that whole male ego thing.
look, you wanna be elite? you gotta do a righteous hack. none of this accidental shit.
oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those gibsons man. you know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
ain't no way, man, security's too tight. the big iron?
maybe. but, if i were gonna hack some heavy metal, i'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
yeah but oh man,  wouldn't you just love to get one of those gibsons, baby? ooooh!
cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
it was him, man!
you're psyched. you need to lay off of that shit.
i'm gonna hit you!
mr. belford?
my name is the plague.
uh, mr. the plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
as in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
uh, the accounting subdirectory in the gibson is working really hard. we got one person online, the workload is enough for like ten users. i think we've got a hacker.
never fear. i is here.
i've narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
let's echo 23, see what's up.
you heard of a hacker called acid burn? you know who he is?
no, don't know who he is.  do you?
crash override.
never heard of you. done anything?
no.
uh... nikon, can i... can i crash at your place tonight?
again?  yeah sure.
yo, showtime, showtime!
what's going on?
welcome to our show!
hack the planet!
that's razor and blade.
razor and blade.
as you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
record the tones that the coins make. and hang up and get your money back!
and never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
...if it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
remember, hacking is more than just a crime. it's a survival trait!
how's it going, ray?
it looks good, sir. we've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
in english, please. i didn't spend ten years protecting the president so i could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
i'm sorry, sir. we caught him by surprise, so we don't think he had time to erase his computer files.
good. good man. alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
alright sir.
good morning, gentlemen. please be seated. i see we're still dressing in the dark, eugene.
once again, don't call me eugene.  a recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
precisely what you're paid to prevent.
someone didn't bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. now, as i so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love,  sex, secret and...  ...god. so would your holiness care to change her password?
a hacker planted the virus.
virus?
yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
excuse me?
the little boat flipped over. a virus planted in the gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
what, it left a note?
so what are we supposed to do?
well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. i traced the hacker's call. the secret service picked him up this morning. i'll just search his files for the original virus code, and then i can eliminate it.
what the hell was that all about?
i had to move fast. the hacker copied my garbage file.
what?
i created mister da vinci so we could call in the secret service. so they'd arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can't do on our own.
i don't want to go to jail for this.
relax. think about the 25 million dollars.
but you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
basically, uhmm, yeah. mmm hmmm.
jesus. you know, you're sick, eugene. you...
sh, sh sh sh sh.
did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
no. he's either very smart or very stupid.
then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice. we'll release him until his indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see if he leads us to your disc.
listen to this bullshit.  "this is our world now. the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. we exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. you wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals. yes, i am a criminal. my crime is that of curiosity. i am a hacker and this is my manifesto." huh, right, manifesto? "you may stop me, but you can't stop us all."
now that's cool.
cool?
yeah, cool.
you think it's cool?
it's cool!
it's not cool. it's commie bullshit!
so what do you think, can i crash at your place tonight?
what is it with this guy?
his parents missed woodstock and he's been making up for it since. hey, you hear about joey's bust?
yeah. probably had something to do with that bank in idaho.
do you think he could hack a gibson?
did you talk to him?
nope. his mom said he's grounded for his next three lifetimes.  he isn't to consort with his computer friends.  the secret service is really out to get him.  hey there's a big party tonight, you wanna go?
gill.
i think we've got something.
secret service!
don't move!
it got you seven years probation. no computer, couldn't even use a touch tone phone.
must have been hell, huh? zero cool?  a virus has been planted in the ellingson mineral computer system. you were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
however, we have come to believe that one joey pardella is involved in this ellingson virus. he or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that mr. belford needs to disable that virus. we want you to help us find it.
gill.
loser.  i can't believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. it's quite an impressive virus. dade, i know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we're hackers. for us, there's no such thing as family and friends. we're each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. i'd like to make a treaty with you.
i'm sorry. who are you?
i'm the one who understands you. now, can we be allies?
nah. i don't play well with others.
shit! come on!
watch which friends you do play with. a record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. no future. exiled from everyone and everything you love.
i'm fine.  oh, and dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
blow me.
thank you!
look out, man. lisa blair, 26 east 7th st., apartment 16, 555-4817, boom!
how did you know that?
i got photographic memory.  it's a curse!  lisa!
yo. check this out guys, this is insanely great, it's got a 28.8 bps modem!
yeah? display?
active matrix, man. a million psychedelic colors. man, baby, sweet, ooo!
i want it.
i want it to have my children!
yeah, i bet it looks crispy in the dark.
yo, hit the lights.
shit!
shh!
was that her top?
one-handed!
difficulty rating?
seven. wow! burn's wetware matches her software!
burn!
hey! what are you guys doing in here?
i'm sorry, we're sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
right.
the sensitive type.
what is he doing in here?
relax, burn, he's my guest.
burn. you're acid burn. you booted me out of otv!
what?
i'm crash override.
you're the moron that's been invading my turf?
murphy kid turn you down?
i disguised myself as an alabama state trooper and penetrated the fbi ncic.
pervert! what are you talking about?
the fbi computer holds files on twenty million americans.  i just hacked into it.
congratulations.
from here i got access to every piece of data ever stored on dade murphy's parents. his parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. hmm.
so?
so, we get the mother, we get the boy.
what the hell are you doing?
it's cool, i'm just looking.
it's too much machine for you.
yeah?
it has a killer refresh rate.
p6 chip. triple the speed of the pentium.
yeah. it's not just the chip, it has a pci bus. but you knew that.
indeed. risc architecture is gonna change everything.
yeah. risc is good.
you sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
crash override. what was it. "mess with the best, die like the rest?"
yeah.
are you challenging me?
name your stakes.
if i win, you become my slave.
your slave?
you wish. you'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever i want.
and if i win?
make it my first born.
make it our first date.
you're not gonna win.
and you have to smile.
i don't do dates. but i don't lose either, so you're on.
any questions?
yeah. whose gonna notify his next of kin?
dead.
dead?
yeah. like rigor mortis, habeas corpus.
very impressive.
super hero like even.
due to mr. gill's untimely demise and everything, i guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
right. if i win, you wear a dress on our date.
yo, what's up?
dude dude dude, i gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. i copied a garbage file from...
big deal. a garbage file's got shit in it, joey, come on.
nono, it's like hot or something. i don't know.
joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. junk. bits of stuff that's been erased, man.
i copied it from ellingson, okay? they're asking me about it, alright? will you take a look for me?
hello, operator services.
hello, operator? i'm having trouble dialing a number.
what number please?
555-4202.
just one moment.
thank you.
hello?
hey, it's me.
phreak?
i'm freaking! joey wasn't making it up! he really hacked into ellingson! he gave me the disc with a file he copied and now i'm in jail! they're charging me with some serious shit! and there's stuff i didn't even do, like inserting some virus called da vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
you think they're going to bust us?
yeah! you better figure out what's on that disc, cause we're being framed. it's in that place where i put that thing that time?
we need your help.
do my ears deceive me?
nonononono. truce, you guys. listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? a wake up call for the nintendo generation. we demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. when i was a child, i spake as a child, i understood as a child, i thought as a child, but when i became a man i put away childish things.  what... it's corinthians i, chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. come on.
phreak and joey are being framed. we need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
i can't. everybody who touches that thing gets busted, i can't afford to get arrested, i'm sorry.
maybe i should just go to the bathroom or something.
what is it with you? i know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. i really need your help.
i'm sorry, i can't.
well, could you just make a copy of the disc? and just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? can you do that?
thank you.
okay. i'll copy it.
okay, thank you.
the girl. the girl has the disc i need.
i told you, i don't play well with others.
turn on your laptop. set it to receive a file.
lauren murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of washington. forgery, embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. when she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. then i change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
that's bullshit.
what can i tell you. computers never lie, kid. your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
you lay a finger on her and i'll kill you.
kid, don't threaten me. there are worse things than death and, uh, i can do all of them!
talk to me.
i got it. but listen, kate didn't know what's on it. i mean, she came to me to figure it out. she's not the one who planted the virus. you leave her alone.
hey, don't worry, kid. if she's innocent, she'll be fine. your mommy's safe now, okay?
kate, listen.
uh, hold on...
i have to tell you something.
hold on a second!
look at this, it's so lean and clean.
looks like a hacker wrote it.
this isn't a virus. it's a worm!
what's this one eat?
it nibbles. you see this?
this is every financial transaction ellingson conducts, yeah? from million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
the worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
and no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. it's just data being shifted around.
right. and when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
joey got cut off before he got to that part. check it out. by this point, it's already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
two days.
and judging by this segment alone, it's already eaten about...
whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. and that's phreak, and that's joey, and that's us. we've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out who created it.
i know, i know who wrote it.
what?
this ellingson security creep. i gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
you what?
i didn't know what was on it.
oh man. that's universally stupid, man!
yo, man, you an amateur, man.
why did he come to you?
i got a record. i was zero cool.
biggest crash in history, front page, new york times, august 10th, 1988. i thought you was black, man! yo, man, this is zero cool! oh, shit!
that's far out!
this is zero cool, man! whooo, haha!
well that's great. there goes mit.
i'll make it up to you!
how?
i'll hack the gibson.
they'll trace you like that  man, cops are gonna find you, they're gonna find you with a smoking gun.
fucked if i care, man.
look, even if you had the passwords, it'll take you ten minutes to get in, and you've still gotta find the files, man, i mean, the cops will have you in... five minutes.
oh wow, we are fried.
never send a boy to do a woman's job. with me, we can do it in seven.
you're both screwed. i help, we can do it in six.
jesus, i gotta save all your asses. i help, we can do it in five minutes, man.
okay. let's go shopping.
shit!!
it's my subway defense system.
ta-da!
yo, brain dead, the manual!
they had a large chunk of the garbage file? how much do they know?
not everything. but enough to implicate us.
you said the worm was untreaceable!
yeah. to civilians. but they're hackers. but don't worry. all we have to do is launch the da vinci virus, and then they'll all be put away.
launch the da vinci virus? you can't do that!
no one believes the guilty. besides, by the time they realize the truth, we'll be long gone with all of our money.
snoop onto them...
...as they snoop onto us.
alright, so what have we got?
well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever polaroid head here got inside ellingson.
well, i got a lot, alright? i don't know how many but... my head hurts.
yo, everyone check this out. hey, what's the da vinci virus?
what?
check this out. it's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
well this hasn't happened yet.
wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run.  i mean... da vinci virus, didn't phreak say that's what he was being charged with? look...  "infecting ballast programs of ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers!
damn!
a worm and a virus? the plot thickens.
there they are!
razor and blade! they're flakes!
they're elite! let's get 'em.
let's keep her.
waste the dude.
a virus called da vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 am eastern time tomorrow.
it's somehow connected with the worm that's stealing the money.
we need your help to overload the gibson so we can kill the da vinci virus and download the worm program.
she's rabid, but cute.
see, we're very busy. a tv network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
that's it! an electronic army! if i were us, i'd get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
hackers of the world, unite!
how are you going to take care of the cops?
ai! boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?
cereal.
yeah?
go fix the phones.
roger.
ready?
yeah.
alright, let's boot up.
what is it? what's wrong?
nothing, it's just a minor glitch.
"minor glitch" with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.
there's a new virus in the database.
what's happening?
it's replicating, eating up memory. what do i do?
we have a zero bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
run anti-virus. give me a systems display!
die, dickweeds!
the rabbit is in the administration system.
send a flu-shot.
rabbit, flu-shot, someone talk to me.
a rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
cancer?
it's the gibson, it's finding us too fast.
man, there's too many garbage files, i need more time.
game's over. last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  you're not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
yeah, maybe i'm not. but we are, you asshole.
give it up! just give it up.
colonel who?
the system command processor, it's the brain.
cancer, brain... brain cancer?
i found it! i found it!
this is the end, my friend.  thank you for calling!
oh, shit! he got me.
joey's getting stupid busy.
yes!
we did it!
hello?
we caught 'em.
good.
red handed! you won't be having any more trouble from them.
are you crazy? what are you doing?
i'm trying to help you.
dade.
what?
thanks for your help.
oh, wow, she's great.
yeah.
you're welcome.
what's going on? let go of me! stewardess! i'll never fly this airline again!
you look good in a dress.
you would have looked better.
wanna go for a swim?
i can't believe they decided you won.
they didn't. the guys felt it was the only way i'd get a date. anyway, you're pretty good. you're elite.
yeah? you know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
you know, i've been having these really weird..
dreams?
