anyways, guys, guys, listen, listen to me. I am in this computer right? so I am looking around...
d'you bring those crayola books?
what is that?
devil book. the unix bible.
what is that?
dragon book. compiler design.
oh yeah? what is that?
the red book. nsa trusted networks. otherwise known as the ugly red book that will not fit on a shelf.
what are you, stoned or stupid? you do not hack a bank across state lines from your house, you will get nailed by the fbi. where are your brains, in your ass? do not you know anything?
stupid, man. it is universally stupid.
you guys always think i should know everything, and you never tell me anything. am i right?
alright, what are the three most commonly used passwords?
love, secret, and uh, sex.  but not in that order, necessarily, right?
yeah but do not forget god. system operators love to use god. it is that whole male ego thing.
look, you wanna be elite? you gotta do a righteous hack. none of this accidental shit.
oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack, you score one of those gibsons man. you know, supercomputers they use to like, do physics, and look for oil and stuff?
am not no way, man, security's too tight. the big iron?
maybe. but, if i were going to hack some heavy metal, i'd, uh, work my way back through some low security, and try the back door.
yeah but oh man,  would not you just love to get one of those gibsons, baby? ooooh!
cereal, man, you owe me a pack.
it was him, man!
you are psyched. you need to lay off of that shit.
I am going to hit you!
mr. belford?
my name is the plague.
uh, mr. the plague, uh, something weird's happening on the net.
as in what, you hapless techno-weenie?
uh, the accounting subdirectory in the gibson is working really hard. we got one person online, the workload is enough for like ten users. i think we have got a hacker.
never fear. i is here.
I have narrowed the activity to terminal 23.
let's echo 23, see what is up.
you heard of a hacker called acid burn? you know who he is?
no, do not know who he is.  do you?
crash override.
never heard of you. done anything?
no.
uh... nikon, can i... can i crash at your place tonight?
again?  yeah sure.
yo, showtime, showtime!
what is going on?
welcome to our show!
hack the planet!
that is razor and blade.
razor and blade.
as you can see, this is just a simple microcassette recorder.   hook it up to the phone and drop in five bucks in quarters.
record the tones that the coins make. and hang up and get your money back!
and never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
...if it were not run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
remember, hacking is more than just a crime. it is a survival trait!
how is it going, ray?
it looks good, sir. we have got an uncorrupted hard drive.
in english, please. i did not spend ten years protecting the president so i could finish my career feeling like an idiot.
I am sorry, sir. we caught him by surprise, so we do not think he had time to erase his computer files.
good. good man. alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
alright sir.
good morning, gentlemen. please be seated. i see we are still dressing in the dark, eugene.
once again, do not call me eugene.  a recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
precisely what you are paid to prevent.
someone did not bother reading my carefully prepared memo on commonly used passwords. now, as i so meticulously pointed out, the for most used passwords are love,  sex, secret and...  ...god. so would your holiness care to change her password?
a hacker planted the virus.
virus?
yesterday, the ballast program for a supertanker training model mistakenly thought the vessel was empty, and flooded its tanks.
excuse me?
the little boat flipped over. a virus planted in the gibson computer system claimed responsibility.
what, it left a note?
so what are we supposed to do?
well luckily, you have a gifted and talented security officer. i traced the hacker's call. the secret service picked him up this morning. I will just search his files for the original virus code, and then i can eliminate it.
what the hell was that all about?
i had to move fast. the hacker copied my garbage file.
what?
i created mister da vinci so we could call in the secret service. so they would arrest the hacker, sieze his equipment, things that we can not do on our own.
i do not want to go to jail for this.
relax. think about the 25 million dollars.
but you have created a virus that is going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
basically, uhmm, yeah. mmm hmmm.
jesus. you know, you are sick, eugene. you...
sh, sh sh sh sh.
did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
no. he is either very smart or very stupid.
then he stashed it somewhere, or he has an accomplice. we will release him until his indictment, keep tight surveillance, and see if he leads us to your disc.
listen to this bullshit.  "this is our world now. the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud. we exist without nationality, skin color, or religious bias. you wage wars, murder, cheat, lie to us and try to make us believe it is for our own good, yet we are the criminals. yes, i am a criminal. my crime is that of curiosity. i am a hacker and this is my manifesto." huh, right, manifesto? "you may stop me, but you can not stop us all."
now that is cool.
cool?
yeah, cool.
you think it is cool?
it is cool!
it is not cool. it is commie bullshit!
so what do you think, can i crash at your place tonight?
what is it with this guy?
his parents missed woodstock and he is been making up for it since. hey, you hear about joey's bust?
yeah. probably had something to do with that bank in idaho.
do you think he could hack a gibson?
did you talk to him?
nope. his mom said he is grounded for his next three lifetimes.  he is not to consort with his computer friends.  the secret service is really out to get him.  hey there is a big party tonight, you wanna go?
gill.
i think we have got something.
secret service!
do not move!
it got you seven years probation. no computer, could not even use a touch tone phone.
must have been hell, huh? zero cool?  a virus has been planted in the ellingson mineral computer system. you were our prime suspect, till we trashed your stuff and found no trace of it.
however, we have come to believe that one joey pardella is involved in this ellingson virus. he or perhaps his accomplice has a disk that mr. belford needs to disable that virus. we want you to help us find it.
gill.
loser.  i can not believe you were only eleven when you wrote this. it is quite an impressive virus. dade, i know how you might feel about narking on your friends, but, we are hackers. for us, there is no such thing as family and friends. we are each our own country, with temporary allies and enemies. I would like to make a treaty with you.
I am sorry. who are you?
I am the one who understands you. now, can we be allies?
nah. i do not play well with others.
shit! come on!
watch which friends you do play with. a record like yours could land you in jail, get you kicked out of school, no colleges would take you. no future. exiled from everyone and everything you love.
I am fine.  oh, and dade, try to stay out of trouble, okay?
blow me.
thank you!
look out, man. lisa blair, 26 east 7th st., apartment 16, 555-4817, boom!
how did you know that?
i got photographic memory.  it is a curse!  lisa!
yo. check this out guys, this is insanely great, it is got a 28.8 bps modem!
yeah? display?
active matrix, man. a million psychedelic colors. man, baby, sweet, ooo!
i want it.
i want it to have my children!
yeah, i bet it looks crispy in the dark.
yo, hit the lights.
shit!
shh!
was that her top?
one-handed!
difficulty rating?
seven. wow! burn's wetware matches her software!
burn!
hey! what are you guys doing in here?
I am sorry, we are sorry, just checking out your fly laptop!
right.
the sensitive type.
what is he doing in here?
relax, burn, he is my guest.
burn. you are acid burn. you booted me out of otv!
what?
I am crash override.
you are the moron that is been invading my turf?
murphy kid turn you down?
i disguised myself as an alabama state trooper and penetrated the fbi ncic.
pervert! what are you talking about?
the fbi computer holds files on twenty million americans.  i just hacked into it.
congratulations.
from here i got access to every piece of data ever stored on dade murphy's parents. his parents separated five years ago, reconciled two years later, filed for divorce last year, custody battle, boy chose to go with his mother. hmm.
so?
so, we get the mother, we get the boy.
what the hell are you doing?
it is cool, I am just looking.
it is too much machine for you.
yeah?
it has a killer refresh rate.
p6 chip. triple the speed of the pentium.
yeah. it is not just the chip, it has a pci bus. but you knew that.
indeed. risc architecture is gonna change everything.
yeah. risc is good.
you sure this sweet machine's not going to waste?
crash override. what was it. "mess with the best, die like the rest?"
yeah.
are you challenging me?
name your stakes.
if i win, you become my slave.
your slave?
you wish. you will do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever i want.
and if i win?
make it my first born.
make it our first date.
you are not going to win.
and you have to smile.
i do not do dates. but i do not lose either, so you are on.
any questions?
yeah. whose gonna notify his next of kin?
dead.
dead?
yeah. like rigor mortis, habeas corpus.
very impressive.
super hero like even.
due to mr. gill's untimely demise and everything, i guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
right. if i win, you wear a dress on our date.
yo, what is up?
dude dude dude, i gotta talk to you a minute, listen listen listen. i copied a garbage file from...
big deal. a garbage file's got shit in it, joey, come on.
nono, it is like hot or something. i do not know.
joey, a garbage file holds miscellaneous data. junk. bits of stuff that is been erased, man.
i copied it from ellingson, okay? they are asking me about it, alright? will you take a look for me?
hello, operator services.
hello, operator? I am having trouble dialing a number.
what number please?
555-4202.
just one moment.
thank you.
hello?
hey, it is me.
phreak?
I am freaking! joey was not making it up! he really hacked into ellingson! he gave me the disc with a file he copied and now I am in jail! they are charging me with some serious shit! and there is stuff i did not even do, like inserting some virus called da vinci, and they keep asking about you guys.
you think they are going to bust us?
yeah! you better figure out what is on that disc, cause we are being framed. it is in that place where i put that thing that time?
we need your help.
do my ears deceive me?
nonononono. truce, you guys. listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? a wake up call for the nintendo generation. we demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. when i was a child, i spake as a child, i understood as a child, i thought as a child, but when i became a man i put away childish things.  what... it is corinthians i, chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. come on.
phreak and joey are being framed. we need your help to figure out what is on this disc.
i can't. everybody who touches that thing gets busted, i can not afford to get arrested, I am sorry.
maybe i should just go to the bathroom or something.
what is it with you? i know we have been playing games, but, we are supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. i really need your help.
I am sorry, i can't.
well, could you just make a copy of the disc? and just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that has not been tampered with? can you do that?
thank you.
okay. I will copy it.
okay, thank you.
the girl. the girl has the disc i need.
i told you, i do not play well with others.
turn on your laptop. set it to receive a file.
lauren murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of washington. forgery, embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. when she is arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. then i change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
that is bullshit.
what can i tell you. computers never lie, kid. your mom will be arrested at work, she will be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.
you lay a finger on her and I will kill you.
kid, do not threaten me. there are worse things than death and, uh, i can do all of them!
talk to me.
i got it. but listen, kate did not know what is on it. i mean, she came to me to figure it out. she is not the one who planted the virus. you leave her alone.
hey, do not worry, kid. if she is innocent, she will be fine. your mommy's safe now, okay?
kate, listen.
uh, hold on...
i have to tell you something.
hold on a second!
look at this, it is so lean and clean.
looks like a hacker wrote it.
this is not a virus. it is a worm!
what is this one eat?
it nibbles. you see this?
this is every financial transaction ellingson conducts, yeah? from million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
the worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
and no one's caught it because the money is not really gone. it is just data being shifted around.
right. and when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
joey got cut off before he got to that part. check it out. by this point, it is already running at, what, twice the speed as when it started.
right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
two days.
and judging by this segment alone, it is already eaten about...
whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. and that is phreak, and that is joey, and that is us. we have got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out who created it.
i know, i know who wrote it.
what?
this ellingson security creep. i gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
you what?
i did not know what was on it.
oh man. that is universally stupid, man!
yo, man, you an amateur, man.
why did he come to you?
i got a record. i was zero cool.
biggest crash in history, front page, new york times, august 10th, 1988. i thought you was black, man! yo, man, this is zero cool! oh, shit!
that is far out!
this is zero cool, man! whooo, haha!
well that is great. there goes mit.
I will make it up to you!
how?
I will hack the gibson.
they will trace you like that  man, cops are going to find you, they are going to find you with a smoking gun.
fucked if i care, man.
look, even if you had the passwords, it will take you ten minutes to get in, and you have still got to find the files, man, i mean, the cops will have you in... five minutes.
oh wow, we are fried.
never send a boy to do a woman's job. with me, we can do it in seven.
you are both screwed. i help, we can do it in six.
jesus, i gotta save all your asses. i help, we can do it in five minutes, man.
okay. let's go shopping.
shit!!
it is my subway defense system.
ta-da!
yo, brain dead, the manual!
they had a large chunk of the garbage file? how much do they know?
not everything. but enough to implicate us.
you said the worm was untreaceable!
yeah. to civilians. but they are hackers. but do not worry. all we have to do is launch the da vinci virus, and then they will all be put away.
launch the da vinci virus? you can not do that!
no one believes the guilty. besides, by the time they realize the truth, we will be long gone with all of our money.
snoop onto them...
...as they snoop onto us.
alright, so what have we got?
well, we have fifty passwords, plus whatever polaroid head here got inside ellingson.
well, i got a lot, alright? i do not know how many but... my head hurts.
yo, everyone check this out. hey, what is the da vinci virus?
what?
check this out. it is a memo about how they are going to deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
well this has not happened yet.
wait a minute, the fourteenth, that is the same day the worm ends its run.  i mean... da vinci virus, did not phreak say that is what he was being charged with? look...  "infecting ballast programs of ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers!
damn!
a worm and a virus? the plot thickens.
there they are!
razor and blade! they are flakes!
they are elite! let's get 'em.
let's keep her.
waste the dude.
a virus called da vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 am eastern time tomorrow.
it is somehow connected with the worm that is stealing the money.
we need your help to overload the gibson so we can kill the da vinci virus and download the worm program.
she is rabid, but cute.
see, we are very busy. a tv network that wishes to remain nameless has expressed an interest in our show.
that is it! an electronic army! if i were us, I would get on the internet, send out a major distress signal.
hackers of the world, unite!
how are you going to take care of the cops?
ai! boom boom aiaiaiaiaee! alright, that was a little tension breaker, that had to be done, alright?
cereal.
yeah?
go fix the phones.
roger.
ready?
yeah.
alright, let's boot up.
what is it? what is wrong?
nothing, it is just a minor glitch.
"minor glitch" with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.
there is a new virus in the database.
what is happening?
it is replicating, eating up memory. what do i do?
we have a zero bug attacking all the login and overlay files.
run anti-virus. give me a systems display!
die, dickweeds!
the rabbit is in the administration system.
send a flu-shot.
rabbit, flu-shot, someone talk to me.
a rabbit replicates till it overloads a file, then it spreads like cancer.
cancer?
it is the gibson, it is finding us too fast.
man, there is too many garbage files, i need more time.
game's over. last chance to get out of this without a prison sentence.  you are not good enough to beat me, you little shit.
yeah, maybe I am not. but we are, you asshole.
give it up! just give it up.
colonel who?
the system command processor, it is the brain.
cancer, brain... brain cancer?
i found it! i found it!
this is the end, my friend.  thank you for calling!
oh, shit! he got me.
joey's getting stupid busy.
yes!
we did it!
hello?
we caught 'em.
good.
red handed! you will not be having any more trouble from them.
are you crazy? what are you doing?
I am trying to help you.
dade.
what?
thanks for your help.
oh, wow, she is great.
yeah.
you are welcome.
what is going on? let go of me! stewardess! I will never fly this airline again!
you look good in a dress.
you would have looked better.
wanna go for a swim?
i can not believe they decided you won.
they didn't. the guys felt it was the only way I would get a date. anyway, you are pretty good. you are elite.
yeah? you know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
you know, I have been having these really weird..
dreams?
