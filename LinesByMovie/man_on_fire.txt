the family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later.  his father still has not gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass.
and now every mother with money in mexico city wants bigger and better bodyguards. my own wife included.
if she pisses you off, you get another one.
do you know what she told me last night?
a man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. only the amount matters.
and bankruptcy. where will that put me in the social strata?
I am only asking for one thing. and it is not an extravagance. it is not even for me; it is for our daughter.
our daughter.
our child's safety is at stake.
these people are professionals. they do not waste their time taking children whose fathers are virtually bankrupt.
samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. a bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. now he is gone, i feel totally exposed.
of course i care about pinta. she will be as beautiful as her mother one day.
yeah? and if she was ugly?
all my clients have kidnap and ransom insurance.
i have a policy, aig. it covers me and my family and when it runs out in sixty days, without a bodyguard, i will not be able to renew it.
i know you need to please lisa. an ass like that is hard to find. good bodyguards are even harder.
i know! i just had to let one go because i could not afford him!
you need a bodyguard of some description. it is a dangerous world we live in. but you will get what you pay for. he does not need to be superman, does he? can you go fifteen grand?
for a year?
for a few months. hire someone cheap. you have to have a bodyguard to keep the insurance. then fire him for incompetence. the important thing is lisa's daughter will return to school.
and lisa will be able to save face. we will not be the only family without a bodyguard.
her beauty fucks with your mind.
for an american she understands this country very well.
she understands men.
[where are you coming from?]
[south america.]
[where are you staying in mexico?]
[i'm on to juarez.]
[why?]
[i have a friend there.]
[senor?]
[it's a permit to carry a gun in columbia. the gun you are about to find in that suitcase.]
when did mexican customs start getting smart?
creasy??? where the fuck are you?
I am here.
what do you mean, I am here?
I am in a customs holding tank in mexico city international. bring a bunch of cash... about 5k. I am going to need it.
you got a secondary search and you had a gun.
listen it was a calculated risk. I have done it a million times and never got caught.
everything happens once if you live long enough.
it does not make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane.
this is mexico, they do everything backwards.
so what is wrong?
nothing wrong.
do not give me that bullshit.
so how is business?
japanese are here in a big way. cheap labor. factory space. but they feel a lot safer living over the border in el paso. i ferry 'em back and forth. they think I am john-fucking- wayne.
but do not you stay in el paso?
fuck, i love mexico. i live like a king down here.
yeah, right...
oh, like you have not been in worse places.
and a level five shithole is better than a level six. your logic's inescapable.
you been working?
not for eight months. i was in columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting.
how long you staying, crease?
got no plans, rayburn, nothing on. just wanted to see you, how you were. came by on impulse.
you did something on impulse?
everything happens once if you live long enough.
you should be sleeping, baby.
I am trying, mom.
good news. you are going back to school.
when?
samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. it may take a few days, but you are going back.
could he speak english? emilio could not speak english.
we will see. and thank your father in the morning. a man always needs to be thanked.
your spanish is good enough. you certainly look the part.
you are crazy. people would hire a has-been, ray? a drunk?
well, you would have to keep it under control.
and what if, just say, there was a kidnap attempt?
you do your best. they will not be paying you enough to perform miracles.
it is not exactly a scam, crease. even at half speed you are pretty damn good.
a bodyguard has to be close to someone all the time. willing to talk. I am not good at that.
so you will be the silent type. people will appreciate that.
what are you doing here?
i came to visit you.
bullshit. I have known you fifteen years. you do not visit.
a bodyguard... who is the guy?
samuel ramos. owns one of the plants in juarez. the jap car industry is in the toilet. he is trying to persuade ford to partner with him. i think he is in trouble. he asked me if i knew anyone he could trust.
oh, now you think i can be trusted.
take a job, creasy. breathe some air. then decide if you want to... stick around or not.
were you provided with a gun?
yes.
show me, please.
what is it?
nine millimeter. a sig sauer 226.
have you used this type before?
is it loaded?
it is loaded.
your resume is impressive. nine years in the army. extensive counter terrorism work. i should not be able to afford you in my current state. what is the catch?
i drink.
how does it affect you?
my coordination. reaction time. if top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay.
and what if amateurs try it?
I will probably kill them. is that likely?
no. and no one is to know of your drinking problem. that includes my wife.
the world of our children. how dare they?
it is war. the weakest suffer the most.
you are american.
so are you.
my wife, mr. creasy.
lisa martin ramos, mr. creasy.
you have done much of this work before?
never.
he has experience in related work. a great deal of it.
do you have any family, mr. creasy?
yes, mom?
this is mr. creasy.
i think it is nice he is american.
i think it is fantastic.
you realize that you have brought a killer into the house.
do you like dogs, mr. creasy?
if they like me.
frank does not take to most people. do you speak german?
ein klines bisschen. [a tiny bit.]
frank only responds to commands in german. he was trained in frankfurt. my dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside.
that is 'bird.' emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
who is emilio?
my last bodyguard. he drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon.
in between you can take mom shopping and to lunch. does that sound alright, mr. creasy?
creasy. just call me creasy.
creasy...
i like him, mom.
you do?
he is like a great big bear.  'creasy bear'...
i think he is been sick. he is alright now, but i think he is been very, very sick.
well, think about going to sleep. good night, baby.
she likes him.
hmm?
creasy. pinta likes him.
pinta loves school. she would like count dracula is he took her back there.
where are you from, creasy?
the united states.
i know. but which state?
no.
you can drive and talk at the same time, can not you?
no.
why not?
I am looking for potential.
potential? i do not understand.
places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. but you do not have to understand. i do. so no talking.
are you going to quit? my last bodyguard quit.
let me guess, you would not stop talking?
someone gave him more money than we could.
I am a bargain.
being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in mexico?
time will tell.
there were 24 kidnappings in mexico city in the last six days. four a day. what do you think about that, mr. creasy?
pretty impressive. maybe i need to up my fee or get a larger gun.
[she's late, mr. creasy.]
[yeah, I have got to get used to the routes. i -- it will not happen again.]
[no offense, but I am sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[so am i, sister.]
[do you ever see the hand of god in what you do?]
[not for a long time, sister.]
[the bible says, "be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good."]
[romans, chapter 12, verse 21.]
there is still ink on my fingers from last week.
you got tossed. do not trust the cops, especially the judicials.  oh you know that?
we are taking a different way home.
that is right.
did you like school, creasy?
no.
not at all?
no.
but why not?
hmmm?
it was not a school like yours and there was no sister anna.
so you were unhappy?
being unhappy is a state of mind. i never thought about it.
oh...
and do not start crying.
I am not crying.
mr. creasy, i wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
I am fine.
is the food alright? maria tells me that you did not eat.
the food's fine. sometimes i do not eat.
it insults maria. slip it to the dog if you have to... do you mind if i talk to you for a moment?
how are you getting along with pinta?
we will be okay once she realizes I am not a new toy.
yes, she told me. do you have children, mr. creasy?
no.
you should know they are tenacious when they want something. and pinta wants to be friends.
you are paying me to protect her, not amuse her. right?
look. maybe this is not going to work. maybe you should ask your husband to hire someone... more sociable.
no, you are right. you were hired to protect her, that is enough. I am confident you will do that.
it makes it all seem so serious.
it is serious, mrs. ramos.
please, it is lisa... I will be coming with you tomorrow. i have lunch with friends.
you mean a misfire?
i mean nothing. the hammer came down and nothing happened. dimple on the primer.
I have heard of it. never happened to me though. maybe the firing pin's off.
maybe...
creasy?
sorry i woke you, ray.
pinta, do you have a pencil?
i go to school, do not i?
sorry.
the traffic takes some getting used to.
bye, mom.
do not forget your towel.
jordan!
if something happened, my reaction would be to fight to protect her. i have skills in that respect. pinta would benefit by the fact that... I am a soldier.
you are fast.
once i get in the water but not starting off. by the time i catch up, it is too late.
what are you doing?
calling for emilio's macaw. i thought i heard him.
do you think he will come back?
maybe. did you hear him?
no.
how do you think he got out?
well, i let him go.
it is better to be free, right?
yes. actually, he was driving me crazy.
I will call you from detroit, baby.
you are going to miss mexican halloween. the day of the dead.
they will be back in a week.
they can stay for two weeks. i do not care.
it hurts.
where?
everywhere!
i do not think they are broken. anywhere else?
my ankle.
the night you arrived, mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, did not you?
white lie. i did not have a family. but i did have two kids. they are adults now.
do you always sleep with him?
I am too old for him. do not tell my friends.
i do not talk to them much. does he have a name?
did you sleep alright?
yes.
how is the ankle? can you put your weight on it?
it is not too bad. will it take a long time before it is better? our big swim meet is in three weeks. interschools. i was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
in a week you should be fine.
does not matter. i always finish second.
you need to practice.
why do you ask?
it was in a book at school. concubine.
well, it is a sort of wife.
but the emperor of china had 1000 of them! how can that be?
in the west, it is one wife for one husband, but different cultures have different rules.
it must be difficult having lots of wives.
you feel sorry for the husband?
[yeah. can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand?]
so how come you know so much about those countries?
i had to do my homework on them when i worked there. also i enjoy history.
what did you do in asia? is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
no, that was in columbia.
you do not flinch when a gun goes off; you react. you go. do not listen for the sound; do not anticipate it. concentrate on the sound itself.
i do not understand.
do not worry. you will.
remember you asked me what state i was from?
yes.
where you are from is not so much about geography; it is about events. where you are from is what happened to you.
good things happen, too, creasy.  like meeting me.
i guess that really does make me a hard case.
do you have a girlfriend, creasy?
no.
did you used to?
yeah. two or three.
you are late.
I am sorry.
you were never late before, i was worried.
where is my mother?
i dropped her at home.
it is no wonder you are late. why did not she just come with you?
I am not afraid you, creasy.
i know you are not.
are you afraid of me?
the gunshot holds no fear. say it.
the gunshot holds no fear.
you welcome the sound. the sound is what lets you go. the sound is what frees you. you are a prisoner in those blocks until you hear the sound.
I am tough, creasy. I am tough as you.
there is no such thing as tough. you are either trained or untrained.
what is so important in los angeles?
your father has business.
why today? and why did she have to go with him?
the blocks.
I am a prisoner in them. until the gunshot sets me free.
then one day, he calls and says, 'i'm in love and I am moving to mexico.' i said what happened to the plan?
i said the plan was right here.
could i ask you a question?
could i stop you?
you do not drink like you used to.
that is not a question.
i know because i go in your room and check the bottles.
still not a question.
my mom drinks, too... why do people drink, creasy?
now that is a question. i do not know about your mom. for me, the problem is not in the glass. the problem's in between my ears.
you think too much?
yeah. because at one time, i did not think enough.
he has to go, samuel.
what? who?
creasy.
why? you were so pleased with him.
pinta likes him too much.  she thinks of him as a father.
that is ridiculous.
it is not.
I have just been so busy, lisa.
he has to go.
it will be a hard break.
she is young. she will get over it.
i was not thinking of pinta.
pinta, we have got to go. travel sucks at this time.
frank. frankie.
that is strange. frank was a no-show. not like him to miss a ride.
you should break all my fingers, creasy, then tape them back together. i will not be able to play the piano, but i could still swim.
do not be a baby. you are tougher than that.
there is no such thing as tough, creasy. just trained and untrained.
then be trained.
I am going to keep people safe someday. just like you.
be a swimmer.
i could do it. remember the day you wanted the pencil? i know why. and i saw that car again. i wrote the license number in my notebook. except i missed the last number.
continue to play in the wrong key, like you are dyslexic.
dyslexic?
like st. jude. a hopeless case that has a complete block about 'c' minor. but remember, "whoever resists authority will bring judgement upon themselves." new testament, romans 13.
you got that right.
you will be back in the water in twenty- four hours.
[a bodyguard was shot trying to protect a 9 year old. the bodyguard's american. not only that he is black.]
[is that good or bad?]
[that's good. really good. he shot and killed two judicial cops and a kidnapper died in the attack. they are saying he is responsible.]
he is not a cop killer.
I am sure he isn't. though he is certainly adept at killing.
he was doing his job, protecting the girl. if police were involved, you figure it out. I am here for him.
so am i.
you got three of the fuckers. all dead.
pinta...
two days gone. they are negotiating a ransom.
[you have the money.]
[yes.]
[ok, repeat the drop instructions.]
[the money, 10 million u.s. will be divided into two 15 gallon black canvas bags each containing five million which will be checked at the bank by the k&r agent. then driven to the house in an armored car where it will be transferred to the delivery car.]
[the car will not be powerful and have no trunk.]
[i need a driver to drive samuel, the father.]
[no. why?]
[he has a heart condition. angina. he responds badly to stress.]
[ok. you will arrive at columbus circle and reforma avenue at 3am. you will drive around the square two times. samuel will remove his shirt and hold it out the window to i.d. the car.]
what am i doing here?
believe it or not, you are safe here. the judicial police will kill you. if they can.  this page?
no.
you have a rather checkered past. mr. creasy. your interpol file is six pages long.
am i a suspect?
no. it would be convenient, but no.
show me mugshots of mexican policemen. maybe then we will get somewhere.
all these photos you just saw were of policemen. sadly they are protected. la hermanidad. the brotherhood.
stomach's gone. but... okay.
I will get you up to the border. friend of mine'll take you in to san diego. drop you right at the hospital.
a lot of people are looking for you.
i guess that makes you the smart one.
we are interested in the same thing. I am writing a story.
it is santa muerte. death worship. the religion of la hermanidad. there is a curse on you.
it is a little late.
why are you here? why did not you die?
because...  i was already dead.
fuck. look at you; you will not last a day the shape you are in. unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
yes or no?
i will not kill again. hunt people. i gave that up. anything else? it is yours.
I will take the .45 and the webley .32.
i know it is old fashioned, but it is reliable. like us.
cut the stock here. the barrel here. make sure you file it smooth.  rocket launchers?
different door. not far from here.
maybe i can help your situation and you mine.
so where do we begin?
i need the name and address of the owner of a toyota corolla, license number me31704... we did not get the last digit so i need the ten possible matches.
so what do i get in return?
let's see how the relationship develops. I will call you in the am. thanks.
[he'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[he sounded strong to me. stronger than we are.]
[because he is outside. because he is not tied to the same system we are.]
[we did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. the same man 'the dreamer'. listen to this.]
[i know this. your point?]
[creasy is not a policeman. my sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
[then what do you have to lose?]
[it's a moral issue. on one hand you are cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
[drive.]
[do you know who i am?]
[you are jorge ramirez.]
[do you know who i am?]
[who are you?]
[i am the president of la hermanidad.]
[the ramos kidnapping. how did it work?]
[i do not know. we were just given instructions to take her.]
[ordered by who?]
[i do not know! we work in parts. a voice calls in a kidnapping. we deliver the target to the guardians. we do not even know them. they might transfer to other guardians. the negotiators and the bosses do not even see the target. they just make the deal!]
[who ordered it?]
[the cops call him 'the dreamer'.]
[where do i find him?]
[i do not know. no one knows.]
[i do not know, i swear.]
[i believe you.]
[i'm professional. i just do my job.]
[me, too. tell me about the guardians.]
[he called me on the cell phone to set a time and location for the switch.]
[who's he?]
[the one who transferred pinta to their car.]
who is he?
i do not know, but i know his face.
[i see him sometimes at the handball court in chapultepec on a saturday afternoon.]
[how do i recognize him.]
[he has a tattoo covering two-thirds of his back. he is part of the brotherhood.]
[in the next hour, where do i find your partner?]
[one-one-three arco iris. third floor.]
[how does it work?]
[everything on the cellphone. we wait for calls. we have no number to call.]
[who pays you?]
[we have an atm bank card. we draw out 300 dollars every two weeks.]
[what's the pin number?]
[the what?]
[the number you use at the bank machine.]
[four-seven-four-seven.]
[who killed her? you?]
[no!]
[don't lie to me.]
[the boss did or his brother.]
[who's the boss?]
[we do not know! we never see his face! we have to wait in the other room. he was screaming to the girl that...]
[what money?]
[the ransom money. at the drop. he said tazinari, one of the policemen had taken it. he was crazy.]
[who's tazinari?]
[head of the anti-kidnapping division.]
rosanna guerrero.
it is creasy.
where are you?
los arcos. was a little girl kidnapped recently? about twelve maybe?
last night. do you know something?
what was her name?
camila. camila valencias.
i need something. do you have banking connections?
i have connections.
where do i find you?
I will call you tomorrow.
what do you know about the cop? tazinari. the one who made the ransom drop with samuel ramos?
he is an old fashioned patrone with the worst reputation. he is high on my hit list.
where does he live?
he lives in a judicial compound. he travels by motorcade. he has better protection than george bush. even more importantly he is part of la hermanidad. his reach is far and wide.
give me the address.
pollo pibil. chicken and chorizo sausage. hmmmh. they marinate it in lemon and orange juice. it is a stew really.
i already ate.
tell me about your friend creasy.
you just said it. he is my friend. nothing else to say.
i read the file. you and creasy have been seen quite a bit together.
two tourists who never went home.
you helped him get this job.
that is what friends do.
yes. but if i traced creasy to you, others will do it as well. their facilities are as good as my own, if not better.
i can take care of myself.
you and creasy both. a two man army according to interpol. panama. lebanon with the druze. desert storm. where you were contracted by the u.s. army to hunt down elite iraqi military commanders.  you two were a married couple.
the kind that gets divorced, but still stay friends.
what happened to him? what happened to creasy?
none of your business. or mine for that matter. i got nothing more to say.
this is my jurisdiction. i want these men as much as creasy does.
he will deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. so stay out of his way.
i plan to. I will even help him if i can. he is going to lead me to the 'the dreamer'. someone i want very badly. but I would like to understand him. give me that.
pinta martin ramos is just a number to you. tragic, a public outcry, but a number. one more dead.
what was she to creasy then?
light. at the end of a long, dark tunnel. somehow, she showed him it was alright to live again.
and they took that away.
a man can be an artist in anything. stone, paint, words. food. anything if his soul is true to it. creasy's art is death. and he is about to paint his masterpiece.
[is it true? creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.]
[and left three more dead men.]
[when you talked to him, did he look sane?]
[no. not by the rules of polite society at least.]
[i think he's... magnificent.]
[you only fuck me to get information.]
[you only give information so you can fuck me.]
[a beautiful circle.]
[and as long as we are talking information, there is something else as well.]
[i should start going for your tits first.]
[do you know who i am? i am the commandante of the judicial anti- kidnapping division.]
[and one of the founding members of la hermanidad.]
[correct!]
[please, don't...]
[it's all up to you, commandante. tell me about you and 'the dreamer'.]
[i do not know him. i saw the opportunity and got lucky.]
[lucky how?]
[that he used policemen. that you killed them, it made it a police matter. the ramos family could not refuse our involvement.]
[and?]
[and i had my men ready.]
[you stole the drop.]
[yes. many times.]
[o.k. so tell me more.]
[there was no ten million dollars.]
[the ransom was ten.]
[two and a half. that is how much there was.]
[don't lie to me!]
[two and a half! the rest was paper! strips of paper!]
[maybe your men stole from you.]
[no. whoever took the rest took it before the exchange.]
[who gave the bags to ramos?]
[his lawyer. jordan kalfus.]
[that's all i know! please. I am sorry for the girl. but it was business! I am a professional.]
[that's what everybody keeps saying.]
another favor... get me banking info on jordan kalfus. u.s. deposits or withdrawals. thanks. oh, get me the same on samuel ramos.
how do i contact you? we still do not have the atm info.
you don't, I will call you. oh! i have a tape recording that i am sure will interest you.
they planned it, samuel and kalfus.
planned what?
an autosequestra. kalfus arranged for pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I am sure he thought she would sit there for three days eating pizza and watching tv. it did not work out that way. everything got fucked up when i killed the cops and tazinari saw an opportunity.
i traced the pin. i have an address for you. but i need to see you.
i show, you give me the information?
deal.
where?
[who's that?]
[he's the man, 'the boss?' my guys got into the house on the pretext of giving cholera shots. we had to inject the whole barrio. we bugged the house and stole the picture of him.]
hombre en fuego. man on fire. that is what the papers have named you.
it is what you and rosanna named me. right?
sit, creasy. everything that happens from now on does so with my permission.  really. you will not find a better carne asada in all of mexico.
the last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
what do you want?
the same thing as you. except, my reach is not as long as yours. my father was a policemen, did you know that?
i do not know shit about you.
he was one of the original founders of 'le hermanidad' in the days when it represented good not evil.
my family lives in miami. because of the death threats.
it is not worth it. be with them instead.
it galls me to watch you. you can do as much in days as i can in years. men like the 'the dreamer' are protected. out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
my country needs justice. proper justice. gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. they need to be brought to trial. dealt with properly. then people will respect the law. when they see it works.
so you are going to talk me to death.
you walk out and deal justice. you are what i wish i could be.  the policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
then i hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. what do you want?
i want to arrest you for murder! i want to shake your hand and reload your gun! i want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
my deal is with rosanna. i knew you guys were up to something. are you two fucking?
no, but i have to admit i thought about it.
liar. just tell me who the bank card belongs to. name and address.
you have no interest in making things easy, do you?
I am not... easy.
creasy...  I would have liked to have known you under different circumstances.
off the top of my head, i do not know what they could have been.
[reina rosas.]
[si.]
[how do you contact 'the boss'?]
[we page him and he calls back on this cell phone.]
[what is his name?]
[daniel.]
[daniel what?]
[daniel rosas sanchez.]
[so you are married to him? and this looks remarkably like his brother.]
[what is his name?]
[aurillio rosas sanchez.]
[hello daniel. I have got your family and i want to negotiate.]
[mr. creasy. what do you want?]
[i want you.]
[how much do you want?]
[it's non-negotiable.]
[two million u.s.... three million u.s.?]
[i told you, non-negotiable.]
[the most important thing in life is family. and there you are. you have my family. what do you want?]
[i want you.]
[this is not possible. but in that house i have money. if i tell you where --]
[your brother wants to talk to you.]
[yeah.  yes.]
[listen! i will give you a life for a life.]
[what do you mean?]
[her life for your life.]
[the girl's. pinta's.]
[you're a liar. pinta's dead.]
[i'm a businessman. a dead girl is worth nothing. she is alive.]
i do not believe you.
i want you to get into your car now and meet me on the south end of the footbridge between reforma and the freeway junction. in 45 minutes.
you are lying. i do not believe you.
then do not come.
creasy... wait.
stay here. if you do something stupid, we will not get her back.
