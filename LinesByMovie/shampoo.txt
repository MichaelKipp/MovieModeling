oh, no.
... what?...
that headboard.
nobody can hear it.
you going to answer it?
uh-uh.
want me to?
let it ring.
what took you so long?
was not sure it was you.

i... uh... i... uh... can't.
all right, who are you with? jill?
no.

no.
awww --
I will call you back.
come on by.
I will call you back...

okay, okay...
you are rude. i mean, you are very rude.
hey, i tried to get her off the phone.
you know what I am talking about.
no, baby. now look, that girl that called -- i have to talk to her, she will do something.
like what?
i do not know, kill herself. she is o.d.'d four times.
well, is she your girlfriend?
no.
are you in love with her?
her?
are you?
no.
then it is not your problem.
it isn't?
no. you know too many sick ladies.
i guess so.
how do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
i guess so.
do not worry, honey, I will protect you.
okay.
god, i adore you.
shit.
hello.
you are home.
yeah.
I am coming over.
I will call you back.
no you won't.
what do you mean?
i told you i get 'scared up here, so if you are not coming right now...  I am not kidding.
okay.

yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
whoever she is, she does not give up, does she?
no.
what are you looking for?
my keys.
i thought you said you were not going anywhere.
I am not. i mean I have got to see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
you mean that girl, do not you?
thanks a lot.
listen, baby, do not leave, really.
why not?
I will be right back, it is just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
what?
these attacks... it is got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
she is got a...
does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
yeah, i think so.
that is very serious. who is her doctor?
i do not know.
gee, that is very serious...
i know.
ruth lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
she did?
it turned out to be cancer.
wow.
so what are you doing going over there? you are not her doctor.
I have got to give her some pills. percodan, she ran out.
and listen, I will be right back and i want your ass in that bed when i get back.
you are very rude... if you do not come back --
I will be back in a while.
i do not want to see you anymore.
I will be right back, baby, really.
nothing, my sister's back from vegas.
that is too bad.
i have to see you.
hey, stop by the shop.
there were some shots.
what are you talking about?
gunshots, there were some gunshots.
where?
here in the canyon.
well, it is a big canyon.  honey, I am sorry but I have got to get back... just for a minute.
let me come, too.  please do not leave me alone.
what is going to happen?
i do not know... every once in a while i just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
well, like what?
i do not know... just... somebody is going to get me.
I have had these dumb dreams lately.
what?
they are dumb, somebody... i do not know...
who?
i just... who what?
you said somebody... who?
i do not know. i can not remember. it was just in my dream.
no shit?
nobody's going to get you. now get inside.
george, i do not --
you will do what i tell you. now get the fuck inside.
george --
keep moving --
now, george --
nobody's going to get you but me!
how are you, baby?
fine. how are you?
great, great, fantastic. fantastic. incredible. incredible, really incredible.
what?
I am going to open the shop, baby, I am going to open the shop. I am getting it together.
how?
right now -- I am at the epitome of my life. right now i feel so good I am afraid something is going to happen.
when i was a little kid, i used to want to go to europe but right now wherever i am I am going to be in europe.
honey, what happened?
i just came from a meeting... i can not talk about it now, baby. but in a few days -- see I am disgusted with my life.
i thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
i am, i am. but I have had it with chicks. they are like an occupational hazard. six guys working for me... I am going to retire or settle down or something.
what about me?
you are different.
i am?
you are great.
i am?
yeah.
do you really mean that?
hey, baby -- I am going to retire with you.
honey?
yeah, baby.
why am i great?
will we live together?
we live together now.
but in the same house, you know, one house.
-- sure.
maybe you do not even like children.
of course i like children.
you have never even been around one.
I am around you and i like you, do not i?
yeah.
okay...  night, baby.
george?
what!
not right now, i do not mean right now... but eventually...
okay, baby. okay...
jackie says she would not bring children into this world. that it is hypocritical and overpopulated.
oh yes. mrs. shumann called about you.
right.
how is she?
great.
wonderful woman.
she is.
i went to school with her husband.
great.
so you want to go in business for yourself?
right.
and you need money?
right, that is right.
you do know what money's like these days.
well, yeah... you know.
jesus, look at this. nine, nine and three quarters -- that is our prime rate. and I will tell you something else: the big boys are going for it.
they are?
after all, mr. roundy, we are paying six percent. six percent. fha's at eight and a half -- no, we will not be going back to the old days.
i guess not...
it is got nothing to do with inflation. rates, for example, rise independently of tight money if you look at interest curves carefully. historically, that is always been true, though most people do not realize it.
what sort of references do you have?
well, i do barbara rush.
pardon me?
her hair, i do barbara rush.
i mean credit references, mr. roundy.
i think you are crazy. do not look over, it is lenny silverman.
who is that?
a real swinger. he is been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
hi, leonard.
jackie, what are you doing?
going for a pony ride at kiddielands, want to come along?
i have to meet a client... who are you dating?
poster-kleiser.
oh yeah?
that is right.
I will call you.
fine.
see you later.
anyway, you are crazy.
i am? i mean why?
oh, honey, do not be totally naive.
I am not. maybe i am.
no, listen. he is a very good hairdresser.
well, he is.
so what is your point?
jill, I am just trying to be helpful.
i know, I am sorry.
i spent three years with him. i just could not take it not knowing who was going to pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. george was adorable but it drove me crackers. now at least I am comfortable. lester does what he says he will do. maybe you are happy living like a gypsy. are you?
george is great but i know what you mean.
face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you have got to find somebody. face it, time is not on your side.
i guess not.
I have got the customers... that is my point. I am the one they want. if i had my own shop, they would leave and come to me. i have a lot of customers.
look, mr. roundy, why do not you make out a financial statement? it will save us both some time. miss michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we will see where we go from there. miss michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?
egypt?
that is right.
but why egypt?
well, that is where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
you seem disappointed.
no... how long did you say?
three weeks.
look, is there somewhere else you would rather go? maybe we can change our location.
no, it is not that...
do you have children?
no.
are you married?
no.
do you have something against traveling?
no.
no!
john...
go ahead, jill, you can say it.
now I am embarrassed to tell you.
we will let you know tomorrow.
please do not misunderstand... I would really like to go.
thanks for coming by.
oh. thank you.
sure.
hi, george.
hey, baby, what is happening?
nothing, i reconciled with ron, you know, the guy i divorced last summer.
great, great. i hope you make it.
call me!
i do not have your number, stop by the shop.
okay!
you are late, george.
i gotta talk to you.
i do not want to talk about it...
but you do not know what happened.
i do not care.
i do not care about that girl, i do not care if she is dead.
calm down, baby.
I am perfectly calm, george, I am simply saying you have no respect for me, that you are incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average hollywood... mummers...
-- what?
nummers.
what?
-- numbers, and i do not need to place myself in that kind of position.
what are you here for?
-- a wash and set.
no.
no?
you need a cut.
but mr. norman said --
said what!
i just needed a wash and set, a wash and set, that is all.
well, baby, I am george and it needs to be cut.  but i do not want to place you in that position either.
-- i like myself far too much, far too much.
i do not want to place you in any position --
-- to be put in that kind of position...
I will have mary wash you. mary!
yeah!
wash her.
what with?
-- a brillo pad, i do not care, anything.
-- you takin' a lot of shit lately, george.
-- oh yeah.
but then again you ask for it -- you just like my otis -- can not keep his hands outta ladies' hair either.
-- white ladies?
-- oh my yes.
george --
I am coming, baby --  how is otis doing, anyway?
that boy always does great. he is a corporal or a squad leader or something, just wrote me from some place called kwang due?
i do not know if you do not know --
I am not used to that kind of treatment.
what kind of treatment?
I have never been treated that way, and I am not going to start now.
jesus, i do not know, baby, i been cutting too much hair lately. I am losing all my concepts...
george.
hey, baby, what is happening?
they want me to go to egypt for three weeks.
great.
jill, say hello to felicia.
hello.
yeah, baby...
how did it go at the bank?
great.
could i talk to you for a second?
hey, i'm, you know --
could i?
yeah.
i said i was not sure if i could go.
go where?
egypt!
oh, great, listen, baby, i gotta get back, okay?
okay, but how did it go at the bank?
great... can we talk later?
george!
yeah.
you are late, we are all backed up and you are supposed to go to buffums.
buffums?
yes, buffums.
I have got heads here, norman.
you promised you would do the show.
oh fuck, norman!
do not use that tone of voice with me... never mind, I will take gordon.
do you know what that lillian bercovici just did?
no, man.
-- right after i sprayed her?
what?
she touched it! then she played in it and got it all into something else. now i do not know what it is!
i can not even stand to talk to her on the phone.
she is heavy.  see, norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in norwalk. i got to have my own shop, just out of self defense.
i can see that.
you are looking great, baby.
what are you doing later?
whatever you say.
we have this political thing tonight. could you comb me out at the house?
i do not know. I am beginning to feel guilty.
what about?
all i ever do is play. i should be doing something to get my own shop open.
why do not you see lester?
your husband?
yes.
what about?
the shop. i think you are a good investment, and i do not mind telling him.
hey, listen, baby, I am a star.
george.
hey, baby, say hello to felicia.
i already said hello.
okay.
george.
yeah, baby.
when can i talk to you?
baby, I am in the middle of work.
i know but this is important. i have to make a decision.
about what?
whether or not I am going.
going where?
egypt.
honey, have they offered you the job?
no, but i think they might.
just a second, I will be right with you...
is she all right?
i do not know. just a minute...
what do you want?
your advice!
they did not offer you the job yet.
i want your feelings about it.
right now?
look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I have got to know.
look, baby, can we talk about it later?
when?
when i get off work.
when is that?
I will call you.
when is that, george?
I will call you.
but i never know when you are working and when you are not working!
neither do i, baby.
what?
nothing, I will call you, okay?
... okay...
-- anyway.
i hope she is all right.
she is fine. you really think I would be a good investment?
i would not say so if i didn't.
no, i know.
and i certainly would not tell lester.
i know.
i mean it or i would not say it.
that is great. you look great, baby, great. dennis, look at felicia's hair.
felicia says you are a very good hairdresser.
well, yeah.
she says you are a fabulous hairdresser.
thank you.
i did not say it, she did. how did you happen to get in that line of work?
oh, well, i went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you are a hairdresser.
i see.
it is an unusual trade.
yes it is.
but the important thing is you are successful at it.
in a way. but...
but what?
I am better than the guy i work for.
well, george, i invest for a lot of people. i make a lot of money for them. more than they could do for themselves.
after a while that hurts... does not it?
it is good you want to do something, george.
thank you.
but personal services are not the kind of thing i usually get into.
they are not?
no, they are a pain in the ass, there is no way of keeping track of anything. it is a cash business and you have got to watch your operators or they will steal you blind, am i right or am i right?
you are right.
who needs that kind of aggravation? who needs that kind of aggravation at my age? when i finish work i want to...
the man from sloan's is coming. i called you about it.
how did you lose that key? oh, george, this is uh miss -- this is jackie.
oh, hi, i mean hello, we have met.
is that right?
well, yes, george is a wonderful hairdresser.
is that right?
so how is norman?
great. who is been doing your hair?
i go to the blue'n gold barber shop in westwood. the guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
george is going to open a shop.
no kidding? your own shop?
george, could you -- excuse us for a minute?
sure.
i called to tell you i was sending one over but the line was busy, you are always on the phone.
i am?
who were you talking to?
who do you think i was talking to?
my secretary saw you with that boy.
steve?
whatever his name is, that actor.
steve slutes, and he is not a boy.  steve could not get arrested as an actor. he could not get arrested as a boy.
then you were talking to him.
i ran into him at the 76 station on little santa monica, what was i supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? yes, i was talking to him.
I am always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, i can not even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. you are driving me up the wall, lester. you are even jealous of the dogs. i mean I have got to have somebody i can talk to.
I am not jealous of the dogs.
now listen, jackie, I am not jealous of anybody, i just can not afford to get caught... off base.
so i can not talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I am going to tell him I am screwing lester karpf!
of course not.
that is not very logical, lester.
it is very logical, it is the most logical thing in the world. you would not feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
really? how about starting with tonight?
you and your touchy investors.
look... you do well for people, they do not ask you to stop. nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even uncle sam. they all want their share.
you are lying about one thing, lester.
what is that?
you are still jealous.
felicia's really interested in the shop, is not she?
oh yeah.
well, george, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but i invest for myself and a lot of particular people.
oh yeah? i mean i know.
so I am going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject.
when?
when?
tonight?
yeah, little election party I am giving at the bistro. it is a pain in the ass but -- i have to do it. we will have a little time to talk there.
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up jackie here.
okay.
i wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
oh yeah?
-- anything, i do not care what it is, just so it is something.
i know what you mean.
maybe he ought to go to beauty school. anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
fine.
jesus...
-- yeah... your car down here?
-- listen, I am supposed to take jill to el cholo tonight. she is really going to be pissed if i don't.
-- maybe she will come with us. if i tell her how important it is to me, i do not think she will mind. do you?
i do not know. probably not.
jill's really great, is not she?
great... so how is everything with you?
how long you had this?
oh, about six weeks now... lester -- well, he is very sweet.
I am sure.
he is a very private person, actually.
yeah -- he does not happen to know that we went together, does he?
-- well no. it never came up.
you going to tell him?
-- what for? honey, I will see you later.
jill, you are a real sweetie pie. you really are.  you are sure you do not mind?
do not be silly.
you are really a love -- you sure?
-- no. no really.
well, what is it, honey?
nothing.
it must be something.
well, it is george.
i thought you said things were great with george.
well they are. but we have problems. you say things are great with lester. is he going to marry you?
we do not think marriage is important.
but you have problems?
-- yeah, honey...
i do not know. one minute he is up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he is getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he will not even talk to me. it is driving me crazy.
five times a day?
-- i guess it is all got to do with this shop.
really, jill, are not you exaggerating just a little? five times a day?
well, you know what i mean.
after four years? no i don't... and i do not know too many girls who do.
I am exaggerating.
how much?
jackie --
what?
well... it is not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
he does?
well yes -- you know that about george.
it is been so long i do not how long?
quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that is quite a while, is not it?
i would say so, yes.
honey?
what?
i think you are going to hit that car in front of us.
-- see, i just know that if i go to egypt, well, things happen, i just do not know what will happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
-- when you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? just continually, without stopping?
-- well -- not going in and out, i do not mean just that. why are you asking me? you went with george longer than i have.
-- i guess i just blocked it out, that is all.
c'mon.
well, there was this one time --
-- yesss?
-- i was in the kitchen doing the dishes and george was out in long beach doing a show...
-- uhh-huhh...
-- well it was very hot so I would left the door open and the water was running so i did not hear him come down the stairs...
... mmm-hmmm.
-- he came up behind me and i was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
did not you have any panties on?
-- he reached up and tore them.
what did you do?
well... i just kept wiping that dish. maybe it does not sound very sexy but it was.
no, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
no, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- god, it was hot. the wood on the sundeck, everything.
do you think george is a fairy?
who?
that kid... the hairdresser.
well, i do not know for sure... he is a hairdresser.
maybe he is just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
maybe... why do you ask?
I am thinking of investing with him. he worries me.
why?
maybe he is too flighty and irresponsible. that is why i asked if he was a fairy.
i do not know. he is a hairdresser.
you suggested it, do not you think it is a good idea?
yes, but... i thought...
what?
that you were just indulging me.
no, doll, i listen to you. and if a deal loses money that is not so bad either if it is handled right.
you are in a good mood today, george.
yeah, baby. things are great. listen, there is devra, whatta you want?
chicken salad.
chicken salad, devra!
anyway, you remember harold?
yeah, baby, how is it going?
do not you think there is too much gold?
it is great.  you wanna speak to mary? hold on...
i do not know, i think...
look, would you argue with your doctor?
no.
hey, what is happening?  mary! telephone.  what is the matter?
wanda...
oh yeah?
you were supposed to handle that bitch, she is always asking for you, and she was furious you were not here.
yeah?...
she is murdered her hair... you do something with her, I am never going to touch her again.
I am busy, man.
if i have to touch her again, I will throw up!
do not talk like a child. you are a pro, now get out there and cut!
i thought you were in a good mood.
i am... except I have got to do somebody at their house.
do not you like her?
no, it is a very groovy girl.
then what is the problem?
she is a very groovy girl. that is the problem.
what are you talking about, george?
well, it is a small town. sooner or later things catch up with you... do not they?
shut up, it is all right.  do you want a drink?
no, thanks.
well, i do.
where do you want to do this?
probably the bathroom.
can not you do it out here?
well, what do you think?
I would cut it...
you would?
yeah, i think so...
you do not seem very sure.
no, I am sure.
okay... but i want you to know one thing.  I have got to look great tonight, i mean i have to look great, okay?
okay.
jill's coming with us.
great.
she is incredible...  she loves you, george.
yeah... i mean great.
... i do not get it done often.
whew.
what is wrong?
it is hot in here.
it is the sauna, i keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
yeah... wow.
not too much, do not cut too much.
jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
the shrink? many times.
bernstein... seemed to think i hated men.
do you? you still see him?
no.
why not?
why not?
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
and?
and what?
did you?
it was after you, baby. after you.
boy, that sauna is really... can not you turn it down or something?
no... lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. at least he should give me a ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
did lester know about him?
there was nothing to know. anyway... if i can not have love i have to at least have money. i have to have some pride i can do something.
george...
i just have to do one little thing.
if you screw me up for tonight, I will kill you, i swear to god, I will kill you.
i will not screw you up.
george... how about felicia?
what?
did you?
did i what?
you know what I am talking about.
hey, i do not tell.
can i count on that? i just want to see lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
yeah?
well, did you or did not you?
now, baby... if i told you about her... then you could not count on me not telling anymore... could you?
you did, did not you?
baby...
you did, i know you did.
one of my few virtues is discretion.
you just can not stand to miss one of them, can you?
george...
yeah, baby...
you are a genius.
no! don't! please!
i do not want to... i swear...
it will ruin everything.
i know... you do not know, i know.
don't, don't, don't...
sit down.
what are you talking about?
sit down!
shut the door, shut the door!
oh, I am sorry.
look, either come in or stay out!
shut the door, lester. what do you think this is, a picnic?
sorry, honey, i...
that is okay, that is okay, just shut the door.
... she is very upset...
what about, tonight?
that, and... I will be done in a minute.
you look like you have had quite a work-out.
it is nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
i know it, i know it.
... this doing hair it's...
i know it, son. but tonight's going to be even tougher.
george, i know you have to deal with felicia and you are caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, i appreciate the way you have handled the situation.
oh, hey...
it is a difficult situation, and i want you to know i appreciate it. tonight's going to be real tough for me --
i do not know what to...
son, we will do business, i can tell you that.
I would like a drink.
just a second, I have got to clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
you ought to get rid of those dogs.
they get hair all over the place.
they are yorkies and they do not shed.
here.
are not you going to have one?
no.
why not?
because i do not want one.
you here to see my mother?
yeah.
she is out, but you are supposed to wait.
hungry?
a little.
this is the one thing i like about this house... want some lox?
no thanks.
you are my mother's hairdresser?
i do her hair, yeah.
chopped liver?
no thanks.
are you gay?... baked apple?... they are cold but they are good.
no thanks.
did you hear me?
yeah.
well, are you? are you queer?
... yeah.
c'mon, are you or are not you?
gee, this is great.
c'mon, tell me. do not be afraid.
why do you wanna know so bad?
see if you have been making it with my mother.
what would my being a faggot have to do with that?
nothing, i guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
have you ever made it with a girl?
i asked you first.
yeah... I have made it with a girl...
well, are you?
am i what?
making it with my mother?
I would like to do your hair sometime.
why?
... just, you could look very heavy...
do not make conversation with me.
what?
you do not have to make conversation with me, I am not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that is sort of faggoty is not it?
yeah, it is.
i never get my hair done.
no kidding.
in fact, i do not think I have ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
no shit.
you think that is funny, do not you?
yeah.
you live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
yeah...
beverly hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that is funny too?
no.
then what do you think?
that you are just like your mother.
i am not like my mother!
you are.
i am not!
you are.
i am not!
look...  do you wanna fuck me?
yeah.
right now?
yeah.
why do not you ask for another one?
are you kidding? his hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. see, you have reduced me to eating weeds.
... my friend does not like it here either.
all right, forget this filth. continue about your friend.
well he is not exactly a friend.
is he an enemy?
of course not... he is sort of a boyfriend.
-- sort of a boyfriend?
sort of.
i see. you mean he just sort of fucks you.
johnny!
my god, did i say that? i do not believe it.
I am terribly sorry.
-- never mind.
what does he do? is he an actor?
-- no.
good for you.
he is a hairdresser.
-- oh, sure. a hairdresser. how... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
getting your hair done...  would you like to go to a party?
not with your hairdresser.
hi.
hello, george.
comb my hair out later, honey.
no, that is okay, I will do it now.
no, baby... I am glad you are coming tonight.
but are not you...
right now, i just do not care.
jill says nothing.
where is your car?
a friend dropped me off.
who?
never mind. where have you been?
a business meeting, i told you that.
what business meeting?
look at the way i live.
I have been trying to reach you all afternoon. you were not in the shop. what is this thing tonight?
what do you mean, what is it? it is some political bullshit.
i have to have jackie ask me? do not you think you could call me and let me know? look at my hair.
wait a minute, god-damn-it. do you think i want to go to some god damned party? I am trying to get that god damned shop open. I am trying to get a little bread together. that is all I am doing.
i know, honey.
maybe i should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I would never clean it up.
oh, honey. if we had one place, we could have a nicer place and i could take care of it. we are almost never here.
-- you will be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
-- what guy?
-- this guy with jill.
he is a director.
what does he direct besides traffic?
ha, ha.
television or movies?
commercials.
jesus christ, there is norma stern. look at her hair.
what about it?
looks like somebody took a dump in it, that is the worst color job I have --
we are upstairs, george. now come on. behave yourself, and for christ's sake, do me a favor. do not let me drink too much.
you do not do that anymore, do you?
george, glad you could make it, son. hi, doll.
lester, this is my friend jill and this is johnny pope.
glad to meet you, jill, mr. pope.
who are they?
jill haynes, jill haynes, I have told you about jill a hundred times, lester, you never remember anything i say.
does she know about us?
jesus, she is my best friend.
who is the guy, george's boyfriend?
i do not know. why do not you ask him?
c'mon, jackie, I am only trying -- george --
-- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on jackie, she is a little high strung tonight --
-- yeah?
see she does not drink too much.
why did not you come alone? lester invited you. did you have to bring her?
well she...
she what?
she is a friend of jill's.
and who is jill?
this other couple that we are here with, do you know them very well?
well... sure...
then maybe you can tell me why george would be going into the ladies room.
george? was he alone?
i do not think so.
well did he go in there with jackie?
that bastard.
george is a hairdresser, is not he?
sweetheart, it is a bore out there... let's lock the door.
holy christ. you want to get us killed?
do not be silly. I will just tell lester we were smoking a couple of joints. see?
do not do it.
that son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I am some cigar butt he is got between his teeth --
c'mon, cunt, you are going for a walk.
he just completely ignores me. he could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
sweetheart, you are drunk.
hi, doll, what is wrong?
you know what is wrong.
jackie shawn.
yes, jackie shawn, my wi -- felicia.
well anyway...
your hair looks -- well fabulous.
that is george.
it is just -- fabulous.  think you could do anything for me?
well -- i could try. do you wash your hair every day?
is not that bad for it?
no it keeps the skin peeling. you have got to keep the follicles open. you lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that is how you lose it.
this really ought to be layered...
layered?
well yeah, otherwise it just sort, you know, lies there -- layer so it kind of fluffs out --
i think they are waiting for somebody to start dinner.
have they sat down?
everybody but us.
well, commercials. i read for a soap the other day.
a soap?
a daytime soap opera.
and?
i was too old.
what was it, somebody is daughter?
somebody is mother.
well maybe i can get you something.
that is very sweet of you, mr. roth.
sid.
sid. you must be a very important executive.
well, whatever i am, i think i can get you whatever you would like.
you do?
yes.
-- well, more than anything else --  -- I would like to suck his cock.
-- yes, senator -- just a minute, dear --
lester, do not you think that uhh --
that girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
what do you expect me to do about it?
i just thought you would like to know --
why would i like to know if there is nothing i can do about it, goddammit --
-- jackie really should not drink --
-- oh i do not know --
-- just get me out of here, baby. i can not stand it. it is killing me.
-- we can not now.
-- why not? c'mon, take me out of here, somewhere i do not have to lie to anybody and I will fuck your brains out, you little fiend, i adore you --
-- do not you want to --
jackie, can we --
who is the greatest cocksucker in the world? c'mon --
-- you are.
fuckin' a --
now, jackie --
-- she is a very compulsive girl.
-- you phony asshole --
oh, dear that is too bad.  -- get her out of here, get her out of here.
I have got to get her out of here.
-- go ahead.
-- well are not you --
-- what?  -- I will see you later...
-- okay --  -- I will see you later. your house.
-- gee...
-- what?
i do not know what gets into me.
you were great.
no, i blew it, i blew it with lester.
no you didn't.
you do not think so? i do.
you were great.
you always say that... i really care for lester, do not i?
that sounds like me.
i am you, you little bastard.
where do you want to go?
sammy's?
he still having parties?
he never stopped.
lester.
yes, sweetheart, shh.
-- i hope you like miss shawn --
-- what, who? oh she is very nice, yes -- i mean normally ---
-- cause she is going to be very, very expensive.
can not we go into this later, sweetheart?
we cannot go into this later.
that is okay too.
you make me sick. just be straight for once in your life.
-- is that right?
-- yes, we are all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.
-- is that what this is all about?
yes and you do not have to be sarcastic about it, that is a beautiful thing he is doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at saks --
lester, you are a miserable man. you are not helping anybody. you are just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, do not kid yourself. and you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which i can not possibly imagine, you will never know the difference. you are just sweating and kidding yourself - and you are kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she will keep her hands off him.
what are you talking about?
-- think what you have time to think, lester.
well -- as i see it we have got two choices. we can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party.
let's do that.
what are you looking at?
the lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, does not it?
-- yeah.
-- look, you do not have to entertain me...
am i entertaining you?
we are friends.
-- sure.
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
-- where did you go?
-- oh i thought you were --
-- what?
nothing.
no of course not.
-- we are going to be here all night.
-- why?
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
-- what is the problem, honey?
-- his car. they have it blocked.
oh that is no problem.  -- take care of this boy's problem, will you, gene?
-- listen, i wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I am kind of stranded here.
sure thing, mr. karpf. c'mon.
everything okay, son?
terrific. now all i have to do is find my car keys.
-- I will get in the back --
-- oh no, honey, I will do that...
-- there is not much room --
that is fine --
what did you say your name was, sweetheart?
jill.
jill.
-- yes, jill.
gee... that is wonderful, jill.
thank you.
-- just wonderful.
oh, johnny, mr. karpf needed a ride home and i said we would take him. do you mind?
of course not.
call me les.
where to, les?
oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
well we would love to, but we are going to another party.
well... that is wonderful -- I will stop by there for a drink.
-- very nice, very nice.
-- mmm --
-- but you never were much of a tit man --
mmmm --
-- ass and legs --
look who is talking.
me?
-- yes, you --
well of course. who loves a big fanny on a man?
not me, pal.
-- so when are you going to egypt?
you mean when are you going to egypt?
now i did not mean that, you rat.
two weeks from tomorrow.
you are going?
you are going.
you are kidding.
those arabs will not be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
johnny!  why did not you tell me before?
-- just before i ask you out? i can not do that. let's get out of here before good old les catches up with us again.
what is wrong?
-- do you want ice?
-- we are kidding ourselves.
-- we are?
-- last night i dreamt i was fifty years old and mary told me i was supposed to meet jill at the shop. it seared me shitless.
why?
i can not imagine being with jill when she is fifty years old. i can not imagine not being with you.
what is wrong?
we can not really leave that poor man here alone.
-- he will never know the difference.
-- still -- at least we should tell him we are going. c'mon.
I am telling you he will not know the difference.
-- jesus --
-- well you better go after her.
jackie shawn.
-- yeah, this is --
-- yes, george.
i guess you have not heard from her yet.
not yet.
okay... thanks...
i do not want to fight, george.
i do not want to fight either. look... uh -- i love you.
bullshit.
i do, jill.
how come you took your own car?
i did not want him meeting me here.
well that is something.
what is.
you did not plan on fucking him tonight.
you did fuck him, did not you?
I am very tired, george.
did not you, baby?
let go of me.
let go of me or I will scream, I will call the police.
oh, christ.
that was him.
yes.
you told him i was here and he wanted to know if i was beating you up.
yes.
well, did you get a job out of it at least?
I would like you to leave now.
-- and take this with you.
where did this come from?
who knows, I am sure you do not -- but if it will help any, i found it in your bed.
so who else was there besides jackie? huh?... huh?
baby, do not do this. i do love you.
obviously there were others, were not there?
obviously.
how many?
what do you wanna know for?
i just want to know, that is all.
what difference does it make?
i just want to know while we were seeing each other... i just do not want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
baby, please don't... i love you.
i do not want to be a fool!... i want to look them in the eye and say, i know!
baby, do not do this --
-- it will help me if you will tell me.
-- please, baby --
-- no, it will help me, really --
how?
I will know you have lied to me... all along. I will know you are incapable of... love... that will help me... not now, but eventually.
... well I am glad you told me.
jesus.
what? what? what? what? what?
... honest. at least you are honest with me.
does it make you happy?
i wish you would go now.
that is all you have got to say?
-- yes.
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
george...
did you?
please!... that is not like you.
yeah, i know. did you?
george, now cut this out.
did you?
stop it.
did you?
yes, yes, i did.
what did you say?
george, if you keep this up I am going to scream.
what did you say?
george...
what did you say?
i said you were a loser!
you live like a pig.
yeah.  how long have you been here?
all night.
well... who are those guys?
what do they look like?...
look, lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
yeah, I am unhappy with you about something.
well, what?
godammit, george...
now wait a minute...
sit down.
but...
i said sit down!
i wanna hear about it.
oh jesus christ.
i wanna hear about it, george.
hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you are going to do, okay?... I am too tired to lie, I am too tired to tell the truth... I am too tired for anything.
i wanna hear about it.
what can i say!
i wanna know your thinking, i wanna know how someone like you thinks. did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? maybe that is your idea of being anti establishment!
I am not anti-establishment.
that is got nothing to do with it... you are so beyond my comprehension i can not even discuss it with you.
then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you are going to do.
no, not yet, not yet. you worry about it for a while, I have been worrying all night, now you can worry.
was it me, did you have something against me?
what, do you think i planned it?
did they have something against me?
did not they tell you?
i wanna hear it from you!
... how am i going to tell you what they have against you? i mean jesus fucking christ, they are women, are not they? have you ever listened to women talk, man? have you? well i do, i do 'til it is fucking coming out of my ears. I am on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, do not you? being fucked up by some guy. that is all that is on their minds. I am sure you have done something they could get pissed off about, what is that got to do with it? all women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. they fucking hate us! do not you know that?
... yes, i follow your thinking on that.
we are always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they do not like it... that is just how it is... look, it is got nothing to do with you, man. it just happened. felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she is getting older... her daughter hates her, what is she going to do, go to pta meetings?
do you think lorna hates her? i do not think she hates her. i mean she may resent her a little...
oh, are you kidding, man? she hates her.
why, why do you think that is?
oh, fuck, lester, how should i know?
well, i do not know.
want a drink?
no thanks.
have a drink.
okay, thanks.
you do not have a clean glass in the house.
i know.
I will have to wash one out.
hell of a way to treat a business partner, that is all i can say.
who?
me!
hey, you were never going to give me the money.
i was going to give you the money. probably i was. shit, i do not know, i do not know anything anymore.
... you can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... i do not know, what is the point of having it all. look at me. i do not have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam lyndon johnson!
oh yeah...
yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe nixon will do something. what is the difference, they are all a bunch of jerks. i would not let 'em run my business, i can tell you that much. not if i had any choice in the matter.  i do not know what to do with you. i do not know, i do not know what is right or wrong anymore.
i do not either, lester, i swear to you i don't.
what about jackie?
what about her?
i mean, how did that happen?
lester, it just happened.
she is nothing but a whore.
no --
just a whore, i go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I am through with her, she is nothing but a whore.
no, man, no. you can say everybody's a whore. she is okay. i mean jackie'll fuck around but not that much. somewhere she really likes you, lester, and it is not just the bread. she is okay.
you really think so?
yes i do.
I am finished with her.
oh, by the way, i think you oughta know -- lorna thinks she is got the clap.
what?
yeah, the clap. that is what she thinks. but who knows -- i do not know.
you are late, george.
devra, try jackie shawn will you? and if you do not reach her, keep trying.
what!
somebody is going to have to wash mrs. young. mary's not here.
you do it.
look, norman, I am not the shampoo girl.
you are today.
what is wrong, mary, are you drunk? look, I have had a rough night, one of the roughest I have ever had, now I am not in the mood for any sulking bullshit, what is wrong? are you sick? are you drunk? can you work?
otis is dead.
-- otis?
-- you should not talk to me like that no matter what, george... you know better...
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- you should not do me like that...
-- please, please forgive me...
-- you know better...
-- why did you come in today?
-- left my bag, did not have no money...
-- how did you get here?
-- took a bus.
-- c'mon, I will get you home...
-- good afternoon --
-- you have got to leave.
I have got to leave?
-- yes, honey, you have got to get out of here.
why?
lester's on his way.
where are you going?
please, we will have to talk later --
look about last night --
forget about last night, it is okay, we will talk when i get back --
it is not okay, i mean we have got to talk now. where are you going?
look -- either you leave or i leave because i do not want the two of us here when lester arrives. i just do not --
-- it is malone's.
that is it, then I am leaving.
you are going to kill me.
no --
well then what are you trying to do-
i want to marry you. i want to take care of you and i want your children, and i want you to be my girl. that is all i want. that is all i want out of my life, and it is a lot.
jackie... jackie?... answer me, for god's sake, answer me.
if you knew how many times i wanted to hear you say that...
so I am saying it...
it is too late...
what is too late about it? look, we are not dead, are we? that is the only thing that is too late.
lester's left felicia. he is taking me to acapulco on the five of the clock flight. he is asked me to marry him.
so what? you do not love him, do you? answer me.
what is that supposed to mean?
i do not know... jackie?
what?
god, there is lester...
do not go, jackie...
i can not just let him stand by the door...
do not leave me...
I have got to... I have got to tell him where i am.
what for?
i do not know -- I have got to.
