i know.  i know.  but it is just so ... neat, is not it?  the first gig that is not cute kids or diet gurus and it is taken away from me.
yeah, well like you said - it is a mystery.  but that is all it is. mystery.  not malice.  what, you think the station paid off every accident victim in the city to ... ?
better hurry, doc.  a real story.  with a real reporter.
joey ....  look, you wanna ride?  i can go by your place.
you would lose the money-shots.  no.  I will catch a bus.  or a cab.  do not worry about it.  go.
ok.  be careful.  and lighten up.  story of your life could be right round the corner.
that is the story of my life.
it was off the statue.  in the club.
what happened to him?
hold on.  hold on, please.  i need talk to you.
it is nothing to do with me.  i was not even with him.
look, lady!  i told you!  it is not my problem!  i was just there!
where?
under the underground.  can i like go now?!
under the underground?  what is that? where is ...
what do you mean?
i mean hardly any thigh.  I am telling you, joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg-cross ... and you are made.
what, you think I am kidding?  i guarantee it.  an inch more flank.  boys upstairs get hot.  bingo, you are an anchor-woman.
jesus christ ...
c'mon, joey.  I am just trying to help you hit a home run here.
yeah?  well, you just struck out.  it may be a surprise to you, brad, but i want to do it the right way.  not tight skirts.  tight stories.
right.  like last night's doozie.
i know what i saw.
and i believe what you say.  but this is tv.  no pictures, no story.
not on station time.
no.  not on station time.  my story.  my time.
uh-huh?
uh ... hi!  is this ... er ... joanne summerskill?
joey.  yeah, who is this?
you like ... left me a card?  at the club?
right.  right!
right ... so ... well, what do you want?
i want to talk to you.  we met ... now, listen, do not hang up, ok? ... we met at the hospital last night.
oh yeah.  yeah.  well ... look, I will make a deal with you ... my boyfriend threw me out, right?  I will trade you. you give me couch-space.  I will give you talk.  ok?
yeah.  sure.  you mean ... tonight?
of course tonight.  is that a problem? like, if you have got a guy there or something ...
no.  no.  it is fine.  come now.  i was having bad dreams anyway.
i put some decaf on.  er ... make yourself comfortable.
right.
what?
your dream.  you said you were having a bad dream.
oh yeah ...
... well, I have been having it for years. it is not a nightmare or anything.  it is ... well, i know what it is.
what is it?
why are you so interested?
sorry.
no.  no, it is ok.  i ... it is my father.
oh, right.  did he used to ... ?
god, no!  nothing like that.  no, he died before i was born.  he died in vietnam.  i never knew him.  never met him.  we do not even know the details.  i dream of battlefields.  of searching. of trying to find out.
that is great.
what?
no ... i mean, it is not like great about your dad or anything.  it is just i do not dream.  never have.  ... maybe it would help if i slept sometime ... just kidding ... no, so it is always neat for me to hear about dreams.  I am jealous.  it is like everybody has another world except me. you know what i mean?
i know what you are saying but ... never? you have never had a dream?  no, you know, you do.  you must.  what you mean is you do not remember them.
great.  thanks.  you gonna have one?
I am trying to quit.
oh, go on.  have one.  fuck it.  you think you are going to live forever?
sorry.  it was my father's.  it is temperamental.
it is okay.  it is just someone burned me once.
oh.  you wanna talk about that stuff.
yes i do.  terri, something awful happened to that boy.  i have to find out what it was.
but i do not know anything!  really.  i just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street.  he ...
did you know him?
no.  I would seen him in there a few times before.  he was just a punk.  I would never like danced with him or anything. anyway, he was a thief.  he must have taken it from the statue.
taken what?
the thing!  he was lying there in the street, moaning.  but he pointed at it ... 22
wait a minute.  he was already ... wounded ... when you found him?
yeah!  that is what I am saying!  and it was lying next to him.  and he pointed at it before he passed out and ...
wait.  wait.  the chains.  where did the chains come from?
that is what I am trying to tell you! ...
i figured I would make breakfast.
right ... that is ... er ... that is nice of you, terri.  can i ask?  is it always this ... exploratory?
ha!  i do not know yet.  first time. kitchen virgin, that is me.
I will boil some water.
I will do it!
no!  no, that is ok.  i like to.  i love boiling water.  it is a specialty of mine.  why do not you go watch cartoons?
this is great.  and it is yours?  you like own it?
the bank owns it.  but I am working on it.
jeez, I have never owned anything.  i have not even had a room of my own since i was fifteen years old.
how have you ... ?
guys.  sometimes friends.  mostly guys.
wow.  lotta books.  you read all these?
no.  i buy them to impress people.  of course I have read them.
cool.  i read a book once.  it was like all these people discovering who they used to be.  you know, like reincarnation?  it was really good.  you ever read that?
i do not think so.  but it is a fascinating subject.  did you ...
... but it is good.  you know, over to the left, you can ...
who is that?
i do not know his name ...  i saw the whole story.  a wounded bird was on his roof.  i could hear its cries from here. he went straight to it.  i couldn't've. I would be frozen between pity and fear. but he wasn't.  its pain spoke directly to him.  he picked it up.  nursed it. fed it.  and it got better.  everyday he would watch the pigeon.  everyday the pigeon would watch him. i saw him learn. learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. and one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away.  did not look back.  but he heard the sound of its wings.
and he still sits there?
every day.
maybe he thinks it will come back.
no.  he knows it won't.  it was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him does not yet.
but i do not know what is going on.
maybe not.  but you know more than i do. you know something about this box. something about a statue?
yeah.  i found it.  i knew held like it and i figured ...
woah.  wait a minute.  who?  the kid?
no.  jp.  my last boyfriend?  he like owns the club.  you know?  you were there?  he bought the statue.
that you found.  what do you mean you found it?
i was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  a guy i know.  anyway, there was this store.  like real old?  lotsa weird shit in there.  i saw this statue. pillar.  thing.  i knew he would love it. you have seen the club.
would you know this store again?
sure.  why?
it is saturday morning.  let's go shopping.
jesus.  are you sure this is the street?
yeah.  happening, is not it?
what on earth were you doing down here?
terri?
buying some drugs, alright?
oh, terri ...
for somebody else, alright?  not for me. i do not do that shit anymore.
then you should not even be around it. you know, it is ...
here!  here!  pull over!
no.  sorry.  not interested.  not for my customers.  have you tried ...
no.  no, you do not understand.  we are not selling it.  it came from here.  we want ...
everything sold as is.  no guarantees. no returns.
no.  we want ...
i took back everything bought on a whim, I would have no business.  i ...
never mind.  I am glad it is gone.  made the store feel strange.  who would make such a thing?
fine.  fine.  but can you tell us anything about it?
it was part of a job-lot.  some loony- bin they shut down.  unclaimed stuff.
what else came with it?  anything still here?
sure.  just papers, photos.  stuff nobody'd ever want.
can we see?
you gonna buy?
i do not know.  maybe.
right at the back there.  middle shelves.  coupla folders.  nice stuff. I would do you a good price.
what am i looking for?
god knows.  anything.  contacts.  clues.
joey ... ?
help me pick 'em up, terri.  i think the lady just made a sale.
welcome. 38
you are jp monroe, right?
uh-huh.
and this is your club.  great club.  i really love it here.  great club.
thank you.
thank you for the drink.  and the rose. wow.  that is ... really nice.
it is yours.  you won it.  it is a prize.
a prize?  for what?
you see, everyday i have my friend john here bring ...
the barman?  i thought he was called rick?
he is a barman.  whatever.  do you mind if i continue?
I am sorry.
everyday i have my friend rick here bring a newly-cut red rose in with him and keep it behind the bar.  and i award it to a woman of exceptional beauty.
oh come on.  there are lots of girls here who look better than ...
do not do that!  do not put yourself down. if you have a quality, be proud of it...
... let it define you.  whatever it is. most of the roses die behind the bar. this is the first I have given out for nearly a month.
no.  really?
yes really.
wow.  thank you.
no.  thank you.
do you mind me talking about your stuff?
unh-unh.
it does not bother me.  I am just not interested.
oh.  like I am not an interesting person.
but you gave me a rose ...
and tomorrow I will give one to somebody else.  get dressed.  get out.
you shit.  who do you think you are?
I am jp monroe, you stupid little bitch. now get the fuck out of my life.
you ... i can not fucking believe you, you bastard!  you get me in here ...
right.  like you were hog-tied or something.
what ... what ... ?
what did you see?  the same as i. appetite sated.  desire indulged.  you saw the working of the world in miniature.
that had nothing to do with the world. not this one, anyway.
on the contrary.  it has everything to do with the world.  and our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  you enjoyed the girl?
yes.
good.  so did i.  and that is all ...
no!  no.  it is not the same ... i ... no.  what you did ... it was ... evil.
i understand.  their fortune was so tempting, their affection so conditional.  what else could you do?
fuck you!
do not flee from yourself.  if you have a quality, let it define you.  cultivate it.  it is you.  by helping me, you will help yourse...
what!?  what are you talking about?  why should i help you?
because you want to.  you have always wanted to.  look at your pictures.  look at your sculptures.  look at those tawdry representations and then ... imagine.  imagine a world of the body as canvas.  the body as clay.  your will and mine as the brush and the knife. oh, i have such sights to show you.
a dark star rising.  i was bound to another's system by a soul i once possessed.  a friend relieved me of that inconvenience.  now I am free.  born again of blood and desire.
hey, that is what makes the world go round.
you see, we are not so dissimilar.
but how in god's name ...
god?  my god was diamond and black light.  and i was his dark pope.  all that is changed.  a terrible beauty is born.  with a place at my right hand for a man of your tastes.
how do we start?
it has already begun.
joey?
not quite.
jp?
live and in the flesh.  how're you doing, babe?
what do you want?
yeah right.  how did you get this number?
will you relax?  your little girlfriend left a card, remember?
oh.  yeah.  yeah.  well ... I am fine. things are great here.  joey's going to get me a job at the tv station.  I am meeting lotsa new people.  it is really great.
really?
yeah really.  I am ...
no.  i mean, really?  because I am concerned for you, sweetheart.  i care about you.  i guess i miss you.  I am sorry we split up.  I am sorry i ...
you are apologizing?
hey, it has been known.  c'mon terri, I am not that bad a guy.  i have regrets. I would like to put things right.  do not tell me you have not thought about me. huh?
well ... of course i have.  I have thought.  I have ... oh, jp, you were so horrible.  you really hurt me ...
i know.  i know.  it is bad.  I am a bad person.  but i try not to be, terri.  i really do.  and i really miss you.
i miss you too.
that is so good to hear, sweetheart.  it really is. you know, i .. are you alone?
yes. 53
good ... good ... look, why do not you come over?  you know, nothing heavy, little drink maybe, little talk.  just see how we both feel?
oh, i do not ...
c'mon.  it will be great.
not quite.  this was not here.
no.  but, as you can see, I am having some work done on it.  you found a real treasure for me, terri.  i hope i can show you how grateful i am.
yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
yeah, a girl i know helped smarten it up.  put her heart and soul into it.
a girl?  anyone i should know?
not now, no.  i mean - now that you are here, it is like she does not even exist, you know what i mean?
yeah right.  look ...
terri, listen.       why do not you come here and kiss me?  i mean, it is probably ticking away in both our minds, right?  is it going to happen?  is not it going to happen?  let's get it out of the way.  see how we feel.  then we can relax.  talk.  you know.
i do not think so.  not yet.  I am not ready yet.
sure.  sure.  i understand.  it is cool. i mean, we have got all night.
that is terrible.  what a bitch.  she was obviously just using you, terri.  ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.
no.  it is not ... she would not ... it is like i must have done something wrong, you know?  freaked her out.  just fucked up something good again.
hey, you did not fuck it up with me.  you know that.  it was my fault, babe, it really was.  and you know I am sorry. and I am sorry to see you upset now.  i hate to see you in pain like this.
really?
yes!  god, yes.  i ... i just want to hug you.  to hold you.  to tell you it is alright.
wait ... wait.  you ... you have to help me.  i do not understand.  am i dreaming this?
you have to help me.  you will understand.  and no, you are not dreaming.  do you know where we are?
it is ... i do not know.  first world war, right?
correct.  the fields of france.  and many dead flowers ... oh.  forgive me. my name was spenser.  elliott spenser. captain.
well done.  brave girl.  you have probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am i right?
captain spenser.  elliott.  i ... what the hell is going on?
hell is precisely what is going on, joey.  and we have to stop it.  i because of a special obligation, you because you are the only person who can help. and because you know what is right, and just, and true.  will you walk with me a while?
the war pulled poetry out of some of us. others it affected differently.  this is me a few years later.  we are in india, by the way, and it is 1921.  i was like many survivors. lost souls with nothing left to believe in but gratification. we would seen god fail, you see.  so many dead.  for us god, too, fell at flanders.  we adjusted to the loss.  and if we mourned, we mourned in silence. thousands drank themselves to death. others went further.  i went further.  i thought i was a lost soul.  but, until this frozen moment, i did not even know what the phrase meant.
and what is ... this frozen moment?
the cusp of my life.  what i was, what i am, what i will be ... past, present, future, all bound here at this timeless moment of decision.  i was an explorer of forbidden vices and pleasures. opening the box was my final act of exploration, of discovery.
and what did you discover?
something bad.
and why are you back?  why are we here?
kirsty cotton.  yes.  but ... if your soul was freed, why are you back?
because - monster as i was - i was bound by laws.  the protocol of hell.  the box had to be opened to let me out.  the truly innocent were safe.  that is no longer true.  the shell of the beast has been fleshed.  what i was is out there, joey.  in your world.  unbound. unstoppable.
what will he do?  what does he want?
he will do what he does best.  but he will do it unfettered.  he wants to walk the earth forever, indulging his taste for all the myriad subtleties of human suffering.
what can we do?
i like you, joey.  you ask all the right questions.  there is something we can do but it will require great courage.
i do not know ...
joey, you walked through your window from one reality to another.  you are stronger than you think.
then tell me what to do.
this is his first night on earth.  he wants to close the door behind him. like all lieutenants, he covets command. there is a gateway to hell through which he can be taken back.  he has to destroy it.
so where is it?
your apartment.
wha .... ?
the box, joey.  he wants the box.
hello?
you wanted a story.  you got it.  turn on the tv now.  and then get your ass down here ...  ...
doc?  ...  doc ... hello?
