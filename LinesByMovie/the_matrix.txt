you weren't supposed to relieve me.
i know but i felt like taking a shift.
don't be ridiculous.
we're going to kill him.  do you understand that?  he's going to die just like the others.
morpheus believes he is the one.
do you?
i... it doesn't matter what i believe.
you don't, do you?
if you have something to say, i suggest you say it to morpheus.
i intend to, believe me.  someone has to.
did you hear that?
hear what?
are you sure this line is clean?
yeah, 'course i'm sure.
lieutenant?
oh shit.
lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
i'm just doing my job.  you gimme that juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
the orders were for your protection.
i sent two units.  they're bringing her down now.
no, lieutenant, your men are already dead.
i know.  they cut the hardline. this line is not a viable exit.
are they any agent?
yes.
goddamnit!
you have to focus.  there is a phone.  wells and lake.  you can make it.
all right --
go.
then the informant is real.
does that surprise you?  it was inevitable.
he'll be contacting us again.
expect it.  did you get anything from the room?
their next target.  the name is neo.
we'll need a search running.
it's already begun.
who is it?
it's choi.
you're two hours late.
i know.  it's her fault.
you got the money?
two grand.
hallelujah!  you are my savior, man! my own personal jesus christ!
if you get caught using that --
i know, i know.  this never happened.  you don't exist.
right...
something wrong, man?  you look a little whiter than usual.
i don't know... my computer...
you ever have the feeling that you're not sure if you're awake or still dreaming?
all the time.  it's called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
hello, neo.
how do you know that name?
i know a lot about you.  i've been wanting to meet you for some time.
who are you?
my name is trinity.
trinity?  the trinity?  the trinity that cracked the i.r.s. kansas city d-base?
that was a long time ago.
gee-zus.
what?
i just thought... you were a guy.
most guys do.
do you want to go somewhere and talk?
no.  it's safe here and i don't have much time.
how did you do that?
right now, all i can tell you, is that you are in danger.  i brought you here to warn you.
of what?
they're watching you, neo.
who is?
please.  just listen.  i know why you're here, neo.  i know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  you're looking for him.
it's the question that brought you here.  you know the question just as i did.  it is a hacker's question.
what is the matrix?
when i asked him, he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question.  they have to see it to believe it.
hello?
hello, neo.  do you know who this is?
morpheus...
i've been looking for you, neo.  i don't know if you're ready to see what i want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  they're coming for you, neo. and i'm not sure what they're going to do.
who's coming for me?
stand up and see for yourself.
right now?
yes.  now.
holy fucking shit!
yes.
what the fuck do they want with me?!
i'm not sure, but if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.
how?!
i can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what i say.
the cubicle across from you is empty.
but what if...?
go!  now!
good.  now there is a window.  open it.
how do you know all this?
no!  it's too far away.
there's a small ledge.  it's a short climb.  you can make it.
no way, no way, this is crazy.
there are only two ways out of this building.  one is that scaffold. the other is in their custody.  you take a chance either way.  i leave it to you.
this line is tapped so i must be brief.
the agents --
they got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  if they knew what i know, you would probably be dead.
what do you know?
you're the one, neo.  you see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but i've spent most of my life looking for you.
do you still want to meet?
... yes.
go the the adams street bridge.
what the hell is this?!
it's necessary, neo.  for our protection.
from what?
from you.
neo, please, you have to trust me.
why?
because you've been down there, neo. you already know that road.  you know exactly where it ends.
and i know that's not where you want to be.
... shit.
what is this thing?
we think you're bugged.  try to relax.
welcome, neo.  as you no doubt have guessed, i am morpheus.
it's an honor.
please.  come.  sit.
i imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
you could say that.
i can see it in your eyes.  you have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.
ironically, this is not far from the truth.  but i'm getting ahead of myself.  can you tell me, neo, why are you here?
you're morpheus, you're a legend. most hackers would die to meet you.
yes.  thank you.  but i think we both know there's more to it than that.  do you believe in fate, neo?
no.
why not?
because i don't like the idea that i'm not in control of my life.
i know exactly what you mean.
let me tell you why you are here. you have come because you know something.  what you know you can't explain but you feel it.  you've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. you don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  it is this feeling that brought you to me.  do you know what i'm talking about?
the matrix?
do you want to know what it is?
the matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. you can see it out your window or on your television.  you feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  it is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
what truth?
that you are a slave, neo.  like everyone else, you were born into bondage, kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. a prison for your mind.
the pill you took is part of a trace program.  it's designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
what does that mean?
have you ever had a dream, neo, that you were so sure was real?
this can't be...
be what?  be real?
uh-oh...
it's going into replication.
i got a fibrillation!
shit!  apoc?
we found him, trinity.  we finally found him.
what if he isn't the one, morpheus? how can you be so sure?
... am i dead?
far from it.
what are you doing?
your muscles have atrophied.  we're rebuilding them.
why do my eyes hurt?
you've never used them before.
morpheus, what's happened to me? what is this place?
more important than what is when?
when?
you believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  i can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
right now, we're inside a computer program?
wild, isn't it?
this isn't real?
what is real?  how do you define real?  if you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
we have only bits and pieces of information.  what we know for certain is that, at some point in the early twenty-first century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to a.i.
a.i.?  you mean artificial intelligence?
yes.  a singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. i must say i find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age.  i say almost funny.
no!  i don't believe it!  it's not possible!
i didn't say that it would be easy, neo.  i just said that it would be the truth.
get this thing out of me!
easy, neo.  easy.
i don't believe it!  i don't believe it!
he's going to pop!
get some rest.  you're going to need it.
for what?
your training.
morning.  did you sleep?
no.
you will tonight.  i guarantee it. i'm tank.  i'll be your operator.
you don't have...
any holes?  nope.  me and my brother dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  born free.  right here in the real world. genuine child of zion.
zion?
if this war ended tomorrow, zion is where the party would be.
it's a city?
the last human city.  the only place we got left.
where is it?
deep underground.  near the earth's core, where it's still warm.  you live long enough, you might even see it.
holy shit!
hey, mikey, he likes it!  ready for more?
hell yes!
how is he?
ten hours straight.  he's a machine.
this is incredible.  i know kung fu.
show me.
how did i beat you?
you -- you're too fast.
do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
i know what you're trying to do --
i'm trying to free your mind, neo, but all i can do is show you the door.  you're the one that has to step through.  tank, load the jump program.
he's gonna make it.
no way.  not possible.
do you know why you didn't make it?
because... i didn't think i would?
i thought it wasn't real.
your mind makes it real.
if you are killed in the matrix, you die here?
the body cannot live without the mind.
there's something about him, isn't there?
don't tell me you're a believer now?
i just keep wondering if morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the oracle?  she would know.
morpheus will take him when he's ready.
this is another matrix simulation. a training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
what -- what lesson?
do you understand, neo?
i think i do.
no you don't.  did you see the woman in the red dress?
yeah.
look again.
every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. unkillable.  but now i believe that is going to change.
how?
i've seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.  men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air.  yet as powerful as they are, their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world.  because of this, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.
what?  are you trying to tell me that i can dodge bullets?
no, neo.  i'm trying to tell you that when you're ready, you won't have to.
set down in there.
what's going on?
e.m.p.  an electromagnetic pulse.
it disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  it's the only weapon we have against the machines.
whoa!  shit, neo, you scared the bejeezus out of me.
sorry.
no, it's all right.
what are you doing?
midnight watch.
is that...?
the matrix?  yeah.
do you always look at it encoded?
have to.  the image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there's way too much information to decode the matrix.  you get used to it, though.  your brain does the translating.  i don't even see the code.  all i see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  you want a drink?
why you're here?
... yeah.
gee-zus!  what a mindfuck.  you're here to save the world.  you gotta be shitting me.  what do you say to something like that?
i'm going to let you in on a little secret here.  now don't tell him i told you this, but this ain't the first time morpheus thought he found the one.
really?
you bet your ass.  it keeps him going.  maybe it keeps all of us going.
how many were there?
five.  since i've been here.
what happened to them?
dead.  all dead.
how?
honestly.  morpheus.  he got them all amped up believing in bullshit. i watched each of them take on an agent and i watched each of them die.  little piece of advice:  you see an agent, you do what we do; run.  run your ass off.
thanks... for the drink.
any time.
see who?
the oracle.
god...
what?
i used to eat there... really good noodles.
what does that mean?
that the matrix cannot tell you who you are.
but an oracle can.
that's different.
is it?
are you worried?
should i be?
no.
did you go to her?
yes.
what did she tell you?
she told me...
so is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
yes.  she's very old.  she's been with us since the beginning.
the beginning?
of the resistance.
and she knows what?  everything?
she would say she knows enough.
how does she know?
she is a true psychic.  she sees beyond the relativity of time.  for her there is no past, present or future.  there is only what is.
and she's never wrong.
don't think of it in terms of right and wrong.  she is a guide, neo. she can help you find the path.
she helped you?
yes.
what did she tell you?
that i would find the one.
morpheus, i don't think this is a good idea.
why?
i told you i don't believe in this stuff.  no matter what she says i'm not going to believe it, so what's the point?
what do you believe in?
what do i believe it?  are you kidding me?  what do you think?  i'm still trying to deal with the fact that everything i believed was real, wasn't.  the whole world, my entire life was a lie.  i don't know anything anymore, morpheus.
that's why we're here.
why?  so i can hear some old lady tell me, what?  that i'm this guy that everybody's been waiting for? the one that's supposed to save the world?  come on.  how do i respond to that?  i can't.  it's ridiculous. i mean who am i?  i'm nobody, i'm just a guy.  what did i do, morpheus?  why me?
faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  these things are not a matter of cause and effect, neo. i do not believe things with my mind.  i believe them with my heart. in my gut.
and you still believe i'm the one?
yes i do.
yeah?  what about the other five guys?  the five before me?  what about them?
did you believe in them too?
no.  i did not.  i have never told anyone this, neo.  after i saw the oracle i thought... no, i misunderstood what she told me.  i believed that it was all about me. that i would find the one, not that he would find me.
listen to me, neo.  i know why you're afraid to go through that door.  you can't get free of thinking that i could be wrong.  you must believe me.  there is a greatness inside of you, neo.  a greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
morpheus, i don't know --
i know.  that is why it is so important for you to go.  please, neo, i'm asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
hello?
i know.  you're neo.  be right with you.
you're the oracle?
bingo.  not quite what you were expecting, right?  i got to say i love seeing you non-believers. always a pip.  almost done.  smell good, don't they?
yeah.
i'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  and don't worry about the vase.
what vase?
that vase.
shit, i'm sorry.
i said don't worry about it.  i'll get one of my kids to fix it.
how did you know...?
you're cuter than i thought.  i see why she likes you.
who?
not too bright though.
so?  what do you think?  you think you're the one?
honestly?  i don't know.
okay, now i'm supposed to say, 'hmmm, that's interesting but...' then you say --
but what?
but you already know what i'm going to tell you.
i'm not the one.
sorry, kid.  you got the gift but looks like you're waiting for something.
what?
your next life, maybe.  who knows. that's how these things go.
what's funny?
morpheus.  he almost had me convinced.
i know.  poor morpheus.  without him we are lost.  we will never find the one.
what do you mean, without him?
morpheus believes in you, neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  he believes it so blindly that he's going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
what?
you're going to have to make a final choice.  in one hand, you will have morpheus' life.  in the other hand, you will have your own.  one of you is going to die.  which one, will be up to you.
are you all right?
... right as rain.
weird.
what?
that's the third white van i've seen.
should tank i.d. it?
what did you just say?
nothing.  just had a little deja vu.
what happened?  what did you see?
a black cat went past us and then i saw another that looked just like it.
how much like it?  was it the same cat?
it might have been.  i'm not sure.
what is it?
a deju vu is usually a glitch in the matrix.  it happens when they change something.
give me your phone.
they'll be able to track it.
we have no choice.
got it.
i need the main wet-wall.
now left and that's it in front of you.
good.
no.  no!  morpheus!  don't!
trinity!  go!  get to the basement. find the catch basin!
the sewers.  of course.
hurry!
they won't make it.
go!
we can't leave him!
we have to!
the great morpheus.  we meet at last.
and you are?
smith.  i am agent smith.
you all look the same to me.
operator.
i need an exit!  fast!
cypher?
there was an accident.  a fucking car accident.  all of a sudden. boom.  jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
i got you.
just get me outta here.
nearest exit is franklin and erie. an old appliance store.
operator.
tank, it's me.
is morpheus alive?
is morpheus still alive, tank?
yes.  they're moving him.  i don't know where yet.
he's alive.
we need an exit!
you're not far from cypher.
cypher, i thought --
so did we.  i sent him to franklin and erie.
got it.
what happened?
i don't know.  it just went dead.
hello, trinity.
cypher?  where's tank?
he had an accident.
an accident?!
you are a beautiful woman.  too bad things had to work out like this.
you killed them.
what?!
oh, god.
i'm tired, trinity.  i'm tired of this war, i'm tired of fighting. i'm tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  but most of all, i'm tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
my god.  morpheus.  you gave them morpheus.
yes.  you see, the truth is, trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  but it's not here. it's in the matrix.
the matrix isn't real!
oh, i disagree, trinity.  i disagree.  i think the matrix is more real than this world.  i mean, all i do is pull a plug here.  but there, you watch a man die.
but you're out, cypher.  you can't go back.
that's what you think.  they've promised to back me, trinity. they're going to reinsert my body. i'll go back to sleep and when i wake up, i'll be fat and rich and i won't remember a goddamn thing. it's the american dream.
goddamn you, cypher!
don't hate me, trinity.  i'm just the messenger.  and right now i'm going to prove it to you.
... yes.
no!
tank, you're hurt.
i'll be all right.
dozer?
what are they doing to him?
they're hacking his mind.
how?
they inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  it's like cracking a computer.  all it takes is time.
how much time?
depends on the mind.  but eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.
when it does, morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
what do they want?
every leader of every ship is given the codes to zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the matrix.  they are used only in emergencies.  if an agent had those codes and got inside zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system.  it would be the end of everything.
they are dead.  in either case --
we have no choice but to continue as planned.  deploy the sentinels. immediately.
goddamnit!  goddamnit!
there has to be something that we can do.
there is.  we have to pull the plug.
you're going to kill him?  kill morpheus?!
trinity, we don't have any other choice.
goddamnit!  i don't believe this is happening!
neo, this has to be done!
does it?  i don't know.  this can't be just coincidence.  it can't be! can it?
what are you talking about?
the oracle.  she told me this would happen.  she told me...
that i would have to make a choice...
what choice?
what are you doing?
i'm going in after him.
you can't!
i have to.
morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  there's no way you're going back in!
morpheus did what he did because he believed that i'm something i'm not.
what?
i'm not the one, trinity.  the oracle hit me with that too.
no, you... have to be.
i'm sorry, i'm not.  i'm just another guy.  morpheus is the one that matters.
no, neo.  that's not true.  it can't be true.
why?
because...
neo, this is loco.  they've got morpheus in a military-controlled building.  even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  three of them!  i want morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.
i know that's what it looks like, but it's not.  i can't logically explain to you why it's not. morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  i understand that now. that's why i have to go.
why?
because i believe in something.
what?
i believe i can bring him back.
what are you doing?
i'm coming with you.
no, you're not.
no?  let me tell you what i believe. i believe morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  i believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since i am the ranking officer on this ship, if you don't like it then i believe that you can go to hell, because you aren't going anywhere else.
okay.  store's open.  what do you need?  besides a miracle...
guns.  lots of guns.
no one has ever done anything like this.
yeah?
you don't know.
know what?
neo, how did you do that?
do what?
you moved like they moved.  i've never seen anyone move that fast.
it wasn't fast enough.
are you all right?
i'm fine.  come on, we have to keep moving.
can you fly that thing.
not yet.
operator.
tank, i need a pilot program for a military m-109 helicopter.
morpheus, the oracle... she told me --
she told you exactly what you needed to hear.  that's all.  sooner or later, neo, you're going to realize just like i did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
tank.
goddamn!  it's good to hear your voice, sir!
we need an exit.
got one ready, sir.  subway.  state and balbo.
we're on our way --
neo!
what the hell just happened?
an agent!  you have to send me back!
i can't!
what is he doing?
he's beginning to believe.
what just happened?
i don't know.  i lost him.
how long?
five minutes.  maybe six.
tank, charge the e.m.p.
yes, sir.
you can't use that until neo is out!
i know, trinity.  don't worry.  he's going to make it.
operator.
mr. wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
which way?  which way?
duck!
it's locked.
kick it in!  kick it in!
i'm going to make the call.
do it!
they've burned through the outer shields.
hurry, neo.
how...?!
he is the one.  he is the one!
