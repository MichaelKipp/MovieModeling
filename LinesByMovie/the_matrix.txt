you were not supposed to relieve me.
i know but i felt like taking a shift.
do not be ridiculous.
we are going to kill him.  do you understand that?  he is going to die just like the others.
morpheus believes he is the one.
do you?
i... it does not matter what i believe.
you don't, do you?
if you have something to say, i suggest you say it to morpheus.
i intend to, believe me.  someone has to.
did you hear that?
hear what?
are you sure this line is clean?
yeah, 'course I am sure.
lieutenant?
oh shit.
lieutenant, you were given specific orders --
I am just doing my job.  you gimme that juris-my-dick-tion and you can cram it up your ass.
the orders were for your protection.
i sent two units.  they are bringing her down now.
no, lieutenant, your men are already dead.
i know.  they cut the hardline. this line is not a viable exit.
are they any agent?
yes.
goddamnit!
you have to focus.  there is a phone.  wells and lake.  you can make it.
all right --
go.
then the informant is real.
does that surprise you?  it was inevitable.
he will be contacting us again.
expect it.  did you get anything from the room?
their next target.  the name is neo.
we will need a search running.
it is already begun.
who is it?
it is choi.
you are two hours late.
i know.  it is her fault.
you got the money?
two grand.
hallelujah!  you are my savior, man! my own personal jesus christ!
if you get caught using that --
i know, i know.  this never happened.  you do not exist.
right...
something wrong, man?  you look a little whiter than usual.
i do not know... my computer...
you ever have the feeling that you are not sure if you are awake or still dreaming?
all the time.  it is called mescaline and it is the only way to fly.
hello, neo.
how do you know that name?
i know a lot about you.  I have been wanting to meet you for some time.
who are you?
my name is trinity.
trinity?  the trinity?  the trinity that cracked the i.r.s. kansas city d-base?
that was a long time ago.
gee-zus.
what?
i just thought... you were a guy.
most guys do.
do you want to go somewhere and talk?
no.  it is safe here and i do not have much time.
how did you do that?
right now, all i can tell you, is that you are in danger.  i brought you here to warn you.
of what?
they are watching you, neo.
who is?
please.  just listen.  i know why you are here, neo.  i know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  you are looking for him.
it is the question that brought you here.  you know the question just as i did.  it is a hacker's question.
what is the matrix?
when i asked him, he said that no one could ever be told the answer to that question.  they have to see it to believe it.
hello?
hello, neo.  do you know who this is?
morpheus...
I have been looking for you, neo.  i do not know if you are ready to see what i want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time.  they are coming for you, neo. and I am not sure what they are going to do.
who is coming for me?
stand up and see for yourself.
right now?
yes.  now.
holy fucking shit!
yes.
what the fuck do they want with me?!
I am not sure, but if you do not want to find out, you better get out of there.
how?!
i can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what i say.
the cubicle across from you is empty.
but what if...?
go!  now!
good.  now there is a window.  open it.
how do you know all this?
no!  it is too far away.
there is a small ledge.  it is a short climb.  you can make it.
no way, no way, this is crazy.
there are only two ways out of this building.  one is that scaffold. the other is in their custody.  you take a chance either way.  i leave it to you.
this line is tapped so i must be brief.
the agents --
they got to you first, but they have underestimated how important you are.  if they knew what i know, you would probably be dead.
what do you know?
you are the one, neo.  you see, you may have spent the last few years looking for me, but I have spent most of my life looking for you.
do you still want to meet?
... yes.
go the the adams street bridge.
what the hell is this?!
it is necessary, neo.  for our protection.
from what?
from you.
neo, please, you have to trust me.
why?
because you have been down there, neo. you already know that road.  you know exactly where it ends.
and i know that is not where you want to be.
... shit.
what is this thing?
we think you are bugged.  try to relax.
welcome, neo.  as you no doubt have guessed, i am morpheus.
it is an honor.
please.  come.  sit.
i imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
you could say that.
i can see it in your eyes.  you have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.
ironically, this is not far from the truth.  but I am getting ahead of myself.  can you tell me, neo, why are you here?
you are morpheus, you are a legend. most hackers would die to meet you.
yes.  thank you.  but i think we both know there is more to it than that.  do you believe in fate, neo?
no.
why not?
because i do not like the idea that I am not in control of my life.
i know exactly what you mean.
let me tell you why you are here. you have come because you know something.  what you know you can not explain but you feel it.  you have felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. you do not know what, but it is there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  it is this feeling that brought you to me.  do you know what I am talking about?
the matrix?
do you want to know what it is?
the matrix is everywhere, it is all around us, here even in this room. you can see it out your window or on your television.  you feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes.  it is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
what truth?
that you are a slave, neo.  like everyone else, you were born into bondage, kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. a prison for your mind.
the pill you took is part of a trace program.  it is designed to disrupt your input/output carrier signal so we can pinpoint your location.
what does that mean?
have you ever had a dream, neo, that you were so sure was real?
this can not be...
be what?  be real?
uh-oh...
it is going into replication.
i got a fibrillation!
shit!  apoc?
we found him, trinity.  we finally found him.
what if he is not the one, morpheus? how can you be so sure?
... am i dead?
far from it.
what are you doing?
your muscles have atrophied.  we are rebuilding them.
why do my eyes hurt?
you have never used them before.
morpheus, what is happened to me? what is this place?
more important than what is when?
when?
you believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197.  i can not say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
right now, we are inside a computer program?
wild, is not it?
this is not real?
what is real?  how do you define real?  if you are talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you are talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
we have only bits and pieces of information.  what we know for certain is that, at some point in the early twenty-first century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to a.i.
a.i.?  you mean artificial intelligence?
yes.  a singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines. i must say i find it almost funny to imagine the world slapping itself on the back, toasting the new age.  i say almost funny.
no!  i do not believe it!  it is not possible!
i did not say that it would be easy, neo.  i just said that it would be the truth.
get this thing out of me!
easy, neo.  easy.
i do not believe it!  i do not believe it!
he is going to pop!
get some rest.  you are going to need it.
for what?
your training.
morning.  did you sleep?
no.
you will tonight.  i guarantee it. I am tank.  I will be your operator.
you do not have...
any holes?  nope.  me and my brother dozer, we are 100 percent pure, old- fashioned, home-grown human.  born free.  right here in the real world. genuine child of zion.
zion?
if this war ended tomorrow, zion is where the party would be.
it is a city?
the last human city.  the only place we got left.
where is it?
deep underground.  near the earth's core, where it is still warm.  you live long enough, you might even see it.
holy shit!
hey, mikey, he likes it!  ready for more?
hell yes!
how is he?
ten hours straight.  he is a machine.
this is incredible.  i know kung fu.
show me.
how did i beat you?
you -- you are too fast.
do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
i know what you are trying to do --
I am trying to free your mind, neo, but all i can do is show you the door.  you are the one that has to step through.  tank, load the jump program.
he is going to make it.
no way.  not possible.
do you know why you did not make it?
because... i did not think i would?
i thought it was not real.
your mind makes it real.
if you are killed in the matrix, you die here?
the body cannot live without the mind.
there is something about him, is not there?
do not tell me you are a believer now?
i just keep wondering if morpheus is so sure, why does not he take him to the oracle?  she would know.
morpheus will take him when he is ready.
this is another matrix simulation. a training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
what -- what lesson?
do you understand, neo?
i think i do.
no you don't.  did you see the woman in the red dress?
yeah.
look again.
every attempt to fight them has ended in failure.  only a handful of men and women have ever crossed an agent and lived because they are everyone and they are no one. unkillable.  but now i believe that is going to change.
how?
I have seen an agent punch through a concrete wall.  men have emptied entire clips at them and hit noting but air.  yet as powerful as they are, their speed and strength are but tethers to the rules of an unreal world.  because of this, they will never be as strong or as fast as you can be.
what?  are you trying to tell me that i can dodge bullets?
no, neo.  I am trying to tell you that when you are ready, you will not have to.
set down in there.
what is going on?
e.m.p.  an electromagnetic pulse.
it disables any electrical system in the blast radius.  it is the only weapon we have against the machines.
whoa!  shit, neo, you scared the bejeezus out of me.
sorry.
no, it is all right.
what are you doing?
midnight watch.
is that...?
the matrix?  yeah.
do you always look at it encoded?
have to.  the image translators sort of work for the construct programs but there is way too much information to decode the matrix.  you get used to it, though.  your brain does the translating.  i do not even see the code.  all i see is blonde, brunette, and redhead.  you want a drink?
why you are here?
... yeah.
gee-zus!  what a mindfuck.  you are here to save the world.  you got to be shitting me.  what do you say to something like that?
I am going to let you in on a little secret here.  now do not tell him i told you this, but this am not the first time morpheus thought he found the one.
really?
you bet your ass.  it keeps him going.  maybe it keeps all of us going.
how many were there?
five.  since I have been here.
what happened to them?
dead.  all dead.
how?
honestly.  morpheus.  he got them all amped up believing in bullshit. i watched each of them take on an agent and i watched each of them die.  little piece of advice:  you see an agent, you do what we do; run.  run your ass off.
thanks... for the drink.
any time.
see who?
the oracle.
god...
what?
i used to eat there... really good noodles.
what does that mean?
that the matrix cannot tell you who you are.
but an oracle can.
that is different.
is it?
are you worried?
should i be?
no.
did you go to her?
yes.
what did she tell you?
she told me...
so is this the same oracle that made the, uh, prophecy?
yes.  she is very old.  she is been with us since the beginning.
the beginning?
of the resistance.
and she knows what?  everything?
she would say she knows enough.
how does she know?
she is a true psychic.  she sees beyond the relativity of time.  for her there is no past, present or future.  there is only what is.
and she is never wrong.
do not think of it in terms of right and wrong.  she is a guide, neo. she can help you find the path.
she helped you?
yes.
what did she tell you?
that i would find the one.
morpheus, i do not think this is a good idea.
why?
i told you i do not believe in this stuff.  no matter what she says I am not going to believe it, so what is the point?
what do you believe in?
what do i believe it?  are you kidding me?  what do you think?  I am still trying to deal with the fact that everything i believed was real, wasn't.  the whole world, my entire life was a lie.  i do not know anything anymore, morpheus.
that is why we are here.
why?  so i can hear some old lady tell me, what?  that I am this guy that everybody's been waiting for? the one that is supposed to save the world?  come on.  how do i respond to that?  i can't.  it is ridiculous. i mean who am i?  I am nobody, I am just a guy.  what did i do, morpheus?  why me?
faith is beyond the reach of whys and why nots.  these things are not a matter of cause and effect, neo. i do not believe things with my mind.  i believe them with my heart. in my gut.
and you still believe I am the one?
yes i do.
yeah?  what about the other five guys?  the five before me?  what about them?
did you believe in them too?
no.  i did not.  i have never told anyone this, neo.  after i saw the oracle i thought... no, i misunderstood what she told me.  i believed that it was all about me. that i would find the one, not that he would find me.
listen to me, neo.  i know why you are afraid to go through that door.  you can not get free of thinking that i could be wrong.  you must believe me.  there is a greatness inside of you, neo.  a greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
morpheus, i do not know --
i know.  that is why it is so important for you to go.  please, neo, I am asking you to find whatever respect you may have for me and trust me.
hello?
i know.  you are neo.  be right with you.
you are the oracle?
bingo.  not quite what you were expecting, right?  i got to say i love seeing you non-believers. always a pip.  almost done.  smell good, do not they?
yeah.
I would ask you to sit down, but you are not going to anyway.  and do not worry about the vase.
what vase?
that vase.
shit, I am sorry.
i said do not worry about it.  I will get one of my kids to fix it.
how did you know...?
you are cuter than i thought.  i see why she likes you.
who?
not too bright though.
so?  what do you think?  you think you are the one?
honestly?  i do not know.
okay, now I am supposed to say, 'hmmm, that is interesting but...' then you say --
but what?
but you already know what I am going to tell you.
I am not the one.
sorry, kid.  you got the gift but looks like you are waiting for something.
what?
your next life, maybe.  who knows. that is how these things go.
what is funny?
morpheus.  he almost had me convinced.
i know.  poor morpheus.  without him we are lost.  we will never find the one.
what do you mean, without him?
morpheus believes in you, neo and no one, not you or even me can convince him otherwise.  he believes it so blindly that he is going to sacrifice his life to save yours.
what?
you are going to have to make a final choice.  in one hand, you will have morpheus' life.  in the other hand, you will have your own.  one of you is going to die.  which one, will be up to you.
are you all right?
... right as rain.
weird.
what?
that is the third white van I have seen.
should tank i.d. it?
what did you just say?
nothing.  just had a little deja vu.
what happened?  what did you see?
a black cat went past us and then i saw another that looked just like it.
how much like it?  was it the same cat?
it might have been.  I am not sure.
what is it?
a deju vu is usually a glitch in the matrix.  it happens when they change something.
give me your phone.
they will be able to track it.
we have no choice.
got it.
i need the main wet-wall.
now left and that is it in front of you.
good.
no.  no!  morpheus!  don't!
trinity!  go!  get to the basement. find the catch basin!
the sewers.  of course.
hurry!
they will not make it.
go!
we can not leave him!
we have to!
the great morpheus.  we meet at last.
and you are?
smith.  i am agent smith.
you all look the same to me.
operator.
i need an exit!  fast!
cypher?
there was an accident.  a fucking car accident.  all of a sudden. boom.  jesus, someone is going to make a believer out of me.
i got you.
just get me outta here.
nearest exit is franklin and erie. an old appliance store.
operator.
tank, it is me.
is morpheus alive?
is morpheus still alive, tank?
yes.  they are moving him.  i do not know where yet.
he is alive.
we need an exit!
you are not far from cypher.
cypher, i thought --
so did we.  i sent him to franklin and erie.
got it.
what happened?
i do not know.  it just went dead.
hello, trinity.
cypher?  where is tank?
he had an accident.
an accident?!
you are a beautiful woman.  too bad things had to work out like this.
you killed them.
what?!
oh, god.
I am tired, trinity.  I am tired of this war, I am tired of fighting. I am tired of this ship, of being cold, of eating the same fucking goop every day.  but most of all, I am tired of this jagoff and all of his bullshit.
my god.  morpheus.  you gave them morpheus.
yes.  you see, the truth is, trinity, that we humans have a place in the future.  but it is not here. it is in the matrix.
the matrix is not real!
oh, i disagree, trinity.  i disagree.  i think the matrix is more real than this world.  i mean, all i do is pull a plug here.  but there, you watch a man die.
but you are out, cypher.  you can not go back.
that is what you think.  they have promised to back me, trinity. they are going to reinsert my body. I will go back to sleep and when i wake up, I will be fat and rich and i will not remember a goddamn thing. it is the american dream.
goddamn you, cypher!
do not hate me, trinity.  I am just the messenger.  and right now I am going to prove it to you.
... yes.
no!
tank, you are hurt.
I will be all right.
dozer?
what are they doing to him?
they are hacking his mind.
how?
they inject virus-like serums to attack the neuro-systems.  it is like cracking a computer.  all it takes is time.
how much time?
depends on the mind.  but eventually, it will crack and his alpha pattern will change from this to this.
when it does, morpheus will tell them anything they want to know.
what do they want?
every leader of every ship is given the codes to zion's mainframe computer which can be accessed only through the matrix.  they are used only in emergencies.  if an agent had those codes and got inside zion's mainframe they could disable the entire defense system.  it would be the end of everything.
they are dead.  in either case --
we have no choice but to continue as planned.  deploy the sentinels. immediately.
goddamnit!  goddamnit!
there has to be something that we can do.
there is.  we have to pull the plug.
you are going to kill him?  kill morpheus?!
trinity, we do not have any other choice.
goddamnit!  i do not believe this is happening!
neo, this has to be done!
does it?  i do not know.  this can not be just coincidence.  it can not be! can it?
what are you talking about?
the oracle.  she told me this would happen.  she told me...
that i would have to make a choice...
what choice?
what are you doing?
I am going in after him.
you can't!
i have to.
morpheus sacrificed himself so we could get you out!  there is no way you are going back in!
morpheus did what he did because he believed that I am something I am not.
what?
I am not the one, trinity.  the oracle hit me with that too.
no, you... have to be.
I am sorry, I am not.  I am just another guy.  morpheus is the one that matters.
no, neo.  that is not true.  it can not be true.
why?
because...
neo, this is loco.  they have got morpheus in a military-controlled building.  even if you somehow got inside, those are agents holding him.  three of them!  i want morpheus back, too, but what you are talking about is suicide.
i know that is what it looks like, but it is not.  i can not logically explain to you why it is not. morpheus believed something and he was ready to give his life for what he believed.  i understand that now. that is why i have to go.
why?
because i believe in something.
what?
i believe i can bring him back.
what are you doing?
I am coming with you.
no, you are not.
no?  let me tell you what i believe. i believe morpheus means more to me than he does to you.  i believe that if you are serious about saving him then you are going to need my help and since i am the ranking officer on this ship, if you do not like it then i believe that you can go to hell, because you are not going anywhere else.
okay.  store's open.  what do you need?  besides a miracle...
guns.  lots of guns.
no one has ever done anything like this.
yeah?
you do not know.
know what?
neo, how did you do that?
do what?
you moved like they moved.  I have never seen anyone move that fast.
it was not fast enough.
are you all right?
I am fine.  come on, we have to keep moving.
can you fly that thing.
not yet.
operator.
tank, i need a pilot program for a military m-109 helicopter.
morpheus, the oracle... she told me --
she told you exactly what you needed to hear.  that is all.  sooner or later, neo, you are going to realize just like i did the difference between knowing the path and walking the path.
tank.
goddamn!  it is good to hear your voice, sir!
we need an exit.
got one ready, sir.  subway.  state and balbo.
we are on our way --
neo!
what the hell just happened?
an agent!  you have to send me back!
i can't!
what is he doing?
he is beginning to believe.
what just happened?
i do not know.  i lost him.
how long?
five minutes.  maybe six.
tank, charge the e.m.p.
yes, sir.
you can not use that until neo is out!
i know, trinity.  do not worry.  he is going to make it.
operator.
mr. wizard, get me the fuck out of here!
which way?  which way?
duck!
it is locked.
kick it in!  kick it in!
I am going to make the call.
do it!
they have burned through the outer shields.
hurry, neo.
how...?!
he is the one.  he is the one!
