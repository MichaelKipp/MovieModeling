i'm going out later.
no car.
the fuck not?
you know the fuck not.
fuck.
don't swear it's impolite.
two-fifty.
two-fifty? they go up?
always two-fifty, my friend.
score! yeah!
hey, hey, seven-twenty. seven-twenty.
what?
seven-twenty.
i gave it to you.
he paid you man.
you owe me twenty cents. come on, seven-twenty. seven-twenty.
yo! your spitting rice all over us! god.
guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
needs some pizza in his diet.
i don't think i like that guy's attitude at all. hey, you know what? take off the blades. i mean it. i'm gonna break your fucking legs. take 'em off.
you're fascist, man. neofascist.
buff, sit. you know what i mean though? somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
yeah, well, he's from a third world country. he doesn't have it easy.
what? what the fuck do you know about the third world? you been there? no? no, well, i have. fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. everything stinks. it's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. no nothing. the assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
actually, the only thing i gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to greaseball-land.
yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in turkey or india or wherever the fuck he comes from.
oh yeah? oh, how'd you ship it over there, man? federal express? hm? by the time it got there it'd be way cold and coagulated. total waste. cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead bangladeshi.
yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
you should get upset. everyone should get upset. when, when hitler was greasing the jews, people were saying, "don't get me upset. your bumming me out." my duty as a human being is to be pissed off. jesus christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. nothing ever changes, man. fifty years from now we're all gonna be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of oreos, and they won't even know we were ever here. and then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they're doing on this fucking planet and they'll all be full of shit. it's all so fucking futile.
if it's all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
because i'm alienated.
your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.
oh, untrue, jeffster. i think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where i had fucked two girls.
hey, it's me. no, that's, that's the ultimate liar of liars.
and your mom.
no, i'm here. where are you?
where are you-hoo?
no, no, no, no, i don't wanna be stuck with the guy. i want the tickets.
stuck, who? what guy? huh?
shut up! aw...
hey, we're just having a conversation.
this is private property, my friend.
come on man.
hey, don't tell us about private property. this is america, my friend.
look, look, look. you gotta go now, okay? the customers complain.
we're your customers. we're not complaining.
please!
you don't need to sit next to me right now.
who were you talking to?
nobody. sooze.
stuck with what guy?
what?
you said you didn't want to get stuck with some guy. what guy?
no, uh, nobody. it's, uh, it's my birthday this week and sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
it's your birthday?
yeah.
well, shit! happy fucking birthday!
uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
uh, well, what'd she say? is pony coming?
i don't know.
want a beer?  is pony coming?
no, thanks. i don't drink. um, well, what'd she say? i mean, did she talk to him?
pony? what's a "pony"? you mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? what's that guy's name? neil moynihan?
oh, pony's band "dream girls"? been on the road opening for "midnight hore". stadiums, man.  wait, so pony's coming by here?
but, so, pony's comin' by here to the corner?
he's around and, you know, maybe he's coming by. sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. it's no big deal. me, him, and sooze are gonna...
oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, pony, the rockstar. i understand. so you, do you, want us to, leave?
no. we were just gonna go someplace or something to...
we are?
alright. she told him to meet us here. fuck.
pony's coming here to the corner?!
yeah, no, it wasn't even my idea.
jeff, jeff, if you want to be alone with pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
sooze wants to see him.
well, you know, i wanna fucking see him. i gotta know what it's like to be on mtv.
yeah, we all want to see him. so when's he coming?
yeah, when's he coming?
i don't know. later. i don't know.
yes!
god, i haven't seen you all day.
you could've come over.
i know, i know, i know.
oh! trim it!
i hate that.
sorry. let's go back to the van right now.
no. i'm not going to the van, it's so gross. come on. i'm doing my performance right now.
okay, so maybe later.
that was really great.
was it okay?
yeah!
what did you guys think?
slides go with it.
behind me. i'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
was that supposed to be me?
no.
yes.
it's called "burger manifesto, part one the dialectical expression of testosterone." isn't that a great title?
why is everything about you, jeff?
no, not, not everything. this. i am the man in your life.
man?
yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck i am.
it's a piece.
your sure as hell right about that.
i'm not doing it anywhere, jeff. it's just part of my application to the school of visual arts in new york.
ah, you know people there?
i'm just gonna go. i figure the worst i can do is starve to death.
"the worst i can do is starve to death." listen to you.
i don't want to hear it anymore.
no, no, no. y-you know what? y-your packing your bags, you're jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
mister brooks has had shows in new york, jeff. he's been reviewed in art forum. i think he knows.
oh, well, then you better listen to him.
well, fuck! might as well not do anything! let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
yes, that's right. you know what, honey? you should go to new york. you should go. go show 'em. they need your unique point of view.
at least i have a point of view, you know?
uh-huh.
i stand for something. and i'm trying to communicate something.
what are you trying to communicate? tell us.
so you can give me more shit?
no, no. it's an honest question. what are you trying to communicate?
i'm trying to communicate how i feel, jeff. you know raise consciousness. make people think for a change.
mn-hm.
"burger manifesto, part one" is gonna make people think?
yes, you asshole.
about what?
about things that are important to me.
like what?
sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
um-hm.
wait. racism? you don't know anybody who's black!
of course i do!
name one.
god, karen johnson.
one!
your completely missing the point.
hey!
i'm talking about idealism.
responsibility, progress.
yes.
no, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
no, sweetie. cynicism is bullshit.
no, no, no. i'm not being cynical, i'm being honest.
but do you stand for anything?
yes, i stand for -
what? what do you stand for?
i stand for honesty! i stand for some level of truth!
oh, yeah, right. yeah, right. fuck you.
can i talk here? let me talk.
you know, all you know is what's good for you.
can i talk?
typical male.
typical male.
typical male.
typical male.
tim, he listens to you. do you think it's a good idea? seriously?
seriously? it's a great idea.
ha! thank you! see? he did it. he left.
i did. i split, man. i expanded my horizons, you know. served my country. saw the world, you know? i've gained wisdom and now i'm back, baby, back from the road. me and jack kerouac.
i can't wait till pony gets here, you know? have a conversation with a human being?
well, if you love him so much, why didn't you go see him play?
um, because you didn't want to go.
like i'm going to pay twenty bucks to see neil moynihan in some band that i helped start.
okay. well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and i like him.
it's safe, come on.
that's it. that's it! i'm calling the police.
why we're just standing here.
look, your trespassing.
hey, call the cops! call 'em, call 'em right now, man. maybe my cousin jerry will show up. he'll definitely take your word over mine. you can tell him about the trespassing. i'll tell him about how you sell beer to minors.
look, look, i'm not joking around now, okay? come on, let's go, let's go!
you stand someplace else, man. you stand someplace else. this is our corner. you don't fucking own it!
yes i do. my family owns it. it's ours. you don't belong here.
no, you don't belong here. we were here before you.
why don't you go back to where you came from?
hey, tim.
no, see, sweetheart, you don't want to stand up for parasite 'cause i can fuckin' smell him from here. you know what? tow words, man: roll on.
make a move. greasecake. towel-head.
hey, tim, you know what? you win.
fucking drunk, huh?
you have the largest penis. can we go please?
don't let 'em fight.
the dude wants it.
this is ridiculous!
tim!
pakeesa? it's okay. come on. it's okay. come on, they're just joking around.
yeah, we're just screwing around. like mohammed said. can't take a joke, man? hey, i hope you got a permit for that, mama!
hey, your gonna regret this.
come on, jeff.
fuck her! come on, let's go.
jeff! let's go!
no, i seriously doubt that pony's gonna be in a limo.
that's the rock star thing.
no, no.
oh, i'll bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. oh, oh, pony, come on, give it to me! stud! oh!
buff, buff, buff, buff, buff.
sorry.
jesus christ.
you wanna bet he's with a girl?
no, he's not with a girl.
oh, right. oh, oh my god! pony, it's so huge!
you know what? he probably gets bored with all that shit.
oh, yeah, yeah. wait, um, how do you figure that?
i'd get bored.
i wouldn't. if i were in his shoes, every morning i'd get up singing, man. do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of coors lite. then i'd order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather victoria secret custom-made bodysuit. so i'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. except she'd have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. and then she'd take out this half-ounce of blow, we'd snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching gilligan.
that sounds so great, man. yes. yes. hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
same, more of the same. yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. with an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. then, instead of watching gilligan, we'd watch captain kirk.
that sounds so depressing.
oh, come on, man. tell me you wouldn't love it!
no, i'm not saying that i wouldn't love it.
ah!
i'm saying no, i'm saying after a while it'd wear thin.
yeah, a long while. a long, long while.
watch out for that tree.
a long, long, long, long, while.
okay, okay.
a long, long, long...
okay.
it was a racial incident.
it was just something that got out of hand. did anyone get hurt?
it got that close.
okay, but nothing happened. believe me, if i thought something really bad was going to happen, i would've done something.
oh, yeah?
yeah.
okay, what would you have done.
i would've stopped it.
how?
i don't know. i would've done something. this is kind of hypothetical, isn't it? this place is so stupid. i can't believe we're sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. with all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
jeff. jeff.
... like fucking robots. look at those kids there.
jeff. you know, i was talking to mister brooks yesterday. he has this friend in new york who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. i could swing that. six-fifty.
sooze.
what?
did it ever occur to you that i might have some feelings about you moving to new york?
what feelings?
us.
of course.
and?
come with me.
no, no, see, that's not what i'm saying. i could go to new york if i wanted to, but what's the point? so i can learn how to order a cappuccino? so i can get mugged by some crackhead? so i can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
so what do you wanna do?
nothing.
no one does nothing, jeff.
okay, well, then, i'm gonna break new ground.
new ground?
mm-hm.
taking one community college course on the history of nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
okay, look. my job is not who i am. i don't need that. why? what's your goal? status? money? getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
my goal is to make art.
so, what, why can't you do that here? what's wrong with here? why is somewhere else better?
why should i stay here, jeff? so we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about burnfield?
mm-mm.
so i can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
no, no.
so you and i can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the sizzler? what are we doing, jeff? you and me?
i don't know.
hey, great game friday. kicked holbrook's ass, huh?
missed it. can i get a fifth of old crow?
just one?
yeah.
i don't, i don't remember. what do i owe you?
uh, eleven twenty-five.
hey!
hey. do you have a cigarette?
no i quit.
hey, you said you did a video?
yup.
what's it about?
it's really not about anything.
oh. well, what's it on?
a cloud.
a cloud?
yeah. there was this cloud and i video taped it.
oh.
i was doing schrooms and i saw this cloud. it looks excellent on tape. the video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that i see. you know? plus, i'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the circle a with the camera and tape shit.
oh, that's so amazing. i wish i could see it.
you can see it. whenever you want. don't you, um, work at a hospital or something?
yeah, i'm a nurse's aide at mercy.
your a nurse?
no, i, you know, i help 'em out. i empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. that kind of thing.
any gunshot victims?
oh, some of 'em. but it's mostly just strokes and shit. i mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
sounds like a bummer.
oh, no, it's not. i mean, they're not all totally in a coma. i mean, they know when i'm helping them.
mm. hey, what are you doing now?
right now?
yeah.
i don't know. waiting, i guess. you know?
do you wanna go to the van?
now?
yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
i don't smoke dubes and i don't really hang out. but i'll go back. okay.
okay, whatever you want.
hey, pony.
hey, man. jeff. how're you doin?
good, man.
wow, man. the corner. i mean, nothing's changed.
well, shit, man, you've only been gone for a year, man, is that your limo?
yeah, yeah. yeah, the record company, they make me use it, you know. i mean, it's dumb, i know, it's just...

the prom. that's funny.
hey, i though you guys were coming to the show, man?

oh, yeah, it was a great show.  you guys missed it.
sorry.
so how's college?

no, man, i mean it. you're a good writer. i remember those things you'd write during honors english. funny shit.
mm.
he wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
i'd love to read that.

oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. that kind of thing happens all the time in l.a. it's, you know... i met johnny depp.

new york, huh?
yeah. to go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
you have to go. you always did such, uh, you know, great work. i still have some of those drawings that you'd do in study hall.

yeah, uh, that would depend, but yeah. she should.
mm.
hey, yes! hey, pony, man! great concert tonight!

hey, i'm sooze.
yeah, right, publicist.
nice to meet you sooze.  hi, i'm erica.
yeah, she, uh, works for the record company and takes care of interviews and, you know, shit like that, uh, we were actually just doin' an interview and erica said she's like to see burnfield, so...
so, do you guys want to do something, go someplace or something like that?
so, we're all old friends of pony's. we go way back to our childhood.
yeah, he's told me. burnfield. we all hear about burnfield.
mm. you know, does he tell you about how, uh, jeff, pony, started the band...?
oh, you were in the band?
yeah.
well, i helped start it, but, you know, uh...
well, not exactly.
for a while.
well, i mean, we jammed a couple of times. you know, i mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before danny signed us.
so you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? well, here we are, what do you think? pretty fucking pathetic huh? kind of like one of those documentaries on educational tv?
it's nice here. it's different.
yeah, totally.  so, uh, what do they interview you about?
well, uh, there's this benefit for rwanda we're gonna do. and, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where i get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
where do you get your ideas?
leave him alone, tim.
uh, excuse me, i'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
tim's jealous, you know? he wants to have ideas too.
yeah. yeah, i'm jealous of mtv faggots who are named after animals.
jeff!
your his publicist?
sure i am. it's fun.
mm. and your like, what else?
what do you mean? his girlfriend?
well, that's one way of putting it.
am i fucking him?
shit.
pony, what would you say our relationship is?
um, mother-daughter.
pony and i are friends.
so, then, you're, like, available?
in what way?
mm, in a horizontal and wet way!
ew! oh, buff! relax!
why don't you fucking relax? he's having verbal intercourse, sooze.
buff.
buff is funny. god.
buff is funny, okay? she likes buff, so why don't you whip shut the feminist hole.
hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? oh, i forgot, it's not big enough.
so, um, pony, where are you staying? are you staying at your mother's house?
no, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, i just stay at the four seasons. it's easier.
yeah, yeah, i stay at the four seas, it's ease.
wow, that must be pretty nice there.
yeah. yeah. yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it's a bed and hot water.
it does look good.
yeah, so what do you guys do next? i mean, what's your band do now?
oh, uh, we're gonna go in the studio and we're, we're doin' a new album.
yeah?
yeah, and i was thinking, sooze, you could do the cover.
you do not want me to do your cover.
i don't want you to do the cover, i, i need you to do the cover.
you're not serious.
i'm always serious.
oh they'd never let me do what i want.
i get final approval. it's in my contract.
would i get paid?
yeah, we'd have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
yeah?
yeah.
oh, god, that would be something i really want to do.
yeah. yeah. how's the air force, tim?
it's not the air force anymore, scuff
so where are you?
i'm here.
okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? oh, man, i feel so good. i feel good 'cause i'm hanging out with you guys, man. you know? i mean, i forgot what it was like to just hang out.
yeah.
and you know why it's so good? see, because, see, you guys are real. no, man, i mean it. you guys have a sense of humor. you live your lives, you know. it's simple, you know. the guys on the road, i mean, the band, all they talk about is scoring chicks... and danny, all danny talks about is money.
yeah, we're all above that.
see, i wrote something about all this. uh, it, it's a song about...
well, play it, man.
yeah, come on, play it.
oh, no, man. i can't.
yeah.
come on.
play it! come on!
no, no, no, no, no, it's new.
please.
i just started it.
i don't care. i'm gonna drop it. i'm gonna drop it. i'm...
don't drop the guitar, man.
whoa!
no, no, whoa!
yes! free concert!
alright, pony!
alright, alright already.
alright!
"drove down the highway there was a big jam the family had died there inside their minivan there was a backup it went on for miles but as bad as it was it was gone after a while"  chorus here.  "you may think there's nothing to it and the truth is hard to see to be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be"
that was so great!
it's coming along.
thank you.
hey, i'm glad you put truth in your song, man. that's important.
hey, thanks, man.
so who are you?
what do you mean?
well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
i don't know. uh, i'm an artist, i guess. you know, there's life and then there's the people watching the life, commenting on it.
yeah, well, that's what i do too.
what?
comment, say things, think. whatever. why are you so special?
well, i, i didn't say i was special, but it's one thing, you know, and it's another thing to actually communicate it to people. you know what i mean? if a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
of course it does.
you know, that is my worst fear. making a sound and no one hears it.
mine too.
w-wait a minute, wait a minute.
you know what i'm saying?
sure. you make art and you want people to see it.
wait, what happened to the tree?
yeah, but that doesn't mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
no, i don't.
yes, you do.
no, i don't.
you do.
no, i don't.
hi.
hi.
so you, like, come from a town like this or...?
no, not really. i come from an "area". bel air.
you rich?
no, not really. middle-class.
oh, me too. middle-class.
maybe upper-middle-class.
"see what's around you listen to their lies"
so, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
thinks he is. well, he is.
he is?
yes.
he is.
he is.
and you love him a lot. he bought you a bmw for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. i mean, i know, it's time to leave the nest. parents hate your smoking. you didn't tell them about the abortion. all your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. subscribe to vaniety fair.
ooh, wow, nice. personal trainer? very nice.
"i sound like an idiot watching the parade i know there's no tomorrow only the charade i am dead deep inside my head all the lies there's no then only now i will love show me how"

jeff!
so you sold ninety thousand units. so what? does that mean you're a genius? you're a great artist? you're higher up the ladder? you got an extra gold star on your fuckin' forehead?
wow, you're cute when you're angry.

i mean, you know, at least i admit that i don't know. i know that things are fucked up beyond belief and i know that i have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? i don't have an answer. i don't have a fucking message.
okay, great. well, now he's crying. are you guys happy?
oh, shut up, tim. this isn't funny, man.
i'm sorry. i'm sorry.
no, no, no, no, no. uh, hey, man. you know i'm really sorry if i, if i said something wrong. i, i...
no, man. hey. no, you know what? hey, it's you, man. it's, you know what, you know what it is? it's this tarpit of stupidity that we're all stuck in. it's this cell. it's this void, you know.
oh, no, man, look. look, you know, it's me, okay? i come out here and i'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and i think i'm a fucking star, man, and i'm really sorry if i'm full of attitude. i, i really...
no, you know what? it's not you, man. it's not anybody. it's me. whoo! hey.
look, man, it... shit. why don't we get something to eat? i mean food?
george can drive us. there's plenty of room in the car. jeff?
no. you know what? you guys go ahead and bring back something here. yeah.
why don't you come with us, man? i mean, i want to hear about those songs you've been working on. you too, buff.
tim?
uh, i didn't write any songs. you guys go ahead. i gotta stay here and guard the parking lot.
come on.
no. no, no, no.
come on. i'm not gonna go if you don't come.
no, i just don't feel like it. that's all.
why don't you just try? please. for me. come on.
hey, come on, man! limo!
hey, wait, where's bee-bee? bee-bee! bee-bee, where'd you go? did you guys see where she went?
erica, you coming?
mm-mm.
you got everything right but the car. my dad didn't get me a bmw.
what'd he get you?
a porsche.
mm.
yeah. so, what about you?
what about me? i don't have a car.
you just seem to know all these things about me and i don't know anything about you, you know. what kind of music do you like?
military marching bands.
you think i'm rich and you hate me.
now, how the hell would you know what i think? hm? you don't know me.
i'd like to.
oh, yeah?
mm-mm.
you know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
really?
well, i mean, you have to understand i was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. i mean, well, i enlisted right out of high school. so i just wanted something different in my life.
mm.
"it's not a job, it's an adventure." right? i hated it. i had to get out. so i was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and i, uh, i had this big fucking knife and i chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later i was a free man.
you cut off your little finger?
well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
let's see.
come on, man. sh, sh, sh.
no man.  he's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. you're lucky he's here.
thanks. see man?
you know? i remember coming here with my parents.
really?
you know, i should, um, make a video of this place. you know, bring the camera in.
you make videos?
oh, yeah, all the time. that's what i do now.
you know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? but, like, you know, have it set in here. you know, like, like, like, with her and shit. you know, like, you know, like, "closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
"closed, closed, closed." but with your music.
you could do it.
i could.
yeah!
yeah.
i mean, do you have something i could show my manager? i mean, do you have a reel?
yes!
yeah!
a reel?
i mean, what is there to be happy about really? i mean, going to the gym, climbing the stairmaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. sometimes i just want something different, you know?
what was your name again?
erica.
erica. so do you think you and i are alike, erica?
deep down. way down.
it's a mistake to think that.
we could still talk, you know? it's nice to talk.
it's nice to do a lot of things.
that's what i mean.
i'm not a nice guy.
i know. it's okay.
yeah?
mm-hm. i'm a big girl. i can take care of myself. if i didn't want to be here, i'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for chinese food.
no, no, see, you, you don't understand.
hay? yeah? so teach me a lesson.
you okay, man? you okay?
i didn't want to eat this much, man.
wait, i'll get you some air.
oh, yuck! oh, gross!
you done?
go!
... idiot! open the damn door! go, go, go, come on!
hey, play that demo again, man. alright.
oh, man. wow. i was never into football, you know?
i gotta take a piss. do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
oh, yeah.
i'm sorry. i, i gotta...
oh, no, no. uh, uh, george, pull over.
fuck 'em. fucking assholes.
burnfield. no place like it.
yeah. burnfield, pizza and puke capital of the world.
i can't believe you're still here.
i'm moving.
if...
no, i'm going.
mm-hm.
soon.
yep.
what's that supposed to mean?
i don't know. i say what i mean.
oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
that's because i am.
it's okay. this kind of thing happens. it's just never happened to me. i'm sorry. it's true though. mm. so, um, what's your tcb tattoo stand for? what's that about?
taking care of business.
i'm sorry.
i hate it here. it's so ugly, it's like being dead. you got out of here, you know? i'm ready to go.
yeah, but sometimes i try to figure out why i left in the first place, you know? i think about people and i wonder what they're doing.
yeah.
i think about you. i mean, a lot.
me?
yeah, i have, i have, yeah.
yeah, you know, when you called i thought, there's a name from the past.
or the future, oh, no, no, i mean... i mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
yeah, i know what you're saying.
you do?
yeah. god, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.
i just walked all the way from westside to here. i haven't walked that far since junior high. i thought you didn't drink.
i don't anymore.
can i have some?
knock yourself out.
you know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
yeah.
did you ever hear that saying, "this too shall pass"?
sure, all the time, in group.
in group?
rehab. outpatient. i have to go once a week. it's kind of like aa.
oh, yeah, you had to go to highgate. that must've been intense.
intense.
how long were you in there?
uh, ninety days. and now i just have to go once a week. see, i'm rehabilitated.
well, you shouldn't drink. are you gonna drink?
no. oh, maybe. fuck.
i mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
yeah, it would suck big time. i'd kill myself first.
it was pretty bad, huh?
it was like hell with windows. you know, there's shit on the walls. kids my age sucking their thumbs. i mean, every day i would, i'd wake up in my cell and i'd think, my parents put me here. why? why? because i stayed out all night one time. uh, because i broke the vcr when i was drunk. because i was out of control. i thought my parents loved me.
we were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. we were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. and i got out and i just started walking.
yeah.
well, what it was... i, i don't want to admit it, but, you know, i was jealous of pony.
well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. he's got everything and you've got nothing.
yeah, but, when i was walking, i realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. he's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? he's not free. he's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
yeah, i guess.
you know? and it used to scare me so much that i didn't know what was coming in my life.
mm-hm.
you know, like, like, i would always think, uh, you know, what if i make the wrong move? but maybe there isn't any right move. you know? i mean, look at us. you know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same tv. nobody's really different, even if they think they're different. "oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?" and see, that's what makes me freak. because i can do anything i want, as long as i don't care about the result.
is that jeff?
oh, my god!
you know, my mom has this saying.
yeah?
"don't write any checks you can't cash."
really? what else does your mother say?
oh, hi. i thought you guys got lost.
hey, where did you go? we were worried about you.
uh, home, you know.
yeah, i talked to your mom. i think i woke her up. i hope i didn't get you in trouble.
you didn't get me in trouble.
hey, where's erica?
i don't know.
gee, jeff, i thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
no, no. i just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? i mean, i felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
mm. i enjoyed the ride. sorry you didn't.
but wait! sooze, i don't wanna fight. i'm so sorry.
what?
no, i mean it. no, look, when, when i got out of the car i walked all the way here.
mm-hm.
and i fig- and i figured something out.
oh, yeah?
i, yeah.
mm.
hey! on behalf of burnfield, i present to you the keys to the city.
so, how was the ride, kids?
great.
really?
it was the nicest thin i've done in a long time.
oh that's nice for you.
where's erica? you seen her?
erica? she said she was tired. she went back to the hotel.
oh, how'd she get back?
i called bucky's. i got her a cab. is there any hot mustard?
i don't know.
i'm gonna go to the car for a 'sec. i'll be right back.
they are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? fuck off!
wait, sooze, i, i have to talk to you, 'cause i, there's something i figured out.
god, you smell like whiskey.
no, no, i have to talk to you.
is that a threat?
i ate a dog when i was in thailand. tasted exactly like this sparerib.
no, wait, no, i thought about new york.
forget about new york, jeff. i don't want to talk about new york anymore.
there was this other place where they served live monkey brains. sweat to god. you walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. i didn't go in, though, 'cause i didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "don't write any checks you can't cash".
tim, what are you talking about?
ask your girlfriend.
well, i called erica's beeper. there's just no answer.
what are you? her pimp? she said she might go get a drink first.
well, i mean, she always answers her beeper.
pal, she's a big girl, you know? i'm sure she's alright.
yeah? well, what'd she say?
about what?
about where she went. i mean, what bar?
she didn't say. maybe she's at the bar at the hotel.
the bar at the hotel? she told you that? what did she say exactly?
well, dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
i think i gotta go.
see ya later.
what? oh, come on. you're not gonna suck my cock?
okay. you know what? watch your fucking language, alright? or i might have to.
whatever.
oh, come on, pony. i'm just kidding. wow, you rock stars are really sensitive, huh? you know, there's a life on the road?
don't do that, man, okay?
could you give me a ride?
oh yes! yeah, man, give her the ride, the ol' pony ride back to the hotel.
tim, go throw up somewhere.
you know, man, it's none of your business what i do, okay?
it's none of my business?
yeah.
oh, okay, it's none of my business. yeah, so, you-you're trying to fuck my best friend's girlfriend and it's none of my business?!
what the fuck are you talking about?!
nobody's fucking anybody!
no, see, neil, if you're fucking with one of my friends, then you're fucking with me.

i don't know. and i don't care that i don't know.
well, what about us?
what about us? i'm moving away your staying here.
no, maybe not though. that, that's what i'm trying to say.
maybe not? you think that i'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
oh, no, no, no.

i'm not suffering, you know. i don't give a shit.
good. that's good.
yeah. yeah, no, you're right. it's no big deal, you know. guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. in a few minutes they'll be back at the four seasons. you ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
no.
well, it ain't no pup tent in the garage, you know what i mean? fuck. so they'll talk and talk. they'll probably talk all night. and, oh, they'll decide that they're gonna spend the night together, right? but, you know, they're gonna keep their underwear on and they're not gonna do anything. by six a.m. he's parking the pink cadillac. fuck. there's really only one answer.

okay, come on. time to slow down.
who's going to slow me down? you, you fat pig.

hey, gary, how's the divorce comin'?
will you stand up for me?
okay.
come on. inside.
okay. we'll go for a ride.

he's drunk.
uh-huh.

oh, no, no, no. this is no big deal, you know? i can come down and, and get you out.
no, no. i'm not, i'm not talking about this. i did a bad thing, jeff.
what? what'd you do?
that chick, erica?
well, w-what happened?
well, i, you know, i took her to the van, you know. it was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? and she started crying, "tim, tim, what's the matter? i love you. don't go!" and i was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and i was filled with disgust, man. and i fuckin'... oh, man, i really...
what'd you do?
i hit her.
you hit her? oh, wait, wait a minute. why'd you hit her?
because i was fucked up, man. i just kept hittin' her till she didn't move anymore.
wait a minute, wait a minute. she's unconscious?
go look, man. go look. go see for yourself, if you got the guts.
oh fuck.
you know, this, what you're doing with your life...
i don't know.
you know, it's not you. you know? you seem like a smart guy.
yeah, well, thank you for the advice, but you wouldn't understand what is going on with me.
oh, it's very complicated, huh?
that's right.

yeah. yeah, it's okay for you. it's okay. enjoy yourself.
are you talking to me?
it's okay.
glad it's okay.
i'll tell you what. when i get my engineering degree and i'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'cause i don't speak swahili.
in two more years i'll have an engineering degree. we'll sell the store, we'll move away from burnfield and the store and you standing here.
good. see you later.
you're a drunk and an idiot.
you're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. that's okay.
yeah it's okay. you know, we have a saying back home: "either the salt is rotten or the meat."
yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause i'm moving out to l.a.
ah, that's nice. they have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
yeah. get ahold of sooze?
no, no, i wasn't trying.
she was at the four seasons last night, man. but you shouldn't worry about that.
no, i'm not, i'm not worried. i'm not worried.
no. life is too short.
no, i'm not worried.
good.
uh, buff, i'm, i'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
sure.
no, i mean, no one.
hey, you know me.
buff, look at me for a second. no, this is serious.
yeah.
uh, last night...
yeah, i should've stuck up for you, man, i know. you're my friend, she's your old lady.
no, no.
i feel really bad about that, but i was busy, you know, i mean...
no, look, this is not about sooze, alright. wait, wait, wait, wait. she stayed at the four seasons last night with pony?
yeah, we all stayed at the four seasons, man. it was party time. hey, i hung out with danny, pony's manager. really nice guy. we talked about the video. they want a raw look. something fresh. danny said if i can capture the reality of burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
okay, buff, listen to me for a second alright?
no, i know what you're going to say. i don't know anything about making a video. but that's a plus.
no.
because since i'm just starting out, i've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
buff, listen to me. could you just-
but i'd, i'd do it for free. you know, just for my reel.
buff, can you listen to me for a second?
oh, and guess who showed up.
no, shut up! look, look, alright, tim is in trouble.
i know, man.
you know?
yeah, that's what i'm trying to tell you. that chick erica?

no man, she showed up last night at the hotel. we has a great time together. i stayed in her room last night, man. what can i say?
wait a minute, wait a minute. you saw erica last night?
yeah, i saw all of erica last night, man.
buff, you got to stop making shit up. it didn't happen.
y- s-sure it did.
no. it didn't, buff.
wait. hey, man.
erica is in the van back there.

she's dead.
she's dead?
look, tim confessed to me last night.
tim...

that's bullshit. that's total utter bullshit.
oh, really? you wanna go look?
yeah, man.
let's go look, then. let's go look, then!
it's bullshit. look! look!
hey! hey.
i'm so burnt-out.
oh, how did you get burnt-out?
playing with something really hot. yeah.
yeah?
oh, my god, you found it. thank you so much.  did you get your tape?
yup. hey, um, so, um, listen, man, i got to go show the tape to danny at the hotel, and if i get the gig, erica is gonna teach me how to surf in l.a.
oh, i'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
i can come visit?
you better! yes!
i will.
it was really nice meeting you, jeff. if you're ever in l.a., you should come by the offices. i talked to pony earlier. he said he had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading some of your songs.
ow! hey! get the heck in there!  hey... not dead! definitely not dead!
guess not.
see, i wasn't making shit up, man.
no.
god, tim lied to your ass, man. that guy's sad, man. well, uh, i gotta go, but, uh, listen, if i don't come back, i'll send a video of me surfing. alright, man? get some rest. go with the flow.
alright. 'bye, buff.
hey, man.
hey.
they let you out?
yeah, of course they let me out. chickenshits. i gotta pay some class c misdemeanor ticket. so did i call it or did i call it? she spent the night, didn't she? hm? oh, that sucks for you, pal. oh, shit.
you lied to me.
you want to know what your problem is, jeff? you want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. it's true. look at you. you're gullible and you're gutless.
no, no. that's not the way it is at all. no, i stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. wait, yeah, no, i was trying to come up with some lie so that you wouldn't have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
wow. you did that for me?
yes.
well, you know, all i can say is, you're a fucking fool.
why? because i give a shit?
oh, shit.
because i care, i'm a fucking fool?
oh, jeff, give me a break. you didn't even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
oh no, no. you know what? fuck that. no, you lied to me. you lied to me because you're gutless. you're a gutless, drunken looser.
i'm a loser. and i'm drunk. but i'm not gutless.
you know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? he's just gonna call the cops again.
good, good. i, i hope he does.
the sun hasn't even come up yet and you're drinking.
hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. did you think she was gonna use it?
i don't know.
you don't know?
no.
come on. you don't think that after they called the cops on me, her and mohammed had a nice laugh?
no.
no? well, i disagree. i think they did. i think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? makes me sick.
what are, what are you doing? look, tim, just go home. alright. go home and sleep it off.
well, what am i supposed to sleep off? my life? you know, i'm supposed to go home and go to sleep and when i wake up, what'll i be, jeff? a pilot? maybe a super bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. right? i don't think so, man.
just go home, alright?
this is my home.
why, why did you start this in the first place, man? they never hurt you.
they never hurt me? they hurt me every day with their attitude. you know, like they even have a right. who the fuck do they think they are? let me tell you something, i was born here. alright? i'm an american. and i'm owed something. look, they took it from me.
they're just people. alright? they got feelings, you know?
what about my feelings? what about my fucking feelings? these assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? well, they don't know shit.
will you just put the gun down?
no.
just put it down.
jeff, stay there.
he's got a gun. he's got a gun.
well, then, there now, why don't you go inside and call the cops and i'll come in there and blow your fucking brains out.
why should i call the police, huh? they don't so any good.
well, you gotta call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
no. no, you see, i don't have to call my wife.
well, what about this?
what about this, huh? go ahead, big man.
camel jockey.
you know, why do you call me names? you know, i never hurt you. i'm only working here.
yeah, yeah. that's the fucking problem.
