I am going out later.
no car.
the fuck not?
you know the fuck not.
fuck.
do not swear it is impolite.
two-fifty.
two-fifty? they go up?
always two-fifty, my friend.
score! yeah!
hey, hey, seven-twenty. seven-twenty.
what?
seven-twenty.
i gave it to you.
he paid you man.
you owe me twenty cents. come on, seven-twenty. seven-twenty.
yo! your spitting rice all over us! god.
guy should cut down on his caffeine intake.
needs some pizza in his diet.
i do not think i like that guy's attitude at all. hey, you know what? take off the blades. i mean it. I am going to break your fucking legs. take 'em off.
you are fascist, man. neofascist.
buff, sit. you know what i mean though? somebody ought to crack that guy with a baseball bat.
yeah, well, he is from a third world country. he does not have it easy.
what? what the fuck do you know about the third world? you been there? no? no, well, i have. fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. everything stinks. it is true, there is no, you know, law, no order. no nothing. the assholes come over here, they think it is going to be the same.
hey, he is a human being you can give him that much.
actually, the only thing i gotta give that guy is a one-way ticket back to greaseball-land.
yeah, well, that pizza could feed a family of four in turkey or india or wherever the fuck he comes from.
oh yeah? oh, how did you ship it over there, man? federal express? hm? by the time it got there it would be way cold and coagulated. total waste. cheese be stuck to the cardboard.
buff, that slice is the difference between life and death for some half-dead bangladeshi.
yo, your gettin' me all upset here.
you should get upset. everyone should get upset. when, when hitler was greasing the jews, people were saying, "don't get me upset. your bumming me out." my duty as a human being is to be pissed off. jesus christ, not that it makes a difference on the first fucking place. nothing ever changes, man. fifty years from now we are all going to be dead and there'll be new people standing here drinking beer, eating pizza, bitching and moaning about the price of oreos, and they will not even know we were ever here. and then fifty years after that those suckers will be dust and bones and there'll be all these generations of suckers trying to figure out what they are doing on this fucking planet and they will all be full of shit. it is all so fucking futile.
if it is all so fucking futile, what the fuck are you so fucking upset about, fuckhead?
because I am alienated.
your ability to fantasize is only exceeded by your ability to lie.
oh, untrue, jeffster. i think, uh, two weeks ago we attended a concert where i had fucked two girls.
hey, it is me. no, that's, that is the ultimate liar of liars.
and your mom.
no, I am here. where are you?
where are you-hoo?
no, no, no, no, i do not wanna be stuck with the guy. i want the tickets.
stuck, who? what guy? huh?
shut up! aw...
hey, we are just having a conversation.
this is private property, my friend.
come on man.
hey, do not tell us about private property. this is america, my friend.
look, look, look. you gotta go now, okay? the customers complain.
we are your customers. we are not complaining.
please!
you do not need to sit next to me right now.
who were you talking to?
nobody. sooze.
stuck with what guy?
what?
you said you did not want to get stuck with some guy. what guy?
no, uh, nobody. it's, uh, it is my birthday this week and sooze's brother might come by to wish me a happy birthday.
it is your birthday?
yeah.
well, shit! happy fucking birthday!
uh, yeah, she should be coming by.
uh, well, what did she say? is pony coming?
i do not know.
want a beer?  is pony coming?
no, thanks. i do not drink. um, well, what did she say? i mean, did she talk to him?
pony? what is a "pony"? you mean that geek who played the folk music at the senior prom? what is that guy's name? neil moynihan?
oh, pony's band "dream girls"? been on the road opening for "midnight hore". stadiums, man.  wait, so pony's coming by here?
but, so, pony's comin' by here to the corner?
he is around and, you know, maybe he is coming by. sooze told him to come by and hang out, whatever. it is no big deal. me, him, and sooze are gonna...
oh, no, you wanted to get together with your close friend, pony, the rockstar. i understand. so you, do you, want us to, leave?
no. we were just gonna go someplace or something to...
we are?
alright. she told him to meet us here. fuck.
pony's coming here to the corner?!
yeah, no, it was not even my idea.
jeff, jeff, if you want to be alone with pony, you know, that's, that is fine with us.
sooze wants to see him.
well, you know, i wanna fucking see him. i got to know what it is like to be on mtv.
yeah, we all want to see him. so when is he coming?
yeah, when is he coming?
i do not know. later. i do not know.
yes!
god, i have not seen you all day.
you could have come over.
i know, i know, i know.
oh! trim it!
i hate that.
sorry. let's go back to the van right now.
no. I am not going to the van, it is so gross. come on. I am doing my performance right now.
okay, so maybe later.
that was really great.
was it okay?
yeah!
what did you guys think?
slides go with it.
behind me. I am making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
was that supposed to be me?
no.
yes.
it is called "burger manifesto, part one the dialectical expression of testosterone." is not that a great title?
why is everything about you, jeff?
no, not, not everything. this. i am the man in your life.
man?
yeah, man, male, significant other, whatever the fuck i am.
it is a piece.
your sure as hell right about that.
I am not doing it anywhere, jeff. it is just part of my application to the school of visual arts in new york.
ah, you know people there?
I am just going to go. i figure the worst i can do is starve to death.
"the worst i can do is starve to death." listen to you.
i do not want to hear it anymore.
no, no, no. y-you know what? y-your packing your bags, you are jumping into the unknown because some conceptual artist who teaches at a community college is having a mid-life crisis and he wants to sleep with some girl half his age, so he tells you you have talent.
mister brooks has had shows in new york, jeff. he is been reviewed in art forum. i think he knows.
oh, well, then you better listen to him.
well, fuck! might as well not do anything! let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
yes, that is right. you know what, honey? you should go to new york. you should go. go show 'em. they need your unique point of view.
at least i have a point of view, you know?
uh-huh.
i stand for something. and I am trying to communicate something.
what are you trying to communicate? tell us.
so you can give me more shit?
no, no. it is an honest question. what are you trying to communicate?
I am trying to communicate how i feel, jeff. you know raise consciousness. make people think for a change.
mn-hm.
"burger manifesto, part one" is gonna make people think?
yes, you asshole.
about what?
about things that are important to me.
like what?
sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
um-hm.
wait. racism? you do not know anybody who is black!
of course i do!
name one.
god, karen johnson.
one!
your completely missing the point.
hey!
I am talking about idealism.
responsibility, progress.
yes.
no, idealism is guilty, middle class bullshit.
no, sweetie. cynicism is bullshit.
no, no, no. I am not being cynical, I am being honest.
but do you stand for anything?
yes, i stand for -
what? what do you stand for?
i stand for honesty! i stand for some level of truth!
oh, yeah, right. yeah, right. fuck you.
can i talk here? let me talk.
you know, all you know is what is good for you.
can i talk?
typical male.
typical male.
typical male.
typical male.
tim, he listens to you. do you think it is a good idea? seriously?
seriously? it is a great idea.
ha! thank you! see? he did it. he left.
i did. i split, man. i expanded my horizons, you know. served my country. saw the world, you know? I have gained wisdom and now I am back, baby, back from the road. me and jack kerouac.
i can not wait till pony gets here, you know? have a conversation with a human being?
well, if you love him so much, why did not you go see him play?
um, because you did not want to go.
like I am going to pay twenty bucks to see neil moynihan in some band that i helped start.
okay. well, you know, he is always been a nice guy and i like him.
it is safe, come on.
that is it. that is it! I am calling the police.
why we are just standing here.
look, your trespassing.
hey, call the cops! call 'em, call 'em right now, man. maybe my cousin jerry will show up. he will definitely take your word over mine. you can tell him about the trespassing. I will tell him about how you sell beer to minors.
look, look, I am not joking around now, okay? come on, let's go, let's go!
you stand someplace else, man. you stand someplace else. this is our corner. you do not fucking own it!
yes i do. my family owns it. it is ours. you do not belong here.
no, you do not belong here. we were here before you.
why do not you go back to where you came from?
hey, tim.
no, see, sweetheart, you do not want to stand up for parasite 'cause i can fuckin' smell him from here. you know what? tow words, man: roll on.
make a move. greasecake. towel-head.
hey, tim, you know what? you win.
fucking drunk, huh?
you have the largest penis. can we go please?
do not let 'em fight.
the dude wants it.
this is ridiculous!
tim!
pakeesa? it is okay. come on. it is okay. come on, they are just joking around.
yeah, we are just screwing around. like mohammed said. can not take a joke, man? hey, i hope you got a permit for that, mama!
hey, your gonna regret this.
come on, jeff.
fuck her! come on, let's go.
jeff! let's go!
no, i seriously doubt that pony's going to be in a limo.
that is the rock star thing.
no, no.
oh, I will bet you he has a babe with him right out of a triple-x video. oh, oh, pony, come on, give it to me! stud! oh!
buff, buff, buff, buff, buff.
sorry.
jesus christ.
you wanna bet he is with a girl?
no, he is not with a girl.
oh, right. oh, oh my god! pony, it is so huge!
you know what? he probably gets bored with all that shit.
oh, yeah, yeah. wait, um, how do you figure that?
I would get bored.
i wouldn't. if i were in his shoes, every morning I would get up singing, man. do my work-out, take a shower, followed by a hearty breakfast, steak and eggs, washed down with a pot of hot coffee, six pack of coors lite. then I would order my bodyguard to go find my babe, who would appear decked out in her all-black leather victoria secret custom-made bodysuit. so i'd, like, have to chew off all her clothes until she was completely nude. except she would have these amazing dragon tattoos all over her body and pierced nipples with little gold peace signs hanging from 'em. and then she would take out this half-ounce of blow, we would snap out a few mondo lines, vaporize a few million brain cells, screw for about an hour, then spend the rest of the morning trashed watching gilligan.
that sounds so great, man. yes. yes. hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
same, more of the same. yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. with an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. then, instead of watching gilligan, we would watch captain kirk.
that sounds so depressing.
oh, come on, man. tell me you would not love it!
no, I am not saying that i would not love it.
ah!
I am saying no, I am saying after a while it would wear thin.
yeah, a long while. a long, long while.
watch out for that tree.
a long, long, long, long, while.
okay, okay.
a long, long, long...
okay.
it was a racial incident.
it was just something that got out of hand. did anyone get hurt?
it got that close.
okay, but nothing happened. believe me, if i thought something really bad was going to happen, i would have done something.
oh, yeah?
yeah.
okay, what would you have done.
i would have stopped it.
how?
i do not know. i would have done something. this is kind of hypothetical, is not it? this place is so stupid. i can not believe we are sitting here in this mosh-pit of consumerism. with all these people eating their chunks of dead flesh...
jeff. jeff.
... like fucking robots. look at those kids there.
jeff. you know, i was talking to mister brooks yesterday. he has this friend in new york who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. i could swing that. six-fifty.
sooze.
what?
did it ever occur to you that i might have some feelings about you moving to new york?
what feelings?
us.
of course.
and?
come with me.
no, no, see, that is not what I am saying. i could go to new york if i wanted to, but what is the point? so i can learn how to order a cappuccino? so i can get mugged by some crackhead? so i can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
so what do you wanna do?
nothing.
no one does nothing, jeff.
okay, well, then, I am going to break new ground.
new ground?
mm-hm.
taking one community college course on the history of nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
okay, look. my job is not who i am. i do not need that. why? what is your goal? status? money? getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
my goal is to make art.
so, what, why can not you do that here? what is wrong with here? why is somewhere else better?
why should i stay here, jeff? so we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about burnfield?
mm-mm.
so i can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
no, no.
so you and i can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the sizzler? what are we doing, jeff? you and me?
i do not know.
hey, great game friday. kicked holbrook's ass, huh?
missed it. can i get a fifth of old crow?
just one?
yeah.
i don't, i do not remember. what do i owe you?
uh, eleven twenty-five.
hey!
hey. do you have a cigarette?
no i quit.
hey, you said you did a video?
yup.
what is it about?
it is really not about anything.
oh. well, what is it on?
a cloud.
a cloud?
yeah. there was this cloud and i video taped it.
oh.
i was doing schrooms and i saw this cloud. it looks excellent on tape. the video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that i see. you know? plus, I am going to come down here one night and walk around inside the circle a with the camera and tape shit.
oh, that is so amazing. i wish i could see it.
you can see it. whenever you want. do not you, um, work at a hospital or something?
yeah, I am a nurse's aide at mercy.
your a nurse?
no, i, you know, i help 'em out. i empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. that kind of thing.
any gunshot victims?
oh, some of 'em. but it is mostly just strokes and shit. i mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
sounds like a bummer.
oh, no, it is not. i mean, they are not all totally in a coma. i mean, they know when I am helping them.
mm. hey, what are you doing now?
right now?
yeah.
i do not know. waiting, i guess. you know?
do you wanna go to the van?
now?
yeah, we could hang out and smoke a dube, you know?
i do not smoke dubes and i do not really hang out. but I will go back. okay.
okay, whatever you want.
hey, pony.
hey, man. jeff. how're you doin?
good, man.
wow, man. the corner. i mean, nothing's changed.
well, shit, man, you have only been gone for a year, man, is that your limo?

so, we are all old friends of pony's. we go way back to our childhood.
yeah, he is told me. burnfield. we all hear about burnfield.
mm. you know, does he tell you about how, uh, jeff, pony, started the band...?
oh, you were in the band?
yeah.
well, i helped start it, but, you know, uh...
well, not exactly.
for a while.
well, i mean, we jammed a couple of times. you know, i mean, you play harmonica, but that was before we were really a band, you know, before danny signed us.
so you came by to see how the other half lives, huh? well, here we are, what do you think? pretty fucking pathetic huh? kind of like one of those documentaries on educational tv?
it is nice here. it is different.
yeah, totally.  so, uh, what do they interview you about?
well, uh, there is this benefit for rwanda we are going to do. and, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where i get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
where do you get your ideas?
leave him alone, tim.
uh, excuse me, I would like to know where he gets his ideas.
tim's jealous, you know? he wants to have ideas too.
yeah. yeah, I am jealous of mtv faggots who are named after animals.
jeff!
your his publicist?
sure i am. it is fun.
mm. and your like, what else?
what do you mean? his girlfriend?
well, that is one way of putting it.
am i fucking him?

pony, what would you say our relationship is?
um, mother-daughter.
pony and i are friends.
so, then, you're, like, available?
in what way?
mm, in a horizontal and wet way!
ew! oh, buff! relax!
why do not you fucking relax? he is having verbal intercourse, sooze.
buff.
buff is funny. god.
buff is funny, okay? she likes buff, so why do not you whip shut the feminist hole.
hey, why do not you swallow your cock and choke on it? oh, i forgot, it is not big enough.
so, um, pony, where are you staying? are you staying at your mother's house?
no, no, they, uh, you know, that can be kind of a hassle, so , uh, you know, i just stay at the four seasons. it is easier.
yeah, yeah, i stay at the four seas, it is ease.
wow, that must be pretty nice there.
yeah. yeah. yeah, yeah, it's, you know, it is a bed and hot water.
it does look good.
yeah, so what do you guys do next? i mean, what is your band do now?
oh, uh, we are going to go in the studio and we're, we are doin' a new album.
yeah?
yeah, and i was thinking, sooze, you could do the cover.
you do not want me to do your cover.
i do not want you to do the cover, i, i need you to do the cover.
you are not serious.
I am always serious.
oh they would never let me do what i want.
i get final approval. it is in my contract.
would i get paid?
yeah, we would have to fly you out for meetings, you know.
yeah?
yeah.
oh, god, that would be something i really want to do.
yeah. yeah. how is the air force, tim?
it is not the air force anymore, scuff
so where are you?
I am here.
okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? oh, man, i feel so good. i feel good 'cause I am hanging out with you guys, man. you know? i mean, i forgot what it was like to just hang out.
yeah.
and you know why it is so good? see, because, see, you guys are real. no, man, i mean it. you guys have a sense of humor. you live your lives, you know. it is simple, you know. the guys on the road, i mean, the band, all they talk about is scoring chicks... and danny, all danny talks about is money.
yeah, we are all above that.
see, i wrote something about all this. uh, it, it is a song about...
well, play it, man.
yeah, come on, play it.
oh, no, man. i can't.
yeah.
come on.
play it! come on!
no, no, no, no, no, it is new.
please.
i just started it.
i do not care. I am going to drop it. I am going to drop it. i'm...
do not drop the guitar, man.
whoa!
no, no, whoa!
yes! free concert!
alright, pony!
alright, alright already.
alright!
"drove down the highway there was a big jam the family had died there inside their minivan there was a backup it went on for miles but as bad as it was it was gone after a while"  chorus here.  "you may think there is nothing to it and the truth is hard to see to be an invisible man is a remarkable thing to be thing to be thing to be"
that was so great!
it is coming along.
thank you.
hey, I am glad you put truth in your song, man. that is important.
hey, thanks, man.
so who are you?
what do you mean?
well, if we're, like, the man invisible, what are you?
i do not know. uh, I am an artist, i guess. you know, there is life and then there is the people watching the life, commenting on it.
yeah, well, that is what i do too.
what?
comment, say things, think. whatever. why are you so special?
well, i, i did not say i was special, but it is one thing, you know, and it is another thing to actually communicate it to people. you know what i mean? if a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does that make a sound?
of course it does.
you know, that is my worst fear. making a sound and no one hears it.
mine too.
w-wait a minute, wait a minute.
you know what I am saying?
sure. you make art and you want people to see it.
wait, what happened to the tree?
yeah, but that does not mean that your tree is not artistic if no one cuts it down.
jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
no, i don't.
yes, you do.
no, i don't.
you do.
no, i don't.
hi.
hi.
so you, like, come from a town like this or...?
no, not really. i come from an "area". bel air.
you rich?
no, not really. middle-class.
oh, me too. middle-class.
maybe upper-middle-class.
"see what is around you listen to their lies"
so, like, your dad's a big deal, right?
thinks he is. well, he is.
he is?
yes.
he is.
he is.
and you love him a lot. he bought you a bmw for your birthday, but you finally had to move out and get your own place. i mean, i know, it is time to leave the nest. parents hate your smoking. you did not tell them about the abortion. all your friends got boob jobs, you got the tattoo instead. subscribe to vaniety fair.
ooh, wow, nice. personal trainer? very nice.
"i sound like an idiot watching the parade i know there is no tomorrow only the charade i am dead deep inside my head all the lies there is no then only now i will love show me how"
fuck! pony, if we wanted to hear you sing, we would have gone to your concert!
jeff!
so you sold ninety thousand units. so what? does that mean you are a genius? you are a great artist? you are higher up the ladder? you got an extra gold star on your fuckin' forehead?
wow, you are cute when you are angry.

no, man. hey. no, you know what? hey, it is you, man. it's, you know what, you know what it is? it is this tarpit of stupidity that we are all stuck in. it is this cell. it is this void, you know.
oh, no, man, look. look, you know, it is me, okay? i come out here and i'm, so used to everyone, you know, kissing my ass and i think I am a fucking star, man, and I am really sorry if I am full of attitude. i, i really...
no, you know what? it is not you, man. it is not anybody. it is me. whoo! hey.
look, man, it... shit. why do not we get something to eat? i mean food?

erica, you coming?
mm-mm.
you got everything right but the car. my dad did not get me a bmw.
what did he get you?
a porsche.
mm.
yeah. so, what about you?
what about me? i do not have a car.
you just seem to know all these things about me and i do not know anything about you, you know. what kind of music do you like?
military marching bands.
you think I am rich and you hate me.
now, how the hell would you know what i think? hm? you do not know me.
I would like to.
oh, yeah?
mm-mm.
you know, it was the biggest mistake of my life.
really?
well, i mean, you have to understand i was just this dopey kid mopping floors and kissing officer ass. i mean, well, i enlisted right out of high school. so i just wanted something different in my life.
mm.
"it's not a job, it is an adventure." right? i hated it. i had to get out. so i was working in the kitchen, chopping lettuce, you know, real heroic stuff, and i, uh, i had this big fucking knife and i chopped off the tip of my little finger and three days later i was a free man.
you cut off your little finger?
well, they, uh they were nice enough to sew it back on.
let's see.
come on, man. sh, sh, sh.
no man.  he is probably the most famous guy that would ever come in this place. you are lucky he is here.
thanks. see man?
you know? i remember coming here with my parents.
really?
you know, i should, um, make a video of this place. you know, bring the camera in.
you make videos?
oh, yeah, all the time. that is what i do now.
you know what would be cool is, like, to do a music video, you know? but, like, you know, have it set in here. you know, like, like, like, with her and shit. you know, like, you know, like, "closed, closed, closed, closed, closed, closed."
"closed, closed, closed." but with your music.
you could do it.
i could.
yeah!
yeah.
i mean, do you have something i could show my manager? i mean, do you have a reel?
yes!
yeah!
a reel?
i mean, what is there to be happy about really? i mean, going to the gym, climbing the stairmaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. sometimes i just want something different, you know?
what was your name again?
erica.
erica. so do you think you and i are alike, erica?
deep down. way down.
it is a mistake to think that.
we could still talk, you know? it is nice to talk.
it is nice to do a lot of things.
that is what i mean.
I am not a nice guy.
i know. it is okay.
yeah?
mm-hm. I am a big girl. i can take care of myself. if i did not want to be here, I would be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for chinese food.
no, no, see, you, you do not understand.
hay? yeah? so teach me a lesson.
you okay, man? you okay?
i did not want to eat this much, man.
wait, I will get you some air.
oh, yuck! oh, gross!
you done?
go!
... idiot! open the damn door! go, go, go, come on!
hey, play that demo again, man. alright.
oh, man. wow. i was never into football, you know?
i gotta take a piss. do you mind if we pull over really quickly?
oh, yeah.
I am sorry. i, i gotta...
oh, no, no. uh, uh, george, pull over.
fuck 'em. fucking assholes.
burnfield. no place like it.
yeah. burnfield, pizza and puke capital of the world.
i can not believe you are still here.
I am moving.
if...
no, I am going.
mm-hm.
soon.
yep.
what is that supposed to mean?
i do not know. i say what i mean.
oh, yeah, you are just so smart.
that is because i am.
it is okay. this kind of thing happens. it is just never happened to me. I am sorry. it is true though. mm. so, um, what is your tcb tattoo stand for? what is that about?
taking care of business.
I am sorry.
i hate it here. it is so ugly, it is like being dead. you got out of here, you know? I am ready to go.
yeah, but sometimes i try to figure out why i left in the first place, you know? i think about people and i wonder what they are doing.
yeah.
i think about you. i mean, a lot.
me?
yeah, i have, i have, yeah.
yeah, you know, when you called i thought, there is a name from the past.
or the future, oh, no, no, i mean... i mean, we will be working on that album cover, right?
yeah, i know what you are saying.
you do?
yeah. god, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.
i just walked all the way from westside to here. i have not walked that far since junior high. i thought you did not drink.
i do not anymore.
can i have some?
knock yourself out.
you know, one moment things are so fucked up than you look at it from a totally different angle and it makes sense.
yeah.
did you ever hear that saying, "this too shall pass"?
sure, all the time, in group.
in group?
rehab. outpatient. i have to go once a week. it is kind of like aa.
oh, yeah, you had to go to highgate. that must have been intense.
intense.
how long were you in there?
uh, ninety days. and now i just have to go once a week. see, I am rehabilitated.
well, you should not drink. are you going to drink?
no. oh, maybe. fuck.
i mean, that would suck if you had to go back to rehab.
yeah, it would suck big time. I would kill myself first.
it was pretty bad, huh?
it was like hell with windows. you know, there is shit on the walls. kids my age sucking their thumbs. i mean, every day i would, I would wake up in my cell and I would think, my parents put me here. why? why? because i stayed out all night one time. uh, because i broke the vcr when i was drunk. because i was out of control. i thought my parents loved me.
we were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. we were getting off on the fact that we are in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. and i got out and i just started walking.
yeah.
well, what it was... i, i do not want to admit it, but, you know, i was jealous of pony.
well, sure, he is rich and he is famous. he is got everything and you have got nothing.
yeah, but, when i was walking, i realized that he is stuck in that limo all the time. he is stuck with his interviews, he is stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? he is not free. he is just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
yeah, i guess.
you know? and it used to scare me so much that i did not know what was coming in my life.
mm-hm.
you know, like, like, i would always think, uh, you know, what if i make the wrong move? but maybe there is not any right move. you know? i mean, look at us. you know, we all dress the same, we all talk the same, we all fuck the same, we all watch the same tv. nobody's really different, even if they think they are different. "oh, boy, look at my tattoo, you know?" and see, that is what makes me freak. because i can do anything i want, as long as i do not care about the result.
is that jeff?
oh, my god!
you know, my mom has this saying.
yeah?
"don't write any checks you can not cash."
really? what else does your mother say?
oh, hi. i thought you guys got lost.
hey, where did you go? we were worried about you.
uh, home, you know.
yeah, i talked to your mom. i think i woke her up. i hope i did not get you in trouble.
you did not get me in trouble.
hey, where is erica?
i do not know.
gee, jeff, i thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
no, no. i just got sick and tired of listening to that demo tape over and over again, you know? i mean, i felt like a fucking groupie, you know.
mm. i enjoyed the ride. sorry you didn't.
but wait! sooze, i do not wanna fight. I am so sorry.
what?
no, i mean it. no, look, when, when i got out of the car i walked all the way here.
mm-hm.
and i fig- and i figured something out.
oh, yeah?
i, yeah.
mm.
hey! on behalf of burnfield, i present to you the keys to the city.
so, how was the ride, kids?
great.
really?
it was the nicest thin I have done in a long time.
oh that is nice for you.
where is erica? you seen her?
erica? she said she was tired. she went back to the hotel.
oh, how did she get back?
i called bucky's. i got her a cab. is there any hot mustard?
i do not know.
I am going to go to the car for a 'sec. I will be right back.
they are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? fuck off!
wait, sooze, i, i have to talk to you, 'cause i, there is something i figured out.
god, you smell like whiskey.
no, no, i have to talk to you.
is that a threat?
i ate a dog when i was in thailand. tasted exactly like this sparerib.
no, wait, no, i thought about new york.
forget about new york, jeff. i do not want to talk about new york anymore.
there was this other place where they served live monkey brains. sweat to god. you walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it is brains while it is still alive. i did not go in, though, 'cause i did not have any money and my mom has a saying: "don't write any checks you can not cash".
tim, what are you talking about?
ask your girlfriend.
well, i called erica's beeper. there is just no answer.
what are you? her pimp? she said she might go get a drink first.
well, i mean, she always answers her beeper.
pal, she is a big girl, you know? I am sure she is alright.
yeah? well, what did she say?
about what?
about where she went. i mean, what bar?
she did not say. maybe she is at the bar at the hotel.
the bar at the hotel? she told you that? what did she say exactly?
well, dad, she said she wanted to suck my cock.
tim, why do not you shut the fuck up?
i think i gotta go.

oh yes! yeah, man, give her the ride, the old pony ride back to the hotel.
tim, go throw up somewhere.
you know, man, it is none of your business what i do, okay?

I am not suffering, you know. i do not give a shit.
good. that is good.
yeah. yeah, no, you are right. it is no big deal, you know. guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. in a few minutes they will be back at the four seasons. you ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
no.
well, it am not no pup tent in the garage, you know what i mean? fuck. so they will talk and talk. they will probably talk all night. and, oh, they will decide that they are going to spend the night together, right? but, you know, they are going to keep their underwear on and they are not going to do anything. by six a.m. he is parking the pink cadillac. fuck. there is really only one answer.

well, i, you know, i took her to the van, you know. it was goin' all hot and heavy and she started hanging on me, you know? and she started crying, "tim, tim, what is the matter? i love you. do not go!" and i was just looking at her stupid face and her stupid eyes, stupid mouth and i was filled with disgust, man. and i fuckin'... oh, man, i really...
what did you do?
i hit her.
you hit her? oh, wait, wait a minute. why did you hit her?
because i was fucked up, man. i just kept hittin' her till she did not move anymore.
wait a minute, wait a minute. she is unconscious?

oh fuck.

i do not know.
you know, it is not you. you know? you seem like a smart guy.

glad it is okay.
I will tell you what. when i get my engineering degree and I am swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
um, if you are talking to me, could you make some sense? 'cause i do not speak swahili.

good. see you later.
you are a drunk and an idiot.

yeah, well, uh, you are not so smart, chief, 'cause I am moving out to l.a.
ah, that is nice. they have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
yeah. get ahold of sooze?
no, no, i was not trying.
she was at the four seasons last night, man. but you should not worry about that.

no, no.
i feel really bad about that, but i was busy, you know, i mean...
no, look, this is not about sooze, alright. wait, wait, wait, wait. she stayed at the four seasons last night with pony?
yeah, we all stayed at the four seasons, man. it was party time. hey, i hung out with danny, pony's manager. really nice guy. we talked about the video. they want a raw look. something fresh. danny said if i can capture the reality of burnfield, it would make a great tape.
okay, buff, listen to me for a second alright?
no, i know what you are going to say. i do not know anything about making a video. but that is a plus.
no.
because since I am just starting out, I have got a fresh point of view, and that is good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
buff, listen to me. could you just-
but i'd, I would do it for free. you know, just for my reel.
buff, can you listen to me for a second?
oh, and guess who showed up.
no, shut up! look, look, alright, tim is in trouble.
i know, man.

hey! hey.
I am so burnt-out.
oh, how did you get burnt-out?

yeah?
oh, my god, you found it. thank you so much.  did you get your tape?
yup. hey, um, so, um, listen, man, i got to go show the tape to danny at the hotel, and if i get the gig, erica is gonna teach me how to surf in l.a.
oh, I will teach you how to surf even if you do not get the gig.
i can come visit?
you better! yes!
i will.
it was really nice meeting you, jeff. if you are ever in l.a., you should come by the offices. i talked to pony earlier. he said he had a really nice time and he is really looking forward to reading some of your songs.
ow! hey! get the heck in there!  hey... not dead! definitely not dead!
guess not.
see, i was not making shit up, man.
no.
god, tim lied to your ass, man. that guy's sad, man. well, uh, i got to go, but, uh, listen, if i do not come back, I will send a video of me surfing. alright, man? get some rest. go with the flow.
alright. 'bye, buff.
hey, man.
hey.

yeah, of course they let me out. chickenshits. i got to pay some class c misdemeanor ticket. so did i call it or did i call it? she spent the night, did not she? hm? oh, that sucks for you, pal. oh, shit.
you lied to me.
you want to know what your problem is, jeff? you want to believe so bad, you will buy anything. it is true. look at you. you are gullible and you are gutless.
no, no. that is not the way it is at all. no, i stayed up all night trying to figure out how to protect my best friend. wait, yeah, no, i was trying to come up with some lie so that you would not have to go to jail for the rest of your life.
wow. you did that for me?
yes.
well, you know, all i can say is, you are a fucking fool.
why? because i give a shit?
oh, shit.
because i care, I am a fucking fool?
oh, jeff, give me a break. you did not even have the guts to go look in the van, did you?
oh no, no. you know what? fuck that. no, you lied to me. you lied to me because you are gutless. you are a gutless, drunken looser.
I am a loser. and I am drunk. but I am not gutless.
you know, and what are you doing here in the first place, man? he is just going to call the cops again.
good, good. i, i hope he does.
the sun has not even come up yet and you are drinking.
hey, you saw that brown bitch point a gun at me last night, man. did you think she was gonna use it?
i do not know.
you do not know?
no.
come on. you do not think that after they called the cops on me, her and mohammed had a nice laugh?
no.
no? well, i disagree. i think they did. i think they probably went home last night and, you know, kicked off their sandals and had a nice laugh about the drunk on the corner, you know? makes me sick.
what are, what are you doing? look, tim, just go home. alright. go home and sleep it off.
well, what am i supposed to sleep off? my life? you know, I am supposed to go home and go to sleep and when i wake up, what will i be, jeff? a pilot? maybe a super bowl quarterback or, no, maybe a fucking rock star. right? i do not think so, man.
just go home, alright?
this is my home.
why, why did you start this in the first place, man? they never hurt you.
they never hurt me? they hurt me every day with their attitude. you know, like they even have a right. who the fuck do they think they are? let me tell you something, i was born here. alright? I am an american. and I am owed something. look, they took it from me.
they are just people. alright? they got feelings, you know?
what about my feelings? what about my fucking feelings? these assholes, they come over here, they know all the answers, right? well, they do not know shit.
will you just put the gun down?
no.
just put it down.
jeff, stay there.
he is got a gun. he is got a gun.
well, then, there now, why do not you go inside and call the cops and I will come in there and blow your fucking brains out.
why should i call the police, huh? they do not so any good.
well, you got to call your wife then, you know, 'cause she kind of handles these heavy matters anyway, right?
no. no, you see, i do not have to call my wife.
well, what about this?
what about this, huh? go ahead, big man.

you know, why do you call me names? you know, i never hurt you. I am only working here.
yeah, yeah. that is the fucking problem.
no, wait, wait! wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! what is your name?
