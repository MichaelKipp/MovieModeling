well, look here!
ladies and gentlemen: the "straub country-residence".
damn, this thing is heavy. where do you want to have it?
tenth floor.
very funny.
look at this.  the lock is totally demolished.
i guess someone lost their key. you did get your tetanus shots, i hope?
twenty-three, to be exact.
i wonder how you guys figure on renovating this whole place.  you can afford to spend some money.  if i was you, I would spare myself all the hard work.  besides, did not you want to start writing again?
why else?
come on, say it.  you know...
say it anyway.  come on, how much do you love me?
"with you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
i have to cut his windpipe...
you are not a doctor, you will hurt him!
what else should i do, damn it, he is dying!
ellen, move aside...
oh god, tommi...
stop that!
you will never get away from me!
so, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
they say it is fantastic.  at least that is what i read in a men's magazine.  so who are the two lucky ones?
me and the muse, of course.  how is your book coming along?
oh, the muse... we are still having our differences.  you know how it is with women.
well then, i guess I would better leave the two of you alone.  but do not forget...
what kind of a horrible thing is that?
it still worked in town.
i mean the armchair!
oh, that was upstairs.  a real antiquity!  i think it is great.
maybe the antenna's broken.
we are probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! damned box!
hey... the fuse.
oh, damnit!
do you know where fuse box is?
in the cellar, i think. wait, I will take care of it.
look at this!  we will have to fix the whole wiring.  this stuff is dangerous as hell.
we will call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
are you crazy?  that costs a fortune!
do you have a better idea?
I will do it myself.
you?
my father was an electrician. already forgot that?
my father was a pilot.  and do i know how to fly?
hey, flower child, the sixties are over.  and this stuff is hazardous to your health.
yes, daddy.
where are you going?
well, if you will not let me smoke grass, then at least I will go get myself some cigarettes.
what are you doing?
making our very own solstice fire.
is everything alright?  are not you feeling well?
i just had a really strange experience.
maybe i should talk to dr. roth about it.
hey, take your time.  you know time heals better than any shrink ever can.
i have a funny feeling.  do you think we will get over all that is happened?
we just have to make a new beginning.
cherry-red tears.
what?
cherry-red tears, your first book. i read it at least nine times.  and then i found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
not a book fair.  i was signing autographs in a department store.
i was so excited about meeting you. again and again, i kept getting in the back of the line so i could be the last to talk to you.
and two months later, we got married.  and all because of one sentence:  "with you, my life began and with you shall it end..."
i miss tommi so much.
so do i, believe me.
do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
maybe different.  i do not know, ellen.
if we stand a chance at all, it is only by sticking together.
hello.  can i help you?
does this dog here belong to you?
no, I have never seen him before.
you know, i saw him sitting outside your gate...  oh, I am sorry, I am forgetting my manners again!  i have not even introduced myself yet. hi, my name's lindner. karl lindner.
ellen straub.
it is a pleasure.  you are from the city, right?
do i look like it that much?
village gossip.  you are a real attraction here.
i guess it is too lonely for most folks.  it is time for me to get going. it is been a pleasure meeting you.
wait, will not you join me for a cup of coffee?
who was that?
someone from the village.
martin, it is not funny!
you know, it is not always easy for me, either.  but at least i try not to give in to each and every neurosis.
well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. do not you remember what we promised to each other?  honesty - trust!
come on, this is not about honesty. you just need a good night's sleep. the way you toss and turn all night, even i hardly get any sleep.
now, what did i do to deserve this?
come on, at least try one.  it took me two hours to make these.
so, did you sleep good?
yeah... i have to go to town.
hey, you are still here.  i suppose you like it here with us.
no, thanks.  i have everything i need.  drive safely, you hear?
listen, it is one thing to have a guilt complex. but i know the difference between when I am overstrung and when I am seeing things that are simply not there! besides, it only began after we moved!
there is, of course, another possible explanation which i dearly hope is not the case.
and that is?
a tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
do not tell me you have made friends with that wandering flea circus?
why not?  she can guard the house. by the way, i gave her a name: clara.
where have you been all day?
i went to see prof. roth!  you know, i had another one of those dreams last night.  i saw tommi!
but that is not the point! what if all these things are somehow connected?
oh, baloney.  you should just hear yourself talk!
oh, mrs. straub.  may i introduce you to my wife?
just call me elisabeth.
ellen.
you are doing fine, are not you?  i mean... the two of you alone in that house, so far out in the moor.
stop scaring people.  let's go. we need to be on our way.
excuse us.  but do stop by for a visit sometime!  you are welcome anytime.
you did not tell her!
we should leave the past alone.
well, it will never leave us alone as long as you ignore it.
where have you been?
in the village.  look what i found.
"events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
ellen, what are you trying to prove, anyway?  that we have created ourselves a ghost?  come on!
it is just a feeling.  do not you sense it, too?
what? what am i supposed to sense?
the house - tommi - something just does not jive here...
who is that?
i have not the slightest idea.
hey, my man!  how is the masterpiece coming along?
not so bad, if i could get some peace and quiet around here.
what?
look at this!  the dog!  she is dead!
she was old.
old?!  come look at this!  she has wounds.  wounds on her head.  like thrashes.  or bites.
maybe an animal.
an animal?  what kind of animal? a goddamned t-rex, or what?
oh, ellen!  I have been wondering when you would come.  why do not you step in.
thank you.
i really hate to bother him, but...
oh no, no.  you are not bothering him.  he has lots of time since he is been retired.
you know, after doing that job for so many years, you learn to appreciate the simple things in life.  flowers incorporate a beauty that i always missed in life.  but certainly, you are not here to chat about my hobbies.
1976.  what happened back then?
do yourself a favor:  do not ask.
i appreciate your concern, but we live in that house.  i need to know what happened in there.
frank kosinski.  here's the address.  go see him.  ask him.
thank you.  elisabeth, i did not mean to...
that is alright.  do not misunderstand my husband.  it is only that he is already had enough problems with this case. and who would believe him if he told the truth?
but what is the truth?
i do not know all about what happened back then.  but it always stood between me and my husband.
let me guess:  another short circuit?
hi, darling.
during the middle ages people were executed at every corner.  what is your point?
this house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
okay, so the house has a history and there might still be a couple of corpses in the moors.  "there is something negative about the place..."  what the hell are you trying to say?  come on!  spit it out!
will you finally cut it out?  just in case you have not noticed, i am trying to write a book here.  and maybe - even with your birdbrains - you can figure it is a pretty tough job. so why can not you just leave me alone?
damn it, look at you!  do not you see what is happening with you?  we need to get out of here, do not you understand?  out of this house!
martin, what-
it is simply too dangerous here! but no, you always have to have it your way.
you know what i have to do now, and believe me:  i do not enjoy doing this.
martin, damnit, what are you up to? let go of me!
of course you will give me the blame again.  like back then.  just a tiny cut and he could still be alive today - is not that right, ellen?
what are you talking about-
mrs. straub!
I have killed my husband!
what?
i think I have killed him.  martin, my husband, I have killed him!  that is, I am not sure, but...
it all went so fast.  he was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver.  i only wanted to defend myself.  you have to call the police...
we can do all of that later, but first you need to calm down.
oh, ellen.  my sweet ellen... of course i knew.
we loved each other once.  have you forgotten that?
i think it is starting again. you know... there was something peculiar.  if only i knew...
peculiar?  you mean, like back then?
yes, something was...
hammer?
how could i fail to notice that! - i have to go...
i told you, there is no way out. he will not let you go.
'he'?  whom do you mean-
it is important - he knows the last chapter.
your book - that is why you were always in the cellar!
you know, tommi wants me to become the man i used to be.
...so he is dictating you a new bestseller?  whatever that is, it is not our son.
what?
i have a yearning for... smog, cars and many, many people... a real dirty... big city. what do you think?
how did you get me out of there?
i would not have made it by myself.
for god's sake, what happened to me?
you do not remember?
