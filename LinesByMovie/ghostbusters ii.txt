frank, do you think you could give me a hand with these bags?
i'm not a doorman, miss barrett.  i'm a building superintendent.
you're also a human being, frank.
okay, okay.  it's not my job, but what the hell.  i'll do you a favor.  he takes the grocery bags from her.
thank you, frank.  i'll get the hang of this eventually.
hiya, oscar.  what do you say, slugger?
that's a good-looking kid you got there, ms. barrett.
thank you, frank.  oh, are you ever going to fix the radiator in my bedroom?  i asked you last week.
didn't i do it?
no, you didn't, frank.
okay, that's no problem.
that's exactly what you said last week.
ready?
i'm ready.
then let's do it.
that's it, ray.  i've had it.  no more parties. i'm tired of taking abuse from over-privileged nine-year-olds.
come on, winston.  we can't quit now.  the holidays are coming up.  it's our best season.
give it up, ray.  you're living in the past. ghostbusters doesn't exist anymore.  in a year these kids won't even remember who we are.
ungrateful little yuppie larvae.  after all we did for this city.
yeah, what did we do, ray?  the last real job we had we bubbled up a hundred foot marshmallow man and blew the top three floors off an uptown highrise.
yeah, but what a ride.  you can't make a hamburger without chopping up a cow.
hi, welcome back to the 'world of the psychic,' i'm peter venkman and i'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, milton anglund.  milt, your new book is called the end of the world.  isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
well, i think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
okay, so can you tell us when it's going to happen or do we have to buy the book?
i predict that the world will end at the stroke of midnight on new year's eve.
this year?  that's cutting it a little close, isn't it?  i mean, just from a sales point of view, the book just came out, right?  so you're not even looking at the paperback release for maybe a year.  and it's going to be at least another year after that if the thing has movie-of-the-week or mini-series potential. you would have been better off predicting 1992 or even '94 just to be safe.
this is not just some money-making scheme!  i didn't just make up the date.  i have a strong psychic belief that the world will end on new year's eve.
well, for your sake, i hope you're right.  but i think my other guest may disagree with you. elaine, you had another date in mind?
according to my sources, the world will end on february 14, in the year 2016.
valentine's day.  that's got to be a bummer. where did you get that date, elaine?
i received this information from an alien.  i was at the paramus holiday inn, i was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
your alien had a room in the holiday inn?
it may have been a room on the spacecraft made up to look like a room in the holiday inn.  i can't be sure, peter.
no, you can't, and i think that's the whole problem with aliens; you just can't trust them. you may get some nice ones occasionally like starman or e.t., but most of them turn out to be some kind of lizard.  anyway, we're just about out of time.  next week on 'world of the psychic,' hairless pets.  until then, this is peter venkman saying ...  ... good night.
can i help you?
yeah, you can get your hand off my chest.
i'm jack hardemeyer.  i'm the mayor's assistant. what can i do for you?
i'm an old friend of the mayor's.  i just want to say hello to him.
i know who you are, doctor venkman.  busting any ghosts lately?
no, that's what i want to talk to the mayor about.  we did a little job for the city a while back and we ended up getting sued, screwed and tattooed by deskworms like you.
look, you stay away from the mayor.  next fall, barring a disaster, he's going to be elected governor of this state and the last thing we need is for him to be associated with two-bit frauds and publicity hounds like you and your friends.  you read me?
oh, yes, i got in a little late this morning, janosz.
you know, you are really doing very good work here.  i think soon you may be ready to assist me in some of the more important restorations.
thank you, janosz.  i've learned a lot here, but now that my baby's a little older, i was hoping to rejoin the orchestra.
we'll be very sorry to lose you.  perhaps i could take you to lunch today?
actually, i'm not eating lunch today.  i have an appointment.  in fact, i'd better go.
every day i ask you, and every day you've got something else to do.  do i have bad breath or something?
i'm sorry.  perhaps some other time.
okay, i'll take a raincheck on that.
hundreds of people.  believe me, i didn't imagine this.
i'm not saying you did.  in science we always look for the simplest explanation.
what are you working on, egon?
i'm trying to determine whether human emotional states have a measurable effect on the psychomagnetheric energy field.  it's a theory ray and i were working on when we had to dissolve ghostbusters.
we'll do the happiness index next.  i'd like to bring ray in on your case, if it's all right with you.
okay, whatever you think -- but not venkman.
oh no.
do you ever see him?
occasionally
how is he these days?
venkman?  i think he was borderline for a while there.  then he crossed the border.
does he ever mention me?
no.  not that i can recall.
this is my address and telephone number. will you call me?
certainly.
egon, i'd rather you didn't mention any of this to peter if you don't mind.
i won't.
thank you.
who was that?
some crank.  looking for goat hooves.  come up with anything?
this one's interesting.  berlin, 1939, a flower cart took off by itself and rolled approximately half a kilometer over level ground.  three hundred eyewitnesses.
you might want to check those duke university mean averaging studies on controlled psychokinesis.
good idea.
oh, hello, perhaps you could help me.  i'm looking for an aerosol love potion i could spray on a certain penthouse pet that would make her unconditionally submit to an unusual personal request.
oh, hiya, pete.
so, no goat hooves, huh?
i knew that voice sounded familiar.  what's up?  how's it going?
nowhere -- fast.  why don't you lock up and buy me a sub?
uh, i can't.  i'm kind of working on something.
egon!
hello, venkman.
how've you been?  how's teaching?  i bet those science chicks really dig that big cranium of yours, huh?
i think they're more interested in my epididymis.
i don't even want to know where that is.
great.  so what are you guys working on?
oh, just checking something for an old friend.
who?
who?  just -- someone we know.
oh, ray --
who?  who?  who?
aaah!  nobody!  i can't tell you!
who, ray?
dana!  dana barrett!
hi, ray.  it's good to see you.  thanks for coming.
no problem.  always glad to help -- and hug.
hi, egon.
hello, peter.
you know, dana, i'm very very hurt that you didn't call me first.  i'm still into all this stuff, you know.  haven't you ever seen my show?
i have.  that's why i didn't call you first.
i can see that you're still very bitter about us, but in the interest of science, i'm going to give it my best shot.  let's go to work, boys.
so what happened to mr. right?  i hear he ditched you and the kid and moved to europe.
he didn't "ditch" me.  we had some problems, he got a good offer from an orchestra in england and he took it.
he ditched you.  you should've married me, you know.
you never asked me, and every time i brought it up you'd get drowsy and fall asleep.
men are very sensitive, you know.  we need to feel loved and desired, too.
well, when you started introducing me as "the old ball and chain," that's when i left.
i may have a few personal problems but one thing i am is a total professional.
i'd like to have a stool specimen
yeah, you would.  is that for personal or professional reasons?
what do you think?
there's no doubt about it.  he's got his father's looks.  the kid is ugly -- extremely ugly.  and smelly.  you stink!  it's just horrible.  you are the stinkiest baby i ever smelled.  what's his name?
his name is oscar.
oscar!  you poor kid!
peter, this is serious.  i need to know if you think there's anything unusual about him.
unusual?  i don't know.  i haven't had a lot of experience with babies.
i'll do it.
i'll supervise.
well, holmes, what do you think?
it's an interesting one, pete.  if anything was going on it's totally subdued now.
what now, brainiac?
i think we should see if we can find anything abnormal on the street.
finding something abnormal on the street shouldn't be too hard.
brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?  there's our old cash machine.  and the dry cleaners we used to go to.  and the old video store.  we really had some good times, didn't we?
we definitely had a moment or two.
that's where the buggy stopped.
okay, let's take a look.
is this the spot?
a little to the left.  right there!  that's where it stopped.
nothing.  not a trace.
why don't we try the giga-meter?
what's that?
egon and i have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in gevs - giga electron volts.
that's a thousand million electron volts.
i knew that.
i think we hit the honeypot, boys.  there's something brewing under the street.
peter, do you think maybe i have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.
i, vigo, the scourge of carpathia, the sorrow of moldavia, command you.
command me, lord.
on a mountain of skulls in a castle of pain, i sat on a throne of blood.  what was will be, what is will be no more.  now is the season of evil.  find me a child that i might live again.
i love this.  we're onto something really big.  i can smell it, ray.  we're going to make some headlines with this one.
hey, hey, hey, stresshound!  are you nuts? if anybody found out about this we'd be in serious trouble.  the judge couldn't have been clearer - no ghostbusting.
relax.  we're going to keep this whole thing nice and quiet, low key, no profile.
you were supposed to help me with this.
you need the exercise.
the new york pneumatic railway.  it was an experimental subway system.  fan-forced air-trains, built around 1870.
this is about as deep as you can go under manhattan without digging your own hole.
what's the reading?
janosz?
hello, dana.  i happened to be in the neighborhood and i thought i'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? are you okay?  is the baby all right?
do you need anything?  you want me to come in?
no, everything's fine.  honestly.  thanks anyway.
okay, just thought i'd check.  good night, dana.  sleep well.  don't let the bedbugs bite you.
good night, janosz.
seems like a pretty open-minded guy, huh?
his nickname is "the hammer."
i wish i could stay.  i feel personally responsible for you being here.
you are personally responsible.  if i can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at sing sing?
please don't say that.  you won't go to prison.
don't worry about me.  i'm like a cat.
you mean you cough up hairballs all over the rug?
i'm el gato.  i always land on my feet.
good luck.
thanks.
hey, i didn't imagine it.  there must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
it may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
the witness is leading him.  sustained.
okay, let me rephrase that question.  didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
yes, i did.  we were city champs.
objection.  irrelevant and immaterial.
sustained.  mr. tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
do i?
so, dr. venkman, please explain to the court why it is you and your co-defendants took it upon yourselves to dig a big hole in the middle of the street.
seventy-seventh and first avenue has so many holes already we didn't think anyone would notice.
keep that up, mister, and i'll find you in contempt.
sorry, your honor, but when somebody sets me up like that i can't resist.
i'll ask you again, dr. venkman.  why were you digging the hole?  and please remember that you're under oath.
i had my fingers crossed when they swore me in, but i'm going to tell you the truth. there are things in this world that go way beyond human understanding, things that can't be explained and that most people don't want to know about anyway.  that's where we come in.
so what are you saying?  that the world of the supernatural is your special province?
no, i guess i'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
your honor, may i approach the bench?
yes.
can i have some of your water?
get on with it, counselor!
your honor, ladies and gentlemen of the --  audience.  i don't think it's fair to call my clients frauds.  okay, the blackout was a big problem for everybody.  i was stuck in an elevator for about three hours and i had to go to the bathroom the whole time, but i don't blame them because once i turned into a dog and they helped me.  thank you.
that's it?  that's all you have to say?
did i forget something?
you've got to do something!
who are they?
they're the scoleri brothers.  i tried them for murder.  they were electrocuted up at ossining in '48.  now they want to kill me.
maybe they just want to appeal.
these boys aren't playing around.
you've got to stop them.  please!
geez, i forgot how heavy these things are.
okay, let's heat 'em up!
what is it, honey?
it's that darn ghost again!  i don't know what to do anymore.  he just won't leave us alone.  i guess we'll just have to move.
don't worry.  we're not moving.  he is.
who are you going to call?
ghostbusters.
i'm ray --
i'm peter --
i'm egon --
and we're the ...
careful, winston.  he's a mean one.  and to celebrate our grand reopening, we're giving you twice the value with our special half-price 'welcome back' service plan.
hold on, ray!  half-price!  have you gone crazy?
i guess so, pete, because that's not all. tell them what else we've got, egon.
you know he ran that last lap in under six minutes?
if he wasn't dead he'd be an olympic prospect.
so this is what you do, huh?
oh, hello, peter.
you're really good, you know.
i didn't paint it.  i'm just cleaning it. it's an original ver meer.  it's worth about ten million dollars.
i'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
as a matter of fact, i stopped by to tell you that i haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
dana, aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
oh, i'm sorry.  this is peter venkman. peter, janosz poha.
pleasure to meet you.  i've seen you on television.
how are you?  what's that you're working on, johnny?
it's a painting i'm restoring for the new byzantine exhibition.  it's a self-portrait of prince vigo, the carpathian.  he ruled most of carpathia and moldavia in the 17th century.
too bad for the moldavians.

he was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. i hate this painting.  i've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  you know what it needs?  a fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
we don't go around altering valuable paintings, dr. venkman.
well, i'd make an exception in this case if i were you.
i'll let you get back to it.  nice meeting you.
my pleasure.
i may be wrong, but i think you've got a little crush on this guy.
good-bye, peter.
i'd like to stay, but i really don't have time to hang around here.  i'll call you.  later, johnny!
oh good, you're here.  spengler and i have something really amazing to show you.
it's not that thing you do with your nostrils, is it?
and now you're going to eat it?
no, i'm just restoring it to its normal state.
this is what you do with your spare time?
this is an incredible breakthrough, venkman. a psychoreactive substance!  whatever this is, it clearly responds to human emotional states.
'mood slime.'  we ought to bottle this stuff and sell it.
we've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
you mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
like a goat on garbage.
we're running tests to see if we can get an equally strong positive reaction.
what kind of tests?
well, we sing to it, we talk to it, we say supportive, nurturing things --
you're not sleeping with this stuff, are you?
does it have any favorites?
it likes all the sappy stuff: 'cumbaya,' 'everything is beautiful,' 'it's a small world' -- but it loves jackie wilson.
i don't care what you say.  this could be a major christmas gift item.
right, and the first time someone gets mad, their toaster will eat their hand.
so we'll put a warning on the label.
i'm sorry.  were you on your way out?
no, i just got in -- a couple hours ago. come on in.  are we having a pajama party?
peter, the bathtub tried to eat oscar.
you know, if anyone else told me that, i'd have serious doubts.  but coming from you, i can't honestly say i'm surprised.
i must be losing my mind.  at the museum today i could have sworn that terrible painting of vigo looked right at me.
who could blame him?  were you wearing this nightgown?
i don't know what to do anymore.
i'll get ray and egon to check out the bathtub.  you better stay here.
this is joe namath's old number, you know. you could get a lot of chicks with this. just don't pee in it.
peter, what about the bathtub?
we'll take care of that.  ray, pete.  listen, get over to dana's right away ... her bathtub pulled a fast one -- tried to eat the kid.
it was full of this awful pink ooze.
sounds like another slime job ... no, they're all right.  they're here now ... right ... let me know.
bathroom's right here -- let me just tidy up a few things.
peter, this is very nice, but you don't have to do any of this, you know.
be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. but the bed's good and i just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  in fact, i think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
really?  and how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
for me it's best if i sleep on my side and you spoon up right behind me with your arms around me.  if we go the other way i'm afraid your hair will be getting in my face all night.
how about you on the sofa and me in bed with the baby.
or we could do that.
thank you.  poor baby.  i think i should put him down now.
i'll put him down for you.  you are way too short!  and your belly-button sticks out!  you're nothing but a burden to your poor mother!
did you find anything at dana's?
nothing.  just some mood-slime residue in and around the bathtub.  but we did turn up some interesting stuff on this vigo character you mentioned.  i found the name vigo the carpathian in leon zundinger's magicians, martyrs and madmen.  listen to this:
"vigo the carpathian, born 1505, died 1610 --"
a hundred and five years?  he really hung on, didn't he.
and he didn't die of old age either.  he was poisoned, stabbed, shot, hung, stretched, disemboweled, drawn and quartered.
i guess he wasn't too popular at the end there.
no, not exactly a man of the people.  "also known as vigo the cruel, vigo the torturer, vigo the despised, and vigo the unholy."
this guy was a bad monkey.  he dabbled in all the black arts, and listen to this prophecy.  just before his head died, his last words were, "death is but a door, time is but a window.  i'll be back."
that's it?  "i'll be back?"
it's a rough translation from the moldavian.
you got a flux and a half.
now if you don't want to be the --  -- fifth person ever to die in meta-shock from a planar rift, i suggest you get down behind that desk and don't move until we give you the signal "stabilize -- all clear."
dr. venkman?  dana is not here.
i know.
then why have you come?
we got a major creep alert and we're just going down the list.  your name was first.
you know, i never got to ask you.  where you from, johnny?
the upper west side.
this is the one that looked at dana.
it must be the chemical fumes in the studio. people start imagining things --
i'm going to rule out the glue-sniffing theory.  if she says it looked at her, it looked at her.  hey, you!  vigie!  look at me.  i'm talking to you.  hey!  look at me when i'm talking to you.
beautiful, beautiful.  work with me, baby. just have fun with it.  okay, he's playing it cool.  let's finish up and get out of here.
i'll get one more reading.
now that's one ugly dude.
huh?  what?
you finished here?
what?  yeah.
are you all right?  you coming down with something?
no, i'm fine.  i just got light-headed for a second there.  let's go.
so you see, everything is in order, is it not?
not.  don't leave town and report any change in your address to the proper authorities. we'll be back.
there's definitely something going on in that studio.  the pke levels were max-plus and the giga-meter was showing all red.
i'd put my money on that vigo character.
are you telling me how to drive?
no, i just thought --
well don't think!
what happened?
you just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
are you all right?
yeah, i guess so.  it was the strangest thing.  i knew what i was doing but i couldn't stop.  this really terrible feeling came over me and -- i don't know -- i just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  whew!  sorry, boys.
are you all squeaky clean now?
yes, i'm very clean.  did they find anything at my apartment?
they didn't find anything?  in the bathtub ... the pink ooze ... nothing?  so, what do i do now?
now you get dressed and we go out.  i got a babysitter and everything.  trust me, you need it.
i'm not here to date.  i can't leave oscar in a strange place with someone i don't know.
it's janine melnitz, from my staff.  she's one of my most valuable employees.
does she know anything about babies?
janine melnitz, are you kidding?  do i have a vase?  i brought some of your clothes.  wear something intriguing.  i brought along some interesting possibilities.
okay, but it's not a date.  it's a dinner.
did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
i put them in your hamper.  i thought they were dirty.
i have a hamper?  next time ask me first, okay.  i have more than two grades of laundry.  there're lots of subtle levels between clean and dirty.
oh migod!  i'm sorry.  i didn't mean to do that.  it was an accident.
what are you doing up here?
i was trying to get that smelly green thing. the guys asked me to help out.  i'm like the fifth ghostbuster.
why would you want to be a ghostbuster if you're already an accountant?
oh, no, it's just if one of the guys calls in sick or gets hurt.
have you made any plans yet?  you know tomorrow is new year's eve.
no, i celebrate at the beginning of my corporate tax year which is march first. that way i beat the crowds.
that's very practical.  i hate going out on new year's eve, too.
well, good night, louis.
janine, do you feel like maybe getting something to eat on the way home?
i'd like to, but i told dr. venkman i'd babysit.  do you want to babysit with me?
oh, sure, that sounds great.
don't tell me, let me guess.  all-you-can-eat barbecue rib night at the sizzler?
we're going down into the sewer system to see if we can trace the source of the psycho-reactive slime flow.  we thought you might want to come along.
darn it!  i wish i'd known you were going. i'm stuck with these damn dinner reservations.
you know, animals and lower life forms often anticipate major disasters.  given the new magnetheric readings we could see a tremendous breeding surge in the cockroach population.
roach breeding?  sounds better and better.  dana?  the boys are going down under the sewers tonight to look for slime.  egon thinks there might even be some kind of big roach-breeding surge.  should we forget about dinner and go with them instead?
i think we're going to have to pass on the sewer trip, boys.  let me know what you find out.
okay, but you're missing all the fun.
six feet -- seven -- eight --
that's it.  it's on the bottom.
nine feet -- ten --
is the line sinking?
no, the slime is rising.
so -- are you making any new year's resolutions?
i want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
does that start exactly at midnight tomorrow, or could you hold off for a few days maybe?
for one night in your life, do you think it's possible for us to be completely real?
all right, you want to be real?  so tell me why did you dump me?
oh, peter, i didn't dump you.  i just had to protect myself.  you really weren't very good for me, you know.
i'm not even good for me.
why do you say things like that?  you're so much better than you know.
thank you.  if i had that kind of support on a daily basis, i could definitely shape up by the turn of the century.
so why don't you give me a jingle in the year 2000?
let me jingle you right now.
maybe i should call janine.
don't worry.  janine has a very special way with children.
i can't believe a person could actually live like this.
so these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.
it's really not a bad place.  it just needs a woman's touch.
so they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which i'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so i guess it's all right.  i can finish this later if you're tired.
you're really good with children, louis.  i can tell.  why don't you come here and sit with me?
okay.
motherhood is a very natural instinct for me.  i'd like to have a baby myself. wouldn't you?
tonight?
nice going, ray!  what were you trying to do -- drown me?
look, zeddemore, it wasn't my fault you were too stupid to drop that line.
you better watch your mouth, man, or i'll punch your lights out.
oh yeah?  anytime, anytime.  just go ahead and try it.
if you two are looking for a fight, you got one.  who wants it first?  come on, ray.  try me, sucker.
butt out, you pencil-necked geek.  i've had it with you.
what are we doing?  ray, i was ready to kill you.
don't you see?  it's the slime.  that stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
you should've been there, venkman. absolutely incredible!
yeah, sorry i missed it.  i guess you guys didn't know about the dress code here.  it's really kind of a coat and tie place.
it's all over the city, pete -- well, under it actually.
rivers of the stuff!
and it's all flowing toward the museum.
sorry!
maybe we should discuss this somewhere else.
boys, listen.  you're scaring the straights. let's save this until tomorrow, okay?
this won't wait until tomorrow, venkman. it's hot and it's ready to pop.
should we go?
i don't think we should leave her alone.
you're right.  we should stay.
i, vigo, the scourge of carpathia --
yes, the scourge --
-- the sorrow of moldavia --
-- the sorrow --
i command you.
i await the word of vigo.
the season of evil begins with the birth of the new year.  bring me the child that i might live again.
lord vigo, the mother, dana, is fine and strong.  i was wondering -- well, would it be possible -- if i bring the baby, could i have the woman?
so be it.  on this the day of darkness, she will be ours, wife to you and mother to me.
tell him about the toaster.
i don't think he's ready for the toaster.
that's quite a story.
yeah, i think the times might be interested, don't you?  the post might have a lot of fun with it, too.
before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
now you're talking.
what do you want with my baby?
no harm will come to the child.  you might even say it's a privilege.  he will be the vessel for the spirit of vigo.  and you -- well, you will be the mother of the ruler of the world.  doesn't that sound nice?
if this is what the world will be like, i don't want to live in it.
i don't believe we have the luxury of choice.
everybody has a choice.
not in this case, my dear.  take a look. that's not gainsborough's blue boy up there. he's vigo!
i don't care who he is.  he's not taking my baby.
it better not start yet.  i'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
you think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
come on, sherm.  you're my cousin.  do this for me.  i'm begging you.
i can't do it, louis.  it isn't ethical.  i could lose my license.
why can't you just have them released? you're a doctor.
i'm a dermatologist.  i can't write orders on the psych ward.
sherman, i've done lots of favors for you.
like what?
i got you out of those bad tax shelters.
you were the one who got me in.
i fixed you up with diane troxler and she put out, didn't she?
yeah, i had to give her free dermabrasion for a year.  forget it, louis.  i could get in a lot of trouble.
i'm telling you, we're all going to be in big trouble if we don't do something fast. that ghost guy came and took my friend's baby and we got to get it back.  it's just a scared little baby, sherm.
then you should go to the police.  i don't believe in any of that stuff.
this is my cousin sherman.  sherm, say hello to the ghostbusters.  i promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  i know this sounds weird but once i had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but i knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
hey!  wait!  okay, i'll meet you there.
i thought you were like the fifth ghostbuster.
i let them handle all the little stuff.  i just come in on the big ones.
it looks like a giant jello mold.
i hate jello.
forget it.  the vienna boys choir couldn't get through this stuff.
good effort.  now what?  should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, ray?
it won't work.  there's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.
i can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. and there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you.  but there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned-out burg.  we just have to mobilize it.
we need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol --
something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us --
something good --
and pure --
and decent.
look, i've had it with you.  get your stuff together, get back in that clown car and get out of here.  this is a city matter and everything's under control.
oh, you think so?  well, i've got news for you.  you've got dracula's brother-in-law in there and he's got my girlfriend and her kid.  around about midnight tonight, when you're partying uptown, this guy's going to come to life and start doing amateur head transplants.  and that's just round one.
kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?
wonder what?
if she's naked under that toga.  she's french, you know.
i hope we have enough stuff to do the job.
only one way to find out.  ready, teddy?
i'm not sure this is such a good idea?  do they know you're doing this?
oh, yeah, sure -- no.  but there's really not much to do here and they might need some back-up at the museum.
you're very brave, louis.  good luck.
she's moving!
i've lived in new york all my life and i never visited the statue of liberty.  now i finally get here and we're taking her out for a walk.
how deep does it get?  that water's cold and i can't swim.
it's okay.  i have my senior lifesaving card.
i'll keep to the middle of the channel. we're okay to 59th street, then we'll go ashore and take first avenue to 79th.
are you kidding?  we'll hit all that bridge traffic at 59th.  i'm going to take 72nd straight up to fifth.  trust me, i used to drive a cab.
time is running out, dana.  soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and vigo's.  well, mainly vigo's.  but we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
we don't have a relationship.
i know.  marry me, dana, and together we will raise vigo as our son.  there are many perks that come with being the mother of a living god.  i'm sure he will supply for us a magnificent apartment.  and perhaps a car and free parking.
i hate and despise you and everything you stand for with all my heart and soul.  i could never forgive what you've done to me and my child.
many marriages begin with a certain amount of distance, but after a while i believe we could learn to love each other.  think about it.
i'd rather not.
it's working.  the positive gev's are climbing.
they love you, lib.  keep it up.
so far so good.
i'm worried.  the vibrations could shake her to pieces.  we should have padded her feet.
i don't think they make nikes in her size.
we're almost there, lib.  step on it.
my fault!
she's new in town.
you pitiful, miserable creatures!  you dare to challenge the power of darkness?  don't you realize what you are dealing with?  he's vigo!  you are like the buzzing of flies to him.
oh, johnny.  did you back the wrong horse.
vigi, vigi, vigi -- you have been a bad little monkey.
the whole city's together on this one.  we took a vote.  everybody's down on you, you know.
don't shoot!  you'll hit ray!
do it!  just do it!
ray -- ray -- how do you feel, man?
groovy.  i've never felt better in my life.
i think he likes you.  i think i do too.
finally came to your senses, huh?
late renaissance, i think.  caravaggio or brunelleschi.
there's something very familiar about this painting.
i think she looks pretty good here, don't you?
yeah, and a lot easier to get to than that island.
pretty impressive, huh?
it's probably the first thing my grandparents saw when they came to this country.
from where -- neptune?
they came from ostrov in eastern poland.
ostrov?  i've been there.  good party town.
my great-grandparents were swiss.  i still have the pictures they took of the statue from the boat when they arrived.
oh, right, you told me that.  they came to america seeking other kinds of cheese, as i recall.  how about you, winston?
my people weren't taking any pictures from those slave ships, man.  and there wasn't any statue in charleston harbor to welcome them, either.  what are you, dana?
miss blue blood?  her family's been here since the year 12.
that's not true.  it was 1620.
same difference.
what's your story, pete?
me?  i'm a little of everything.  some irish, some german, some french, dutch -- the women in my family slept around.  and that's what made this country great.
that's a terrible thing to say.
so what?  it's a free country.  thanks, lib.
