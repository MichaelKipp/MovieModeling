kasimov, kasimov, good that you called us.
i do not remember what happened!  we were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
c'mon, c'mon, tell the truth...c'mon.
they will kill me.
you asked for my help.  you asked for my help...come on...
you are right, of course.
come on!
his name is.....dimitri miediev.
dimitri miediev...dimitri miediev...
to friends.
yes, anatoly, yes.
did we get it?
we got it.  on your feet.
i want to sleep.  can i sleep here.
walk, just walk.  start walking.
I am walking.
talking's good, walking's better.
sleeping's better.
are you all right ethan.  what is wrong with you?
if you are going to do this again claire, it is not going to be on my watch.
oh yeah?
claire.
jack.
is there any particular reason we are not out of here yet?!
just waiting for you, tubs.
look to your right, then back to me. there is a camera built right into the bridge.  whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here.  can you hear me?
of course i can hear you.
no, in your...ear piece. you have a lovely smile . can you hear me now?
loud and clear.
what is going on?
i do not know.
why do not you take a look?
jack...that's spying.
that is what we do is not it?
jack you are so wicked.
too wicked to have a drink later?
i think i might just take that look.
yeah, well, jim, fact is I have got more than ninety days leave coming.
a hundred and sixty-seven, i think it is. take it all, if you want.  after this one.
i thought I would take some now.
what the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? claire's in a weird mood too.
oh?  what is the problem?
i do not know, i had to go to chicago again.  you were in kiev.  you tell me.
tell you what?
when you started noticing your short term memory loss.  what the problem was you and claire had in kiev?
what problem?
ah, god, forget it.  what are we talking burnout here?
i guess.
ethan, you can't burn out.
why not?
because i can not afford it. and because you would burn up before you would burn out.
how was chicago?
wonderful.  ran into a convention of auto dealers at the drake hotel.  you hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to mars after two years?  his wife's got a year old kid.  so he says "all right.  who was it?  my friend harry?"  she says no. "oh, it was my friend sammy."  she says it was not sammy.  "oh, i suppose it was my friend lou."  "no, what is the matter, do not you think i have any friends of my own?!"
you are going to use walter?
he is our guy.
is not he chairing the armed services hearing?
not this week. this week he is flyfishing at the oughterard slough in county kildare, with one of our best irish guides.
he will not be back in a hurry?
no, not in a hurry.  what do you think? you think the plot'll work?
sure.  if the main character does.
if you were me, ethan, who would you trust to make him believable?
sorry, am i interrupting?
always.
give me the god damn gum.
just do not chew it.
jack's pinned down sarah.  should be a second.  keep dancing.
we were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
higher.  higher.
higher.
right, right.  good.
jack.  jack.
i did not touch it.
ok.  taking golitsyn's exit.  jack, open the doors.
what about my coat?  I will freeze.
he is got it.  saved your ass again jack.
give me a break, pops.
such a nice ass.
and a lonely ass.
sarah's reconsidering.  claire, transport in five minutes.
roger that.
in position.  jack open the door, let the package roll.
roger that.  opening doors now.
stairway, youre wrapped, go to transport.
the package is in the open.
jim.  jim.  hes in the open.
ive got a shadow.
can you lose him?
no.  abort.
ethan.  hes out of pocket.
jim we cant.
abort.  thats an order.
negative, golitsyns on the move.
sarah eye on the package.  jim, im coming to you.
jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
no, were going to recover the disk, understand?!  now move!
where are you?
about two hundred yards from the bridge.
theyre covering this frequency, ethan. cut all radio communications.  repeat. cut all radio communications.
this is kittridge.
go secure.
go ahead.
theyre dead.
whos dead?
my team.  claire, jack, even jim - - hannah, maybe, i -- dont know
are you damaged?
they knew we were coming.  golitsyns dead too.  the disk is gone.
are you intact?
do you read me?  the list is in the open!
let's just bring you in safely, and then we will worry about that, okay?  were you followed?
i dont think so.
dont think, be sure.  are you clean?
yes.
location green.  one hour.  ill be there myself.
youre in prague?
heard a lot about you, hunt.  dont disappoint me.
no sir.
one hour.
i can not tell you how sorry i am.  i know how much jim in particular meant to you, ethan.  personally as well as professionally.
yeah.
passport, visas - you know the drill. we will work the exfiltration thru canada, debrief you at langley.  throw the prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects.  follow me?
yeah.  i follow you.
we have lost enough agents for one night.
you mean i've lost enough agents for one night.
you seem hell bent on blaming yourself, ethan.
who else is left?
yes.  i see your point.
why was there another team?
what?
of imf agents.  at the embassy.  tonight.
i do not quite follow you.
let's see if you can follow me around this room.  the drunk russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...the couple waltzing around me at the embassy at 9 and 11. the waiter behind hannah at the top of the staircase - bowtie, 12 o'clock. the other imf team.  you are worried about me. why?
you are right.  maybe this'll save some time.
for a little over two years now we have been spotting serious blowback in imf operations.  we have a penetration.  the other day we decoded a message on the internet from a czech we know as "max."
the arms dealer.
that is right.  max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. this time he is gotten to someone on the inside - he is put himself in a position to buy our noc list. an operation he referred to as "job 314".  the job he thought golitsyn was doing tonight.
but the list golitsyn stole was a decoy.
correct the actual list is safe at langley.  "golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.
this whole operation was a molehunt.
yes, the mole's deep inside. and -- like you said.  you survived.
since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter s and now, suddenly, they are flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in america after all, can be a very expensive proposition ethan.  so, why do not we go quietly out of here onto the plane...
how about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and i wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
ethan, i can understand you are very upset.
kitteridge, you have never seen me very upset.
ethan -- ethan, it is okay.  it is claire. ethan what is wrong with you?
do not move.
you were in the car!
i wasn't.  i heard that jim was in trouble on the radio.  he said someone was...
shut up!  i saw you.  you were in the car.
no, i got out of the car and i ran to the bridge.
do not give me that!  i was on the bridge.
what happened to jim?
there was nobody on the bridge.
what happened to jim?
they are dead.  jim's dead.
take off your coat.
what?
take off your god damn coat!
where were you?
i walked away.  he said abort.  he was gone so i walked away.
that was four hours ago!  who sent you? did they send you here?
who is "they?"
did they send you...did they send you?
who is they, who is they?
who sent you?!  who sent you?
no one sent me!  we are supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we do not return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four of the clock --!
why have not they brought us in yet?
I have been disavowed.  they think i killed jim and everyone else.  somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account.  kittridge assumes I am a mole they have been tracing and I have been in the employ of an arms dealer, max, for the last two years, to get him our noc list.
what are you going to do?
I am going to get it for him.  whoever the mole is, i think goes by the name of job, at least part of the time. 1 can not find him, but if he knows 1 have the noc list, he will find me.
ethan, you are not making sense. let me go in and talk to kittridge. I am going to tell him you had nothing to do...
claire, claire, claire, if you are not dead, he is going to assume you are with me.
the message is for job.
I am going to answer it.
would you remove your hat please?
why?
you wish to meet max?  this is the price of admission.
i thought i was going to see max.
you misunderstood.  no one sees max.
then what am i doing here?
allowing max to see you and hear what you have got to say.
i do not communicate very well through a shroud.
if max does not like what you have to say, you will be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
I am willing to take the chance.
very well.
who are you and what are you doing here?
i need one hundred thousand dollars.
really?  and you thought if you simply showed up i might give it to you?
why not?  you gave job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
the penny drops.  you are not job.  yes, job is not given to quoting scripture in his communications. and there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  job is not playful.  so you are something of a paradox.
that depends.
on what?
whether you like a paradox.  i want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
it is quite out of the question.
the disk job sold you is worthless.  it is bait, part of an internal molehunt.
and how might you know that?  are you another company man?
like job?
ah, but, we are asking about you.
I am noc.  was.  now disavowed.
why, may i ask?
that is the question i want to ask job.
i do not know job any more than he knows me.
even so, I am sure you could arrange an introduction.
why should i?
because i can deliver the actual noc list.  the one you have is not only worthless, it is certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
it is easy to say the disk is worthless when you say i can not look at the information and see if it is worthless. not a tenable position, sir.
okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty seconds to ten minutes you are going to have virginia farm boys hopping around you like jackrabbits.
mm - hmmm...
tell you what.  how good's the rf scanner you used in the car?
very good.
okay, use it.  but i suggest pack up first.
twenty-six, twenty-seven.  so far so good.
that is not so good for you, my friend.
thirty-two and change.
does not mean it is a signal.  could just be the hard drive heating up.
forty-four.  forty-five.
I would say you have got about two minutes.
thanks, max.  or is it maxine?
i do not have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  my deal with job was subject to a successful boot scan.  obviously it did not pass muster.  deal's off.
what was your deal with job?
six million dollars.  I will give you the same.  but i want the complete list now, not just eastern europe.  i will not do this piecemeal, it is too dangerous.  i want the entire list, the true name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.
ten million.  ten million in negotiable u.s. treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached.  and one more thing -- your personal assurance that job will be at the exchange.
done.  bring it to me in london.  i want it by the end of the week.
how will you make sure job will be there?
how will you make sure I will have the list in three days?  it is been a delight.  now where can i drop you dear boy?
I am not being dropped anywhere without my money.
I am going to have to front you personally.  do not lose that money without losing your life.
i would not dream of it.
the man's gone black, barnes.  he is under until he decides to surface.
look we can use someone from the embassy and we can get the local authorities involved. close off his transportation.
what can we do, barnes?  put a guy at the airport?  how many identities do you think hunt has?  how many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  these guys are trained to be ghosts.  we taught them how to do it, for christ's sake!
so what do you suggest?
let's not waste time chasing him.  make him come to us.  everybodys got pressure points.  find out something that is important to him personally and you squeeze.
max made a deal with you?
i deliver the noc list, max delivers job.
we have got seventy-five rounds for your glock 9, but only twenty for the sig sauer, one pair of visco glasses with monitor, plenty of passports. you said it yourself -- if I am not dead, I am with you.
you are sure about this?
jim was my husband. i want to know who killed him.  i want to get the son of a bitch who did this.
we need help, and we do not have time. they have to be local.
what kind of help?
simple game.  four players.  exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
bank?
imf mainframe.
where exactly is it?
in langley.
is he serious?
always.
if we are going to virginia, why do not we drop by fort knox?  i can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than breaking into the god damn cia.
what are we downloading?
information.
what kind?
profitable.
this does not sound like the luther stickell I have heard of.  what did they used to call you?  the net ranger?  phineas phreak?  the only man alive who actually hacked nato ghostcom.
there was never any physical evidence that i had anything to do with that.. that..  with that exceptional piece of work.
you do not know what you are missing. this is the mt. everest of hacks.
you are all kidding yourselves. even with top of the line crypto.  cray access. stu 3's --
krieger can get it.  right?
may take a little time.
may take a little time. that is not what claire tells me about you.
thinking machine laptops, I am talking about the 686 prototypes -- with the artificial intelligence risk chip --
and i get to keep the equipment when we are done.
luther, i guess you are all out of excuses.
i can not just hack my way inside.  there is no modem access to the mainframe, it is in a stand-alone.  I would have to be physically at the terminal.
luther, relax, it is worse than you think. the terminal's in black vault lock-down.
may i come in?
sure...
it is cash. and a second passport. if anything goes wrong when we are inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation do not look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? just walk away.
you do not think we are going to make it.
i did not say that.
you did not have to.........
i just need you to be safe.
what about you?
what about me - jim called an abort - i did not comply.  i lost the team. i just need you to be safe.
that is s.o.p..
s.o.p..
what sector's the air conditioning?
uh -- twenty-one, but there is no alarm in sector twenty-one.
i gotta go in there and shut it down!
nobody goes into any sector where the alarm did not go off.
do you want to blow the fire through the whole building?
wait!  hold it - it is on. let's go.
let's move!
zero body count.
we will see.
time up.
merci.
we are not outta here yet.
think, for christ's sake, you guys are mired in detail, open your minds, it is got to be staring us in the face!  what does ethan hunt want?!
same thing he wanted in prague!  same thing he is always wanted!  the noc list!
okay!
you and i know about this -- and that is where it stops.  understand?  it never happened.
what about him...?
you are not going to any meeting without me.
my contact is extremely shy.
i do not think you are in any position to give orders, do you?  not while I am holding this.
krieger.
stay out of this. or lachez - moi or t'agueue
that is not it.  that is not the list.
what is the matter, you do not know this trick?
I am so sorry.  krieger was my call.  I have never worked with him.  I am sorry, ethan.
we did what we had to do.
I am going to try and get some sleep.
krieger did have the noc list.
now i want you to hold onto it.
what makes you trust me?
because if you knew what you were getting into, you never would have done it.
I am not letting this list get out in the open.
exactly, that is your job.  tomorrow on the train, you can not let this list get out into the open.  what is the range of this thing?
it is hard to tell.  I am going to have to be close.
I will get you close.
kittridge...
bastard!
what are you going to do?
he is expecting my call.  I am going to the station...  and I am going to call him.
kittridge.
i see you have been out visiting the folks.
it is hunt.  what do you need for a pinpoint?  been watching a little t.v., have you?
can i ask you something, kittridge?
certainly ethan.
if you are dealing with someone who is crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own imf team, how devastated do you think you are going to make him by marching ma and uncle donald down to the county courthouse?
i do not know, ethan. suppose you tell me?
..the next day i managed to drag myself to the safe house, must have just missed you..anyway, i checked our aliases.
- and picked us up in the states -
- but you left before i could get there and i could check just so many places..
yeah, smaller countries do not computerize customs records -
- so i watched europe. once you showed up in england..it was easy.
you knew i liked the rentals at liverpool street.
hey, i showed 'em to you!
i remember..
jim, who do you think you are kidding?  a doctor's got to look at that.  you can not sit up straight.
i can sit up straight.  i just can't..sit up straight very well.  it is not important!  i saw who shot me.  ethan, i saw the mole.  it was kittridge.  <i>kittridge!</i>
kitteridge.  oh my god!  kittridge is the mole?
yeah.
how did kittridge do it?..
..when you think about it, ethan, it was inevitable..no more cold war.  no more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  then one morning you wake up and find out the president of the united states is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  the son-of-a- bitch!  how <i>dare</i> he?  you realize its over, youre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  kittridge, well go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
we dont have to, jim.  hell come after us.
whats going to make him do that?
what he didnt get in prague.  the noc list.
jesus, ethan.  good for you.
a meeting tomorrow on the tgv, enroute to paris.
tight security.  no guns.  real plus.
if i supposedly deliver the noc list to max, max has agreed to deliver job to me. ill have claire and luther stickell with me on the train.  marcel krieger will have helicopter transport waiting in paris.
jim...?
i was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking im dead and gone.  god knows what shes had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, i..
- no.  she cant know about me.  no one can.  not til this is over.  theres too much at stake, ethan.
youre probably right.
i usually am.
once we leave the safehouse, get in there and crash.  ill call you from paris.
you got it.
and get a doctor.
good luck.
what happened?
i sent the message to max.  were on for tomorrow.
okay...
is this the only way?
yes.......come here....viens pres moi...
how long until we reach the chunnel?
twenty minutes.
yes...  its him.
this wasnt what we discussed.
ha, dear boy!  i do hope this doesnt prelude a meeting in private.
it doesnt, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
the possibility alone is worth ten million.  baggage car, rack 3.  silver briefcase.  combination 314.
what about job?
i wouldnt worry about him.  once youve got the money -- hell find you.
only four more cars.
and if we dont find him - well search the whole train again.
whats hunt doing on the tgv?
high speed train.  no-one gets on.  no- one gets off.  high security.  good place for a pass off to max.
but why tell us?
hes putting on a show, barnes.
what kind of show.
i dont know.  it didnt say on the tickets.
ethan...kittridge is on the train.
kittridge is job.  max delivered.  how far is he from luther?
two cars.  where are you?
you are my eyes.  stay with him.
whats the problem.
connection denied.
try it again.
its not working.
is something wrong with the phone?  well is something wrong with the batteries?
i always check the batteries.
run it through from the top.
nothing but civilians, gene.
this is bullshit - we dont even know what max looks like.
maybe we dont have to know what he looks like.  if hes got that list, hes going to want to check it.  we should be looking for laptops.
good idea.
its working.
phew!  weve got five minutes...
ethans right behind me.  listen to me jim.  is it such a good idea to kill him? we take the money.  ethan takes the blame.  no-one else has seen you alive. no-one will believe him.
of course - im sorry to hear you say that claire.
ethan?
you knew about jim?
course he did.  just exactly when he knew is something of a question.  before or after i showed in london, mind telling me, ethan?
before london.  but after you took the bible out of the drake hotel in chicago.
they stamped it, didnt they?  those damn gideons.
two minutes til krieger shows.  thisll have to be quicker than id like. certainly quicker than youd like.
ethan, if you knew about jim?..why..
why the masquerade?  why take the risk? well, claire, youve asked the question and you are the answer.
i knew about jim.
but, he didnt know about you.  in all fairness, ethan, claire was never convinced her charms would work with you. but i was supremely confident - having tastes the goods.  "thou shall not covet thy neighbours wife", ethan.  oh, ethan is in love with you, claire, make no mistake about it.  and like all the worlds lovers, hes tortured by the same, one pathetic question - "does she feel the same way i do?"
well claire do you?  have you been exploiting his feelings or returning them?
jim - lets just get the money and get out of here.
tell me something claire, that night in prague, was it you or jim that blew up the car and scattered hannah all over town?
keep counting claire.
satisfied?
all ten million.
fold it.  fold it tight.
arent you going to thank me jim.  ten million is better than six.
dont flatter yourself - six was for eastern europe.  you made a lousy deal - ten for the world?  what is that?  but i needed you for the transfer with max.  i got a little extra change;  and you got a little extra too.
sorry ethan.  times up.  say goodbye.
youre wrong about one thing.  im not the only one whos seen you alive.
dont jim.
now we dont have to eliminate him?  you like that, dont you claire?  dont you?
yes.
jim, its over.
ethan - ive always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  it can kill you.
claire...hey...
this stuff is so sticky.
claire.
its all right, ethan..youll bring me back...wont you...
i always have, claire..
reach your folks?  how they feeling?
about what?
the official apology from the justice department, the vip treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
well my mother was a little confused about how the dea could mistake her and uncle donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the florida keys.
here's to  you, luther.   to being off the disavowed list.
hey, I am the flavour of the month!
you are more than that, luther.  they were mistaken about you and they are trying to show you they know it.  they want you back in.
sure.  they want me back in so i will not break in!  they <i>still</i> can not figure out how we did it.
you did not tell 'em at the debriefing?
i figured I would let 'em reinstate my back pay, give me a promotion, check out my office at langley and <i>then</i>, maybe, talk about it.
it is all one big negotiation, is not it?
why do not you come back with me?
just do not know why I would be doing it.
you really liked phelps, did not you?
he was a good guy for a long, long time. just - not long enough.  got to catch my flight.. so.  how is it feel being a solid citizen again?
oh man...i do not know.  I am going to miss being disreputable.
well, luther - if it makes you feel any better I will always think of you that way.
