I am sorry...  but...
two weeks work gone for nothing.
i just wanted to tell you...
i do not care what you wanted to tell me.  you are through!  get your things and get out!
how are you?
another young man.
it is the same one.
it is been the same one for three months.
forgive me.  how are you?
take a good look at him, dad.  now please try to remember him... 'cause he is going to be your son- in-law.
well!
that is, if it is all right with you.
and if it isn't?
he will still be your son-in-law!
you see how much we have to say.
dad, this is what i really wanted to ask you....
mind if i look around?
help yourself.  oh, tom, show this gentleman...
where are you going?
home!
home?
I am fired.
who fired you?
you did.
mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
yes, she would.
i hate all that fuss.  but I will do it on one condition -- that you are there to give me away.
what would your mother say to that?
this is my wedding.
would not it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
he can stay home.  please, dad, will not you?
if you think it will be all right.
wait a minute.  when is it going to be? I am leaving town tonight.
where are you going?
it is a secret.  i can not even tell you, my dear.  I have got an important idea to work on.
a new invention?
yes.  and i do not want anybody to steal it from me.
we were planning to be married right after christmas.
oh, I will be back before christmas.
it is a promise?
that is one thing i will not forget.  where is macaulay?  i ought to be starting.
how is your brother?
he is all right.
I would like to see him.  why do not you bring him down?
you know how it is, dad.  he is sort of under mother's thumb.
i know -- i know --
you are not missing much.  he is cuckoo.
like all the rest of us.  has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
and he still wants to marry me!
he is a brave man.
i did not know you invented that smelting process.
look -- those are the first metals that came through.
poor dad, does that still bother you?
only in bad weather.
but it is not bad weather now.
better get home before it is.
goodbye, darling.  do not you dare forget...  december 30th.
goodbye, my boy.  take care of dorothy.  show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
all settled?  grand!  why did your mother ever divorce him?  he is swell.
wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
oh.  I will do my own typing!
how are you?  here.  get under this.
thanks...  we are taking your cab.
is your father still in there?
he is waiting for you.
did he tell you where he was going?
he would not say.
tch-tch-tch --  well, goodbye, miss wynant.  you would not drive slowly, so you do not get a tip.
did you get my money?
i do wish you would tell me where you are going.
I am not telling anyone.
but suppose some business comes up...
that is just why I am going.
one hundred...  two hundred... three...
never mind.
i wish you would count them.  there is a thousand dollars there.
i trust you.
is not there anything else i can do for you? have you bought your ticket?
no.
well, let me do that for you.
you might do that.  get me a ticket for...  no, you don't!
thanks, and goodbye.
what will i do if something comes up?
settle it yourself.  what have i got a lawyer for?
is julia going with you?
no.
but what if you need more money?
i left instructions with julia. she will get it from you.  goodbye.
well, congratulations.
I am going to give her a wedding present.  thought I would better do it now, before i forget it.  i can drop them on my way to...  that is funny....  where are those bonds?
bonds, sir?
i know i left them there.
maybe miss wolf has them.
maybe she has.
you are forgetting the check for your suitcase.  it is at the grand central.
oh, yes -- yes -- that is right --
we are just having a little drink.
so i see.
who is that man?
he is not anybody.  just a fellow i used to know.
i thought you would given up that sort of friend.
this is the first time I have seen him in years.  i did not want him to think i was high-hatting him.
i do not like him.
do not worry.  you will not see him again.  what happened? did you change your mind about going?
no.  i just came back for a second. i wanted to get those bonds.
what bonds?
the government bonds.  the ones you took from the office safe.
oh yes.  why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
I would never tell you to sell those. i bought them for my daughter.
do not you remember....
now see here, julia.  you are counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  you have been taking a little here and there for some time, and i have not said anything about it.  but this is fifty thousand dollars!
do you realize that you are accusing me of ....
no one else had the combination of that safe.  you took them.  what did you do with them?
what if i did take them? I am sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
that is my business.
supporting that gang of loafers! there is not one of them that cares a damn for you.  a wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  they would not raise a hand to help you.  and I have given my whole life for you.  if you kicked off tomorrow, where did i be? out in the gutter!  sure i took those bonds.  who has a better right -- ?
i want that money right now, or I will hand you over to the police.
go ahead!
they will be pretty rough with you....with your record.
that is a fine thing to throw up to me after all I have been to you....
hello ....  give me ....  well ....  ?
I will give it back to you ....  all I have got ....twenty-five thousand...
you are going to return every cent of it!
i can't! i have not got it!
what did you do with the rest?
i never had it.
then someone was in with you.  who was it? -- who was it?  I will answer that --  hello ...  hello ...
cheer up, darling.
I am sorry.
what is the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
it is all right.
darling, your father's all right. he will turn up in time.
but tonight is christmas eve!
he is just forgotten.  you know he forgets everything.
he is never forgotten a promise to me.  I am worried about him.  i know something is happened to him.
what could happen to him, darling? you must not worry....  what is it?
just a minute...
another martini --
hello, there!
you know, we know each other.
of course we do! we have been friends for years.
are not you nick charles?
yes.
you do not remember me.....  I am dorothy wynant.
not that scrawny little....?
yes.
how did you ever remember me?
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  you used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  were they true?
probably not.
andy...  this is nick charles.  he worked on a case for father.
yes.  some nut who wanted to kill him.  how is your father?
that is what i was going to ask you.  he is disappeared!
disappeared!
now do not say that -- he is just off somewhere working.
i can not find him.  I have tried everything.  i thought you might know.
i do not know anything -- I have been in california for four years. what about his lawyer? used to be a guy named mac-- something.
macaulay.
that is it...  herbert macaulay.
tried him once -
why do not you try him again?
she is got me worrying, too.
do not start worrying about him. he is a good guy, but screwy.
why did that man want to kill him?
said he stole his invention.
do you suppose.....  ?
what?
nothing.
you better take a drink.
so it is you he was after!
hello, baby.
he is dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
i had him out this morning.
i thought so.  he even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
oh, this is andy --
you might have mentioned me first.
he is well-trained.  he will behave himself.
as long as there is not a fire hydrant.  what I have gone through --
any luck?
he is just around the corner.
your father?
no.  the lawyer -- I am going to see him.
how do you do?  I am sorry we have to rush.
we are at the normandie for a couple of weeks.  why do not you drop around?
thanks.  we will.  goodbye.
pretty girl.
if you like 'em like that.
you got types?
only you, darling...  lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
who is she?
i was hoping i would not have to tell you.  dorothy is really my daughter.  you see, it was spring in venice, and i was so young.  i did not know what i was doing.  we were all like that on my father's side.
by the way, how is your father's side?
much better, thanks.
how many drinks have you had?
six martinis.
six martinis.  you are not going to have anything on me.
what hit me?
that last martini.
i can not lie here.  I have got to get up and trim that darned christmas tree.
take it easy.
who is that?
santa claus.
how are you?
hello, macaulay.  come in.
dorothy told me you were here.  i was going to telephone but....
that is all right.  what are you drinking?
nothing, thank you.  nothing.  i wanted to see you...  what is mimi up to, charles?
mimi?  ...  oh, dorothy's mother.  does she have to be up to something?
she usually is.  trying one way or another to get money out of wynant. i wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
i have not been a detective for four years.
you do not say --
my wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things.  and I am looking after them.
i see.  i see.
what is all the fuss about? is he in hiding?
you know as much about it as i do. i have not seen him in three months.
no word at all?
he sends word through julia wolf when he wants money...  i give it to her and she gives it to him.
is there a mr. macaulay in the house?  oh, it is you.
yes?
my wife.
how do you do?  what did you say?....  he is?.... where is he?  very well.  he is back in town....  wynant.  thank heaven.  he is waiting for me now.  forgive me, mrs. charles...  but I have been so upset.  it is no joke working for a man like that.  i must be off.  goodbye....  goodbye,
s'long.
how are you?....  oh, I am mrs. jorgensen now....  no, she is not here.  is it about her father?  well, can i take the message?
give it to me.
oh, here she is.
i just wanted to relieve your mind. your father's alive and all right.
oh, thank heaven.
what is it? has he found him?
do you know where he is living?  oh....  well, at least I am glad he is all right.  thank you for calling. goodbye.
what is it?
nothing.
that is not true.  it was about your father.  where is he?
he is all right.  is not that enough?
no.
you just want money -- and you have not any right to any more.  he made a big settlement on you.
that is gone long ago.  I have got to see him.  where is he?
i will not have you hounding him any more for money.
what is it, gilbert? tell mother! what did he say?
he said that father's in town. he is been seeing julia right along.
that woman!
she could tell you where father is.
mother ....  you could not do that. you could not go to her.
i did not say i would.  but we have got to have money.
did it ever occur to you that chris might work?
shush!
do not mind what she says, chris.
how can i help but mind? I am constantly humiliated...  just because i have not money.
I will get some.
you have said that for weeks.
i know.
why do not you go to see julia? she handles his money.
chris!
all right.  all right.
i could not go near that woman.
i said all right!
what are you going to do?
just what i said I would do.
you would not do that...  you wouldn't!
would not i.  just watch me.
chris -- chris -- !
when was the last time you gave her money for wynant?
yesterday.  i gave her a thousand dollars.
seen any signs of it, bill?
i said he had not written me.
oh, then you did hear from him?
well....
well, what?
he telephoned me today.
he did!
i was not in.  my secretary took the message.  he left word for me to meet him at the plaza.
when was that?
about three.
did you go?
yes.  but he did not show up.
i know he will turn up as soon as he sees this in the papers.  you can not think he had anything to do with it, mr. guild.  he was not the kind of man that....
do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
i did not know they had a fight.
well, thanks.  we will call you when we need you again.
and there she was lying dead.  the police said she would probably been killed about ten minutes before i got there.
i thought you said you were not going there.
why, you said...
never mind.
did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?
not a thing.
was there much blood?
don't.  it is horrible.
nonsense! she got at she deserved.
did you kill her?
gilbert!
why not? you had a perfectly good motive.
i hope you will not talk that way to the police when they come here.
well, I have got my alibi.  i was at the public library.  where were you?
children, will you go into the next room? i want to talk to chris alone.
there are a few things we want to check up on.
i see.
you say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
why yes.
did you see anything in miss wolfe's hand?
no.
are you sure you did not leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
i do not think so.  of course i was terribly upset...  i hardly knew what i was doing.
the medical examiner seems to think that the body was touched.  he says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....
that is all right.  well, we will be going.
goodbye.
goodbye.
you took that money from julia's hand.
i didn't.
then what are you hiding?
it is a piece of evidence that is worth a great deal more than that.
you hand that over to the police.
I will do nothing of the sort.
all right, then.  I will tell them.
i do not think you will.  it is your father's.
i do not believe it! you are lying!
there!
oh!
now do you believe me!
nick charles here?
yes.  nick!
you his wife?
yes.
he is a good guy.  he sent me up the river once.  hey, nick!
was he a good detective?
i would not know.  that time he caught me was a accident.  i led with my right.
sorry.  i do not know anything about it.
come on, gimme a break.
i never tried to kid you reporters -- I am telling you the truth.
come on -- relax --  give them a drink.
we need ice.
I would better order some food.  that sounds like an interesting case.  would not you like to take it?
i have not the time.  I am much too busy seeing that you do not lose any of the money i married you for.
room service, please -
sounds like a good case.  girl mysteriously murdered.  no one knows who did it.  they have not found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
i wonder if they have --  i do not want to hear anything about it.
is not that my drink?
what are you drinking?
rye.
come on in.
I have got to see you alone!
you heard about julia wolf?
yes.
there.
what are you trying to tell me? that you did it?
yes.  i hated her for coming between my mother and father.  she kept me from seeing my father.  i went down there to ask her where he was.  she would not tell me, and i shot her.
where did you hit her?
why... in the heart.
pretty good shot you are. what did she do?
she fell down.
did she make any sound?  did not scream?
i do not know.
which way did she fall?
she... she fell over backwards.
oh, yeah?  people fall toward a shot, you know...  not back from it.  i knew you were lying.
where did you get this gun?
i bought it in a pawn shop.
do not lie to me.
that is the truth.
where did you get that?
she brought it in.  trying to make me believe she did it.
what are you going to do with it?
nothing, 'til i find out if it is the gun julia wolf was killed with.  keep her in here, and do not let those reporters see her. they might believe her.
oh, nick... nick!
hello, mimi.
want to talk to you about something very important.
clyde wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. no wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
what do you think?
oh, i know he didn't, but i wish i could find him...  i have something very important to tell him. macaulay will not help at all.  he thinks i just want money.
well, do not you?
you are always teasing.
nick, you will help me find clyde -- will not you?
now, mimi, there are a thousand detectives in new york.  hire one of them.
but he knows you.  all you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that mimi says everything is all right... but that I have got to see him.
i tell you again, i do not want any part of it.  now you take dorothy home and...
dorothy!  is she here?
yes...
she did not tell me a thing.
too bad you did not bring your whip.
where is gilbert?
gilbert!  is he here too?  we might as well be living in the lobby.
there is a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with julia wolf that the police have overlooked.  and i think it explains everything.  you see, my father was a sexogenarian.
he was?
yes.  he admitted it.
sexogerarian, eh?  yes.  yes.  but i can not put that in the paper.
why not?
you know how they are... sex...
then just say he was sixty years old.
is that what it means?
of course.
nick!  nick!  are you asleep?
yes.
good. i want to talk to you.
that is jolly.
do not you think you would like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
can not you get to sleep?
no.
maybe a drink would help you.
no thanks.
maybe it would if i took it.
everybody says you were a grand detective.
they were kidding you.
I would like to see you work.
tomorrow I will buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
that poor girl is in a tough spot.
there is nothing i can do to help her.
she thinks you can. it would not hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
darling, my guess is that wynant killed julia and dorothy knows it. and the police'll catch him without my help.
i think i would like that drink.  I will give you your christmas present now if you will give me mine.
at breakfast.
but it is christmas now.
breakfast.
what are you going to give me?  i hope i do not like it.
you will have to keep them anyway. the man at the aquarium said that he would not take them back.
nick!  nick!  there is someone to she you,
that is great.  i was afraid I would have to go to sleep.
i gotta talk to you.  i want you to tell me something and i want you to give it to me straight. get me?
do you mind putting that gun away? my wife does not care, but I am in a delicate condition.
you idiot!  asta! stop that!  get down!  now, stay there.
all right... shoot!  i mean... what is on your mind?
I have never heard about you.
i did not knock julia off.
all right - you didn't.
i have not seen her in three months. we were all washed up.
why tell me?
i would not have any reason to hurt her.  she was always on the up and up with me.  but that dirty little nunheim -- he got sore cause i clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
that is all swell.  only you are peddling your fish in the wrong market. I have got nothing to do with it.
listen.  "studsy" burke told me you used to be o.k. that is why I am here. do  they....
how is studsy?  i did not know he was out of stir.
he is all right. he would like to see you. but listen...  what is the law doing to me?  do they think i did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
I would tell you if i knew. but I am not in this.  ask the police.
that would be very smart.  that would be the smartest thing i ever did. me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument.  the boys would like to have me come in and ask questions.  they would like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. now i come to you on the level. studsy says you are on the level. be on the level.
i am on the level. if i knew anything i'd....
what is that?
this is your party.
it is all right.  it just grazed me.
someone get a doctor.
there is one coming.
well, quick -- get into bed.  are you all right?
sure -- i do not even feel it.
I will get some towels.
I will be all right. do not let's fuss till the doctor comes.
want a drink?
yeah.
how did you people happen to pop in?
we hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the wynant family, so we figure we will stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  and pretty lucky for you.
yes.  i might not have been shot.
we were looking for this bird.
i never saw him before.
what is he want of you?
wanted to tell me he did not kill julia wolf.
what is that to you?
nothing.
what did he think it was to you?
ask him.  i do not know.
I am asking you.
keep on asking.
not without a warrant.
so you say -  go on, bob.
have you got a pistol permit?
no.
ever heard of the sullivan act?
this gun yours?
no.
who is is it?
I will have to try to remember.
okay.  there is plenty of time. i guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on. we will come up tomorrow when you are feeling better.  come on.
i wish that doctor'd come.  how do you feel?
he will be here.  give him time to get his trousers on.  where is asta?  asta!  asta!
you are a fine watch dog.
he is got more sense than you have. thank heaven you are not on this case.
on it!  I am in it ... they think i did it!
well, did not you?
i never saw that before.
no.  it is a christmas present.
who gave it to you?
you did.
you must admit i have good taste.
finished with these?
yes.  i know all they know about the murder. and I am a great hero. the tribune said i was shot twice.
i read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
that is not true.  he never came near my tabloids.  that is one thing i always protect... my tabloids.
hello... send him up.
who is that?
macaulay.
are not you hot in that?
I am stifling, but it is so pretty.  the kirbys.
is that another christmas present?
yes.
did i give it to you?
yes.
nick, listen.  from clyde wynant!  "will you take charge of investigation on julia wolf murder. communicate with herbert macaulay".
let's see.  where is it from?
philadelphia.  then he did not do it, did he, nick?
i do not know.
he would not ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
your guess is as good as mine.
oh take it!  please take it!
oh, hello.  come on in.
good morning. I am afraid this is not a very "merry christmas" for you.
oh, he is sitting up.
good.
how are you?
i hate to bother you when you are laid up.
that is all right.
asta - do not bother mr. macaulay.
that is all right.
oh, it is a fire hydrant.
yes.  it is asta's christmas present.
i got word from wynant this morning...
so did we.  i mean, sherlock here.
what are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?
slim.
oh, please, nick.
would it help any if i could persuade him to meet you?
it might.
he gave me a code message to insert in the times, in case i wanted to get in touch with him.
it would not hurt to put it in.
I have done that already. he should appear, you know.  it does not look well... his staying away at a time like this.
hello.... oh, just a minute.  police department?
hello....  where?  in allentown.  yes... when is the next train? right - I will get that.  wynant's tried to commit suicide. they want me to come down and identify him.  i guess this changes the whole story, does not it?  that looks like an admission of guilt.  and i had such hopes.  i thought if you got on the case, you would be able to clear him.  i thought that mimi.... the way she acted... i was sure that....  oh, well, well... it is no use thinking of it now.  I am sorry to have wasted so much of your time.
well, that is that.  stay there, nick!
it is not going to hurt me to get up.
sit down!
you talk as if i were asta.
all right, hard guy.  get up and bleed on the rugs.
what is the trouble, asta?  your balloon busted?  so's mine.
what is the matter with you?
the mystery's all gone. and i wanted you to find out who did it.
maybe i will.
but wynant --- ?
i do not believe he did it.
why do not you?
no reason.  just a hunch.  but I am going to find out.  I am tired of being pushed around.
so am i.
come on, watson, we are going places.
good morning --
good morning, lieutenant -  sorry.
you ought not to play this trick on me.  running out when i was giving you time to rest up before i asked you those questions.
you mean about that gun?
that am not a gun any more.  the firing pin's busted - the -  do not waste time talking about that.
man to man, mr. charles, are you working on this case?
man to man, I am not.
but he is interested!
i do not mind telling you I would rather have you working with us than against us.
so would i.
it is a bargain then.  anything you want to know?
what about the suicide?
oh, that is a phoney.  the men did not even have to go down.
i thought it might be.  from now on, they are going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is wynant.
do you think that wynant did it?
looks like he planned, something. he shut up his apartment and his shop.
you have been there?
yeah. could not find a thing. this is the way we figure it.  wynant goes to julia's apartment. he finds morelli there... sees she is two- timing him.  they have a fight. but he figures he do not want to do anything then.... morelli might squeal.  so he goes away. he do not let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to julia to give to him, so that julia will think it is all blown over. then, when she do not expect it... he lets her have it.
no proof?
nothing yet to cinch it.
fifty will get you a hundred that he did not do it.
what do you mean?
for one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
who is your candidate?
i have not got that far yet.  but i do not think that everything points to wynant.  what about the alibis?
they are all o.k.  mrs. jorgensen, the boy, dorothy, macaulay... even morelli... we had to let him go.
what about jorgensen?
I will check on that.  I am afraid this is kinder dull for you.
what about this nunheim?
oh, he is all right.  we know all about him.  he does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
did you know he was hanging around julia?
no.
he is holding out on you.
let's go and see.  taxi!
this may be a little rough - you would better let us go alone.
catch me letting you go alone!
have a shot?
what is the idea of telling me you just knew the wolfe girl by sight?
that is all i did, lieutenant. that is the god's truth.  maybe i said hello to her or how are you or something like that when i saw her, but that is all i knew her. that is the truth.  all right.  put your mouth in and I will pop a tooth out of it.
she drives me nuts.  she is been ragging me all day.
maybe if you quit running around after other women you would not have so much trouble with this one.
that is a lie, lieutenant...  anybody that says that is a liar.
want to take a poke at him?
i did not mean you, mister.
you would done better to have told me that in the beginning.  where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
you do not think i had anything to do with it?
where were you?
where were you?
marian!  marian! do not go! I will behave!  I will do anything!  do not go, marian!
let me go!  let me bring her back. i can not get along without her. I will bring her right back and I will tell you anything you want to know. let me go!
sit down!  we did not come here to watch you and that broad dance around a may pole.  where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
i can not remember offhand, lieutenant.  maybe i was over at charlie's shooting pool. maybe i was here.  she would remember.
how did you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
just give me a minute....  I will remember. I am not stalling, lieutenant.  you know i always come clean with you.  gee, it would serve me right if you had pinched me...  that is the afternoon i was.... wait, I will show you...!
well, what did you think?
i think we are on the right track.
who are you calling?
I am calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. i want to see where he goes.
trail him!  trail who?
nunheim!
chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- i do not see that it is important --
you should have told them he would disappeared.
but he has nothing to do with it!
that is not for you to decide. everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this --  the police will want his description.  is this a picture of him?
i tell you -- he did not do it.
they will want more than your word for that.
all right, then -- I will tell them who did do it!
mother!
and I will give then proof!
oh, andy.
do not cry.
i can not help it.  you do not know.....
darling, you can not go through any more of this.  now you get together your clothes and your skates and we will go out to my family's in the country.
i can't.
you have got to get your mind off this.
you are sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
go!
and do not ever try to see me again.
what are you talking about?
please!  you can not get mixed up in this.
do you think i care
you do not understand.  you do not know what is going to happen.
i only know i want to marry you... right now, and --
i can not marry you!  i can not ever marry you!
dorothy!
how would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  it would be fun, would not it?  maybe they would murder each other...  keep it all in the family. that is what father should have done.  he should have killed me and gilbert... then we would not have had this to go through.
you are talking like a crazy person,
why not? i am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
dorothy.... listen to me. i love you.  do not you understand that? i love you.
go away!
get anything?
she is ready to talk.  it will not do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
i guess that cinches it, eh, mr. charles?  he killed them both - julia wolf and nunheim.
fifty will still get you a hundred.
this is enough for me.
i wish they would stop that.  it makes me fidgety. do you think they will find him, nick?  he must be in new york....  where do you think you are going?
I am going to take asta for a walk.
he is just been for a walk.
we are going sightseeing -- are not we, asta?
what is that?  what are you up to?  nickie - what is this?
looks like a hold-up!
what are you going to do?
I have got hunch.  I am going down to look at wynant's shop, i want to find out why it is closed.
why should not be close it? he went away.
he went away lots of times when i knew him - but he never closed his shop. I have got a hunch something is up.
you mean, he might be hiding there?
i do not know...  this thing has got my goat. I have got to find out.
nick - i will not have you going down there.
say you are the one who got me in this!
i know but this is different. he is a crazy man. he might kill you.
I will be all right.  I have got asta to protect me.
go on - go on - see if i care. but it is a dirty trick bringing me all the way to new york just to make me a widow.
you would not be a widow long.
you bet i wouldn't.
not with all your money!
you dog!
goodbye, darling.
nickie, take care of yourself will not you?
sure i will.
do not say it that way. say it as if you meant it.
why, i believe the little woman cares.
i do not care - I am just used to you, that is all --  if you let anything happen to him, you will never wag that tail again!
come on out, now.  he will not hurt you.  back to your old tricks, eh, tanner?
no, mr. charles.
how did you get in here?
i had a key. i worked here... till they closed the shop.
you worked here?
yes, sir.  julia wolf got me a job as bookkeeper.
well, that is a hot one.  you a bookkeeper!  when were you ever a bookkeeper?
that time you sent me up last ... i learned book-keeping at sing sing.  i figured it might be an in for me somewhere's.
somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
honest, mr, charles.  i never touched that safe.  them bonds that were missing... julia took them.
trying to put it off on her?
mr. charles - she did - that is why he got sore at her and killed her. listen, mr. charles --  i did do a little chiseling.  i come to bring it back and fix up the books.  i did not want him to find out and come after me -
you can save that and tell it to the police.  they will be here in a minute.
police!
just rolled them up and threw them in.
lucky thing for us they were not in that lime.
extraordinarily lucky.
"d.w.r."  that case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill wynant... what what was his name?
rosebreen.
could this be him?
i never saw him.  i do not think anyone saw him.
he said wynant tried to steal an invention.
yes.  but we figured it was just blackmail...
just the same, wynant would not mind having him out of the way, would he?  how long should you say this body'd been here, doc?
you can take that out to the car.
going to run him through the fluoroscope?
yes.
do you mind if i come down and see it?
not at all.
I am very interested in that body.
what are you doing here?
I will take care of him.
shrapnel!
must have been in the war.  that might account for the cane and his limp.
yes... yes.
have the police got any idea where wynant is?
no.
what about this rosebreen?
sorry.  do not know a thing.
what is your next step, nick?
right back to california.  we have got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
we will see you before you go.
back to california
my soul, woman.  i give you three murders and you are not satisfied.
i want you to stay and find wynant.
i did find him!
what do you mean?
he was down in the shop.
nick!
it was his body that was buried there.
nick, you would better lay off that liquor.
that is a fact.
wynant's body?
yup.  do not you want something to eat?
but they all said it was rosebreen's.
that is what they think... guild and all of them.  they take it for granted that it is just another of wynant's victims.  guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for wynant. that is all that troubles him.
what makes you so sure it is wynant's body?
several things.  hello, fred.  we are hungry again. yeah, and lots of onions.  oh, and coffee.
nick, you will drive me crazy.  what things?
huh?
what things made you so sure?
oh.  well, the clothes for instance. they were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  the person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
well, do not they?
sure.
you do not get another swallow 'til you really open up.
i remembered that wynant had some shrapnel in his shin.  it often bothered him.  so i looked for it and i found it.  gimme.
how long has he been dead?
couple of months anyway.
then he could not have committed those other murders.
smart gal.
wynant dead?  does dorothy know?
no.  nobody but you.
I am going to tell her.
hey... hey.  do not do that.
but the poor kid's going crazy. she would rather know her father was dead than that...
i can not help it. i can not tell a soul.  i did not even tell guild.
why not?
i want to lie low till i get the whole dope.  i do not want to go off half-cocked.
what are you going to do?
I am going to get the real murderer. I have got an idea.  want to see me take him?
yes!
got a nice evening dress?
now nick, what is that got to do with it?
got a nice evening dress?
I have got a lulu -- why?
I am going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
the suspects!  they will not come.
oh, they will come.  I will have guild issue the invitations.
who do you think did it?
mimi...
mimi!
mimi, jorgensen, morelli, tanner.....
hello, dorothy.
hello, nick!  and a party - celebrating father's third murder -
this is a pretty dead bunch, is not it?
you are high enough.
why not?
i think we may as well sit down.
i guess all the suspects are here.
mr. guild means guests!  oh, there are two more to come.
they will be here.  do not worry.  my men are picking them up.
you are a great help to a hostess. i wish i always had you for my dinner parties.
you give such charming parties, mr. charles.
thank you, mrs. charles.
i can not wait any longer.  tell me, do you think one of them did it?
yes.
i wish you would tell me who.
i wish you would tell me.
this is all very pleasant but why are here?
I have got some very important news - I have seen wynant.
you did!
that is nothing.  i saw him myself.
you did... where?
last night.  he came to see me at my apartment.
oh, did he?  what did he say?
he did not say very much.  wanted to know how i was and how the children were.
what kind of clothes was he wearing?
a brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
tell 'em.
i saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
what are you talking about, gilbert? you were not there!
know.  but i saw him -
serve the nuts - i mean, serve the guests the nuts.
I am afraid you are lying, mimi. you see, i really did see wynant last night.
are you kidding?
no.
why did not you tell me? .... why did not you hold him?
because i found out for certain that he did not commit the murders.
he did not do it -- nick!
what do you mean?
that is ridiculous.
let him have his say out.
morelli -  you knew julia.  was she gypping wynant?
she do not say she is, but i figure she is -
why do you say that?
once i wanted five grand --  cash -
thank you.  now I will tell you why i know wynant did not commit those murders -  three months ago - the night that he caught you in julia's apartment, he found out that julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man.  he went to find the man. that man was.... tanner, do not you...?
I am sorry.  tanner, do not you want some wine?
no... no.
you are going to drive me crazy!
let's see... where was i?  oh, yes.  he went to find the man. that man was desperate!  he knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. he killed wynant.  it is terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, dorothy.
dead?
he is been dead for three months.
darling, do not cry.  please.  i know it is terrible.  but is not it really better this way?
oh, andy, andy!
because i do not believe that clyde's dead!  why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
so i did.  i saw him lying buried in his shop.
you mean that body-----?
--was wynant's.
perfectly absurd.
and the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he is sitting at this table.  you may serve the fish.
what am i?  the fall guy?
i hope you will not let this news spoil your dinner.  nice food, is not it?
if that knife is missing, I will look for it in your back.
after our hero had killed wynant, he got a brilliant idea.  he realized that he and julia could still collect money.  wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to macaulay, signing wynant's name, so that macaulay would continue to send the money to julia.  he even telephoned macaulay --  do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
but it must have been wynant.  i should have known if it were not his voice.
oh he as clever about that.  he called when you were out.  that same afternoon, julia telephoned to him. she said that you were coming, mimi, to ask about wynant. he got terrified. he was afraid that julia would break down and tell... so he went to julia and killed her and left wynant's watch chain in her hand.
is that true?
i do not know.
why are you saying it?
it is the only way it makes sense.
i hope you are well.
his plan was still working beautifully. wynant was established as being in town.  the watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. the only hitch was a man named nunheim who had found out something.  our hero paid nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
shut up.
you see, he would been very clever. everybody, even our astute friend guild, thought that wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. but our hero had just one weak link in his chain.  the telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen wynant. so he picked on poor mimi here to strengthen his case.  mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.  mimi, who was it that told you to say you would seen wynant?
nobody told me.  i did see him!
what did he pay you, mimi, to stick to that story?
it is not a story - it is true.  i did see wynant.  he is not dead.
you are lying, mimi.  but then, you would do anything for money.  you are getting a good price for saying you saw wynant and you figure you will not get anything if he is dead.
I am lot going to stay here to be insulted -
macaulay, you drew up wynant's will.  mimi was cut off, was not she, if she re-married?
i have no right to answer that.
what about it, tanner.  is not that the truth?
that is what mr. wynant said to me. if she re-married, all the money was to go to the children.
you should not let that keep you from telling truth, mimi.  mrs. jorgensen -  were you ever divorced from chris jorgensen?
