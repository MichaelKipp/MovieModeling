yah, shep proudfoot said -
shep said you would be here at 7:30. what gives, man?
shep said 8:30.
we been sitting here an hour.  I have peed three times already.
I am sure sorry. i - shep told me 8:30. it was a mix-up, i guess.
ya got the car?
yah, you bet. it is in the lot there. brand-new burnt umber ciera.
yeah, okay. well, siddown then.  I am carl showalter and this is my associate gaear grimsrud.
yah, how ya doin'. so, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
sure, jerry, we are all set. why would not we be?
yah, no, I am sure you are. shep vouched for you and all. i got every confidence in you fellas.
...so i guess that is it, then.  here's the keys -
no, that is not it, jerry.
huh?
the new vehicle, plus forty thousand dollars.
yah, but the deal was, the car first, see, then the forty thousand, like as if it was the ransom. i thought shep told you -
shep did not tell us much, jerry.
well, okay, it is -
except that you were gonna be here at 7:30.
yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
yeah, you already said that.
yah. but it is not a whole pay-in- advance deal. i give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
I am not going to debate you, jerry.
okay.
I am not going to sit here and debate. i will say this though: what shep told us did not make a whole lot of sense.
oh, no, it is real sound. it is all worked out.
you want your own wife kidnapped?
yah.
...you-my point is, you pay the ransom- what eighty thousand bucks?  - i mean, you give us half the ransom, forty thousand, you keep half. it is like robbing peter to play paul, it does not make any -
okay, it is - see, it is not me payin' the ransom. the thing is, my wife, she is wealthy - her dad, he is real well off. now, I am in a bit of trouble -
what kind of trouble are you in, jerry?
well, that's, that's, I am not go inta, inta - see, i just need money. now, her dad's real wealthy -
so why do not you just ask him for the money?
or your fucking wife, you know.
or your fucking wife, jerry.
well, it is all just part of this - they do not know i need it, see. okay, so there is that. and even if they did, i would not get it.  so there is that on top, then. see, these are personal matters.
personal matters.
yah. personal matters that needn't, uh -
okay, jerry. you are tasking us to perform this mission, but you, you won't, uh, you will not - aw, fuck it, let's take a look at that ciera.
hon? got the growshries.
thank you, hon. how is fargo?
yah, real good.
dad's here.
yah, pretty good.
whatcha watchin' there?
norstars.
...who they playin'?
ooooooh!  his reaction synchronizes with a reaction from the crowd.
wade, have ya had a chance to think about, uh, that deal i was talkin' about, those forty acres there on wayzata?
you told me about it.
yah, you said you would have a think about it. i understand it is a lot of money -
a heck of a lot. what did you say you were going to put there?
lot. it is a limited -
i know it is a lot.
i mean a parking lot.
yah, well, seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot - ha ha ha!
yah, well, it is a chunk, but -
i thought you were gonna show it to stan grossman. he passes on this stuff before it gets kicked up to me.
well, you know stan'll say no dice. that is why you pay him.  I am asking you here, wade. this could work out real good for me and jean and scotty -
jean and scotty never have to worry.
where is pancakes hause?
what?
we stop at pancakes hause.
what are you, nuts? we had pancakes for breakfast. i got to go somewhere i can get a shot and a beer - and a steak maybe.  not more fuckin' pancakes. come on.
...come on, man. okay, here's an idea. we will stop outside of brainerd. i know a place there we can get laid. wuddya think?
I am fuckin' hungry now, you know.
yeah, yeah, jesus - I am sayin', we will stop for pancakes, then we will get laid. wuddya think?
we sat here right in this room and went over this and over this!
yah, but that trucoat -
i sat right here and said i did not want no trucoat!
yah, but I am sayin', that trucoat, you do not get it and you get oxidization problems. it will cost you a heck of lot more'n five hunnert -
you are sittin' here, you are talkin' in circles! you are talkin' like we did not go over this already!
yah, but this trucoat -
we had us a deal here for nineteen- five. you sat there and darned if you did not tell me you would get this car, these options, without the sealant, for nineteen-five!
okay, I am not sayin' i did not -
you called me twenty minutes ago and said you had it! ready to make delivery, ya says! come on down and get it!  and here ya are and you are wastin' my time and you are wastin' my wife's time and I am payin' nineteen- five for this vehicle here!
well, okay, I will talk to my boss...
so you are goin' to the gophers on sunday?
you bet.
you would not have an extra ticket there?
they are playin' the buckeyes!
yah.
ya kiddin'!
well, he never done this before, but seein' as it is special circumstances and all, he says i can knock one hunnert off that trucoat.
one hundred! you lied to me, mr. lundegaard. you are a bald-faced liar!
one hunnert's the best we can do here.
oh, for christ's sake, where is my goddamn checkbook. let's get this over with.
I am talkin' about your potential.
uh-huh.
you are not a c student.
uhn.
and yet you are gettin' c grades. it is this disparity there that concerns your dad and me.
uh-huh.
you know what a disparity is?
yeah!
okay. well, that is why we do not want ya goin' out fer hockey.
oh, man!
...what's the big deal? it is an hour -
hold on.
...yah, okay...
look, dad, there is no fucking way -
how ya doin', wade?
what is goin' on there?
oh, nothing, wade. how ya doin' there?
stan grossman looked at your proposal. says it is pretty sweet.
no kiddin'?
we might be innarested.
no kiddin'! I would need the cash pretty quick there. in order to close the deal.
come by at 2:30 and we will talk about it. if your numbers are right, stan says its pretty sweet. stan grossman.
yah.
2:30.
say, shep, how ya doin' there?
mm.
say, ya know those two fellas ya put me in touch with, up there in fargo?
put you in touch with grimsrud.
well, yah, but he had a buddy there. he, uh -
well, i do not vouch for him.
well, that is okay, i just -
i vouch for grimsrud. who is his buddy?
carl somethin'?
never heard of him. do not vouch for him.
well, that is okay, he is a buddy of the guy ya vouched for, so I am not worryin'. i just, i was wonderin', see, i got to get in touch with 'em for, i might not need it anymore, sumpn's happenin', see -
call 'em up.
yah, well, see, i did that, and i have not been able to get 'em, so i thought you maybe'd know an alternate number or what have ya.
nope.
...look at that. twin cities.  ids building, the big glass one.  tallest skyscraper in the midwest.  after the sears, uh, chicago...  you never been to minneapolis?
no.
...would it kill you to say something?
i did.
"no." first thing you have said in the last four hours. that is a, that is a fountain of conversation, man. that is a geyser. i mean, whoa, daddy, stand back, man. shit, I am sittin' here driving, man, doin' all the driving, whole fuckin' way from brainerd, drivin', tryin' to, you know, tryin' to chat, keep our spirits up, fight the boredom of the road, and you can not say one fucking thing just in the way of conversation.
yah, real good. how you doin'?
pretty good, mr. lundegaard.  you are damned hard to get on the phone.
yah, it is pretty darned busy here, but that is the way we like it.
that is for sure. now, i just need, on these last, these financing documents you sent us, i can not read the serial numbers of the vehicles on here, so i -
but i already got the, it is okay, the loans are in place, i already got the, the what, the -
yeah, the three hundred and twenty thousand dollars, you got the money last month.
yah, so we are all set.
yeah, but the vehicles you were borrowing on, i just can not read the serial numbers on your application. maybe if you could just read them to me -
but the deal's already done, i already got the money -
yeah, but we have an audit here, i just have to know that these vehicles you are financing with this money, that they really exist.
yah, well, they exist all right.
I am sure they do - ha ha! but i can not read their serial numbers here. so if you could read me -
well, but see, i do not have 'em in front a me - why do not i just fax you over a copy -
no, fax is no good, that is what i have and i can not read the darn thing -
yah, okay, I will have my girl send you over a copy, then.
okay, because if i can not correlate this note with the specific vehicles, then i got to call back that money -
yah, how much money was that?
three hundred and twenty thousand dollars. see, i got to correlate that money with the cars it is being lent on.
yah, no problem, I will just fax that over to ya, then.
no, no, fax is -
i mean send it over. I will shoot it right over to ya.
okay.
okay, real good, then.
unguent.
huh?  grimsurd looks at his thumb.
i need ...unguent.
good to see ya again, jerry. if these numbers are right, this looks pretty sweet.
oh, those numbers are all right, bleemee.
this is do-able.
congratulations, jerry.
yah, thanks, stan, it is a pretty -
what kind of finder's fee were you looking for?
...huh?
the financials are pretty thorough, so the only thing we do not know is your fee.
...my fee? wade, what the heck're you talkin' about?
stan and i're okay.
yah.
we are good to loan in.
yah.
but we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
no, but, wade, see, i was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. it is my deal here, see?
jerry - we thought you were bringin' us an investment.
yah, right -
you are sayin' - what are you sayin'?
you are sayin' that we put in all the money and you collect when it pays off?
no, no. i - i'd, I would - pay you back the principal, and interest heck, I would go - one over prime -
what the heck, jerry, if i wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I would go to midwest federal. talk to bill diehl.
he is at norstar.
he is at -
no, see, i do not need a finder's fee, i need - finder's fee's, what, ten percent, heck that is not going to do it for me. i need the principal.
jerry, we are not just going to give you seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
what the heck were you thinkin'? heck, if I am only gettin' bank interest, I would look for complete security. heck, fdic. i do not see nothin' like that here.
yah, but i - okay, i would, I would guarantee ya your money back.
I am not talkin' about your damn word, jerry. geez, what the heck're you?... well, look, i do not want to cut you out of the loop, but his here's a good deal.  i assume, if you are not innarested, you will not mind if we move on it independently.
shut the fuck up or I will throw you back in the trunk, you know.
geez. that is more'n I have heard you say all week.
this is a new car, then, sir?
it certainly is, officer. still got that smell!
you are required to display temporary tags, either in the plate area or taped inside the back window.
certainly -
can i see your license and registration please?
certainly.
...so maybe the best thing would be to take care of that, right here in brainerd.
what is this, sir?
that is my license and registration. i wanna be in compliance.
you will take care of it. boy, you are smooth smooth, you know.
whoa, daddy.
clear him off the road.

yah, thanks a bunch. so what is the deal, now? gary says triple homicide?
yah, looks pretty bad. two of'm're over here.
where is everybody?
well - it is cold, margie.
okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.
yah.
I would be very surprised if our suspect was from brainerd.
yah.
ya see something down there, chief?
uh - i just, i think I am going to barf.
geez, you okay, margie?
I am fine - it is just morning sickness.
...well, that passed.

oh, yah. norm made some eggs.
yah? well, what now, d'ya think?
let's go take a look at that trooper.
there is two of 'em, lou!
yah?
yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
oh, yah?
how is it look, marge?
well, he is got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. it is a real shame.
yah.
you have not monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
no way.
somebody shut his lights. i guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back.
yah, woulda been cold out here.
heck, yah. ya think, is dave open yet?
you do not think he is mixed up in -
no, no, i just wanna get norm some night crawlers.
you look in his citation book?
yah...
...last vehicle he wrote in was a tan ciera at 2:18 a.m.  under the plate number he put dlr - i figure they stopped him or shot him before he could finish fillin' out the tag number.
uh-huh.
so i got the state lookin' for a ciera with a tag startin' dlr.  they do not got no match yet.
I am not sure i agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, lou.
yah?
yah, i think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. dlr?
oh...
...geez.
yah. say, lou, ya hear the one about the guy who could not afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to j2l 4685?
yah, that is a good one.
yah.
- all's i know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!
no! they said no cops! they were darned clear on that, wade! they said you call the cops and we -
well, a course they are going to say that! but where is my protection? they got jean here! i give these sons a bitches a million dollars, where is my guarantee they are going to let her go.
well, they -
a million dollars is a lot a damn money! and there they are, they got my daughter!
yah, but think this thing through here, wade. ya give 'em what they want, why wont' they let her go? you got to listen to me on this one, wade.
heck, you do not know! you are just whistlin' dixie here! I am sayin', the cops, they can advise us on this! I am sayin' call a professional!
no! no cops! that is final! this is my deal here, wade! jean is my wife here!
i got to tell ya, wade, I am leanin' to jerry's viewpoint here.
well -
we got to protect jean. these - we are not holdin' any cards here, wade, they got all of 'em. so they call the shots.
you are darned tootin'!
ah, dammit!
I am tellin' ya.
well... why do not we...
... stan, I am thinkin' we should offer 'em half a million.
now come on here, no way, wade!  no way!
we are not horse-trading here, wade, we just got to bite the bullet on this thing.
yah!
what is the next step here, jerry?
they are going to call, give me instructions for a drop. I am supposed to have the money ready tomorrow.
okay. we will get the money together. do not worry about it, jerry. now, d'you want anyone at home, with you, until they call?
no, i - they do not want - they are just s'posed to be dealin' with me, they were real clear.
yah.
ya know, they said no one listenin' in, they will be watchin', ya know. maybe it is all bull, but like you said, stan, they are callin' the shots.
okay. and scotty, is he gonna be all right?
yah, geez, scotty. I will go talk to him.
...how ya doin' there, scotty?
dad! what are they doing? wuddya think they are doin' with mom?
it is okay, scotty. they are not going to want to hurt her any.  these men, they just want money, see.
what if - what if sumpn goes wrong?
no, no, nothin's goin' wrong here. grandad and i, we are - we are makin' sure this gets handled right.
dad, i really think we should call the cops.
no! we can not let anyone know about this thing! we got to play ball with these guys - you ask stan grossman, he will tell ya the same thing!
yeah, but -
we are going to get mom back for ya, but we got to play ball. ya know, that is the deal. now if lorraine calls, or sylvia, you just say that mom is in florida with pearl and marty...
yah.

uh-huh.
...how's the paintin' goin'?

they are good, norm, but you are better'n them.
yah, ya think?
how we doin' on that vehicle?
no motels registered any tan ciera last night. but the night before, two men checked into the blue ox registering a ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
geez, that is a good lead. the blue ox, that is that trucker's joint out there on i-35?

yah.
so you were having sex with the little fella, then?
uh-huh.

no. like i say, he was funny-looking. more'n most people even.
and what about the other fella?
he was a little older. looked like the marlboro man.
yah?
yah. maybe I am sayin' that cause he smoked marlboros.
uh-huh.

yah.
good day, sir.
...yah.

dammit! i wanna be a part a this thing!
no, wade! they were real clear! they said they would call tomorrow, with instructions, and it is going to be delivered by me alone!
it is my money, I will deliver it - what do they care?
wade's got a point there. I will handle the call if you want, jerry.
no, no. see - they, no, see, they only deal with me. ya feel this, this nervousness on the phone there, they are very - these guys're dangerous -
all the more reason!  i do not want you - with all due respect, jerry - i do not want you mucking this up.
the heck d'ya mean?
they want my money, they can deal with me. otherwise I am goin' to a professional.  he points at a briefcase.
...there's a million dollars here!
no, see -
look, jerry, you are not sellin' me a damn car. it is my show here.  that is that.
...what do you mean, you decided not to park here?
yeah, i just came in. i decided not to park here.
you, uh... I am sorry, sir, but -
i decided not to - i'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
I am sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
i just pulled in here. i just fucking pulled in here!
well, see, there is a minimum charge of four dollars. long-term parking charges by the day.
nope.
well, you do reside their at 1425 fremont terrace?
yep.
anyone else residing there?
nope.
well, mr. proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning.  it is just hard for me to believe you can not remember anyone calling.
...now, i know you have had some problems, struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements, currently on parole -
so?
well, associating with criminals, if you are the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in stillwater.
uh-huh.
now, i saw some rough stuff on your priors, but nothing in the nature of a homicide...
...i know you do not want to be an accessory to something like that.
nope.
so you think you might remember who those folks were who called ya?
mr. lundegaard?
huh? yah?
i wonder if i could take just a minute of your time here -
what... what is it all about?
huh? do you mind if i sit down - I am carrying quite a load here.
...you're the owner here, mr. lundegaard?
naw, i... executive sales manager.
well, you can help me. my name's marge gunderson -

uh-huh. well, I am a police officer from up brainerd investigating some malfeasance and i was just wondering if you have had any new vehicles stolen off the lot in the past couple of weeks - specifically a tan cutlass ciera?
...mr. lundegaard?

I am sorry.
yah, i, uh... she had leukemia, you know...

I am sorry, mike.

officer olson.
yah, right-o.
...so, I am tendin' bar there at ecklund & swedlin's last tuesday and this little guy's drinkin' and he says, 'so where can a guy find some action - I am goin' crazy down there at the lake.'  and i says, 'what kinda action?' and he says, 'woman action, what do i look like,' and i says 'well, what do i look like, i do not arrange that kinda thing,' and he says, 'i'm goin' crazy out there at the lake' and i says, 'well, this am not that kinda place.'
uh-huh.
so he says, 'so i get it, so you think I am some kinda jerk for askin',' only he does not use the word jerk.
i unnerstand.
and then he calls me a jerk and says the last guy who thought he was a jerk was dead now. so i do not say nothin' and he says, 'what do ya think about that?'  so i says, 'well, that do not sound like too good a deal for him then.'
ya got that right.
and he says, 'yah, that guy's dead and i do not mean a old age.' and then he says, 'geez, I am goin' crazy out there at the lake.'
white bear lake?
well, ecklund & swedlin's, that is closer ta moose lake, so i made that assumption.
oh sure.
so, ya know, he is drinkin', so i do not think a whole great deal of it, but mrs. mohra heard about the homicides out here and she thought i should call it in, so i called it in. end a story.
what did this guy look like anyways?
oh, he was a little guy, kinda funny- lookin'.
uh-huh - in what way?
just a general way.
okay, well, thanks a bunch, mr. mohra. you are right, it is probably nothin', but thanks for callin' her in.
oh sure. they say she is going to turn cold tomorrow.
yah, got a front movin' in.
ya got that right.

i unnerstand. I will keep it real short, then. I am on my way out of town, but i was just - do you mind if i sit down? I am carrying a bit of a load here.
no, i -
yah, it is this vehicle i asked you about yesterday. i was just wondering -
yah, like i told ya, we have not had any vehicles go missing.
okay, are you sure, cause, i mean, how do you know?  because, see, the crime I am investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. and they called someone who works here, so it would be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
