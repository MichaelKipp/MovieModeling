he doesn't miss a trick, does he?
what a jerk -- and like nobody knows who he really is!
oh don't start that again --
look!
he's lance hunt! just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
there's a vague similarity.
a vague similarity? it's the same guy!
oh, who gives a damn who he is? i can't take this anymore. night after night we're on the streets, busting our humps -- and for what?
we take the licks and he gets the chicks.
how long do you have to chase a dream before you realize it's not gonna happen?
we need a break, that's all! nobody'd ever heard of him until he busted casanova frankenstein!
but look at him... and look at us.
why do they always fill stuff these things so full you can't pull 'em out without ripping 'em!
i lost another fork tonight. she's getting suspicious, i know it.
so why don't you just tell her!
i can't.
why not?
because i can't! okay? she wouldn't understand!
leave him alone. she's his mother, not yours.
we had an off night, that's all.
so when are we gonna have an on night?
you guys going to a costume party?
we're superheroes.
really? like captain amazing?
are you famous?
not yet.
so you're like... struggling superheroes?
we prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... i am the blue raja, master of silverware...
wow.
and these are my associates, the shoveler.
hi.
and mister furious... his anger is his power.
really?
usually a superpower is a magical endowment or a great skill. in his case, it's entirely emotional.
so what can i get you?
burgers all around.  medium.  rare.  raw.
she likes you.
definitely.
ask her out.
nah.
roy, when was the last time you had an actual date?
what does it matter? women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. they want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  and then they dump you.
so you're chicken?
who's chicken?
doesn't it piss you off the way the when you really want to talk to somebody you can't think of anything to say!
i guess... are you always so angry?
only when i'm awake... you busy after work?
or talk?
not tonight.
maybe you should try a more romantic approach.
like what? cutting off my own ear?
or flowers.
see ya tomorrow.
jeffrey!
oh hi, mom.
what are you doing in the silver drawer?
looking for... the tv guide.
it's on the television.
of course. i'm such a fool... thanks, mummy.
i hope you enjoy these cigars. i had to kill a dozen cubans to get them.
ummm.
have you considered my offer?
you know, mr. f, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. you had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. you were the king...
but times have changed, and you been in that bug house a long tine. i can see you still got the style, but i dunno for sure you still got the edge.
i got it.
what about captain amazing?
i knew you'd come. i left that skylight open for you.
i know you did.
i knew you'd know.
i know you knew i'd know.
but did you know i knew you'd know i'd know?
of course.
the jig is up, casanova. i've spent six months watching you, and know exactly what you're up to.
really?
i know that you're recruiting your old henchmen...
and i know the terrible revenge that you plan to inflict on this city.
i guess you know just about everything, don't you, lance?
um-hmm.
except for one little thing.
and what's that?
that i've hot wired the city's entire power supply through that catwalk.
what --?
i saw him go in -- and he didn't come out!
but we don't know for sure it's the same guy.
let's go.
wait!... look!
this is bad.
who are they?
the disco boys.
the who?
the most vicious gang of thugs this city ever produced. twenty years ago they were casanova's personal bodyguard. but after he was busted they crawled into the woodwork.
well they've crawled back out.
we may be getting in over our heads here.
this looks like a job for superman --
or batman --
or both.
everything's going exactly as we planned.
not quite. you haven't announced our engagement yet.
it must have slipped my mind.
your mind is so slippery.
don't worry, pootchkie. my womanizing days are over. you're my lady macbeth, my imelda... my nicole.  we're such an incredible team. who could possibly stop us?
don't crunch the leaves.
sorry.
be a mohican.
i'm soaked.  oh great.
shhh.
be a mohican.
shut up.
superheroes.
should i kill them?
why bother?
here you go.
ow.
maybe you guys ought to forget this superhero stuff and join kiwanis or something.
maybe she's right.
are you serious? this is the break we've been waiting for!
what are you talking about?
what have the famous superheroes got that we don't?
agents?
archenemies! casanova isn't just a criminal -- he's a supervillain. stopping him could be our ticket to fame, fortune -- and babes!
and it would be the right thing to do.
yeah yeah -- and that, too.
but there's only three of us, and he's got the entire brotherhood of evil at his disposal.
then maybe it's time for us to form our own brotherhood... a brotherhood of righteous, crime fighting, skull cracking, disco boy bashing, warriors of the night!
i'm liking this.
i say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
do we have to?
i got this cousin. he's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
have you ever seen him?
how could i see him if he's invisible?
good point.
and there's the sphinx.
the who?
he's a legendary masked mexican crime fighting superwrestler and master of the machete.
sounds good.
no one's sure that he actually exists, but they say he can be contacted by leaving a message on a crumpled up napkin at the tacky taco down by the bus station.
you sure that's how you spell it?
yeah.
so, let me get this straight. you have the power to become invisible.
yes.
but... only when no one is looking.
yes.
if someone looks at you, you immediately become visible again.
yes.
so you're only invisible... to yourself?
no.
so you're only invisible, when absolutely no one is looking at you?
yes.
so how do you know that you've ever been invisible?
i just know.
look, kid, we've got a lot of heroes to interview --
i know i haven't got it entirely worked out yet, but i've always dreamed of becoming a superhero... weren't you guys ever a kid? didn't you ever need someone to just give you a chance?
there's just not enough of us.
but we know they're out there. hundreds -- maybe thousands of lonely, unknown superheroes, who desperately need a cause...
and a social life.
yeah, but how do we get to them?
maybe there was traffic.
who are we kidding? no one's gonna show. we're living in a fantasy!
come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.
good or evil, what's the difference?
there's a big difference.
i used to believe that. now i'm not so sure.
roy, remember, it is all within your power. the only thing that's in your way... is you.
oh shut up.
who are you?
i'm the bowler.
the bowler? i remember him from when i was a kid. he was killed years ago.
i'm his daughter.
look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
really?
hey... can i buy you a beer?
i thought you'd never ask.
and then one day, he didn't come home. the police said it was an accident. but cargo containers don't just fall on people. he was murdered... after that i fell apart. i dropped out of school, became a mud wrestler, married and divorced a jerk. when my mother died i hit bottom... but then, when i was cleaning out her attic, i found my father's old bowling bag and costume, almost like he'd left them there for me... and i knew what i had to do.
so who killed him?
the disco boys.
you know something? those guys are really starting to piss me off!
but there's still only six of us.
so what?
that's two more than the fantastic four.
half a dirty dozen!
and you can't count horst buckholtz anyway.
he was cute though.
but they all had one thing we haven't got.
how about... the savage six?
the inscrutable six?
the obliterators!
the eradicators!
what did you do with captain amazing?
captain who?
that boy's got talent.
and i'm gonna nip it in the bud.
to us!
whatever our name is.
but she's your mother. you gotta tell her.
i can't.
i'm her only son, and she always had such high hopes for me. medicine. law.
but you're a superhero.
the cape. the turban. she wouldn't understand.
i know... my girlfriends all dumped me after i put on the mask. they thought i'd lost it.
but in fact... you'd found it.
it's late. i'm headin' home.
me, too.
come on, junior, it's a school night.
you're the sphinx.
and you are a fool.
so what else has superman got?
he's got the fact that he's superman!
firepower costs money.
anybody got any?
we didn't think this through very well.
my father had this friend... he was an inventor...
are you sure he's still lives here?
are you sure he's still alive?
he was the last time i saw him.
when was that?
i was eight.
yes!
doctor heller?
yes!
it's me... elizabeth.
elizabeth! little elizabeth! why you're so... middle aged!
thanks.
how's your dad?
he's dead.
oh that's right -- they squished him... heck of a guy.
doc, these are my friends. we're superheroes, and we need your help.
well, i give to the united way, and i feel that sort of covers --
but, doc... where's the machine guns?
the bazookas?
twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and casanova was their king.
crime was rampant. it wasn't safe to stay in your home.
much less go outside.
then captain amazing appeared.
he busted casanova and sent the crooks packing.
and this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
but now casanova's back! and we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
the wise snake coils before he strikes.
and a skunk stinks!
you drink too much.
when are you going to take off that mask?
when i am sure i am among friends.
roy --
go dance with your mother, jeffrey!
your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
my heart died a long time ago.
it is not dead. it is hiding.
blow it out your bean hole, pancho!... and to hell with the rest of you!... look at you. bunch of rejects. i didn't need you before -- and i don't need you now!  the great ones ride alone!  adios, muchachos!
hi.
alone tonight?
every night.
monica... i was wondering if -- uh -- maybe we -- i mean you and i -- could -- uh -- you know -- get a -- i mean have a...
date?
yeah.
i get off work in fifteen minutes. walk me home?
sure.
that was easy.
where are you going?
head hunting.
i admire you.
why?
being a superhero, wanting to save the world. it's so... unselfish.
it is?
most people just want to make money or be famous or something. but you risk everything, just to help people.
i wouldn't mind being famous.
who wouldn't?
i've never been able to figure out what to do with my life, which is why i guess i'm still a waitress.
nothing wrong with being a waitress.
what's your real name?
roy.
have you always lived here?
me too... i love this stupid old town. it's noisy. it's smelly. it's falling apart.
it's home.
yeah.
i've thought of leaving, going to chicago or new york, but...
what have they got that we ain't got?
champion's going to bounce back, and i want to be here when it does.
me, too.
you don't seem very angry right now.
you know what? underneath all that anger i think there's just a little boy who wants everyone to love him.
i just want to be a superhero.
that's what i mean... 'night, roy.
i'll let you in on a little secret, roy. in two days this entire city will belong to me, and there's not a damn thing your little pals can do about it. it's the perfect time to switch teams... so what do you say?
you're nuts.
they always call the great ones nuts.
and the nuts always call themselves great.
are you with me... or against me?
against.
too bad. plug him!
thanks for reminding me which team i'm on.
you're dead.
so are you!
casanova said that in two days the entire city would belong to him... and there wasn't a thing that we could do about it.
what did he mean?
i dunno.
maybe it's time we checked that place out.
but how do we get in?
so where's the art?
he hasn't stolen it yet.
this place is built like a fortress.
because that's what it is.
what's that?
come on.
i hope you won't take this the wrong way, but i couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for veronica lake in "the blue dahlia".
really?
are you an actress?
just a waitress.
you underestimate yourself.
you know i'm writing a play -- it's just a little broadway thing, but there's a part in it that i think you'd be perfect for.
really?
i'd love to hear you read it. could you stick around after the luncheon?
sure -- i guess.
terrific.
that was too close.
but we gotta find out what's going on in there.
no one will believe us.
they'll think we're just a bunch of weirdoes.
we're outnumbered twenty to one.
it's suicide.
maybe. but this isn't about living or dying. it's about good versus evil, and we're good, whether we like it or not... maybe we look a little funny...
and smell a little funny. we're not bulletproof and we can't fly. but we're superheroes -- and that means doing what's right -- even when it's impossible... this is our city -- these are our friends, our families -- and if we don't save them, nobody will! so i say we take a ride up that hill, blast our way in there, destroy that psycho-whatchamabob -- and teach those deviants a lesson they'll never forget!
now you're talking.
sounds good to me.
let's do it.
we could really use some coffee --
and some sandwiches --
but that place is huge and we don't know where this psycho thing is --
or even what it looks like.
jeffrey, you thief!
mother... it's not what you think!
and why are you wearing that silly costume?
because... i'm a superhero!
oh, mother, i'm sorry. i know how much you wanted me to be a doctor or a lawyer with a family -- but it's just not who i am!
but... the silverware?
i use it... to fight evil.
jeffrey... this is wonderful.
it is?
i always knew that you were special.
you did?
ever since you were a little boy...  come with me.
mon captain, it's for you.
hello?
it's me.
monica, where are you?
at the frankenstein center.
are you nuts? get out of there!
i'm going inside.
what are you talking about?
listen, casanova may be a supervillain, but he's got a weakness, and i'm it. maybe -- just maybe -- i can trick him into showing me the location of the whatchamathing.
he's a psycho! he'll kill you!
just shut up and listen. hold off the attack as long as you can. if i can discover the location i'll call you --
and what if you get killed?
then at least i will have died trying, right?
roy... we might never see each other again, so i'd better tell you now... i think you're wonderful.
what?
bye.
monica!
hey... you okay?
sure.
hi.
i thought you'd chickened out on me.
just wanted to... powder my nose.
how 'bout giving me "the tour"?
why not?
who's the artist?
me.
we're all the same really. our songs, our dreams, our seeds are all just a brave attempt to live forever.
he is in love. his anger is gone.
oh no.
great timing!
snap out of it!
get on to yourself!
get mad!
but i just don't feel it.
he's turned into a completely normal person!
normal. what's normal? does normal exist? and if it did, how would we know it?
your spiderman pez dispenser!
okay, you win. i'm pissed off. i'm seriously peeved.
come here.
i'm not that kind of girl.
then why are you here?
curiosity.
remember the cat.
what are you doing all alone in the dark?
fantasizing... about you.
i thought you were done?
one last tweak.
it's time.
with or without him, we gotta go!
our guests are waiting.
i'll be down in a jiffy.
i'd better go.
you're a spy.
what?
i saw him walk you home.
who?
roy.
stay away!
or you'll what? can me?
but she still might call!
are you coming or not?
i'll drive.
not a chance!
we've got lift off!
may the forks be with us!
come on, baby!
do it, big boy!
atta, girl!
atta, boy!
where am i going?
through there!
right.
cover me!
with what?
he'll never make it.
think positive.
you two timing psychotic bastard.
darling, you've got the wrong idea.
do i?
i was only strangling her... i've killed hundreds of women. it doesn't mean a thing.  pootchkie, you're over-reacting. this is our night. it's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. she's just a plaything, a trifle... you're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. i adore you. i worship you. i want to make you my bride.
and the light goes out...
frankenstein!
let me guess... bullets don't hurt you.
they hurt... but they don't stop me!
hey, do i look like a man?
well we can't call ourselves the mystery people.
eat your mustard.
it doesn't matter what we call ourselves. we know who we are.
yes, obie-wan.
hey... he's gone.
