hey, look at him. tommy. you grew up.
billy, how are you?
son of a bitch. get over here.
hey, billy. watch the suit.
listen to him.  "watch the suit," he says.  a little pisser I have known all my life.  hey, tommy, do not go get too big.
do not go busting my balls. okay?
busting his balls?  if i was busting your balls, I would send you home for your shine box.
you remember tommy's shines? the kid was great.  he made mirrors.
no more shines, billy.
come ooonnn. tommeeee. we are only kidding. you can not take a joke? come ooonn.
come on, relax. he is drunk.  he is been locked up for six years.
i do not give a shit. that guy's got no right.
tommy. he. does not mean anything. forget about it.
he is insulting me. rat bastard. he is never been any fuckin' good.
tommy.  come on. relax.
keep him here. I am going for a bag.
what are we going to do with him? we can not dump him in the street.
bring the car round back. i know a place upstate they will never find him.
batts's made. his whole crew is going to be looking for him. this is fucking bad.
there is a shovel at my mother's.
what happened to you?
i can not make any more deliveries.
whadda you mean, you can not make any more deliveries? you are going to fuck up everything?
my father got a letter from the school. he said the next time he will kill me.
it was the first time i had ever seen anyone shot.
you are some fucking jerk.
i you wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :
i remember feeling bad about the guy. but i remember feeling that maybe tuddy was right.  i knew paulie did not want anybody dying in the building.
keep 'em coming.
jimmy was one of the most feared gays in the city.  he was first locked up at eleven and was doing hits for mob bosses when he was sixteen. hits never bothered him. it was business. but what he really loved to do was steal.  i mean, he actually enjoyed it.  jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted for the bad guys in the movies.  he was one of the city's biggest hijackers. clothes. razor blades. booze. cigarettes. shrimp and lobsters. shrimp and lobsters were the best. they went fast.
if you knew those fucking kids. they are nuts. especially that tommy. what am i going to do with them?
but I am worried. I am hearing all kinds of things. paulie.  you know me all my life.  I have always done the right thing.
you think that matters?  you think they give a shit about anything? the little bastards.
but it is not right, paulie. that tommy, he is making trouble for me all over town.  i can not go here.  i can not go there.
you?  you think you are the only one?  I have talked to them a million times, but they do not listen.
but, paulie, please.
someday they will get what is coming to them. that is the only way they will stop.
paulie, i swear, I am afraid. the guy's nuts. what do i have to do? whatever i got to do, I will do.
what can i do? if i could do something, do not you think i would?
tell him. it is okay.
what?
you want a partner?
please?
you got to help me. okay? this girl i told you about? diana? she is from the five towns. she is jewish. she will not go out with me alone. can you believe this shit? she is fucking prejudiced, but she is built. she is never been out with an italian before. she says she will only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  you believe this shit? but you got to see her. i mean, she is beautiful.
will you get the fuck out of here.
is it my fault she will not go out without her girlfriend?  for chrissake.  come on.  you do not even have to stay.  jeesuz!  what is the big deal?
tommy  ...
i had a meeting with tuddy around eleven of the clock and here i am a back-up guy.
have more coffee.  it will wake you up.
i could not wait to get away. i was ordering the dessert when they were eating dinner. when they were having coffee, i was asking for a check.
i did not know, i swear.  i thought it was next week.
liar!
take it easy.  we can talk about it.
she is screaming on the street and i mean loud, but she looked good. she had these violet eyes.  i remember she is screaming, but mostly I am looking at her eyes. they were just like elizabeth taylor's. that is what everybody said.
talk? to you? after what you did!
i thought you were going to stand me up. you looked bored. you did not say anything. what did you expect. tommy was all over me. right?
what are you doing? what about the car?
he watches it for me. it is better than waiting at a garage.
what do you do?
I am in construction.
they do not feel like you are in construction.
i did not agree to three points over the vig.- what am i nuts? i did not need it that much.
what are you gonna do? fight with him?  he wants his money.
you got money for your bullshit television, do not you?  i got to watch you swimming back and forth on tv all night long, do not i? you got money for that, but you do not have my money?
jimmy. he will be okay. he is good for it. relax.
go inside. I will be right there.
what are you gonna do?
get inside!
my bag. my bag.
what bag?
the bag with the envelopes.
oh that. do not worry about that. nobody's going to steal it.
he did not call?
he is with his friends.
what kind of person does not call?
he is a grown man. be does not have to call every five minutes.
if he was so grown up he would get you two an apartment.
do not bring that up. you are the one who wanted us here.
look. he is got the whole house in an uproar.
he is got your father upset. good thing he does not have to go to work in the morning. is this what he deserves?
ma!  please! you are driving me crazy.
driving you crazy?  do not get me started.  you are here a month and sometimes i know he does not come home at all. what kind of people are these?
ma!  stop! what do you want me to do?
do?  what can you do?  what did you expect?  he was not jewish. did you know bow they live?  your father would never stay out this late without calling.  in thirty years he never stayed out all night.
stayed out? daddy never went out at all.
you think i do not know? you think i like to keep this inside? but i gotta, or he will kill the miserable bastard and he will be there for life. it is disgusting what you have to put up with.
look at jeannie's kid.
what? what happened?
the oldest one.  he was in an argument. a lousy ten-dollar card game. the kid pulls out a gun. it goes off. the kid gets killed. the grandmother hears it and finds out he is been arrested. she has a heart attack.  she drops dead right on the spot. now jeannie's got a husband and son in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.
but he was always a bad kid, that one.
no. come on. it was the younger one that was the bad one.
i do not know. i do not know if i could live that way. what if, god forbid, you go to prison. mickey said jeannie's husband --
are you nuts?  jeannie's husband went to the can just to get away from her, she is such a pain in the ass. let me tell you. nobody goes to jail unless they want to, unless they make themselves get caught. they do stuff with the wrong people. they do not have things organized. you know who goes to jail? nigger stickup men. that is who. and they only get caught because they fall asleep in the getaway car.
I am going to need some money.
how much?
what did you hear about that thing?
what thing? the brooklyn thing?
no. no. the guy from downtown.
the guy from near where christie used to live?
no. the other one. the one who disappeared up the block from christie. the one they made a beef on.
oh i him.
we got a problem, that thing we took care of upstate?
paulie was just talking about him.
well, we gotta dig him up again.
what?
the guy just sold the property. they are going to build condominiums and i do not want anybody digging up the little bastard.
it is been six months.
it is still better than letting somebody find him.
if paulie finds out, we got problems.
fuck paulie. if batts' crew finds we whacked him, we got real problems.
tommy, do not fuck around. put the gun away. tommy!
no, no. it is okay.
tommy, come on. put the gun away.
no. it is okay. just watch this. watch it.
i do not care. something is going on.
that again.
henry.  wake up.
what is the matter with you?  you are crazy.
it is all bullshit. i swear. it is nothing. whatever you want, we will do.
the truth was, that no matter how bad i felt, i was still very attracted to him. why should i give him up to someone else? why should she win?
son of a bitch.
we are going to feed the bastard to the lions.
what lions? I am not going near any lions.
we only have to shove'em over the moat.
i thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten of the clock this morning?
I am just having my last few drinks.
I have been all over town. i got a call from the bondman.  he says they are going to rescind your bail if you do not show up and sign in right now. they are going to take away the house.
shit.
you son of a bitch. she is been here.
what are you talking about?
do not lie to me. i saw her name in the register.
jezuz christ!
you want her to visit you?  good! let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
what am i doing? I am in here! I am in jail. i can not stop people from coming to see me.
stop! stop!
let her carry this shit inside.
nobody's helping me. tommy got four years. marty and fran are broke.  i asked your friend remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
it will be okay.
he told me to take the kids to the police station and make the cops put me on welfare.
we have got to help each other.
even paulie, since he got out, i hardly see him.
it is only you and me. that is what happens when you go away. we are on our own. forget everybody.  forget paulie.  as long as he is on parole he does not want anybody doing anything.
i can not do it anymore.
yes, you can. I have got it set up. we will be fine. all i need is for you to keep bringing the stuff. I have got a guy in here from pittsburgh who will move it for me. believe me, in a month we will be fine. we will not need anybody.
I am afraid. I am afraid if paulie finds out.
do not worry about paulie. is he helping you? is he putting food on the table? we have got to help ourselves. we just have to be careful while we do it.
i do not want to hear about her anymore.
never.
get packed.  we are getting out of here.
with what?
do not worry with what. you just start looking for a new place. I am going to pittsburgh in the morning. the guys from pittsburgh they owe me fifteen grand from our little partnership and it is only the beginning.
but you have got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and  i promised we would take judy to f.a.o. schwarz.
do not worry about it. you listening to me? now, come on. we got to go see paulie.
i do not want any more of that shit.
wha?  me?
just stay away from the garbage. yon know what i mean.
me? why would i get into that shit?
i know what you did inside. you did what you had to do. I am not talking about that.  I am talking from now on, outside. I am talking right here.
why would i get into that?
I am not going to get fucked like gribbs. he is seventy years old and the fucking guy is going to die in prison.  i do not need that. i do not care who it is. I am warning everybody. gribbs got twenty years just because he said hello to some fuck who was sneaking around selling junk behind his back. that is not going to happen to me.  you understand?
paulie. why would i? i swear.
you are only home early because we got you a job, right? and i do not need any heat. you understand?
nods.
and, if you hear about anybody else fucking around with that shit, you tell me.
nods again.
anybody!  you understand?
i understand.
it is a fait accompli?
done.
and jimmy's in it, right?
will you stop.
i had everybody working.  even our old babysitter.
she is beautiful.  look at her. henry, look at her.
hello!  hello!  have a good flight?
where did you find such creeps?
they are okay and it is worth it. am not it?
stay there.
do not start. i told you to clean up. look at this place. it is a pigpen. look around here. why do you think i bought you the dishwasher? look. look at this.  there is enough powder around here to put us all away.
i hate to do dishes.
hey, come on. i gotta meet somebody.
so do i.
are you okay? what happened?
nothing. i dropped the soap. that is all.
i want to talk to jimmy.
he heard.
but i got two hundred and fifty coming.  it is my share.  jimmy owes me.
marty, please. let me talk to him.
for christmas. your share.  it is just a taste.
jimmy.
we did it.  we did it.
give'm a drink.
i gotta talk to you.
have a drink first.
oh yeah? anything you say.
what is going on? what happened to stacks? is everything okay?
do not worry about it.
there are cops all over the place.
so what?  where are they gonna go?
paulie's going to make him?
who else? paulie got the okay. this little guinea fuck. someday he is going to be a boss. can you believe someday we will work for him.
what will i tell fran?
who gives a fuck? tall her he ran away with a broad. what do you care about her.
watch this.
come on, do not fuck around, will ya?
i do it all the time. bust their fucking balls.
jimmy, come on. fuck 'em. do not give them the satisfaction.
you want the melon?
nah.
i better call again.
jimmy and i could never be made, because we bad irish blood. it did not even matter that my mother was sicilian. to become a member of a crew, you have got to be one hundred percent italian so that they can trace all your relatives back to the old country.
what fucking good are these things? they do not fit. what do i need this for? I am not paying for this shit.
right away i knew he did not want them. i knew i was going to get stuck for the money. i only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. and now, he did not want them. i did not say a thing. jimmy was so pissed he did not even say goodbye.
you ready?
yeah.
tell michael not to 1et the sauce stick.
you know what to do?
yeah, yeah.
now this is important. make sure you leave the house when you make the call. you understand? do you hear me? it is important.  call from an outside phone. i mean it.
jesus! you must think I am dumb. what are you bugging me for? i know what to do!
just make sure you do it. you know what i mean?
i do not need this... you said tonight and now it is not tonight...
it is okay. I will make it up.  i promise. just hurry it up a little. okay?
okay?
i gotta go home.
what for? i got a pound of stuff in my jacket I have been carrying around all day. we got to start taping it to your leg.
i gotta go home and get my hat.
do you realize what we are involved in here now?
i do not care. i need my hat.  i will not go without it.
what could i do?  if she insisted, i had to drive her home for her goddamn hat.  i threw the package in the kitchen and went to take her hone.
jimmy's calling every day. it is urgent.
what did he say, exactly?
at least jimmy and mickey want to help. i talk to mickey every day. that is more than i can say for the rest.
paul will calm down. you will see.
i told jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. be wants to know what is happening. you got to meet him.
fuck jimmy and the money. did not i tell you i got to get out of here first.  i got to straighten every- thing out with paulie or I am dead.
then you are safer in here.
safe? here? they will kill me here. they are all afraid I am going to rat them out. people are already looking to walk away from me. I am dead in here. you got to get me out.
who is going to do that?
just get me out.
so now my plan was to stay alive long enough to sell off the dope that the cops never found and disappear for a while until i got things straightened out.
where is the stuff?
what are you talking about?
you know. the stuff i left.
i flushed it down the toilet.
you what?
what did you want me to do with it? they were all over the house.
are you fucking nuts? that was forty, fifty thousand.  i need it. i was depending on that money.
they had a warrant. they went through everything. they would have found it. i swear.
shit you know they would have never found it. why did you do it? why did you do it? my god, why did you have to do it?
oh no! no!  noooo!
i warned you a million times.
I have been all fucked up since i got out.
you think i did not know what you were doing?
it was easy money. i did it in the can.  shit! i learned the junk business in the can, paulie.
right in my face. you looked in my face and you lied.
but, paulie, I am sorry. believe me.  i was fucking crazy.  but I am okay now. i can be trusted.  I am clean now. on my children. believe me! two weeks cold turkey waiting for bail got my head together...
you thought i was some fucking jerk?
paulie, i could not come to you. i did not want to put you in this shit.  i was ashamed to come to you. i knew i was wrong.
paulie.  you are all i got.  i need help.
you treated me like shit.
here. take it.  now i gotta turn my back on you.
thirty-two hundred bucks. that is what he gave me. thirty-two hundred bucks for a lifetime. it would not have paid for the coffin.
how is he? okay? are they busting his chops?
he is okay. they sobered him up.
did he say what they are asking him about?
jimmy.  i do not know.  i got so much else on my mind.  i got the kids.  we got no money.
i gotta talk to him as soon as i can.
he says he is too hot.  he does not even know i came here today.  it is like he is crazy. jimmy.
i know. i know. but it will be okay. do not worry. i got some money for you. it is down the block.
the third store down.
jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. it felt funny. i started walking down the block, but i noticed the stores were empty.
what happened? you okay?
i got seared.
okay. do not worry about it. it is okay.
i got scared.
i can not eat,  just get me some coffee.
he was jumpy. he had not touched a thing. in the old days, jimmy would have ordered doubles and eaten it all.  on the surface, of course, everything was supposed to be fine. we were supposed to be discussing my case, just like we always would, but i had a feeling jimmy was trying to sense whether i was going to rat him out to save my neck.
i think you got a good shot at beating the case.
how?
it is that rat bastard from pittsburgh. he ratted you all out. he is been a rat since he got busted in pittsburgh.
yeah.
he is hiding, the son of a bitch, in florida.
yeah.
i want you and anthony to go down there and take care of that bastard. without him, they have got no case.
we will pack up everything and send it to you.
i got dry cleaning.
we will pick it up.
what about the schools?
yeah. what about the kids' school?
do not worry about the schools. we will take care of the schools.
i do not want them left back.
they will not be left back. they will stay in their grade.
that is important.
