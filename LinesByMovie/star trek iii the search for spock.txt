aye sir, coding now.
dr. marcus, it's your planet.
this is where the fun begins, saavik!
like your father... so human.  all units functional, recorders are on... scanning sector one. foliage in fully developed state of growth. temperature, twenty- two point two celsius.
sector two... indicating desert terrain. minimal vegetation, temperature thirty-nine point four.
sector three... sub-tropical vegetation... temperature --  temperature decreasing rapidly --
it's snow. snow in the same sector. fantastic!
... fascinating.
all the varieties of land and weather known to earth within a few hours walk!
you must be very proud of what you and your mother have created.
it's a little early to celebrate.
same sector. metallic mass.
underground deposit?
negative, on surface... a manufactured object.
there's only one thing it could be... short range scan.
approximately two meters long... cylindrical in form...
a photon tube...!
could it be spock's?
it has to be. gravitational fields were in flux... it must have soft landed...!
in code to starfleet... captain's spock's tube located intact on genesis surface. will relay more data on subsequent orbits.
on course, admiral. estimating spacedock in two point one hours.
very well.  mr. chekov, i need pre-approach scan... take the science station, please.
uhura, any response from starfleet on our project genesis inquiries?
no, sir, no response.
hmm.. very odd.  scotty. progress report?
i'm almost done, sir. you'll be fully automated by the time we dock.
your timing is excellent, mr. scott. you've fixed the barn door after the horse has come home. how much refit time till we can take her out again?
eight weeks, sir.  but you don't have eight weeks so i'll do it for ya in two.
mr. scott. have you always multiplied your repair estimates by a factor of four?
certainly, sir. how else can i keep my reputation as a miracle worker?
your reputation is secure, scotty.  mr. sulu, take the con. i'll be in my quarters.
steady... steady, boys. keep scanning...  i thought you people were reliable... where the hell is he!
he has been here for some time. i can feel his presence.
don't give me your klingon mumbo- jumbo -- there ain't another vessel in this whole damn quadrant.
put me on the hailing frequency.
sure - whatever games you wanna play.
what's going on? when do we get paid off...?
soon, captain... quite soon.
i'll be in my quarters. execute course to the federation boundary.
yes, my lord!
new orbit commencing... coming up on sector three...
short range scan.
as before... metallic mass... verifying triminium photon tube... no new data.
check for trace radiation. infrared enhancement.
... radiation residual... level is minimal...
i don't believe it...
what is it?
if equipment is functioning properly, indications are -- an animal life form.
you said there wouldn't be any.
there <u>shouldn't</u> be any. only plant forms were built into the genesis matrix.
cross referenced and verified. an unidentifiable life form reading.
do you wish to advise starfleet, sir?
wait a minute...! we don't know what we're talking about here...
why don't we beam it up?
oh no you don't! regulations specifically state: "nothing shall be beamed aboard until danger of contamination has been eliminated." can you guarantee that?
not from here, no.
captain... the logical alternative is obvious... beaming down to the surface is permitted...
"... if the captain decides that the mission is vital and reasonably free of danger." i know the book, saavik.
captain, please -- we'll take the risk. we've <u>got</u> to find out what it is...
... or <u>who</u>.
all right -- get your gear. i'll put you down next time around.
thank you... <u>sir</u>!
standby automatic approach system ... advise approach control.
approach control... this is enterprise. ready for docking maneuver.
would you look at that?
my friends, the great experiment: excelsior, ready for trial runs...
mr. scott...
i'm sorry, sir, but as far as i'm concerned, there's nothin' needed for space travel that this old girl doesn't already have.
come, come, scotty. young minds. fresh ideas.  be tolerant.
mr. chekov -- ?
an energy reading from 'c" deck -- from inside mr. spock's quarters...
mr. chekov, i ordered spock's quarters sealed!
yes, sir, i sealed the room myself. nevertheless -- i am reading a life form there.
welcome aboard, admiral.
welcome home, jim.
where's doctor mccoy?
indisposed, sir.
ah, too bad... well... you have all done remarkable service under the most -- difficult of conditions. you'll be receiving starfleet's highest commendations, and more importantly, extended shore leaves.
admiral, i don't understand. the enterprise --
jim, the enterprise is twenty years old. we think her day is over...
but, we had requested -- we were hoping to take her back to genesis...
genesis?! whatever for?
why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
that's out of the question. no one is going to genesis!
may i ask why...?
jim, in your absence, genesis has become a galactic controversy... until the federation council makes policy, you are all under orders not to discuss with anyone your knowledge of genesis... consider it a quarantined planet. and a forbidden subject.
so!  speak!
great power... to control... dominate... destroy. if it works.
share this with no one.
understood, my lord.
we are going to this "planet." even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the federation, we will <u>act</u> for the preservation of our race! we will seize the secret of this weapon. the secret of ultimate power!
success, my lord.
station!
saavik to grissom. request computer study of soil samples for geological aging.
i'll handle that later.
my readings indicate great instability.
we're not here to investigate geological aging, we're here to find life forms!
grissom to landing party. we have you approaching radioactive indications. do you concur?
affirmative, captain. our readings are well below danger level.
very well. exercise caution, lieutenant. this landing is captain's discretion and i'm the one who's out on a limb.
i'll try to remember that, captain.
.          .. spock's tube...
david --
well. there's your life form reading. these were microbes on the tube's surface. we shot them here from enterprise.  they were fruitful, and multiplied.
but... how could they have evolved so quickly...?
what is it?
spock's burial robe.
... admiral, what's going to happen to enterprise?
she's to be decommissioned.
will we get another ship?
i can't get an answer. starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. no one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
how is doctor mccoy, sir?
that's the good news. he's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <u>stay</u> there... they say it's exhaustion...  we'll see.
ambassador, i -- i had no idea you were here...  i think you know my crew...
i will speak with you alone, kirk.
sarek... i would have come to vulcan... to express my deepest sympathies...
spare me your human platitudes, kirk. i have been to your government. i have seen the genesis information, and your own report.
then you know how bravely your son met his death.
"met his death"?  how could you, his friend, have assumed that? why did you leave him on genesis! spock trusted you -- and you denied him his future!
i -- saw no future --
you missed the point, then and now... only his body was "in death," kirk! and you were the last one to be with him.
yes, i was...
then you must know that you should have come with him to vulcan.
but -- why?
because he asked you to! he entrusted you with his very essence -- with everything was not of the body. he asked you to bring him to us -- and to bring that which he gave you: his katra. his living spirit.
sir. your son meant more to me than you can know. i'd have given my life if it would have saved his. you must believe me when i tell you that he made no request of me!
he would not have spoken of it openly.
then, how --
kirk, i must have your thoughts. may i join your mind?
of course...!
... he spoke of your friendship.
yes...
he asked you not to grieve...
... yes...
... the needs of the many outweigh...
... the needs of the few...
... or the one.
... spock...
i have been... and always shall be... your friend. live long... and prosper!
... no...! ` kirk, bathed with sweat, suddenly shudders in pain. sarek opens his eyes, removes his hands. he touches kirk with gentleness as jim recovers, opens his eyes.
forgive me. it is not here. i assumed he had mind-melded with you. it is the vulcan way when the body's end is near.
but he couldn't touch me...! we were separated!
i see... and i understand.  then everything that he was... everything that he knew... is lost. and when i return home empty-handed, many shall mourn.
please wait!... surely he would have found a way! if there was so much at stake -- spock would have found a way!
yes... but -- how...?
sarek!... what if he melded with someone else?!
bones!...
one alive, one not. yet both in pain.
what must i do?
you must bring them to mount selaya -- on vulcan. only there is the passage possible. only there can both find peace...
what you ask is difficult.
you will find a way, kirk. if you honor them both, you <u>must</u>.
captain, this is saavik. we have strong life sign readings bearing zero-one-five relative, and we are proceeding to investigate.
we concur, saavik. and saavik... be advised we are reading a severe and unnatural age curve on the planet. i'm getting nervous...
do you have an explanation?
later. let's go...
grissom, your message acknowledged. will advise... out.
jim... you are my best officer and if i had a best friend, you'd be that too. but i am commander, starfleet, so i don't break rules!
don't quote rules, harry! we're talking about loyalty. and sacrifice. one man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
now wait a minute! this business about spock  and mccoy... honestly, i have never understood vulcan mysticism -- i'm sorry! but part of me doesn't want you to make a fool of yourself... understand?
harry, you don't have to believe! i'm not even sure i believe. but if there's even a chance that spock has an eternal soul -- then that is my responsibility.
yours...?!
as surely as if it were my own!  harry, give me back the enterprise! with scotty's help...
no, jim! enterprise would never stand the pounding.
then i'll find a ship -- i'll hire a ship.
out of the question! the council has ordered that no one but the science team goes to genesis!
then let me speak to the council! harry, <u>please</u>! i can <u>make</u> them understand!!
yes... i hear you.  i just had to try.
of course... now take my suggestion, enjoy your leave -- and let all this tension blow away.
you're right.  thanks for the drink.
any time.
the word, sir?
the word is no.  i am therefore going anyway.
count on our help, sir.
i'll need it, sulu.
shall i alert dr. mccoy?
yes. he has a long journey ahead.
captain, this is saavik. come in, please...
yes, saavik, go ahead...
ah, saavik, that's, ah, extroadinary. what would you, ah, like to do next?
request permission to beam aboard immediately.
saavik... does dr. marcus think there could be -- any chance of -- ah -- radioactive contamination?
none that i can detect, sir.
well, all the same, i'm going to advise starfleet and get instructions.
i'm sure starfleet would approve, sir.
i know, but -- let's do it by the book. stand by on this channel.  go.
sir... something's jamming our transmission. an energy surge.
locate.
surge from astern, sir. aft quarter!
on screen.
captain, what's happening?!
we are under attack! stand by for evasive -- stand by for --
sir, may i suggest --
say the wrong thing, torg, and i will kill you too!
i only meant, my lord, that if it's prisoners you want --  there are life signs on the planet. perhaps the very scientists you seek.
saavik... my god, what happened to them?
it would seem that grissom was destroyed by an enemy attack.
you mean, we're stranded down here?!
logic indicates that is the case.
how can you be logical at a time like this?! we have to get thee hell off this planet!
that may be difficult...
why don't you just call for <u>help</u>!
i have already made one transmission too many...
it's time for total truth between us.  this planet is not what you intended, or hoped for, is it?
not exactly.
why?
i used protomatter in the genesis matrix.
protomatter. an unstable substance which every ethical scientist in the galaxy has denounced as dangerously unpredictable.
it was the only way to solve certain problems --
did your collaborator know?
my mother knew nothing about it. that's why i asked her to leave genesis in my hands.
so, like your father, you changed the rules...
if i hadn't, it might have been years -- or never!
and how many have paid the price for your impatience? how many have died? how much damage have you done... and what is yet to come?
unit two, this is one. the kobayashi maru has set sail for the promised land. acknowledge.
message acknowledged. all units will be informed.
you amaze me, commander.
how is that...?
a twenty year space veteran, yet you ask for the worst duty station in town. i mean, look at this place: the hind end of space.
peace and quiet appeals to me, lieutenant.
well, maybe that's okay for someone like you whose career is winding down. but me: i need some challenge in my life. some adventure... even just a surprise or two.
you know what they say, lieutenant. careful what you wish for: you may get it.
gentlemen. good evening.
good evening, commander. everything ready?
yes, admiral. step into my parlor.
commander, these are some of the most famous people in starfleet! admiral kirk, my god!
good for you, lieutenant.
but it's damn irregular. no destination orders, no encoded i.d...
all true.
well -- what are we going to do about it?!
i am going to do nothing about it. <u>you</u> are going to sit in the closet.
the <u>closet</u>?! have you lost all sense of reality?
this isn't reality. this is fantasy.
will you be able to handle that...?
oh, i'll have "mr. adventure" eating out of my hand. and i'll see you at the rendezvous.  all my hopes.
as promised, she's all yours, sir. all systems automated and ready. a chimpanzee and two trainees could run her.
thank you, mr. scott. i'll try not to take that personally.  my friends... i can't ask you to go any further. dr. mccoy and i have to do this. the rest of you do not.
mr. scott?
i'd be grateful, admiral, if you'd give the word.
gentlemen... may the wind be at our backs. stations please!
calm yourself, bones.
sir. commander, starfleet on emergency channel. he orders you to surrender this vessel.
no reply, chekov... continue on course...
status!
all automates ready and functioning. automatic moorings retracted. all speeds available through transwarp drive.
incredible machine. helmsman, one-quarter impulse power.
steady... steady... all right, mr. scott.
sir...?
the <u>doors</u>, mr. scott!
... we have cleared spacedoors.
full impulse power!
enterprise maintaining full impulse power...
and we are gaining... stand by, tractor beam!
tractor beam, aye!
if he tries to get away with warp drive, he's really in for a shock...
excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
mr. scott, we need everything you've got now.
warp speed, mr. sulu...
aye, sir, warp speed...
transwarp at your command, sir!
execute!
excelsior, the great experiment, is adrift in space.
mr. scott: as good as your word.
this planet is aging in surges.
and spock with it. they are joined together.
the genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. but at the rate things are going now...
... how long?
days... maybe hours... protomatter has made the situation unpredictable.  i'm sorry.
it will be hardest on spock. soon he will feel the burning of his vulcan blood.
i don't understand.
pon farr. vulcan males must endure it every seventh year of their adult life.
i still don't...
whoever they are, they're getting closer.
i'll go...
no!... i'll do it.  give me your phaser.
estimating genesis 2.9 hours, present speed.
can we hold speed, mr. scott?
aye, sir, she's got her second wind now.
scan for vessels in pursuit!
you did great, bones... just great.
sir, starfleet calling grissom again. a warning about us.
response?
nothing. as before.
what's grissom up to?... will they join us, or fire on us...?  chekov, break radio  silence. send my compliments to captain esteban.
aye, sir.
admiral, there is no response from the grissom on any channel.
keep trying, chekov. at regular intervals.
we are secured from warp speed... now entering genesis sector of mutara quadrant.
what about grissom, mr. chekov?
still no response, sir.
bones... can you give me a quadrant bi-scan?
i ordered no interruptions.
but sir! federation starship approaching.
i'd swear something was there sir, but i might have imagined it.
what did you see, chekov?
for an instant... a scout class vessel.
could be grissom.  patch in the hailing frequency.  u.s.s. grissom, this is enterprise calling. come in, please.
i say again: grissom, this is enterprise. admiral kirk calling captain esteban or lieutenant saavik. come in!
report status!
we are cloaked. enemy closing on impulse power. range, 5,000 kellicams.
good.  this is the turn of luck i have been waiting for.
nothing on my scanner, sir.
short range scan, mr. chekov... on screen, mr. sulu.
range: 3000 kellicams.
steady. continue on impulse power.
see! that shimmering area.
yes, sir. it's getting larger as we close in.
firing range, sir.

that distortion is closing rapidly... opinion, sulu?
i think it's an energy form, sir...
yes. enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
... a cloaking device?
red alert, mr. scott.
1,000 kellicams, closing!
wait!... wait...
mr. scott, all power to the weapons systems --
aye, sir!
mr. scott: two photon torpedoes at the ready. sight on the center of the mass.
aye, sir!
500 kellicams!

klingon bird of prey, sir! she's arming torpedoes...!
fire, mr. scott!
good shooting, scotty.
aye, those two hits should stop a horse, let alone a bird.
precautionary, mr. chekov. shields up...
sir, the shields... non- responsive.
scotty...?

torpedoes coming in -- !
i'm all right -- stand by to return fire! mr. scott, transfer power to the phaser banks --
oh, god, sir, i dinna think so...
what's wrong?
they've knocked out the damn automation center.  i've got no control over anything!
why haven't they finished us?... they outgun me ten to one; they have four hundred in crew to my handful, yet they sit there.
perhaps they wish to take you prisoner.
they know we would die first.
my lord, enemy commander wishes a truce to confer.
put him on screen!  study him well.
how can you tell that?
i trust my instincts.  admiral kirk. this is your opponent speaking.
do not lecture me about treaty violations. the federation, in creating an ultimate weapon, has become a gang of intergalactic criminals. it is not i who will surrender, it is you.  on the planet below, i have three prisoners from the team who developed your doomsday weapon. if you do not surrender immediately, i will execute them, one at a time, as enemies of galactic peace.
who is this?! how dare you --
who i am is not important. that i have them is.  i will let you speak to them.
admiral, this is lieutenant saavik.
saavik... is... david with you?
yes, he is. and someone else. vulcan scientist of your acquaintance.
this vulcan -- is he alive?
he is not himself -- but he lives. he is subject to rapid aging -- like this unstable planet.
hello, sir. it's david.
david... sorry i'm late.
it's okay -- i should have known you'd come... saavik's right: this planet is unstable. it's going to destroy itself in a matter of hours.
david!... what went wrong?
i went wrong.
david, i don't understand...
i'm sorry, sir. just don't surrender. genesis doesn't work! i can't believe they'll kill us for it --
david?... david!
admiral, your young friend is mistaken. i meant what i said. and now, to show my intentions are sincere... i am going to kill one of the prisoners.
wait! give me a chance --

there are two more prisoners, admiral. do you want them killed too?  surrender your vessel!
all right, damn you! all right!  give me a minute to inform my crew.
i give two minutes. for you, and your gallant crew.  take every last man: form a boarding party, armed heavily!
they outnumber us, my lord --
<u>we are klingons</u>! once you control the ship, i will transfer my flag there. and we will take genesis from their own memory banks!
mr. sulu, what is the crew complement of a bird of prey?
about a dozen officers and men.
with some on the planet...
commander, klingon vessel. stand by to board this ship on my next signal.
no tricks, kirk. you have one minute.
no tricks. i'm looking forward to meeting you. kirk out.
sir, planet core readings unstable... changing rapidly...
what about surface life signs...?
close... there --
come on!
my lord... what are your orders?
i underestimated him... he did the one thing i didn't anticipate ... he destroyed himself...
sir, may i --
killing his son was <u>stupid</u>! it made kirk willing to die.
we still have the prisoners, sir. perhaps their information --
they are useless! it was kirk i needed. and i let him slip away.
but surely, our mission has not failed -- ?
our mission is over. i have failed... a human has been bolder and more ruthless than i...  that -- is the real dishonor.
what happened...?
he gave his life to save us. that is all i know.
is there <u>anything</u> we can do?!
only one thing, sir... get him off this planet... his aging is part of what's going on around us...
maltz. prisoners are at beam coordinates. standby...
you should take the vulcan, too.
no.
but, why?
because you wish it.
genesis, i want it.
beam the vulcan up -- and we talk.
give me what i want -- and i'll consider it...
you fool -- look around you! this planet is destroying itself!
yes. exhilarating, isn't it!
if we don't help each other, we'll all die here!
perfect! that's the way it shall be!... <u>give me genesis</u>!
give me your hand and we both live.

don't be a fool -- give me your hand!
how many more?
just him, sir!
bones, help spock! everyone else, find a station!
if i read this right, sir, we have full power.
go, sulu!
the genesis planet is gone.
goodbye, david.
we are clear and free to navigate.
best speed to vulcan. mr. chekov, take the prisoners below.
yes, admiral. but that may not be possible.
what? what are you saying?
the katra ritual is meant to deposit spock's consciousness in the hall of ancient thought - not in his body.
but we have spock alive! that's more than we bargained for!
or less. what you describe is called fal tor pan - the refusion. it is very dangerous. the elders may not choose to attempt it.
and if they don't.? what will happen to spock?
. he will remain always as he is.
the planet vulcan. in hailing distance, sir.
saavik. send to ambassador sarek. tell him we're coming in.
mr. sulu, you're on manual.
it's been a while, sir. here we go... retrothrusters!
my god...
much is at stake...
what about spock?
i am not sure. only time will answer.  kirk. i thank you. what you have done is --
what i have done, i had to do.
but at what cost? your ship... your son.
if i hadn't tried, the cost would have been my soul.
i know you... do i not?
yes. and i know you.
my father says you have been my friend... you came back for me.
you would have done the same for me.
why would you do this...?
because... the needs of the one outweighed the needs of the many.
yes, yes, spock...
the ship... out of danger...?
you saved the ship, spock. you saved us all. don't you remember?!
