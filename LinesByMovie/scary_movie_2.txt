uh... I am father mcfeely
father, come in, please.
I am so glad you are here.
i came as fast as i could, but at my age the little soldier needs a lot more thumpin before it starts pumpin. if i tickle my ass before...
it is okay. i understand.
how is she?
she is gotten worse, father. she will not eat, she will not talk. the child will not even let me touch her.
yes... sometimes you have to give them candy.
father.
not unless you have a paternity test to prove it.
would you like to see the girl?
soon. first, i must bless this house.
father, are you okay?
yeah, but you might wanna light a match before you go in there.  did you bring my bag?
yes.
then let us prepare.
remember, do not ask her too many questions.
because she will lie?
no, because her breath smells like a horse's ass.
oh shit, you gonna take that?
what?
what she said about your mother?
no thanks.
my holy water.
father, i think you should rest.
no, I am fine.
so, do you think you made it into the class?
i do not know, but i sure hope so.
you could use the grade, huh?
nah, i need a place to stay. so how do you like being in college?
okay, i guess. it is so intimidating. you know being away from home, not knowing anyone. i feel like such a geek sometimes. everyone's so cool and I am so not.
aww, you am not that bad. you just need a little flava. first thing we got to do is get you some new gear.
huh?
gear. you know, clothing.
oh.
let's start with some rhythm. sway back and forth like this.
left, right, left, right, crossover kick...
now you gotta learn the correct slang.
yo! that jacket is tight.
yeah, now go uhn, uhn, uhn!
uhn! uhn! uhn!
yeah, you feel that? now put it all together.
am i cool now?
almost... look, i got to bounce. I will holla at you later.
i woke up naked, too.
hey, dude, you got a tattoo.
what does it say?
it says, "ray."
sweet. hey, you got a tattoo, too.
get out?! what does it say?
"fucked me."
aww. cool. dude.
"ray!"
"fucked me."
"ray!"
"fucked me."
are you okay?
yeah, I am fine. i just broke up with my boyfriend, that is all.
that is always tough. how long were you together?
well, we never made it official, so i guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but i was seeing him in school. i saw him at the mall about six months ago and i was too nervous to introduce myself so i followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. it was registered to his mother, so i went to her house. she was so nice. i mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz i never really spoke to her. i just waited til she went to work then i climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. i say borrowed because I am going to give it back one day. but anyway, i called everyone in it til i found her son. he was not home when i called so i left this message how much in love i was with him. i was, and how i wanted to have his children. just really opening up, and he never called back. I would call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later i just decided i deserved better. what about you? do you have a boyfriend?
no, i have not dated in a while. my last boyfriend's...
hey, brenda.
do i know you?
well, actually, we have never met officially, but i bumped into you at the cafeteria and you were so sweet. i said, "i'm sorry," and you said, "watch it, white bitch, or I will put my size eight in your ass." i thought how cool. i wear a size eight, too. anyway, this is my best friend, cindy.
we already know each other. hey, brenda.
hey, cindy. your friend needs help.
actually, i just met her. this is alex.
oh my god. madam elsa, my psychic, told me i would meet somebody whose name starts with a letter of the alphabet today.
really? that is amazing.
hey girl, that jacket is slamming.
thanks.
you better be careful. i heard some girl got her ass whooped and jacket stolen earlier today.  hey, what class do we have next?
psychology.
me, too. 101?
in room "302" at ten o'clock?
that is it.
oh, this is too much. I am going to have to play these numbers. remind me to pick up a lotto ticket.
i finished all the interviews.
let me see the files.
they are on top of the bookshelf. I will get them.
let me help you.
i do not need your help. I am perfectly capable.
here you go, professor.
are these all the subjects?
yes. the scored all over the kiersey temperament sorter just like you asked for.
any of them hot?
i also took the liberty of putting those with near-death experiences on top.
good thinking, dwight. traumatized co-eds are a sure thing.
as i am sure you are aware, professor, subjects who are close to death are statistically more likely to have the suggestibility required for paranormal investigation, which is, of course, why I have given them special consideration.
look, whatever you say, kid, but the more they are hurtin', the more they need a squirtin', if you know what i mean.  ooh, i like her.
cindy campbell. classic abandoned personality disorder. she seems guarded, but willing to do this.
willing? i like that.  and, this one?
that is ray williams. i could not quite figure him out, but he seemed very eager and excited when we met.
what is this?
car accident, gun shot, multiple stabbings, a hook through the back... where did you find these kids?
they are the survivors of the steveston county massacre.
fantastic. these kids are exactly the kind of catalyst needed to awaken hell house.
how are we going to get them all up there?
I will make it part of the class. we will tell them they are participating in a study on sleep disorders.
and what happens when all hell breaks loose?
we record and document it. we are going to make history, dwight. the first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. the book sales alone will be worth millions. I will be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. now, what time is orientation?
in about fifteen minutes.
remember, dwight, not a word to anyone.
I am sorry, i should have been watching where i...
it is okay.
oh, my god, ray! what are you doing here?
it is the sequel.
oh, right.
listen, no need for you to worry. all that stuff that happened before is behind us. let's just try to move on.
i am. so just do me a favor and stay away from me.
hello brenda.
hello ray.
would you like me to help you pass them back?
i do not need your help.
hey, you left your book back there.
thanks. I am cindy.
so, i see you are really into spooks.
no. i never date outside my race.
i meant you are into ghosts.
oh, yeah. I am just curious about that kind of stuff.
so it looks like we are going to be spending the weekend together.
yeah.
maybe we can study together or something.
I am sorry, buddy. you seem really nice, but I am just getting over a really bad relationship, and I am not ready to start dating yet.
but, hey, maybe we can be friends.
sure, that would be cool. friends.
okay. see you later, friend.
oh my god! I am here with the...
yes, professor oldman's group. forgive me. i did not mean to frighten you.
I am cindy.
I am hanson the caretaker.
i have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. we want to be safe.
right. what about condoms?
professor!
hey, you are the one who brought up safety. I am perfectly willing to go in raw.
would you please focus?
fine.  what is all this stuff?
well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances.
are those cameras all throughout the house?
yes, i thought that it would be best.
even in the bathroom?
so, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do i press to get a close- up?
that one.
after dinner, you and i will take shifts throughout the night. i do not want to chance miss anything.
excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. dinner will be ready shortly.
thanks, handyman.
I am the caretaker, not the handyman.  nice skates. be careful. you do not want to fall and break something.
I am going to change for dinner. I will see you shortly.
sounds good. I am just going to run up to my room. hop in the shower. jump into my jogging suit, and I will be right there.
hi buddy.
open chest!!!
it is the best seat in the house. i warmed it up for you.
second best.
professor, is this the same house that a young girl was possessed by a demon or something?
yes, it was reported, but never substantiated.
not to worry. there is been no reported activity in the house for over twenty years.
let's not forget, folks, this is a study on sleep disorders.
ah, yes, which reminds me, who here thinks they would wake up if somebody snuck into their room and started sniffing between their legs?
how about these buns?
yeah, they are so warm and soft.
ummm!! they smell delicious.
thanks. i made them by hand.
who is first? anyone like a wing?
yours, or the turkeys?
i supposed you would like a leg. how about two?
that is it. I am going to put my food in your ass. i should warn you, I am a black belt in karate.
professor, what is the history of this house?
I am glad you asked. it actually makes for a pretty good bedtime story.
this house was built in 1898 by a man named archibald keaton as a gift to his wife, cora.
yes, i feel their spirits. cora... keaton... i am here to communicate...
no, they sold the house in 1920 to a millionaire, uriah bloodworth.
yes, of course, uriah. i feel his evil presence.
no, he lost the house after the stock market crash.
but he could still be haunting the house. he is angry that he had to leave.
he is not dead, you idiot. he lives in florida. now, shut up and let me finish.
ouch!!
brenda, are you okay? come sit.
no, you do not understand. it is here in these statues...
my god! is she dead?
no, they are just powder burns, thank god. they were empty. get her upstairs.
professor, i think you should see this.
what is it? some tits? a beaver shot? what?
no, these are the tapes from the living room. check this out.
the image there.
are you sure it is not the tape?
i do not think so. it is on all the cameras, and check this out. the thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
congratulations, dwight, it is begun.
aww, the little bird died.
yeah, i did not know what else to do.
hey, i got an idea.
that was a great idea, shorty.
i told you it would taste just like chicken.
did you do that?
uh, uh.
you better go get dwight and the professor.
alright, cindy, what is so important?
professor, you guys gotta see this. dwight, come here.
what the hell are you doing?
just wait, you will see.
yippie! was not that amazing?
it is some kind of energy field. we better record this.
got my camera right here.
i got it!
that is fantastic. our first phenomenon. this is going to be a great weekend. you guys better get some sleep. dwight and i will take over from here.
you know, buddy, about this friendship thing...
yeah, it is great, is not it. i think it is so cool... have a girl as a friend.
that is just it, buddy. I am a girl. you can not be so rough with me.
then what kinda stuff can we do?
gentle stuff like talking, sharing thoughts and ideas, secrets and past experiences. stuff like that, you know.
it sounds gay, but guess since you are a girl it is okay, huh?
yeah, it will be fine. i wanna check something out. will you come with me?
sure. we can practice talking.
okay.
buddy...
wait, I am just about to tell you the best part.
dude, somebody is on the rag.
shhh!
whoa, check this out. she looks like you.
wow, she is beautiful. you really think she looks like me?
her hair does not have as many split ends at yours. her skin is not as oily as yours, either. also, sometimes your eyes get kinda squinty and they look like you might have down's syndrome or something. otherwise the resemblance is uncanny.
oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. more feminine. and her tits are perfect. not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
alright!
shhh... it is okay.
ray, have you been here all this time?
i just wanted to make sure you were okay.
I am fine. just a few bruises.
so, i guess i can go now.
no, stay.
you sure?
yeah, i think I will feel better sleeping in the arms of a strong man.
yeah, me too.
are you okay? i thought i heard screaming.
oh, I am fine... just clowning around.
are you okay?
i think so.
come on. we better get you cleaned up.
I am telling you, it was possessed.
theo, did you see the animal?
no, i just heard the commotion, and when i got there i guess it was gone.
what, you think i did this to myself?
no, I am just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it does not mean it was possessed. maybe the two of you should sleep together.
what are you getting at, professor?
only that if this cat did attack, he is less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. come on, it is college. time for you two to experiment.
good idea, and do not forget to give her a good-night kiss.
there is something going on in this house. I am not crazy.
good-night, cin. I will be next door if you need me.
thanks, I will be fine.
got a problem with that?
yeah, bitch, give me my apple. what is gotten into you?
i take it you are not mad at me.
i would not go that far.
i do not like this, this...
why do not you shut up, professor? just relax.
i think she is starting to suspect something?
who?
oh, my god. it happened right here. she came home. she saw them.
saw who?!
do not touch me!!
what the hell?!
it is not what is looks like. she is having a breakdown. help me get her to her room.
professor, we need to talk.
what is it, dwight?
i think we should consider cutting the experiment short.
what?
the force in this house is far greater than i anticipated. in one night i recorded cold spots, shifting magnetic fields, the e.u.p. is picking up white sounds everywhere.
that is why we came here, remember?
yes, but I have seen the tapes. this poltergeist is becoming increasingly more violent. we all could be in danger. i say we pull the plug.
whoa, dwight, i say when we pull the plug. get a hold of yourself. dwight, we are on the verge of greatness and I am about this close to getting laid. now, the bus will be here on monday. until then no one leaves.
brenda was right. there is more to the story than the professor told us. i found a secret room. it had all these news clippings about hugh kane. he was a very evil man.
ah, they just do not know you the way i do.
i found a picture of his wife.
wife?!
okay, i get the point.
so, whatever happened to her?
she killed herself a week before he died.
oh, he was a widower. why did not you say that?...  do not worry, sweetie, i can whip up a new batch in a flash.
i think he wants me.
ha! right bitch!
hello dwight.
hi.
what are you working on?
just a little experiment.
work, work, work. is that all that you do?
well, there is a lot riding on this project.
the professor might have everyone else fooled, but i know who the real brains of the operation is.
you do.
that is what turns me on about you, dwight. you are so smart.
and sexy.
of course. so sexy.
ooh, you hair is so soft and silky. what do you use on it?
just a little rogaine.
you know, dwight, i hear you are the only one who has the key to the gate.
that is right.
what if i wanted to borrow those keys?
oh, i could not do that.
i can do it myself.
yeah, i can see that. later i want you to teach me that trick, but right now we have a job to do.
the keys. she took the keys.
he will not let us go. he is going to kill us.
quick, everyone to the lab.
what are we gonna do?
we have to destroy him.
he is right. i should go first.
he is so brave.
no, i will not let you do it.
alex, what are you doing?
shut up, you slut. you think you can take him from me? well, over my dead body.
let her go, cin.
but he will kill her!
that means more screen time for us.
she is right. we should stick together.
alright. come on, you guys.
and remember that trip we took to africa? that safari was so wonderful. me, you... best of friends... forever.
uh, alex, we have only know each other one day.
oh... i guess I will die now.
okay... maybe that would be best.
oh, remember that time i got my training bra and you --
never happened!
my favorite memory was when we --
would you die already?!
where is shorty?
i do not know. he was right behind us. wait here. I will be right back.
where the hell are we?
it looks like the furnace.
let's get outta here.
wait, i want to check something. give me a hand.
well, if that is hanson, then who is the guy with the hand?
hugh kane.
help!
now, why that bitch got to bring that shit this way? i hope she did not see me.
oh my god! we are dead!
it would have just been you, if you would have kept your mouth shut.
it is coming!
what?! what is it, a monster?!
hey, look, I am wilma flintstone.
hey, i have an idea...
oh my god, the ghost has buddy! brenda do something!
okay.
yeah, i think I am bleeding.
come on. there is a first aid kit in the lab.
cindy, I have been thinking about this whole friend thing. i never had a friend that cares for me the way you do... i mean, there is ray, but he cares for me in a different way. you know, bringing me flowers. running my bath water. and then there is nights i wake up screaming and i look over and ray's in my bed. holding me. and seeing that tonight might be our last night together, i was thinking...
that we should take our friendship a little further?
yes...
oh, buddy, i was thinking the same thing. it might be our last night in this house. and i think we should take full advantage of it.
i was thinking the same thing.
we should act out our inner most fantasies.
great!!!
like, I have always wanted to walk on the moon.
huh?
what about you, buddy?
well, i was hoping to get my balls licked.
he is here.
shit!
what are we going to do? I am cold. i can not move, I am so cold.
can you feel that?
no. try a little higher.
feel that?
no. keep rubbing.
better try a little higher.
now, come on -- you know I am not ready for that kind of --
cindy, please! it is a matter of life and death. I am asking you a friend.
well... okay... but only as a friend.
come in somebody. can you hear me?
this is ray. what is up? where are you?
the ghost is close. he almost got us. buddy is hurt.
what is your location? i repeat, what is your location?
right behind you.
where is shorty?
i do not know. he was right behind me a minute ago.
morphine? chloroform? horse tranquilizers? you have drugged him!
no, actually, i found him like this. that is his stuff.
sit down and join us, cindy.
yeah, i always wanted to watch you eat.
she would have to be really pretty and I would have to be very drunk.
I am going to work in washington, cindy.
are you?
that is where my best customers are. marion berry, george bush, the redskins. I would like to offer you a job, cindy. can you type? take dictation? swallow balloons filled with cocaine?
now you are being rude, shorty.
washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask jesse jackson.
yo son, check this out.
dog, you look hot.
hanson, please.
do not worry cindy, the brain itself feels no pain.
stop touching his brain!
um, I am not touching anything.
sorry, y'all. my bad.
shorty, why do not you say grace?
me? grace? okay -- dear god --
this part removes the sense of humor.
i am tom green, i am tom green. daddy want some sausage, sausage. daddy want some sausage...
tell me, cindy. would you ever tell me "stop. if you loved me you would stop."
not in a thousand years.
stop! --
made you say it!
cindy, what is going on?
it is hanson, he is evil. let's get him!
you never could feel your legs.
what do you know about it?!... listen, the ghost is too powerful. the only chance we have is to use this machine.  i need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
alright... i might need your help.
my help?
a little bit... give me your belt.
I am not even wearing any drawers. forget about a belt.
okay, give me my belt.
you are not wearing a belt.
alright, go to the belt store...
someone is going to have to lure him onto the platform.
I will go.
cindy, let me...
no, buddy, I am the one he wants.
actually, i was going to say let me have your computer if you die.
cool, but remember, as soon as he gets on the platform you gotta get out of there.  nobody wants to go.
alright, let's take a vote...
ray, run faster.
okay.
ray, you saved my life. are you okay?
yeah, i broke my fall.
hey, y'all! what is going on?
shorty! you are alive!! but... what about your head?
that turned out to be a good thing! it is going to make smuggling a whole lot easier. remember that weed? I am about to get paid.
father!
my child, you are alive!
yes, we made it!
we? what do you mean... we?
me and my friends... you see there was this ghost. he came out of nowhere and....
my child you are the only survivor.
no, my friends are right here!
I am sorry.
father, i do not understand. tell me what happened?
soon, but first i must bless this house.
you mean to tell me we are dead!
i guess so.
yo' tommy, what up, man?
I am totally freakin' dude. i keep having these nightmares, then i wake up screaming with these awful back spasms. i can not take it anymore, man.
aww, man. you just need to chill out. come on, there is this party tonight it is going to be fun. lot's of alcohol and honeys.
alright, but i am not drinking. and you are going to have to look after me.
do not worry, i got your back.
there is something i really want to share with you.
there is something i want to share with you too. here, smell this.
cindy, about this whole friendship thing...
yeah, i know, i just love having a guy for a friend.
i know, but I have been thinking --
i know, but I have been thinking --
listen to me i --
listen to me i --
look, what I am trying to say --
look, what I am trying to say --
stop it! I am just trying to say i think we should take our friendship to the next level.
oh.
i do not want to be your friend like this anymore.
then what are we going to do?
you know, walking on the beach, holding hands, kissing, making love...
that sounds kinda gay, but since you are a guy, i guess it is okay.
let's get a hot dog.
hey, look out, a bee!
oh, buddy, I have never had someone be so protective of me!
that is what your man is supposed to do.
hey, wanna' share a soda?
oh, buddy, that is so romantic.
yeah.  can i borrow five bucks?
what should we get?
i do not care. you pick.
hot dogs.
it was you...
yes, it was me all along. i killed hugh kane and his mistress.
both of them?
did not i just say that? fucking listen. anyway, i did it all for carolyn. he never appreciated her, but i worshipped that woman and still she rejected me. so, i came back for you. just like i did for carolyn.
this can not be happening?
now you will be mine, cindy.
noooo!!!
yes!!!!
